        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please comment your thoughts. Discussion could result in most universally valuable features being implemented in future builds.
Function 1 (software-implemented): Optional Visual Hierarchical Display of Saved Searches
Without affecting any other functionality, saved searched should be able to be organized into a visual expandable drop-down hierarchy, which again does not affect any other functionality, so does not implement hierarchical structuring into any aspect of the application other than the visual representation of the saved searches in the sidebar. This has obvious beneficial functionality without breaking the app. Feel free to discuss.
Function 2 (user-implemented): Bundled Tags
Right now, if I have tags #apple #banana & #pear, I am able to create a saved search called "Fruits" which saves the search query as "#apple OR #banana OR #pear". It would be advisable, in some instances, for you as the user to add the category name itself as a tag to the existing search parameters, such that the new search query is now saved as "#apple OR #banana OR #pear or #fruits". This allows the saved search to function as a category as well as a tag.
I call these types of saved searches "Categories", and the tags that represent the saved search redundantly "Category Tags"
^^^ Combining the above two functions does not deviate from to the existing principles underpinning the stated purpose of this application, yet it does serve to improve the functionality in terms of specificity (via Tags) and inclusion (via Categories).
Further extending these functions, one can imagine a nested list of category tags
For examples of infinite-depth, internally-nested collapsible lists - which would all be great functionality add to the "Saved Searches" sidebar of the Archive - check out the Workflowy app: https://workflowy.com/

 I am a junior scala/spark developer working on a project. In this project, I have a main method which takes in a config as arguments, and the trouble I'm having is that this config is required throughout the whole project, in the majority of all of my functions, objects and classes. I have tried solving this issue by adding the config as an implicit parameter everywhere, but I'm curious if there are better ways of solving the issue. I am trying to to this in a functional programming way and maintaining immutability. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I write technical reports at work with org-mode and am wondering if anyone has tricks to better format the output of source blocks that generate tibbles. Here's two attempts:
 This is my typical setup, and it's including the description with the output. Not horrible, but I don't really want that (nor the variable types) in my output.
 #+begin_src R :session :exports results :results output wrap foo <- tibble( x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c("a", "b", "c")) foo #+end_src #+RESULTS: :results: # A tibble: 3 × 2 x y <dbl> <chr> 1 1 a 2 2 b 3 3 c :end: 
 I could switch to using value, which gives me an org table, but then I lose the column headers for some reason.
 #+begin_src R :session :exports results :results value foo <- tibble( x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c("a", "b", "c")) foo #+end_src #+RESULTS: | 1 | a | | 2 | b | | 3 | c | 
 Here's the default data frame output, but I'd prefer not to have to wrap everything I do in data.frame() just to get the desired output.
 #+begin_src R :session :exports results :results output wrap bar <- data.frame( x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c("a", "b", "c")) bar #+end_src #+RESULTS: :results: x y 1 1 a 2 2 b 3 3 c :end: 
 I'd be happy with either a) org tables including the header row, or b) tibble raw output, but without the # A tibble: n x m and <type> bits (though I'd accept the latter).
 I saw options for tibbles calling out max footer lines, but nothing about headers here in the suggested pillar options. I found this github issue which reqeusts more granular printing options, which would not then require any org-specific processing.
 In the meantime, it basically suggests overriding the print function with the what amounts to wrapping as a data.frame. Since that issue is locked, I just created another one to re-start that 2018 discussion now that it's 2022.
 In the meantime, anyone dealt with this and have workarounds?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I recently started using emacs and I'm coming from vscode (with vim emulation, I can't leave vim keybindings), and one of the things that are keeping me from going all-in with emacs, is the fact that there is no "clear" way to customize emacs and get what you want, or at least it's not clear to beginners.
 For example, in vscode there is syntax highlighting for a huge amount of languages, and if I want more complete support for a specific language I can install an extension easy peasy from the extension tab, in emacs, on the other hand, I would have to search for a package, install it, learn what it can do and configure it. It's somewhat daunting for someone who is not an expert like me.
 Do you guys have any advice on how to customize emacs in a simple yet efficient way (I know there are some pre-configured distros like doom or space, I still have to look into those)? My aim is to be able to add whatever feature to my emacs config easily because I want it to be feature rich.
 In the end, emacs seems to be a really powerful tool compared to vscode (which I think is already pretty powerful), but it's not clear *how* you should use it...

 I finished Haskell Programming From First Principles a few days ago, and I'm trying to figure out how to write up a resume to land my first job in 'real' software, as opposed to IT.
 My position before this was a kind of junior cloud sysadmin / hosting engineer gig, which I filled with as much Azure and PowerShell as I could get them to give me.

 I have the requirement to search for checkboxes that are located within a resolved heading that has any todo keyword which is DONE or CANCELLED on my side. Bonus points for finding unchecked checkboxes in any sub-heading (with or without todo keywords!) of resolved headings.
 With my limited Elisp knowledge, I'd take one of my simple Python parsers and adapt it accordingly so that I get heading-IDs and their unchecked checkboxes as stdout output.
 However, I think that this is something that others may have already solved in a more elegant (Elisp) fashion.
 So: do you know any existing approach that solves this task already before I start implementing on my own?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really hope I haven't wandered down a dead-end here. I have a Behaviour that gives the currently selected Color, and the current mouse coordinates, then carries out a task when the mouse is clicked. That task involves looking at a list and then updating the values in that list, for it to be retrieved later. The fact that I can "store" the selected color gives me hope that storing a list can be done in a similar manner. I'm just at a dead end and not sure how to solve this. Would really appreciate some help.
 ``` -- There is a Blue button and a Red button on our UI. Whichever -- button was clicked last is our current color selection.
 colorRedSelected = const ColorRed <$ UI.click redButton colorBlueSelected = const ColorBlue <$ UI.click blueButton
 -- we combine both the above Events to create a new one that tells us the current selected color
 colorSelected = unionWith const colorRedSelected colorBlueSelected
 -- accumulate values for our Behaviour, starting with ColorRed selected by default
 colorMode <- accumB ColorRed modeEvent
 -- create a Behaviour
 mouseCoordinate <- stepper (0,0) $ UI.mousemove canvas
 -- want to start with the list [1,2,3,4], but this value should change later. -- I have 'never' here, as I don't know what else to put here yet.
 listState <- accumB ([1,2,3,4]) never
 -- Combine the Behaviours, we now have a tuple (chosenColorMode, mouseCoordinateTuple, savedList)
 let choices = (,,) <$> colorMode <> mouseCoordinate <> listState
 -- Apply the event (of the user clicking the canvas) to the Behaviour, -- creating a new Event that returns the above tuple when it fires 
 makeChoice = choicePosition <@ UI.click canvas
 onEvent makeChoice $ (colorMode, (x,y), savedList) -> do ... -- in this block we use the savedList, and generate a newList. -- I want to update the choicePosition behaviour so that the newList -- replaces the old savedList. ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have hard time to toggle different prefix-command in Emacs.
 I try to define two functions to toggle my own two prefix-command:
 The prefix keys are the following period and single quote  . and ` 
 Here are my two functions ``` (defun mykeyMap1() "prefix-command => ." (interactive) (progn (define-prefix-command 'myprefix-map) (global-set-key (kbd ".") 'myprefix-map) (global-set-key (kbd ". 1") 'shell-command)
 ))
 (defun mykeyMap2() "prefix-command => " (interactive) (progn (define-prefix-command 'myprefix-map) (global-set-key (kbd "") 'myprefix-map) (global-set-key (kbd "1") 'shell-command) )) ``
 Both functions are in my init.el file. 
 Reload my init.el file.
 Run mykeyMap1, it works (.). Now, period is my prefix key
 But if I run mykeyMap2, prefix key (`) does not work.
 My question is.
 Do I need to unbind myprefix-map before rebind it again to other prefix-command ?
 What is the simplest way to rebind my prefix-command so that I can switch different prefix key anytime I want ?

 I have a few orgmode files for my todos and whatnot, but I am struggling to have them synced across my laptops and my desktop. I have tried using a git repo, but too often I forgot to push my changes when transitioning from home (laptop) to office(desktop), or vice versa. I tried using a nextcloud dir, but this quickly filled with "(conflicted copy)" copies, making keeping track of the latest version a hell.
 IMO the git route is most robust, but does anybody have a tip on how to manage it in an automagic dwiw way ? 
 Crontabbing a pull && commit && push cycle is imo too hamfisted, but I am not above it. Keeping the org files on a tramp-accessible server is too confined (esp when exporting etc).
 Or maybe a solution I have not tought of ?
 ​
 thx

 This is related to another post I had put up a couple hours back. It got me thinking about what you guys and girls feel is a fair salary for a Haskell developer.
 To keep things consistent, let me know what you think about the "monthly" salary for a developer with:
 a. Little to no experience with production Haskell.
 b. 1-2 years experience
 c. 2-5 years experience
 d. 5 years+
 Curious to see what ya'll think!

 I am trying to enable history, could someone please help with following?
 1, I am using counsel-M-x with smex, it makes last used commands displayed first, but is it also possible to cycle back/forward the command history like in regular M-x with up/down keys? Function is “previous-line-or-history-element”, but when i try it in Counsel-M-x it simply closes the mini-buffer, same with “ivy-previous-line-or-history”.
 2, Is it possible to achieve same for M-: (pp-eval-expression), after connecting Counsel-M-x/smex they stopped working.
 3, and for C-h v|f?
 4, Is it possible to make 1,2,3 persistent across sessions?
 5, What’s the relationship between smex and savehist? Does one depend on the other? What’s the difference between them? (currently i don’t have savehist enabled) 
 p.s. This is my counsel-M-x / smex config:
 (use-package ivy :config (ivy-mode 1) (setq ivy-re-builders-alist '((t . ivy--regex-ignore-order))) (setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t) (setq ivy-count-format "(%d/%d)") (setq ivy-initial-inputs-alist nil) ) (use-package counsel :config (counsel-mode 1) ) (use-package smex )

 As a course project, I am trying to implement a (simulation) of the Raft protocol. In this post, I will not use Raft terminology at all; instead, I will use a simplified one.
 The protocol is run by a number of servers (for example, 5) which can be in three different states (A, B, C). The servers inherit some state variables and behavior from a "base" kind, but they all also have many unique state variables …]]></summary>

 I've got a SaaS operation (built with Haskell) that now has paying users. I want to start shipping features faster and get some help on the dev side so I can focus on growing the user base. Based on the revenue from the business right now, I can pay a salary of $2k/month USD full time.
 My questions:
  
What kind of talent do you think I can get at that salary level?
 Do you think it would be better to hire and train now or hire at a later stage once the user base is larger and I can afford a higher salary?
 Where would you look for devs? Any general tips?
  
Either way, depending on the experience of the dev, I'd bump up the salary as the app continues to acquire more users.
 I appreciate any input and feedback :)
 EDIT #1
  
I'm talking $2k USD per month.
 I'd be willing to modify the contract so the dev can have a much higher upside if the business is successful - something on the lines of high bonuses on milestones, or some kind of profit sharing.
 My eventual goal is to pay the best and most competitive salaries in the industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am making a minor mode for entering commands with one keystroke and I was wondering if it's possible to bind a command to keys like ctrl, alt and capslock like this:
 (define-minor-mode some-mode ;; The initial value. nil ;; The indicator for the mode line. " some-mode" ;; The minor mode bindings. '(((kbd "SPC") . some-function) ;; I know space can be bound to like this ((kbd "RET") . some-other-function) ;; and return like this ((kbd "CTRL") . function3) ((kbd "META") . function4) ((kbd "CAPSLOCK") . function5) ;; But the last three kbd functions yield the string argument itself )) 
 Is binding to ctrl and meta alone possible at all? If so, how would one accomplish this within a minor mode definition?
 Thanks
 Edit: After I posted here I found a similar problem to mine, which the poster solved with an OS-level workaround. This would not really be a great solution for me since it would also change behavior outside of Emacs. But I thought I should leave it here in case someone with a similar problem finds this post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I couldn't find this solution anywhere online so I thought I'd share, sorry if it's been discussed before.
 In my case I wanted to have a FromField & ToField instance (coming from the sqlite-simple package) for UUID fields (coming from the uuid package). It can be achieved without newtype wrapping or having orphan instances, using the DerivingVia GHC extension:
 newtype SqlUUID a = MkSqlUUID a instance (a ~ UUID) => FromField a where fromField field = ... -- The definition is not really interesting, same as you would write for a UUID minus the MkSqlUUID wrapping instance (a ~ UUID) => ToField a where toField (MkSqlUUID uuid) = ... -- Again, not really interesting -- In another module: newtype UserId = MkUserId UUID deriving FromField via (SqlUUID UUID) deriving ToField via (SqlUUID UUID) 
 I've tested this and it seems to work but I'm not a very experienced haskell so there might be some downsides/pitfalls using this method that I'm not aware of. Let me know what you think :)
 Edit: probably should've been more clear. It doesn't solve the orphan instances problem in general but previously I needed an orphan FromField UUID and ToField UUID so I can do deriving FromField for my UserId type.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I am an undergrad who recently fell in love with Haskell (~4 months!). As a hobby project, I am building a collaborative web-based code editor with a Haskell-backend and a Typescript+React frontend.
 I have finished implementing the Operational Transformation logic (the core logic behind resolving multiple asynchronous edits to a central document) in Haskell, and am now in the process of designing the backend. Architecturally, I think clients communicating with the server via WebSockets would be the obvious choice.
 To that end, what would be the best tool to set up WebSocket servers? I’ve spend some time googling about yesod-websockets and Network.Websockets (jaspervdj/websockets), but I am having trouble deciding which would be best for my context. Could anyone who has experience with either share some insight?
 Thank you so much!!

 2) open the pdf directly from the citation (I don't quite know how to add pdf links to the citation)

 I often open up org capture to add a journal entry and use it for taking some notes eg during a meeting. For some reason, I seem to sometimes hit undo and lose work or select something to copy/paste and have it overwrite the selection, then have to try to undo the undo and often it's just lost. Probably just need to learn to avoid doing some of these bad habits, but after a way to avoid losing work. Worst part is that I then have to try to remember all the notes I've written and often can't recall them all....which is why I'm doing a capture in the first place.
 Using doom emacs currently with mostly stock configuration, but Evil Mode and vi commands are generally what I'm using.

I know got global variables I could use make-local-variable and kill-local-variable; is there a sort of similar layering functionality for variables that are buffer-local by design or do I need to write my own?
 EDIT: I've done a poor job explaining myself; sorry I was on my phone last night and jotted this down. Let me try to explain:
 I've written a minor-mode for reading that affects some already buffer-local variables, like indicate-empty-lines, or blink-cursor-mode, etc. These are variables that might already have buffer-local values that I want to persist as I'm toggling my minor mode on and off (in my specific case, I want to turn reading-mode on when I enter view-mode, and off when I exit that mode).
 My current implementation can be found in my emacs configuration, but it doesn't work correctly and I feel like there might be a better way built-in to Emacs. Any guidance there would be helpful!

It's just agonizingly slow. 
 Using shell-mode with the same path runs the commands instantly, so it doesn't seem to be a problem with tramp. Is this a known problem with eshell? Is it possible to configure eshell to run remote commands as quickly as using ssh in a terminal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm kind of struggling to understand how closely tied a major mode could or should be to minor modes that provide complementary functionality.
 Basically, I'm working on a major mode that provides font-lock highlighting, indentation rules and keyboard shortcuts for various functionality.
 On top of this, I've so far successfully leveraged two minor modes:- company-mode (auto-completion using a backend provided by the major-mode)- flycheck-mode (a simple flycheck-checker)
 Now to the pickle:
 As an author of the major mode, I've envisioned auto-completion and error reporting and highlighting as integral parts of the mode, yet my understanding is that these are by design orthogonal to major-modes and are opt-in, and users usually enable in hooks if desired.
  
Would it be considered to be bad citizenship to have the major-mode automatically enable these modes?
 How would this actually be done in a sane way? Setting a local company-backend can be done in the define-derived-mode body, and flycheck-define-checker seems to happily register itself, or perhaps an (add-to-list 'flycheckers <checker>) is required, but to actually enable the minor-modes?Sure, it works to just end the mode-body with (company-mode) and (flycheck-mode) but that just feels...wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear haskellers,
 I'm toying with time-series data structures, similar to pandas.DatetimeIndex if you're familiar.
 One thing that I wish I could do was clearly distinguish between unknown frequency, and fixed frequency (e.g. hourly, daily, etc).
 My solution right now is to use phantom types, such as:
 ```haskell import Data.Time (UTCTime) -- from time package newtype Index f = Index [UTCTime]
 data UnknownFreq data Daily
 mkIndex :: [UTCTime] -> Index UnknownFreq
 daily :: UTCTime -> UTCTime -> Index Daily daily start stop = ...
 toDaily :: Index UnknownFreq -> Index Daily toDaily (Index ts) = daily (minimum t) (maximum t) ```
 Then, if I don't export the constructor for Index, it's harder to misuse and have an index which has type frequency Daily, but a real frequency of some other value.
 Another possibility would be to enforce the frequency of the index structurally, e.g.:
 haskell data Frequency = Hourly | Daily data Index = Index { indexStart :: UTCTime , indexStop :: UTCTime , indexFreq :: Frequency } 
 but then how can I also track the frequency a the type-level?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem I am trying to solve is that I have foreign bindings to an external C library that occasionally crashes due to code in the C library beyond my control. I would like to isolate the code that runs in the C library in a child process and restart the child process when it crashses, and I want to continue using the Haskell API we built around it. I would like to fork() the Haskell server process but not call execve(), rather have the child process call into the IO () function that runs the foreign code.
 Unfortunately, the System.Process.CmdSpec data type in the process package doesn't allow you to fork an arbitrary IO function, you MUST provide it a path to an executable as a RawCommand or ShellCommand. I am wondering if there is an easy way to solve my problem without going through the hassle of rolling my own version of System.Process.createProcess using the POSIX APIs in the unix package?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get a grip on creating my own types in haskell. 
 As a starting point I created:
 data Coords = Coords (Int, Int, Int) deriving (Show) instance Eq Coords where (Coords (x,y,z)) == (Coords (x',y',z')) = x==x' && y==y' && z==z' instance Num Coords where (Coords (x,y,z)) + (Coords (x',y',z')) = Coords(x+x', y+y', z+z') (Coords (x,y,z)) - (Coords (x',y',z')) = Coords(x-x', y-y', z-z') (Coords (x,y,z)) * (Coords (x',y',z')) = Coords(x*x', y*y', z*z') negate (Coords (x,y,z)) = Coords (-x,-y,-z) abs (Coords (x,y,z)) = Coords(abs x, abs y, abs z) signum (Coords (x,y,z)) = Coords(signum x, signum y, signum z) fromInteger a = Coords(fromInteger a,fromInteger a,fromInteger a) 
 This enables me to do things like
 Coords (1,2,3) + Coords (4,5,6) 
 To my understanding I would need to create an instance of Functor when I have a function that operates on the 3-tuple but does not know about Coords:
 move n (x,y,z) = (x+n, y+n, z+n) 
 In the hopes I can use it like this:
 move 6 <$> Coords (1,2,3) 
 I created this:
 instance Functor Coords where fmap f (Coords a) = Coords (f a) 
 Upon which the compiler complains: 
 Expected kind '* -> *' but Coords has kind '*' 
 Suppose I define the type like:
 data Coords a = Coords a deriving (Show) 
 Than my functor works but I've no Idea how to implement the instances for Eq and Num
 What am I missing or what am I doing wrong?

 Is there a version with readable function help?
 Otherwise, does someone happen to know what faces I should tweak make the text in the help box readable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The org-parser is an amazing library written by 200ok-ch. I want to share my joy with you about it.
 Certainly, this is not the first org parser out there. What's different, however, is that it's a programmatic parser with a formal specification. Lost? Let me explain. 
 TLDR: it parses a formal grammar of org-mode in its EBN form, and generates a parser!
 What is an EBN form?
 Let's quickly go through what an EBN form is. Roughly, it is a specification of the grammar of grammars! For example, the following is an EBN form for simple math expressions (taken here).
 (setq simple-math-grammar " <S> = VAL | EXPR | PAR PAR = <'('> S <')'> <EXPR> = S OP S VAL = #'[0-9]+' OP = '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' ") 
 With this grammar specification, it's an interesting problem to write a parser generator parser…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, does anyone know a way to expand shell environment variables in the properties drawer?
 Currently I use a tangle-dir funciton that gets a value from the properties drawer and expands it into a path that can be used as target for tangling:
 emacs-lisp (defun tangle-dir (sub-path) "Expand the SUB-PATH into the directory given by the tangle-dir property if that property exists, else use the `default-directory'." ;; (interactive) (expand-file-name sub-path (or (org-entry-get (point) "tangle-dir" 'inherit) (default-directory)))) 
 usage:
 ```org :PROPERTIES: :tangle-dir: dir/subdir :END:
 +begin_src :tangle (tangle-dir "file.txt")
 ...
 +end_src
 ```
 Now I'd like to be able to use shell enviroment variables on :tangle-dir: like :tangle-dir: (getenv "scripts")/subdir or :tangle-dir: $var/subdir.
 Any ideas on how to do this?

 Before this book, I've read the <scala-with-cats> book as well as first 5 chapters of <essential-effects-draft> and first 6 chapters of the red book-<Functional Program in Scala>.
 But when I read to <Practical FP in Scala-A Hands on Approach> page 22, I became difficult to understand the lines like `make[F[_]: Functor: Ref.Make] ` what does the multi-colon here suppose to me. As I skipped this question and goes on, more and more lines baffles me, such as the `===` signature in `if (id === adminUser.id) adminUser.pure[F] `, etc
 I think my foundation is not good to understand this book directly. Where should I turn to before I can read this <Practical FP in Scala-A Hands on Approach> with more ease?

I see that WinGHCi has gotten a lot harder to install in the meantime, and I don't know if students will be able to come to the lab this semester or if we'll still be online, so I'd like to find a free cloud-based solution.
 Repl.it and Coding Rooms have Haskell compilers but not interpreters. I'd like for students to be able to write code in one file/pane and to be able to interact with it in another (i.e., have a read-eval-print loop). We only do fairly simple things in Haskell (such as finding prime numbers) so don't need package management, graphics, etc.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Thinking out loud, hoping maybe someone can give me a good idea.
 So I develop an app with Scala on the backend and a Scala.js (Laminar) frontend, with SBT. Everything about it is great!
 Except compilation times, even incremental. Now, I do everything on my laptop (Thinkpad with OK specs), because I like to use ssh to a FreeBSD VM and use raw Vim, and when the VM is local it doesn't care about network interruptions or a wonky ISP. I like a normal SSH session because of the scroll history, and I like to use i3wm to lay out and manage terminals and using mosh or something would require tmux which I find more awkward.
 If I try out a high-end server just to compare compilation times, it's more than twice as fast. How to take advantage of that?
 Is there something like a distcc for SBT, or another way to leverage remote CPU power? Even if I have to put it in my local network? I guess I could run the build environment on a build server and only expose the sourcecode via NFS or such to the laptop (which should recover after a network interruption), or some edit-over-ssh tool.
 What is everyone else doing?

 I'm trying to step through the code of a lisp function. To simplify this problem, I'm just doing it with a custom hello-world function. I'm looking at these manual pages for guidance:
 Entering the Debugger on a Function Call
 Using the Debugger
 Backtraces
 So, following those pages, I:
 Define the hello world function in my init.el
 ;; This is the ONLY thing in my init.el for now, ;; to try to remove any other possible points of failure. (defun hello-world () (message "Hello world") (interactive)) 
 Open emacs and set a breakpoint on the function
 M-x debug-on-entry Debug on entry to function: hello-world 
 Run the hello world function
 M-x hello-world 
 A Backtrace buffer opens up. It displays
 Debugger entered--entering a function: * hello-world() funcall-interactively(hello-world) call-interactively(hello-world record nil) command-execute(hello-world record) execute-extended-command(nil "hello-world" "hello-world") funcall-interactively(execute-extended-command nil "hello-world" "hello-world") call-interactively(execute-extended-command nil nil) command-execute(execute-extended-command 
 I would expect to run the commands from Backtraces manual page, like 'n' in order to advance to the next line. But I'm getting an 'n is undefined'. What am I missing here exactly?

A lot of the stuff I've been interested in building lately is pretty graph-y. I think it could be nice to have a reusable store for graph like data in emacs. It would make it a lot easier for packages to interop and extend each other if there was a shared data structure underneath.
 Anyway, this is the current, and very early, status of that idea. Would be interested to hear any feedback!

 Is it possible to have properties defined as some function of other properties? For example, is there any way that I could set up something like the following:
 :PROPERTIES: :A: 10 :B: 5 :total: A+B :END: 
 Where the property total, when accessed via things such as the agenda, would evaluate to 15?
 My specific intention here is to create a singular property that is a function of priority, urgency, and impact, giving an overall metric for deciding which tasks to do next.
 Thanks!

 I've just closed the last page of the last chapter of Haskell Programming from First Principles. It took me about 2 months of mostly consistent effort.
 I really liked a lot of the concepts I've grokked from this little adventure; the chapters from monoids through monad transformers in particular showed me a new, very different level of abstraction with which I could think through common programming problems in the future.
 What I haven't done is make any big contributions or study what the job ecosystem looks like yet. Someone just recommended if I wanted to start programming right I should work through this book, and I had a few months of downtime between finishing my degree and starting the job search, so I did it.
 So the only question I have left is: What's next? What would you recommend to someone who just finished this book, but doesn't have any other significant coding experience they can put on their resume?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I have managed to break the 'expected' behaviour of most commands which use -other-window-like behaviour. E.g., dired-other-window, helpful-key or projectile-dired-other-window. If I have one window open, they indeed split the window in two - as expected. However, if I already have two windows open, they end up opening a third window by splitting the current window. The behaviour up until yesterday (...) was that in case of two open windows in the frame, the commands would use the non-current window. 
 I have been going through my config and can't figure out what changed! Any tips from more experienced users will be awesome! I think there is some variable or setting that is playing up.

Hello Everyone, I'm the host of EmacsTalk, a Chinese Podcast focused on Emacs. Beside podcast, I regularly post articles about Emacs tips, again in Chinese. 
 The link above is the English version powered by Google Translate, I think it's good enough for reading, Could anyone with English as native language share some idea about this article? If not readable, I will make some manual corrections based on Google Translate.
 Thanks.

 I found llvm-hs but it has not seen a release for more than two years and depends on an older version of llvm. Work seems to be underway to port it to a more current version.
 Did I miss something? I feel there could be room for a simpler codegen library written in pure Haskell, in addition to big and serious libraries like llvm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the greatest obstacles in switching to Emacs for me is (or rather was) that I have a considerable collection of notes in OneNote, that I rely on quite a bit, and which I'd be sad to loose in the switch. This is my solution to that problem.
 OneWayOut (owo) can export all your OneNote notes to Emacs Org Mode (or any Pandoc-supported Markdown, as of today), and allows you to tailor the results to your best liking by:
  
Giving you complete control over the Pandoc call 
 
Allowing you to post-process the Pandoc output with tailored Markup Packs.
 
 You can see a test OneNote note and its Emacs Org Mode and Pandoc Markdown exports here https://github.com/alopezrivera/owo#results
 Markup Packs are markup-format-specific functions containing search and replace queries executed at runtime against the text output by Pandoc. If search and replace doesn't cut it, you can add a postprocessing scriptblock to increase your freedom. They effectively give you control over how all is rendered, including
 - Headers
 - Metadata (eg: note creation date) 
 - Other markup elements such as horizontal lines, custom indentations and formatting, and whatever else you might be able to conjure up with the text in your notes
 OneWayOut is built on the foundation of ConvertOneNote2Markdown (https://github.com/theohbrothers/ConvertOneNote2Markdown), by SjoerdV (https://github.com/SjoerdV), and improved by nixsee (https://github.com/nixsee/) and theohbrothers (https://github.com/theohbrothers).
 All feedback or suggestions are welcome! Thanks for checking it out :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One minor thing that really annoys me is when I edit a file, do find-file and then the first entry selected is the lock file for the file I just edited. I don't think there's ever a situation where you'd want to open a lock file interactively, but there also isn't a built in way (that I know of) to exclude it from completion because the lock file is of the form .#original-filename. completion-ignored-extensions only works with suffixes so for it to work here you'd need to have the # character or some other at the end of the file name. I just tweaked lock-file-name-transforms to do this but I'm curious why the default format seems to intentionally pick a form we can't easily ignore. Is it just a legacy thing or is there a reason I'm not seeing?

 This build enables native compilation. As it is not compiling all the .el files of Emacs ahead of time as of now, it will compile them as you start using Emacs. I plan to enable ahead of time compilation in the next build (Found that the 28.0.91 has just released, that will be the next build).
 Please give it a try, and let me know how the install/upgrade goes. If you face any issues, comment here or create an issue on the GitLab repository.
 How to install the pretest on Fedora
 ``` sudo dnf copr enable bhavin192/emacs-pretest sudo dnf update emacs 
 or
 sudo dnf install emacs ```
 If you face any other issues, consider reporting them via M-x report-emacs-bug or respective package mailing list / bug tracking system.
 PS: I usually post about these pretest builds on Mastodon: - https://toots.dgplug.org/tags/emacs_pretest - https://toots.dgplug.org/@bhavin192

 The reason seems to be Scala 3's new encoding for lazy vals, where a reflective access to a variable called bitmap takes place. To demonstrate this, I took the http4s g8 template, set it up with Scala 3.1.0, added sbt native-image, started the nativeImageRunAgent and ran a single request against GET /joke. After stopping the server, the native-image run agent generated the reflective configs that are required for this path of execution. Comparing the generated Scala 2.13 with the Scala 3 configs yields a bloated version for Scala 3 that contains these additional rules:
 { "name":"org.http4s.Header$Raw$", "fields":[{"name":"0bitmap$1"}]} , { "name…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm going through i-am-tom's Haskell exercises, currently I'm doing "06-TypeFamilies", and I'm not getting the answer to question two to go through the type checker. The problem description is:
  
Write a 'flatMap' function that takes a `Vector n a`, and a function`a -> Vector m b`, and produces a list that is the concatenation of these results.
  
What we have is:
 data Nat = Z | S Nat data Vector (count :: Nat) (a :: Type) where VNil :: Vector 'Z a VCons :: a -> Vector n a -> Vector ('S n) a type family (x :: Nat) + (y :: Nat) :: Nat where 'Z + y = y ('S x) + y = 'S (x + y) type family (x :: Nat) ** (y :: Nat) :: Nat where 'Z ** y = 'Z ('S x) ** y = y + x ** y append :: Vector m a -> Vector n a -> Vector (m + n) a append VNil ys = ys append (VCons x xs) ys = VCons x (append xs ys) 
 The definition of flatMap that I came up with (and that is also in the answers branch of the repository) is:
 flatMap :: Vector n a -> (a -> Vector m b) -> Vector (n ** m) b flatMap VNil _ = VNil flatMap (VCons x xs) f = append (f x) (flatMap xs f) 
 This gives a type error though:
 Could not deduce: (m + (n1 ** m)) ~ ((m + n1) ** m) from the context: n ~ 'S n1 bound by a pattern with constructor: VCons :: forall a (n :: Nat). a -> Vector n a -> Vector ('S n) a, in an equation for ‘flatMap’ 
 I'm running ghc 8.10.7 for this. Any idea of what is wrong?

Viewing the files 


You are still able to edit individual files while in this combined view.

And you can also rearrange the order of the files and have this reflected in the combined view.

This function seems incredibly useful for arranging and editing a final piece of writing.
Is there any plain text editor/viewer that is able to give the same functionality?
The ability to rearrange the order of the files could be replicated by placing then editing number at the start of the file, though this would be cumbersome to do manually. It would be great if a piece of software could automatically edit numbers in at the start of the file name as individual files are rearranged, but this might be asking too much.
Is any software able to show multiple notes in a "Scrivenings" like view?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl,dr
I'm looking for an objective(-ish) measure of the one-thought-only measures. Any ideas?
a small background:
Recently, I have been getting into learning programming, and I stumbled into Uncle Bob's lectures on clean coding (available on youtube, as of now). In there he outlines that there is this principle that a good function, is a function that does one thing, and does it well.
However the one thing was up for interpretation. (for example It used to be a fuction that can fit into a screen. which is not really that well of a measure). He goes on to say that they came up with a good objective measure:  a function that no one can meaningfully extract another function from.
It seems like a very well solution for a definition problem.
The need for "one thought"
The same sort of definition problem is also present in the case of a zettel. Although assuming one thought per zettel might not be essential nor desireable for every type of zettelkasten, it can be useful for some, in order to make a synthesis of an unstructured body of knowledge and emerge with a structure.
For example, I might be trying to understand a school of though, this school may be offering argument A as a an argument for their belief.  However, argument A is made up of 5 parts, each part can be argued against, in seperate ways, and the arguments against may be challenged in different ways and so on. One might try to gather arguements againts and try to categorize them, summerize them, and essentially refactor them.  In this situation, if each zettel only contain one and only one thought, it would be much more of an elegant workflow to put them against each other.
The need for objectivity
An objective measure, can be extremely useful, in order to maintain the flow, and unload a cognitive load of "is it too big or too small?" 
The matter
What are your thoughts on this matter?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was trying to install a haskell code formatter to make sure my xmomad config looks nice. I installed stylish-haskell with cabal, since my system doesn't package it in its repos. I tried it, it didn't format the code how I wanted it to, so I thought "that's fine, I'll just uninstall it and try another formatter".
 Long story short, apparently I can't. I tried to find out why, and apparently the best excuse is "cabal isn't a package manager". Ok, so what the fuck am I meant to use to manage packages? Stack can't uninstall either. 
 Every github issue asking for uninstall functions is seemingly shut down with a response like "I can't really see the use case for this". Like what? What if you just don't want the fucking package anymore? That's like not adding brakes to a car because you "don't see the use case, the point of a car is to go fast".
 Why does a language like haskell not have a proper package manager? How do you live like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 Do you guys autoload your own defined functions (not third-party) in your init file (or files)?. For functions which will potentially be used in multiple packages, using (with-)eval-after-load to defer their loading wouldn't really work, would it?
 What's your setup for this? I can only think of putting them all in the same file(s), generating the autoloads file for it (with update-file-autoloads), and then loading the generated file instead of the original. The problem with this is that it would then load all the functions in the file instead of only the requested one, wouldn't it? Also, I like to keep code tidy and those functions definitions make more sense if they are somewhere else in the code.
 Maybe I'm over-engineering my config. I was just wondering what would be the most optimal approach for this and what are you guys doing with your configs.
 Thanks a lot in advance!
 EDIT: I've specified more that I'm talking about my own defined code, not installed packages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My newest blog article on the danger of having relevant information locked away in video/audio/images only is not directly on-topic for GNU/Emacs. However, I do think that this will resonate well with the community here since we all probably have experienced similar situations where people did reject text-based information or tools just because of their aesthetics.
 We should be aware of this lock-in situation based on information format. With my article, you may have a go-to to send out for rising the awareness in peers.
 Maybe you know some positive examples and want to share them in the comments below?
 I once read about a research department(?) in the early eighties where secretaries were using GNU/Emacs and even creating lots of Elisp functions "just because nobody told them that this is actual programming. They just did this because this made their life easier." (paraphrased from my memory).
 So, is there a good story you know where non-tech-savvy people were using "nerdy" tools like GNU/Emacs? 
 Ceterum autem censeo don't contribute anything relevant in web forums like Reddit only

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Story time. After many years of struggle, around a year ago, I finally had my eureka moment and eventually felt comfortable using Haskell in production. In the non-fp realm, I am a tech lead with a good amount of exp & industrial perspective. I'm still learning a lot in FP/Haskell (with the more advanced topics).
 As Erik, one of my favorite teacher used to say, "you don't understand it deep enough until you start teaching it". At the risk of being a cliché, I'm, ehem, starting a youtube channel:
 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiaFQ7p683Dr-oXMdUGRLHA/videos
 The main idea of this channel is to teach FP/Haskell by analogy instead of first principle. I know it's controversial but I think this will help bring down the barrier to entry to the eco system. I believe in the idea of "know one teach one" and hope to get rid of the uncontrolled side effects in the world, one function at a time. I plan to upload every 2 weeks or so at this stage.
 I'm writing this to look for some initial help, particularly in the following areas.
  
I'm looking for people who comes from mainstream (non FP) language and are currently struggling with FP/Haskell to preview and/or suggest contents to ensure developer friendliness.
 I'm looking for people who uses FP in production and have a deep understanding of the topic to yell at me (in private) to ensure that I don't say the wrong thing and leading people down the wrong paths.
  
I'm after a handful of allies to start a micro community/learning group over email or discord. If this interests you, please drop me a comment here and/or send me a PM, specifying which group above you'd consider yourself to be in (newcomers or veterans), and I'll follow up.
 Toward a functional world!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those of you who use VS Code and are interested in using Tailwind CSS in Haskell using Lucid I have figured out how to get the Tailwind extension working so that you get autocomplete and info tooltips. Here is a screenshot:
 https://imgur.com/a/EeN4vW9
 I would say that autocomplete is essential when authoring HTML with Tailwind because otherwise you have to keep referring to the cheat sheet, and if you make a typo or attempt a sizing that doesn't exist then there is no type safety to tell you.
 And info hovers are also useful for reading code because it shows you the actual CSS for each class (otherwise you again have to refer to the cheat sheet all the time or memorize all of the tailwind classes).
 Instructions:
 First install the tailwind extension for VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss
 Then you will need to create a tailwind.config.js file. You can use this:
 module.exports = { content: ["./src/**/*.hs"], theme: { extend: {}, }, plugins: [], }; 
 In order for the VS Code extension to work, it seems that it needs a local/project install of tailwind and postcss, so you can run this:
 $ npm init $ npm install tailwindcss $ npm install postcss 
 Finally, the crucial step: in your VS Code settings.json add these two settings to configure the extension:
  "tailwindCSS.includeLanguages": { "haskell": "html" }, "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [ "class_ \"([^\"]*)" ], 
 I believe that the above regex should also work if you are using blaze-html instead of Lucid (but I have not tested it).
 Good luck! 
 Btw, here is an additional repo I found with info on Tailwind CSS in Haskell: https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk-tailwind-example

 It took a few tries but eventually the right way was to use GHCup on Ubuntu 21.10. Neovim + coc.nvim works, using the haskell-language-server as a back-end, and so does VSCode with remote ssh.
 cabal works. stack didn't (resource exhausted (No space left on device)), but stack seems to be a bit too much for a RPI on an SD card. 
 Of course it's not blazingly fast but I stubbornly wanted to get it up and running, and I did.
 I just felt like telling someone :-)

        <updated>2022-01-08T06:36:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a fan of Cal Newport's work. He also seems to frequently produce high quality work (multiple best-selling books, consistent blog posts, articles for good publications, and a large number of academic papers).
In a recent podcast episode, Cal Newport made a distinction between proactive and reactive methods of information management.
Proactive information management attempts to takes information when first encountered and put it into some sort of knowledge management system (such as a Zettelkasten), maybe even before there is a specific "need" for it.  This information can then be retrieved at a later date, and new potentially novel connections can form between the information in the system.
He states his method of working is more reactive and project based, citing the overhead of inputting information to and maintaining such systems.
Reactive information management seems to be more on-demand and project based. When you are working on a particular project, you go out and find sources relevant to that article.
He also mentioned that over time (if you write enough) you will have been exposed to a lot of interesting ideas, and often when working on a project, a few potential starting points will come to mind which then you can follow to more relevant citations.
https://overcast.fm/+b1V0JshqM/34:55
One question when using a reactive project based method is what projects to work on? This is where I can see the value of novel connections in a Zetellkasten in generating ideas.
I'm curious what peoples' thoughts on this are?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am following the system crafter org roam tutorial and going through the video step by step on my linux system. This is the org roam code that I have thus far:
 use-package org-roam :ensure t :custom (org-roam-directory "~/RoamNotes") :bind (("C-c n l" . org-roam-buffer-toggle) ("C-c n f" . org-roam-node-find) ("C-c n i" . org-roam-node-insert)) :config (org-roam-setup)) 
 When I press C-c n f , it asks for the Node which I name and press enter. But no capture window appears for me which appeared for system crafters in the tutorial. I did notice that it is created as a buffer so I move to it and save it but it doesn't seem to be a org roam file since I don't see and ID or Property tags at the beginning:

 I also noticed that I have the following org-collect-keywords issue in my messages buffer:

 So I am wondering exactly how to fix this issue and get the same results as in the tutorial?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've been tweaking my multiple-cursors configuration a bit and want to use the <return> key to insert a newline (because I can never remember that I need to use <C-j> in multiple-cursors-mode.
 The documented solution is to set (define-key mc/keymap (kbd "<return>") nil). Running this command manually in my Emacs results in the desired behavior, but not when I add it to my init.el with use-package.
 I tried these two approaches:
  (use-package multiple-cursors :config (define-key mc/keymap (kbd "<return>") nil)) 
  (use-package multiple-cursors :bind ( :map mc/keymap ("<return>" . nil))) 
 In both cases, I get no errors / warnings when loading my init.el, but multiple-cursors-mode simply gets disabled when pressing <return>.
 Does anyone else have a similar setup or an idea how this can work?

 I'm a Vim user who loves the look of Org mode. This video has made me want to drop everything and learn it. However right now, I don't have the time to dedicate to learning Emacs at the moment, so I've become interested in the idea of just using it for Org mode and nothing else. My question is, if I don't care about any features of Emacs other than Org mode, what's the simplest way I can go about using it with Vim's navigation keys/modes?
 (I am aware there are a few different plugins for Vim/Neovim which attempt to emulate Org mode, but I've heard none of them come close to real Org mode)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a few weeks back I found spacemacs. Downloaded it and started to play with it. I realised quickly if I want to go down this rabbit hole I want to understand how emacs works. So I started reading and watching the excellent "System Crafters" video series with Emacs from scratch. I created my own init.el instead of spacemancs and today I created my first theme for Emacs (only graphical mode and alot is still missing).
 I feel that right now I spend more time configuring Emacs than actually using it (even if all configiration happends within emacs).
 I am also so happy that HaikuOS got its first fully native and functional emacs port. (also one of the reasons that I am trying to switch to emacs is that I can use it with the same look and feel and keybindings on every machine).
 The theme is based on catppuccin color scheme (using autothemer). Any suggestion of improvements?
 My config and theme can be found here. Dont judge my config, I've only used emacs for a few weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 For a couple of days, I've been trying to keybind SPC-SPC (now find-file or project-find-file) to a bottom popup that would display easy navigation to my files.
 Here's the simple popup code (works perfectly and gets activated upon "SPC e")
 (map! :leader (:prefix ("e" . "open config files") :desc "alacritty.yml" "a" #'(lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml")) :desc "nvim" "n" #'(lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/.config/nvim/init.vim")) :desc "polybar" "p" #'(lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/.config/polybar/config"))) 
 But I'd like to use "SPC SPC" instead of "SPC e". When I change :prefix from "e" to "SPC", I get: "Key sequence SPC starts with non-prefix key SPC. Is there a way to bind "SPC SPC" to a similar navigation?
 I managed to get "SPC SPC" execute "my-own-nav-function" (or any other function... see the code below), but then I'm stuck on a function definition.
 (map! :leader :desc "navigation function" "SPC" #'my-own-nav-function) 
 Can somebody help me please?
 Many thanks

This time, it's a real-world journey through realizing a project task that included error-prone screenshot and snippet creation to replace embedded Twitter HTML snippets with images + links (decentralize!). I tried to find a sweet-spot for semi-automating the task to make it as smooth as possible for me to replace the 85 snippets without going crazy or introduce too much errors.
 This should not be great news to anybody who is familiar with babel and shell scripts. For people who don't use either of them, it is probably a good use-case description how I'm using Org-mode to supplement generic tasks.

 I'm sorry if that is a recurrent question, but most answers I find seem to be out of date, especially after the release of the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2. I use Emacs with the Doom Emacs distribution on Linux (this is not set in stone, I can use Emacs without Doom if necessary), but I'm not a programmer or IT professional, so I'd like to get some opinions on how to best to install it on Windows 10, in such a way that I get an experience that is similar to what I get on Linux.
 Any suggestions? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently become involved in some qualitative research that involves using the program NVivo to analyse interview transcripts. Basically, the interview transcript is imported into NVivo, then you go read each sentence and attached thematic tag(s).
I think this would be an interesting way to organise research and notes, with the understanding that the tagging system would evolve over time.
For example,
If you are working on a specific article, you could browse through previous semi-related tags and tag sentences that might be relevant to that article.
Or if you are working on a longer project, tags could start general but then over time be refined and become more specific as you work out the structure of the project.
The only way I can think to implement something like this in existing note taking apps is to have one sentence per note, then as many required tags per note, but this seems unmanageable.
I'm curious what other think of this idea?]]></summary>

 Is there a good solution to this (besides being restricted to only one Emacs instance, or being careful)?
 I could imagine a package, which handles the bookmarks via an sqlite database. Or some elisp, which checks the bookmarks file regarding changes before writing to it.

using custom-set-faces on the theme and saving them to init file (comment to the above link answer)
 
 Both seem not clean / tidy. I would like smng like color-theme-install-frame-params here https://superuser.com/a/482031, but it's custon function only for color theme.
 Is there a good way to do it?

 Does anyone faced this problem and found solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to capture have a capture for a future meeting. I need two time-stamps for my ideal work-flow. 
 (1) A time-stamp in the headline or as part of a date-tree so that I can review my meetings (and the notes I took during the meeting) in chronological order. Really the big reason for this time-stamp is so that, when I am searching for meetings using consult-org-agenda I can distringuish multiple meetings all with headline "meeting with person X". 
 (2) I also need an active time-stamp so the meeting show ups in my agenda on the correct day. 
 These timestamps should be identical and should be set by prompting for a date during capture. 
 ​
 I would very much appreciate ideas on how to do this. I have seen the :time-promp option in the org-manual but not sure how to syncronize that with an active time-stamp (e.g., how to not be prompted for the date twice). Alternatively, if anyone has a better workflow or better idea I am very open to that as well. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Recently, I came up of an idea that we can practice natural language (for me, it's English) speaking using subtitle files, as they already have timestamps along with subtitle texts, so that we can loop over specific parts of a video file easily by taking advantage of those timestamps, instead of setting the start time and end time of the playback manually and then looping over it.
 And then I thought of a package, subed, which jumped into my eyes when I was wandering around Sacha Chua's blog (kudos to @sachac). And I found it was perfect for this idea after playing with it for ~10 minutes.
 Here are the steps: 1. Open a subtitle file, say foo.srt, subed will automatically open the accompany video file having the name foo.mp4/foo.mk4/foo.avi etc using mpv. 2. Then in the subtitle buffer, only these three key bindings will do the job: 1. C-c C-l toggles looping over the current subtitle By default, there is an extra second before and after the time span, as specified in the config subed-loop-seconds-before & subed-loop-seconds-after. 2. M-n moves the point to the next subtitle, and it automatically seek the playback to the corresponding timeline. 3. M-p moves the point to the previous subtitle and seek the playback to the right position of the timeline.
 Although the package is designed to be used to edit subtitles efficiently, it could also shine in language speaking/shadowing.
 If you're also learning foreign languages, I believe this workflow can help you.✌

 I'm using emacs daily and mostly. Only thing left is emails and my carddav/caldav data which is hosted on a self hosted nextcloud instance. I setup emails and it worked perfectly but without carddav data it's useless for me. I need to see/add contact data from emails. In addition to that I tried to sync my caldav data but it wasn't good enough to keep my workflow. I tried org-caldav btw. Anyone have good experience on these before?

 I was hoping that Emacs would finally support coloured emojis on Windows. However, when I compile Emacs myself off of master (29.0.5), with cairo installed using ming/pacman, and the --with-cairo flag set the ./configure output still shows that Emacs can't detect cairo (or can't use it in Windows). I'm curious if anyone else has figured out how to get Emacs to render color emojis on Windows or if that's something that's not supported yet?
 Maybe I'll be blessed an /u/eli-zaretskii can weight in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I see that Lightbend is investing heavily in Akka (and Akka Serverless). I also noticed the hype around Akka for .Net. However, my experience with Akka has been one of a somewhat struggle and I am curious to know if things have changed in the last few years.
 My (only) attempt with Akka was 3-4 years ago when I wrote a web-service based on it. I remember how some things that would have been trivial if carried out with Future/Cats-effect/ZIO required quite a lot of coding in Akka. Two examples that I can think of:
 Concurrent requests:
 Some requests to the service required gathering information from several different actors asynchronously before returning a response. This required me to follow the "Aggregator Pattern": Sending the requests to the relevant actors and then changing context to accumulate (and keep track of) the responses . If I wanted to add an optional timeout I also had to set a timer with a Timeout message and cancel it once all responses arrived. It felt to me like this could have been more easily carried out with a Future.sequence(...) (if timeout is not necessary) or with parTraverse(...)/foreachPar(...) (Cats-effect/ZIO) with an optional .timeout(...) setting.
 Asynchronous execution:
 I many cases I found out that some synchronous tasks took longer than I initially thought, hurting my actor's responsiveness. However - if I decided to make those tasks asynchronous I had to write a new actor specifically for them. Compare this with wrapping a synchronous piece of code with a Future/IO/ZIO and it seems like a lot of boiler-plate for a relatively-simple refactor.
 What's common to both of those cases is the sense that I had to personally take care of behaviors that could/should have been abstracted away for me... 
 I was wondering if programming in Akka still feels so low-level...

 I like Agda, but i'm not ready to wrap all browser features myself yet. Haskell or Idris don't seem to have easy to start web-app ecosystem, either. I was told that Elm doesn't have anything (?) for that beyond accessing js API, which i'm trying to avoid. As js-first and fairly mature language, i wonder if PureScript is a good choice?
 PS: i have basic js knowledge, but have a strong distaste for it and lack substantial for-browser coding. I tried PureScript a while ago, but didn't go beyond toying around, so i know i'm fine with the language, the question is only about environment/libs

 The conference is being organised in collaboration with Juspay and HasGeek, and will feature a full day of great talks by invited speakers! It will be held entirely online, and all the talks will (eventually) be made available for free access.
 The schedule is still being put together, and we'll release more details in the coming weeks. Please follow the PureConf conference page for updates.
 The conference is very modestly priced at 99 INR, or about 1.3 USD. While we have to charge a ticket price for various reasons, we have kept the ticket price very low to keep it accessible for everyone.
 Please feel free to contact me [ajnsit at google's email service] for any questions / feedback!
 See you all there!

 I am using monotropic theme and it makes modeline invisible (white) for non active buffers, i like it but would like to make small adjustment - to make modified element visible.
 I can easily do that for buffer id
 (custom-theme-set-faces
 'monotropic
 '(mode-line-buffer-id ((t (:foreground "#111111"))))
 )
 But it does not work for mode-line-modified, seems like cause it's not the face...
 I also learnt that i can specifically set color only for non active buffer situation, with :distant-foreground, but my problem is how to "select" modified element... Do i need to define it somehow to be able to select it?

 I find myself writing more C/C++ with Emacs, the experience is good overall but it's a bit of a pain to write the documentation by hand, I'm wondering how everyone else is doing it?
 Is there a way to autogen doxygen doc for C/C++? At least templates with the parameters types and return type? I do this with tide in Emacs with Typescript for example and it's pretty useful. 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Effect systems like Polysemy provide the programmer with a flexible way to keep the business logic of a program as
flexible as possible by separating the definition of effects and their interpretation.
This is useful for many reasons, but especially for testing and mocking.
For example, instead of using an interpreter that runs a task over the network, one can swap it for an in-memory

To achieve this goal, effects should clearly convey functionality without exposing their implementation.
In many cases, this means exposing interpreters involving low-level constructs, such as IO, StateT or exceptions, only at the
outermost levels of the application.
However, for some kinds of effects, it can be hard to design an ex…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: After disabling the ligatures module in my doom emacs config altogether, turns out everything runs smooth again. While the auto-composition-mode is no longer guilty, my problem is still that ligatures have a very bad performance. I guess ligatures having bad performance in emacs are known, because they're mentioned in the doom FAQ.
 I recently installed emacs (doom) on a new manjaro installation and since I started using it I've been noticing that moving on a buffer and inserting text feels very laggy, and after a couple of minutes that becomes increasingly noticeable to the point where it's really hard to type, taking up to a couple of seconds to see the input being written on the screen.
 So I decided to investigate further into this, and tried disabling minor modes one by one, until I noticed the problem went away when I disabled the auto-composition-mode. I repeated the experiment disabling only that mode, just to be sure it wasn't because of some other mode that I failed to notice.
 I was wondering if there's something I could do about the performance of this mode. I know I could just disable it globally, but I would like to keep it enabled so the ligatures don't go away. I am using Fira Code.
 I'm using Emacs 29.0.5 (installed through the package emacs-git on AUR), with Harfbuzz.
 All help is very appreciated. Let me know if you need any more info.

 myLength [] = 0 myLength (x:xs) | xs == [] = 1 | otherwise = 1 + myLength xs

 Adding to the code works. But then my own guess at writing my own definition didn't work, namely,
 myLength :: [a] -> Int 
 saying
 No instance for (Eq a) arising from a use of ‘==’ Possible fix: add (Eq a) to the context of the type signature for: myLength :: forall a. [a] -> Int 
 But if I change my code to
 myLength [] = 0 myLength (x:xs) | null xs = 1 | otherwise = 1 + myLength xs 
 myLength :: [a] -> Int seems to work. What under the hood is going on here? null has the type definition null :: Foldable t => t a -> Bool How does that change the situation, making my supposedly wrong definition right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm making a game engine right now, and something I'm considering is a scripting system which is relatively isolated from the rest of the game. I was considering creating something like a sandboxed form of IO, but the fact that unsafePerformIO exists the level of isolation I want is not really feasible. I'd definitely appreciate if I could, say, dynamically compile and link these scripts for maximum performance, and have the scripting language just be Haskell. A core principal of this engine is that you may have multiple instances of a game being managed by the same process (for example, a server and client being run simultaneously, multiple servers, some of which might have different scripts, etc). A script could contain anything from a map file to a custom game mode, to say, admin commands, and I want these to have as much isolation from raw IO as I can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: it seems that there is no simple way how to check for changes not staged for commit and untracked files with Magit with use of elisp command (outside of the Magit GUI).
 Hi,
 I've made this simple function to commit and push all changes within some particular git repository from emacs, but there is a problem in case I run it twice (or when there is nothing to commit), because then there is nothing to commit, git-commit returns 1 which is treated as an error. It's not really an issue, but if that happens, I don't know if some real error happened or if it's just this.
 So I am wondering if somebody knows of any way how I could check if there are any changes to commit (whether there is any way of asking magit if there are any changes in git repository), so that I could run the commands only when there are some changes to commit.
 Code:
 (defun gitsync() "synces git repository" (interactive) (message "Synchronizing git repository...") (let ((default-directory "/path/to/git/repo/")) (magit-call-git "add" "-A" ".") (magit-call-git "commit" "-a" "-m" "\"commit msg\"") (magit-call-git "push")) (message "Synchronizing git repository... done")) 
 Edit: clarification

  main = do num <- getLine let number = read num in putStrLn $ "Successor of the number is " ++ show (number+1) 
 It is compiling perfectly

It started like this: The timestamp format 202201041342 is hard-wired into The Archive. I find 220104-1342 to be easier to grasp (as well as shorter). There are probably almost as many preferences for how to format an ID as there are users. It seems to me that a default ID option field,  perhaps using date tokens, would fit quite naturally into Advanced Prefs, and could make a lot of users happy.]]></summary>

 This here is what I've done, as you can see, but I'm a newb and I'm not sure if this is correct, but it seems to work for me, so I'm just looking for some confirmation, or correction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, before my cake day on reddit, I was writing my Ph.D. thesis using LaTeX and Emacs as editor. One of my most common writing mistakes was to repetitively use words (say, word x appearing more than once in a 100 word radius, where it can be avoided). Looking for automated detection tools, I noticed a lack thereof, so I wrote my own (teaching myself elisp in the process). Just stumbled upon it today again and thought it might be of interest in r/emacs. https://github.com/ioah86/repetition_error_finder
 There are likely some bugs, but I hope people will find it useful as I did back then. Have fun 😀

 Have you tried browsing web using a keyboard? If you haven't yet, I suggest you give it a try. This idea is implemented as a plugin for all the major browsers. For Emacs, you can use emacs-webkit.

 But what I actually want is  [[1,2,3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[1],[2],[3],[]]  How can I do a filter (not null) allComboos?

 The other day I merged an extension to integrate dtache with consult. The dtache is the package for detachable shell commands. The functionality is opt in, and provided through the dtache-consult.el. 
 This allows users of consult to conveniently narrow the list of dtache sessions. For an overview of the functionality see https://niklaseklund.gitlab.io/blog/posts/dtache_consult/
 Credit should also be given to minad who provided feedback on the implementation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After reading https://graphitemaster.github.io/aau/ I'm feeling that using signed integers in Haskell makes even less sense than in imperative languages, but unsigned integers (Words) are almost never used. It feels strange for correctness oriented language. I've looked at functions in Data.List and 4 out of 5 functions taking integer parameters (replicate, take, drop, splitAt) are actually doing n' = max n 0 with their argument, and only one ((!!)) throws an error with negative argument. In Data.Vector a ton of functions is taking integer parameters, and I've checked only the analogs of functions from Data.List and they behave the same (indexing throws, while other functions have this "wrap to 0" behavior for negative values).
 Isn't it sweeping problems under the rug? Does this convention have other reason than historical one?
 On the related issue: what is the underflow and overflow semantics in (GHC) Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, The more I play the guitar again, and the more I recognise about Emacs, org-mode and roam, and the more ideas I get.... Along with the more questions ... Jens Larsen is a very popular jazz guitarist, and pedagogue, he has recorded hundreds of videos available on his website and on Youtube, all with the material to learn or perfect your jazz art on the guitar. My idea would be to retrieve the names of the videos with the links (this should be possible by fiddling with the developer mode of Firefox on the page where he sums up the videos he already shared). Then I would ‏‏‎ like to create one note per title: - the name of the video becomes the file name - the note only contains a property #+Link: with link. Given that there are more than 800 videos, I would like to automate the process, but I do not know how to proceed. Could you please show me the way, and tell me how to create a script/macro in order to do it? I have started taking notes about my newly starting journey with the jazz guitar in org-roam, and I would like to be able to link my notes to the videos, and to search with deft. Any improvement /suggestions on the workflow is welcome! Thanks in advance for your help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phrasing a descriptive title was hard.
 I use ChkTeX as a flymake backend for checking my (La)TeX documents. ChkTeX is good, but sometimes gets things wrong (or makes suggestions which are not appropriate). Recognising this, it also reads a config file, and recognises certain magic comments, which can ignore warnings, or define new warning rules (it's a really amazing tool, check it out if you write TeX!).
 I recently had to write quite a few such magic comments, all in the same format, for ignoring different warnings (the comments are all very similar, just with a different diagnostic number in each). This quickly got boring, and this kind of programmatic text manipulation is exactly what emacs is good for. So I was about to write a set of functions like chktex-ignore-warning-at-pt and chktex-ignore-warning-at-pt-global (for writing to the config file).
 But then I thought that I can't be the first person to want to do this, and stuff like this (interacting with error information in configurable ways) surely can't be restricted to TeX. I thought there might something like a flymake-ignore-error-function variable, which I could set to my function, and there would be lots of flymake infrastructure for this -- but there isn't. Is there any such infrastructure already in emacs for interacting with errors in this way (ignoring, ignoring globally, finding docs etc. Of course, the specifics would have to be implemented in each specific backend)? I'm asking mostly because -- though it would be easy for me to just write my own functions and forget about it -- it seems like a useful general capability and if it doesn't exist yet, maybe it should? Would appreciate any thoughts.
 TIA.

But if you are at the beginning of the invisible region - just before the ellipsis - then it happily deletes the invisible text.
 Also when you delete all newlines after the header, so the following text should be added to the header, it does get added to the header... but as a new invisible region. That ellipsis can't be expanded with <tab> for some reason.
 Adding new characters from the start of the invisible region is correctly prevented.
 I tried searching emacs' issue tracker but it either gives me unhelpful errors or just doesn't do anything so I'm trying here instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Emacs 27, and I'm using packages to load packages and customize to configure. How do I set up init.el so that Emacs will load a theme that is needed first, but then configure properly afterward?
 My example: Starting from scratch, I want to load monokai-theme from melpa and set it:
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t) (custom-set-variables '(custom-enabled-themes '(monokai)) '(custom-safe-themes '("d9646b131c4aa37f01f909fbdd5a9099389518eb68f25277ed19ba99adeb7279" default)) '(package-selected-packages '(monokai-theme))) (custom-set-faces ) 
 If monokai-theme is already downloaded, this works fine. But I want to have emacs download the package automatically if not already present. I use the following block:
 (when (not package-archive-contents) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install-selected-packages) ) 
 If I add this below the customize variables, it installs monokai-theme but doesn't load it. I need to restart emacs. If I add this above the customize variables, it doesn't work because package-selected-packages is not loaded yet.
 There's a catch-22 here since each piece needs the other to run first.
 I want to see if I can configure most things in customize, but maybe customize is not right for this job? Should I be using customize at all?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.2.0.
 What is Iron ?
 Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.
 Here is a simple example: ```scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.log)
 log(-1d) //Compile-time error ```
 Features of 1.2.0
 Release 1.2.0 brings two key features: an imperative-styled DSL and constraints relations/consequences.
 Imperative DSL
 Iron brings a new imperative-styled DSL directly inspired by Martin Odersky's Representing Monad with Capabilities (HOPE 2021).
 Here is the "imperative" form of our log(x) method presented above: scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Raw[Double] = refined { Math.log(x) }  In this example, x is automatically unboxed via an implicit conversion only available inside refined and Math.log(x) is automatically boxed into a new Constrained.
 Capabilities work for other kind of monads. If you want to use capabilities in your project, I highly suggest you to watch the talk linked above.
 Consequences
 A consequence has basically a definition analoguous to logical implication => (do not confuse it with Scala's functions). It is used to convert a Constrained value to another Constrained.
 While a default implementation exists for all conversions, this new typeclass allows you to define specific relations (like transitivity, reflexivity etc...) that have two major benefits: - Check some conversions at compile-time where (for example, we know that a constrained value A / B can't be converted to A / Not[B]). - Avoid unnecessary evaluations at runtime.
 Note that Consequences are not exclusive to mathematical/numerical values.
 That's all for this release. For further information, check the release on Github.
 Happy new year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a mode to edit ics files in Emacs? I know I can open them as text files and edit them, but I am looking for a more convenient way that respects the structure and standard of an ics file and make inputting dates and times more human friendly.
 Perhaps in some form that resembles Google's event editor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I use counsel-rg, I get results back that reflect searching files on my filesystem that do not reflect changes made to open buffers. So if I search for something, I'll get results back that might be in the wrong position, or referring to lines I may have deleted, etc. 
 Is there any way I can customize any project-wide swiper search like counsel-rg to search all files in a project, but prioritize open buffers over persistent files? Preferably without using projectile.

 I miss some of its features. That's why I would like to compile it from source. I know a lot of you guys do this: which is your criteria to chose a branch or tag from which to compile, from the Emacs repo? (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/tree/master)
 I want to use the latest more or less stable version possible, not the most bleeding edge one possible. Since I don't want to potentially run into errors on a daily basis or anything like that.
 Should I go for the latest tag possible, i.e. emacs-28.0.90? If I understand correctly, tags are meant to indicate each latest stable version, don't they? Or should I go for the HEAD of any specific branch?
 Thanks a lot in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things that amazes me about Haskell is the rabbit holes I'm ceaselessly cascading down. For example, what I thought was an innocent question turned out to be my latest rabbit hole, i.e. apparently Haskell doesn't have real recursive types. Apparently, what I thought was a recursive type, e.g.
 data Peano = Zero | Succ Peano 
 is not really a recursive type, although I'm not sure why. My previous question about what turned out to be the omega combinator brought up the true nature of Haskell recursive types and the mysterious newtype "workaround". So this talks about a real natural number recursive type (as does my previous question)
 MyNat = One :+: MyNat 
 MyList a = One :+: (a :*: MyList a)
 I can't truly fathom what's being done/said here, e.g., no idea what is meant first paragraph in by a typed tagless-final interpreter. Simple blind acceptance, which is just hand-waving, isn't my style. And the logic programming course it references is, well, my latest rabbit hole. Can somebody give me some intro material to this whole issue of what really is a recursive type. This all started, BTW, with trying to understand what a type equation meant. Can you guess how many pdfs and web pages I've opened since then? Fazit: Somebody (me?) needs to pull all these threads together into one big Haskell-Omni textbook. The existing beginner texts are too handwavy, IMHO. There's a kiddie version of Haskell and a grownup's version. The kiddie version is pretty much useless, again, IMHO, unless it's to spur you on to the bigger stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using the result of another code block i find i want to transform the value slightly before using it, in particular I want to trim off a newline. I have a feeling this ought to be a common case, but I can't find any information on how to do it.
 For instance, in something like this, where bar refers to another (named) block and thus has a trailing newline.
 ```
 +header: :var foo=bar
 +begin_src http :pretty
 POST http://localhost:3000/api/${too}/run
 +end_src

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This change appears to have happened around September 2021. I could not find any official announcement, but I could have missed it.
 This just cost me fiveten minutes of my life (only because I have gotten used to it, having been broken multiple times now from main branch renames in various projects).
 I am here to complain and perhaps save some time for anyone else who contributes to Org mode or uses the source occasionally.
 If you're still tracking master, you're missing commits.

 (λx . xx)(λx . xx)

 (λx . xxx)(λx . xxx)(λx . xxx) 
 How could they be done as Haskell anonymous functions? I've got this in a similar vein perhaps
 let x = a in let y = λz.x in let x = b in y x 
 But I've mixed in the parts I can't fathom in Haskell, i.e., the λz.x and y x This isn't it (\x -> \x -> x)
 which is, if I'm not mistaken (λxx . x); it just takes two inputs and returns the second; and this doesn't seem to be allowed (\x -> x x) so I'm stuck.

Semantically this makes perfect sense; it is exactly what I want to do. However, my agenda for the day doesn't distinguish between the two, so it can be confusing when I look for my daily TODO items. Is there a trick to getting the scheduled and deadline agenda entries to display differently on today's agenda, or should a feature request be made?

 Is there any way to use global-prettify-symbols-mode and not have it change all TODO keywords to checkboxes? When marked as DONE, the checkboxes turn into a 'ticked' checkbox that I find very ugly. I am wondering if there is some variable I can set in the init which will get rid of this substitution while keeping the global mode on, as I do prettify a lot of other things.

 I've been using emacs on my android tablet and love it,
 however i have some terminal related issues (mostly key bindings).
 Does anyone have experience with gui version (emacs-x), is it stable?
 Or should i stick to terminal and try to do bindings more terminal friendly?

 Take a look at this screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/tzcDdYKl.png Line 10 is the last line of the buffer. There is nothing after Line 10. The fringe bitmap indicator shows the void (limbo?) after the end of the buffer. But the doc refers to this void (limbo lines) as "empty lines". Why?
 Aren't Lines 6-10 empty lines? Lines 6-10 are actual lines that contain nothing but \n. Aren't these the empty lines - the blank lines?
 Isn't everything after Line 10 limbo? visual representation of lines that don't exist / end of buffer? Help me understand the Emacs terminology? Why lines that don't exist are called "empty lines"?

In the same hour I thrown off everything about who did it and where to find tips and solutions (actually, I even doesn't remember if I had this information) and took it apart without trying to remember. Then I waited for some time to forget everything and then I found that this puzzle is a bit more complex than I thought about it.
 So I decided to write some code (surely using Haskell) to solve it. And today I did it.
 Here is repository:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for the wall of text, but I've been reading a lot of guides and not really getting the answer I need. If anyone wants to help a complete newcomer, I could really use it.
 I've read some monad tutorials/lectures and I think I have a beginner's understanding. Basically what I took away was "without unsafePerformIO, which you should not use, Monad types like M a can't be converted to a. Instead you compose your Monad functions with pure functions using operators like <$> or >>=." I also think I understand this distinction between "pure" and "monad" functions helps the haskell compiler be extremely cool.
 That sounds really good, but I'm having trouble understanding how to structure an application around this. I'm trying to teach myself Haskell by writing an interactive fiction game. So far I have an RPG-style dice roller written, but it's deterministic. I'm creating a seed from the system time inside of a do, using the <- operator. I then use (basically) randomRs (_,_) (mkStdGen seed). Because I used do and I wasn't sure what to do after that though, so I tried using unsafePerformIO and I'm almost certain this is why my dice roller rolls the same numbers every time.
 Do I have to make all my roll-processing functions and the entire skill system speak IO Int and pass up and down an updated stdGen? I am pretty sure the answer is "no," since I can use bind to invoke pure functions. But if that's true, I'm not sure how to apply that while designing a whole application.
 I guess what I'm unsure of is how to structure something larger than a few functions around all of this. Does anyone have any favorite guides or wisdom about the big-picture structure of an application written in Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on a Mac (El Capitan). With a little recent help from the emacs.stackexchange.com forum participants, I have written up a few Emacs functions to refresh the TD Ameritrade access token for its API, and to submit custom buy/sell orders for equities (although it could be for options trading too, but that's not my cup of tea). At some point in the future, I hope to write Lisp code to stream TDA data using the API and make trading decisions from within Emacs. For the near foreseeable future, however, I'll be relying upon watching the Thinkorswim desktop application to make decisions to buy/sell. Screen real estate is precious, as I need to see the charts, studies, order flow, etc.
 In a nutshell, I only need to tell Emacs: 50.35 RET and then perhaps 15 seconds later 51.25 RET. I have installed KeyboardMaestro, for systemwide keyboard shortcuts offering a variety of options, including executing scripts and so forth.
 I have two (2) Emacs options for order submission, either calling the curl executable, or running url-retrieve-synchronously.
 Any ideas regarding how to do this Emacs order entry quickly and save screen real estate would be greatly appreciated.
 BACKGROUND: There are certain custom orders available through TDA that cannot be executed programmatically from within Thinkorswim, but that should be possible through the API. Speed is the key as I am interested in momentum trades with high volatility.

 I'm using the Emacs packages simpleclip to copy to clipboard, and shell-pop to open up a terminal in Emacs quickly with a keybinding.
 Anyways, I can copy text from the terminal to the clipboard, but whenever I try to past into the terminal, it throws the error:

 `Buffer is read-only: #<buffer \*ansi-term-1\*>`

 So how do I fix this issue? I use the emacs package use-package in my .emacs config, so I'm trying to figure out what lisp code is required to fix this issue, so that I can paste into the terminal in emacs.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for the help!

 I have previously posted about my package dtache.el, which provides detachable shell commands to Emacs users. Today I merged the dtache-eshell.el library which provides the integration of dtache with eshell, previously dtache only supported M-x shell.
 You can read more about, and see some examples of dtache-eshell in action at https://niklaseklund.gitlab.io/blog/posts/dtache_eshell/, and if you are looking for the source code you will find it here https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache :)

 I've updated the example. It now uses nix flakes. The elisp files can be maintained as a dirty tree for happy hacking. Home manager is mainly used for the static aspects of user home integration rather than installing the elisp files read-only. I will be installing this on a Darwin machine sometime today.
 The Scheme
  
Straight for elisp packages & lockfiles
 Home manager for dotfiles
 Nix expressions for distributing 3rd party deps
  
Forewarning, the Emacs lisp is not marketed as good. At anything. My git tree is dirty. I mainly use the vterm integration and Rust Analyzer.
 The Future
  
Emacs can maintain its own nix profile to have a self-contained set of 3rd party dependencies like language servers and dynamic modules independently of the user environment
 Emacs can generate a home manager module for programs like vterm that want home integration
 Emacs can maintain non-package elisp configuration expressions without resorting to rigid git managed structures or rapidly decaying patchworks lifted from literate org files scattered around
  
The mix of tooling is the main work output of this project so far. Appreciate pointing out any work related to the Future

 I'm an undergrad student very interested in Haskell and functional programming in general. Doing some stuff in my spare time, however, isn't quite satisfying and I want to learn more, especially how it would look to write actual production Haskell. 
 That is why I would like to apply for an internship or job in Haskell. But here comes the problem: 
 All job offers for Haskell programmers either require years of experience with Haskell in production and/or a PhD. 
 I think this is a problem because: 
  
If nobody offers a job for beginners to work with Haskell, how does the community want to get new people who have worked years in Haskell that don't come from academia?

You don't need to install any external packages, just compile the newest source code of Emacs (at least newer than this commit by Po Lu) with "--with-pgtk" together with "--with-xwidgets" flags. Then M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url and enter a url, you could surf the Internet via Emacs!
 For people not familiar to this: pgtk port is the feature Emacs use pure GTK, which means it could run under pure Wayland. Xwidgets is a feature that allows Emacs to display GTK and NS widgets inside buffers. Xwidgets doesn't support pgtk before, Po Lu made it support pgtk.

 Writing a shell script, Emacs adds 4 tabs and 1 space. I don’t want this to happen. I want Emacs to go to the first character in the previous line. Emacs is going wild with auto-formatting. I want electricity. I like electricity. But I don’t like auto-formatting. That is, I don’t like tons of random tabs and spaces added for no reason.
 for in i in 1 2 <tab><tab><tab><tab><space><cursor is now here> 
 I don’t want that. I want :
 for in i 1 2 <cursor is here> 
 M-x electric-indent-mode doesn’t work, because then I lose electricity, which is also problematic. I like electricity, but I don’t like auto-formatting. Turning off electricity isn’t good:
 for in i 1 2 do <cursor is here> 
 I want the cursor to be aligned with the do, not at the beginning of the line. Does anyone know how to do this?

 What a wonderful gift to the emacs community to end out a difficult (I would say horrible) year and end it with hope and optimism going into 2022.

 (defun indent-buffer () (interactive) (if (not (string= major-mode 'python-mode)) (indent-region (point-min) (point-max)) (message "Not in python"))) (global-set-key (kbd "M-i") 'indent-buffer) 
 It works well but I recently found out that the default indentation is only 2 space char. I would like to have it inserting 4 chars width TABS. I tried to look in the customization group of indent.el and even used kernel coding style emacs config, which works when I press <TAB> but doesn't when using (indent-buffer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellow 'macsers,
 TL;DR: Can you tell me which function emacs invokes to ask for auth data?
 I recently heard of mini-frame-mode and fell in love. While I see the need to have a vertical display for functions and variable descriptions (marginalia ftw!), I have always been irritated by a new buffer appearing "out of nowhere" on the bottom of my screen, moving the modeline etc.
 So, I have adjusted the looks of mini-frame-mode to my liking. Now, there is one piece missing: whenever I push to my git repository, mini-frame-mode opens to prompt me for my git auth data. I don't want mini-frame-mode to handle this; instead, I want the password prompt to appear in the original mini buffer on the bottom.
 I know of the mini-frame-ignore-commands variable. However, I don't know which program is evoked by emacs to ask me for the password. I tried skimming the Messages Buffer for it, but adding magit-process-username-prompt and magit-process-password-prompt to the list didn't change anything, and I was unable to find a reference to another function in the packages' code.
 Thus: can you tell me which function emacs invokes to ask for auth data?
 Have a good day, folks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have observed some strange GHC behavior while working on my $DAYJOB project that I'd like to report as an issue on the GHC bug tracker. To do so, I intend to prepare a minimal case that reproduces the issue on the compiler version that the GHC developers would most prefer. I'm having trouble doing that though:
 1) Which is the GHC version that would be the most useful for GHC developers? 8.10.7, the one the majority of the users currently use (me included)? 9.2.1 which is the latest stable release? Or GHC HEAD? 
 2) Unless the answer to (1) above is GHC 8.10.7, what's the easiest way to obtain that GHC version, very preferably without polluting my system globally? I've built GHC HEAD using the great nix-shell provided by https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix, which allowed me to build it without installing any system dependencies globally. But I can't figure out how to run the resulting GHC, I have ./inplace/bin/runghc which I can use to interpret .hs files and I have ./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2, but that one results in a billion linker errors when I try to compile anything. I've also tried installing GHC versions via ghcup, but that one also fails because I think I'm supposed to install some system dependencies, but I really don't like doing that if at all possible.
 It might be a good idea to update the report a bug page in the GHC wiki with this information. This subreddit is probably not the best place to ask these questions, but I'm also not sure where best to engage with the GHC developers.
 Thanks for any pointers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello haskellers,
 I know this question has been asked in the past, but I'm hoping to get a more modern answer :')
 Are there any recommended resources for learning category theory and haskell?
 Some background info, I have a math undergrad degree, and I had fun with the pure math, proofs, theorems, etc. so I'd love to dive deeper into the formal math behind category theory.
 After graduating, I've had a few different roles before landing a software engineer position about 6 months ago... mainly working with JavaScript/TypeScript/node.js.
 I've also worked through the JavaScript Mostly Adequate Guide to FP, which further piqued my interest in FP, also learned some basic Clojure and used it for Advent of Code this year.
 Has anyone worked through the MIT course, Programming with Categories? Does this seem like a good place to start? Leafing through the textbook, it seems to strike a good balance between the formal math and introducing haskell basics. I was thinking of working through it, then work through a more in-depth haskell resource after (i.e. learn you a haskell or something).
 What did you use to learn category theory and/or haskell?
 Thanks in advance for your input!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on my "adulting." I'm reviewing and setting habits to help guide me in times of lower clarity. Looking at ideas for creating a tool for thinking, I came up with a tool that prompts me to refine the edits to zettel titles and 'summary relevance.'
This 'tool for thinking' results from a python program tied to Keyboard Maestro that prompts me to review titles and summaries of the last ten days of newly created zettel. As an anchor, it is tied to my practice of morning journaling. It reminds me and makes it convenient to examine each zettel title and the one-sentence 'relevance' statement to see if it makes sense and stands up to scrutiny. This is added to the bottom of that template. (pictured below) Automatic, easy peasy, the cognitive load of the initiating behavior habit off-loaded to the computer. This is not an excuse for not editing the body of each zettel. A new zettel will be on the list for ten days. That means ten opportunities for giving the zettel some love.
I'm unsettled on the format. In its current form it is a bit hard to read. I will make changes for readability.
If you're interested in how this is done, have questions about my use-case, or just want to chat let me know.
Below are pictured titles and a one-sentence summary/meaning of the zettel I'm working on. These are the ideas I'm currently wrestling with. They represent a ten-day window of new zettel.
This is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list. If any of this is of interest to you, please start a thread here, DM me, or get in touch via email.]]></summary>

And should also be able to plug this into other editors. One LSP server for everything. So far you can only try it out from within the docker container. Start pen, open a text file, python, elisp, etc. and run lsp. Anyway, I'm going to continue working on this into next year.

 I use straight.el to manage packages. I also use use-package for configuration. I have use-package configured to use straight.el. I'm using the development version org-mode, which was fantastic, until Emacs 28 started shipping with v9.5, which is all I need. The built-in version seems to load much quicker than the one I have. (I'm not byte compiling my init files; maybe I should do that?) Is there a way to make use-package use the built-in version of org-mode even though I've got straight-use-package-by-default set to t?

 ​
 I wonder if there's an easy way to create a function/hook that removes the clock drawer if the clocked minute is less than a threshold, say 5 mins?
 ​
 There is something similar in org-mode already, when the variable org-clock-out-remove-zero-time-clocks is set to true, empty clock drawers are removed after org-clock-out.

Highlight syntax is okay inside the block but when I execute with C - c C - c I get this: "No org babel execute function for sclang". Sclang seems to be supported by Babel and Org (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html) but since it was working there is no doubt sclang is supported anyways. I am also ensuring that a working installation of sclang is functional and on when executing the block. 
 I am also setting it to (require 'sclang) before anything, so cannot think anything else. Executable of the lang is declared as well and functioning okay! 
 All in all, the language is working in its mode so there is nothing else that points a reason to investigate and also when trying other languages in such as js it works okay with results appearing as expected outside the source block.
 #+begin_src js console.log("hello") #+end_src #+RESULTS: : hello : undefined 
 I have activated sclang using this below:

 I sometimes use emacs in the terminal but emacs shortcuts and terminal shortcuts clash. 
 Is there a way to disable terminal shortcuts not to clash with Emacs or is there a terminal emulator I can use that supports non-GUI Emacs fully? 
 Thanks for the help.
 Edit : 
 I use urxvt on Manjaro, I have a problem with C-<backspace> being sent to C-h and commands such as M-s not being recognized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody,
 I wanted to reach out to the reddit community about haskell salaries. The only other reddit thread on the topic I could find was from 8 years ago, so I was curious if things have changed in the past 8 years.
 According to the Stack Overflow 2021 Developer Survey, Haskell developers seem to make much less than some other "functional" languages (i.e. Clojure, F#, Elixir). Do you find this to be true in your experience?
 I'd also be interested to hear about haskell salaries in the US vs elsewhere.
 If you would like, feel free to share your salary here (for others to reference), but no pressure!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I switched to the developer version of emacs, on my latest Ubuntu distribution, I cannot use the "C-." (or "ctrl .") keyboard shortcut anymore. As soon as I press it, a strange "e" box appears on the screen (see screenshot) and emacs hangs until I press ESC or "C-." again.

 This does not happen if I start emacs in the terminal (emacs -nw)
 Is anyone else seeing this?
 How can one find out if this bug has been filed?

 What if I have one export back-end for this card and another back-end for a mermaid.js export, how can I mix both back-ends as both change the same function? Can't I just extend the html backend with more functions for other special blocks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've started a translation from Common Lisp to Scala of Forbus and de Kleer's tools from their Building Problem Solvers. At this point I have working versions of two of the more useful of their tools, the justification- and assumption-based truth maintenance systems (JTMS and ATMS).
 Truth maintenance systems track the relationships among possible beliefs, reasoning rules, incompatible/contradictory beliefs, and the conclusions we might draw from them. The JTMS stores a single context of which beliefs we might adopt; the ATMS tracks all of the various environments which might support the possible beliefs without contradiction. TMSes can guide search in reasoning engines, or can directly serve as models for program domains.
 The JTMS and ATMS code here are simple translations of F&dK's implementation, translated with minimal changes into Scala. Part of my motivation is to have a deeper look at their code, and I'll likely add documentation in the next few weeks, and possibly additional tool translations.
 On Scaladex or Github. Enjoy.

 So, if you have a "tagA" and like to see where it appears in the buffer, just create a link as 'tag-sparse:tag' and follow it. 
 Here it is the custom type link. :)

The default behaviour is that, by pressing C-; only once, it selects all occurences of the string in the whole buffer. Is there a way to expand the selection to each new match one at a time? For those familiar with, I'm basically trying to replicate Sublime Text's functionality when you Ctrl/Cmd-D over any string.
 iedit documentation mentions that "Many other work flows to highlight occurrences are possible, for example, (...) incremental selection", which sounds exactly like what I want. But looking through the documentation, available functions, and even the source code, I couldn't find the answer.
 Thaks for any help.

 I've just published a new Blog Post on a classic implementation technique for lazy functional programming: combinatory logic based graph-reduction engine.
 The implementation is structured into three parts:
  
A λ-calculus parser from A Combinatory Compiler which was extended to cover a tiny functional language based on the untyped λ-calculus.
 A compiler from λ-calculus to combinatory logic combinators (S,K,I,B,C and Y) which is based on bracket-abstraction and some optimization rules.
 A graph-reducer. Combinator terms are allocated into a graph data-structure. Which is then reduced by applying combinator graph-reduction. The destructive inplace reduction of the graph is made possible by using STRef
 mutable references.

 TLDR: how to count tags in a buffer and put them in a matrix where each cell counts the co-occurrences of both tags in a heading?
 The long story: thematic analysis is a quite common technique used to synthesize meaning in texts (those interested in a brief but good introduction, please peek https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/thematic-analysis/). In short, once done each idea in a text is marked by a tag, and then you can synthesize a text by it's tags (of course, we can also group them, but that comes after) and different texts can be compared by it's found tags.
 As we all know, emacs is a great operating system and comes not only with org-mode but also with a decent editor ;) so it was a logical idea to use both to do thematic analysis. And in the end, it seems t…]]></summary>

 p { margin: 1rem 0; } 
 For reference, this is the definition of hs-toggle-hiding:
 (defun hs-toggle-hiding (&optional e) "Toggle hiding/showing of a block. See `hs-hide-block' and `hs-show-block'. Argument E should be the event that triggered this action." (interactive) (hs-life-goes-on (posn-set-point (event-end e)) (if (hs-already-hidden-p) (hs-show-block) (hs-hide-block)))) 
 This is happening because for some reason (posn-set-point (event-end nil)) (as e is nil when hs-toggle-hiding is run as a command) would move point to somewhere that makes hs-already-hidden-p always return nil.
 Currently I'm patching the function in my config by only running posn-set-point if e is non-nil:
 (when e (posn-set-point (event-end e))) 
 which fixes it.
  
I can't imagine I'm the only person who has encountered this issue. Is this a known issue and has it perhaps been fixed in Emacs 28?

 ```
 On Haskell I've tried and it works with smaller numbers (Whatever fits into Int64), but with bigger ones:
 ```haskell
 B64.encode $ BL.toStrict $ runPut $ putInt64be 3214000000000000000000
 <interactive>:61:48: warning: [-Woverflowed-literals]
 Literal 3214000000000000000000 is out of the Int range -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807
 "AAB4iX/DNTs="
 ```
 Which does not give me the correct representation since the value is out of bounds (I think the number it sticks with is 4266531174538018816 (maxBound :: Int64) rather than the one I passed)
 ​
 So, I wanted to ask, what are my options to encode these numbers in the same way I can do on the first Elixir example? Is there a technique I'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last five years it was twice that I had to figure out how parse JSON in streaming fashion. I figured that I release a library, so I don't have to figure it out again some years in the future. I suspect this library might be useful to others too, since it is likely that I am not the only who ran into such problem. In my particular situation use cases were:
  
Parse a very large JSON file, contents of which was one very big top level dictionary with millions of key value pairs. My requirement was that I needed to modify each individual key/value pair without affecting memory overheaad.
 Continuously parse an infinite stream of log entries from a service called logentries.com where each entry was formatted as JSON and delimited by a newline.
  
conduit-aeson is capable of handling both of these use cases and probably others as well. See haddock for examples and documentation. Here is one such example:
 ```
  
  
:set -XOverloadedStrings :set -XTypeApplications import Conduit let input = "{ \"foo\": 1, \"bar\": 2, \"baz\": 3 }" runConduit $ yield input .| conduitObject @String @Int .| printC ("foo",1) ("bar",2) ("baz",3) ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the last months, me and my girlfriend moved our note taking, planning etc. from TiddlyWiki to Emacs OrgMode and so far we both like it. But there is one big thing im missing: "dynamic aggregation".
 In TiddlyWiki I can automatically query and format many information throughout the Wiki. Easy tasks like displaying a table of all D&D sessions is achievable with the column mode, but how about more complex aggreagations? For my studies, I created tiddlers for every subject including information for CP, semester, and category. In my overview, each semester is listed as seperate heading with the subjects being displayed by category as description lists and the CP summed up for each category. Please refer to the screenshot.
 In TiddlyWiki I can use filter expressions to select any tiddler (entry) from the wiki and extract data from it. This data can be transformed into arbitrary HTML, which is rendered when the article is visited. This query and transformation is done in the Wiki's own syntax, which is a part of the reason I wanted to switch to Emacs.
 How would I recreate this in OrgMode? I'm okay with having all information in one file and don't mind to learn elisp. What I would like to have is the information to be displayed inline (not in another buffer) and being able to use all or most of OrgModes usual formatting options.

 I'm currently switching python IDE to move to full emacs. I'm therefore trying to take with me the few things I really liked from my former python IDE (Spyder) and add all the new features that made me move to emacs.
 One important step for me is to replicate the Spyder Dark Theme within Emacs (because I like it, am used to it and am not really satisfied with other ones I tried so far). What I have, is the spec of the theme that you can see in the screenshot attached.
 Unfortunately now I am really stuck in how to proceed to convert those hex colors to an emacs custom theme, as a complete emacs newbie... Any help would be much appreciated!
 ​
 Have a nice holiday season!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if this is something that's okay to post here, but I figure I'll give it a shot. I wrote this C++ Yasnippet script a few months ago, and I use it basically every day.
 # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: function # key: fn # contributor: conscat # -- ${3:$(map-void yas-text "void " "auto ")}${1:name}($2)${3:$(map-void yas-text "" " -> ")}$3 { $0 } 
 The most interesting part is map-void, which I define like this:
 (defun map-void (check replace-t replace-f) (interactive) (if (string= check "") replace-t replace-f)) 
 Here's what it does:
 I type fn, then press TAB. That expands into this (white space a little different). The | represents my cursor:
 void |func() {}
 I can type in a function name here. I press TAB again:
 void foo(|) {}
 Now I can type in a parameter list, and TAB again:
 void foo(int moo)| {}
 Now here's the cool part. If I type in anything, a -> is automatically inserted, and the void at the front becomes auto!
 auto foo(int moo) -> boo|{}
 And then I TAB into the body of my function and type the rest. I know it's not that crazy, but it's the ability to just do these kind of neat hacks that makes me appreciate Emacs so much.

 Another limitation of bm is it only exposes bookmarks in open buffers, again, I can hack in support to show all stored bookmarks for the repository I'm working on, but this isn't trivial - it may be simpler to use a package that already supports this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I stumbled on a certain feature some time ago, and completely forgot where I found it.
 But I remember what it does:
  
find every occurrence of some regex, say "printf," recursively in a directory tree (call this the "gather" step)
 populate a buffer with every line matching that regex; edit in that buffer as if it were a file
 on "save," have every modified line "scattered" back out to its original file
  
Anyone kind enough to point out a package that does this or something close to it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am new to haskell so this might be a noob question.
 Let's say I have a function
 haskell sequenceMaybe :: [Maybe a] -> Maybe [a]  This allows me to do things like haskell sequenceMaybe [Just 1, Just 4]  where a is inferred to be Int. All is well
 But what if I have an array like haskell [Just 1, Just "mystring"]  is there a way to write a function that will abstract over all these types? I only need a function that return true if any of the Maybes is Nothing, or false otherwise. So I do not need any constraint on the inner type.
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to get emacs native compliation working, and keep running into the following error.
 {.example} error: Cannot find libgccjit library 
 I have tried installing emacs with native compliation a number of ways
  
 Downloading and compiling from emacs master branch
  Downloading and compiling emacs-ng from master branch
  Downloading from snap edge
  
all resulting in some variation of error being unable to find libgccjit, for example another one reads
 {.example} Error (use-package): projectile/:config: Cannot find libgccjit library Disable showing Disable logging Error (use-package): org-roam/:config: Cannot find libgccjit library Disable showing Disable logging 
 Running on pop~os~
 I thought that I may not have the right version of libgccjit installed, but it appears that I have versions for gcc 9, 10, and 11 installed (default gcc is v11)
 {.example} $> find /usr/lib/gcc/ -type f -name "*jit*" /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/include/libgccjit.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/include/libgccjit++.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/include/libgccjit.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/include/libgccjit++.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include/libgccjit.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include/libgccjit++.h 
 I can succesfully compile and run the jit example from https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html without issue.
 Any suggestions on what I need to do to get emacs to find the right libgccjit?
 Edit: Thank you, the problem has been resolved. I actually had some code in my init.el which was causing the problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really like helm's fuzzy search for commands and buffers, but I cannot get it to work for files. Since this is such a well-known package, I assume the fault lies with me. Hopefully someone here knows what I am doing wrong.
 The situation: I am in my home directory. I want to add a note to the file ~/work/notes/todo.org.
 What I currently do: I enter "wo C-j not C-j do <Enter>", which is basically bash-style completion with C-j instead of the tab key and does not feel very helm-y.
 What the internet tells me to do: I have seen multiple posts of users claiming that I should be able to do this the helm way, e.g. entering "todo" first, then remembering the folder and narrowing with "work". However, this does not work for me. Even if I remove all my custom init settings, helm-find-files just doesn't do that.
 So what am I doing wrong? Is there a setting I need to enable?
 Other things I am aware of: I know there is also helm-find, but that a) is not fuzzy and b) takes upwards of 60 seconds (!) to find a file in my home directory even if I enter the complete file name, which is clearly not acceptable.There is also helm-projects-find-files, which seems to be for individual software projects and wants me to set up a project tree.
 I am aware that without some form of indexing, finding a file by name might just not be feasible. In that case, it would suffice if I could look for "notes", find nothing, then add a space and "work" and helm would be smart enough to expand those directories in reverse order. It feels like that is what the helm project page advertises anyway, but it just doesn't happen when I try it.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I want to open a file, navigating a file system is probably the slowest. What usually works is looking in recently accessed files, be it recentf or just searching mini-buffer history.
 Finding file in a project usually works the best (Projectile), but it would probably work even better if it could just search the entire system.
 If I'm certain I have had this file open this session and haven't killed it yet, I can try switching between buffers (C-x b), but that usually only works on short trips and is rarely ergonomic.
 So if I'm not sure if the buffer is still alive, and if what I'm looking it belongs in the same project as what I'm looking for. recentf and history don't really land themselves well to exploratory navigation. 
 What we're left with is find-file which looks and works amazingly with ivy, counsel, or even ido. But I often find myself frustrated, when changing a buffer takes more effort than you'd think it'd be necessary.
 Then I end up wishing I'd have mixed results, including recent files, input history, maybe project files, and so you could switch between them. ivy has different actions and that's cool, but can it change the data source on the fly?

 autocmd FileType c nmap <buffer> <F2> :sv <bar>terminal bash -c "gcc -o %:r % -lncurses && ./%:r && rm %:r"<CR>
 To compile and run C files quickly, it first splits the current buffer and open a new terminal buffer in the new one where it compiles the file name and run the binary, after that it deletes the binary file from the directory.
 How can I make Emacs do something similar? I used `quickrun` package before, but opening a new shell window usually destroys my other windows organization, I'd like to use something like my vim workflow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Emacs for maybe six months now on both my Windows and Linux machines for all my programming, word processing, and personal organization. Couldn't be happier with my productivity, and the community is great! Tons of tutorials, terrific documentation on almost all the packages I need, and just generally cool, helpful folks. I've followed the community's advice on a whole lot of matters, including keybindings: I read people saying that CUA bindings would interfere with the bindings of many Emacs packages, that made sense to me, so I've learned and ingrained Emacs bindings into my brain. It's great! Until those terrible, dark times when...I need to leave Emacs.
 And discover that Emacs has trashed my muscle memory.
 Whenever I'm in a browser (can't use EWW for everything...right??), I find myself constantly closing tabs when I meant to cut text. I save files when I mean to search. If I use another app for long enough, I eventually do adapt back to CUA, but if I'm rapidly switching back-and-forth between Emacs and anything else, I start making mistakes the moment I relax into autopilot.
 How do y'all handle this? Do you extend Emacs bindings out to the rest of your system (and does that work across platforms)? Do you suck it up and tread carefully outside Emacs? What do you do when you face an app that can't be easily brought into the Emacs ecosystem?

 Please give it a try. Here is a cabal.project template: https://gist.github.com/Bodigrim/9834568f075be36a1c65e7aaba6a15db
 This work would not be complete without a blazingly-fast UTF-8 validator, submitted by Koz Ross into bytestring-0.11.2.0, whose contributions were sourced via HF as an in-kind donation from MLabs. I would like to thank Emily Pillmore for encouraging me to take on this project, helping with the proposal and permissions. I'm grateful to my fellow text maintainers, who've been carefully reviewing my work in course of the last six months, as well as helpful and responsive maintainers of downstream packages and GHC developers.

 Anyone who meets the following criteria should apply:
  
Candidates should have enough bandwidth to review merge requests to base on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month), and sustain this for their 3 years term in a healthy manner.
 Candidates should be able to contribute opinions and analysis to issues raised by the community as a part of the CLC proposal process on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month).
 Candidates should be good communicators, and at least be able to articulate to the CLC team when they will be available vs. unavailable.
 Candidates should be productive, and be able to follow through on merge requests and conversations to their completion in a diligent and timely manner.
  
We encourage any and all who satisfy these requirements to apply. Please note that we are not looking for the biggest galaxy brain in the room - quite the opposite. We are looking for productive, motivated individuals who want to help support the ecosystem that we love. As such, we hope to build a broad sample of the community.
 Candidates, who stand for CLC Elections back in September, are most welcome to apply again.
 How can I apply?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have often been in the position of giving advice to a novice programmer on what text editor to adopt for their day-to-day programming. Needless to say, I always recommend Emacs.
 I estimate that I have given such recommendation to 30-40 people over the years.
 AFAIK, my success rate so far is 0.00%. 1
 I would like to improve this abysmal success rate.2
 Hence I would like to ask those of you who resisted adopting Emacs at first, but ultimately did so, what took you so long? What were the barriers?
 And to those who have a better success rate than 0.00% at getting others to adopt Emacs, what is your secret?
 1 What is even more bewildering, some of these programmers, who ended up choosing a different editor, have later told me that they wished that they could do with their editors the things that I can do with Emacs. (To hear them say such things one would think that they had had to settle for a less powerful editor, because Emacs had not been an option for them, somehow.)
 2 My motivation here is not mere proselitism. Some of the people in question are actually co-workers, and I just want them to be more productive. It pains me to see how unproductive they are on account of the editors they use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When providing a type to users, a library can also provide lenses for that type without actually depending on lens. This is because Lens is a type synonym, so you can simply write a function with the correct signature and export it, to be used like a Lens. And even though there is a wide variety of lens packages (lens, optics, microlens, etc.) such a function is likely to work with most of them.
 This is all preamble to my actual question: how can a library do the same for streams? There are a number of streaming libraries out there (conduit, pipes, streaming, streamly, etc.) and a hypothetical library author would might like to provide streams or stream combinators to users that are compatible with as many of them as possible, but don't explicitly rely on those libraries. Does anyone have any information about what this could look like (assuming its even possible)?

 After a lot of trial and errors from my config, I pinpointed to the good-scroll package which seems to behave weirdly on wayland or maybe it's on pgtk or native-comp, i am not so sure. It does not show up when running on Xorg.
 just to make sure I am not insane I have made a video :

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Game made with apecs and gloss crashes when trying to read input from Nintendo Switch.
 Inspired by this post, I am recreating the Unity 2D tutorial in Haskell using apecs and apecs-gloss. I am nearly done: The graphics are rendered correctly, the levels are generated appropriately, the player responds to keyboard input, etc.
 As an extra, I want to be able to control the game with the Nintendo Switch joy cons. I have successfully connected the joy cons and I'm reading the input in the stepping function (6th argument of play - called periodically) instead of the event handling function (5th argument), as the latter only recognizes keyboard and mouse input. Here is an excerpt of what I'm doing in the step function, the full details of handleSwitch can be seen here (essentially read input if the buttons are pressed when the stepping function is called, interpret the input and update the scene).
 stepGame :: Float -> C.System' () stepGame dT = do ... ASTM.forkSys (Switch.handleSwitch dT) ... 
 Unfortunately, the player may respond to the first few inputs but then the game crashes. I thought it was a race hazard so I wrapped handleSwitch in forkSys (creates a new thread for switch input) but the issue persists.
 Any ideas on what might be going wrong and how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've long been a bit jealous of Mac users with the Choosy application that prompts the user for which browser they'd like to use every time they open a link. The only open source Linux alternative I've found is Braus, but I struggled to get it working. So, I let the matter drop - it wasn't important enough to me at the time. 
 However, it's starting to feel a bit more necessary in Emacs (for me). My entire life is in org files - both personal and professional. I tend to use separate browsers for work and personal use, so I'd love if anyone has clever solutions for this every time I open a link in Emacs. I should add, there are also times when I just want to use eww if I'm just looking up some documentation or static content. 
 I'm guessing I could either create some bindings for each browser function or I could manipulate the browser function to actually run a custom elisp function that opens a prompt. I'm just a bit curious if anyone else has felt the same way and if you have any insights you might be willing to share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, First time experience running Haskell, I wanted to spend some time learning the fundamentals during these holidays break. 
 I installed the Stack installer for windows to a Win10 core i5 (late 2019) laptop with 8 gigs of ram. I then proceeded to create an 'hello world' project - - stack downloaded GHC 8.10 and created a cabal file (very confused between cabal and stack differences but, I'll go with the flow). 
 The machine behaves well with other programing platforms. however, with Haskell/stack it seems very slow... I'm running stack build and stack test and it takes up to 1 minute in both cases if there is any change to compile (without recompilation, still takes about 30 secs).
 Was just wondering if this slowness is expected? I remember using it on a Ubuntu machine and didn't notice it being so slow. Maybe it has to do with the underlying C compiler arch?

If I try to file an issue on the emacs-helm github, I get this: An owner of this repository has limited the ability to open an issue to users that are collaborators on this repository. So how do I file issues? The issue might not even be with helm. The issue is when I run helm-make-projectile, it doesn't register targets as targets if they are followed by a '\' character. Not a huge deal. Just wanted to make it known. Just don't know how.

 I use a slightly modified version of the [[https://depp.brause.cc/gotham-theme/][Gotham theme]]. I want to list a couple of the advantages, in order of importance to me: 
  
The low contrast is easier on my eyes, especially in low-light settings which I prefer to work most of the day. The cyan color of the text is about the right contrast against the black; full white on black feels like the light is "drilling" into my eyeballs, with a bit of a haze effect the more I read.

 If there are multiple types of identifiers in a header such as both a custom id and an org-id, how can I get it to choose the org-id, or at least get it to choose all the possible options so i can choose which one to use?

 I have updated my package, dtache, to version 0.2 today. In short the major improvements compared to 0.1 are:
  
Support for macOS users
 A single completion interface with support for (improved) annotations, out of the box
 The dtache-env is optional and not required for the package to work
 Better error handling
  
I made a short video going through the changes as well as showing how to use the package. The video can be seen as a continuation on the previous video about the package: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De5oXdnY5hY
 The package can be found at: https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache

I heavily rely on tags to organize the notes and a feature that I wasn't able to find in org-roam is the possibility to have a list of all the tags I created, so that I can select a tag from this list and obtain a list of files with that tag. I know I can use org-roam-node-find, type the name of a tag and filter the files with that tag. However, given the large amount of tags I'm using, it's very hard to memorize all of them and I don't always know the exact name of the tag I'm looking for. Therefore, having a complete list with all the tags would be very helpful for me. Do you know if there's a way of having this feature in org-roam?

:PROPERTIES:
 :ID: 6dc9fdfe-d24a-4eaf-8152-1f663ba70a2e
 :END:
 #+title: example 
 * Header
 [[attachment:filename]]
  
Here the file filename is in the folder that is named based on the ID value: .attach/6d/c9fdfe-d24a-4eaf-8152-1f663ba70a2e, and I can link to the file without any issue.
 After I run org-id-get-create for * Header, I had a new ID added for the header, and it becomes something like below
  
* Header
 :PROPERTIES:
 :ID: cd858afc-45ca-4f3d-bde8-a6f68c8acad0
 :END:
 [[attachment:filename]]
  
Now the attachment link to the file filename does not work any more, I have to move the file to a new folder for the new ID created, i.e., .attach/cd/858afc-45ca-4f3d-bde8-a6f68c8acad0.
 This is annoying and I just wonder if there is a way to let the header * Header to search attachment in its parent's attachment folder as well? I tried to set org-attach-use-inheritance or set org-use-property-inheritance to t, but neither works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, in talking with a fellow developer they shared that they had recently switched from Atom to VS Code. I shared my departure from Atom and trying Vim, VS Code, and finally settling on Emacs.
 I shared Magit, Embark + WGrep, Hydra menus, Hammerspoon's editWithEmacs, and finally some functions I've written to help automate common tasks in writing pull requests (conformant to our company's Github PR template).
 I explained that while VS Code might be an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), I find Emacs to be an Integrated Computering Environment (ICE).
 I'm finding the more I use Emacs, the more I think about how I interact with files and text. I didn't convert anyone from VS Code to Emacs, but then again were I "only writing software" I probably would be using VS Code.

I don’t quite understand how to debug the Elixir LSP features (I’m mostly an elixir dev) and I don’t really know elisp to this point. I’m probably doing a bunch of awful shit and not realizing how much I could make my life easier. Plug-ins are weird, the docs confuse me. I want to learn emacs for real, and the idea of hand-rolling a vanilla config is kind of overwhelming and crazy to me. How can I dive into the world of emacs in little, manageable doses without biting off way more than I can chew or getting in over my head so far I just walk away?

 I've just set up emacs on a new machine using a configuration file that I am using already without any particular issues. 
 On the new box, every time I start up emacs, there is always the request to define the "fridge indicator" and it presents me 2 options:
 "Always"
 "Only When Focused"
 Once I pick up one choice the buffer get closed but it is quite annoying.
 What could be the cause of it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear friends,
I'm releasing phi-notes, an emacs package implementing a minor mode to work with a flavour of the Zettelkasten system I've been using for some years now.  It has the following characteristics:
Notes are identified by unique, sequential numbers (0001, 0002 etc.).
Notes may be linked using the wikilink syntax ([[0001]]).
Notes may have "parent" and "descendant" notes; they may also be linked to project notes.
Bibliographical annotation is supported with BibTeX references.
Notes may have tags (identified by #hashtags).
Notes have a YAML(ish) frontmatter to keep metadata and are (preferably, but not necessarily) written in Markdown.
The aim of this project is to develop features to ease the creation, navigation and linking of notes in one or multiple note repositories.
A sidebar functionality makes the minor-mode particularly useful for working with structure notes:

Other functionalities include: creating descendant notes, integration with helm, helm-ag and helm-bibtex; "killing" and "yanking" to notes, searching for tags and backlinks; navigation commands for visiting the parent, following links.
Some details of the implementation might be too personal, but the code may at least be useful as a starting point. I'm calling it a phi minor mode because this is how I named my system long ago.
More information and a setup guide are available on the GitHub project documentation.
Merry Christmas! 🎄]]></summary>

 (defun consult-better-jumper () (interactive) (consult--read (better-jumper--get-jump-list) :prompt "Jump to: " :annotate (consult--line-prefix) :category 'consult-location :sort nil :require-match t :lookup #'consult--lookup-location :history '(:input consult--line-history) :add-history (thing-at-point 'symbol) :state (consult--jump-state))) 
 When I run this with M-x consult-better-jumper I get the following error:
 cl--assertion-failed: Assertion failed: (or (functionp candidates) (obarrayp candidates) (hash-table-p candidates) (not candidates) (stringp (car candidates)) (and (consp (car candidates)) (stringp (caar candidates))) (and (consp (car candidates)) (symbolp (caar candidates)))) 
 Upon investigation this error clearly comes from consult--read
 I guess my question boils down to how I can turn the list returned from `better-jumper--get-jump-list) into a data structure that consult can understand?

I’ve taken python which I found decent and enjoyable but I’ve heard mixed reviews about Haskell. I’m taking another programming class but I know myself and once it starts getting harder I might fall behind since I heard Haskell is extremely hard to learn. 
 I have about a month before classes resume and would love to do something productive with my time. So I’m wondering if anyone knows any good platforms or sites that do a really good job at teaching Haskell.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am going through Typeclassopedia, and currently got stuck at the first set of exercises in the Monad section, namely the 3rd one:
  
Implement Functor and Monad instances for Free f, defined as data Free f a = Var a | Node (f (Free f a)) You may assume that f has a Functor instance. This is known as the free monad built from the functor f.
  
I got the Functor instance for Free f, but with my Monad instance I am getting this error when trying to load it into ghci:
 • Could not deduce (Applicative (Free f)) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: Functor f bound by the instance declaration at Freemonad.hs:22:10-36 • In the instance declaration for ‘Monad (Free f)’ 
 My guess is that that's due to this part in the monad definition in Control.Monad
  
class Applicative m => Monad m where
  
which it seems like it wasn't always there.
 So:
  
Is there some other way around it, or do I have to provide instance of Applicative for Free f first? Bonus question: should Typeclassopedia be updated to include this information?
 I can't figure out how to implement Applicative for Free f, any hints?
  
In case it matters, here is my Monad instance, that I have convinced myself on paper that it should work
 instance Functor f => Monad (Free f) where return = Var (Var x) >>= g = g x (Node x) >>= g = Node $ (fmap.(flip (>>=))) g x 
 but I have also tried implementation from this stackoverflow answer and got same error in ghci.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a program in Emacs Lisp that turns a decimal number into a base-256 number. The numbers involved are very large, so here's the logic of it, where base256 is an array of unicode characters, myNum is a number in the septenseptuagintacentillions, and output is an output variable initially set to nil:
  (while (>= myNum 1) (setq output (concat output (aref base256 (mod myNum 256)))) (setq myNum (truncate (/ myNum 256)))) 
 I want to rewrite it in Haskell, but I'm having some trouble. Obviously, I can't use the same logic in Haskell, so here is what I have so far: ``` -- Builds an array of integers by taking the modulus of each iteration of dividing a number by 256 buildNum num = [mod x 256 | x <- (iterate trunkDiv num)] where trunkDiv l = truncate $ div l 256
 -- Create an array by accessing the item in my array of symbols that corresponds to a number in an array of integers mapNum nums syms = [syms !! y | y <- nums]
 main :: IO () main = do putStrLn $ mapNum (buildNum myNum) base256 ``` Now, as far as I can tell, what I need is to stop iterating when the truncated product of my number and 256 reaches 1, but I don't know where to even begin looking for that information.
 Could anybody give me some pointers on getting this to work?

This package empowers dired by giving it a modern UI in a unintrusive way. Emacs users deserve a file manager better than those popular ones on terminal such as ranger, vifm, lf since Emacs is not limited to a terminal.
 dirvish-minibuffer-preview.el is an extension for dirvish, it provides dirvish-minibuf-preview-mode, which is a feature to preview file when narrowing file/directory candidates using minibuffer.
 In dirvish, you can mark files across multiple dirvish buffers, and paste/move marked files/directory to current directory with one keystroke (dirvish-yank).
 The name dirvish is a tribute to vim-dirvish.

We can represent a list of numbers using List(1,2,3). So is list a kind ? Or is list a type constructor ?. we are not constructing any new type here using type constructor which is list or may be I really need to see from differ perspectives inorder to understand it. And moreover what is a higher kind Vs Kind. I’m learning advanced scala to understand how types and type level programming works . Please help me out understanding these words /vocabulary ? Thank you

 If anyone is inclined to pick up where we left off, or start a brand new branch using some or all of what we did, please do! Please communicate your intent on the PR itself so if there are others who want to also work on it, you don't have to duplicate their work.
 There's another new tool in this same space, Stack Lint Extra Deps. The maintainer was kind enough to get on a phone call with us on Monday to discuss pros and cons of working on SLED vs Renovate, and the consensus is we'd all like to see Renovate support Haskell first. But Renovate is written in TypeScript and SLED is written in Haskell so if you'd like to help but don't like/know TypeScript, SLED is a good candidate to hack on :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 (my question is not 100% emacs related, posting it here cause there are lots of programmable keyboard users on the sub and discussion might be useful)
 I am new to keyboard layouts, could you help me with the following?
  
Layer toggles vs combos
  
Let say i want to have navigation on ijkl,
 I could toggle on / off navigation layer when modifier button is pressed
 or i can make combos: modifier+i = up, modifier+j = left, etc.
 Which approach is better and when each of them should be used?
 With first you have to be mentally aware about current “modes” you are in, with second you have to keep modifier button pressed.
  
Modifiers vs different keys to express degree of action.
  
Let say i have following 3 actions: (emacs related)
 delete char
 delete word
 delete line 
 I could make them
 Modifier1 + d, Modifier1 + w, Modifier1 + e
 Or i can make them
 Modifier1 + d, Modifier2 + d, Modifier3 + d
 Which approach is better / more logical? How would you do it and why?
  
What writer/programmer friendly layouts you can recommend for inspiration? (40% or 60%, not bigger). I am not interested to learn about letter layouts (qwerty, dvorak, etc) but more about positions / layering of universal keys (delete, backspace, enter, navigation, numbers, etc) I saw miryoku layout, is there smng else to learn from?
 
Are there other resources you can recommend related to above? 
 
 p.s. I have all modifiers under thumbs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for inspirations.
 I wonder how many people are still using ledger for their personal finance given there are a lot of online services with good phone apps.
 One of my goals in 2022 is to keep my finance in a good shape. I previously used ledger and org-capture to log transactions and reporting. but it's a lot of work given the number of transactions per week. this is one of the reasons i give up. If i continue to use emacs/ledger, i need to simplify the workflow, maybe import from CSV and convert to ledger once a week/month or something. 
 ​
 another reason I gave up is that i have joint accounts, using emacs/ledger makes it harder to share.
 ​
 any comments on how you use Emacs or not use Emacs for personal finance would be greatly appreciated!

For example if I have a file ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt and I type C-x C-f ~/foo/qux, ido-mode automatically searches ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt and autocompletes it in the find-file minibuffer.
 But when I do the same thing with fido-mode, nothing happens. In fido-mode, I am required to type the complete path like C-x C-f ~/foo/bar/baz/qux and only then it autocompletes the path to ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt.
 It seems that ido-mode can search for filename matches recursively in subdirectories. How can I get the same result in fido-mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 When folding in org-mode, if I'm not on a heading, I use outline-up-heading to move to the parent heading of the content and fold the heading using org-cycle. However, in doing so, the cursor becomes trapped in the invisible region of the heading's content, as shown by invisible-p (point), in such a way that, if I quickly change my mind and want to unfold the heading again, I can't just org-cycle again; I have to manually move the cursor into a visible region of the header, like the beginning of the line, then org-cycle to unfold.
 So basically my question is: How do I move the cursor to a visible region after folding a heading, and not get stuck in an invisible region, and be forced to move the cursor manually?
 Thank you kindly for the help!
  
UPDATE: I've solved this using (while (invisible-p (point)) (backward-char)), but it seems a tad inefficient; is there a better way to do this?

 Lot's of interest, judging from the epic threads that have ensued since then.
 There aren't many programming languages or systems where you can just assume the existence of a built-in relational database. The IBM AS/400 was one such system from the 80s. Emacs could become one if the SQLite plan is executed.
 Looking forward to org-mode tables that are backed and fed from RDBMS tables.

 I just came across this one (from here) and I wonder how I ever did without it.
 (defadvice kill-line (before kill-line-autoreindent activate) "Kill excess whitespace when joining lines. If the next line is joined to the current line, kill the extra indent whitespace in front of the next line." (when (and (eolp) (not (bolp))) (save-excursion (forward-char 1) (just-one-space 1)))) 
 Another great one that springs to mind is Radian's find-file advice that automatically creates and deletes parent directories of new files.

 I thought about using DataKinds and KindSignatures to set if the Item can be used in trades and i thought about putting the class of a mage like if he is a Mage as a Phantom type. I dunno if it's a dumb but i want to learn creative ways to enforce some properties.
 What are the cool mechanics that u can enforce using types in Haskell? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, i just started to be a good citizen and write some regression tests for my code.
 Considering i have some error-type and a function that might result in an error:
 ```haskell newtype Username = Username{unUsername::Text} data UsernameError = ErrorNameLength | ErrorNameIllegalCharacter
 -- smart constructor for username newUsername :: Text -> Either LoginError Username newUsername name = ... -- inspects argument and might return Left ```
 in my HUnit test, how would I assert that e.g. newUsername with "" results in ErrorNameLength?
 My thoughts is to do it with pattern matching in do notation, relying on the MonadFail instance of IO. While this works, i see that HUnits assertion-functions allow to provide a descriptive error message in case of failure.
 Therefore I am questioning wether this would be the correct way.

I wrote a small to medium-sized series on using the Zettelkasten to deal with fiction (both analysation and creating). To make the series more whole, I thought to give you the chance to ask any questions you have. I will publish the answers as the last installment of the series.
So, what are your questions?

 Basically what the title says; how can I, for example, highlight a region with, say, shift-selection, and then use something like TAB on it to indent it? Or anything like that, really.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my continued attempt to get mstksg's AOC template working, I temporarily gave up on my MacOS attempt (thanks again /u/simonmic for the help so far!) and switched to my Linux box. After a long failure trying to use apt-get install haskell-platform and getting unfixable (by me) dependency errors, I switched to using ghcup (why do we even have haskell-platform if it's not going to work?), and things seem to be compiling and running.
 But now I have some (hopefully basic) questions. - The "Interactive" section of the documentation says I should be able to import an AOC.Run.Interactive package. I do not see how to do this. Where / how do I run ghci to import this? I can see the Haskell file in src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs, but import AOC.Run.Interactive fails with ghci run in either the top level or down in src. If I :l src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs I get Illegal lambda-case (use LambdaCase), but I didn't think that was the right thing in the first place. I assume I'm missing something simple and obvious here? - The "Executable" section of the documentation says I should be able to get a plain old runnable executable aoc-dev. How do I get this? Right now I'm using cabal run aoc-dev run 1 a for instance. (If I do build an executable, do I need to rebuild it when I change a day's solution?)
 As always any help is most appreciated.

Only within the myproject repository there is a subdirectory source/projects/myproject.
 Problem Statement: I want to edit the common code only within the master branch. How can I have Emacs default to read-only mode when opening files from myproject/source/shared and myproject/source/common-applications, but not from myproject/projects/myproject?
 FWIW, I am using treemacs and would love to find/create some sort of hook within that context.

 The role will involve developing a special purpose processor for Haskell, aimed at outperforming the throughput and energy performance of CPUs. The project is inspired by graph reduction machines like GRIN from the 1980s, and modern FPGA/ASIC protypes PilGRIM and Reduceron.
 Candidates should have a background in hardware design and FPGA programming. Hardware engineering experience should include circuit design, developing processor architectures, memory hierarchies and/or instruction sets. Candidates should have some understanding of functional programming. Programming language implementation experience is desirable, but not essential. The project has close industry ties with Xilinx in Ireland and QBayLogic in the Netherlands.
 It is a three year project, starting in May 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asking this for u/Lucky-Lambda since he is a new user and has been waiting for days for moderators to approve his post:
 ==== QUOTE START ====
 I am trying to test a Stack project that contains an exe, lib, and tests. We have tests for lib now (with lib listed under test `dependencies:`), and exe depends on lib in the same way, but there is an aspect of the exe I'd like to test.
 I have tried to use `verbatim` in my package.yaml to get hpack to pass along `build-tool-depends`:, which should allow me to reference a `project:executable`. I do see it does include it at the bottom of that `test-suite` in the generated Cabal output, but I still get a `Could not find module` in the test file itself (what I am importing there is listed in the `executable` section `other-modules:`) when running `stack test`.
 I have also tried referencing the exe in the new test with `build-tools:`. It makes it into the cabal file, but without the project name prefix I originally included, and does not seem to help either.
 Any possible things I am missing or should try instead? It generates a cabal file with what I thought should work, but it does not seem to be exposing the module I am trying to import from exe in the test. Thanks so much! 
 Versions: * Stack resolver: lts-18.15 * Cabal: Cabal-3.2.1.0 * Running on a M1 Mac 12.1 in a Rosetta terminal (should not be ARM related, as it builds/tests just fine without the above attempt, just giving for context)
 ==== QUOTE END ====
 Remark from me (u/Martinsos): We also read that one solution is to move all the exe code to the lib and then exe just becomes an extremely thin wrapper. However, I love having this separation between exe and lib, on one hand to make sure that lib doesn't in any way depend on exe, and also because external/hackage dependencies are nicely separated, so I would rather avoid that if there is a nicer way to do it.

So far i have tried `replace-string`, `replace-regexp` and `query-replace`. Any attempt says that there were 0 occurrences.

 There wasn't a followup given to this statement in the book I am reading and I am trying to wrap my head around it. It is easy to follow how a Num must be Eq, but why does it also have to be a Show. If anything I would imagine conforming to Read would be required. 
 So when you do 5 * (6::Double), internally do a read as Double for 5. 
 Is it that compiler does (read (show 5)::Double) * (6::Double)?

 I recently replaced my ssh-agent by gnupg (https://opensource.com/article/19/4/gpg-subkeys-ssh). This works fine outside of emacs (I can ssh server and it uses the gpg key). This part (replacing ssh-agent with gpg) especially does not work inside emacs, other parts (decrypting a file with gpg) work fine.
 This is all from withing emacs -nw -Q. This is all in the terminal, emacs not graphical.
 I am able to use emacs to edit an ecrypted .gpg file from within emacs, it asks for the password in the minibuffer and I can enter it: https://i.imgur.com/SON3tM6.png
 However I also use my gpg keys to access other computers through ssh (enable-ssh-support in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf), and it seems emacs can't handle it well. The prompt in this case is broken and it doesn't detect my keystroke…]]></summary>

Since we don't have nice IDEs like Visual Studio on Linux and using Vim(the editor I usually use) as an IDE looks like a really stupid idea since bloating it with a bunch of plugins will make it slow and unpleasant to use, I am turning to Emacs which is more than a text editor(how much more I don't know, I just know it isn't just a text editor) and you can bloat it with plugins without really slowing it down much. I chose DOOM Emacs because I played with it half a year ago and liked the fact that it used the Vim key bindings by default, so I didn't really have to re-learn how to edit text files, and the fact that it comes pre-configured in a nice way, saving me a lot of time.
 Anyway, what I want to ask is if I can turn Emacs into a nice C ID, and if it is possible, how do I do that. Thanks in advance.

Flakes
Flakes are a new format to package Nix-based projects in a more
discoverable, composable, consistent and reproducible way. A flake is
just a repository or tarball containing a file named flake.nix that
specifies dependencies on other flakes and returns any Nix assets such
as packages, Nixpkgs overlays, NixOS modules or CI tests.
You can read more about flakes in the following blog posts:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I use emacs mostly for academic writing. As a beginner, I thoroughly enjoy org-mode. However, for practical reasons (journal submission, co-authoring, etc.), I need to create a word document (.docx) more often than I thought. I've used pandoc to convert .tex to .docx, which I am more or less satisfied with. 
 I wonder if anyone has a nice workflow for academic writing, which often needs to end up with a word document. For example, if a bibliography is included, which, markdown or org-mode, gives you a better experience? Or are there other options? Any suggestion will be welcome!

how do you handle famous quotes?
Do you rewrite them in you own words or do keep the original words?
How do you organise them?

Or do you collect quotes by author (or topic) on a (big) zettel?

To give you some context, I never professionally worked with Scala so I have a lot of assumptions which certainly aren't applicable.
 My first question would be about Tagless Final and ZIO. Because ZIO embeds its own Error type as ZIO[R, E, A], if using ZIO as a Tagless Final, it becomes possible to abstract and hide away one layer or Errors. So I have been trying to separate System errors from Business errors in the sake of having a Domain layer curated of error handling for the System errors.
 System error would be, what I qualify as lower level and environmental errors, as network connection drop, remote service being unreachable, etc. Business erro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am interested in creating a "filtered" switch-to-buffer function. I was looking into the read-buffer function as its 4th argument PREDICATE mentions
  
Optional arg PREDICATE, if non-nil, is a function limiting the buffers that 
 can be considered. It will be called with each potential candidate, in 
 the form of either a string or a cons cell whose car is a string, and 
 should return non-nil to accept the candidate for completion, nil otherwise.
  
To my understanding, the predicate function needs to take one input argument which is a string or cons cell and when read-buffer is called it will pass every open buffer to the function and will only output those buffers that returned a non-nil value. At least this is what I understand from the docstring. 
 However, in practice, how exactly would you call read-buffer with this function as its 4th argument. I couldn't find any info online about it so I was wondering if this community had any clue how it works.

 I'm working on a programming assignment where I'm asked to speed up a BFS type algorithm (a N-puzzle solver to be specific) with parallelism. I've tried using parMap to evaluate the next the potential moves and their costs in parallel. But this has only made my program slower. Is there something wrong with my approach?
 I'd also like to run the actual path finding recursion with all candidates (or the best two) at the same time but I've heard this isn't really possible due to the function returning an IO(). Is there anything I can do to make this part of the program go faster?
 Ideally I want something like this:
 for each state in possible_future_states: new thread(target=BFS, args=variables updated with this state being chosen) 
 Thank you for reading this. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

 I thought I'd solved this by (following some instructions at the bottom of this link) installing LLVM using homebrew and adding `/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin` to my path; in fact, I even seem to have one repo where it's working and another where it isn't, and I have absolutely no clue why. Can anyone offer any suggestions, or suggest other forums to ask?
 I note that opt is definitely in the path:  % which opt /opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/opt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have decided to spice up my holiday coding session consisting of nigths between 22/12-07/01 by swapping VIM for Emacs, so I have a couple questions.
 Premise for the setup; I'll start from vanilla Emacs and I aim to have a minimal set of packages enabling me to write some C/C++ with completion (lsp and/or deep stuff not necessary) and a nice (simple) way to browse project related files.
 Questions:
  
What packages do you recommend and why?
 Configuration recommendations/snippets?
 Keybindings you can't live without?
 Suggestions on good/must reads on the topic?
  
I've set up a repo containing some initial configuration which you can find here: https://codeberg.org/0xedd1e/dotfiles
 So far I've found Emacs to be really interesting and the package management seems superb (and easy). I also want to mention that I will not install evil-mode, at least not during this period.
 Ps. Not interested in an Emacs dist, I like keeping stuff clean and understandable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i tried to write a program with a gui and decided to use gloss to render it. But when i try to import the module, Graphics.Gloss it says it's not found. So then i tried to cabal install gloss but it outputs the following error message:
 cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library: * Missing (or bad) C library: GL This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that provides this library (you may need the "-dev" version). If the library is already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags --extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where it is.If the library file does exist, it may contain errors that are caught by the C compiler at the preprocessing stage. In this case you can re-run configure with the verbosity flag -v3 to see the error messages. cabal: Failed to build OpenGLRaw-3.3.4.1 (which is required by gloss-1.13.2.1). See the build log above for details. 
 So naturally i tried to install the library with cabal, OpenGlRaw but that gave the same error message except the gloss part. I tried to find information about this library but couldn't find anything useful for me, I am using nixos but the error appears on a secondary computer with fedora as well. I have opengl installed through my NixOS configuration and i have tried several c compilers or other openGL packages. This may not have to do with haskell but i assume i will get just as much help here as on r/NixOS 
 I am glad for anyone taking their time to help me.

 I am using the vscode css-language-server binary with eglot, and it's working great in css files, but when I open up sass files, it does not work with the current sass syntax that does not have braces or semi-colons. When I type the css-ls auto-completion does not work correctly, and syntax errors get thrown even though the syntax is correct and sass code compiles fine without any errors.
 Any tips on how to fix this issue?
 I'm guessing that sass-mode needs to get installed and configured with css-ls/eglot in use-package(my setup)?
 Thanks in advance for the help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to make the most of the excellent modus-themes (which are rather awe-inspiring in the rigor and attention to detail that as gone into them), but the more I investigate the more I realize I don't understand how to use themes or even the basics of how emacs handles colors and faces, much less themes.
 It started when I realized that Info-mode was presenting links with an illegibly bright cyan, which I realized was #00ffff. This is despite the fact that modus-themes supports info-mode, defines a cyan which is not that color, and I have no other theme loaded.
 So why was info-mode using the "wrong" cyan? Or do I need to take special steps to configure modus-themes to apply to info-mode?
 For that matter, how come I can't see modus-theme's cyan anywhere in the list shown by list-colors-display? And where do the other named and defined colors on that list come from?
 How do I even get the color of the character at point?
 I realize these are basic questions but I'd appreciate any pointers on how to understand this are better.

 I added and angular folder to the layers directory and added it into the loaded layers in .spacemacs config file.

 I use a basic org-capture template:
 (setq 
 org-capture-templates
 \(`
 ("t" "Task" entry (file "~/.config/emacs/journal/tasks.org")
 "* TODO %?\n\n %U\n %a\n %i" :empty-lines 1)
 ("i" "Idea" entry (file "~/.config/emacs/journal/ideas.org")
 "* IDEA %?\n\n %U\n %a\n %i" :empty-lines 1)
 ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/.config/emacs/journal/journal.org")
 "* %?\n %i\n")
 )
 )
 When I start the capture and select 'j' to create a Journal entry, my first line has 7 stars. This causes the entry to start too far to the right and it looks weird. I can't figure out why so many stars? Instead of 7, I expect maybe 4 stars:
 * Year
 ** Year-Month
 *** Year-Month-Day
 **** new journal entry goes here
 In an effort to learn elisp and try to fix the problem, I tried to modify org-datetree.el in the ~/.emacs/elpa/org-9.5.1 directory and recompile via emacs-lisp-recompile function after visiting the file. My modifications change the output (I removed tabs for example), but then it removes all of the dates! I don't want to mess too much with the el file as my configuration is getting to a nice stable state.
 Any ideas why so many stars? Thanks in advance for looking at this!

 I use Emacs for writing scientific texts in LaTeX, and so a spell checker/grammar checker is obviously important. I have yet to find a solution that I am happy with, so I would like to hear if anyone has some good suggestions.
 I have earlier used flyspell, but it falls short compared to Grammarly, LanguageTool and Trinka, as it only corrects words, and has no "contextual" understanding.
 I have tested lsp-ltex, which worded quite well, but I found it way too intrusive. Sure, I could probably have gotten it to work if i tinkered enough, but I feel like something so essential as a spell checker should be simple. For reference, below are two other threads related to this, but I did not find the answers there satisfactory; in particular I feel like many of the solutions are made for pure programming languages, and then bodged together to work with LaTeX.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! 
 I'm a regular Emacs user, testing the version 28 for some months ago (right now in 28.0.90). 
 Looking at the git repo and the devel mailing list, I was wondering if there are criteria/policies/requirements to declare a branch stable enough to be released. 
 The nearest example is, of course, Emacs 28, but I don't know if there are some guidelines for any future release (28.2, 29, etc). 
 Thanks.

 Title says it. Looking for a keyboard with relatively small space bar / more space for modifiers which can be pressed with thumbs.
 On my keyboard now with left thumb i can press comfortably first closest to space bar modifier, somewhat comfortably second closest to space modifier; with right thumb even first closest to space modifier is not comfortable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to figure what is done to figure out the searched symbol name when xref-find-definitions is called.
 The problem is the following. When I'm in org mode and in elisp source code block I try to use xref-find-definitions when my cursor is located on a string ";; `own-variable'". Then emacs says "no definitions found for "own-variable'". So it somehow falsely thinks that the final single quote is also part of a symbol name. How do I find what is being used to decide what's the searched symbol name?
 I tried profiling, and debug-on-entry for xref-find-definitions but that seems to be too late. The symbol name is already been made.
 I have an impression that Org mode uses "pcomplete-completions-at-point" for this completion but I did not manage to use debug-on-entry for that. I found the pcomplete-completions-at-point function by evaluating "completion-at-point-functions" in the buffer.
 Any tips would be welcome.
 EDIT: I'm able to jump to the definition with the following combination: M-x find-variable RET RET.

 I am currently an intern at a bank that's using Java and Spring for almost all of its backend services. My mentor tasked me to explore the basics of Scala for backend services so I'm here to ask for recommendations how one would build backend services as I've read around Scala doesn't depend as much on frameworks as Java does. 
 I've read on some 'frameworks' for Scala such as Play and Http4s, but the resources on those are quite scarce, and I've tried Http4s but I can't get my head to wrap around dependency management using sbt.
 Are there any recommendations you would give me for learning?
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running the following with stack script --resolver=ghc-9.0.1 works, but running with stack script --resolver=ghc-9.2.1 results in a stack overflow. Oddly, it works on ghc-9.2.1 compiling with -O2 but hangs when compiling with -O0.
 This behavior is surprising to me because, to my understanding, UndecidableSuperClasses carries the risk of infinite loops when type-checking, but at compile-time, it should concretize m and FooM m and the constraints should be erased. Is this not what happens? And did anything change in GHC 9.2 regarding UndecidableSuperClasses?
 I've also dumped out -ddump-tc for both -O2 and -O0, but I don't see any meaningful differences.
 Repro:
 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-} {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-} {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableSuperClasses #-} import Data.Kind (Type) class (Monad m, MonadFoo (FooM m)) => MonadFoo m where type FooM m :: Type -> Type runFoo :: FooM m a -> m a newtype MyMonad m a = MyMonad { runMyMonad :: m a } deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad) instance Monad m => MonadFoo (MyMonad m) where type FooM (MyMonad m) = MyMonad m runFoo = id main :: IO () main = runMyMonad foo foo :: MonadFoo m => m () foo = runFoo $ return () 
 Update: It seems reproducible with even main = runMyMonad $ runFoo $ return ()

 Where do you map all your extra commands to so you don't constantly fight with major-modes?
 EDIT: People pointed out that C-c LETTER is being saved for the user, which I misunderstood as it included other symbols as well. Thanks everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given a set of coins and an amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount.
 Note: a coin with a unit value is always assumed to exist in the given set of coins.
 Examples:
  
 Coins Amount min. no. of coins 
  
 {1,5,10,25} 1 1 
  {1,5,10,25} 4 4 
  {1,5,10,25} 5 1 
  {1,5,10,25} 6 2 
  {1,5,10,21,25} 63 3 
 
  
Say we are given a set of coins Cs = {1,5,10,21,25} and we want to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up 63, then the algorithm below essentially translates to the following:
  answer = min_coins(Cs, 63) = minimum ( min_coins(Cs, 62) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 58) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 53) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 42) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 38) + 1 ) 
 A direct haskell implementation of the above strategy is:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been a happy Gnus user for years. Recently, though, it was persuasively brought to my attention that threads are fundamental to how emails work, so I have introduced some redundancy to my system in order to make the threads work. Now I find myself conflicted about how to resolve these three constraints:
  
Make "sent" messages visible anywhere, as sometimes I use a different computer at a different location. For this, I've made an email account which has the sole purpose of receiving BCC of all emails I send, and so I subscribe to this SENT inbox to get those messages.
 
I use the GCC field to store a local version of my email upon sending, which has the advantage of storing the BCC recipients that are omitted from my SENT emails (especially useful when I send an "undisclosed recipients" email).
 
I wish to see things in both my Sent folder and in-thread in my usual inbox location. This is working except that I end up with duplicates of message I've sent. I expect one in my sent folder and another in my inbox, but I am receiving two in my inbox, and (gnus-summary-ignore-duplicates t) doesn't seem to make any noticeable difference, even though one of the messages I end up with in my inbox states "this is a duplicate".
 Any improvements or alternatives that meet the needs of synchronizing mail across machines, maintaining a "sent" box, and allowing email threading in my inbox?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working with lsp and company and found a very annoying feature that i would like to disable, when there is only one thing that can be suggested it is displayed like the image below, basically the word or symbol is "auto completed" on its own if i press tab if it is only a single suggestion. The problem is when i type too fast, for some reason this auto complete lags behind and actually affects the characters i input. So if i start typing sudo like below, if i am fast enough it will end up ignoring some of my input characters and i end up with suo or sdo sometimes. This placeholder is nice, to see but i dont want it to affect my actual keyboard input because it is slower than my type speed.

 EDIT: The issue did not seem to be related to the tooltip, nonetheless the answers below offer a perfectly good solution to replacing the tooltip with either nothing or the default company auto complete box (with only one suggestion). The problem was for some reason related to only typing the character "t" (for some reason) and the binding to (tab) i used to trigger auto complete in addition to enter (<return>). 
 (define-key company-active-map (kbd "tab") #'company-complete-selection) 
 This above was causing the character "t", when typed in the buffer while company was filtering, to somehow lose focus from the buffer and stop typing in it.
 (define-key company-active-map [tab] #'company-complete-selection) 
 This however works fine, and tab also does what it is supposed to be doing - completing the marked suggestion.

 I hope I am clear, but to add some clarification, while I am adding/editing the code in the package's implementation found in the installation, would there be a more efficient way to call this instead of editing the file here. 
 Example below -commented lines are the ones I have added in the original file- after updating the package they will be lost
 (defun sclang-switch-to-workspace () (interactive) (let ((buffer (get-buffer sclang-workspace-buffer))) (unless buffer (setq buffer (get-buffer-create sclang-workspace-buffer)) (with-current-buffer buffer (sclang-mode) (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (set-keymap-parent map sclang-mode-map) (sclang-fill-workspace-mode-map map) (use-local-map map)) (let ((line (concat "// " (make-string 69 ?=) "\n"))) (insert line) (insert "// SuperCollider Workspace \n") ;; (insert "// " (current-time-string) "\n") ;; (insert "// Ready to do thy Biding Master " (user-login-name) "\n") ;; (insert line) (insert "// using HTML Help: C-c C-h as usual, then switch to w3m buffer\n") (insert "// and do M-x sclang-minor-mode in order te enable sclang code execution\n") (insert line) (insert "\n")) (set-buffer-modified-p nil) cwd to sclang-runtime-directory (if (and sclang-runtime-directory (file-directory-p sclang-runtime-directory)) (setq default-directory sclang-runtime-directory)))) (switch-to-buffer buffer)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am in a dilemma. I have switched to a new job, now in my previous role I was working as a data engineer (scala and spark) and in the new role they want to put me in a team which deals with data processing (scala, spark, Kafka, akka streams, samza) but there is another team which deals with rest api development (scala, akka http, grpc, cats). I can choose where I want to be but this is where I am not able to make a decision. They have also told me that in future if I feel like the type of work I am doing is not for me then I can ask for change. Just want your inputs.

 The issue is back-links won't show up in my org-roam buffer.
 This is my config:
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") t) (setq org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/org-roam")) (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) (require 'org-roam) (org-roam-setup) 
 I have installed org-roam, and org-roam--sqlite-available-p is set to t.
 I created the nodes with org-roam-node-insert and can follow the links just fine with org-open-at-point.
 You can see my org-roam folder here (and my config file is in there too).
 https://github.com/thread314/org-roam-troubleshoot
 I've deleted my .emacs.d folder and run emacs -Q, same result. I've even tried it on a completely fresh virtual machine, backlinks still won't show up.
 I am running Emacs 27.2, Org 9.4.4 and Org-Roam 2.1.0.
 I have tried asking for help on the org-roam discourse and on the org-roam slack, no luck with either.
 I must be doing something wrong, but I just can't figure out what. Can anyone help?
 I'd be happy to make a donation of $200 AUD to a charity of your choosing if you can help me with this (if that helps sweeten the pot).

 The problem is that Handler cannot derive MonadUnliftIO as it's a newtype over ExceptT ServerError IO a, which does not have an instance for it.
 In order to get derive an instance, here's a possible solution: ```haskell {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been going through the University of Finland MOOC course on haskell, and this example popped up:
 ​
 someLetters :: Gen String someLetters = do c <- elements "xyzw" n <- choose (1,10) return (replicate n c) *Examples.QuickCheck> sample someLetters "yyyyyyyy" "zzzzzzzzz" "xxxxxxxxx" "yyyyyyy" "yyy" "ww" "xxxxxx" "yyy" "yyyyyyy" "xxxxxxxxxx" "y" 
 My question is how is this 'someletters' fn a pure fn? It will always return a List of strings, but the strings will always be different. If it was modified to pass in a starting string, it would still produce a list of random length strings, so the even if the parameter is the same, the results will be different almost all of the time.
 Or is it not a pure fn, and is it then fairly easy to write non-pure functions in Haskell?
 TIA

 I am looking to solve the following problem. I am using org-agenda to view items marked as TODO. This presents a list. The list is long and it's a bit difficult to scan. Ideally, I would like to have an interface where only the first item would load, I would hit "n" and then the next and the next and so on until there are no items left.
 Is this possible to do? What are the steps to take to achieve this?
 Thanks very much!

 The manual on images seems to be very basic.

 Should I always prepare them beforehand to have a consistent look (e.g. to have the same width through all the notes)?

 Here's the repo (not in Melpa): https://github.com/dantecatalfamo/agenda-html

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! :)
 I wanted to share a package that I have developed. This package makes it possible to run, and interact, with shell commands that are run completely detached from Emacs. The name of the package comes from dtach, which is the program that makes this package possible. 
 As a user you start shell commands in dedicated sessions using dtache. Here is a list of some of the features that these sessions offer:
 - The user have access to all of the output from a session
 - The user gets a notification when a session has finished
 - Sessions are automatically labeled success or failure
 - Sessions can be started on remote hosts
 - The user can easily rerun a session
 - Sessions can be opened in a compile mode, which effectively makes it mimics M-x compile
 For a more thorough walk through of the package, and how to use it, you can watch this video which I have created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if1W58SrClk
 And the package itself you can find at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache
