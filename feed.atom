 His PPA seems to be the one suggested in every "how to install Emacs" guide. Is there a fork or recommended alternative that is maintained?

I'd like to replicate what they do but in vanilla emacs, but am having trouble following and understanding what exactly is going on in his org file. Are there other resources which explain this and are geared more towards beginners?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got a message from Tarsius because I'm sponsoring him. This is what it says:
 "Recently GitHub announced that GitHub Sponsors is going to abruptly stop accepting PayPal payments on February 23, 2023.
 "In the three days since, I have already lost a dozen sponsors. If this continues at this rate, I am going to loose over half my sponsors on this platform.
 "This is a huge issue for me. These donations are not just a nice extra but how I make a living. I already have to get by with an income that is way below minimal wage, so losing sponsors in great numbers really hurts. I receive about 80% of all donations through Github Sponsors, losing between 50% and 75% of that, would mean I cannot pay my bills anymore.
 "If you are currently using PayPal, then please take some time to switch to another payment method, either here on GitHub, or by using one of the many other options donation options."
  
My personal opinion as a professional developer and one among many donators is that I couldn't survive my work without the help of Magit. It allows me to be really effective and to find new Git tricks.
 If you are using Paypal as a payment method in Github, please switch to another way of donating. And if you're not donating, this would be a great time to start.
 Donate to Magit!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I watched a talk by Tony Buzan at Poland's SWPS University, which I came across on YouTube, reminding me of the importance of colour in understanding and recall.
Whilst at school several decades ago, I became very keen on Tony Buzan's methods popularised by his 1974 BBC television series Use Your Head, in which he encouraged people to use colourful mindmaps and speedreading, among other techniques, to better understand and remember anything they were studying.  At the time, I was a failing student.  So, even though most students and staff saw his techniques as weird, I decided to give them ago.  To my astonishment, by applying just a couple of his key techniques, I quickly started getting top marks and with less effort.  So, I have no doubt Tony's methods have merit.
It would therefore be beneficial to introduce coloured text into The Archive app by using some simple markup code.
Even a limited pallet would be helpful, perhaps just red, green and blue, although the more colours, the better.  Something like <r>for red text</r>, <b>for blue text</b>, etc., would be enough.  But hex codes would allow for a more extensive pallet.
Would coloured text in The Archive app be possible?
Tony Buzan's talk at SWPS University can be seen here:  https://youtu.be/QEokHNWf-Qg.
And his 1974 BBC television series Use Your Head, is available here: https://youtu.be/EgG8GuQHHIs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, the use-package documentation says that we should use the :init keyword to execute code before the package is loaded. In the use-package documentation, those are usually variables set before the package is loaded, but can be functions to enable a certain mode as well.
 However, I've noticed for example on the Vertico GitHub page, vertico-mode is enabled in :init but it works perfectly fine when enabled in :config as well. The package is not deferred so I don't see a reason to put vertico-mode within :init.
 There are situations when using :init makes sense because the package is deferred. For example :bind automatically defers a package.
 (use-package ef-themes :init (load-theme 'ef-summer t) :bind ("<f9>" . ef-themes-select)) 
 If I wouldn't use :init in this situation, the theme wouldn't load until F9 is pressed.
 Please correct me if I'm wrong. Also, is it true that overusing :init can cause Emacs to start a little slower? I've seen it mentioned by someone here on Reddit, but I don't have the link anymore.

One thing I was interested in was defining custom indentation for an "algorithm" special block. The idea would be to define a list of keywords that, if typed within a block, that after pressing Enter on that each subsequent line the cursor would be indented until the an end keyword is reached at which point the indentation would stop. I know of psedudocode-mode (although I do not know if this can be used in an org file), but the idea would be to do something similar to that. Any guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.

 I made a highlighting tool, so I can more comfortably emphazise text in org-mode. I wanted to have this functionality when I started using org-mode and finally came across a way to implement it.

 The functionality has been realised with a slightly modified version of org-extra-emphasise to use less intrucive emphasize symbols then in the unmodified version and hydra to get the pop up menu.

 In my humble opinion, the design of NANO Emacs by u/Nicolas-Rougier is probably the best one out there. However, I could never really use NANO Emacs because I require Doom Emacs, which, on the other hand, has the best configuration framework :)
 Hence, I decided to port the NANO modeline and themes for Doom Emacs. The former is adapted to display information about the Evil state. The latter uses the Doom themes framework, making everything work out-of-the-box in Doom Emacs.
 If you want to try, those are the repository:
 https://github.com/ronisbr/doom-nano-themes
 https://github.com/ronisbr/doom-nano-modeline
 These are works in progress and probably have many bugs and inconsistencies.

 A few weeks back I wrote a blog post about my initial ideas for a Haskell persistence layer that uses generics.
 I got positive feedback and some very useful hints. In the meantime, I have been busy and have been able to implement almost all of the suggestions.
 Of course the library is still in an early stage of development. But all test cases are green and it should be ready for early adopters use. 
 Several things are still missing:
  
A query language
 Handling auto-incrementing primary keys
 coding free support for 1:1 and 1:n relationships (using more generics magic)
 schema migration
 ...
  
Feature requests, feedback and pull requests are most welcome!
 The library is available on Hackage:
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-persistence

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I'm really, really excited to announce the release of Ogma 1.0.7!
 Ogma is a NASA tool that facilitates integrating runtime monitors or runtime verification applications into other systems. Ogma extends Copilot [1], a high-level runtime verification framework that generates hard real-time code.
 In spite of the small increase in the version number, the feature included in this version is big: we now generate monitors for Robot Operating System (ROS 2) applications.
 Use cases supported by Ogma also include generating monitors directly from requirements specified using a structure natural language framework, and producing NASA Core Flight System (cFS) monitoring applications.
 For more details, including videos of monitors being generated and flown in simulators, see: https://github.com/nasa/ogma
 Monitors generated from natural-language requirements using Ogma, running inside X-Plane Flight simulator.
 Releases
 Ogma is released as a collection of packages in Hackage. The entry point is https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ogma-cli.
 Code
 The github repo is located at: https://github.com/nasa/ogma.
 What's coming
 The next release is planned for March 21st, 2023.
 Ogma is currently undergoing the qualification process necessary for NASA Class D Software. Apart from the changes required by that process, we also have the following in our roadmap:
  
Extend ROS 2 monitors with further information about sources of violations.
 Add tests to generated code.
 Simplify NASA cFS monitor generation process.
  
Happy Haskelling!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Org-attach is very useful for embedding images and other files into org headings, especially with the ID flavor, which makes attachment painless. But the hard-coded attachment directory locations creates the real potential for the links to go stale. I think a couple of small additions would go a long way towards hardening org-attach against eventual "stale ID link syndrome": 
  
It would be very useful to be able to specify the org-attach-id-dir as a file-level setting, ala #+ATTACH-ID-DIR or similar. This would allow you to keep "separate stores" of id-based attachments, so you could move them around. You could do this with a relative path for org-attach-id-dir (though see below), but maybe for some documents you want all their attachments in a fixed location (e.g. ~/org/.attachments) but for others you want them "packaged together" for portability. Maybe this is already possible? The org docs don't seem to have a single place documenting all the #+CONFIG: val settings that can appear at the top of the file. 
 
Another related wish which I don't think is yet possible: an option to set org-attach-id-dir based on a locate-dominating-file search. So you could have a structure as below, and all the note's attachments would be stored and live in the top .attachments/ directory. Then you could happily move portable_dir around, send it to colleagues, etc., and attachment links would never go stale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have tried to shift a chunk of my online media consumption to elfeed, so that I can quickly check out blog posts, webcomics, arXiv papers, podcasts and YouTube videos. However, this has meant that updating my feeds has become quite resource intensive, and runs for a few minutes.
  
 My current setup involves 60+ feeds, 20 of which are podcasts and 10 of which are YouTube channels and playlists.
 Playing around with my settings, I now use 
  (elfeed-set-timeout 90) (setq url-queue-timeout 5) (setq elfeed-curl-max-connections 8) 
 and elfeed-search-fetch takes about 5 minutes to run, at about 25% CPU usage across my 4-core i7. I've have the elfeed timeout at 90 seconds as otherwise some feeds simply time out when I try to update them.
 Is there anyway to speed this up, or do I just have far too many feeds (some of which only update e.g. every month)?
  
 One course of action I do is to go to a particular filter setting (which I have stored as a bookmark and access via a shortcut) and do elfeed-search-fetch-visible. I do this for feeds tagged as podcasts for instance, which I check more often than blog posts.
 An alternative that I haven't started working on yet is to write something that updates some subset of feeds. I use elfeed-org to manage my list of feeds and their tags, so perhaps there's an elegant solution that ties that package into a new fetch function.

 Usecase: I wanted to take the contents of description lists in a consistent format, have them export normally and use an export filter to parse up the list's content for input into a program. After trying numerous export filters (https://orgmode.org/manual/Advanced-Export-Configuration.html), the common ones weren't satisfying as they lost formatting on export or would've caused me to write a significantly more error-prone filter than I wanted.
 The solution: wrap each section in a special block (https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-blocks-in-LaTeX-export.html) so you keep formatting and can group all the text together.
 Relevant aside: my usecase would've been trivial if either of orgmode supported either of the following:
  
multiline table cells in the default table type.
 a way to feed table.el tables to src blocks as a parameter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've sadly hit a snag in my collaborating-with-Word-users-while-staying-inside-org workflow.
 I have been exporting an org-mode manuscript via `ox-pandoc` with good results, but now I need to produce Word 'comments' from my org source. Pandoc understands these comments, so running pandoc on a `markdown` buffer using HTML syntax like this works
 <span class="comment-start" id="3" author="jdm204" date="NOW">comment</span> This is the text that is commented on. <span class="comment-end" id=3"></span> 
 but the same syntax in an org document naturally just inserts the HTML source into the document.
 I've also tried `#+begin_export pandoc` block, but that also just inserts the raw source. 
 It seems like pandoc needs something that it understands as org syntax but I'm stumped.
 Does anyone have any idea if or how this could be achieved?

 I do all my development in a directory that I've named, unsuspringly, /Idevelopment.
 On some of my computers, this might be symlinked to another directory that I may have, say, on a zfs drive. 
 Problem is, Emacs changes the symlink to the canonical form, so when I pull the configuration to another computer, it goes to the wrong place!
 How do I tell Emacs to retain the paths as they are and not go to the canonical versions? After all, I put thoes symlinks there for a reason!

 I read a book and it has examples in Pascal, thus I want to create Pascal snippets.
 Installed FreePascal and it seems like Emacs has a pascal-mode but there is no babel function for it.
 So when I have
 #+begin_src pascal
 #+end_src
 It will not work.
 Any idea? It seems like one has to define the org-babel stuff to trigger the pascal compilation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently I am using org roam to manage my knowledge base and add notes from my laptop. But I am now thinking of transitioning my note taking on a tablet or iPad where I can type and draw to take notes. But unfortunately I can't use emacs on this and converting my notes is also a hassle. I was looking at other posts comparing emacs to obsidian and logseq, but they always go on tangents and talk about how emacs can do so much more rather than simply focusing on the note taking aspect between emacs and the other applications. So I am uncertain about emacs capabilities just for note taking with tablets and iPads. I was wondering if anyone uses a tablet for their note taking and how they integrate it quickly into their org roam? Or is this best left for obsidian which has an app on the tablet?
 Currently I'm thinking I take notes in obsidian in tablet/iPad which automatically syncs to my computer where I have a script running to convert it to org. This seems like the fastest and most efficient way of doing things

 Calling list-packages and installing org manually from there solves the problem. Any ideas on how to make use-package install the gnu elpa version automatically?

Those urls often had webpack:// in front.
 I use to copy the path and edit it to open in Emacs. With this code You can just copy and press C-c C-f if the previous file shares a path.

Vertico and icomplete-vertical seem very similar on the surface: they both give a vertical completion system that uses Emacs's built-in completing-read, meaning they are both compatible with things like Marginalia and Orderless. icomplete-vertical ships with Emacs, while Vertico is a third-party package. So my question is: why would I use Vertico instead of icomplete-vertical, when they seem to offer basically the same features?

 The awesome part is that building buffers out of an easy-to-select storage (something MANY hate in this community) is damn effective: text is easy to read but not easy to combine on the fly and that's an issue no files&dirs text tools can solve, org-ql, org-transclusion are excellent examples of very good tools who can't give the same outcome of spit out text from a backend DB.
 The not-so-exiting part is that while notes can be org-mode, they are not actually real org-mode, yes, they got rendered, but I still can't manage attachments properly, use a drawer as in org-mode and so on.
 My dream? Simply a note-taking solution that allow FULL Emacs/org-mode features but out of a flexible solution that allow dynamic result buffers out of queries, like notmuch/mu for emails, like ekg for notes and so on, because while text is super flexible is still also limiting in some aspects.
 The purpose of this post is reiterate this long running not so accepted but definitively felt topic on notes seeing the regular evolution of tools who try to be kind-of query-driven (like search&narrow vs menus/taxonomies) and periodically fail to complete the game. I hope a day enough people would accept such storage concept and we will finally see an Emacs-based storage who is actually a kind of DB directly managed in Emacs, with of the flexibility of a DB and the power of elisp. Oh, and I hope to be clear in this quick description as well!

 speedbar-find-file 
 function of speedbar. How to modfiy it to allow opening the new buffer in the PREVIOUS ACTIVE Frame and not the frame speedbar was started from?
 I know how to keep in variable last visited frame, excluding the speedbar frame.
 (defvar my-recent-frames nil)
 ​
 (defun my-frame-record-selected ()
 "Record the currently selected frame. Add this to the focus-in-hook."
 (let ((f (selected-frame)))
 (if (not (string= (frame-parameter f 'name) "Speedbar"))

 "Jump to most recently active frame before the current frame."
 (interactive)
 (unless (null my-recent-frames)
 (select-frame-set-input-focus my-recent-frames)))
 ​
 ​
 Problem is: where to put the frame restoration code WITHOUT damaging the existing code mechanism.
 ​
 (defun speedbar-find-file (text _token indent)
 "Speedbar click handler for filenames.
 TEXT, the file will be displayed in the attached frame.
 TOKEN is unused, but required by the click handler. INDENT is the

 I would like to believe it is safe as it is under a reputed repo which is emacs-tree-sitter which recently had tree-sitter merged into main line emacs. 
 Is they any particular reason it is not on public package repos?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a moment ago, I was working on some statistics homework. And it was all just boring rote confidence interval calculations. Mostly busy work. After doing about two problems, I wasn't satisfied with the pace at which I was completing the homework, so I fired up GHCi in my terminal. In theory, what I am describing here can be done with any language with a REPL, but Haskell's syntax makes for extremely fast prototyping (in my opinion).
 First I created a function that would map some common confidence intervals to it's corresponding z-score. I.e. 0.9 -> 1.645. Took 10 seconds.
 Next I created a function that would take some sample mean as an argument, number of samples, and variance as an argument and it would return a function which, when given a z-score, will return a tuple that represents my confidence interval. 
 Next, plug and chug. A homework that could have taken me an hour and a half took me 15 minutes. Next step is to integrate it with LaTeX so it will automatically write out the answers for me :) 
 Maybe this is a trivial example but I was just really impressed with the ease and speed with which I could quickly slap together a "custom" calculator and start plugging in the values I care about.

 -> I use Emacs Doom, version GNU 28.2 in MacOS Ventura 13.2.1. emacs-mac variant installed in it.
 I've worked a lot with Emacs, with a lot of workflows and all, and right now, this is my current workflow with org-mode:
 ​
 - When I get a task, I create an outline with the task description, as well as the timestamp of its creation.
 - I then work into a small description and some checklists - [ ] that I need to work on.
 - Most of my work is remote, and even so, through a middleware server. I use shell sessions for this, which may have some downsides as some garbage string in the result, but usually work pretty fast. Normally I would:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in the process of configuring Emacs as my daily driver and love org-mode so far!One of the most important tasks for me is creating LaTeX documents (reports, papers, exercise sheets, proposals, ...)I like how literate programming works for my Sage worksheets and would like to also incorporate it into my document writing with LaTeX for boosting the org-component of creating such documents.
 Obviously (at least for me as a layman), I want to have multiple LaTeX codeblocks, say for different sections of my document. My first codeblock contains the header and a \begin{document}. However, when I do not write \end{document} into the same codeblock, Emacs appears to not accept the codeblocks end #+end_src and throws an error on running org-babel-tangle. If I include an additional \end{document} in the first codeblock, all LaTeX codeblocks in my orgfile are recognised as such on tangling and correctly exported. Then, however, I have to go into the generated TeX-file and delete the superfluous \end{document} from the export of the first block manually. That does not feel right.
 Is there an elegant solution to that problem? In particular, how may I allow a codeblock to be exported properly by org-babel-tangle, even if it contains environments that are not properly closed in the same codeblock?
 PS: As far as I understood from a simple web search, org-export does not deliver what I want without additional setup, as I basically want to write a LaTeX file and manage the org stuff around it without exporting it.

 These fib implementations come from a 2010 mailing list: https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2010-October/084538.html.

 But when I try to add a filter using match or exclude-tags, it doesn't create the table, and instead shows the column view as if calling org-columns on the entire file.

 What's funny is that it was working before, and I have a filtered table, but now it doesn't want to function properly. 
 Any advice?
 EDIT:
 Looks like this bit +DEADLINE={.+}+SCHEDULED={.+} is the cause of the issue.
 Anyone knows how to achieve this filter?

 I'm working on this, because it seems somewhat trivial. Initial feedback, obviously, has been negative, and I guess the package needs a parser to convert existing .hs files to use the clearly idiom instead.
 ​
 The intended use is to make Haskell readable for newbies, when I think everyone reading this is at the level wherein, excepting maybe `timesDo`, none of the functions are necessary.
 ​
 
 ​
 And to be totally honest, this is 100% a clone of Flow, taylorfausak's extremely popular (sarcasm) operator library, except deliberately using semi-verbose function names instead with declarative programming / readability being the aim.

Thought for the week
In the classic Greek sense, we should make more time in our lives for leisure. Slow productivity is a combination of incremental work and tangential work. It is incremental because it is made of micro-actions accumulating over time. Tangential, in the sense that it sometimes is work or play that seems unrelated but actually moves the needle forward. A walk in the woods might be an example of tangential productivity.
Writing has taken priority. My course assignment is to write a creative non-fiction essay modeled after the works we discussed in class. My Zk has been a joyous and surprising resource for ideas. I'm using my ZK by creating search queries and using the highlighting feature to find where I've already written answers to the query in my own voice. They become snippets directly into my essay. In a sense, I've already written my essay. I just have to find all the pieces and put them together. In truth, this is only a first draft and still needs work.
What I've found to be key steps to creating a rough draft.
—
My review routine has again surfaced something wonderful in my ZK. I had no idea I was curating ideas on the value of practice. I started a secondary hub with 18 entries, hung off of the main hub titled The Art Of Living A Good Life [[202105102006]]. 

  
Basic learning preps. What am I doing that is practice? How else do I expect to improve unless I practice? The best continue practicing even after achieving success to push themselves, not become complacent, and reach new heights. Practice Different - by Stephen Vafier - Carolina Stories

 ​
 ```
 A monad in programming is made up of three parts, also known as the three laws of monads:
  
Unit (also known as "return" or "pure"): This is the function that wraps a value into a monadic context. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy who rounds up a calf and brings it into the corral.
 Bind (also known as "flatMap" or "chain"): This is the function that applies a function to a monad and returns a new monad. It allows you to chain operations on the monad. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy who takes a calf from the corral to the branding iron, then from the branding iron to the castrator, and so on.
 Associativity: This is the law that says the order in which you chain the operations with the bind function should not matter. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy code that says you should always ride in the direction of your destination, no matter what order you do your chores in.
  
Together, these three parts make up the monad. In cowboy terms, you might think of it like a group of cowboys who work together to round up and process cattle. Each cowboy has a specific job to do, and they follow a set of rules to make sure they get the job done right.

 I was watching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQYsFshbkYw

 Is there a way to have something like this in Emacs too?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just to get this out of the way, this is obviously not a criticism in any facet, I know people develop org-roam, and much else, in their free time. It is what it is, in any case. But before I consider using the software, I want to get a realistic idea of what's going on in a descriptive sense, without judgement. It seems on a superficial view that the project has slowed down quite significantly. The latest release was in April of 2022, currently open bugs seem to be fixed or even considered at a very slow pace, whereas in the past a lot of bugs have been closed swiftly.
 Has org-roam simply reached a state of maturity, where the main functionality works fine and is stable, such that everything else is either details or some minor stuff that's hard to fix? Or has development and improvement stalled involuntarily because the maintainers don't have a lot of free time to put into the project? Any insight is welcome.

 All the advanced and experimental features are now hidden behind the --power launcher option, as was already the case for the scala distribution for a while. This includes things like package, publish and others. So to package something, you'll now have to :
 scala-cli --power package . 
 Of course, the power mode can also be set globally.
 scala-cli config power true 
 Other notable changes include:
  
support for script inputs with no file extension via the shebang sub-command
 support for JSON exports of project configuration
 dropping ammonite imports syntax
 improving the readability of individual sub-commands' --help and --full-help outputs
 and more, refer to the release notes for details

 Apparently this course lectures are "published" every week since the 30th January 2023 and will end up with 17 Lectures (currently 8 are available)
 This course was already completely available in 2021 and 2022.
 But every year he removes the videos "I'll be releasing the videos week by week as my class for Nottingham students progresses. They are the same videos as previously with some minor updates."
 The YouTube videos are either one or two years old so i just think he unlists them. Even the lectures slides are already available A few people had the same problem last year So I wanted to ask if someone knows where the lectures are still hosted? I really prefer this course over the other introduction resources, but I only have the next week off so I want to watch them soon.

To obviate this problem I have to go back and copy directly to the register. This has been a long standing problem for me in Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I've recently tried out Emacs and enjoyed it a lot, but I can't seem to get my color scheme working, no matter the many different methods I use.Before, in Vim, I set it to use my terminal(st) colors, and I was very happy with that. A picture of what a .cpp file looks like is below.
 https://i.imgur.com/C3R6Ikv.png
 I use Emacs Gui mode, and I was looking to use these terminal colors, but I can't find a way to port the Vim colors over(even though they are terminal colors). I've tried creating my own Emacs color scheme(using autothemer), but the lack of faces for some things prevent me from fully creating the theme, and my lack of knowledge about Emacs Lisp is hindering me as well.
 I'm not sure how st(suckless terminal) and/or Vim uses the colors specified in the st config, but I think it is Xresources-related. Below is a picture of the 16 colors I use in my st config.
 I am considering porting this over to Vim(as these seem to be somewhat general) and then to Emacs, but again, I have no idea how these colors are used and applied.
 https://i.imgur.com/FAEcuer.png
 (I can't remember when I made the theme, but I believe it was based on something online, but I'm not sure how prevalent it is)
 In the end, any pointers on how to implement this theme in Emacs or anything about the way st uses these colors will help greatly(or any other places I should cross-post this in). Once I figure out how to use this color scheme in Emacs in beyond, I plan on releasing it or such, as I think many might find it interesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious about using org-mode for language learning (currently working on Spanish, German, and French). Particularly, I'm trying to build up vocabulary as well as try my hand at reading / translating.
 In the past, when I was translating, I worked in a cryptpad and just wrote the translation in another text color and then went back to make corrections in yet another color. It was pretty time consuming. I've used org-remark for annotations on text and think it would be a good tool for this purpose. But maybe others have experience and suggestions for other tools or workflows.
 As for vocabulary, I think I'd like to do spaced repetition flashcards. I had used Anki for awhile, but it eventually got overwhelming. I couldn't really make a habit out of it.
 I haven't used any flashcard tools in org yet. Preferably I'd like something easy to use. I'm also wondering how to get vocab lists into org. It might be educational to do it by hand but I would prefer an automated solution, especially since I'm looking for "top 1000+ common words" lists. For example, taking an Anki set and converting to org. 
 Any suggestions and tips are appreciated.

Just "Vertico" doesn't tell the whole story, while "Vertico + Orderless + Embark + Consult + Marginalia" is quite a mouthful.
 For example the way this question is phrased, the technically correct the answer would be "little to none". Vertico itself offers no feature parity with the aforementioned alternatives. The answer the OP actually expects is about the advantages of the whole stack, but that increases the friction as it requires convincing everyone interested that each part of the stack is worthwhile (and often just plainly needed), even though originally they only planned on using Vertico.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assuming there is no way to configure a bidirectional sync with external softwares like rclone, would it be possible to access remote files using TRAMP but also guarantee some functionalities when the device is offline? 
 For example: the device is offline but I asked to access a file on a WebDAV server. Emacs already showed me that file previously so it shows me a cached copy of that file.
 Another example for writing: I'd like to write on a file using TRAMP. The device is offline, so Emacs will store this modified file for later and save it whenever it is possible.
 This is basically synchronization but done on Emacs, i guess. Is it possible?
 EDIT: Logseq, a famous notetaking app, has implemented an interesting sync mechanism that tells you if a file has been synced or not. Can someone like this be made in Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been an org-mode as my organisation tool, and emacs as my "OS" as a "beginner" for 2+ years. I happily use Org to do some GTD-alike organisation, and to collect my thoughts on topics in Org-Roam.
 **tldr;** I'm trying to dynamically generate org-headings for each (new) subdir of a directory. I think a shell script is the best way to achieve this (so it can run independently of an open emacs session) - but may be wrong. In any event I don't script very often and am very confused.
 *What I'm trying to do:*
 I edit video for fun. 
 I use syncthing to sync my scratch (editing) folder and my org-files across two machines:
  
my old i7 machine (effects and rendering); and 
 my dual boot surface go (basic and on-the-go editing, footage ingestion etc).
  
I work on my org-files in DooM emacs on those machines and orgzly / logseq (for roam) on my android phone (occasionally using termux too, but not if I can help it).
 My video editing software creates a folder for each video project. As a result I have a folder structure like `~/scratch/live_projects/video_X`
 I'm getting to the stage where I need to use notes in org-mode to keep track of various aspects of videos (scripts, b-roll, assets etc).
 It would be lovely if each time I create a project (and a directory is generated) it would pop a heading into my org-file where I could keep notes. 
 *What I've done so far:*
 I've managed to manipulate an org-file checklist using shell scripting in Tasker (on my phone). Mostly just checking / unchecking boxes via a menu. E.g. using sed to replace `/]` with `X]`.
 I'm struggling to google how to interact with directories in bash:
  
When I google the answer to this as keywords Org and Directory together get me lots of hits. 
 Maybe I need a better boolean search fu - but that is a different question.
 
 I also use fish, so when I test I hit `$(...) is not supported`. 
  
So as you can see, not much progress has been made.
 Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I started to transcribe my mother's old recipes written on 3×5" note cards into a digital format. Portability is important to me, as I wanted to be able to send them to friends and family and not have to worry about apps needed to view them. I initially opted to write them in Markdown. Then I became an Emacs user. 🤩 I like the idea of being able to write the recipes in org files and exporting to whatever format convenient for family, like perhaps PDF. Hosting a little website for them might be a neat project for a future date.
 ​
 I installed org-chef, but as far as I can tell, it's meant for scraping recipes from websites. I don't need functionality to adjust proportions, either. Being able to generate a shopping list might be useful someday, but it's not currently something I need to do. I've written a few recipe files in org-mode, but I'm not sure if this is the mode I should be using. I also experimented with using markdown-mode, but wouldn't it be better to write in another mode and export to Markdown? I'd prefer to have the recipes in separate files, rather than one big file, but I'm open to good reasons why I might not want to do that.
 ​
 I'm currently writing them with a few keywords and some tags for metadata. I searched a lot online, here on reddit, as well as asked ChatGPT (it worked well till it gave me a bunch of what seems to be incorrect advice 🫠), about how to create a basic template, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do it on my own. I'm currently using a file that I fill my stuff into and then save with a new name. That works well enough, but it seems to me like there'd be a more elegant way to do it.
 ​
 So, that's where I'm at. Part of me is starting to wonder if I should instead try to learn some database software for this... Though I really only want to be able to search for titles and basic tags, so a database sounds like overkill. Any advice and direction pointing is appreciated.

 I would like to share with you my humble project - library for creating and managing tray icons Emacs-Appindicator.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/yn9vdccnqkja1.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=b90dfa4f2e477d10b79ec7751d0a8a8e430e9217
 ​
 You can hide/show icons, labels, create context menus with lisp callbacks for each menu item. The library uses svg-lib so you can use icons from various online collections supported by it. Under the hood it has tiny daemon, written in C that interacts with system tray via libappindicator. So, at least for now, the only supported OS is Linux.
 I planned to keep minor modes in separate repo - Emacs Appindicator Modes. For now there is only icon for pomm.el , but I plan to add more useful packages soon.
 I will be glad to hear your thoughts about package. Also I suppose it is the good time to change something in api, so if you have any idea - please share it!

 I want to use some of my org-roam files like a “database” (not in the strict sense), to keep some metadata about my files. 
 In this spirit, I want to save in the PROPERTIES drawer some information, which I want to put it in a table. My idea is to do the same process with several files and copy/paste those small tables into another (a large one) with all this information. 
 The problem with this approach is the visibility and navigation around the tables. 
 This example

 What I have tried:
  
open the submodule transient with o
 specify the --recursive infix with r
 sync all submodules with c-u s
 init all submodules with c-u p
 update all submodules with c-u u
  
This effectively does the same as the git submodule update --init --recursive, but requires 3 separate commands, each with a prefix argument.
 I'm looking for a way to create another entry in the submodule transient (under the "All modules actions" section) to run git submodule update --init --recursive. If that can't be done, is there a way to more easily run all three commands (sync, init, update)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! 
 I'm a beginner in emacs configuration. Please excuse me if the answer here is obvious, but I am unable to find the solution online :/ I am having trouble configuring org-roam-dailies. I want each daily note to be pre-populated with the contents of a template file. My current configuration is as follows: 
 ```elisp
 (defun note-path (subpath) (let ((note-directory "/Users/<MY_USERNAME>/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/notes")) (file-truename (concat note-directory subpath))))
 (defun org-template (filename) (note-path (concat "/templates/" filename)))
 (use-package org :ensure t)
 (use-package org-roam :ensure t :config (setq org-roam-db-update-on-save t) (setq org-roam-directory (note-path "/")) (setq org-roam-dailies-directory "") (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates '(("d" "default" entry (org-template "daily-note.org") :target (file+head "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n")))))
 ```
 My issue specifically is with the last statement: setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates. I expect this to read the content of daily-note.org and create a new note with this as the content. However, it simply creates an empty note. I have ensured that the value of (org-template "daily-note.org") is correct; substituting it for an absolute path (e.g. ~/test.org) behaves the same way. 
 Are any of you kind people able to see where I'm misunderstanding?
 EDIT: fixed code formatting

 From my experiments it seems to have to do with the filename. I have a bunch of identical files containing some c++ code:
 [~] $ cat importfromdesktop.cpp #include <iostream> int main() { return 0; } [~] $ md5sum *.cpp 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromdesktop.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromdeskto.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromdesk.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromd.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfrom.cpp # WORKS! 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfro.cpp # WORKS! 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfr.cpp # WORKS! 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 fromdesktop.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 verylongfilenamehereman.cpp # WORKS! 
 When opening the first importfromdesktop.cpp, c++-mode is not started (this was the original filename that was problematic, when I copied the file's contents to a main.cpp it worked, so I started testing the filename).
 I kept removing a letter from the end and starting from importfrom.cpp, c++-mode would engage. So I thought maybe it has to do with the filename length? But testing doesn't show that either.
 Nothing different shows in the messages buffer in all these cases. How do I debug this?
 Thanks!

 I use Helm. I would like to understand if I should make the switch to Vertico. What does Vertico do better than Helm or Ivy?
 And is Ivy even worth trying out at this point or should I just jump straight to Vertico?

 Neorg (Neo - new, org - organization) - https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg
 Its description says it's a is a Neovim plugin designed to reimagine organization as you know it. Grab some coffee, start writing some notes, let your editor handle the rest. 
 The first point of its philosophy is to
  
 Revise the org format: simple, extensible, unambiguous. Will make you feel right at home. Alternate markup formats have several flaws, but the most notable one is the requirement for complex and slow parsers. What if we told you it's possible to alleviate those problems, all whilst keeping that familiar feel? Enter the .norg file format, whose specification can be found here. The cross between all the best things from org and the best things from markdown, revised and merged into one.

 I've implemented a small prototype of type-safe remote hot-code swapping using Arrow-based (or more accurately, Cartesian-category-based) state machines of type input -> state -> (state, output):
 https://github.com/stevana/hot-swapping-state-machines#hot-swapping-state-machines
 The readme is written a bit like a blog post and contains code for how hot-code swapping is done in Erlang, how it's done using the prototype, implementation details and a couple of ideas for possible extensions and refinements.
 I hope you find it interesting and I'd be curious to hear your thoughts!

 ​
 Some headings have their \"bullets\" showing wrongly
 org-hide-emphasis-markers does not change the situation. Even when using describe-char, it says the asterisks are being shown as just the background.
 ​
 describe-char of the two incorrect asterisks in each heading.
 Some things point towards emphasis markers, Only the headings which have a multiple of 3 asterisks suffer from this problem, the middle asterisk is higher than the other two (although no boldness is indicated by describe-char), the left one and the last one in the affected lines are a little closer to the middle one and not centered.
 I have no idea on how to pursuit this problem... any tips?

 If I would implement this naively, I would just keep a buffer with original text in latin alphabet, while only showing to user transliterated form.
 But I am asking because there is a chance something which does the job has already been implemented?

 I've been working on the ekg package, the Emacs Knowledge Graph. Simply put, it's a note-taking system, but also a system that can store lots of kinds of interlinked data, not just notes. Here's a few things at a glance to know about it:
  
Stores all data (including the note) in a sqlite database
 Uses a "triple" schema, which is a way to store a variety information as a graph favoring extensibility, ease of introspection, and two-way links between data, but not maximizing efficiency
 Uses tags instead of in-buffer links and backlinks, where tags can be multi-word
 Notes have no title, so in general small notes are easier in this system
 Designed to be easy to integrate with; so if you want to auto-generate notes when, say, you finish an org task, that's trivial to write

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I already tried to explain why the Haskell/JS story currently IMHO sucks: https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/115csmc/my_main_beef_with_haskelljs/
 But it turns out that it won't suck for much longer, and the reason is that "foreign export" is coming. I wasn't aware of this. Please accept my humble apologies. https://engineering.iog.io/2023-01-24-javascript-browser-tutorial/
 Here is why Haskell/JS won't suck anymore after "foreign export" is here:
  
I will be able to code a standard HTML/CSS website that mostly works even on text-based browsers and Tor Browser without JS enabled. Users of text-based browsers will get graceful "<foo.jpg>" placeholders. To code this website, I will obviously use Haskell on the backend.
 If the user has JS enabled, I can have a link on the site that says "activate interactive JavaScript features (5 MB download)". It is IMHO incredibly disrespectful to activate this mode by default, shoving something down the user's throat he didn't ask for. (Maybe the user is running a slow computer, or e.g. Qubes with lack of nice GPU integration and prefers the simple site because it has all the needed info.)
 Once clicked, a nice download indicator now spins for half a second.
 Boom!!
 The JS parts are now live. Static JPG images (previously rendered on the server) have turned into interactive HTML canvases with websockets support. A text counter that previously required a website refresh is now updating live through websockets. And so on.
  
This is the way. This is the future. This is the only way to stop the web from becoming an increasingly ugly place. (If you don't get it - if you e.g. really believe the new Reddit is better than old.reddit - you're lost and beyond saving IMHO, sorry.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok so I have a bit of a mystery. On one of my computer's Emacs installs, if I type an ampersand it gets underlined and shows what I assume are completions in the modeline. Annoyingly, it completes them without confirmation. So if I type &ke it gets replaced with け. This is really annoying when typing &key in Common Lisp since it gets replaced with けy. And oddly, it only happens on one of my computers, despite me sharing my .emacs folder between my computers using a git repo.
 I have no idea what this is or how to turn it off. I can't find anything about it online, and I'm at a loss as to how to find it within emacs (helpful-key says the ampersand is a self-insert-command, and pressing C-h while the ampersand is underlined exits out of whatever this is).
 What do?

 Just to set appropriate expectations, this series is not about Scala--it's about binary search--so I've tried to make the code as readable as possible even to people who don't know Scala, which means that there's a lot of imperative loops. (But higher order functions do show up starting in Part 6.)

 I'm not a native English speaker so I'm a little bit confused about it, even though I know it is a trivial thing. It's just a placeholder that gets replaced anyway with typed text. I was wondering if "title" is more appropriate, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm planning to set up an Emacs configuration for somebody writing books and stories who is not familiar with technology that much.
 There are nice looking distraction-free setups with https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode or https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti or https://github.com/joaotavora/darkroom or https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs
 However, as far as I've read (I haven't set up them except nano), they do not offer a very reduced and visually appealing recentf-open-file alternative.
 I'm thinking of a screen that pops up when booting Emacs that only shows the files I was working on recently in large font (maybe as buttons to click on). The file extension should be hidden, so that I may use it with Orgdown files that have long, descriptive file names (most probably within the same directory).
 Something like:
  
The Picture of Dorian Gray (that points to "The Picture of Dorian Gray.org")
 1984
 Notes about The Picture of Dorian Gray
 ....
  
Does that ring a bell for anybody here? Is there some similar functionality out there?
 Bonus for support for an easy to use file creation process like "add a new book", "add new notes", "add new short story" in combination with, e.g., a template mechanism. 
 Thanks

 It doesn't have any non-closed or wrongly nested tags, but the escaping isn't handled correctly.
 E.g. it has:
 <manufacturer>Procter&Gamble</manufacturer> 
 ... where the & symbol is not escaped correctly (thus "expected a semi-colon after the reference for entity" error).
 I don't control the companies generating those XMLs so I cannot influence the data quality or format at the source.
 Some of the files have![CDATA[ and proper escaping and some don't.
 I currently use xs4s.XML.loadString to parse it to scala.xml.Elem.
 I also tried to use ruippeixotog/scala-scraper to handle it as XHTML but some of the tags are <link> which are considered as empty tags by JSoup so it lost the data in them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have been using org mode for notes but I never used or understood the todo list features.
 Now I am trying to use org for todo lists, but having trouble fitting to my mental model. Maybe it can be configured, or you can tell me why my approach is wrong.
 What I tried is (foolowing tutorials) to make some tags HOME,WORK,then make some project topics in an outline like
 * TODAY ** TODO ask reddit // tag this with @HOME * TOMORROW ** TODO finish that thing * WEEK * SOMETIME * IMPORTANT ... 
 ​
 In this view, the tags are "where", and the list provides "what".I can easily move items from IMPORTANT to TODAY using C-c C-w.I can filter by home or work. Good so far.
 Now, I would like to see an adjenda view that shows at least the TODAY view, and hopefully a view of selected other categories. However, this requires assigning dates. I don't want to do that because dates do not mean much. In fact I rarely need to think about dates. I look at the calendar and note that something is due on "Wednesday", not caring about the date.
 a) my TODAY list is a "goal" not a contract. Some days I will make a list, then learn of an unexpected task will change everything, with no time to get back to the org mode undil end of day. And most days I find that I do not complete everything on TODAY's list. I want those uncompleted things to automatically carry over to tomorrow's version of "TODAY".
 b) I will use a calendar for things that have a particular associated time.
 c) I do not want to waste time deleting dates and adding new dates that mean little,or constantly moving tasks from one date to the next. Just leave them under TODAYuntil either they are done, or I move them to another category like SOMEDAY.
 In short, I think I do not want the calendar features for now, just a todo-list sorted by categories and with a configurable view and hot ckeys.
 Is this possible? Or, what _should_ I be doing?
 Thank you for your advice (and note that I really am a beginner).

Currently, I would have to create a new note in my org roam directory, and then copy the Apple notes text into it and save it. As for the images, I would have to store them in some directory and make a reference to it in my org file. Is there already a way to automate the whole procedure?
 It doesn't have to be about moving notes from Apple notes to Org files. I believe the process would be similar for moving notes from words to Org as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am new to Scala. I worked with Java, JS, and Python before. I am learning Scala for my new job.
 I went into some basic Scala material and now I am trying to solve Leetcode problems that I solved before using Python to get more used to Scala. The question I have is about the Two Sum problem. I am submitting the following solution and getting a compile error.
 ​
 object Solution { def twoSum(nums: Array[Int], target: Int): Array[Int] = { var res = Array[Int](2) var idxs = Array[Int](2) for ((num, index) <- nums.zipWithIndex) { var remainder = target - num if (remainder == num) { for (j <- 0 to (nums.length - 1)) { if (nums(j) == remainder) { // idxs += j idxs :+ j } if (idxs.length == 2) { return idxs } } } else if (nums.contains(remainder)) { // res += i res :+ index // res += nums.indexOf(remainder) res :+ nums.indexOf(remainder) } if (res.length == 2) { return res } } } } 
 The error
 Line 8: error: type mismatch; (in solution.scala) found : Unit required: Array[Int] for ((num, index) <- nums.zipWithIndex) { ^ 
 I don't understand why i am getting it. I understand that the return is not an Array as expected. However, both res and idxs are arrays. Any help will be appreciated, thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see compiler (and flymake) errors of this sort all the time. Consider the common pattern:
  
A.el - main code, requires and uses a.el.
 a.el - a “module” or component of a.el. Its only entry anywhere is via being required and used in A.el. Makes use of some of A.el's functions and variables.
  
How to handle this dependency to try to satisfy the compiler:
  
Non-solution: obviously you cannot (require 'a) in A.el and (require 'A) in a.el.
 Just forget about it and put a.el inside A.el. Leads to large and harder to maintain files.
 defvar nil and declare-function everything that the compiler complains about in a.el. I see this a lot. Ugly, hard to maintain.
 Just ignore the compiler warnings. Lots of people do this, alarms users, encourages ignoring linters.
 Factor out the bits of A.el you need in a.el into some A-common.el and require it in both places. Maintenance headache.
  
What I want is to tell the compiler: this feature will only be required in A.el, which is its parent. I do not require it, it requires me. Compile me after compiling my parent, and consider its symbols as fully available to me.
 Anybody have a better strategy?

 I'm realizing more and more that I prefer the flexibility of modal editing. That being said, I'm really enjoying the robustness of emacs in many other ways. I know evil mode exists, but I also don't want to just turn emacs into Vim, and it seems like evil swings too far in that direction.
 What would be a good way to make emacs a more modal editor

 So I just made some modifications to one of my favorite packages, evil-easymotion, and wanted to share:
 https://github.com/Overdr0ne/holymotion
 What is it?
 Basically, it’s just Evil-easymotion, purged of evil.
 My take: think of a movement command, like forward-word. Rather than repeating that command four times to go four words forward, you can turn that into a holymotion/easymotion, and press a single, home-row character, and jump straight there. For those familiar with Avy, it’s much the same(and uses avy under the hood), but generalized to work with any movement command, and the ability to restrict the scope of an avy motion to look only within some lisp object, like a buffer, a sentence, or a line. This will tend to give you short, usually one/two-character targets. In my…]]></summary>

 Org-mode is a highly versatile and powerful tool for organizing notes, tasks, and documents. While it was originally developed for use with the Emacs text editor on Unix-based operating systems, it can be used on other platforms as well, including Microsoft Windows.
 However, using Org-mode on Windows can be more challenging than using it on other operating systems for several reasons:
 Emacs installation: Emacs, the text editor used to run Org-mode, is not included in Windows by default, so users need to install it separately. This can be a complex process, especially for users who are not familiar with command-line interfaces or Unix-based software.

 I am modifying to to show an abbreviated code for the project directory for projects which have them and a code for those that don't.
 How can I add a tooltip to display the full path of the project when the mouse is hovered over the abbreviation?

At first it happened on my urxvt terminal, and then I tried on st terminal, the problem is still there. Some times the characters are a few ones scattered on the screen, some times they align in a line, and you can't select and delete them. They only disappear when you close and reopen the buffer. I also didn't find there is an operation pattern that triggers this. Anyone knows why, and how to solve this problem? thank you very much.

 * REPEAT Weekly Review - [ ] checklist here * Captured - Captured stuff * Personal :@personal: ** House stuff *** NEXT Task 1 *** TODO Task 2 ** PROJECT Title of Project *** WAITING Task 1 *** TODO Task 2 * Work :@work: ** Category 1 *** Task 1 *** Task 2 
 I read that splitting up Org files is not always a smart idea. I was thinking if I should put all them in one file and eventually create "custom agenda views" to separate the personal and work tasks in case things start to get crowded.

 That would enable one to have a canvas in a buffer that you could draw or hand write in. Excalidraw seems to be svg based, so you can put links, search text, etc. 
 I could live with a way that showed a preview of svg in emacs, but clicking on it would open it in a browser for editing, as long as the svg is locally stored. 
 Any ideas?

 To scratch a personal itch, I created a little package that integrates perspective-el into the built-in tab-bar.
 Emacs showing perspectives as tabs in the tab-bar
 Adding and removing perspectives using the 'x' and '+' buttons just works.
 It's not on any repo yet, as I'd like some feedback first ;)
 You can find it here: perspective-tabs
 Let me know what you think!
 addition:
 Credit where credit is due: 
 When building this, I had a long hard look at Bufler by alphapapa, especially the implementation in bufler-workspace-tabs.el
 I'm only hacking, while sitting on the shoulders of giants. Thanks! \m/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current opinions (subject to change):
  
Most websites should mostly work without JS enabled. (In fact, they should mostly work even on text-only browsers.)
 Most "single page apps" (SPAs) could easily be ordinary websites that mostly work without JS enabled.
 Most SPAs therefore suck (because of the fact that they are SPAs to begin with).
 Calling Haskell functions it not possible from the standard JS/DOM on an ad-hoc basis, is it? (Only in this way is it possible to enrich a website that mostly works without JS enabled, with certain features in cases where JS is enabled.) Note: Rumors of one or two individuals doing it with some obscure trickery does not count. It should be supported by the ecosystem as a fully fledged feature.
 Therefore, you are confined to SPAs when using Haskell/JS.
 Therefore, Haskell is simply not a suitable language for web development in general and that's just the way it is. (Apps that are legitimately SPAs only are a rare minority and that's not what I'm talking about here.)
 This is precisely where PureScript shines.
  
Someone please debunk the above, because I really would love to be wrong so I could use Haskell for everything.

 In short the following code

inspirated by this thread I thought that perhaps we might be able to collect case studies successes and failures (=learning experiences!) of AI-supported knowledge work.
My hypothesis is that it is to early to move above the layer of phenomenology. The best method to access such an unknown field is trial and error.
So, I am collecting individual use cases (or perhaps even: instances). Whenever I try something I document it and leave it there. Occasionally, I will write add hypothesis to it. I will add an example to show what I mean.
If my notes on this matter reach a level that is worth publishing I will bring everything together to a document that will be available as donationware.
If you have any case study, successful interaction or failure or thoughts in general, I'd be happy if you share it.
Live long and prosper

 Then months or years later, How could refile all the done tasks under heading of Plans to GetThingsDone heading in one single command? 
 Current solution is first to use occur to popup all the done tasks "C-u M-s .*DONE.*" in a narrow to subtree window, then copy them to heading of GetThingsDone; 
 Second to delete them under Plans heading with regex in the previous narrow window.

 If I check with M-x org-lint I get : Incorrect contents for PROPERTIES drawer.
 My header :

 Also not working :

 I checked magit-status on a different repository, and everything works as it should - it showed unstaged changes just fine.
 I turned on toggle-debug-on-error, but calling magit-status doesn't return any errors. I checked my git config and didn't see anything (I found this issue but the solution doesn't help me: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/54041/unstaged-changes-not-appearing-in-magit-plus-other-oddities)
 Did I toggle a setting somewhere to hide the list of unstaged files? Anyone have any insight?

 Right now my custom agenda view is as roughly as follows. It shows a block labeled "Tasks" but that shows all the TODOs in tasks.org not just the ones in the short list:
  ((" " "Agenda" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 'week) (org-deadline-warning-days 365))) (todo "TODO" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "To Refile") (org-agenda-files '("inbox.org")))) (todo "TODO" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Tasks") (org-agenda-files '("tasks.org")))) nil)))

 I settled on a layout that I love:
 - Capslock as Ctrl
 - Enter (when held) as Meta.
 It's symmetrical, and feels identical whether using my macbook pro's keyboard or mechanical split keyboard with array of thumb keys which would otherwise be great modifiers. Enter still works as usual newline if you tap it.
 When navigating with something like C-f, I appreciate my left hand doesn't have to move to go from C-f to M-f.
 I use Karabiner to make this possible.

Unfortunately, I'm a beginner with elisp, having spotty experience with CL only. How can I really get up to speed with elisp? What path of study would you suggest? What I've seen with elisp is that it's very close -- always seems to be getting closer -- to CL -- buuuut it has its own "best practices" realm, i.e., you can't just take your CL code and CL mentality verbatim into elisp. I've also heard that the traditional An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp hasn't really been updated to include the lexical scoping yet -- which is a game-changer that can't be avoided, i.e., you're learning/doing it wrong if you don't work with lexical scoping. Any ideas how to chart a course of study to become a competent elisper?

 I'm a product guy with non-prod-levels of previous coding experience (HTML/CSS, Python) and I'm learning Scala with the intent of making it the first language I'm proficient in to the degree that I can write software in it.
 Looking at the big picture - obviously Scala is multi-paradigm and sets me up for tackling a lot of different use cases by itself, but what language(s) do you consider to be the best ones for matching with Scala once I've mastered it?
 (I appreciate that the simplest answer to this is probably "Depends what you want to work on!" I'm still mulling my options in that sense, so getting a sense that 'Scala + x = Great prospects in y" would be incredibly helpful).
 Thanks!

 Function that accepts four arguments: - the path, as a string, - the description as a string, or nil, - the export back-end, - the export communication channel, as a plist.
 When nil, export for that type of link is delegated to the back-end.
 Can someone explain to me what is meant by the export communication channel here and possibly what it would be for the html back-end? TIA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I teach classes from 16 to 20 hs. This is shown, in the agenda view, as:
  Friday 12 June 2022 8:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:47 ┄┄┄┄┄ ← now ─────────────────────────────────────────────── 12:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 16:00-20:00 Teaching 16:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 18:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 20:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 
 This can be rather confusing at a glance, as it might lead to think that I could arrange a meeting at 18:00. Moreover, it doesn't help visualizing easily how much time an activity (such as Teaching, in this case) demands. 
 How would I go from that (above) to this (below):
 Friday 12 June 2022 8:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:47 ┄┄┄┄┄ ← now ─────────────────────────────────────────────── 12:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 16:00 Teaching 18:00 Teaching 20:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 
 so I can see how much of my time is blocked by activities?
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nothing but anecdotal data, but when a newcomer is faced with a choice between Emacs or Vscode, they will very likely choose Vscode, one of the reasons being that Emacs has a rightful reputation of having a steep learning curve. The idea of having to install a dozen packages to get modern IDE-like features and write Elisp right away in order to customize them can be daunting and overwhelming. Personally, it took me a couple of years before I even bothered to start learning Elisp to become a more advanced user.
 By providing a more streamlined and user-friendly way to customize Emacs, we can help make the platform more approachable and welcoming to new users.
 One approach could be to provide a series of customizable templates or configurations that new users could choose from when first setting up Emacs. These templates could be designed for different use cases (e.g., programming, writing, project management, etc.), and could include pre-installed packages, keybindings, and other customizations that are tailored to the user's needs. This would allow new users to get started with a powerful and customized Emacs setup without having to dive too deeply into the details of Elisp code.
 Another approach could be to provide a more user-friendly interface for customizing Emacs, such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or a set of interactive prompts that guide users through the customization process. This would make it easier for users to discover and experiment with different customization options, and would help them feel more confident and in control of their Emacs setup.
 I think we need to put some work and effort on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I started a podcast focused on Emacs and plan to release one episode a week. I've never done anything like this before, so I'm sure there's a lot of room for improvement :-). I've made a Git repository that contains the show notes, for those who aren't interested in listening to the podcast or me.
 In the fist episode, I discuss how I make use of locate, to recursively find files based on the current projects scope. You can read the episodes show notes here. Let me know if you have any questions, thanks!

 I tried `global-linum-mode` instead of global-display-line-numbers-mode.
 (setq linum-format 'dynamic) (global-linum-mode t) 
 It works and displays the line number aligning correctly, but the Emacs suddenly become very very very slow.
 How could align the line number with global-display-line-numbers-mode on? (Emacs-28.2 on Kubuntu-22.10

I use web-mode & the typescript-language-server for my day-to-day work, so I already have an LSP server bound to `*.ts` files. What I need is some what of specifying (probably in a directory e.g. with project.el) that the project `*.ts` files I'm working on are in fact deno files and need to initialize lsp-mode with the deno language server.
 Does anyone have guidance for configuring lsp-mode to work in this situation? I effectively want the default to be my current configuration, using typescript-language-server. When I'm in a deno project, I want to use the deno language server.
 Here you can see my web-mode configuration specified for `*.ts` files:
 (use-package web-mode :ensure t :mode (("\\.ts\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.js\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.mjs\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.tsx\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.jsx\\'" . web-mode))) (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t :hook ((web-mode . lsp)))

 Dear all,
 I just want to send you all a quick note to let you know that we have an opening for a student internship, on-site at NASA Ames Research Center, this summer:
 https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000000y6o5EAA/onsite-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime
 The student, if selected, will be working on extending our capabilities to test cFS/ROS/FPrime applications, especially those using Ogma and/or Copilot for monitoring. Both Ogma and Copilot are open-source software written in Haskell.
 Applicants for this internship must be U.S. Citizens and meet a minimum 3.0 GPA requirement. Prior experience is not required. Knowledge of the following will be considered a plus: Haskell or other functional languages, C/C++, Bash, git, Docker, Linux, NASA Core Flight System, Robot Operating System, FPrime. Please note that the academic level listed in the opening is merely indicative and students at other levels (e.g., PhD) will also be considered.
 For further details, or if you have any questions, see intern.nasa.gov and the specific listing at https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000000y6o5EAA/onsite-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime.

It works great and is certainly a great assistance to learning , but is there a way to silence the “declared but unused” warning and yellow underlining? 
 Maybe I’m misunderstanding how it’s supposed to work but I like to develop functions in a module ( I start with a skeleton Lib.hs from a stack project and add new functions to this file and then load and test them in ghci repl in a terminal. I get warnings from hls that say the functions are not used . So what ? There are plenty of cases where you want to define a function but not use it , so I’m guessing I’m doing something else wrong .

 import scala.annotation._ class GreaterThan(level: Double) extends StaticAnnotation class SmallerThan(level: Double) extends StaticAnnotations case class Quantity(@GreaterThan(0) x: Double, u/SmallerThan(1) y: Double, n: String) 
 I would like to access each field of the case class, its type, its annotation(with value) in order to do something with this information.
 Like I would like to know that there is x in Quantity, that is Double, that is annotated with GreaterThan, where the value of the annotation is 0. 
 Is there a way to achieve that in Scala? I know reflect could achieve part of what I want, mainly the fields and the types. But the annotations .. Can't find a reference for that!
 Many thanks

I want to use emacs to write all of my php code using php-mode and all the utilities it brings but the indentation is not what I want. When I type ENTER after a function I want to write the left curly brace with the same indentation as the function definition. Something like this:

 I guess php-mode is doing this but I'd like to change it. I've tried overriding the c-set-style to "linux" and many other styles but it doesn't work. Does anyone know how to do this without rejecting php-mode and use web-mode instead? I really like php-mode.

I'm trying to navigate to the next/previous cell, and I understand from https://tkf.github.io/emacs-ipython-notebook/ that this is done with `widget-forward` / `widget-backward`. However this doesn't seem to do anything. I don't know if this is because I'm also using evil too?

I've found this snippet: Using M-up and M-down to transpose paragraphs : however it moves the whole org-element (for example a paragraph), and I want something simply line-based. I've tried to define this hook: (add-to-list 'org-metaup-hook (lambda () (interactive) (prog2 (transpose-lines 1) (previous-line 2)))) (add-to-list 'org-metadown-hook ⠀ (lambda () (interactive) (progn (next-line 1) (transpose-lines -1) (previous-line 1)))) But is doing strange things and I don't understand transpose-lines very well. It seems like there is no way for the cursor move along with the line you are moving up and down. Is there a simpler way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a newb programming question, and unfortunately Googling has failed me. I see this kind of code all the time in minad's packages where an anonymous function is put inside a named function:  (defun tempel--completion-table (templates) "Return a completion table for a list of TEMPLATES. The completion table specifies the category `tempel'." (lambda (str pred action) (if (eq action 'metadata) '(metadata (category . tempel)) (complete-with-action action templates str pred))))  What would be the purpose of doing that? My guess is that the named function is later going to by applyed or apply-partiallyed, and the other function that will do the applying wants to influence the result in some variable way with an argument to the named function, and the lambda inside the named function only accepts a fixed number of arguments (because that’s how the underlying lisp code that is being hacked was written), and so there needs to be this middleman named function. 
 Am I close, or hopelessly far off? Are there any other reasons one might put a lambda inside a named function?

 I'd like to make it so that the ∎ appears on the line below and is right aligned though. Any help on that would be great.

standard for package management in the OCaml ecosystem. opam’s main package
repository contains over 4000 individual
packages, on average spanning 7 versions each.
Like many other language-specific package managers (e.g. cargo, cabal, etc.), opam
performs four main tasks:
Download the sources.
Resolve the needed dependencies of a package.
Provide those dependencies such that the build system can find them.
Run the build system.
It is pretty good at this. However, there are some problems with step (4):
The build is not properly isolated: it can (in theory) fetch arbitrary things

 I have two issues:
  
I end up with emphasis across manually broken lines, ie.This_lineText betweenThis_lineWill result in the line "Text between" getting emphasized. I thought by adding \n to the list of forbidden characters that this would be fixed, but it is not.
 I cannot mix emphasis properly ie.*T*his *should* be *bold* should bold "T", "should", and "bold" but instead bolds "This should"

Prolog is unique in that it's like a database where you enter "facts" into a running REPL, then do queries on those facts in the running REPL. This means a Babel, in order to be useful, must be able in one code block to add new facts to the REPL, then give answers to a code block acting as a query. Just the normal prolog-mode will only allow you to write out a database of facts in a buffer, then pose the queries in the the running REPL -- not both together. (This is not dissimilar to any other interpreted language with code and REPL separated.) Again, Babel should offer both in the same buffer.

 Tried to achieve similar behavior with the builtin whitespace-mode module but to no avail. Need to mark leading and trailing whitespace characters only, however Emacs puts space mark replacement everywhere:
 Emacs screenshot
 For a comparison, the same file opened in gVim, with whitespace mark only at beginnings and ends of lines:

 Is there a way to tweak whitespace-mode to not put replacement · mark outside of leadining/trailing parts? Is there an alternative 3rd party mode which can do this?

 It used to be working but now I do not know what I have done that it does not display the 5 agenda entries neither the 2 registers.
 I only have the following message:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because I've been concerned that emacs packages could contain exploits I've been manually auditing them all before manually installing them... This takes a long, long time to do for the hundreds of package I have installed, so I rarely update them all.
 I'd like to speed this up and ease my pain by using a package manager, but need to find one that will let me audit package before installing them. In particular, I'd like to go through diffs of package updates in ediff, and have the option of accepting our rejecting each update instead of just blindly installing it.
 Related to this, I'd also like to have the package manager store checksums (modern ones like sha256, not just git's sha1) for every version of a package I install, so that if I need to reinstall I can be assured I don't have to re-audit the code because it's exactly the same that I audited and approved earlier.
 Are there any package managers that would fit my needs?

 I'm trying to figure out how to specify, for a particular document, how to get latexmk to build using xelatex instead of pdflatex, particularly for org-beamer.
 Right now I've got:  %%% Local Variables: %%% coding: utf-8 %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-engine: xetex %%% TeX-command-extra-options: "-xetex" %%% End: 
 But this doesn't seem to do anything, looking at the org-beamer output, it's still saying ``Run number 1 of rule 'pdflatex'. 
 From what I can see, the +latexmk option imports the auctex-latexmk package, which adds latexmk to tex-commands-list and sets it as the default. So what I'm trying to figure out is how to get the -xelatex option to latexmk from emacs.
 I've tried futzing about with .latexmkrc but it seems to ignore it

 The goal of this project is to make it as easy as possible for someone with a light coding background (e.g. some experience with Python) to pick up the core ideas of Haskell quickly, without them giving up because of the unfamiliar syntax, complex types, seemingly restrictive purity, ill-documented ecosystem, and the many choices of set up. 
 In this respect, The Haskell Guide is not a tutorial, project-based guide or textbook, which aims to give a more complete walk through the language, in a linear fashion, but more like a reference guide that is carefully designed to be accessible and clear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was introduced to the world of linux and opensource softwares the previous year. At first I tried emacs because its features caught my eye. I found it hard to use at first so I decided to try something else and I found website and as of now I have some experience with vim. I use .org for taking notes. After some months I decided, I'll once again try emacs and then I found 'evil keybindings'.
 Right now I have few questions..
  
Which keybindings should I use?
 Will I need to use default emacs keybindings even if I use evil?
 Will I need to remap a lot of keys when using default emacs keybindings?
 Is one efficient over the another or is it just personal preference?
  
Hope I made my question understandable
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every-so-often I end up logging into a container for local triage. 
 Emacs is not installed by default on these images, but can be apt-gotten. However, default image size pushes the limits of the local storage. 
 I could install jed or jove or mg, but those are great VI replacements, not lightweight emacsen. These are all that google finds for me, given a range of search terms about lightweight emacs.
  
Q: Does there exist a true emacs (not work-alike) distribution that is made lighter through the separation of formerly default package into add-on libraries? For example, for my usecase, terminal-only core with python and comint and shell modes would be all I need, so I'd like to apt-get install emacs-core emacs-shell emacs-python and avoid all org-mode, mail, gnus, ... and also the graphical UI code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to upgrade the stack lts on one of my project (from lts-10.9 to lts-20.11).
 The project uses Persistent and Servant and I encounter the following issue.
 The following code
 ``haskell -- |Appis the monad stack used in the Servant Handlers. It wraps -- Servant'sHandlermonad in aReaderTmonad that holds the server's --Config` data. type App = ReaderT Config Handler
 type AppSQL = SqlPersistT App
 -- | Run & return a database query. runDB :: AppSQL a -> App a runDB query = asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query ``` doesn't compile anymore (with the following error message)
 ``` /home/max/devel/mae-website/server/src/Server.hs:49:22: error: • No instance for (unliftio-core-0.2.1.0:Control.Monad.IO.Unlift.MonadUnliftIO Handler) arising from a use of ‘runSqlPool’ • In the second argument of ‘(>>=)’, namely ‘runSqlPool query’ In the expression: asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query In an equation for ‘runDB’: runDB query = asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query | 49 | asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query |
 ^
 ```
 I understand that the "new" version of Persistent requires Servant Handler to be MonadUnliftIO which is not the case. I also understand that I am suppose to use acquireSqlConn somehowe (following this this), but I can't figure it out. Any ideas ?

I can move towards a deferred or lazy load of packages if needed, but I want to ensure if my assumption is correct or if there is something else evil occurring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 So one year ago I started learning Scala. Because it's a challenge and also because I want to get to know functional programming without hopping immediately into something like Haskell. Keep in mind that my current job and all my skills are within full-stack typescript development. So Scala is definitely something else and that's also why I am so intrigued by the language. 
 But now my question is, I kinda want to move away from typescript and go the Scala way. Because I think Scala has much bigger problems to solve and the language is more mature (also because of pay).
 I am hoping to do this one year from now. I am currently learning Cats and have been reading a lot after my working hours. I recently purchased "The definitive guide" for Spark, in order to maybe spark an interest in data engineering (see what I did there).
 A lot of co-workers look weird at me when I say I have been learning scala. And they ask me why. And they think it's a waste of time (because "java is bad")
 I have been looking at jobs, and I don't see a lot of remote junior scala positions (I will be working from Belgium). As I don't have any JVM experience, I do have a passion for learning. Does this seem possible to all of you or is this a stupid idea? 
 Nevertheless, learning this language has never been a stupid idea since it has taught me so much.
 But just wanna get an opinion from some of the pros.

 I have two years of Scala experience in the industry, and I have some career gap now and studying Scala and so on.
 Is the portfolio still important and something must have for future interview? or should I just concentrate in coding interview? What do yo think?
 I'm not sure where should I concentrate on first.
 For the portfolio, if I have to make, I'm thinking of some web app written in some nice looking code with cats effect like that.
 Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

"Given an unsorted integer array nums return the smallest missing positive integer. You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space."
  
Is it possible to create an O(n) run time algorithm in Haskell for this problem? 
 I can create an algorithm in C to solve this problem, but the only algorithm that I came up with modifies the input array which is something that I don't think I would do if I was programming for someone else.

 I've installed emacs both using brew install --cask emacs and brew install emacs-plus --with-native-comp but neither has solved the issue. Basically whenever I try to open a file or make a new file, I get this error which stops me from doing anything. I have default settings on all my config files. How could I fix this?

 Should I stick withe GHC 8.10 (and use lts-18.28) or should I upgrade to GHC 9.*.
 My problem with GHC 9 is that ,GHC 9.0 might have some bugs in it, but the going to GHC 9.4 might means less library are available to stackage. 
 I don't really need any of the fancy new stuff, I'm just upgrading to keep up to date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am more and more in situation when I have to use compact and laptop keyboards witch chiclet keys. I have no issue with flat chiclet keyboards, except of the typical layout of the last row. 
 Two examples, the upper one is a laptop keyboard, the bottom one is a compact desktop keyboard.
 https://preview.redd.it/hgsa2xfz0yha1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=824cc12df8fc5dce11ffeac1d4239f160d101eec
 Other features, common in Europe, are a short <shift> on the left side and a narrow two row <enter>.
 I need to figure out how to use them with emacs efficiently and possibly ergonomically. I am used to use a standard keyboard and my palm to press <Ctrl> but this clearly doesn't work here. 
 How do you type on keyboards like this? Did you change your typing habits? How do you use <Ctrl> and <Alt> on the right side next to the arrow block? What fingers do you use to press them? Do you change the keyboard or command map?
 Any hint and experience is welcomed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 A couple of weeks ago I posted about how I think that Erlang/OTP's behaviours are more fundamental than lightweight processes and message passing when it comes to building reliable distributed systems.
 The post got a couple of comments, including one from Robert Virding (one of the Erlang creators), basically saying that one needs lightweight processes and message passing to in order to implement behaviours, even though I sketched an implementation that doesn't use lightweight processes at the end of the post.
 Anyway, this inspired me to start working on a follow up post where I flesh things out in more detail. This post quite isn't ready yet, but I've finished a first Haskell prototype implementation which I'd like to share:

 As usual I'd be curious to hear your thoughts!

 I need to submit a summary of a series of events to a lawyer, and I wrote it up in an eleven page org document as it was most natural. Now I am trying to export it into a PDF file, because he is not going to know what to do with an org file or even a text file for that matter. The problem is, I need it to remain a nested outline, and not have nodes converted to headings. 
 It seems that a good approach is to export it to an HTML file first, and then convert the HTML file to PDF later. To do this, I thought about using AWK, but it would take too long to learn and perform. I was also looking at using some python with beautiful soup, which might work, although uncertain. Then, there is always the masochistic approach of editing the file by hand. I know sed might do the trick, but my sed pants are not big enough to tackle that one. 
 Help me, please...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[# This is a cross-post from Haskell Discourse; sorry for duplication.
 It is our great pleasure to announce the first OSS release of guardian, a dependency boundary constraint checker for Haskell monorepo!
 https://github.com/deepflowinc/guardian
 If you have a trouble with Haskell monorepo with increasing complexity of the package dependencies, then guardian could help the situation! It is developed at DeepFlow, Inc. and has been used almost for two years.
 With guardian, you can divide the packages into several "domains", and define the allowed dependency between those domains. Guadian will make sure that the only predefined dependencies between domains are introduced by package dependencies and report the result.
 For more details and motivation, please refer to README.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use amazonka-cost-explorer with a stack project. The latest supported ghc version by amazonka is 8.10.7 (here). I added amazonka-cost-explorer to my package.yaml file. Added 
 - amazonka-cost-explorer-1.6.1@sha256:e81d42dbdef267dc6d2cce70548f0c5170c875f235ca26cba5c00fcf88ebcc43,3331 
 to my extra-deps in stack.yaml. Used stack --resolver lts-18.28 build to build the project. I'm getting the following error with clang. 
 z80000gn/T/ghc29668_0/ghc_1.s:3394:2: error: cryptonite > error: instruction requires: sha3 cryptonite > eor3.16b v0, v1, v0, v2 cryptonite > ^ cryptonite > | cryptonite > 3394 | eor3.16b v0, v1, v0, v2 cryptonite > | ^ cryptonite > cryptonite > <no location info>: error: cryptonite > Error running clang! you need clang installed to use the LLVM backend cryptonite > (or GHC tried to execute clang incorrectly) cryptonite > `clang' failed in phase `Clang (Assembler)'. (Exit code: 1) Progress 1/12 -- While building package cryptonite-0.29 
 So far I have used the lts-20 as resolver for my project and it worked fine. Since amaonka supports only ghc 8.10.7 I used lts-18.28 as resolver. 
 I'm using Mac m1 Monterey (12.6.2). I installed llvm@12 via brew and when I type clang --version I get the following output. 
 Homebrew clang version 12.0.1 Target: arm64-apple-darwin21.6.0 Thread model: posix InstalledDir: /opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@12/bin 
 Any suggestions on how to fix this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built an interpreter in Haskell for a made-up language, but what I actually want to build is a compiler for it, which means that everything must be mapped to machine code and do the whole 3-address-code and assign address rooms for variables and so on. What I'm not sure about is how I want to go about that.
 This isn't a question related only to Haskell, but I'm more interested to hear what you guys have to say about that and which approach is best to follow and whether you could recommend some resources for me to read and go through, thanks!

 I have been working on this for several months now, but in this version I cleaned up a bunch of the types and made the library much less painful to use. It's still very new and has very few users, so there's probably some bugs in it.
 The usage instructions are in the readme

 It didn't however solve my issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a problem with my org-habit consistency graph. Mainly, I do not understand how it works.
 I have a habit which repeats every day and I mark it "DONE" on that day if I have compeleted it. If I do not, I don't change it's state.
 I have done it for 6 times during the past 2 weeks and this is my agenda org file contents for that habit:
 * TODO EXAMPLE SCHEDULED: <2023-02-12 Sun +1d> :PROPERTIES: :CATEGORY: EXAMPLE :STYLE: habit :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-02-12 Sun 20:17] :END: - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-12 Sun 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-11 Sat 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-10 Fri 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-05 Sun 20:15] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-04 Sat 20:15] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-03 Fri 20:15] 
 But when I open my org-agenda weekly view I see this:
 Here for example, all the days that were "DONE" are marked as "DONE" but they have different colors. I would like to see blue bar on the days that it was done and red bar for the days it was not.
 Also, could I assign different colors for different keywords?
 I would like "DONE" to be blue, "NOT DONE" to be red, "DELAYED" to be yellow and such.
 Right now, every keyword that is logged is marked as "DONE" in the consistency graph here and has different coloring even though all the states are "DONE".
 I am using Doom Emacs and org-super-agenda
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read NixOS documentation and Nix package manager specific docs about the way to configure packages (specifically Emacs since there are sections reserved for it) and everywhere it assumes we are using a global configuration .nix file or home-manager which I'm not using since I'm on openSUSE.
 My configuration goes in ~/.emacs.d and it only picks up my early-init.el (it wasn't being picked up in ~/.config/emacs for some reason) and nothing from my init.el which includes downloading packages through package.el and I'm sensing Nix wants to manag them.
 So I'm wondering how should I configure Emacs or if Nix expects a config .nix file (and where) or if it's a bit of both ways? How do you configure Emacs if you are not in NixOS and you installed it via Nix?

I want to stick with Rmd because it's nice and easy to make it so it knits to LaTeX looking exactly how I like it, needing no further editing. However, if someone has a solution that involves a different kind of notebook format that would work just as well, I'm open to it. Is Emacs what I've been looking for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to all!
 I don't know about you, but sometimes with embark I need to insert something into the minibuffer, not the main buffer. That is, I do for example M-x cp/consult-ripgrep-with-directory (personal command that calls consult-ripgrep but asks where to search before with a folder path), and there I need a directory. So I do M-x in the minibuffer (see enable-recursive-minibuffers) and type consult-recent-file, remove the filename to get the folder name... and then I want to insert what I have in the previous minibuffer. My problem is that embark-insert only allows inserting into the main current buffer... 
 Same problem when I know that I need the path of a bookmark.
 How do you do this guys ? Have you an idea to resolve this issue ?

 It brings to mind Emacs ludicruous speed which is another way of prepping emacs configurations for fast startup.
 Would the combination of native compilation, emacs ludicruous speed and some of the features of Emacs 29 make an Emacs version of Babashka a practical thing?

 I've reinstalled my emacs with

 And this thing started to appeared above my completion ui. I use corfu, but I don't think this is caused by it. More interestingly, after I set (tool-bar-mode -1), this ui no longer appears.
 But I want tool-bar, is there any method to turn it off without setting (tool-bar-mode -1)? I've google it but I cannot find anything related.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I want to give emacs another shot. Last time I tried it, I attempted to make my own config, and I installed some packages and whatnot, along with evil mode.
 It felt really sluggish and slow, it even paused while I typed due to the LSP plugin. I didn't really like it. Plus, evil mode made the entire experience very inconsistent. I love vim keybindings, but emacs is not just a text editor, and that's kind of the appeal of it, and emacs is built around its own keybindings, so trying to force vim ones on it just makes a mess really...
 So how usable is emacs as a text editor with the default ones? Having to reach for control all the time sounds annoying, although I guess I could replace caps lock for control, since that's far more reachable. How fast are you editing text with it? Do you prefer it over vim keybinds?
 People like the guy in the "tsoding" channel use emacs without evil mode, and he can type quite fast. Any tips about this?

 I'm trying to start a scala project. I tried to setup a basic environment project: I've installed metals as a vscode extensions, and I've installed scala and sbt from coursier like official scala docs. 
 Metals create lot of directories which I don't know what the are used for. Sbt also do that when creating a project with it. It was a bit overwhelming, so I just flush those and tried to start with the simplest dev environment I could get. 
 Well, I couldn't resolve a single custom package, so I just reset the regular way metals and sbt wanted it to be. Still can't resolve custom packages, unless the file is at the project root. 
 Is it "normal" to feel lost with the dev environment, or am I missing some point ? Is there some exhaustive-ish resources you would recommand to get started with scala ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally posted to the emacs stack exchange here, but figured id ask here as well!
 When I narrow to a subheading in emacs, I would love for it to be displayed as if it was the top level as opposed to it staying the level it actually is.
 For example consider this tree
 * Heading 1
 ** Heading 2
 *** Heading 3
 **** Heading 4
 ***** Heading 5
 foobar...
 In my emacs displays it more like this:
 * Heading 1
 _* Heading 2
 __* Heading 3
 ___* Heading 4
 ___* Heading 5 foobar...
 And if I narrow to heading 4 it displays like this:
 ___* Heading 4
 ____* Heading 5 foobar...
 However I would like it to display like as a 'top level' header like this:
 * Heading 4
 _* Heading 5 foobar...
 And when I wide, for it to display normally again.
 I'm very new to emacs, but I haven't found anyone else with this issue when searching, which suggests that either I'm doing something wrong or everyone is fine with it as is!
 If the latter is the case, I know overlays could potentially provide an solution but I'm very new to lisp (and especially elisp) so I have no idea whether it's even possible or not.
 I'm using the following version(s) of emacs on windows. I can attach my configs if needed!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Emacs flatpak runs well, but does not provide a command line emacs command, and ignores my .config/emacs files, insisting on creating a .emacs.d folder each time it runs. A command line version is essential for updating some packages, etc. The custom config for doom emacs is also essential to me.
 I installed Emacs using rpm-ostree and the command line version runs fine, loading the doom configuration as it should from .config/emacs and .config/doom. But the gui version does not run well with the doom configs - the window is initially black, and it only intermittently accepts keystrokes. If I disable my configs by running emacs -Q, the window opens and responds fine, there's just no doom goodness.
 I would appreciate any suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am trying to configure ERC to give me a desktop notification when any message is sent in particular channels.
 I looked through the code of both erc-desktop-notifications.el and erc-notify.el and neither of these packages support this feature.
 It seems that I could potentially edit the erc-notifications-PRIVMSG function from erc-desktop-notifications.el to add the desired feature, however I am not able to figure out how to detect the current channel name from this function.
 I was wondering if anybody knows of a way that this can be done.
 (edit: I cross-posted this to SO)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a begginer at Haskell, but lately at work I have to read and modify lots of haskell codes. The general context is you have lots of data (just imagine excel table), and the codes usually try to compute something from these data, but when data contains error, we want these computation to revert to a simpler form,
 Example: you have function that multiply a column A by 2 and put the result in a new column B, but when data contains error, I want this function to just put 0 in new column B. 
 What would be a good global strategy to modify the codes? , since there are tons of these functions, I don't want to modify them individually. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FYI. It looks like ruff (a pretty fast python linter) just work with flymake out of the box.
  (add-hook 'python-base-mode-hook 'flymake-mode) (setq python-flymake-command '("ruff" "--quiet" "--stdin-filename=stdin" "-") 
 If you are using Eglot, you have to add it to the diagnostic functions:
  (add-hook 'eglot-managed-mode-hook (lambda () (cond ((derived-mode-p 'python-base-mode) (add-hook 'flymake-diagnostic-functions 'python-flymake nil t)) ;; if not adding diagnostic functions to other modes just use an if ;; ... (t nil)))) 
 Also if you are in Emacs 29 shellchek just works on bash scripts. All that is needed is to enable it:
  (setq-default sh-shellcheck-arguments "-x") ; follow sourced libraries (add-hook 'sh-base-mode-hook 'flymake-mode) ; requires shellcheck 
 Hope this helps someone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Scheme you simply do a define for everything where you want to assign a name to a form. In CL you have many options (visit the zoo). So what is the best practice for elisp? For example I see setq, which seems generic, i.e., you can define a new symbol or update an existing one with setq (e.g., change a nil to t). So, e.g., how would I attach a name to a lambda anonymous function in elisp? Again, with Scheme it's simply put define in front of it. Once again, how much of CL do we, can we bring over to elisp?

 So I want to be able to somehow switch the 'git' user on the fly to switch between the 'git' user to push stuff to my personal GitHub repos vs my GitHub user for my work stuff.
 I have two separate GitHub accounts (one for work and one for personal stuff).
 How can I easily configure this in Emacs?
 Is this more of an Emacs config thing, or can I swap them out on the fly with the use of an interactive Hydra or something?
 Please link to any related guide if you can, since I can't seem to figure this out. Thanks!

 - Jump to definition works 95% of the times
 - Search symbol in workspace works 70% of the times and sometimes throws an overflow (?) error
 - I do not have the fancy intellij functions that find all subtypes for example or generally play with the type hierarchy
 - Many commands just fail saying that metals is not supporting the executeCommand command and I should check the capabilities of the session in which there actually is an executeCommandProvider with many commands reported available which do not work in reality
 ​
 Is metals just bad or have I possibly missconfigured it?

I had a DropBox fiasco this week. For some reason, all my zettelkaten files, on my office mac suddenly have a 3 Feb 2023 timestamp, both the modified and the created. The files on my shop laptop remain unchanged. But I'm worried and have temporarily turned off DropBox syncing. I've started a super-top-secret coding project that uses these file parameters and am worried my file's timestamps will get mucked with.
Oh well.
I spent a ton of time this week learning about manipulating python dictionaries. In the coming week, I'll be looking at html and css tools.
I'm really happy that my zettels are non-zettelkasting and life-focused.

 I'm considering which database library to use for a production system. For now I wanted to use persistent, however stumbled upon beam and it looks nicer to me. I've seen this post, however most of it is about persistent, and I didn't find how they differ in real production life. What I'm interested in is how do they compare in terms of 
  
features
 type safety
 scaling
 performance
 migrations
 productivity
 overall production readiness / adoption
  
I'm not afraid of a bit complexity, but I definitely hate TH / generated code. I'm keen on trying beam, but I'm just not sure if it's a right choice for a production system. Can someone more experienced with both libraries give their thoughts / opinions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last couple weeks while putting the treesit-auto package together it gained adoption much faster than I had expected. While I'm incredibly happy others found it useful, that also means that many assumptions in my hacky code were quickly blown apart. Also, in no small part due to my poor documentation, it was confusing to figure out exactly how/what would be supported when trying to add a new language.
 The key learning since I first tried to launch this package is that there's no reason for the grammar name in grammar.js to match the Emacs major mode, and there's a possibility that there are many "fallback" modes that should upgrade to the tree-sitter version, rather than just one. For these reasons and more, I needed to adjust the structure of how these modes are described internally alongside their grammars. As a consequence to that, some of the public functions/variables have been changed or removed. 
 I am sorry to anyone who has already picked up the package and started tweaking it. However, I think the changes will make the package more maintainable down the line, and it’s better to do this sooner rather than later. Most folks will probably not notice a difference if all you have set is treesit-auto-install and global-treesit-auto-mode. 
 Hopefully this is the last post I will need/want to to make about the package!
 TL;DR
 treesit-auto-fallback-alist no longer has any affect. If you want another language to be supported by treesit-auto, there is now a guide for contributing recipes

 and
 #+begin_src nix :noweb-ref A :noweb-ref B google-chrome-dev #+end_src

 #+begin_src nix :noweb-ref A google-chrome-dev #+end_src #+begin_src nix :noweb-ref B google-chrome-dev #+end_src 
 but this isn't very DRY and I'm fixating on this atm.
 Did a few websearches and even prompted GPT-3 but no dice. I think I need a human expert. 🙊
 # TL;DR
 For my home-manager Nix config, I am tangling a package name `google-chrome-dev` into the package listing `home.packages` (location A) and also to the `nixpkgs.config.allowUnfreePredicate` function body (location B) which just maintains a manifest of non-FLOSS packages that I want to clear for installation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 For many years, my Org workflow has depended on the Agenda's ability to display entries that have active timestamps in the :PROPERTIES: drawer. As of version 9.5.5 this is working fine for me, as it always has. 
 However, I remember a discussion on the Org developer list some months back that the developers planned to remove this feature at some point in the future. I cannot, however, locate the thread where I read that. A search of this Reddit forum does not mention this matter either. 
 So, I thought I'd ask specifically: Is it true that the Agenda is going to lose its ability to act upon active timestamps in the :PROPERTIES: drawer?
 If true, that would be very unfortunate for me. But I want to be prepared if it happens. I see nothing about this matter in the Release Notes for Org 9.6, so I surmise it's safe for me to upgrade -- for now. 
 Many thanks for reading, and to all the Org developers for Org mode, which is a work of genius.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a new intern in a data engineer team, without any prior functional programming knowledge. I am asked to learn scala to be able to understand and add code to an extract transform load program. 
 I started with the coursera class, however a team member told me that this class was going way too deep and that I wont be using anything learnt with it (the code is "easy" scala, without expert concepts). However, I have also been told that a team member was coding poorly because he kept coding like we would do with imperative programming (using loops and coding in a way where several lines could be simplified with one or two by programming the way scala is supposed to be used). 
 So I'm kind of stuck because I'm being told that the coursera class is going too deeply, but I still have to find a tutorial so that I dont end programming in scala like I would do with an imperative langage. What can I do ? What do you suggest ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've had this idea knocking around in my head for the last 5 years. It would be a great help for debugging, if the messages, warnings and errors printed to the *Messages* buffer could show where they came from!
 This is not the same as simply adding a timestamp, something much easier (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/32150/how-to-add-a-timestamp-to-each-entry-in-emacs-messages-buffer).
 Today I am getting the following error and I have no idea where it's coming from, and it's frustrating.
 Error processing message (file-missing "Cannot open load file" "No such file or directory" "company"). [2 times] 
 That's just one of a ton of different sorts of errors over the years that were unhelpful due to lack of indication where the fault is. I've learned to write all my error messages with more background info, but we can't expect every package author to do this.
 Any ideas on the necessary architecture? I guess the C source needs a patch, but can we do it in such a way that we don't need to update the calling convention i.e. so we don't need package authors to update every message sexp in their codebases?

 But I noticed when marked as done, it does not go to the next month's last day, which in this case is 2023-02-28. So I googled some answers and the only one that I found was this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/31683/schedule-org-task-for-last-day-of-every-month
 Using the mentioned function:
 * TODO Pay something DEADLINE: <%%(diary-last-day-of-month '(1 31 2023))> 
 Which works perfectly, but I want it to be repeated.
 Did you guys know some way to schedule/deadline that repeats on every last day of the month?

It works as expected initially, then I run into two problems:
  
At start up, sending a really large input will show Data.Binary.Get.runGet at position 32: not enough bytes.
 When sending multiple small inputs, I eventually get RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds. I see this happening in the hs.free() JS call, the hs.malloc() JS call, or the malloc Haskell call
  
Printing out the pointers shows that the input pointer uses the same memory address every time, and the result pointer isn't continually increasing, so it doesn't seem like a memory leak. Regardless, the pointers + length are well below the size of hs.memory.buffer.
  
How do I go about debugging this? I've never worked this low-level before, and I'm not really sure how to start
 I've attached the relevant files below; am I doing anything obviously wrong?

 Anyone know when this changed, and why?
 EDIT: to partially answer my own question. I see that starting with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Gnu Emacs was replaced with mg. Catalina was released in October 2019. I don't know anything about Mg but it seems like a neat project.
 If I were to guess the "why", I'd say it has to do with licensing?

macOS and how we can make this task easier.

Why would I want to run a NixOS virtual machine on macOS?
My colleague at Tweag, Dominic Steinitz, asked me this question after I shared
my first minor achievement in this area, and it struck me that I have never
described why exactly I run virtual machines (VMs) on my laptop and why I want
to make it easier for myself (and others).
Like many members of the Nix community – more than 25% according to the Nix
community survey – I rely on macOS to provide me a stable
shiny desktop environment. However NixOS is based on Linux and so many pieces
that are used for developing and testing it require running it in VMs. I’ll
describe some major use cases for it below.

 I've just installed the pdf-tools using Melpa, I get no errors there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/haskell. Almost ten years ago, I wrote a version of the boardgame Yinsh in Haskell. The project included a web-based frontend and a backend for the computer opponent. Everything was running just fine (on my website) until a few weeks ago when Heroku shut down its free tier, where I was hosting the backend.
 Since then, I made multiple unsuccessful attempts to resurrect the game somehow (for example: compiling either the frontend or the backend). The main problem is that I have been developing in other programming languages and ecosystems since then and I'm not familiar with the modern Haskell stack anymore. But it would be sad to rewrite the project in another language. Haskell was actually a really nice fit for this project.
 Back then, I was using Haste to compile Haskell to JavaScript for the frontend part. But now I fail to properly restore the environment to make the hastec call work. Also, I'm not sure if Haste is still actively maintained.
 The backend was 'plain' Haskell, but I have trouble setting up an environment where I can use ghc to compile the backend. I have an old .cabal file that I was apparently using to deploy the backend to Heroku, but it seems that too many things have changed since then.
 I could probably try harder to restore that old state somehow, but I think what the project really needs is some kind of ecosystem modernization. I would be very glad to hear your suggestions on how to move on. If someone is interested in the project itself, I would also love to take contributions on https://github.com/sharkdp/yinsh.
 Yinsh, by the way, is a really fun abstract board game (two player, zero sum, perfect information) which is similar to Gomoku/"Five-in-a-row". As far as I know, there is no other implementation of Yinsh out there that features an 'AI' opponent (my implementation uses a classical minimax-style search in the game tree).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 Related Setup:
  
Emacs running via WSL2 with Ubuntu on Windows 10
  
​
 Related Issue:
  
Copy text from Windows 10 and pasting into Emacs via 'C-y' Emacs keybinding totally works as intended to paste stuff into Emacs
 However, I cannot do the reverse: 
 Ex: I cannot copy and paste text from Emacs using selecting text in Emacs, hitting 'M-w' in Emacs to copy it to the clipboard buffer, and then just click 'Paste' wherever I want in Windows 10
 
  
​
 Related Research I Tried:
  
I tried referring to this guide page: 
 https://shelper.github.io/posts/setup-emacs-in-wsl2/
 
 However, the 'copy paste sharing between wsl2 and windows host' section just says you can use 'GWSL' above.
 However, I referred to that section, and found the related 'GWSL-Source' GitHub repo and its associated Windows store link: 
 https://github.com/Opticos/GWSL-Source
 https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/gwsl/9NL6KD1H33V3?hl=en-us&gl=us&cid=storebadge&ocid=badge&rtc=1
 
  
​
 Question:
  
Can anyone confirm how this works for the clipboard manager?
 From your related YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6GXBEQ5KzA), it looks like you can easily launch GUI programs from various Linux distros all from Windows 10 etc which is really really cool
 But, it doesn't really show how the clipboard functionality would work.
  
​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I experience the following anoying behavior: If the text in the minibuffer get's longer then the display width and lines are therefore continued on the next line, the minibuffer scrolling no longer works.
 What I mean by that is that it "logically" works as when I press <down> or <up> the indicator correctly displays the number of the item I am supposed to choose when pressing <RET> yet I can't visually see what I would select.
 First I thought it is a marginalia issue but that's not the case. With marginalia it only shows much more easily as marginalia adds text to minibuffer entries thus making lines longer. So this is a thing I can easily reproduce when making the whole Emacs window narrow enough to trigger continuation lines in the minibuffer.
 Seems to be an issue with the highlight line logic and scrolling? Report it as a bug?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been taking notes in org-roam and publishing them online for my own use. It's worked really well and has been immensely valuable. I did run into something today that was a puzzle--I knew I'd taken a note on a topic, couldn't find it easily and didn't have access to my home machine. My thought: I'd be fine if I could search everything for the word 'awk'.
 I'm thinking the following would be elegant:
  
Index the notes generated by org-publish using sqlite's FTS5 capability.
 Add a search field to the generated sitemap.
 Update the publishing script to copy the indexed database along with the notes.
 Write a CGI to handle the searches and link to search results.
  
Minus the CGI part it was stupidly easy to get indexing with stemming working:
 #!/bin/sh sqlite3 t.db<<EOF CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE notes USING FTS5(title, body, tokenize=porter); EOF for file in $(ls *html | grep -v sitemap) do data=$(cat $file | sed "s/'/''/g") sqlite3 t.db<<EOF INSERT INTO notes(title, body) VALUES('$file','$data'); EOF done 
 I did run into one ugly that I need an elegant idea to help solve--indexing the generated HTML leads to poor search results (e.g. searching for `awk' finds every note due to the export language boilerplate). I've had the following thoughts:
  
index the org files. Downside: this will pickup the #* lines which works poorly for some searches (e.g. session).
 use an HTML parser (e.g. Beautiful Soup) and carve content out of the generated files. Intuitively, this seems like it would be brittle.
 publish to text as well, index those and associate the results with its HTML counterpart.
 use some combinations of org-export filters to index the content.
  
As an aside, I realize there are services for this but there's no fun in that.

 Is this a result of bitrot? Or do I have weird interactions with another package?
 I've been adding debugging messages, and truly it seems that the directory variables don't get updated when you navigate across the directory tree...

 :var myvar=mydir/my.org:mytable 
 Problem with this approach is that i have lots of tables, and sometimes i need to pass 5-6 at a time, so i had to write 
 :var myvar1a=mydir/my.org:mytable1a :var myvar1b=mydir/my.org:mytable1b :var myvar2a=mydir/my.org:mytable2a :var myvar2b=mydir/my.org:mytable2b :var myvar3a=mydir/my.org:mytable3a :var myvar3b=mydir/my.org:mytable3b ... 
 etc, i would love to be able to just use
 mypythonfunction(tbls=['mytable1a', 'mytable2a']), etc 
 Or even
 mypythonfunction(tabletype='all table_a') 
 I considred merging all remoute tables in one, but it won't work cause they have different structure between types (table A, table B) and even with same type they can be a bit different. So it won't work.
 This suggestion looks promissing, but it's for local tables, is it possible to adjust it to make it work with remote files? So i can
 :var myvar=mydir/my.org 
 And then
 mypythonfun(myvar, tabletouse=''table1a") 
  
This is what i use now
 #+BEGIN_SRC python :var vara=data/my.org:table_a :var varb=data/my.org:table_b :var varc=data/my.org:table_c :hlines no :colnames no :results value table :return ttout import scripts.bimp_figures as bf ttout = bf.calcrtn (vara, varb, varc)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 
 I am trying to use data from a JSON to fill in an HTML template. I have decided to use hamlet from yesod, but I am opened to easier-to-use alternatives.
 I am struggling with defining correct types to make it through typechecks ... :D
 Given such JSON (shortened from what I am working with):
 test.json
  {"parameters": [ {"name": "name", "required": true}, {"name": "limit", "max": 10} ] } 
 If I parse the JSON with aeson like:
 ``` newtype Parameters = Parameters { parameters :: [Parameter] } deriving (Show, Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON)
 data Parameter = Parameter { name :: Text , required :: Bool , maxValue :: Maybe Integer } deriving (Show, Generic, ToJSON)
 instance FromJSON Parameter where parseJSON = withObject "parameter" $ \param -> do name <- param .: "name" required <- param .: "required" maxValue <- values .:? "max" return ( Parameter { .. } )
 newtype Parameters = Parameters { parameters :: [Parameter] } deriving (Show, Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON)
 template :: Parameters -> Html template parameters = [shamlet| $doctype 5 <html> <body> <h1> Page generated from the JSON data source <table>
  <tbody> $forall Parameter name required maxValue <- parameters <tr> <td> <p> <code>#{name}</code> $maybe realRequired <- required <span style="color: red">REQUIRED</span> $maybe maxInput <- maxValue <li><strong>max:</strong> #{maxInput} 
 |] ```
 I am getting an error (rightfully so I guess) that the types don't match -- the template expects all it's inputs with the type Text, but I have multiple -- some are simple types like Integer, others are Maybe Integer or even Value (they can be either string or integer).
 How can I satisfy the hamlet template constraints? Should I go about it differently?
 I can add full code if neccessary, it's not long, I just don't want to make this question longer than it already is :D
 Thank you for any help with this :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm writing some content for a game that has its own data file format. So I figured I'd whip up a derived mode for it to make things easier.
 The problem is that the game engine only uses tabs for indentation, and nothing I've tried has managed to get that working.
 Here's the behavior I want when in this major mode: hitting the tab key inserts a tab character at the beginning of the line. If that can't happen, I'll settle for hitting the tab key inserts a tab character at the cursor. I'm not concerned right now with behavior during region operations.
 I also want to define keywords and use font-lock to highlight those (and strings).
 How do you get that working in a derived mode? Or is it the sort of thing that would be easier to do by writing a mode from scratch?

 I have a big org file. When calling imenu, it will only contain a few dozen entries that I can jump to and no more. It doesn't contain any entry after some point in the file. What's more it doesn't parse the headlines correctly as shown on screenshots
 When I use imenu command, then press tab for completion, it will autofill a * , then will show me dozens of entries starting with a star:
  
Abc
  
** ABCD
 *** Thing
 ******Stuff
 When on a working version, pressing tab will only show me the first level of org headlines, the topmost level, to choose from.
 This happens with emacs 28.2 started with -Q This works perfectly fine with emacs 26.2 started with -Q
 I tried updating the org mode that comes with emacs to 9.6.1 but that doesn't change a thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just created a package related to notetaking, hoping that it would be useful to others as well. It can be found here, https://github.com/chatziiola/klp, still in its infancy. The problem is that, using the snippet I have in the readme file, I get an error that the package can not be loaded (even though it gets properly downloaded). If I load it manually, it works, but it is unacceptable.
 I must have done something wrong when writing the package, but since it is my very first one, I do not know where to look for more info. 
 Installation Snippet:
  (use-package klp :straight (:host github :repo "chatziiola/klp") :init (setq klp/static-notes-dir "~/path/to/dir")) 
 Error
  Error (use-package): Cannot load klp Disable showing Disable logging 
 Manual loading command
  (load "path/to/klp.el") 
 I do not need a solution. I tried following the information I found online, related to package creation but I know I have a long way to go. Suggestions on where to look or possible points of failure are more than welcome.
 EDIT: I used the (setq debug-on-error t) command in my init.el to have more data for you but the error remained the same.
 EDIT 2: Corrected the installation command

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if this is an issue for anyone else, but when I use lsp-java, emacs becomes very prone to crashing and I have to kill the whole process and restart emacs to recover. When it's not crashing emacs, the lsp loves to make very strange formatting decisions for me. For example, I'll get to the end of a line, then I put the semicolon and suddenly the line gets partially deleted. And if I undo that, it returns to normal, but put the semicolon back causes the deletion again. Not to mention the seemingly random indenting of lines that it likes to do. Does anyone else have this issue? Is lsp-java really this poorly made?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like what ghcup project and what they do, I think it is a fantastic tool for many people. But since I am using NixOS mostly, and I also use nix flakes for projects, I often use these buildInputs for devShells instead:
 nix devShells.default = with pkgs; mkShell { buildInputs = [ cabal-install haskell.compiler.ghc94 haskell.packages.ghc94.haskell-language-server hlint stylish-haskell # ... other packages ]; }; }); 
 If you wish to have a specific version pin down you could even do:
 nix haskell.compiler.ghc944 haskell.packages.ghc944.haskell-language-server 
 However, this often leads to building the entire haskell.packages.ghc94.haskell-language-server since the official cache doesn't have it. I am wondering, if there is enough people doing the same thing, if so it may be a good way to share resource and have different versions of ghc and their HLS-es built and cached as a untrusted substitutor?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title,
 I am using eglot + pyright for only 1 week, and i love it (great improvement over my pre lsp days :)), features that are most usuful to me are variable/function highlightning, xref-find-definitions, eglot-rename, etc. But i am unhappy with performance, sometimes it's relively fast, but often (usually after i edit variable or function name) it can get to lagging state when everything is very slow, highlightning does not work (forget about autocomplete), etc. I have only 7 files in project, so it should not happen i think?
 1, usually what's the reasons for lags? Is it eglot/client/device side or is it server/pyright/internetspeed side?
 2, is it good idea to try to turn off some features? which are most resource hungry/less useful? i was thinking to turn off error checking while i am in "creation mode" and turn it when i am ready to clean up. 
 3, did anyone try lsp bridge? how did you like it?
 Here is my init.el
 (use-package eglot :ensure t :defer t :bind (:map eglot-mode-map ("M-f" . xref-find-definitions) ("M-F" . xref-go-back) ("M-r" . eglot-rename) ("M-t" . xref-find-references) ("M-j" . flymake-goto-next-error) ("M-J" . flymake-goto-prev-error)) :config (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(python-mode . ("pyright-langserver" "--stdio"))) :custom (eglot-autoshutdown t) (eglot-events-buffer-size 50000) (eglot-send-changes-idle-time 3) (flymake-no-changes-timeout 5) (eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p nil) (setq eglot-ignored-server-capabilities '( :documentHighlightProvider)) :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) ) 
 I tried looking at eglot events buffer, but didn't find any clues on lags.
 Update: here is the list of capabilities that can be disabled

 ​
 I'm trying to setup my Django environment using pylsp, corfu and although i manage to setup everything ok, i now get two minibuffers with completion-at-point popups. I've been trying to figure out how to find which packages are being used by the functions but describing-functions or -variables don't seem to point me anywhere other than the source file and the description. What am i missing? 
 Example: https://imgur.com/a/Qmady71
 Just want to get rid of the one in the background but it would be nice to learn how to trace this functions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 I've been using Emacs for about a year now, and it's single-handedly the best program I have ever used. It has ultimate extensibility, and it's just the perfect tool for so many tasks.
 Among those tasks however, I want to add note-taking, could someone please help me find a method that fits this criteria?
 I want to write notes in markdown, be able to see and use these notes on mobile through a sync client like Nextcloud, have bi-directional link support, and maybe some tags.
 ​
 I first tried using org-roam with the md-roam, but I don't really like the node system that it creates, or the IDs for each file, I feel like it's almost locking me into a sort of org-roam ecosystem, I prefer something more like a tree approach, with folders and subfolders for different categories.
 I think what I'm trying to replicate is basically the functionality that a program like Notion gives, but in Emacs.
 ​
 What suggestions would you guys have? Any and all would be greatly appreciated :)

 I'm happy to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.1!
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!!
 This is probably the largest release to the Yampa project in a decade: The unit tests for all of Yampa's public API are now complete. Many of the new tests are implemented using QuickCheck, and care has been taken, whenever possible, to express the properties based on the continuous-time (FRP) interpretation of Yampa's primitives and combinators.
 Hopefully, this battery of tests will help speed up the process of accepting new features and changes, and will free resources that can be dedicated to investigating other issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understandably not everyone wants auto-formatting to be all-or-nothing, previously only formatting the entire buffer was supported, so if someone wanted to auto-format a single block or function it wasn't possible.
 Now two new commands have been added:
  
elisp-autofmt-region auto-format the selection.
 
elisp-autofmt-region-dwim auto-format the selection, using the surrounding/adjacent S-expression when there is no selection.
 
 This makes it useful as an editing feature for emacs-lisp, so you can paste code and format it, wrapping by the fill-column, removing unnecessary space & indenting.
 It's available on melpa as elisp-autofmt, see: elisp-autofmt for details.
  
Example for reference:
 Unformatted text:
 (defun hl-indent-scope--next-sexp-by-syntax (end level) (let ((found nil) (pos-init (point))) (cond (hl-indent-scope-show-block-fn (while (and (hl-indent-scope--search-forward-open-sexp end) (not (when (funcall hl-indent-scope-show-block-fn level) (setq found t) t))))) (t (setq found (hl-indent-scope--search-forward-open-sexp end)))) (unless found (goto-char pos-init)) found))

 Here's an example:
  (setq-local header-line-format `(:eval (funcall #'message "hi"))) 
 When I try running the same line but with eval instead of :eval, it appears that the header is not set properly (it becomes an empty line rather than “hi”).
 But as far as I can tell, :eval is not its own separate function: when I try to call describe-function on it, I get "no match" unless I remove the colon (":").
 So my question is, what is the purpose of the colon here? Why is it necessary, and where else should/could it be used?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 As my previous post stated, I am in the process of learning Haskell (mainly from learnyouahaskell.com at the moment).
 I've played around with folds a little in the past when learning Scala, and the learnyouahaskell site is currently introducing them.
 One example it gives is an implementation of the elem function (omitting type declaration):
  elem' y ys = foldl (\acc x -> if x == y then True else acc) False ys 
 I have implemented it as a pattern matching function (whether from a previous example on the site or just to try it I can't remember):
  elem' _ [] = False elem' e (x:xs) | e == x = True | otherwise = e `elem'` xs 
 I can understand the foldl version no problem, but my question is regarding performance on large lists. Is the foldl version a worse performer if there exists a matching element early in a long list?
 Would it run forever on an infinite list?
 The pattern matching version obviously terminates as soon as it hits a matching element. But the foldl version appears to just "note" that there exists an element, but continue checking the rest of the list anyway.
 I understand this is just an example to understand how folds work, and behind the scenes is probably not how the elem function is implemented. I just want to make sure my understanding is correct regarding this fold example. That is, that there is no way to terminate the fold process early.
 Thanks!

 Open-source SimpleX Chat – developed in Haskell! - now supports multiple chat profiles – and your traffic will be isolated from other chat profiles in the app.
 Also in v4.5/4.5.1:
  
unsent message draft.
 filenames based on UTC time, to prevent leaking timezone.
 reduced battery usage.
 fixed WebRTC calls for users with blocked UDP.
 fixed some important bugs and one medium severity vulnerability (it had no impact on message or connections security though) - we will publish the disclosure in 2 weeks, together with our bug bounty programme announcement.
 Italian interface, thanks to the users' community and Weblate – with 5 more languages in progress (Chinese, Dutch, Japanese, Czech and Hindi)!
  
See more details in this post and download the apps via the links here.
 We need your help!
 We are looking for a Haskell developer who is more competent in network stack and memory management than we are to help us improve the stability of the platform. Please get in touch if you are interested in a short-term contract.
 Some common SimpleX Chat questions:
 Why user IDs are bad for privacy?
 How SimpleX delivers messages without user profile IDs?
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc.?

For example, I don't want to see the task I have clocked in or the song that is playing right now on every's buffer mode line.
 What is your approach to that?
 Currently, I have (setq mode-line-misc-info nil) to avoid the global-mode-string in the mode line and this helps already a lot. 
 Now, where to put the global-mode-string information instead? I've found the minibuffer-line-mode package and this displays my global-mode-string in the minibuffer area, which is great in 95% of the time. However, sometimes there is important information displayed in the minibuffer that is too fast overridden by minibuffer-line-mode. The cases are rare enough, that I don't have an example right now. But when it happens, it's super annoying.
 So using the minibuffer is maybe not the best option here. So I'm wondering if it's possible to display global-mode-string right-aligned in the menu bar? At least I have it activated and the text in my global-mode-string would fit here (length).
 Is that somehow possible? Couldn't find anything into this direction...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really like Emacs. It's powerful and has so many packages it feels like it can do just about anything.
 My use case is that it's mainly my text editor for anything that it isn't worth opening my IDE for. The problem is, this means I'm not using it every day and therefore I'm not really getting past that early pain while you learn shortcuts/commands. It's almost like I'm starting from scratch every time I use it. Every simple action requires looking through a cheat sheet or doing a web search.
 I know that Emacs isn't supposed to be used in a mainly mouse driven way and many will say that half the point is all the powerful shortcuts that will, eventually, improve productivity. I'm just never getting past the early pain and I'd like something with more menus and more mouse driven support, but still all the features and extensibility of Emacs.
 I'm not looking to switch from my IDE for the heavier stuff, although that would probably help me get over the learning pain, but I've already done that with the IDE and don't want to give that up.
 I did see mousemacs and I really hoped it would be the solution I was looking for, but it seems a little buggy and actually makes things more complicated to use - not less.
 Can anyone suggest either an Emacs alike that fits my needs or a simple way to setup Emacs in this way?
 Edit: Specifically, what I want to be able to do is much of the every day stuff via menus. Either context menus or menu bar menus. I want to be able to list buffers and switch/remove to them. I want to be able to access the customisation via a menu - especially themes and packages. Also - ideally package specific commands as well as being able to assign various commands to a custom menu.

 For example, given the tree:

 Reparenting it on node 3 would produce the following tree:

 This looks like a job for a Zipper. However, I also think this can be done with a Lens, although I'm just getting started with Lenses, and not entirely sure. I'll probably end up implementing both approaches for kicks. but I'd like to hear from Haskell veterans that, given this problem, which of the two would be your choice, and why.

 (use-package helpful :ensure t :commands (helpful-function helpful-variable) :config (when (featurep 'evil) (evil-define-key 'normal helpful-mode-map "q" 'quit-window))) 
 and I accidentally added a quote to helpful-mode-map, ie
 (evil-define-key 'normal 'helpful-mode-map "q" 'quit-window) 
 This cause the q key to close all normal mode windows.
 As I understand lisp the quote caused the helpful-mode-map to be sent to evil-define-key unevaluated, so why would it result in its application to all the windows?
 Is it because of the way evil-define-key is defined, or is it some general feature of Emacs Lisp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi !
 I'm a 2 year old typescript web developer. I'm a bit tired of web development and typescript, and I'm willing to learn something different. I could use your expertise about scala, more precisely to know if it is suited for my needs : 
 1/ I'm willing to learn a functional programming language. I tried recently purescript (haskell like), it made me afraid of purely functional programming, so I though "why not start with something less rigid ?". 
 2/ I would like to make native application (specifically CLI tools), and it has a scala-native compiler. 
 3/ I also would like to make GUI apps. Is it doable with scala ? Does using JavaFX and ScalaFX prevent compiling with scala-native, and make my app require the JVM to run ? 
 Also, would you consider setting up a reliable development environment for scala simple or complicated ? For example, I consider typescript development environment a bit too patchworky to set up. 
 Thank you for any clue you can give me and thank you for reading ;)

 It's been some time that I have been trying to figure how to work out configuring an exchange outlook account for notmuch with Oauth2 / multifactor verification, since basic authentication is now deprecated by microsoft.
 In my UNI there is a 2FA/Oauth2 authentication for Outlook. I am definitely by no means expert on this, however, I have tried all sorts of different setups (using a setup for offlineimap with oauth2 authentication, a mutt token generation script, among others).
 Unfortunately, my university does not give permission for other registering additional clients (and apps in general) therefore I can not use azure for registering new applications therefore I can not use thunderbird's client_id and secret for generating a token. Long story short, I can not use my favourite editor for composing/sending email for outlook.
  
I have IMAP enabled, but is not possible to register application
  
Is there any way to configure outlook with 2FA/oauth2 :
  
without having to bypass my university's regulations
 any other solution at least for
  
 Composing email within emacs and somehow telling outlook application to send it ? (osascript?)
 Fetching new email and exporting to maildir therefore I can create a notmuch-friendly database?

 This release introduces kele-list, bound to s-k <resource type> l. In previous versions of Kele, you could only fetch single resources; there was no way to view groups of resources at a time. Now, with kele-list, you can create ad-hoc “overviews” of specific resource types within a given context and namespace; hitting Enter on any entry in this list brings up the resource’s full manifest.
 Here's a screenshot

 Let's say you have a list of lists of Doubles [[Double]].
 [[-0.5,-0.5,4.5,4.5],[1.5,-1.0,6.5,9.0],[1.0,2.0,5.0,6.0]] 
 How would you go about iterating (map) over each one, and making a new list with the elements at index 0. Then doing a new list with elements at index 1, then at index 2 and finally at index 3.So essentially the first list will have all the elements at index 0, second list at index 1, etc.
 Result would be:
 [[-0.5,1.5,1.0],[-0.5,-1.0,2.0],[4.5,6.5,5.0],[4.5,9.0,6.0]] 
 Or it could also just be function that takes [[Double]] as first parameter and the index as second parameter and then returns a single list.
 createList :: [[Double]] -> Int -> [Double] createList list index = map function list index function :: [Double] -> Int -> Double function list index = list !! index 
 Something like that.
 Then I could do something like:
 let list = [[-0.5,-0.5,4.5,4.5],[1.5,-1.0,6.5,9.0],[1.0,2.0,5.0,6.0]] let listAtIndexZero = createList list 0 let listAtIndexOne = createList list 1 let listAtIndexTwo = createList list 2 let listAtIndexThree = createList list 3 
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got Emacs 28.2 (self-compiled, 739b5d0e52) on one host of mine.
 Whenever I do invoke M-w (for kill-ring-save) of a region that has - I guess - non 7 bit US ASCII characters included, I get "Non-ASCII string must be encoded in advance" followed by the region text with re-coded characters in the minibuffer. As a matter of fact, the message appears even before that when the region gets expanded to the first non-ASCII character and the later kill-ring-save is failing when kill-new is invoked within its definition.
 Good case: I mark a region like "foo bar" and am able to push it into the clipboard by invoking M-w as usual. Perfect. No issue with marking the region or pushing to the clipboard.
 Error case: However, when I try to create a region with "foo€" or "fooä" or "fooß" or "foo¼" I get the weird behavior described above as soon as the first non-ASCII character gets added to the region and the clipboard doesn't get any new content pushed to when I do try to kill.
 I'm not sure if this is related: when the region gets defined by pressing C-SPC and then expanded by right-char I also get "Replaced 0 occurrences" with every new invocation. This is suspicious as well. Maybe they both are related? 
 With emacs -q, there is always normal behavior (good case) without the error message. So it has to be related to my configuration.
 The same configuration using Emacs 27.1 also does not have this weird behavior. 
 How can I debug this? Does this sound familiar to you? Do you have an idea what that might cause? 
 My config is rather hard to impossible to bi-sect with a sane effort. :-(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately, I have been thinking of playing with desktop GUI in Scala (I know that "desktop is dead", but I am not a fan of Electron and have always been fond of reading about native GUI, so I want to try it out). There are already tools like Skija and JWM which provide a good starting point, but I miss an important feature that a GUI framework should have: the ability to hot reload code, so changes can be seen on the screen quickly.
 I have come across three alternatives so far:
  
Going with a markup language: I could create my own XML-like language or use a template engine to parse the UI and generate components. This approach is used by Gtk, WPF, JavaFX, Avalonia, and others. While this solution is good for simple projects, it becomes annoying for more complex UIs that need to be dynamic. It also seems burdensome to connect all events and signals.
 
Embedding an interpreted language, like Graal-js and interoperating with Scala for non-UI code. The downside of this approach is that most of the code would likely be written in JavaScript, kind of defeating the purpose of having a Scala GUI.
 
Joining forces with other projects like HumbleUI, which already achieves this goal, and bridging them to Scala. The downside again is that HumbleUI is written in Clojure, not Scala. I like the idea of contributing to the success of other projects, but I am not sure if most people will want to deal with a Lisp.
 
 I am wondering how I can achieve this feature. Is a Scalajs-Graaljs-Scala combo worth the complexity? Should I go with a templating engine? Would it be possible to do some Scala hot reloading of the view with Ammonite, and if so, how? Are there any other ways I am missing? I have been asking myself these questions for some time now, but I cannot find the answers on my own.
 Maybe I am spoiled by web development, and hot reloading is not that necessary. What would you like to see in a modern GUI framework to make desktop apps that can compete with Electron ones?

Copy and kill. I can kill from the cursor's position with Ctrl+K. Is there a way to copy and kill the line from the current cursor position?
 Kill current word. In the line void foo(int a, |int b) { /*do stuff*/); the cursor is right before the second int declaration. Can I kill this word without having to use Ctrl-3-d?
 Select and modify all identical words on the same line, i.e. in the line void bar(double a, double b, double c, double d) I found out it would be better if each argument was an int. Can I for example select the first instance of double somehow, then as I retype it to int, all other instances are also changed? I think I've seen tsoding do this, so it's probably just a matter of installing a package. 
 Any input on how to efficiently selecting large blocks of code fast would also be appreciated!

 I also made a reddit thread about this same topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskellquestions/comments/vi0tcm/how_to_redirect_cabal_haddock_output_to_a/
 I would like to be able to redirect cabal haddock output to a folder of my choice. In issue comments it was suggested to add an --only-documentation flag to cabal install.
 I've been trying to implement this change and realised that I don't actually know what would be the most desirable behavior for this command.
 Should it only copy documentation that's already been generated? Or should it generate documentation? If it generates documentation, then should it be also able to re-run haddock and overwrite the existing documentation even if documentation already exists?
 If it's able to run haddock (and not just copy documentation) then should it put the documentation in the standard folder first and then make a copy? Or redirect the documentation where the user wants it and create just this one copy?
 Is adding this option to cabal install the most reasonable way to do this? Are there other, maybe better ways of achieving the same end? Wouldn't it be better to add some kind of additional flag / argument to cabal haddock?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have this issue with org publish and I can't solve it...
 I want to make a different postamble for different parts of my project (the same problem applies for the head variables).
 I define two different postamble as this:
 (setq pages-html-postamble "<footer>My postamble 1</footer>" blog-html-postamble "<footer>My postamble 2</footer>") 
 And then I reference them in different components of the org-publish-project-alist variable like this:
 (setq org-publish-project-alist `(("pages" :html-head ,pages-html-head :html-postamble ,pages-html-postamble ;; ... :recursive t) ("blog" :html-head ,blog-html-head :html-postamble ,blog-html-postamble ;; ... ("blog-images" :base-directory "blog/" :base-extension "jpg\\|gif\\|png" :publishing-directory "docs/blog" :publishing-function org-publish-attachment :recursive t) ("assets" :base-directory "assets/" :base-extension "css\\|ttf\\|ico\\|png" :publishing-directory "docs/assets/" :publishing-function org-publish-attachment :recursive t) ("all" :components ("blog" "pages" "blog-images" "assets")))) 
 ​
 Then if I publish from command line using emacs --batch --load publish.el --funcall org-publish-all I cannot get the result that I expect of two different postambles but only the pages postamble is used. Is there anything I am missing? I tried with org-html-postamble-format but I encounter the same issue.
 Org version is 9.6 and Emacs version is GNU Emacs 29.0.60 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, X toolkit, cairo version 1.17.6, Xaw scroll bars) of 2023-01-10.
 Any help is appreciated, thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm rather new to Emacs and have been trying to move all my coding setup to Emacs. I started setting up with Doom Emacs, but its buffer management wasn't exactly what I wanted. (Otherwise Doom Emacs has been a great starter for my use cases, though.)
 ​
 What I am hoping to get is the following
  
Each project has dedicated buffer list
 I can easily navigate between projects
 I can always see the current project + list of projects
 I can close and recover project at any time (or hide project)
 I can see the file tree of the current project (probably with Treemacs)
 (Bonus) I want to dedicate some "perspective" or "tab" for programs such as Org Agenda, Elfeed, etc.
  
​
 I am currently trying with perspective rather than persp-mode, as it segregates the buffer list as I like (#1 above). I've got projectile with persp-projectile, and that seems to give me what I need for project navigation (#2 probably, still not 100%). I get some help in my mode line for project focus (#3, partially).
 But I'm rethinking about my approach, as tab-bar-mode would give me nice visual help (#3), and it seems difficult to recover a perspective using perspective, and persp-mode may be a better fit in that sense (#4). The Treemacs integration isn't working for me either, and I get the same list of file trees for all perspectives -- I'm pretty sure I'm doing something stupid, but this was handled nicely with Doom Emacs's workspace support (#5). But perspective seems to work best for segregated buffer list (#1).
 ​
 I would probably have to tweak and customise more to get my setup exactly to my likings, but I'd appreciate if experts here can shed some light into how they manage multiple projects!

And we can also use the deferred.el library to write asynchrous code, but it's just trying to pass other actions to run another process asynchrous, while still on the same thread.

 I like it when I enter the org-agenda weekly view and see the hourly view of my day with my recurring tasks that have specific time period of doing.
 But since these tasks are recurring , I see them repeated for every day of the week. 
 Can I hide (like collapse) all these TODOs from future days and show only the ones for the current day?

On further inspection, this seems to be due to my decoder conduit not getting all of the bytes from the file. Is there a limit to the number of bytes that await will get?

 From what I can find, paradox has a limited capability to do this, but paradox was recently closed down/abandoned.
 It seems like users of quelpa or straight may have an easier time given that packages are pulled in natively from their respective source repositories, but installing a package from a repository like melpa may be harder since the package isn't tied into a repository commit or revision - you may have to see if the package ships with something like a NEWS file, scrape the package description for a source URL (which the aforementioned reddit comment does) and clone it to view raw commits, or something else.
 I would really like to have this capability but wanted to check to see if I may be missing something before trying my hand at some novice elisp to try and solve the problem in a very general way.

2.6d Create Zettels
In this step of the Zettelkasten process, we take our Literature Notes full of contextualized ideas and add them to our Slipbox as de-contextualized ideas. (see [[2.6.1 The Zettelkasten Process]])
Purpose
We create zettels to confirm our applied comprehension of an idea and to re-contextualize it against other ideas found in new sources. (see [[2.6d1 Creating Zettels Improves Applied Comprehension]])
Creating Zettels
Create Zettels  --  Decontextualize Ideas


Open Literature Notes taken from Capture Ideas (see [[2.6c Capture Notes]]) on second monitor.
Read through Literature Notes and Zettels.


What does this note mean for my own research & questions within my slipbox? Why did these notes capture my interest? 1
What ideas would help me continue a discussion in an existing Zettel?

Create a new Zettel to capture that idea. ([[2.3a Conditions for Strong Zettel]], [[2.3a1 Obsidian Zettel Template]])

Review Zettel


Does my title actually summarize EVERYTHING in this Zettel?  If not, it's 2+ ideas.  Split it up.  ([[2.3a2 Zettel Titles]])

Zettel Creation Tips
When developing a topic in your Zettelkasten, a new zettel should be in direct response to an existing Zettel 2 (see [[2.6e Develop Topics]]).  This ensures we're focusing into fewer topics (and thus making more progress), rather than scattering our focus across many topics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In "How to Take Smart Notes", Ahrens states that before you add a slip to your slipbox, you should:
"Make sure it can be found from the index; add an entry in the index if necessary or refer to it from a note that is connected to the index." (p. 104)
Originally, I thought it was just important that no slip gets orphaned and is connected to some thread of notes, but this statement gives me the impression that every slip must be no more than 1 degree of separation away from the Index. But once your slipbox grows a significant amount, this will cause your index to get cluttered, which runs counter to what he says later:
"[Keywords in the index] should be chosen carefully and sparsely. Luhmann would add the number of one or two (rarely more) notes next to a keyword in the index." (p. 106)
How do you interpret this for Zettelkasten? Is it crucial that there's no more than 1 degree of separation from your index? Or is it just important that it's eventually connected (e.g. with potentially 2, 5, 10, or more notes between the Index and the new slip)?]]></summary>

 I have a question for all the Meow users. Basically, how did you get used to its unique selection behavior?
 I am a former evil user, who recently switched to god-mode. In customizing my own god-mode setup, I am finding that I am basically trying to recreate several aspects of Meow. The one stumbling block I find is the auto-selection since it is so different from vim's visual-modes or Emacs' mark behavior. 
 Alternatively, has anyone been able to recreate the Beacon state without meow or modified meow to have a more traditional selection.
 Lastly, if you don't know what Meow is please check it out. Even if it is not for me, I think it is a super cool project that I want to succeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been modifying my modeline. I have an :eval-based construct to show whether the current buffer is modified using the colour of an "M":
 (:eval (let ((mod (buffer-modified-p))) (propertize "M" 'face (if mod 'my/modified 'my/unmodified) 'mouse-face 'mode-line-highlight 'keymap `(mode-line keymap ,my/modeline-modified-map) 'help-echo (format "Buffer is %smodified. \\{my/modeline-modified-map}" (if mod "" "un"))))) 
 The faces are red for modified and grey for unmodified. This works in that it displays a red "M" when the buffer is modified, and a grey one when it isn't. But if I switch to another window, away from a modified buffer, the M stays red. The text of simpler string constructs (e.g. "%b") in my modeline goes a lighter grey in the no-longer-active buffer. How can I make the M do this too? (Ideally, with a darker red, rather than straight grey-ing out.)

 I occasionally need to do some C++ development for Windows. Can I do this from Emacs within wsl or do I have to install Emacs on Windows? For instance, can I get lsp to connect to a windows lsp server? Anyone doing something similar?

 Ever since I started building Indigo (Scala.js game engine) I've wanted to be able to write WebGL/GLSL shaders in Scala.
 The output from GLSL is very satisfying to produce even for a total amateur like me (have a browse around http://www.shadertoy.com for inspiration!), but the tooling is pretty rough around the edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok so I just fixed a problem myself but I still don't really understand why it was a problem to begin with.
 So I'm on debian 11 using doom emacs and I want to use jedi as my python language server.
 I use pip to install it, which puts the binary in $HOME/.local/bin.
 I add a line to my .bashrc file and sure enough /home/*myName*/.local/bin/jedi-language-server shows up when I run which.
 But when I opened a .py file in emacs, I would get an error message about the language server not being installed, and a message in the *lsp-log* buffer saying that jedi-language-server was not found in path.
 I fixed it by adding this line to config.el:
 (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/home/*myName*/.local/bin")))
 So, I guess my question is, why did I need to add that line?
 Where does (doom) emacs get its default path variable from and why does it not just copy the users path?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am customizing AHK-mode to meet my needs. Because that mode derives from prog-mode, I understand it inherits prog-mode's syntax table. The problem is that there are often an odd number of unquoted quotation marks (") in a single line in my AutoHotkey code, which causes emacs to interpret large swaths of multi-line text as one single string.
 How I can I modify the syntax table for ahk-mode to force emacs to believe a string ends at a newline character? I made a couple changes to at least prevent the fontification of multi-line strings (I changed the variable ahk-double-quote-string-re to "\".*?\"", and I followed this advice when defining font-lock-defaults), but emacs still believes the multi-line strings are there, which messes with other things like imenu and hl-prog-extra.
 Any help would be much appreciated!

 Who has a nice trick for "promoting" a single value to a one element list, without repeating the variable name or the looping forms? Bonus points for creativity/compactness/clarity.
 Basically:
 (do-list (val value-or-list) ... ) 
 but working.
 Update. ensure-list (for emacs 28.1+) does just this. The manual even lists this as an explicit example:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on an exercise to build a simple parser for the Forth language). The grammar and data types I came up with are given below.
 Grammar
 Int = @{ ASCII_DIGIT+ } Add = { "+" } Sub = { "-" } Mul = { "*" } Div = { "/" } BinOp = { Add | Sub | Mul | Div } Dup = { ^"DUP" } Drop = { ^"DROP" } Swap = { ^"SWAP" } Over = { ^"OVER" } StackOp = { Dup | Drop | Swap | Over } Rhs = _{ Int ~ BinOp } BinExpr = _{ Int ~ Rhs } CompoundExpr = _{ BinExpr ~ Rhs } BuiltInCmd = { Int | BinOp | StackOp | CompoundExpr } COLON = _{ ":" } SEMICOLON = _{ ";" } WHITESPACE = _{ " " } HyphenatedWord = _{ ASCII_ALPHA+ ~ Sub ~ ASCII_ALPHA+ } Word = @{ HyphenatedWord | BinOp | ASCII_ALPHA+ } Cmd = { Word | BuiltInCmd } Defn = { Cmd+ } WordDefn = { COLON ~ Word ~ Defn ~ SEMICOLON } InvalidWord = { COLON ~ ANY* } LineItem = { WordDefn | Cmd | InvalidWord } Line = _{ SOI ~ LineItem+ ~ EOI } 
 Types
 newtype Line = Line [LineItem] data LineItem = WordDefn Word [Cmd] | Cmd | InvalidWord Text data Cmd = Word | BuiltInCmd data Word = Word1 Text | BinOp data BuiltInCmd = Int1 Int | BinOp1 BinOp | StackOp | CompoundExpr Int [Rhs] newtype Int = Int Int data Rhs = Rhs Int BinOp data StackOp = Dup | Drop | Swap | Over data BinOp = Add | Sub | Mul | Div 
 Now, BuiltInCmd is either an Int, or a BinOp, etc. The problem is, I get compilation errors like "Multiple declarations of ‘BinOp’", so, I'm forced to create a wrapper BinOp1. But surprisingly, Word is defined similarly and doesn't have a problem. What am I doing wrong?

 Bringing happiness and ease, no need to vex.
 They may differ in their approach and style,
 But the love they share, goes the extra mile.

 In a love story, like none other, in history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working with this TypeScript source code, which is large, and I'm really missing some features offered by a tool called Go Guru for the Go programming language. Go Guru has the following commands, that work after you correctly set its scope:
 callees show possible targets of selected function call callers show possible callers of selected function callstack show path from callgraph root to selected function definition show declaration of selected identifier describe describe selected syntax: definition, methods, etc freevars show free variables of selection implements show 'implements' relation for selected type or method peers show send/receive corresponding to selected channel op pointsto show variables the selected pointer may point to referrers show all refs to thing denoted by selected identifier what show basic information about the selected syntax node whicherrs show possible values of the selected error variable 
 So, in Go I use callers to figure what functions are calling the function at-point (where currently the cursor is in Emacs) and try to follow the flow of execution from there. I don't recall if go-guru Emacs package has support for callstack command, but that's what I do.
 for TypeScript, I don't know any tool that would allow me to do something like this. At most, I perform a project-wide search for the name of the function I'm interested, but this is too cumbersome if I want to investigate the flow of execution.

 Threads are often created in rooms where I'm subscribed. I'd like to be able to unsubscribe from threads that I've determined aren't relevant to me, so that I stop receiving tracking notifications about new messages sent to those threads. My best guess about how to do that, after browsing the not-fully-documented emacs-slack code, was to call the slack-message-unfollow command while visiting the thread buffer I wanted to unsubscribe from. However, it doesn't work; I keep getting notifications about new messages in that thread afterwards.
 Is it possible to stop getting notifications about particular threads? If so, how?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I'm wonder if I'm doing something wrong or misunderstand but I'm currently facing some issues on my NixOS system.I'd like to use something like direnv to load flakes. My setup below works great when just launching emacs, but when using emacsclient, it seems to not be working, even though I'm not really receiving any errors from the envrc buffer. It loads the .envrc, build the flake input and export. It just looks like the path does not work afterwards.
 So I've configured Emacs to run as a services using services.emacs.enable = true. For my shell I added programs.zsh.shellInit = ''emulate zsh -c "$(direnv hook zsh)", but I've also tried eval "$(direnv hook zsh)".
 Direnv is installed using the nix-direnv installation instructions under "Via configuration.nix in NixOS".I read some recommendations that envrc.el is a better alternative then direnv.el, and after some testing I have to agree.(envrc-global-mode) is enabled in my config. This works perfectly with a normal emacs instance.
 For some reason it just does not seem to work with the emacsclient.Starting emacs --daemon specifically with a emulated zsh shell does not seems to work.Executing envrc-reload and direnv-update-directory-environment also don't seem to solve it.
 I honestly don't know why this does not work. That's also why I'm posting here and not in a github repo, since I'm not sure where the issue is occurring from. Most of the time I just run normal emacs, but the bigger the config become, the more I'd like to switch to running the daemon.
 Any info is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I put together quickly a binding to the NNG library, it's simply a fork of the existing binding to Nanomsg updated to work with NNG using the "compatible API" plus some bug fixes. For basic usage seems to work pretty well:
 nng: https://github.com/jimenezrick/nng-haskell
 The original nanomsg-haskell bindings are from Ivar Nymoen and Ben Gamari, thanks to them!
 I think the Haskell ecosystem needs a big push in terms of improving its offering of supported RPC/messaging libraries, hence I wanted to have some basic bindings in a workable state.
 For context, if you are familiar with ZeroMQ, Nanomsg and NNG (its evolution) are equivalent RPC/messaging libraries with some technical differences, but in essence the same concept. These are in my opinion a bit a more lean technologies compared to the more bloated gRPC ecosystem.

 I don't like the default dired behaviour of directories' buffers persisting even after you leave them, so I've set it up to always reuse the same buffer.
 The problem that I have now is that it does it even when just visiting some files and that makes it long and difficult to go back to the place I was before doing that.
 For some context: I have configured my dired-map to move upward and inward using h and l (on the lines of distrotube's config, I'm an evil doom-emacs user).
 For the outward movement I'm using this:
 (kbd "h") '(lambda () (interactive) (find-alternate-file "..")
 Taken from http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/emacs_dired_tips.html 
 For the inward movement I'm using this:
 (kbd "l") 'dired-find-alternate-file
 Which works great when visiting a child directory,…]]></summary>

 For example, if I have somewhere in my multi-file and sprawling config the statement:
 (require 'elisp-settings) 
 then, the next call to (require 'elisp-settings) will catch that this file has already been provided, and skip re-loading that content.
 ​
 However, every time that I call:
 (literate-elisp-load "elisp-settings.org") 
 It will keep loading all that configuration code. Does anyone have a way to only load each literate config file exactly once?

Working with big files without line feeds can be slow. The standard specifies records and uses a character to indicate the end of such records. I thought if I could make Emacs interpret that character as a line feed, I could then better work with files.
 I tried using an Emacs display table to replace the ^] with \n but it did not seem to improve performance, even though it did visually change the display of text. So, I assume I need to work at a lower level. Does that seem correct?
 Do I need to create a new coding system to get Emacs to consider that end of record character as a line feed? I had also thought of some kind of hook that replaced ^] with \n upon every read and vice versa with writes. Any other suggestions? I would prefer it be a seamless process for other users because I may write a mode to handle such files. Thanks.

 I searched there from LinkedIn and certainly there are a lot of scala jobs. But when searching with keywords like 'scala visa' or 'scala relocation', only handful of jobs were searched.
 Maybe I approach is wrong, is there other place to search? 
 Or maybe most Scala jobs in those countries are Visa supported but not mentioned on JD, so I should try them also even though they didn't mention about visa or relocation support?
 Or is there other way I need to try?

I'll ask my question in the form of a scenario:
I'm learning the field of game theory, so I begin by reading some shortform articles to get started. My first concept is "Dominated Strategies". I don't have any slips in my ZK that touch this subject. I use Folgezettel because I like its structure, and my next available number at the "end" of my ZK is 35.0.
Should I:
Now a few things:

Almost a year ago, when I was on an early stages of learning emacs, I realized that the most clickable key (CTRL) is also the most annoying to use. I tried maybe the most popular approach - to remap ctrl to caps, but that pinky movement was making the whole left part of the keyboard almost unusable in a combination with ctrl, maybe because of the muscle memory, or maybe because of small hands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering if there is a package that can do the few things listed below for braces and parenthesis? I recently had to use Intellij and noticed it had some features by default which I would love to get working in Emacs.
 ​
 Make braces/parens in pairs.
 ​
 When a pair of braces/parens are made, with the cursor in between, hitting enter makes it so the bottom brace goes down two lines and my cursor is in the same position as if I'd hit enter once
 ​
 When on a bottom brace, show the name of the function of statement that is attaches to. An example for this would be if I had a brace for a function that is longer than my screen, when I put my cursor on the bottom brace, something would pop-up (or mini-buffer) saying something like def test() or for etc.
 ​
 Edit:
 So I found electric-pair-mode which solves the first two problems. Anyone know of a package that does the third?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am getting annoyed by automatic formatting rules which I don't know where they come from, every time I press RET on a line with a function declaration. Modes in the buffer:
 Minor modes enabled in this buffer: Auto-Save Company Eldoc Flymake Font-Lock Lsp-Completion Lsp-Diagnostics Lsp-Headerline-Breadcrumb Lsp-Managed Lsp Lsp-Modeline-Diagnostics Lsp-Modeline-Workspace-Status Whitespace Word-Wrap-Whitespace The major mode is C++//l mode defined in cc-mode.el: 
 Example:
 void test()<cursor, pressing RET> // gets formatted into void test() // 4 spaces added // removed 4 spaces added previously, // added one curly brace, and hit RET: void test() {<pressing RET> // gets formatted into void test() { // curly brace moved up one line // 2 spaces added 
 In my .emacs however, I have explictely set:
 (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook (lambda () (setq c-syntactic-indentation nil) (setq indent-tabs-mode t) (setq tab-width 4))) 
 Asking for help with C-h k <RET> gives me:
 RET (translated from <return>) runs the command newline (found in global-map), which is an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’. It is bound to RET. (newline &optional ARG INTERACTIVE) Insert a newline, and move to left margin of the new line. With prefix argument ARG, insert that many newlines. If ‘electric-indent-mode’ is enabled, this indents the final new line that it adds, and reindents the preceding line. To just insert a newline, use M-x electric-indent-just-newline. 
 However, toggling electric-indent-mode or just calling M-x electric-indent-just-newline makes zero difference in behavior.
 TLDR: I don't want emacs to try to be smart about formatting, I can't detect what particular mode / variable needs to be changed in order to just insert newline.

 This would basically be my first major foray into Haskell beyond the LYAHFGG book, and, thus, my first time trying to get as close to purely functional as possible in the embedded space. 
 My current startup strategy is pretty meh in my opinion, which was to just use the generated assembly from a *.hs and link it together with some other tooling, but that somewhat goes against the spirit of what I’d like to do, which is to approach “provable embedded software”. 
 If there are any good books or text based tutorials out there that you can recommend it would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple weeks ago I posted a little bit of code for getting Emacs 29 to automatically switch between major modes and their tree-sitter enhanced versions, and I couldn't be more thrilled with the response it got. Since then, I've spent some time refining the package, getting it on MELPA, and adding a couple features that I felt were missing. In particular, I wanted Emacs to install and use a grammar as soon as I visit a file that has a tree-sitter version available. treesit-auto 0.3 introduced the treesit-auto-install variable, which can be nil, t, or 'prompt. I like to set it to 'prompt, in case my internet connection isn't great. This is what it looks like when I visit a Rust file without the grammar. If treesit-auto-install is t, it will skip the prompt and install the grammar right away. 
 Otherwise, when this variable is nil (the default), it will try to fall back to one of the original major modes, such as python-mode, js-mode, or rust-mode. The exact details on how it finds a fallback are documented in the README on GitHub.
 Thank you to all who have contributed so far! It's been a fun project to work on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been going id crazy with links to my daily plan file (ala rainer's udumy course). It's been great, but there is one gnarly bug I need to squash that comes up randomly.
 TL;DR: I need a way to force org to rebuild the db. org-id-update-id locations doesn't get it done. org-element-cache-reset doesn't help.
 Repro: I'm not sure exactly what I do, but several undos and a save of my personal.org file got my follow from agenda to stop working (only some items, old items that used to work). Maybe I moved some orders around. But I'm looking right at a top level headline that i can't org-id-goto, even when I copy paste the id I'm staring right at in.
 ​
 Test: Refiling to another file and then trying the update and goto doesn't fix it. It's like the item is bugged. So here is the item just in case I'm being blind (note, this item was not touched recently and seems random that this wound up bugged... along with many others)
 * Test ** NEXT call xxxx for haircut SCHEDULED: <2023-03-01 Wed> A line with name and number (notes text anytime) :PROPERTIES: :ID: 272A86E5-E711-469C-8059-C7D11A4C8717 :END: :LOGBOOK: - State "DONE" from "WAITING" [2023-01-19 Thu 08:35] \\ haircut yesterday - State "WAITING" from "TODO" [2023-01-16 Mon 14:00] \\ texted - State "TODO" from [2023-01-15 Sun 08:47] :END: 
 Thanks for any and info. I don't use org-roam, and the only mentions of this issue seemed centered on that.
 ​
 EDIT: Another oddity, when trying to jump to the id in another file it would just fail to find it. After a restart I get the option to create the heading in the current file. So it seems to have gone from half broken to full broken.

 This works, but notice that isValid tediously repeats the argument x for all functions on the right. I'm wondering if there's a way to avoid this. I thought of the &&& Arrow operator, but as per my understanding, it'll output a 3-tuple, and I've to combine the values manually.

 for one of my college courses im using haskell, and the lecturer asked us to use quickcheck on a set (list) of functions, problem is, i don't know how i should check the property to the list, and GHC (ver 9.4.4) throws me errors each time i try to compile or change the type signature of the prop function to (Natural -> Natural)
 ​
 this is how the main function should look like according to the proffesor
 main :: IO () main = quickCheck $ prop_fac [fac1, fac2, fac3, fac4, fac5] 
 btw, for anyone interested, the quickcheck is for verifying all functions in the list are valid implementations of the factorial

 Often when working on a project there are a number of different org headings that are relevant. These headings are spread across files, and may even be children of each other.
 What I’d like is the ability to add headings to a group (possibly named) and then be able to either switch between them (like ido-switch-buffer) or open up all of them at once (in indirect buffers), or search within just those headings.
 You could go through and tag all of the headings, but this seems cumbersome, and it feels wrong to modify the heading rather than just pointing to it.
 All of my headings have ids, so I’m not worried about ambiguous references.
 I’ve seen packages that work in similar ways for collections of files, or buffers. But I haven’t seen one whose object is a heading.
 Do you know of a package that already exists like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, let me just say that I had written a huge text explaining what I was trying to do, but realized it was too much text and nobody has time for that. So I'll resume it as:
 I have this constructor:
 data Fruit = Apple {quantity :: Int, price :: Double} | Banana {quantity :: Int, price :: Double} | Grapes {quantity :: Int, price :: Double} 
 I have this list of lists:
 [["apple", "2", "1.50"], ["banana", "5", "2.15"], ["grapes", "4", "1.00"]] 
 I'm trying to build a function that iterates through the list of lists and that leverages the constructor above to access the second and third item in order to compute a total:
 total :: [[String]] -> [[Double]] 
 The result would be a list of lists of doubles:
 [[3.00], [10.75], [4.00]] 
 Questions
 Is something like this below valid or am I going in the wrong direction and should use instead some list comprehension or the map function, etc ?
 Notes:
  
qty = quantity
 p = price
 I assume I'll have to convert my list of lists to match the constructor types, or change my constructor to all String, and then convert right before computing numbers.
  
What I want it to do:
  
Grab first list.
 If "apple" is in the first list, then use getters to access the quantity and price.
 Call some function to compute the two numbers and add the result to first list of lists.
 Recursive call on the rest, which should be the next to lists with banana and grapes
  
​
 total :: [[String]] -> [[Double]] total (x : xs) | "apple" 'elem' x = computeFunction(qty, p) : total(xs) | "banana" 'elem' x = computeFunction(qty, p) : total(xs) | "grapes" 'elem' x = computeFunction(qty, p) : total(xs) 
 Something like this behavior --> [3.00] : [10.75] : [4.00] : []

That was the first step in improving the user experience and paved the way for many future enhancements.
Today we are announcing another update to the API, a new project name, jupyenv, and new features on the site.
You can now find the new site at jupyenv.io.
Why the name change?
We want to reach a bigger audience.
If you are a regular Nix user, jupyterWith is a good name.
It is analogous to the python.withPackages function in nixpkgs.
But outside of the Nix ecosystem, the with naming scheme is non-existent.
To better target people outside the Nix ecosystem, we are changing the name that emphasizes Jupyter environments (hence jupyenv).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Emacs community,
 I am stuck at a crossing road between Emacs, ERT, Geiser, SRFI 64 and Guile ! Too much for my current knowledge.
 I would like to evaluate a temporary buffer with Geiser. The said buffer is filled with a Guile script that should write to a file how many tests have been run with a SRFI 64 test suite.
 All of this is part of an ERT test that finally reads from the written file a number to compare to the expected.
 Unfortunately, my script does not seems to write anything to a file.
 If my explanations are not that clear, here is the script I am working on :
 https://framagit.org/Jeko/emacs-srfi64/-/raw/master/srfi64-test.el
 And here is the command line I use to run the ERT test :
 emacs -batch -l ert -l srfi64-test.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit 
 Thank you for anything you could bring to my attention !

If you run any of those commands while not inside the treemacs buffer, they do nothing. As soon as I place my cursor in the treemacs buffer, they work fine.
 Anybody have any advice on how to get this simple functionality?

 I was thinking about flipping the colour of the cursor but it doesn't seem to be possible without some ugly hacks. Also, I was thinking about flipping the theme itself but I think it's a bit too extreme
 For now I just switch cursor type to bar (from default box) but that's too subtle
 Any other suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title of the question may not do the justice for what I am seeking so I will try to describe my intent.
 I am already familiar with core functional programming concepts (ADT, pattern matching, lists, error handling, types, etc.) and I have been playing with Haskell for last few weeks and I am now comfortable with syntax and overall ecosystem.
 Now, I want to embark on the journey of solidifying my understanding of Haskell and theory behind it - basically trying to understand why things are the way they are. I understand that this puts me in mathematical domain (I did some intermediate maths in my higher college but mostly centered around physics - calculus, linear algebra, etc.).
 After endlessly trying to search for right starting point, I found myself stuck in Discrete Mathematics, Lambda Calculus, Set Theory, Category Theory and Abstract Algebra. I am vaguely familiar with these branches but absolutely have no clue how they or which one connects the dots with Haskell. I saw some introductory category theory video but it is just too abstract to understand at this stage.
 To reiterate, the goal is to get better understanding of Haskell concepts from more theoretical perspective and build a better mental model. The literature is literally countless. Where should I begin assuming good programming background but very little mathematical background?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched from Helm to Vertico+Consult+Marginalia, and so far I love almost everything about it. The one thing I really miss is having things set up so that when I execute a command that asks for a file, the completion defaults to a file at point.
 I know I can use M-n or PgDn to get to the next item in future history, which may be the eligible thing at point. But I orchestrate a lot of my work from an org file which has bare filenames in it, and it's handy to be able to do C-x C-f RET and open one of these files. Or C-x g (magit-status) RET and go straight to a git repository listed in the file.
 That said, I always had a little trouble when I tried one of these commands and point was on something I didn't want suggested, and I could never remember how to get back to whatever things would be like if it weren't. So maybe I should just deal with this. But more often than not, immediately suggesting the thing at point is what I want.
 I also tried Embark, and it immediately gave me errors, so I turned it off. Plus, I think I'd like to keep doing this in an action-suggest-enter mode rather than what Embark allows.
 Any suggestions for how to do what I want efficiently?

 My wife is preparing to open her medical practice in the next year. We've discussed that it would be nice to have a website where patients can book apppointments, receive reminder e-mails, read her medical notes, etc. I think it would be fun to do it myself.
 In the past, I've played around with Yesod to build simple prototypes, mostly for learning how to build web applications. However, back then, my biggest hurdle was deployment; I didn't know how to deploy and maintain a web application.
 My question is: what platform do you recommend I use to deploy a Haskell-based web application and a small database? I've taken a look at Heroku, and I've estimated the cost at about ~75$/mo. 
 Should I instead learn Nix and rent a dedicated server?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched to using Swiper and it's a great improvement but I'm missing something when searching in info-mode. Previously if I did a C-s search and the target wasn't found on the current info-mode page, a second C-s would continue searching in subsequent pages. Is there a way to have Swiper do this too?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s anything all the discourse and posturing of the last week has made abundantly clear: the Scala community needs an S-tier IDE.
 I am proud to announce a community initiative to achieve this goal. I am hoping this thread be a transparent forum for us to set the agenda going forward, and offer some suggestions to get the discussion going:
 - Let’s not re-invent the wheel. I propose we start with Ensime:TNG. This project is the seminal work of one of the most respected men in our community. The obvious alternative would be Metals, but let’s be real: Metals has made their bed with Scala Center, and Scala Center has proven to value Political Correctness over Commercial Success.
 - Minimize Distractions and Getting Stuff Done. I propose after this thread conclude we band together under a private github organization. This will prevent bad-faith actors from sabotaging our work, and it will protect you from being canceled for being a collaborator. I have already squatted some github orgs and domain names that could be used. Since I am the owner of these I will obviously benevolently administrate them.
 - Market the IDE. I’ve offered enough suggestions and I HATE marketing. Maybe others have an idea about how we do this. Perhaps a conference CFP? Does anyone know of any conferences happening later this year that will soon be accepting proposals?
 Looking forward to a fearless future with a grade “A” Scala IDE, long live Scala!

 main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "What number for multable?" input <- getLine let num = (read input:: Int) multable num multable :: Int -> IO () multable = do map inc[1..x] [1..x] inc :: [Int] -> Int -> IO () inc list i = do print (foldl (*) i list) 
 I think the problem is with the inc function where it needs bot list and integer input but I'm still completely baffled by haskell syntax..
 Help and feedback would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know how, but only recently I found out about Emacs, and I've been exploring PKM apps for a while. I'm looking for an environment in which I will do basically everything, and Emacs seems like the perfect solution for my needs.
 I have two questions. 
 (1) Are these features available within Emacs?
  
Bi-directional linking between pages and blocks (paragraphs), feature that is present in Roam, RemNote and Logseq
 Graph representation of all the connections between pages (concepts)
  
(2) Judging by my needs, is it worth it for me to devote my time to learning Emacs? How is "bad" the learning curve?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I mentioned that it would be nice to have some large example org files for testing, and to satisfy people that modern org deals very well with large files. I created such a file based on XML versions of all of Shakespeare's plays. It has about 33k headings, 150k lines, and a million words. I included the simple python parser in case people would like to play. The file itself consists mostly of nested headings with some styling. It might be good to add drawers, COLUMN properties, etc.
 On my org (emacs-mac 28.2, org 9.5.5, slow laptop) everything is super fast, except org-indent-mode, which takes ~30s to initialize; perhaps that could be done more lazily ala font-lock. Feel free to use or link to this however you like.

 The only thing that comes up in my searches is this reddit thread from 3 years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fro9jy/no_usable_sound_device_driver_found/
 aplay -l returns the following:
 **** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices **** card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC662 rev3 Analog [ALC662 rev3 Analog] Subdevices: 0/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 7: HDMI 1 [LG Ultra HD] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 8: HDMI 2 [HDMI 2] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 9: HDMI 3 [HDMI 3] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 1: Microphones [Blue Microphones], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 
 I also have pulseaudio installed.
 The OP of that reddit post found a workaround by running (start-process "aplay" nil "aplay" "/home/xyz/sounds/message.wav") but that doesn't seem to work for me either.
 i am using Manjaro if that helps.
 I would love to be able to use my chronos setup again! Any assistance or insight would be greatly appreciated!

 This release will probably also get called "0.3.0" soon. As we get closer to the new (Australian) academic year, my focus tends to shift from updating the library to updating my educational sites / OERs that use it. So, it will probably make sense to give this version the 0.3.0 moniker as several sites with materials will move to it.
 The most noticeable change is that DeckBuilder and Challenge are now in the doctacular package. Rather than having to, somewhat undocumented, import veautiful.templates.
 Some additional methods were also added to make it very quick to write and publish a single slide deck (e.g. from a scala-cli script). Roughly
 import com.wbillingsley.veautiful.html.* import com.wbillingsley.veautiful.doctacular.* import installers.* val root = mountToBody(<.p("loading")) given root.installMarked() DeckBuilder(1920, 1080) .markdownSlides("*Markdown text*") .veautifulSlide(<.div("Some components")) .mountToRoot(root) 
 Naturally, you can also install marked via webpack or any other means (as many of my sites do), but root.installMarked() which is available as an extension method in doctacular.installers provides a very short way to get a markdown parser in if you're just trying to publish a single deck from a script.
 Release notes here https://github.com/wbillingsley/veautiful/releases/tag/v0.3-M6
 API docs are on javadoc.io
 Documentation on https://www.wbillingsley.com/veautiful/ is slowly improving.
 Another example of something built with Veautiful is also up: the hour of code session run as part of the "Science Experience" outreach in Armidale on Jan 18th. Go on, see if you can win at Cards of Doom, or land your lander on the Moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 As a member of the Swarm developers, I am happy to announce a new release:
  
https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/releases/tag/0.3.0.0
  
Swarm is a 2D terminal programming game with its own language based on polymorphic lambda calculus.
 The big new feature is an LSP OnHover handling, so you can inspect the types of variables and description of predefined functions in Swarm language. The handler lives in LSP.hs and the code itself is in Hover.hs.
 ​
 OnHover demo with return command.
 Another fun thing is that the playable scenarios can now use arbitrary boolean expressions in their objectives (must form a DAG) so you can have alternative endings or lose early.
 Finally, a rather academic (but useful) improvement is pretty printing of the CESK machine that is used to execute Swarm code. If you run into a bug, at least you will be able to read what happened. :)
 There are many other fixes and improvements including several new playable scenarios and challenges. If you have any questions, feel free to ask here or raise an Issue.

Emacs, the text editor that lets you read mail and play Tetris, is often cast in opposition to the Unix philosophy of “do one thing well” and “combine small programs”. It’s a false dichotomy. Emacs can do a lot on its own and be combined usefully with other programs. 
 run‑command makes the combination convenient through a simple configuration format and an interaction flow that stays out of your way. Instead of reaching for a shell or a specialized major mode, you give run‑command a simple “recipe” and you get a contextual command palette where you can browse, select, and run commands without leaving Emacs.
  
Demo:
 https://i.redd.it/aufb2k4q2dfa1.gif
 I use this daily for compilers/linters in watch mode (think npm test:watch, cargo watch -x run, etc), development servers, and some one-off's (e.g. looking up the word at point in wordnet). For other examples of practical applications, check out the cookbook. For installation, quickstart etc see the website.

 If I do help(numpy.random), for example, the shell prints the line WARNING: terminal is not fully functional, and hitting RET then prints out the relevant documentation page by page, with a prompt at the end in the form of :.
  
  
1. How am I supposed to quit this documentation view? I usually hit q RET at the : prompt, which works, but I get a message reading NameError: name 'q' is not defined.
 
2. I can scroll down the help documentation using C-d (or hitting RET repeatedly), is there anyway to scroll up? Page-up just moves the buffer up, rather than scroll. I guess not, as even in a non-Emacs terminal running the interactive shell there isn't a way to do this. Is there a guide to motion/scrolling in inferior-shell-modes in general?

 This is what I typed and what shows in the terminal if I cat the file:
  (package! simpleclip :recipe (:host github :repo "rolandwalker/simpleclip")) 
 But from within Emacs, it changes what it displays to:  (package! simpleclip :recipe (:host github :repo "rolandwalker..."))  It basically truncates the string literal using an ellipses. I think this is confusing and I don't want it, but I've looked through docs and Google. Ultimately, I don't know what to even call this feature, so I can't really find out how to turn it off.
 Would someone please point me in the right direction?

Some of my diffs show multi-line regions of text that I know have moved into another file with a different file name. I suspend my ediff and find the other copy/copies of the moved text using helm-ag.
 Usually I would use compare-windows to compare the two buffers. However, often the org-mode headings are at a different level. E.G. everything might be promoted a level higher in one buffer than in the other.
 How can I compensate for this? Can I narrow a buffer to a temporary heading level? Or do I have to actually change the headings levels to match and then change them back afterwards?
 It's quite possible that one hunk of text will have been pushed into multiple other files, so I can end up comparing quite a few different files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I am in the process of learning a bit of Haskell and am trying to work out what is possible and impossible when playing with infinite lists.
 One "toy" problem I came up with was the idea of listing out all the possible integer-sided right triangles up to a max length.
 Of course, this is easy if I "pre-define" a triangles list with the max length already a part of it
  triangles maxLength = [(a, b, c) | a <- take maxLength [1..], b <- take maxLength [1..], c <- take maxLength [1..]] 
 and then use an "isRightTriangle" function as a filter for a rightTriangles maxLength function.
 But is it possible to have an infinite triangles list
  triangles = [(a, b, c) | a <- [1..], b <- [1..], c <- [1..]] 
 that is then later truncated for each tuple element? By that I mean essentially
  take 10 triangles 
 but where a take function operates on the individual infinite tuple elements? The above would of course give  [(1,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,1,4),(1,1,5),(1,1,6),(1,1,7),(1,1,8),(1,1,9),(1,1,10)] 
 rather than the combinations of (a, b, c) where each has had take 10 applied
 I understand this would not really be a great way to define things, but I am curious if this is doable or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historically, tooling hasn’t been the strongest aspect of the Haskell ecosystem. However, it has come a long way. A major contribution from the last few years is the Haskell Language Server (HLS). I wanted to learn more about GHC internals, and the general compilation pipeline. What better way to learn about these than to work on HLS, helping further improve Haskell tooling in the meanwhile?
In this post I will discuss the experience working on HLS during my internship at Tweag.

What is Haskell Language Server?
Before we move on to digging into the inner workings of HLS, let’s first take a look into what HLS is. Quoting the HLS documentation:
The haskell-language-server (HLS) project is an implementation of a server (a “language server”) for the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is the simplest way to add a list of strings to be considered as possible autocompletions when I try to autocomplete text within org-mode?
 In particular, I notice that in org-mode, M-TAB ultimately tries to autocomplete using the ispell dictionary. Is the best way therefore just to install ispell and add my strings to a user-defined ispell dictionary? That seems awkward.
 Or is it preferable simply to use lazy-completion-table to define a table, and then to define a custom completion function try-my-list which searches that table? Or does that depend on completion.el, which is the wrong thing to use in the textual context of org-mode?
 Basically, I'm confused by the variety of existing autocompletion and template technologies: abbrev, dabbrev, hippie-expand, skeleton, tempel, yasnippet, corfu, cape, etc.. I now use vertico, orderless, and marginalia, but I'm not sure which technology will fit best into this mix.

The big pain point is that the speed is an order of magnitude slower on my (newer) win laptop than the older linux one. Do you have any recommendations for this? I read somewhere that it might be related to the win filesystem and that using wsl doesn't really solve speed issues. Virtual boxing would complicate things exponentially I fear. Maybe there is some win-optimised build I am not aware of?! I installed emacs via scoop. Any suggestion is highly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I'm setting up a notes system in emacs using denote and related tools. I had been configuring consult-notes and saw a section on embark support in the readme. However, when I added that code to my init file, I get an error. (I don't know that this functionality is fully necessary but I figured it wouldn't hurt to add)
 Here is the code:
 (defun consult-notes-open-dired (cand) "Open notes directory dired with point on file CAND." (interactive "fNote: ") ;; dired-jump is in dired-x.el but is moved to dired in Emacs 28 (dired-jump nil cand)) (defun consult-notes-marked (cand) "Open a notes file CAND in Marked 2. Marked 2 is a mac app that renders markdown." (interactive "fNote: ") (call-process-shell-command (format "open -a \"Marked 2\" \"%s\"" (expand-file-name cand)))) (defun consult-notes-grep (cand) "Run grep in directory of notes file CAND." (interactive "fNote: ") (consult-grep (file-name-directory cand))) (embark-define-keymap consult-notes-map "Keymap for Embark notes actions." :parent embark-file-map ("d" consult-notes-dired) ("g" consult-notes-grep) ("m" consult-notes-marked)) (add-to-list 'embark-keymap-alist `(,consult-notes-category . consult-notes-map)) ;; make embark-export use dired for notes (setf (alist-get consult-notes-category embark-exporters-alist) #'embark-export-dired) 
 And the warning received when I start up emacs is "Symbol's function definition is void: embark-define-keymap"
 ​
 Is there something I need to change about the code? Or do I need to add something to my configuration of embark (which I can paste into a comment if requested)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 ​
 We've put together a small addition to the hasql ecosystem: hasql-listen-notify (GitHub source).
 ​
 Users may be already familiar with hasql-notifications, the first library in the hasql ecosystem to provide asynchronous notification support. So here are a few reasons you may consider switching:
 ​
 - More "hasqly" API featuring Session where appropriate.
 - No dependency on hasql-pool.
 - Safer identifier escaping that uses PQescapeIdentifier() rather than a custom Haskell implementation.
 - More minimal/fundamental poll / await combinators for receiving notifications, rather than a monolithic waitForNotifications that accepts a callback.
 - Correct reconnection handling: it's possible for a libpq connection object to be temporarily disconnected from Postgres, and this library will not throw an exception in this case.
 - Backend PID from notification payload is not thrown away.
 ​
 Thanks and don't hesitate to file an issue or ask a question.

 All 5 of these programs do exactly the same thing: print "Fibonacci Numbers", then "F(0) = 0", "F(1) = 1", and so on, up to "F(19) = 4181".
 My Haskell version is below. It works fine, but I'm not a Haskell expert, and I'm wondering how others would do it. So, how would you write this and/or do you have any comments on my code? (Keep in mind that I want my code to be nicely organized, modular, and understandable to relative newbies; this isn't code golf.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For consult users (or the consult curious) minad just added a wonderful new feature to consult: consult-info. I bind it to M-s i. You can choose one or more info manuals to search (comma separated), and then it acts much like consult-grep and friends, searching over the info nodes. 
 Really great for quickly peeking at some topic without the usual rigamarole of entering Info. It's also simple to bind a key to a command to go right to searching your most used info nodes.
 If you add embark into the mix, the power amplifies again: you can narrow down to just the search terms you want using the regular consult "two stage" filtering (e.g #process#async), then embark-export these live filtered results to a Collections buffer, effectively building your own clickable custom index (or three) for the topic(s) you are investigating.
 Clearly the fastest way to RTFM. Take that Google.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use projectile to manage different project directories. Say I have in project A a .projectile; whenever I start emacs, I can do projectile-switch-to-project and I can choose project A out of the list.
 Here, say in project A, I open many files: fileB, fileC, fileD...etc. Let's say I have fileB takes up the whole window (via C-x 0) . I can then easily switch between existing files that I have opened with projectile-display-buffer . I can then choose the buffer/files I want and press Enter. This is all good.
 The problem is this would switch to that buffer but split the screen horizontal. Using the current example, I have fileB and using projectile-display-buffer and pick fileC would result in a horizontal split: fileB on the left, fileC on the right. How do I customize this behavior, i.e. what if I do not want it to split or if I want it to split vertically instead of horizontally?

 I never saw it in any language I tried before, even full bloated node projects can build the first time faster that It took me to run a hello world. 
 There is any trick/config/black magic to speed it up?
 It will take all this time each time I add new dependencies or change sbt version? 
 It's not just my connection with maven central since it took a lot of time on the "(this may take some time)" thing before even start downloading jars, I also work with Java I never saw it before.
 Edit: I deleted some sbt caches and tried to run it with gnomon and I had this output 
 ``` sbt run | gnomon 4.1159s copying runtime jar... 167.3534s copying runtime jar...-sbt sbt 1.8.0 (this may take some time)... 168.2152s copying runtime jar...2.17 (for sbt)... 0.6487s [info] welcome to sbt 1.8.0 (N/A Java 17.0.6) 0.1416s [info] loading project definition from /home/OP/projects/th eunamed/project 7.4709s [warn] jline-2.14.6.jar no longer exists at /home/OP/.cache /coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/jline/jline/2.14.6/jline- 2.14.6.jar 0.0947s [info] loading settings for project theunamed from build.sbt ... 204.1043s [info] set current project to TheUnamed (in build file:/home/OP /projects/theunamed/) 1.4517s [info] compiling 1 Scala source to /home/OP/projects/theuna med/target/scala-3.2.1/classes ... 0.1659s [info] done compiling 0.0638s [info] running helloWorld 0.0223s Hello, world 0.3625s [success] Total time: 206 s (03:26), completed Jan 30, 2023, 11:55: 52 AM 0.0001s

 ```
 More than 6 minutes and seems that It even doesn't need to download the project dependencies, It loaded jars and configurations related to sbt only in the slowest steps.

Convince yourself of the previous claim (that the lifting operation can be generalized) about 'ReaderT' by writing and comparing several MonadMn instances for 'ReaderT'.
  
Here's the instance for MonadError found online.
 liftThroughReaderT :: m a -> ReaderT r m a liftThroughReaderT x = ReaderT $ const x class (Monad m) => MonadError e m | m -> e where throwError :: e -> m a catchError :: m a -> (e -> m a) -> m a instance (MonadError e m, MonadError e ((->) r)) => MonadError e (ReaderT r m) where throwError e = liftThroughReaderT $ throwError e catchError m h = ReaderT $ catchError (runReaderT m) (runReaderT . h) 
 I understand the notation m -> e means "e is determined by m". What does e ((->) r) mean?

 How would you convince a Kotlin convert to use Scala again?
 Well, that "enjoyer" is me.

I would say that I'm a mid-level dev for whom Scala is not a primary point, but an important part of it.
 I really liked Scala, although it was hard at first. I had to switch my mind's gears from "everything's mutable" imperative mindset to a functional one where immutability & referential transparency is king. That whole functional mindset made me a better programmer. I now make sure to be clear & separate on…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I would like to share a couple of packages I have been using for some time for FPGA/ASIC design and verification:
 - https://github.com/gmlarumbe/verilog-ext/
 - https://github.com/gmlarumbe/vhdl-ext/
 These add some extensions to SystemVerilog/VHDL and are built on top of Emacs `verilog-mode' and `vhdl-mode' respectively.
 Here are some of their current features:
  
Tree-sitter support (requires Emacs 29)
 Improve syntax highlighting
 Hierarchy extraction and navigation (verilog-ext)
 LSP configuration for `lsp-mode` and `eglot`
 Support for many linters via flycheck
 Improve imenu entries: detect instances, classes and methods
 Code navigation functions for RTL and Verification environments
 Beautify modules and instances (verilog-ext)
 Extended collection of custom and yasnippet templates insertion via hydra
 Additional misc utilities (e.g. code formatter integration for Verilog)
  
Looking forward to receiving some feedback! And contributions are of course also welcome! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am confused by the Tramp documentation regarding the auto save feature. According to the documentation (emphasis mine):
  
4.20 Auto-save, File Lock and Backup configuration 
 To avoid TRAMP from saving backup files owned by ‘root’ to locations accessible to others, default backup settings in backup-directory-alist have to be altered. 
 Here’s a scenario where files could be inadvertently exposed. Emacs by default writes backup files to the same directory as the original files unless changed to another location, such as ~/.emacs.d/backups/. Such a directory will also be used by default by TRAMP when using, say, a restricted file /su:root@localhost:/etc/secretfile. The backup file of the secretfile is now owned by the user logged in from TRAMP and not ‘root’. 
 When backup-directory-alist is nil (the default), such problems do not occur. 
  
First, it states that the default value of backup-directory-alist must be changed to avoid saving root files as a normal user in a local directory.
 But then, it says that it does not happen with the default value.
 When running Emacs (both -q and -Q, master from Dec 4th), it behaves like the first paragraph: when opening a file using su (or remote ssh+su), it warns about writing a local backup and aborts opening if you say no. Therefore, it looks like the last sentence "When backup-directory-alist is nil (the default), such problems do not occur. " is wrong.
 Is it actually wrong, or am I misunderstanding it?

 What is Iron?
 Iron is a refined types system. It enables the user to attach constraints to types, checkable at compile-time or/and runtime.
 scala val x: Int :| Positive = -1 //Does not compile! 
 This is especially useful to avoid invalid domain values:
 ```scala case class User(name: String :| Alphanumeric, age: Int :| Positive)
 User("John", -35) //Does not compile! User("John_", 35) //Does not compile! User("John", 35) //Compiles ```
 Or, at runtime using Eithers:
 ```scala def createUser(name: String, age: Int): Either[String, User] for validName <- name.refineEither[Alphanumeric] validAge <- age.refineEither[Positive] yield User(validNam…]]></summary>

 Is there some programmatic way of knowning which keys or key combinations are not used in a particular window?
 Of course they will be some additional modes which might be using other keys not used by normal/evil, so should be accounted for as well.
 I'm looking for keys on the main row, ie excluding the Function, Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys and numeric keys. That will be limiting, but any routine which can list unused keys in any mode will be fine.

 I bought a MacBook, but it has very little storage space. I learned that emacs can use configuration and rich plug-ins to achieve many functions, such as code editing, document editing, markdown editing, rendering and so on. In addition, I am a programmer, and I usually write some java, scala, python, shell, Go, Rust, nodejs, and a very comprehensive code language assistance is also very useful! Any caring veterans here to tell me how I should be able to start this journey? Or a configuration to let me just dash forward?
 I'm so so sorry about my poor english,
 But I think everyone can feel my appeal, thank you again!

 would make the list into [2,4,6,8] in ghci but what if I wanted to premake the list [1,2,3,4] so that when I call doublemap it will become [2,4,6,8] without having to add the list on ghci.

 This is for a homework question but it isn't close to the actual problem and I am just learning Haskell. I hope this doesn't break the rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I'm learning haskell and also interested in functional programming relatively newly. I used to develop in many programming languages such as Rust, Ruby, Python, C++, C#, Java, Kotlin and Swift. So I got used to all those programming approaches, design patterns etc. After all, I had seen the functional programming way and really loved the idea and that gave me another way of thinking. I'm still learning. 
 I think I understood what a monad is, even that knowledge helped me in oop way of programming. And now I'm learning about monad transformers. I have read a few blogs and pages about them but they are still not that clear to me. 
 Could anyone please explain those to me? Maybe with examples or comparisons to oop. 
 Because such questions always have answers out there but they are usually either so high level therefore only the ones who have experience in the field can understand or so basic examples and information that no one can properly understand the "needs" and the importance of it so it becomes useless. It is why I'm asking here to the community. 
 Thank you for your answers in advance

 Before adding the above line everything in my config was fine. But now it messed up all the formatting in my config.org file like the following example:

 It now creates errors when I load up doom emacs since the config.org was tangled into config.el. I am trying to figure out how to fix the formatting and I am not sure why some of the brackets are red since I never had any issues before.

 tldr; Probably a total noob Q, but I need to edit my config.yaml file on the headless pi running my HA instance. That file needs to be accessed as my home assistant user (not the regular user of my local or remote machine)
 I can:
  
Edit the file remotely:
  
 $ ssh me@raspberry_pi $ sudo -u homeassistant -H -s $ nano /filepath 
  
Visit my regular user's files in emacs:
  
``` SPC .
 /ssh:me@raspberry_pi:/file/path ```
 I am struggling to understand what I need to do within emacs to replicate (1). 
 The main issue I'm finding baffling is the logical jump from editing as my normal user, to editing as the HA user (a user setup with no password). 
 Is anyone able to explain to me like I'm 5?
 Also, maybe a doom emacs issue, but tramp crashes emacs a lot. For example if I mistype a password or file path. Which during trying to figure out the above has caused me to enter many a killall emacs into my terminal emulator

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I am trying to create an Elisp link in an Org document that would display an agenda view matching a particular tag in the current buffer.
 Here is what I could do so far:
 [[elisp:(org-agenda nil "m" t)][test]] 
 This opens a "match" agenda view with a restriction on the current buffer. However I still have to choose the tag.
 Is there any way to pass the tag programmatically? I'd prefer to avoid tricks such as executing a saved keyboard macro.
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recent JDG article (won't link it, you can easily find it) mentioned the new Caprese project and hypothesized that it could turn into a Scala 4. Is that really the plan? That seems really bad for Scala adoption/investment in industry.
 I understand that Martin Odersky is an academic and his job is to do language research, not necessarily support industry or Scala adoption, so it's not for me to say that Caprese isn't the best way to do that. However, I think it would be much better for it to be released as a completely separate language as opposed to the next version of Scala. Scala 3 is awesome as a language but it was disruptive to commercial efforts in Scala. I am not sure we can take another hit like that.

 - beOrg defaults to using it's org dir in iCloud... is there a way I can link my current ~/org into iCloud? I move between mac and pc and would rather not make my org dir live directly in the clould dir and then need to link out.
 - People mention webdav, are people still rolling their for this?
 - Working Copy would work but then everything has to go through a commit, which seems silly. (I use github, but not for everytime I check off an item).
 ​
 Anyway... what's your setup and how do you like it?

 I want to add line on the 80 character mark. Rather simple think right? But Customizing Emacs is so overwhelming, that I don't even know how to do it. 
 Is there some config file? Is every customizing option in M-x customizing menu? How to save such a settings globally, to have it whenever I run Emacs? 
 Thank you for you answers.

 When I start the interpreter on a default emacs install in Ubuntu, it seems that I can only enter one command at a time. How do I get the interpreter in the bottom window to run all of my code in the top window? Why do I have to re-enter my code into the bottom window? Sorry if this is an obvious question, but I can't seem to figure it out myself
