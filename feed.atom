 But on new linux distros you can't install tinytag via pip and your system python package. You have to install it into a virtual environment. 
 My question is, on new linux distros how do I set emms to use tinytag as installed in a python virtual environment? Do I activate the virtual environment and then set emms-info-tinytag-python-name to the path of python in the virtual environment?
 Thanks for any help.

 One of the most important topics in IT is surely the security, it's so complicated and intriguing that, either you love it or you hate it, but we can't help taking care of it. Nowadays, in a society based on computers and applications, crackers attacks are very concrete and dangerous. In my opinion, when we talk about IT security, it is always better to overestimate the risk and have a large margin of tolerance. The (hard) trade-off we have to make is that the solution is usable, has good performance, and is safe.
  
Often, it is not a single solution that makes something safe; it is the sum of several approaches that mitigate the risk.

 It has been a while since I had my first idea for a library that would help developers securely manage secret values within their app…]]></summary>

 Here is an example of what I mean:
 | col1 | col2 | col3 | col4 | | test | 1 | | | | test2 | 5 | -4 | 6 | | test3 | 4 | 1 | 9 | #+TBLFM: @3$3..@>$3=@-1$2-@0$2::@3$4..@>$4=@-1$2+@0$2 
 In col3 I show the result of subtracting the value in col2 in the current row from the value col2 in the previous row. col4 does the same with adding the rows
 But what if I wanted to have two table. One for the input data (col1, col2) and one for the calculated data (col3, col4)
 I tried it like this
 #+TBLNAME: data | col1 | col2 | | test | 1 | | test2 | 5 | | test3 | 4 | | col3 | col4 | | | | | -4 | 6 | | 1 | 9 | #+TBLFM: @3$1..@>$1=remote(data,@-1$2)-remote(data,@0$2)::@3$2..@>$2=remote(data,@-1$2+@0$2) 
 But it throws an error that "Row descriptor -1 leads outside table". Obviously because the relative positions are not based on the second table

 So I had this interview with this big company where the interviewer was quite experienced.

Now the role for which they were hiring was Full Stack Dev, however this dude started with problem solving. 
 He asked me first which language would like to pick, so I told him that I would prefer using JavaScript/C++ and then he responded oh don't you know Java? Look I don't hate Java …]]></summary>

As part of publishing, I export the notes as txt, insert them into an FTS5 SQLite table and I added a small reactive app to an existing server to search and display the results. Everything works well but I recently used docsify at work and thought it was superb so I started thinking about client-side searching. I've thought about the following:
  
modify my export to markdown, generate the appropriate sidebar file and setup docsify in the normal way. My primary objection is the markdown exporter's quality is unknown. This would also cut my publish time down significantly and wouldn't be too much work.
 index the HTML (Note: getting this only do the relevant piece was difficult the last time I tried as tags and metadata blew up the results) as part of the publishing process and add a Javascript library that gets included in every exported HTML file. We'll call this the stork model. While slightly slower than the previous option, this would also reduce publishing time substantially.
  
What other solutions occur to you?
 edit: I ended up doing the first one. It took a couple of hours to convert.

 Are there any emacs packages that include commands for taking the text in the active region and switching between bold, italic, etc using unicode substitutions? 
 ie like these kinds of text generators.

 I realize such a generator can't handle every character, but I want it just for highlighting words in comments, etc. 
 Tnx!

 I've read the manual and it seems Emacs on Adroid (my Android version is 13) doesn't have the ability to access the system clipboard - indeed it seems to be that way.
 Is there really no way to copy/paste - share data with other apps? For simple things - like cope a website's URL in Firefox and paste it to a document in Emacs?

 But what about lines without soft newline characters? When I open mails in mu4e, all longer lines are nicely wrapped. The lines though that can be shown completely in the buffer stick out and are not wrapped, and this looks ugly and makes reading harder because of the long lines. (See the attached screenshot. The lines at the end are much longer than the wrapped ones above.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have set up a simple server with scala+cask (I have set the port to 51934 and the host to be "0.0.0.0"). I was getting connection timeouts when I was trying to connect from a different PC in the local network and when I ran netstat -an | grep LISTEN I got the following output:
 ​
 tcp 0 0 127.0.0.53:530.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:6310.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:220.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:54320.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::51934 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:8212:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:45459:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:44569:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:35383:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::22 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::5432 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 ::1:631 :::* LISTEN
 ​
 Now, the third entry on that output is my ssh server which is accessible from everywhere. The first tcp6 entry is the server I am trying to set up now. I see it being listed as tcp6. So I guess I have two questions:
 - Is this an issue (that is my guess)
 - How can I configure the cask server so that it uses tcp instead of tcp6?

If dir-a and dir-b are far away from each other, this may take a lot of keystrokes.
 This could be made easier, if insert-file would allow me to jump to a bookmarked directory (which might be closer to dir-b). Do you know any such solution ?
 Please note, that in this special use-case (insert-file), the command bookmark-bmenu-list (or similar) does not provide an alternative as far as I can see.

 I'll be using it with servant probably if that changes anything.

They both support deconstructing ideas in a tree structure, except that mindmaps offer a spatial way of arranging items, while the outliner does it as a list. I like to mindmap first and then turn it into an outline.
 I figured out a dead simple way of doing it that doesn't involve messing around with freeplane plugins that export to Org-mode. (I tried one, it didn't work for me.) The One Downside - It only works with the nodes, not it's properties like attributes and notes.
 Step 1
  
Open Freeplane, go to Format > Manage Styles > Edit Styles (Or just hit C+f11).
 On the branch called Automatic level styles, select the top level node
 On the right side pane are the controls. Scroll down to Core Text and in the field called Format add this: * %…]]></summary>

 I'm new to programming and am learning Python!
 I decided to go with Emacs, and you might be asking why. Well, I've dabbled a bit with Emacs in the past, and I'm intrigued by its feature set, which I believe could greatly enhance my programming-fu. I'm using Termux with an external keyboard because I do not have access to a computer. Is my approach off-base? Is there a significant difference between using emacs vs emacs -nw ? Can I just stick to the vanilla setup for programming in Python?
 Your insights are greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

Being a newbie, I thought "great, lets clear those out" and I followed the instructions to delete them. On restarting this morning, I realised that the deleted packages were my Modus-themes, Golden-ratio and pdf-tools (with other pdf related files), all of which are loaded every time I start emacs and essential to my newbie workflow.
 Does emacs have a habit of suggesting that you delete files that are actually used and setup in your init.el? ..or more likely, what am I doing wrong that emacs suggested that I delete them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this question has been asked before, I want to learn Haskell and I have very little programming experience(only Python & some robotics C) and I'm conflicted at the moment.
 My roadmap is:
  
HFTVB by John Whitington or the Haskell Wikibook
 Write yourself a Scheme tutorials
 Learn Haskell by Building a Blog Generator by Gilmi.
  
Is it worth buying on HFTVB? Or is the Wikibook good enough? Or more importantly, am I being redundant since all of the above are focused on beginners? As in, would it be better to just jump into LHBG?
 By looking at the options above, you'll notice that I have:
  
A preference for text over video courses.
 A phobia from large books which I see recommended on here. I like things succinct where the questions lead me to discover more of the material and where I am left with space to figure things out for myself.
  
I know at this point this is quite a repetitive question, but I'm really interested in starting as soon as possible and would like not to go through the phase of trying out a 1000 unrelated things until I figure out which is right for me, I know my preferences and prefer sticking to them.
 I also read about LYAH, and while it seems quaint the no exercises disqualifies it immediately from the race. I like my resources jam-packed with exercises.

Get all the files called "file_contexts" found. For that I could use consult-find, right?
 
Then get all these files as an input for consult-ripgrep somehow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR - How do I incorporate backlink searches into my org-ql queries?
 ​
 I am re-structuring my notes to adapt to new demands. I really like the non-hierarchical approach where individual notes are org-mode headers (or files) with an ID property that I can simply link to.
 Org-ql is fantastic at querying org-mode headers, keeping dynamic blocks based on those queries, etc. Using org-ql, I can also query for links within a heading. What I am missing is the option to query for backlinks TO the heading. Has anyone solved this problem?
 ​
 Simple example:
 * Drug A :drug: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 12345 :END: This is an inhibitor of [[id:54321][Protein X]]. * Protein X :protein: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 54321 :END: This is a trans-membrane protein that is over-expressed in breast cancer. 
 If I'm interested in the a subset of inhibitor drugs that are linked to Protein X I can do:
 [[org-ql-search:(and (rifle "inhibitor") (link "Protein X"))]] 
 But what about finding trans-membrane proteins are associated with (i.e. "backlinked to") inhibitors?
 ​
 OR - maybe there is a way to use org-ql results as org-ql query inputs? For example: 
  
Query 1: pull out all drugs.
 Query 2: pull out all proteins.
 Query 3: identify all proteins (from Query 2) that have a backlink to drugs (from Query 1).
  
​
 I'm a bit stuck. Any help or pointers would be appreciated.

 I noticed that a VSCode Haskell plugin expects a GHCup setup. I am thinking of forking my own code and experimenting with just using Cabal and GHCup installed tools, and also get rid of my stack.yml files in each project directory.
 A few years ago it seemed that stack removed many of the pain points I had with Haskell but now I am re-evaluating that belief.
 Any advice will be appreciated!!

 Release notes:
  
After an upgrade from an earlier version of Stack, on first use only, Stack 2.15.1 may warn that it had trouble loading the CompilerPaths cache.
 The hash used as a key for Stack's pre-compiled package cache has changed, following the dropping of support for Cabal versions older than 1.24.0.0.
  
Changes since v2.13.1:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack does not leave *.hi or *.o files in the setup-exe-src directory of the Stack root, and deletes any corresponding to a setup-<hash>.hs or setup-shim-<hash>.hs file, to avoid GHC issue #21250.
 If Stack's Nix integration is not enabled, Stack will notify the user if a nix executable is on the PATH. This usually indicates the Nix package manager is available. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tldr; Looking for packages for customizing dired listings.
 Howdy. I've recently gotten an "Emacs splinter" about the format of dired directory listings and after playing with dired-listing-switches I've determined there are not enough knobs there to allow me to filter out some of the stuff I want to filter out. I see that I can write some custom filters also which might take me where I want to go but my elisp skills are still somewhat meager and I have quite a lot on my plate already.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for elisp packages already in the ecosystem which might be a quick win here? More so to filter the contents of the listings and not so much, for example, colors (ex:diredfl).
 thx!

 That doesn't show a useful hint in the which-key-pop-up.
 The use-package doc says that is uses the function (bind-key) so something like this should work, but actually doesn't:
 (use-package emacs :bind (("C-c C-k" . ("backward-kill-line" . (lambda () (interactive) (kill-line 0))))) 
 Am I just missing some syntactical finesse or is what I want not possible with use-package's :bind?

 Can someone aid me in doing it? I am sure some of have done it or at least know what I need to do for adapting packages. I heard you shouldn't install as if it was vanilla emacs, but I only starting to understand what that means.

Similarly, a directory called skelton is provided, which acts as a template for the project. This makes the setup easy to understand. I used to search how to create an Emacs Lisp project every time I created one, but since I created this one, I don't need to do that anymore. I announced this package to the Emacs community in my country, and it was so well received that I am announcing it here on Reddit as well. I hope you will Star it if you like!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the other day I spent more than 3 seconds renaming eat buffers, so I decided to spend more than 3 days to make my own package that does it automatically. After finishing, I found that if you launch eat with a prefix argument it does exactly what I wanted.
 Nevertheless, this package has more features (like updating the indexes when a buffer is closed & more formatting options) and not only it works for eat, but for everything that when launched checks if the buffer already exists and uses that instead of creating a new one (I only tested vterm and eat) so it can be used as a simple replacement to multi-vterm and multi-term.
 I really recommend the experience. I've been using emacs for about a year, and even though you do learn by making your config, making a package gives you a waaay higher level of understanding, even if it's a basic one like mine.
 I tried to make the best code I could, but I'm no elisp/lisp programmer, but a C one, so probably the style isn't exactly right. There are a few features I didn't add yet and it could be way better documented.
 Here's the link for anyone interested: https://gitlab.com/vslavkin/multi-buffer.el
 Edit: not sure if the name is good or not, please tell me if you have a better alternative

 Suppose that the buffer has this: ( ] ). If the cursor is at (, emacs shows ] as the (mis)matching parenthesis. Is it possible somehow to make emacs show ) as the matching parenthesis (meaning that emacs should ignore all the other kinds of parenthesis when searching for the pair)?

 I'm still using Emacs-w32 from Cygwin and I start it elevated:
 cygstart --action=runas run emacs-w32 
 so I can edit "privileged" files.
 I wonder if WSL's Emacs could be a "system" tool - could I ditch Cygwin completely (having X Server backported by Microsoft to Win 10)...
 It could be frustrating to switch text editor just to edit hosts file...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I am learning haskell from this resource: https://learn-haskell.blog/04-markup/04-parsing_02.html
 and I cannot understand certain function call, I mean this one:
 maybe id (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) 
 from this block:
  parse :: String -> Document parse = parseLines Nothing . lines -- (1) parseLines :: Maybe Structure -> [String] -> Document parseLines context txts = case txts of [] -> maybeToList context -- (2) -- Paragraph case currentLine : rest -> let line = trim currentLine in if line == "" then maybe id (:) context (parseLines Nothing rest) -- (3) else case context of Just (Paragraph paragraph) -> parseLines (Just (Paragraph (unwords [paragraph, line]))) rest -- (4) _ -> maybe id (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) trim :: String -> String trim = unwords . words 
 especially this part:
 (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) 
 Let's say we call this function with context = Nothing and txts = ["abc", ""]
 so firstly we go to this case:
 maybe id (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) 
 and now is the part I don't understand, (:) context in this case is (Nothing : any list that parseLines will return) so Nothing will be prepend to a list of paragraphs, but when Im calling this function in ghci it just returns [Paragraph "abc"] without nothing, but manually calling (Nothing: [Just $ Paragraph "abc"]) returns a list with Nothing at the beginning. 
 Can someone explain this, please?

This is all reflected in Apple Mail in iOS and on the Mac as well. However, the Sent Mail doesn't seem to sync in the same way. If I send an email with Mu4e, it will save it to the designated "icloud/Sent Messages" locally, and I can see it in mu4e. But I can't see it in Apple Mail at all. It's simply not synced. All the other folders are except for this one. Also, Sent items from Apple Mail do not sync to mu4e either.
 Is there something that I'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the first packages I setup in emacs when I began using it were projectile and perspective. I primarily use emacs as an IDE and wanted to be able to manage different projects. Google said these were good so I started there. Two months on and I still don't have a single perspective set and projectile feels like I'm using a semi truck to tow a hand cart. I've only not removed projectile because it integrates with tree-macs and I'm hoping to set it up so that I can have tree-macs display my list of folders when I'm not working on a project and only the project root of the current working directory when I'm in a python/c++ project. Tree-macs has a variable that allows you to set it to display a single directory and I'm wondering if that can be done with a .dir-local.el file, eliminating the one thing I think would make projectile worth having. I'd also like to exclude folders with .gitignore but again, I wonder if there is a way to do that with tree-macs or project.el.
 So, my question. What do you guys use perspective and projectile for. As a hobby programmer, do you think it's worth having? What are your thoughts on project.el and what else is out there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I shared this on my blog earlier this week:
https://christiantietze.de/posts/2024/02/example-object-tag-vs-topic-tag-programming-zettelkasten/
So I talked with a fellow iOS developer about tagging recently, then overhauled a note I found by accident and shared this as an example.
The gist is:
I increased specificity of tags. The general #image  becomes → #uiimage on iOS, #nsimage on macOS, which are actual types in the macOS API.
I removed the topic tag #appkit which doesn't tell me anything interesting here.
Why is the object tag #appkit useless now? Almost all my programming notes are about macOS and thus #appkit, the macOS UI API framework. So it doesn't help find anything, and it'd produce so many notes that it becomes useless. Thousands, if applied consistently!
There are notes about the AppKit framework as a topic. These stay put, of course!
The thing is: for my very first notes on programmatic image manipulation, it sounded sensible to use a tag like #image.  After all, I did not expect to need specificity here at all: "something with image in Appkit" sounded good. But with expertise, I need NSImage-related resources, and I can name contexts better. Like embedding images in text views, as wirh The Archive 
All notes are malleable, so no problem.
By the way, new notes on similar topics I tag with the very specific API titles right away, e.g. #nsimage for image stuff on Mac. This changed in the past couple of years and I don't have to think about this, at all. I believe it felt similar back when I used the """bad""" tag. So chances are I could discover even more specific tags in the future and find the current one lacking   At the moment, it's the best topic tag I know to describe this.]]></summary>

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
I am exploring the idea of when my body is in motion and when it is at rest, it interacts with inertia.
How do I modify the format of my wikilinks to something more generic? I feel for @ZettelDistraction's pain, and he modified his file names and the links in his ZK. Just the thought of attempting this hurts my little brain.
I'm thinking about adulting my Monk Mornings.
I use my ZK in support of my university literature and writing coursework.
Things I'm reading:
Quintero, Isabel. Gabi, a girl in pieces. 2014.
Picard, Max. The world of silence. 1948.
Gardner, Dwight. UPSTAIRS DELICATESSEN: on eating, reading, reading about eating, and eating while reading. 2024.
Yoon, Nicola. The sun is also a star. 2016.
Music I'm listening to:
Schiller
Kaleo
Hania Rani
A look at my ZK work themes:
1/19 zettel - meta zettelkasting
★★★★★
The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

 When I try to use them though, I get an error: "all-the-icons isn't installed"
 Now, I know all-the-icons isn't installed. The reason is because it was apparently taken out of Doom Emacs in favor of "nerd-icons" which I had to install instead when first setting up Doom. But from this error message, I'm gathering that Neotree needs, or at least is specifically looking for, all-the-icons.
 Is there a way to tell Neotree to use the icons from the font I have installed? It just won't even turn on at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently setting up my capture templates and want to do the following.
  
Create a file if it doesn't exist yet
 Give it a level 1 heading of the current date
 Give it two level 2 headings "Journal" and "activities"
 Have one capture template that creates entries under "Journal" and another one that creates entries uner "activities"
  
I have 1 - 3 implemented and everything works so far. My problem is 4. My capture template for "Journal" looks like this:
 ("ja" "Journal" entry
 (file+olp (lambda()(rmz/create-org-file)) (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d") "Journal")
 "* %<%H:%M %p> - %?")
 So the first thing in the target is a call to a function that creates the file if it doesn't exist and then returns the file name (works). Then I want to create the olp. The level 1 heading needs to be created dynamically while the second ("journal") is static. This is what the documentation says about it:
 (file+olp "path/to/file" "Level 1 heading" "Level 2" ...)
 For non-unique headings, the full outline path is safer
 If I only add "Journal" as olp in the target emacs throws the error "Heading not found on level 1: Journal" (Sounds different in the documentation)
 If I pass the call to format-time-string emacs throws this error "Wrong type argument: stringp, (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")
 Any ideas how I can pass a dynamic heading in the targets olp?

I know how to use space-mark in combination with whitespace-display-mapping to convert ALL spaces to a dot, but in all honesty, that isn't really helpful. I would rather like to be able to call out spaces that appear before tabs, and also spaces that appear after tabs.
 If I simply use space-before-tab and space-after-tab, without space-mark, I am able to see these spaces because they have a different background color (I modified my theme)... but that all goes away when my cursor goes to the line where these spaces are (I have global-hl-line-mode on). I'd like to have these spaces still be visible in this case, preferably with a space-mark. Is this achievable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did an "update all" from melpa today and one or more upgrades breaks a lot of functionality for me. It broke things both on emacs 29 running on manjaro i3 and on emacs 28 running in pop os so it doesn't seem a version related issue. The first thing I noticed, for instance, is that which-key stopped working, despite "which-key" not being one of the packages upgraded. Is there a way to narrow down the culprit?
 This was the list of packages to upgrade:
 (auctex-14.0.0 company-20240208.1943 doom-modeline-20240205.139 flycheck-20240208.2142 helm-descbinds-20240206.802 magit-20240206.2256 mastodon-20240201.1500 org-noter-20240207.2329 org-ref-20240208.1801 transient-20240201.1100 visual-fill-column-20240205.1505).
 Is there a way to upgrade each one in turn and see which one is interfering with the others? For some reason I'm confused how to just upgrade one package in melpa at a time. It only seems possible to install a newer version over an older.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming from an OOP background, I'm finding it difficult to write elisp, for Emacs. I've tried looking for guides, but I haven't found information on how to structure the code of a coherent package.
 Particularly, it's been hard for me to keep track of the code in my mind because I'm using mostly plain functions and not many data structures. And the code is so far in one big file, which I don't know how to split up, as opposed to classes, which are more conceptually modular. How should I make my code more modular? How should I decide when I need to make a new function?
 If I need to visit and insert text into a buffer, should the visit and insert be done at the lowest, i.e. most nested, level possible? Or should I wrap the whole function body in a with-current-buffer?
 If I find myself needing to store a lot of data in variables, am I doing it wrong? I'm not using setq, because it seems like overkill and ugly being global, but even with let and let*, keeping track of what variables have been declared and their scope is getting difficult.
 Should I not declare as many variables and instead make monolithic functions where variable's aren't assigned, rather you just evaluate an expression (xyz) inside the expression you would pass the variable to, i.e. (abc (xyz)) instead of (setq var (xyz)) then (abc var)? I feel like this gets hard to read once you have a lot of nested expressions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been messing with this problem for a while now, off and on for months, really, and it's driving me a little bit crazy, so here we are.
 The specific thing I'm trying to do is exit insert mode (modal editing, previously evil, currently trying meow) when I arrive back in the main org mode file after editing a src block. I'm not actually sure why I end up in insert mode sometimes when exiting src edit, but it happens often. Advising `org-edit-src-exit` is the place to be for this as far as I can tell, and that works when returning to the main org file.
 The problem I have is that editing a src block without calling `org-edit-special`, thus staying in the main org file, will also trigger the advice. Pressing RET, or using anything that makes a new line in the src block (like `meow-insert-above/below`) will call `org-edit-src-exit` and its advice, and I can't find any way to tell in the context of that advice whether the edit is happening in a special edit buffer or not. I'm guessing that editing src blocks without calling `org-edit-special` happens in a background buffer anyway so the process is indistinguishable?
 I've tried checking the major-mode before exiting the edit buffer, but it's always org-mode. I've tried using `org-in-src-block-p`, `org-src-edit-buffer-p`, checking `org-src-mode`, setting a local variable after `org-edit-special` that I can check in my advice, so many things that haven't worked.
 It's very possible that I'm missing something obvious, or there's a very different solution to my specific problem, but even if so, I'm still curious about how to distinguish these src block editing situations. Anybody have any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I am doing sorting related exercises on CSES and getting stuck at this problem, https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1619/ 
 Here is my code so far
 ``` import Data.List (sort) import Data.Set qualified as S import Data.ByteString.Char8 qualified as B import Data.ByteString (ByteString) import Debug.Trace
 readPair :: ByteString -> (Int, Int) readPair s = let Just (a, s1) = B.readInt s Just (b, _) = B.readInt $ B.tail s1 in (a, b)
 main :: IO () main = do _ <- B.getLine xs <- pure . sort . map readPair . B.lines =<< B.getContents print $ solve xs
 solve :: [(Int, Int)] -> Int solve xs = fst $ foldl step (0, S.empty) xs where step (m, bs) (a', b') = case S.lookupGT a' bs of Nothing -> (max m 1, S.singleton b') Just gt -> let i = S.findIndex gt bs (_, gts) = S.splitAt i bs in (max m (S.size gts + 1), S.insert b' gts) ```
 Without sorting after map readPair, this code takes 0.1s to run the largest test case and passes the time constraint of 1s. With sorting present, it cannot satisfy the time constraint. I tried using Seq instead of List, but the running time was even worst.
 Please help. Thanks.

I went to a line and hit enter and was prompted to put in a comment and to see the menu with `r` when I was done. I made my comment, saved it with `C-c C-c` and then hit `r` and it says to do `c` for comment. But when I hit that I get 
 `Errors: "Unprocessable Entity. User can only have one pending review per pull request"`
 ​
 I'm not entirely sure how to interpret this. There was also an option to send a comment immediately but that seems to be a comment on the PR as a whole which isn't what I want. 
 I guess what I am asking if for people who use this package to give an overview of their workflow on how they might comment on a section of code and any other pointers that they have.

 I've read some of the org and org-roam documentation and as far as I understand it the main benefit of org-roam is easy linking. So I cobbled together a bunch of functions to have an easier linking experience in vanilla org (most probably this already exists and I just didn't find it).
 It lets me select a file from my org directory using fuzzy find, it lets me enter a name (or select from a list of aliases) and another function adds the selection of a specific item as link target.
 So my questions are:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm bad at merging and I'd love to change this.
 For context, I can't wrap my head around "theirs" and "ours" in merge conflict resolution tools. Especially since I'm often the solo dev and responsible for both! Since I vaguely remember all the code, I can't even go by "this looks foreign to me" as a heuristic to orient myself. I sometimes lose track when I rebase feature branches with 20 commits onto another branch a couple of files and commits down the road. It's horrible.
 I usually can't make sense of M-x diff output. I often use smerge and 3-way diffing in git projects, that helps a bit to see things in context, but not always.
 For my stupid brain, this is an accessibility problem
 Here's the solution I have in mind: to tweak how diff tools show both sides so that the versions have more meaningful names.
 Exmaples:
  
Merging foo into main, it'd be nice if the label reads "changes to be applied from foo" and "base from main".
 Rabasing banana onto divergent recipes, with the shared ancestor main, it'd be great if it reads "changes from banana" and "commonality from main" and "difference from main in recipes".
  
If you know a diff viewer, conflict resolution tool, whatever that allows this and how one might approach this, pointers would be appreciated! I can Elisp away myself a bit, but don't know where to start.

 I have some dependencies embedded in them like:
 //> using dep com.lihaoyi::os-lib:0.9.3 //> using dep com.lihaoyi::requests:0.8.0 
 and I'd like to have code completion for these libraries.
 I've tried:
  
IntelliJ IDEA + Scala plugin, it doesn't recognize dependencies. I've created imported in a separate module for the directory that contains my scripts, by using BSP, as it recommends the scala-cli documentation. It works fine for regular SBT projects.
 VisualStudio.code + Metals, code completion doesn't work. I don't have much experiencie with this tool.
  
In addition, with scala-cli, it is easy to experiment with newest Scala versions, before I migrate my SBT project from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3.
 IDEA doesn't realize that my scala script is using Scala 3.3.1 instead of 2.13.
 Which tools do you use for nice editing of scripts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I'm trying to do something in Scala and looking for an advice on why it might be a bad idea or on how to do it better.
 I have a CRUD application with several independent modules, where each one is responsible for one or more resources. Resources are classes such as "Task" or "User" with a specific given and modules are well... just traits:
 ``` trait Module[Name <: String]: def description: String = ???
 trait Resource[M, A]: def description: String = ???
 given Module["todo_list"] = new Module["todo_list"] {} given Resource["todo_list", Task] = Resource.register["todo_list", Task] // checks that "todo_list" is a known module ```
 Using this approach I can write generic functions such as:
  // Check that both module and resource are available to the User canRead[R: Resource](resource: R, by: User): IO[Boolean] 
 ...which is cool. But now I want to find out in runtime what resources are registered for a particular module:
  Module["todo_list"].resources.map(_.description) // a set of descriptions 
 How do I do that? I see two approaches:
  
Having a mutable ListBuffer inside the Module trait and just append instances when Resource.register is called - simple, but mutable
 Attaching every resource explicitly somewhere - logs of boilerplate
  
Could there be a better way?

 This will work but it's sad that foo, bar have to be var, not val.
 My workaround is like this:
 ``` class Clazz { lazy (foo, bar) = initFooBar()
 def init() = { foo bar ... }
 def initFooBar() = { foo = ... bar = ... (foo, bar) } } ```
 But this is awkward. Any better way in scala 2? Or is there any library to leverage?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the premise is I want to adjust a buffer but, then, make sure that the window point is at a certain location within said buffer (so, when switching to that buffer at any point, the cursor is where I'd expect.
 Using with-current-buffer doesn't work as it manipulates the buffer just fine but won't affect the window point (so switching to the buffer has the point in the same location where it last was, regardless of any changes made to the buffer).
 Is there a best practice of how to do this? Is it just making use of switch-to-buffer and switching back, once done with editing said buffer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I'm creating a master document for a course I'm helping to design as the "source of truth" for all subsequent documents (e.g. anki cards, homework assignments, etc.) I would like to be able to compile certain sections to separate files (e.g. the homework separate from the keys, separate from the anki-decks, etc) without putting everything in different files.
 Does anyone know of a way to do this or something similar? I think I could so something similar-ish by using org-transclusion, but it seems to go in the opposite direction (namely, that the separate documents are included into the big org file, but I would still need to edit them and export them from separate files).
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for reading and for any tips in advance!

I'll post an example screenshot; in Linux all of them work, but as you can see some are not visible in this MacOS screenshot. Anyone seen something like this before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I just started out with Emacs because I wanted to use SLIME for Lisp, but I quickly realized how helpful it can be even without knowing most commands and keybindings.
 The fact that I can have something like a web browser integrated in Emacs is extremely helpful for my ADHD because I can just fire up Emacs in the tty, edit my code in one window and have online docs in the other window, and jump between them and copy stuff from the browser to my code, all in a single workflow, and without anything like YouTube distracting me or getting lost in tabs or desktop.
 While with other editors/environments I have to context-switch between at least 3 different workflows (editor, WM/tmux, browser, and usually other stuff like terminals), carefully configure them to not clash, and implement all sorts of nasty hacks to move data between them. And of course getting my thought process cut short is inevitable.
 Emacs makes it so much easier to stay focused on my project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context, I use Gnus for IMAP email (Fastmail). I like it enough, but figured I could give Rmail a try - you know, the endless itch to try things. In my case I am leaning on built-ins and if possibly smaller packages. Which Gnus is not. And Rmail is the "primary email reader". 
 I got the impression this setup could be less straightforward than the "it just works" approach of Gnus, but still. I installed movemail, made a backup copy with offlineimap in case I deleted all my messages by accident :) and then
 (setq rmail-primary-inbox-list '("imaps://my-user%40fastmail.com:the-password@imap.fastmail.com:993")) 
 It worked! Nice!. Except that I have a bunch of aliases (bills@mydomain.com, subscriptions@mydomain.com, etc.) and rules to redirect the messages to sub-directories of Inbox and I don't see a way to get those with movemail.
 I am guessing the config would be one mail file for each one of those directories? But still can't find how to set that up. 
 I might try pointing Rmail to the Maildir back up too, but just like IMAP, it is a one way conversion so I figured I would ask in case I destroy that synced copy for nothing :) 
 Thank you!
 PS: I would try Maildir as describe here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Mailbox-Formats.html

 ​
 but i'm in college so i have to ask,
 will it be helpful if i spent hours learning emacs?
 i used emacs for three days and couldn't change the tab spaces from 8 to 4
 i don't know how elisp works neither do i know what lisp is.
 are there themes in emacs that we can choose from because doom emacs looked really pale when i installed it
 is Emacs future proof?
 currently only highly elite people use emacs, and if we look at statistics the vim users are dominating the number of people using emacs, will emacs have good support in future because i will be sticking to my favourite editor for my entire lifetime i will be bound to it.
 should i learn emacs after my college ends?
 i learnt how to configure and use window managers but i honestly regret using them as my college sem cgpa lowered a lot using it converting to arch linux was a similar choice i love doing both things but they took a lot of time affecting my career if i had time i would absolutely choose learning window managers and using arch linux. will it be the same with emacs??

 I'm currently getting acquainted with Doom Emacs, and I've already experienced the benefits of org roam and local Python development. However, problems start to arise when I try to start developing in Python on a remote host for work. Not only have I not found any eglot configurations specific to working through Tramp, but the installation of pylsp for Python 3.7.3 is also not as smooth as I would like (perhaps it needs to be installed not in the user directory, but in the venv of the project).
 If anyone has any insights, guides, or experience working under these conditions, I am completely open to suggestions. Maybe I am completely wrong when I try to set all this up through Tramp and ssh-deploy, or the installation of a remote instance on the host will work much better.
 Please, help me!

 I've been using org-modern for ages now and I just took it out as it really has some weird issues with certain things (like with tables). So I'm back to straight up org-mode with org-superstar, as well as hiding markdown stuff. That all works great! But, I'm wondering:
 Is there a way to hide #+, < > and [ ]? Specifically:
 Turn #+filename: into filename: at the top and <2024-07-02> or [2024-07-02] into just 2024-07-02? I find them kinda ugly to look at in really nicely presented documents/files.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am setting up a blog (what kind of computer scientist would I be without one!) and I am opting to write it in markdown. I have a shell script that converts these into HTML files using Pandoc (because what kind of Haskell enthusiast would I be if I didn't use Pandoc!).
 I am using the Haskell library to make filters for my Pandoc, and I see I can use multiple instances of --filter but I would rather not and just have my one filter do everything I need. Lets say I wanted to do something to any Inline Str instance that starts with a @ and I also want to act on any Block Codeblock instance that is a $haskell type: ```haskell module Main where
 import qualified Data.Text as T import Text.Pandoc.JSON
 main :: IO () main = do -- toJSONFilter dollarHaskellBlock toJSONFilter linkToBlog return ()
 -- | Lets me act specially on codeblocks labeled '$haskell' dollarHaskellBlock :: Block -> Block dollarHaskellBlock (CodeBlock (identifier, cls:clss, keyValue) codeText) | cls == T.pack "$haskell" = CodeBlock (identifier, T.pack "haskell":clss, keyValue) newCodeText where newCodeText = codeText -- do something here dollarHaskellBlock x = x
 -- | adds a link to any blog with a word in the form @word linkToBlog :: Inline -> Inline linkToBlog (Str strText) | head strString == '@' = linkTo where strString = T.unpack strText linkTo = Link ( T.empty , [] , [] ) [ Underline [ Str (T.tail strText) ] ] ( T.pack ("./" ++ (tail . T.unpack . T.toLower) strText ++ ".html") , T.empty ) linkToBlog x = x ```
 In this case I can use one or the other here and the executable will act as a filter, but I feel like I should be able to do one after the other, but just running both in the do block fails :(.
 Is there a solution here? Thanks. 
 P.S. If you don't know what I am talking about here, IT IS GREAT, and you should totally check out Pandoc and Pandoc FIlters.

 Background: I am looking to get away from GitHub for development. I would like something a little more in line with FOSS/Libre ideals.
 I've been on SourceHut for a while and I really like that there is 0 Javascript—it's fast, reliable, and has worked well so far. Trouble is, collaboration is a little trickier as it's all via mailing lists right now. I've appreciated learning about mailing lists and I have had some people collaborate with me on some software via email—so cool!—but I know this is a blocker for some people. Also, it's technically still in alpha; I know Prot recently left SourceHut due to some missing features, and I kind of look up to Prot's deliberate approach to all things development.
 An alternative I'm considering is Forgejo. (The Codeberg instance, specifically.) They seem to have similar goals in regards to free software and portability, but the workflow is much more PR-based, which is much more comfortable for many users.
 I'm curious to hear people's opinions on the two forges: where do you like developing software? (Especially Emacs related software.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks!
 I was wondering if anyone knows the current state of macro annotations in Scala 3 LTS:
 It all started a long time ago; I was intrigued by the new style of defining newtypes that libraries like Iron introduced in place of the typical @newtype annotation of the popular Scala 2 library, then I asked "why so much more boilerplate to create a value class?".
 Then I saw that more metaprogramming and macro-based libraries stopped using annotations in Scala 3 as well, and wondered if maybe it was just a change in style in general.
 So my question is, is it no longer possible to create macro annotations? If so, what is the reason for this? Compile time annotations like @tailrec or @depreciation still work, and I also saw that a MacroAnnotation class was introduced under an experimental flag in Scala 3.3.0, but I'm not sure what is left to accomplish so that it could be merged into the latest Scala version.
 I appreciate any clarification on this topic! Happy coding 😄.

I use skeleton-mode for my own projects, but setting that up requires using its mini-language, so not easy to do with dir-locals. Is there a package I could use for this? Perhaps some way to use yasnippets?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When opening a binary file, I want to show the metadata obtained from some shell commands, instead of the real content of that file. For example, I want to do emacs binary.h5, but instead of showing the binary code, I want to show the result from h5ls binary.h5. 
 Of course I can use some hook to run the function I like, but the problem is that emacs would load the content of the file at some point, and I want to avoid this, because the size of the binary file can be huge.
 I think one way to solve this problem is to define my own functions in shell/emacs, and only use those functions to open the file. But I'm curious if there is a way to avoid emacs to load certain files. 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I've been using Emacs for a couple months now as my primary editor and a little longer before for just Lisp-related stuff. I have my config (~500 LOC) I'm pretty comfortable with but it's far from perfect. It's a little messy, not everything works as expected. Like I still don't know how to set custom font for Emacs client or solaire mode doesn't work for some reason despite using themes that support it, not a big deal but it'd be nice to make them work. Now I'm thinking whether is it better to polish my current config so I have everything set up exactly how I want or to use some distribution that makes it all easier. I know it's pretty much matter of preferences, but it's hard to make a decision by myself not knowing what I miss from Doom/Spacemacs nor what trade-offs there are + I already have somehow functional config and I don't know if at this point making a switch is a right move.
 And, despite I'm ex hardcore Vim user I don't use evil-mode in Emacs (I mostly do program in Lisp languages in which Vim keybinding is just useless thanks to structural editing and paredit), but I know both of these distribution use evil-mode by default. So what is their support for Emacs keybinding?

If I just embed the LaTeX with no begin/end then I can't edit it using org-edit-special : if I do put it in a begin_export or begin_src I can edit it as LaTex but I can't preview it. Am I missing something? Is there a way to preview inside block delimiters that I am missing? Very new to LaTeX inside org so probably overlooked something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm interested in having an automated way of getting cabal's interface files (either a copy/symlink to them or redirecting the output). Unfortunately the closest thing to getting a directory is `cabal list-bin` which seems fragile for this (would require some string manipulation/isn't guaranteed). 
 I would prefer against setting `-hidir` if possible as some programs (cabal/ghc-pkg) assume that the location is not changed (though I do have workarounds for this case). Notably setting `-hidir` causes build failures with cabal unless you do a build without the flag first... 
 If anyone has any ideas here I would greatly appreciate it.

 If an instance doesn't satisfy the laws, that can cause all sorts of problems. But how big of an issue is this, empirically speaking? I'm looking for examples of real-world bugs in typeclass instances. I'd like to get a sense of things like:
 - How common are these bugs?
 - How are unlawful typeclass instances discovered? E.g., are they found via property testing, or by tracking down the issue from some other bug? Are they found by maintainers of the package or other users?
 - Are there typeclasses whose laws seem particularly prone to bugs?

 Got me to think, are there any alternative, and perhaps superior, ways to start long running processes like this? Obviously opening a shell is an option but I've been tending to avoiding doing that where possible.

address in a future post, and the ever-present RAG.
RAG, short for Retrieval Augmented Generation, has garnered a lot of attention
in the GenAI community and for good reasons. You “simply” hook the LLM up to your
documents (more on that later), and it can suddenly tackle any question, as

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note, I still have a lot to learn.
 One thing that I find valuable in programming is abstracting the implementation. For example, we can have a module A that defines a certain function type, that is actually implemented in a separate module.
 For the purpose of learning, I made a simple example of the StopWatch implementation: https://github.com/igr/exemplatory/tree/main/stopwatch/haskell-mtl
 My goal is to have Stopwatch module that is NOT aware of the implementation of the function that returns (IO) current time. Of course, I am using current time just for the sake of the example; it can be any other function that the module does not need to know about.
 I know that Haskell allows that, but would warn about orphan instances. For that purpose, I followed the GHC compiler advice and used the wrapped type; although I liked the code better with orphan instance.
 I wonder—what would be the better way to implement such StopWatch? I could make everything simpler and have a function that just accepts the timestamp instead of a function that generates one; but would I encapsulate the stopwatch business capabilities in a correct way?

 haskell -- TODO: There must be a way to return a pair of Proxies. This is *really close* to full dependent types -- though. These proxies should be tagged with proofs that their Nat is less than i, which is something -- we *do* know at compile-time, but the problem is that we can't know what these values are until runtime. -- So while the only information we have about these type level numbers is that they are less than i (which -- is a compile-time fact), we don't know what they are exactly until runtime. closestInternalNodes :: forall n m i mostprev mostnext.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm currently facing an issue with configuring Emacs on WSL to open Excel files using the Windows Excel program. I've tried the following configuration, inspired by the awesome Bozhidar's blog post on setting the default browser[1] by:
  (when (and (eq system-type 'gnu/linux) (getenv "WSLENV")) ;; Configure opening Excel files from WSL (setq org-file-apps '(("\\.xlsx\\'" . "cmd.exe /c start excel \"%s\"")))) 
 Then in Org file in the same directory as xlsx file I have following link:
  [[file:test.xlsx][test]] 
 finally I run org-open-at-point (C-c C-o) being with the point over the link.
 While Excel opens successfully, the specified file doesn't get passed as an argument to the Excel command. I'm wondering if there's a correct way to pass the file path as the last argument in the command. Has anyone encountered a similar issue or can provide insights on how to resolve it?
 Also I tested from the terminal of the WSL distro the command itself
  cmd.exe /c start excel test.xlsx 
 And it works properly.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ekg is a note taking package that is tag-based, and uses sqlite for storage. The new version 0.5.0 is out, featuring the following major changes:
  
Inline tags! Now you can just add tags as you type, which I find very convenient. The tags are, in org-mode, turned into org-mode links, so those who like this style of having links in one note that enable "backlinks" will find this more familiar. The backlinks here are just the tag showing the notes that have the link to that tag.
 
ekg-auto-save, a module by Qingshui Zheng that let's you enable saving notes automatically as you write them, which works in a similar way to the emacs auto-save functionality. If you write longer notes, this should be useful.
 
Improvements to org-mode notes. Because of the way our notes buffer works, it has metadata at the top which has read-only elements that interfere with org-mode. We now have some ability to narrow the buffer before the appropriate org-mode commands so that they work correctly. But this solution isn't perfect, and more work needs to be done. 
 
Trash simplification - I previously had the notion that trashing a note should trash the individual tags, prepending them all with "trash/". That idea never really panned out, and was adding too much complication, so now there's just a "trash" tag. If your note has that tag, it's in the trash.
 
Aborting a note. If you are capturing a note, save it as a draft, but then want to just abandon both the note and the draft, you can do that with C-c C-k. Also thanks to Qingshui Zheng!
 
Many bug fixes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to have the the option to call magit-status as the first thing I do when opening a project. Project.el allows to define this kind of behavior using projects-switch-commands and, in fact magit does that once magit-project-statusis called.
 I'm not able to make this work the way I want without resorting to the following: explicitly requiring project.el, and copy/pasting the code from magit-extras that sets the magit command to so:
 ``` (require 'project)
 ;; Git management (use-package magit)
 ;; Copied from magit/magit-extras.el (when (and (boundp 'project-prefix-map) ;; Only modify if it hasn't already been modified. (equal project-switch-commands (eval (car (get 'project-switch-commands 'standard-value)) t))) (keymap-set project-prefix-map "m" #'magit-project-status) (add-to-list 'project-switch-commands '(magit-project-status "Magit") t)) ```
 There must be a way to do this without the need of repeating code, but I failed to make other approaches work.
 Any help is welcomed.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Intro: I'm new to OrgMode. Currently using Workflowy. 
 I currently use a daily template with a predefined series of tasks on top of which I add new ones.
 Separately I have a weekly template for the training routine. I usually "instantiate" this template at the beginning of the week and then on specific days I refer to items from it.
 Questions:
  
I have read about Capture templates. Are these the mechanism I should use to define templates?
 How can I link/refer to a task somewhere in the tree from another subtree?
  
with gratitude,
 Alex

 The description of the problem is below. My solution for anyone who faced with such an issue: 1. Emacs has amazing tool M-x describe-variable 2. M-x describe-variable RET lsp-diagnostics-provider RET should open a window with explanation of this variable and current value 3. To resolve the problem the value should be "flycheck", here is details what is it https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/settings/diagnostics/#lsp-diagnostics-provider 4. And here is about flycheck https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/index.html 5. You can set the value programmatically or with Emacs UI 6. Enjoy your errors!)
 But still, I get separate window on hover, even with (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show nil)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use Emacs (doom, 29.1) via the daemon in MacOS (14.3, apple M2). I used to have the emacs-plus installed, but switched to emacs-macport. The first one seemed to have a homebrew service installed for the daemon, but it never worked for me, not sure why. I'm now trying to set up the daemon for emacs-macport.
 What I've gathered so far:
 - Opening emacs GUI and doing m-x start-server make the process be attached to that OS Window and, when it is closed, it all dies together.
 - running /opt/homebrew/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --daemon gives me the terminal output I would expect when starting the daemon and a process, but when I try to emacsclient -cn, it opens a terminal emacs, not a GUI.
 Daemon start command output:
 Starting Doom Emacs in daemon mode! Initializing org-roam database... Clearing removed files... Clearing removed files...done Processing modified files... Processing modified files...done Copilot agent started. Starting Emacs daemon. Doom loaded 285 packages across 47 modules in 5.113s 
 - when using the launchctl, as indicated in the wiki (with the modifications to emacs' path, and --fg-daemon), it starts the process with the same output as above. But, when trying to emacsclient -cn it gives me *ERROR*: Terminal type xterm-kitty is not defined. Doing export TERM=xterm does fix that, but it still opens a (rather very bugged) terminal frame.
 - Lastly, I tried creating an Emacs.app via Automator, but when invoked, it gives me the error could not get terminal name, which, I suppose, comes from the fact it is trying to open in a terminal, not GUI.
 TL;DR: It seems I've managed to open the server, but not to open a GUI frame. Any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using awesome-tray and like the layout a lot. It does have some problems though, for instance there are errors on startup and I'm not able to set the color successfully. I'm wondering if anyone has experience with these type of packages?
 Another one that works well is mini-echo which is free of errors, but the code is structured in an advanced lisp style that's hard for me to interpret, so I have not been able to customize it for different reasons.
 It would be good to fix the errors in awesome-tray and improve it. The errors I get are fairly simple:
 awesome-tray.el: Warning: Pattern t is deprecated. Use _ instead [2 times]
 Warning: setting attribute ‘:background’ of face ‘mode-line-buffer-id’: nil value is invalid, use ‘unspecified’ instead.
 Warning: setting attribute ‘:foreground’ of face ‘region’: nil value is invalid, use ‘unspecified’ instead.Unable to load color "color" [2 times]
 I've been able to override how awesome-tray displays major modes with a list of shorthand strings and change the time format, so it seems easy to customize. I suspect setq awesome-tray-mode-line-active-color doesn't work because of the above errors, but I'm not certain.
 Anyway are there any other packages that would be a good choice, or does anyone have some advice on how I might go about fixing or improving awesome-tray? My lisp knowledge on it's own is not enough to locate the problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What kinds of buffers do you wish you could bookmark in Emacs that you can't usefully bookmark already? Emacs can of course bookmark specific locations in regular text files, but also several types of non-file buffers: dired, eshell, Man, eww, Info, help, image, vc-dir, doc-view, possibly others. Are there any others you'd like to be able to bookmark?
 Here are some ideas:
  
occur and grep buffers (jumping to the bookmark would rerun the search).
 
REPLs. I can imagine this being useful: you bookmark a Python REPL and later jumping to the bookmark starts a new REPL and reruns all the import statements you had run before (or maybe just reruns everything?, or everything marked with a special comment?)
 
shells. The eshell bookmarks are great, and that's what I use, but not everyone uses eshell. A shell bookmarker should preserve the current directory and whether you were ssh'ed into some other computer.
 
Shell command output buffers, the bookmarks should rerun the command. Same for compilation buffers (revert-buffer already knows how to rerun the compilation!).
 
 I'd love to see some more ideas for missing bookmark capabilities.

 I'm trying to find a good, generic, folding solution based on indentation level. This is just because I tend to have formatting outputs that don't have specific configuration for hs-minor-mode. hs-minor-mode seems like a good solution in general, but looks like it doesn't come with an obvious indentation-based level solution?
 I have used yafolding but in general I have found that I can't get yafolding-toggle-all to do something predictable. What it chooses to fold is never predictable to me.
 Any solution using hs-minor-mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is the _ALL suffix not allowed for Special Properties?
 I've been trying to restrict the values that can be given to the CATEGORY property. Now I know that for a property I define -- MYPROP, say -- I can specify a set of allowed values by giving them as a list to the property MYPROP_ALL for example:
 #+PROPERTY: MYPROP_ALL Value1 Value2 Value3 
 Then if I use ‘C-c C-x p’ (‘org-set-property’) and answer "MYPROP" to its first prompt, the second prompt (which wants the value) forces me to stick to the list in MYPROP_ALL.[1] Also, both ‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-property-next-allowed-value’) and ‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-property-previous-allowed-value’ respect the MYPTOP_ALL list as well.
 But when it comes to Special Properties that doesn't appear to work. So if I have:
 #+PROPERTY: CATEGORY_ALL Value1 Value2 Value3 
 then ‘C-c C-x p’ (‘org-set-property’) ignores the list in CATEGORY_ALL.[1] Furthermore, neither ‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-property-next-allowed-value’) nor ‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-property-previous-allowed-value’ pay attention to it either. In fact both of them respond with "Allowed values for this property have not been defined".
 Is that the expected behavior, or am I doing something wrong?
 [1] Org may well give a completion list, but only if CATEGORY has already been given values elsewhere in the file, and then the list consists of all those values, and it still ignores CATEGORY_ALL. And that list of pre-used values is not enforced, the way an _ALL list is. It is merely a list of suggestions that can be ignored; brand new values can be entered without being trapped.

The implementation was pretty straightforward, but I had to make sure that the log file is not accessed concurrently by multiple fibers. I could have used a Ref to keep track of the state, but I came across Semaphore in ZIO and decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to use. 
 This is my new blog post about how to use Semaphore to implement concurrency control in ZIO.

I've also seen an example of someone running two VScodes, one for the project and the other for the test project, and notepad++ for editing config files.
 Does anyone find it weirder that no one seems to think this is a weird thing to do?

 I'm reading a string from console:
 add vet james bond espionage <command> <context> <command specific arguments> 
 My ADTs looked like this:
 object Context: case object Vet extends Context case object Owner extends Context trait Command trait ContextedCommand[T <: Context] extends Command { val arguments: List[String] } case class Add[T <: Context](context: T, arguments: List[String]) extends ... more commands 
 My flow is: read string from console -> validate command & context -> validate arguments depending on context and command (pattern matching) -> execute specific "Repository" method depending on command + context (pattern matching) .
 What refactoring should I do, if I'm trying to go to the tagless final approach?
 Currently I'm going in circles fiddling with the code from the command and implementing something that seems wrong and scrapping it.
 Would the correct refactoring steps be:
  
remove context: T from Command proprties
 validate command & context the same way 
 create separate given instances for validators addVetValidator() / addOwnerValidator()
 continue with distinct given instances for command handling logic 
  
I've watched RockTheJvm's video/article and DevInsideYou's series but I feel like I'm too grug brained.

 At first, I'm reading https://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf to understand "Free monad". I mean the word FFree in title is from this paper.
 And maybe I have been able to understand what is FFree in this paper. This paper says FFree is a data type which has two aspects Pure and Impure, especially Impure works as an action handler like monad's >>= and it presents fmap. I think that FFree seems very simple and reasonable.
 So I implemented FFree monad as written in the paper. ```haskell {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} import Control.Monad ((>=>)) data FFree f a where Pure :: a -> FFree f a Impure :: f x -> (x -> FFree f a) -> FFree f a
 instance Monad (FFree f) where Impure fx k' >>= k = Impure fx (k' >=> k) Pure a >>= k = k a ```
 And I need Functor and Applicative for Monad instance.
 ```haskell instance Functor (FFree f) where fmap f (Pure a) = Pure (f a) -- Continuous is here, impressible. fmap f (Impure fx k) = Impure fx (fmap f . k)
 instance Applicative (FFree f) where pure = Pure Pure f <> Pure a = Pure (f a) Pure f <> Impure fx k = Impure fx (fmap f . k) Impure fx f <> p@(Pure _) = Impure fx (\x -> f x <> p) -- I have no idea how implement this pattern. Impure fx f <> Impure gx g = undefined `` I could writeFunctorwith no problem (maybe), but I couldn't write<>implementation betweenImpurecase. Here is my question again, how do I implementFFree` of Applicative?
 From the first, What does Applicative applying between Impure mean theoretically?
 P.S. No need to ensure what a compiler says, I know why I can't it. Left hand f x and right hand one are rigid types each other.

 TLDR: With the confusing advice on how to setup a new typescript dev setup. I have wasted a long time until I realized, I had updated the typescript tree-sitter grammar to one that wasn't compatible with emacs 29.2 on fedora. Reverting to an older version fixed it. See fix below.
 So I am just starting programming in typescript for work. Up until now I have been focused on Python.

 I was dismayed that I could not get realtime word-count in N++ and also dismayed at the author of N++ in how he responded.
 So here I am back to Emacs 5 years later.
 A few questions
 the sidebar has a section called "configurations" (plural) yet only lists Better-Defaults for setting up emacs. my own configuration settings were based on technomancy's Emacs Starter Kit. What other frameworks for managing defaults are out there?
 What is the best Emacs package archive these days? my setup references MELPA and ELPA.
 it seems something called "Embark" is replacing helm? Currently my attempt to load emacs from init.el choked on trying to call init-helm:

The definitive fix would involve refining the logic within org-roam-db-sync, but until then, a workaround is to set the path to its true location or use the file-truename function as shown below:
 elisp (setq org-directory (file-truename "~/Notebooks/") org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/Notebooks/RoamNotes/") ) 
 Discovering the Issue:

 I.e. operate on Level 1b to produce (with all the heading contents intact):

 In the world of lispy/paredit, this would be barfing from Level 1, slurping to the beginning of Level 2. 
 The only thing I can figure is to promote Level 1b by a level, move point down to Level 2, move Level 2 up above Level 1b, return to Level 1b, demote it a level.

 ```
 type X = A | B | C

 Is it possible to make a type which represents the concept of "any of this type except these types"? 
 I have the following data types.
 ```
 trait Base {}
 trait Special extends Base {}
 trait A extends Special {}
 trait B extends Special {}
 trait C extends Base {}
 trait D extends Base {}
 ```
 I am looking for something like `type Y = Base - Special`. Today, I could write that as `type Y = C | D`. However, next week, someone might create `trait E extends Base`, at which point that definition of `Y` becomes out of date. At the location where one would logically create `E`, it is not at all obvious that you would need to update `Y`. 
 Is something like this supported in the compiler? I didn't find it in the documentation, but then I couldn't even find the documentation for `|`, so I obviously did not find a potentially relevant part of the documentation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To support both Latin and Chinese text, I have the following in my Emacs config:
  (use-package faces :config (set-face-attribute 'default t :family "DejaVu Sans Mono" :foundry "PfEd" :slant 'normal :weight 'normal :height 190 :width 'normal) (setq default-frame-alist '((font . "DejaVu Sans Mono-16"))) :custom (face-font-family-alternatives '(("hans" "adobe-source-han-sans-cn-font")))) 
 I especially like DejaVu for programming (easy to distinguish 0, O, 1, l). However, I've run into an issue with the corfu pop-up, where things aren't rendered correctly, since my Chinese font is taller than Deja Vu:
 https://github.com/minad/corfu/issues/420#event-11611884483
 Is there a way for me to set the height of alternative fonts?
 Alternatively, can anyone recommend a monospace font that I could use for both Latin and Chinese text?

 There is already some interesting development, such as switching to the tabs, instead of frames, in order to improve the multi-monitor management:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I dunno if anyone else has run into this but I have a buffer; let's say 9 lines. And I have a function which runs (previous-line) (beginning-of-line 1) and said function is bound to a key (let's say <up>).
 So I apply a text-property of 'invisible using (pos-bol) of the first line and (1+ (pos-eol)) in order to get the first line to disappear, like it's not even there.
 If I'm on line 3 and M-: my function, it does what I'd expect and (point) will return the (pos-bol) of the second line. But, if I execute my function by pressing <up> from line 3, (point) keeps returning back 1, the point of the beginning of line 1 rather than the point at the beginning of line 2.
 Is this expected behavior? I'd be less weirded out if running code through M-: gave back similar results but I get what I'd expect to happen no matter what code I run and only the unexpected behavior when running the exact same code via a key binding.
 This seems to happen even when running Emacs with -Q. Also occurs when I try with (backward-char) and C-b: so long as it's the first line – at the top of the buffer – which is invisible, there's a difference between executing code by itself vs. via key commands (with the latter putting me at point 1, every time).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at the docs for tree-sitter. I think I'm pretty sold on trying it out for c++ programming, as there's a lot of utility in smarter highlighting (and easy customization of the grammar). 
 However, I have a question (of course): 
 The only examples I could find of custom highlighting was assigning custom faces to different syntactic elements.
 But I need not to just be able to change the font but also display properties so that I can provide substitutions (unicode symbols for example), the 'raise property for superscripts, :align-to to keep my end of line comments lined up since I use proportional fonts, and more. 
 Can it do that? 
 I suppose I could combine other highlighting packages to get this functionality, but the thing I was hoping to get out of tree-sitter was better accuracy in my substitution operators as well, using syntax queries instead of regexs.

 I have been using doom emacs for a while now. But this video kind of blew my mind

 But sadly i could not find the emacs config file to bootstrap. Does anyone has a similar config which they can share.

 TIA

 So I had my old dog of a laptop die on me the other day and had to run out and buy a new one. Settled on an M2 Air since I mostly do writing, documents and some analysis and the version is Sonoma 14.3. I live in Emacs, I do all my writing with it and basically feel like I can't live without it. I have been running Railwaycats emacsport for, I dunno eight years or so..? Installed via Homebrew, which I don't really have much experience with since it always just worked whenever I've used it. But this time with this new computer I really can't seem to figure out how to get it done nor what I dare to do. Has anyone else been through this? If so how did you do it? Should I just try with "--cask" even though my OS isn't listed?
 If you don't know what I'm talking about, this is the repo: https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport
 I am confused and looking for some guidance here. I was hoping one of you pros had some.
 Thanks!

 I want to remotely connect to an instance of SSH running on a remote OSX machine (to save files I forgot to save).
 So I run (in the terminal)
  emacsclient -t 
 Then I get (momentarily) emacs to display a buffer in this terminal. But in around 3 seconds, it quits and I am back into the command line.
 This problem happens even if I am running emacsclient inside Terminal in front of the computer running emacs (no ssh involved).
 I can do it over and over again, and I am always getting the same result. I have checked and this is a problem I also have locally.
 I have checked that I run the emacsclient that corresponds with my emacs installation (Emacs-29.1, in /Applications/Emacs.app/
 Does anybody have any idea what is going on?
 thank you in advance,

I wanted to see if I could work on the assignment in Doom emacs, and quickrun seemed like the easiest solution to having the same functionality as the run button in vscode instead of manually compiling every class in a project. I tried executing quickrun on the main class but it seems like it's not recognizing the other class in the package.

 Are there any additional steps to setting up quickrun correctly?

This process not only presented some technical challenges but also involved a substantial amount of work. There are many usage scenarios to support, and the testing alone took nearly two weeks.
 With this, Metanote's support for the core features of Org mode is more comprehensive, including basic document structure, custom task management, custom InBufferSettings like tags, Agenda views, custom Capture, and more. I believe Metanote is now one of the most complete applications supporting Org mode outside of Emacs. In future development, we will gradually introduce support for rich text rendering, including images, tables, hyperlinks, encryption, export functions, Roam Research, and more. Stay tuned.

I wonder if it would help new users learn about monads if we said "a Monad is something that has a do notation, and you have to write >>= to explain what its do notation means".
 Personally I find (m >>= g) >>= h == m >>= (\x -> g x >>= h) really obscure and (f >=> g) >=> h == f >=> (g >=> h) really cool, but not relevant to practice, but I find
 do y <- do x <- m f x g y == do x <- m y <- f x g y 
 really practical and straightforward. What do you think?

 Long-time Emacs user (this is my 8th year!) and lurker on this sub. I use Emacs for *nearly* everything. Coding, reading, writing, RSS, ToDos, knowledge base, website, music etc.
 So, I'm juggling Emacs on a bunch of different setups: a Linux machine with Ubuntu at home, a RHEL workstation and a node I ssh into at work, a MacOS laptop, a few Raspberry Pis. You see where this is going. Each has different uses, but some core things that I like to keep consistent.
 With the mix of OSX, Ubuntu, RHEL, plus the GUI and TTY variations, I need to change my Emacs config on every machine (even though a lot stays the same across the board).
 The real headache starts when I change something on one machine, and I want to apply that to all (or some) of the other machines. Yak shaving and all...
 Right now, my setup's built around an init.el that loads up a settings.org file, which has my literate config. The way I deal with some things (for example, remapping key bindings on MacOS) is by wrapping it up with conditionals. But it's looking quite ugly and is more annoying to maintain.
 I wonder what the best approach here is. Split my config into multiple files and load them as needed depending on where I am? Maybe mess around with Git branches for different setups? (And how would I even start with that?) Git submodules?
 Are there some tools that already deal with this? I am sure this is not an Emacs-only problem.
 Thanks in advance and would love to hear how you deal with this :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am building a small compiler in Haskell and I just finished the syntax analysis phase. During syntax analysis, it was easy to keep track of the line and column numbers where the parsing failed and report back what was expected and what the compiler needed. 
 But if the parsing succeeds, the generated AST is passed on to check the semantics. However, my AST nodes do not store any positional (or spanning) information. So if I find a semantic error, I can only tell what the error is but cannot provide any line or column number information.
 The easiest way to solve this is to store the spanning information on most nodes I have defined, which is tedious and lengthy. Additionally, I would have to write boilerplate code on parsing functions. 
 Is there any other method you'd recommend for this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a rather vague idea that is still forming:
 Could a SoC project be proposed to train or fine-tune a LLM on Scala code?
 Most LLMs are primarily trained on Python code, just because there is so much of it, leading to more generated Python code, ...
 For Scala there is less code to train on, on the other hand models like Phi-2 show that a smaller set of highly curated training data (in this case well-written code) can make even smaller models compete with bigger ones trained on "the internet".
 A fork of e.g. CodeLlama 70B, fine-tuned with the full Git history of successful Scala projects might decrease the gap between code generation capabilities for Python and Scala.
 The aider project proposes a diff format that is more amenable to LLM generation than the standard Git diff. The transformation from one to the other should be rather mechanical and a well-written Git commit is a very close to an instruction a human might give an LLM in order to get a code modification done, so hopefully one could get a sufficient amount of decent training data from existing open source Scala repos. 
 I created a GitHub issue on the ScalaCenter Google Summer of Code repo as well, but Reddit might be a better place for brainstorming and discussion.
 Feel free to post any ideas, critique, proposals related to the topic here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes the rows and their column widths in org tables can get too wide and that makes navigating the columns awkward.
 At that stage it may become easier to copy out the row being edited and the headers to a new table, transpose it and edit vertically, transpose it back again and insert it into its original position without the headers.
 This is rather like the form mode in spreadsheets which enable a wide column to be viewed without navigating horizontally.
 The problem is the formulas get messed up in the process.
 Is there some fix out there for this issue.

 I've been enjoying using Clangd LSP features inside docker-tramp, but I wanted to ask if anyone ever tried debugging a binary built inside that container? I tried to dumbly debug the binary using a launch.json, but unsurprisingly got:
  Could not start debugger process, does the program exist in filesystem? Error: spawn gdb ENOENT 
 Obviously gdb and other tools are on the container, it's just likely that the path used (/docker:<container-id>:/path/to/binary) doesn't exist in dap's eyes. Anyone thought about or have some sort of workaround for this?

 I can review pull requests, easily add comments and of course pull all the changes from that PR to my local Git repository. For me, the best part is however just opening the right repo in the web browser. That way I can easily see CI pipeline status in seconds.
 Setting up a Magit forge is little bit of work. But it really pays off. Totally recommend.
 By the way, I noticed that in Github Magit has 427 supporters and in LiberaPay 130. I like round numbers a lot more. How about 450 and 140?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was wondering if there was a way to copy a date from a capture source in org-capture to use as the value for :time-prompt so that I don't have to type it in every time. I do not want it to insert today's date, I have fixed dates that I want to add to a datetree. I want it to keep the timestamp and file it and its header in the correct place in the date tree (unless that's redundant... I'm not sure).
 So what I've been trying to move (technically I want this to occur every two weeks but just starting small to test it):
 ** Recycling
 <2024-01-30 Tue>
 I can only get it to work through setting :time-prompt to t and typing the date in manually. But this is tedious
 Managed to thoroughly confuse myself so I'm giving up and asking. If I'm not going about this a sensible way feel free to tell me also. Thank you.
 edit: I should say I have read the documentation multiple times. I may have missed something though. I have also tried to google my problem but I struggled to find anything fully relevant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently learning to use emacs and org/org-roam. So far it doesn't seem too complicated and I could implement a note taking system that would work for me. But I barely scratched the surface and wonder if I could make my current workflow (coming from Obsidian) work.
 So what I currently do is to mostly take daily notes in which I have a template that covers the following:
  
What did I do (just a bunch of bullet points)
 Ideas 
 Each idea is a bulletpoint
 Each idea has some metadata like "subject:: homelab"
 
 Daily journal (some bulletpoints)
 Tasks 
 New Tasks, that I want to get done (tasks usually have metadata to categorize them)
 A list of all tasks I finished today
 
  
Then I have a couple of notes that display this information in a grouped way. For example I have a tasks note that displays all my open tasks. And I have a homelab note, that lists all ideas and tasks with the metadata "subject:: homelab" under headings for ideas and tasks. Also the list of completed tasks in the daily note is auto populated with tasks that have the completed date set to today.
 Now I'm trying to do something similar with org-roam. 
 TL;DR: I want to query my org-roam notes for specific data that is marked with metadata and display it in other notes
 Thank you!

 My question is simple: can I add the import after I've already written the code? Say I copy&paste from a website and need to add imports? PyCharm has Ctrl+Return for that as a shortcut.

 I have created WikiMusic, an invite-only community, with a well spirited effort to share musical knowledge with the world. This means tabs and PDFs for several instruments for music of all kind.
 The backend for WikiMusic is made with Haskell, using Servant, Free monads (freer-simple), Hasql and more.
 I am more of a backend dev type of person, but dabble in frontend every now and then. The frontend works with Svelte, Tailwind, Skeleton. The platform works with Haskell (.nix), Nix, PostgreSQL and others.
 I'd love to hear your experiences with the page, and with the UX, the Haskell code, and look forward to feedback you may have. If you want to become a member of WikiMusic feel free to email me at [jjbigorra@gmail.com](mailto:jjbigorra@gmail.com)

This works well, except when it comes to lsp integration. Sometimes the "global" server that is installed via lsp via the prompt won't play nice when I switch language versions and simply crashes over and over for every file I open.
 Any suggestions on how I can set my config to check for an lsp server installed in the project dir? In fact, it would be very useful if emacs only used/installed in the project dir and never used/installed servers to the emacs directory.

My main workflow is to make a series of changes in a git project and then diff them against the checked in versions before doing a commit as a last check. ediff-revision works for single files although quitting is sometimes a bit odd. 
 But ediff-directory-revision doesn't seem to do what I want.
  
It only seems to operate on a directory and not recursively below it. 
 All the files popup in the registry rather than just the ones that have changed.
  
Is there some way to get the behavior I want. (A tree view of the fileset would be a nicety)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I am Haskell newbie and I am little bit confused about "built-in" types concept in Haskell. Coming from C++ background, I understand "built-in" as constructs recognizable by compiler without including external libraries. In Haskell however I see in many literature sources, types like Int|Num| Bool, are treated as "built-in", or core language features, though they can be easily "excluded", by disabling Prelude module, which in my understanding is just external "library" included by default. To add to confusion, some core language constructs, like guards will not even work without including Prelude. On other hand constructs like 
 import Prelude() 
 foo x = 1
 compiles well, but then what is the "1" type in this case (Isn't Num defined by including Prelude)?
 So I guess the question is - Where true (in C++ sense) bult-in language features can be found if at all. And should Prelude be understood as true external library or as "grey area" combining both traits of external library and compiler intrinsic syntax.

 I'm currently starting to learn and develop with Haskell. While I developed with Haskell I really started to like the idea to express errors in types and make them explicit so that you have to handle them. Now I started to develop a small app with Flutter and Dart and i was really surprised that Dart more or less just provides unchecked exceptions by default. Because I thought Dart is a relative young language I was wondering, why one would decide to design the language this way. Is there a real benefit?
 The question is not directly to Haskell related, but I thought there are many smart people here and maybe someone could explain it to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love the Agenda time grid but when I have large gaps in it due to a variety of tasks that will take a few hours each it would be nice to show this visually. I know I can do a two active schedule dates with some dashes to get it to show a span of time i.e. <date>--<date> . 
 However I'd prefer if I could do some prefix / augmentation to the agenda like below. Imagine the prep of salads would take 2.5 hours and is marked with 2.5 hrs of effort. 
  Task: 18:30...... Scheduled: NEXT Prep Salads for Wed/Thurs/Fri |-> 19:00...... |-> 20:00...... |-> 21:00...... Reminder: 21:30...... Start Evening Wind Down Habit: 22:00...... Scheduled: NEXT Evening Review 
 I know a some lisp and want to learn more...but org and agenda are quite big code bases to jump into fresh. Figured I'd ask here before I start down this road of trying to make the feature. 
 Full solutions or even just some food for thought or starting points of what to look into would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started learning Haskell today and am using GHCi interactive terminal. 
 Since Haskell is lazy strongly typed language , it shouldn't even try to evalute different types. So I checked types of two different entities. ( Are they objects as in C++ or python, or are they something else , I don't know what the runtime model of Haskell is ? )
 ghci> :t "abc"
 "abc" :: String
 ghci> :t ['a','b','c']
 ['a','b','c'] :: [Char]
 Okay, so list of Char is different from String. So they shouldn't evalute when checked for equality. Since [Char] and String are clearly different types, why following is evaluted? 
 ghci> "abc" == ['a','b','c']
 True

 It looks like each emacsclient needs to set fallback font individually. Any idea how to make it work also in that case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I've got the problem that "turning back in time" is not possible from org roam dailies.
 I can use org-roam-dailies-goto-yesterday without a problem but as soon as I want to go back e.g. 3 days, day per day org-roam-dailies-goto-previous-node is very convenient.
 I am in the today's daily file and try to use this function but the message I get is "Not in a daily-note". The behavior is the same for org-roam-dailies-goto-next-node or org-roam-dailies-find-next-node (and so on).
 It seems like (org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p) is nil if I excute it as lisp function in todays org-roam-daily buffer/file.
 I have no clue how I can resolve this.
 Anyone having the same problems or any ideas?

 edit - I use doom by the way
 I'm a org +roam2 user, but I find myself doing more and more "coding" these days.
 I always intend to use emacs / magit etc for code projects, but find myself getting bewidered and end up using something else.
 As a non-dev I'm unfamiliar with the terms used in emacs-world.
 My experiences so far:
 1 Previously I've managed to tramp in to my headless Pi from emacs to edit my Home Assistant .yaml file - but have even stopped doing that because of the loooooong command I need to type (I have never worked out how to paste it - or do some lisp magic) to make it work. 
 2 I looked into Python (Anki Vector SDK) but ended up confused and went back to nano / Mu (via Windows);
 3 I also looked into Arduino (c++) but ended up confused about interfacing with the microcontroller itself, so went back to Arduino IDE (Windows);
 4 I had a platformIO project (Gaggiauino - STM32 Blackpill). I couldn't fathom platformIO in emacs, fell back on VSCode on linux (which threw a bunch of errors) and ended up using VSCode in Windows.
 I may be wrong, but I feel if I can start just one project in emacs (probably editing something on a remote machine) then everything will click?
 Any tips on where to begin?

My whole life passes by, by just configuring Emacs. What is the meaning of life?
  
Why do you say what is the meaning of life?
  
Emacs is the main source of problems in my life.
  
Emacs? Hah! I would appreciate it if you would continue.
  
Well, it has many bugs I want to fix.
  
What makes you believe you might want to fix?
  
I can't live with bugs existing in Emacs. It's embarassing.
  
Earlier you said you would like to fix?
  
Yes.
  
I see... Well, are you sure that this is so?
  
Right. I want the bugs to be fixed but I also want to get other things done.
  
Is it because you also want to get other things done that you came to me?
  
Yes. Emacs stops me from getting other things done.
  
Are you sure?
  
No, maybe it's just me. Maybe I need to... stop configuring Emacs?
  
My secretary will send you a bill.
  
It worked for me. You can run Emacs' psychotherapist with M-x doctor RET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know there is a ton of discussion around this but i'm not sure i've found my "perfect" solution yet. Maybe some of can weigh in on which path is "worth" following.
 Basically, i come from vim and neovim. I've worked with emas and neovim in parallel for years now. I generally enjoy the "regular" emacs keybindings for UI stuff. But i feel like i'm lossing a LOT of editing power when leaving evil behind. Yet, getting it to work consistently is a bunch of work and it'll always be 99% at best.
 Now the relevant part. I'm pretty sure i've only scratched the surface of emacs native keybinds. What i find missing is "simple" stuff like "delete between paranthesis" or "duplicate this line". Is this something emacs can "just do" and i just haven't found it yet?
 I see 2 ways forward:
  
Stick with evil and invest the time to create consistent remaps where evil-collection and others don't quite do it.
 Stick to emacs and remap/write functionality i'm missing from vim
  
Note that ergonomics are a secondary thought. I have a custom keyboard so arrow keys are still on hjkl and modifiers are on thumbkeys. I'm also not married to the idea of modal editing. In fact, i enjoy not having to worry about modes and just "type away". But deleting/changing a specified area is just something i haven't found a good solution in emacs to.
 So, thoughts? Is what i'm missing from emacs just there and i need to find it, or am i better of investing fully into evil and making that work?

 But when I put the buffer into column mode, those settings lines are messing up my view of things; in particular they are creating a gap between column view's column headers, and the various column-ized headings down below in the buffer proper.
 Is there a way to hide all that settings cruft so I get a cleaner view in column mode? (Actually, it would be nice to be able to hide it at all times, but it's worst in column mode).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[nothunks-0.2.0 is available on Hackage. The new version can point out exact location of unwanted thunks (which could lead to space leaks), e.g. haskell ThunkInfo { thunkInfo = Right "fromModel :: Int @ test/Test/NoThunks/Class.hs:198:53-84" }  This is only supported when compiling with ghc-9.4 or newer (although the feature needed to support it is available since ghc-9.2), and requires -finfo-table-map (if -fdistinct-constructor-tables is added the location information will be more precise, and thus it's recommended for debugging space leaks with nothunks).
 When info tables are not available the type context is available, which was supported in earlier versions.
 The new version also includes a few more instances of some data types exposed by base package, e.g. various semigroup & monoid newtype wrappers and the Solo data type.
 I would like to thank IOG for supporting this work and colleagues from Well-Typed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am working on small mode for editing pal files, which is a poor-man calendar agenda.
 Everything is more-less done, and almost ready to write a blog about it, but I am facing the problem with faces.
 Problem: custom defined faces are not displaying (at all).
 My definitions:
 (defface pal-todo-face '((t (:foreground "orange red"))) "Face for word TODO") (font-lock-add-keywords 'pal-mode '(("TODO" . 'pal-todo-face))) (add-hook 'pal-mode-hook (lambda () (font-lock-mode 1))) (defun pal-mode-set-face () "Set the face function for pal-mode." (setq-local font-lock-defaults '(pal-mode-font-lock-keywords))) (add-hook 'pal-mode-hook 'pal-mode-set-face) 
 Where pal-mode is defined as:
 (defun pal-mode () "Major mode for editing pal files" (interactive) (setq major-mode 'pal-mode mode-name "Pal")) 
 I use a similar approach to define custom faces for tcl-mode and other extensions. There it works.... 
 Where could be the snag here?
 Thanks for any idea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To follow up on my previous demo of text editing, I have a new demo on using LLMs to manipulate org-mode in a structured way.
 This shows using LLMs to produce JSON, which I then turn into both subheadings in the first part of the demo, and task estimates in the last part. This is part of an effort I'm making to find a good way to support more complicated LLM interactions than we've seen so far. This one isn't just showing the ability to get structured output, but also the ability to refine the previous results as part of a "conversation" with the LLM that started in the first interaction. I haven't seen these things being done before, but I may be missing something. The details and code links can be found in https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-01/msg01134.html.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I'm Binny, originally from India but currently living in Lisbon. I'm a Software Engineer(web dev, full stack) by profession.
I discovered Zettelkasten in 2020 when I started working on a rather large personal project called MindOS. I was trying to create content in the intersection of philosophy, psychology, programming and rationality. During the research phase, I understood that it was going to be impossible to keep all of this in my mind - even with the note taking method that I used at that stage. I needed a better system.
This search led me to Zettelkasten, and I immediately fell in love with it! Since then I have actively trying to encourage others to use it as well. To do this, I have written tutorials, videos, created a couple of tools, etc. But my biggest and most resent contribution is a book I wrote and published a few months back: Zettelkasten and the Art of Knowledge Management.
My Zettelkasten Process...
I have 2 vaults. Everything I learn that is useful for others go into Obsidian - and I publish it as a Digital Garden at https://notes.binnyva.com
All my personal information goes into a Logseq graph. This includes...

 The thing that is confounding me right now is how to extract the value of the point.

 I've been exploring adapting imenu, since markdown-mode supports it and it seems to do 90% what I want to do, but I'm stuck at actually extracting the point and giving it to org-capture.
 Is there something I'm missing? Is there a better way to do this?

 I need your help/guidance on adapting to Emacs.
 Since 2011, I'm was a full-time macOS user, until some months ago when I decided to stop supporting companies like Apple and brought a new PC and putted NixOS on it; I'm still using macOS for my day job, the company doesn't allow me to use Linux. This was the moment where I put myself in trouble.
 Firstly, I was really productive on macOS and using the CMD key in combination with the arrows to move around on the line, quickly select and all of that. These are the moves that I'm missing more on, coming back to Linux. The need to use a Home and End key to do the same thing is killing my productivity, mainly due to the fact there is no dedicated key to do that on my laptop keyboard or on the Keychron K6.
 On my Mac I used to use VS…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I finally picked Scala 3 for my new product and I'd like to share some experience. Overall, it's a tool for reservations. Involves a bunch of CRUD. Nothing special or particularly challenging. The stack was classic "spartan": Tapir, ZIO, Quill, Circe, Cats...
 The good:
 Tapir folks nailed it! That's pretty much all I can say about them. ZIO also worked flawlessly. Quill was a pleasant surprise since it was the spot where I expected most of the obstacles. Although, the general documentation of Quill could be improved. E.g. in the context of structure, more examples, etc. But in all fairness, well done.
 The bad:
 Some things do not work quite well with new Scala features. E.g. a lot of hacking around various encoders and decoders for opaque types or enums. Some libraries are still not supported which is bonkers. E.g. I miss Scalamock and Cornichon.
 The ugly:
 Tooling. The neverending story... Let's begin with Metals. Metals is like a... musket. Sometimes it fires, sometimes it misfires, and sometimes explodes straight to your face. In a lot of cases, I had to kill its Java process, remove the target dir., and reimport the project. Funny enough, IntelliJ worked okish. With, few error reports when there are no actual errors. However, the experience is kind of clunkier than with Scala 2. Also, I noticed that sometimes incremental compilation doesn't work quite well and you can end up with some weird behavior.
 The unnecessary: 
 Indentation syntax. I don't want to start a rant... especially if I start asking questions about how much time and resources this feature required. Especially, since Scala has much greater "burning issues". In all fairness, I didn't see any benefit from having this.
 To conclude: 
 The experience was ok, spiced with some rough edges. From a Scala beginner's perspective, I presume it would be quite nasty. Overall, there's still a lot of work to do.

 So far, I failed to motivate my dear wife to use GNU Emacs with Org-mode for her knowledge-management.
 Therefore, I had to look for alternatives. I looked into Joplin and Logseq and summarized my findings on my blog: https://karl-voit.at/2024/01/28/logseq-from-org-pov
 I hope you don't mind the slightely off-topic character.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probably it's been asked many times, still, I'm not sure which way should I go.
 I'm hungarian, and my solution to write hungarian in emacs (which I have barely done) was that I just simply typed "auoeiuo" instead of "áúüű....".
 Lately I started to have the need to write text for others, so using the correct vowels with "umlauts" became needed more and more often. It would be amazing if I could just simply switch layout and go on with my life not fighting with my muscle memory. Most often I still use us layout, not only because of the shortcuts, but also typing special characters like \, [], etc... on hungarian layout really a pain in the ass. On hungarian layout I will almost never use any "programming characters", I'm pretty sure.
 The problem I have for example is that "C-_" is "C-Ü" or "C-y" is "C-z" on hungarian layout, which doesn't work anymore. I don't want to learn different combinations, neither fighting my muscle memory every time when once a week I want to write some longer hungarian text in emacs.
 I have a feeling that there could be a trick that any time i'm using a different layout, (and probably I should also put a condition that I'm in txt mode for not mess up things like dired or magit), emacs would interpret my keystrokes differently when I hold down C or M. So I would use the same key for typing a single "ü" and "C-_" for example.
 What could be the simplest way to set up emacs like that? Can you post me a link where it's already answered? I'm pretty sure it's been answered a couple of times, I'm just too stupid to find it.
 Thank you!

 Failed to request slack-authorize: invalid_auth 
 I've included slack in my dotspacemacs-configuration-layers, and here is what I have in my dotspacemacs/user-config (with personal parts redacted): 
  (slack-register-team :name "emacs-slack" :default t :client-id "xxx@xxx.com" :client-secret "xoxd-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" :token "xoxc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" :subscribed-channels '(general slackbot)) 
 I got the client-secret and token by following the direction in the emacs-slack package (as directed by the spacemacs slack layer documentation). 
 There does seem to be some differences in nomenclature between the spacemacs layer and emacs-slack, maybe I'm entering the wrong thing? And the instructions for the spacemacs layer doesn't go into enough detail. Is name suppose to be the name of the slack team I use? Is client-secret the same as the d cookie from the emacs-slack instructions or is it my password? 
 If someone has it working could you provide a copy of your user-config entry (with the personal stuff redacted of course, but not so much that I can't tell if I'm doing it right or wrong.) and maybe some details about each of the items?
 It does seem that emacs-slack isn't under development any more, maybe it just doesn't work anymore?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 This is part of my effort to replace my three TiddlyWiki instances with org files. I've looked at a number of conversion tools written by others, and ended up rolling a small(-ish) Perl script to do about 90% of the conversion, from a JSON export of a given TW instance.
 The first TW instance I've converted is a journal of my scale modeling projects. In it, I have future projects, current projects, and completed projects. I would like it if the completed projects (all of which have a tag "Completed" on their level-1 headline) were folded. I read in the manual that adding :VISIBILITY: folded to the properties drawer would do this, but it didn't work for me. And, as I already have a tag unique to these headlines, it would be great if I could trigger this based on the tag.
 Is there a way to run elisp code when an org file is first opened, specific to a file, with which I could do this? I suppose it could be done with a hook, but I would likely want code to be specific to a given file. (That is, I might have a similar-but-different need in the other files I'm yet to convert.)
 Thanks!

 but when i enter the org-columns view it is a complete mess as i have variable pitch and visual-fill-columns mode enabled , the big font size in org-columns headings flow to more then one line and different heading levels are indented differently due to their different font size.
 what i want in theory
 is to toggle the enlarged heights of the headings temporarily while in org-columns mode to normal settings and then toggle back when i leave the org-columns 
 is it possible in emacs? or is it something else that i need but i dont know about it

I'm looking at the high switching costs of how I've set up my ZK. It seems I've boxed myself in with some basic decisions about file naming and linking conventions.
Young Adult Literature as a genre ripe for literary criticism.
Uni Class has started, so I'm finding most of my thinking is slanted toward Young Adult Literature.
Things I'm reading:
Gratz, Alan. Refugee. 2017.
Tucci, Stanley. Taste: my life through food. 2021.
Gantos, Jack. Dead end in Norvelt. 2013.
Picard, Max. The world of silence. 1948.
Music I'm listening to:
House Music to zettelkast with.
Passenger
★★★★★
The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When typing up some long-form text for entry into a website, I'll sometimes do it first in Org mode and then once I'm happy with it I'll copy-paste it into whatever I'm using. 
 However, one issue is that of <NEWLINE>.
 On the one hand, web forms often want to handle line wrapping, and so it wants the user to insert <NEWLINE> characters only if really necessary; e.g. for between paragraphs, list items, and so on.
 But on the other hand, I have Org set up to auto-fill text input (and I'll also regularly give it a hand in that using M-q to run org-fill-paragraph), so I end up with <NEWLINE> characters all over the place.
 Now obviously I could just turn off emacs and Org's auto-fill for the purpose of these situations. But I don't want that. I actually *want* the Org text formatted with the auto-fills, just as it would be if I wasn't creating something for input on the web.
 So, is there a simple way (maybe using export? ) to have the newlines that are not needed (I'm thinking it's only newlines within a paragraph) replaced with what is almost certainly going to be a simple inter-word space? Note , though, that it isn't just going to be the newline that needs to go, but also any following indenting whitespace characters used to correctly position the next piece of text.
 For example, I'd like to have this:
  1. A line of text 2. Another line of text but this one is long enough to need to be wrapped. And notice that this portion is indented.  converted to:  1. A line of text 2. Another line of text but this one is long enough to need to be wrapped. And notice that this portion is indented.

 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version in a couple of weeks.
 I would to like thank Théophile Batoz. His sustained efforts cleared a long-standing issue and Stack can now build packages with dependencies on public sub-libraries of other packages.
 Release notes:
  
After an upgrade from an earlier version of Stack, on first use only, Stack 2.15.1 may warn that it had trouble loading the CompilerPaths cache.
 The hash used as a key for Stack’s pre-compiled package cache has changed, following the dropping of support for Cabal versions older than 1.24.0.0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I've been trying for the past month or so to get Emacs working reliably and quickly on my High DPI linux machines, but have been struggling.
 Currently I am running into issues with a machine running Manjaro + GNOME (wayland) and the pgtk version of emacs 29.1. When I scale the frame to take up the entirety of my 4k display, I have noticeable input lag, likely in the 100s of ms. When I shrink the frame down, my input lag decreases significantly, and emacs feels snappy. The issue persists when I run emacs with emacs -q.
 At the moment I've resorted to running emacs 29.1 without pgtk, forcing it to run under XWayland. This causes emacs to render at a lower resolution to XWayland, resulting in blurry text when it's finally displayed on my monitor, but results in emacs staying snappy even at full screen.
 I've run into this issue across all my machines, across distros (namely Void, Arch, and Fedora), whenever I try to run Emacs full screen on a 4K monitor attached to a machine running Wayland. Switching to X isn't an option due to the excessive screen tearing that I get at high resolutions.
 Weirdly, compiling and running Emacs on my Windows work machine natively results in the best emacs experience I've had so far, with input feeling extremely snappy and fluid. I don't experience the scaling issues there. Emacs also is working fantastic on an old low resolution laptop that I have running Void with XFCE.
 I've tried adjusting the double buffering as mentioned in this post without success: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/zgp6kw/gui_emacs_weird_the_bigger_the_frame_size_is_the/
 Any thoughts? Is this a thing that people are running into on high resolution displays with Wayland? Is XWayland the best bet right now?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Folks! I am currently pursuing the Typesafe Introductory Scala for Data Science. I have to qualify this in order to get the job as a data scientist so my career hinges on this. I am currently unemployed and this offer is the only one I have hence am a bit tensed. If anyone has done this certification, can you help answer some questions?
 1) What kind of questions are asked in this?
 2) How many tries do I get?
 3)What would be the level of difficulty of questions?
 4)Do I have to code in the test?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am starting a company and I love developing with Scala. I feel way more confident about my apps when built with Scala, they end up being a lot less buggy and generally easier to understand. My cofounder is used to Python, he’s been coding in Python for like 15 years (I have too) but I also have used JS and Scala in my career. Two jobs ago I only used Scala and my most recent job was only Python. The transition back to Python from Scala was so disappointing. I HATED it. Everything felt so sloppy and disorganized. 
 My co-founder has only ever used Python. He’s extremely resistant to learning Scala. he feels very certain we should be using Python for all of our backend services because it’s easier, there are more libraries and it will be easier to hire devs in the future. 
 Anyone have any advice or opinions on this? Is it unreasonable for me to continue to convince him to use Scala? Am I being too opinionated about what stack we should be using?

 I like to minimize visible markup, and keep colors to a minimum. Basically I want this to look similar to a rendered markdown page on github.
 So: I have emphasis markers hidden, visual line mode, org-bullets, checkboxes with unicode substitution, startup indented and org-pretty-table
 Mouse support is on because I like to click checkboxes and switch TODO state that way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I don't live my life in Emacs, but I have come to the conclusion that Emacs plugins are often among the best tools for doing the particular job they do.
 I need to manage my contacts with an extensible tool. Availability is a must - they have to be sync-able on all my devices with ease. Ease of backing them up is also very important to me. Integration with Emacs mail clients is also very important. I don't use an Emacs mua at the moment, but I plan on using notmuch.
 I have come across this post on the subreddit. Right now, it seems to me like bbdb or ebdb are options that would suit my needs, but I have doubts. I know people in the Emacs community are very vocal about how great various features/packages are (and why everything is better in Emacs), but I haven't really found content on managing contacts with Emacs.
 Is there a general favorite of the community in regards to contact-management packages? How come nobody really talks about this? Is it better to do this outside of Emacs? Thank you!

 Recently I discovered denote, a young and excellent package to organize notes in files, and I have to say that I'm really enjoying it. However, it requires me to reorganize my long org file (which is good, after so many years growing out of control).
 I would like to ask, first of all, somebody with similar experiences, why did you decided to switch to denote? Or to stay with a long org file?
 The long org file works for me in a way that I simply come to the file and search for a particular word, so I can easily access all the results and choose the one I want. I don't even use tags, everything is organized in sectons using headers. How do you make that search easy in denote? I know that using keywords is the best but, assuming that sometimes you are not even 100% sure about the exact word that you need and you type in a few to try.
 On the other hand, small files work better for my mobile (where I sync my notes), specially with zettel notes app, which has similar organization than denote. However, I wonder if somebody has a good experience with a long org file with some particular app for android.
 I'm still trying to decide if switching to denote or staying with my long org file. Any comments would be appreciated.

I've been using org-mode for note-taking, and I'm also learning e lisp introduction guide in Emacs, I'm trying to set up org-indent-mode to enable when I'm in normal mode and disable when I'm in insert mode. So I could read my note more clearly.
 I came across a code snippet on EmacsWiki that changes the mode line color based on the Evil state, but I'm having trouble understanding and adapting it for org-indent-mode. 
 So I wrote this code to achieve this
 (defun escape () "Change org-indent-mode based on evil state" (interactive) (if (evil-normal-state-p) (org-indent-mode 1) (org-indent-mode -1))) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'escape) 
 It work when I type M-x escape , I know the problem but i don't know to solve it, the problem i think is it is checking for first time and but not observing the change in state.
 I really appreciate any help 💖

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Org for repeating meeting notes for several years. My workflow
 is something like:
  
for each person I regularly meet I have a top level bullet.
 every time I have a meeting with that person, I find the top level bullet, and create a new child bullet, with the date of the meeting and the topic - I have two usual topica, being "catch up" and"review".
 under that new bullet I type my notes from the meeting. These are usually transcribed from paper notes I make during the meeting.
  
E.g
 * Ann Onymous
 ** <2023-08-22 Thu> catchup
 Ann is having fun working on cold-fusion. Needs new peanut butter and
 mousetraps. Says warm weather is interfering with correct function of
 reverse osmosis proton macerator.
 Needs me to sort out climate and mousetraps.
 ** <2023-09-20 Wed> catchup
 new mousetraps have made life better. Climate still not good enough...
 ​
 Having watched (in bits, over a week or two admiteddly) Prot's 'tube explanations, and done a basic installation of Denote, I want to make it work for my note taking needs. I'm in no way wedded to the arrangement shown above. I'd happily have a file per person. But I think Denote wants me to have a file per meeting. But for me, a big part of the value is continuity. I.e. being able to see what happened in previous meetings so I can be sure to follow up on actions, and keep a proxixmate record of outstanding actions and conclusions.
 I think this means that I might use Denote by having a file per meeting, with keywords like "talking_to_Ann_Onymous" and then use a dynamic block to gather the rolling textual status. By playing with the frontmatter I could include the date of each meeting. Further, I think I would use the signature fucntions to ensure that the notes are displayed in calendar order.
 Has someone else solved this kind of problem? Did you find a better way to handle this kind of note taking?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m wondering if there is some roadmap, or blog posts devoted to the future of the Scala language. I was looking through Rust's blog posts and the Rust team does an amazing job describing “what’s next” for the language. In addition to that, there are a lot of blog posts from core language contributors that also give a view on the language evolution which is pretty cool. I could not find any of that for Scala. I read periodically Scala Contributors but it’s more like the discussion of potential improvements and separate proposals. Before 3.3.0 it was stabilization and road to LTS. But now it’s not that clear. 
 It would be nice to have periodical blog posts related to the future of the language and the vision of language designers, a road map that is periodically updated. 
 Not the list of new features (we’re adding this because <lang X> has it), but why these features are important, how they will affect language, etc.

 So I'm setting up evil mode and so far it works pretty well for me. The only thing that doesn't really fit what I'm used to is actions that span multiple lines. The starting and ending lines are not included completely in this action but only from (and on the ending line up to) the position of the cursor. 
 If I had this text ([x] is the cursor position):
  This is[x] a test line Another line to test 
 and then do dj I would end up with this result
  This is line to test 
 I would expect it to just delete both lines. What do I need to configure to get the desired behaviour? The current behaviour is active for all commands that can span multiple lines like yank, delete and so on

As i see i have 3 options: 1) for each minibuffer mode i use to bind <escape> to minibuffer-keyboard-quit, 2) for each to remap keyboard-quit to minibuffer-keyboard-quit, 3) to remap for all minibuffer modes.
 How can do 3?
  
Also, side question. Why don't more packages simply rebind existing (fundamental) functions instead of invent/make us bind new keys?
 I am exploring vertigo/consult (currently ivy/counsel user) and it striked me how friendly transition to vertgo was in terms of keys. I have to learn nothing new, all keys are intuitive. Vertigo simply remaps fundamental functions to vertigo functions. Screenshot - https://imgur.com/a/isc9iYv
 Why don't more packages do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background to the problem.
 I use the GUI form designer on Lazarus which saves changes to the form to a text file and in manipulating the form elements, spurious changes are made that I don't want.
 For instance if a form is moved around the screen during the edits, the top and left positions of the form are saved to the file even if they are not relevant to the task. Adjusting the size of an element to gain access to some other elements also result in spurios changes.
 Is there some way to revert those changes from the Magit diff view and only commit those desired?
 I know how to stage and commit tht hunks I need but I also need to revert the unwanted uncommitted changes in the working copy.
 Logically I can commit only the changes I want and check the file out again to restore the unwanted changes back to their original setting, but that applies to files containing hunks I have no use for.
 BONUS INFO
 After a bit of searching around I have realized that in addition to Magit there are quite a few package that provide the same functionality, two of those I already have installed.
  
diff-hl
 git-undo
 git-gutter-plus
 git-gutter
  
Searching for stuff is difficult when you don't know or can't recollect the right terminology. All I had to do was to enter C-h f - hunk and their commands would have showed up.

 So without any recourse, since the variable is defined using 'defconst` as opposed to `defcustom' and `setq` wouldnt work - I had to patch the source in ox-latex.el as

 I hope this change is undone as it proved to be a source of my many miseries and many more that will have a rather rude awakening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a feeling there must be a package for this kind of thing but I don't even know what I would use as a search string and I'm getting :side-eye from the LLMs atm... 
 There are languages which have CLI tooling to automate the dev+test loop. As an example from Rust there is: 
 cargo watch 
 which will watch the directory for file changes and automatically run tests when a file changes. 
 There are other languages/tools which don't have that sort of thing (or for which the tooling is just getting going). As an example, here's a much simplified version of what I do in the shell for Terraform: 
 while true; do fsnotifywait -r -e close_write . ; terraform plan && terraform apply -auto-approve ; sleep 2; done 
 There must be an Emacs package which combines the ability to watch a directory for changes and then automatically execute a pipeline like the above, yes? 
 NOTE: Emacs LSP is fine for fmt and lint in most cases I've encountered. Also, yes, there is better tooling for automated testing in TF now. Like I said, that loop is much simplified.
  
EDIT: Interestingly, here's what I eventually managed to get out of an LLM for non-elisp tools perhaps reachable via an Emacs package:
  
 Tool Name Language Written In Recursive Watch Support Config File Support in Work Directory Latest Release Date Emacs Package Available 
  
 inotify-tools C Yes No Sep 12, 2023 No 
  fswatch C++ Yes No Jul 1, 2023 No 
  Watchman C++ Yes Yes Jan 22, 2024 Yes (emacs-watchman) 
  entr C No No Not available No 
  nodemon JavaScript Yes Yes Jan 16, 2024 No 
  Git Hooks Various (Shell, Python, etc.) Not Applicable Yes (via scripts) Not applicable Not directly, but can be used with Emacs 
  watchexec Rust Yes No Jan 5, 2024 No

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of orgs big strengths is its ability to emit code. I use org-tangle for my literate emacs config, org-export for producing PDFs and HTML, and a variation of org-export MD for producing my Hugo blog posts. But I am unconfident about when org will skip lines. Is my understanding correct?
  
 It seems that timestamps, including inactive timestamps, and DEADLINE and SCHEDULED are ALWAYS output. I wish this weren't so.
  When tangling, COMMENT on a heading (shortcut key #) is skipped. I don't know if this omits things from org-agenda.
  When marked with :ARCHIVE:, lines are skipped in org-agenda. I use this for optimizing long repeating sequences so that I only have one chunk (month, or school semester) at a time.
  DEADLINES can have their visibility shortened with syntax like <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp"><2024-01-25 Thu -2d></span></span>; however, the same seems to break stuff if put into SCHEDULED instead.
 
Traditional syntax commenting with literal =# = at line start in an org file omits from all of the above, I think. But I'm not sure.
 Is this as confusing as I see, or is there a unifying principle here?

There is virtually no delay that I can even notice but when I use lsp mode with rust-analyzer on a rust file, the completion never pops up no matter what I do.

 I have all my projects under ~/Documents/projects. In Emacs I ran projectile-discover-projects-in-directory and then in the input (not sure what Emacs people call it?) I entered the path ~/Documents/projects, the first time I ran it, it actually did something, took about 10 seconds. It probably indexed those projects. But if I try to switch projects, no projects show.
 I'm still quite new to Emacs, so I attempted to run the function in my config.
 (setq org-directory "~/org/" projectile-project-search-path '("~/Documents/projects/")) 
 But it also doesn't work...
 As I said, still quite new to Emacs, so I don't know how to check for Error messages, the *Messages* buffer is empty tho.

 Edit: Projects are all git repos.

 What i want to achieve is to have main font for buffer around height 11-12, and org tables height 10.
 Problem right now org table face seem to take minimal line height from main font seize disregarding their font size. So they are a bit heigher than they should be.
 Screenshots:
 main font 10, org table face 10 https://imgur.com/a/hntoqNS (rows are ideal height)
 main font 10.5, org table face 10 https://imgur.com/a/qvxOeI9 (rows are a bit heigher than optimal)
 main font 30, org table face 10 https://imgur.com/a/8u3PAWL (rows ... you can tell :) there is no extra linese here - it's a 3 row table)
 Is this how it supposed to work, or did i mess something up? I swear before update to emacs 29 / org 9.6.6 rows had line height 10 (not 10.5) with my normal set up of main font 10.5. But maybe it was always like this...

 ``` data Pattern = Var String | Fn String [Pattern]
 data Rule = Rule Pattern Pattern
 -- (f ?a 1) ==> (g ?a) rule = Rule (Fn "f" [Var "a", Fn "1" []]) (Fn "g" [Var "a"]) -- Invalid rule: (f ?a 1) ==> (g ?b) invalidRule = Rule (Fn "f" [Var "a", Fn "1" []]) (Fn "g" [Var "b"]) ```
 Informally, if an expressions "matches" the LHS, this binds each pattern variable to an expression, and then we substitute these into the RHS.
 The problem is that this representation doesn't prevent me from writing invalid rules. In particular, I'd like to prevent variable binding issues: I'd like to enforce that all pattern variables that appear on the right hand side must appear on the left hand side. (It's fine for variables to appear multiple times in a pattern.) Is there a way to do this? Maybe with some HOAS approach?

 When developing React projects, I often stumble over something called "Styled Components", which are altered ReactJS components with CSS applied to it. It looks like this:
 export const AssetColumnHeader = styled(Div)` display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: flex-start; font-family: ${({ theme }) => theme.fonts.primary}; color: ${({ theme }) => theme.colors[theme.textColors.primary.color][ theme.textColors.primary.intensity ]}; strong { font-weight: 600; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; } `; 
 My major mode is typescript-ts-mode.
 I'd like to have "css-ts-mode" inside the space delimited by `...` (backticks). With the exception of ${ ... }, which is Javascript/Typescript (also typescript-ts-mode).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm relatively new to Emacs (28) and spent the holidays configuring it to be a nice environment for machine learning applications and writing Latex/org-mode markup. Loving it so far.
 However, one thing I wish I could change is the major modes for C, C++, Python, and Shell languages. I tend to get really overwhelmed by how many options are provided because of the maturity of these languages and it's hard for me to really learn their features even with which-key installed. Another sticking point is that they sometimes overwrite custom keybinds that I use frequently, especially c-mode.
 Is there such a thing as a general purpose coding major mode that just provides syntax highlighting with tree-sitter, code folding, and Eldoc info for each language? Maybe this is something that would be easy to hack up by extending prog-mode with only those features?
 Barring that, is there a way to help simplify the major modes like not overriding my global keymap? I have a difficult time with mental context switching and want to only need to think about my basic keybinds and org stuff.

I am creating a growing list of the benefits of the Zettelkasten Method. This is in itself neither new nor exciting, since it would be a repetition of the marketing babble already existing in the domain of knowledge management.
My take will be to highlight the steps of the causal mechanism how the benefit is created. There is a lot of talk about that the Zettelkasten gives you a certain set of benefits, sometimes a blurry idea of the how. There is a lack of explicitness and precision. This is what I am going for.
So, my request is for you: Give me every benefit you can think of. Being it a benefit that you want to be justified or rejected. Being it a benefit that you experienced. Being a benefit that other's claim and you are not sure about.
GIVE ME EVERYTHING!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often find myself working with two (or more) buffers open in Emacs: actively writing in one while needing to search in the other.Is there a way to search in the secondary buffer without moving the cursor from the primary buffer? I've tried multi-isearch-buffers, but it doesn't search when I press RET, seems buggy.
 My current method is:
  
Switch to the second buffer.
 Perform an I-search.
 Switch back to the first buffer to continue writing.
 Repeat as needed.
  
This workflow feels cumbersome. Does anyone have suggestions for a more efficient approach?

Somehow after a lot of effort, I made it work but then I was looking at this article: https://www.lightbend.com/akka/license-faq which made my heart skip a beat. Since Akka had super powerful capabilities, especially for concurrent apps is this end for scala? Are the older functionalities like Akka streaming and all still under Apache 2.0 or they would also be affected by this? Any alternatives for all this?
 I know what Akka is requesting makes sense but I can't convince my business owners to get one license. They are instead insisting me to migrate to some other microservice or framework. :/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm having trouble installing lsp-java on Mac. Installing the package itself is easy; however, installing the `jdtls` lsp is proving to be difficult. 
 Since it is on a work laptop, I cannot provide log messages. My first issue was when the script that LSP runs to install jdtls failed to install due to cert issues. I was able to fix those, but I ran into error `java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty`. I tried fixing the cert store, but no luck.
 The next thing I tried was doing `brew install jdtls`. I tried setting `lsp-java-server-install-dir` to the install location of the jdtls binary; however, that also did not work. For some reason, LSP cannot find the `jdtls` in my path, even though it's available globally on my system. FWIW, I am using package exec-path-from-shell, and it's properly configured (other packages that depend on external tools work just fine). 
 I was wondering if anyone has had any luck getting lsp-java to work on Mac, especially if you went the `brew install jdtls` route. Thanks in advance!

 Installation
 Use the Melpa Emacs Lisp archive to install this as a regular package:
 ```lisp (package-install 'ert-results)
 (require 'ert-results) ```
 or install it directly from the Github archive above as it is a single file code library.
 ert-results.el Rationale
 Within an interactive Emacs session, if ert is called with a regular expression selector argument that matches to multiple test names, all such tests are run, but only a summary line of output is displayed for all passing tests. Thus, the names of the passing matched tests are not displayed. Presently, within the ert output buffer, you must press {j} on each individual test summary result to display and jump to the test name and have its status spelled out.

 I hope you're all doing well. I'm currently a chemical engineer working in scientific software development, and from a couple of months ago I've been diving into Haskell. It sparkled the desire to eventually transition to a job where I can use this fantastic language on a daily basis.
 I've gone through a few Haskell books and even tackled some challenges like Advent of Code 2023, which was a great experience. However, as I start thinking about applying Haskell to real-world problems, I find myself lacking the confidence I need to navigate the complexities that may arise.
 For those of you who have made a similar learning journey or have experience working with Haskell professionally, I'd love to hear your advice on how to bridge the gap from solving algorithmic challenges to confidently handling real-world projects. Are there specific resources, projects, or practices that you found particularly helpful in your journey?
 I appreciate any words of wisdom you can share with me as I go on this exciting but challenging journey. Thanks in advance for your support!

 I have a config for which-key in my keybindings, intended to show a minibuffer when hitting the <leader key> + <some key>. For example:
 (use-package general :config (general-evil-setup) (general-create-definer felipe/leader-keys :states '(normal insert emacs) :keymaps 'override :prefix "SPC" :global-prefix "M-SPC") (felipe/leader-keys "b" '(:ignore t :wk "buffer") ... "b p" '(previous-buffer :wk "Previous buffer")) 
 When I run (SPC + "b p") the command works just fine (as all the others combinations of b + ...)
 However, when I hit only (SPC + b) It does nothing, and I get the following message:
 Error running timer 'which-key--update': (void-function-which-key-order-alpha) 
 I already tried updating the package via elpaca-manager (elpaca is my pkg manager) but It seems to bu already up to date.
 Does anyone know how to solve this issue?
 Thanks a lot in advance!

Should I expect package incompatibility? I am using a lot of MELPA packages!
 What version better to use? From PPA or Snap?
 Both repositories offer 29.1, not 29.2. Should I wait for 29.2?
 What is the easiest way to migrate all my installed packages?
  
Any other migration hints and warnings are greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for advice on how to handle use cases where a repeating task has to be temporarily rescheduled and then reset back to its normal timestamp. 
 For example, say I have a repeating task that occurs once a month on the 17th. A month comes up where I need to reschedule this task to the 18th. Once the task is complete, I then have to remember that it usually occurs on the 17th and manually set it back to that date. 
 A similar issue comes up when I have to change just the time of day of daily task while organizing my day. I then have to remember to change the date back at the end of the day. 
 Manually resetting daily tasks back to their normal time of day is a particularly tedious chore, because I have quite a few of them and their times are fairly intricate. 
 Is there a less manual way to handle these use cases? Ideally, I would like the tasks to be set back to their normal time slots automatically.

Problem is, that the implementation being more elegant, doesn't necessarily make something more useful in practice. Can someone who used both roam and denote give me a practical sales pitch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 it's a bit of an open-ended question I guess.
 Is this just me or org feels very unfriendly to build on top of? Is there a public API I could use to perform some org-related actions?
 Example:
 I don't like the way todo items in the agenda are displayed and the configuration is pretty poor (I believe you can only configure the prefix and even that isn't that powerful). So I figured I should just write my own view for todo items. Well, I couldnt find any documentation for that. I figured the only way is to go through the source code (which is a huge blob of a file that I'm not sure how to navigate efficiently) and hack my way into it (which may end up being incompatible with future versionsk break features, etc)
 Another example:
 I'd like to collect some data across all my org files. I don't see any "org" way to grab all my files, convert them to some sort of objects, and grab some data I need. The closest I found is the Element API which seems to do with parsing org files and I'm not even sure that's an official package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm starting to use column view, and one thing I'd like to see is a column showing when any given captured item was created. Any ideas how to do this? 
 FWIW, here's what I've tried so far.
 I had hoped that the Special Property, TIMESTAMP_IA would give me what I'm after, but I can't get that to work. So far I've tried:
  
Relying on the fact that I usually clock-in when capturing, and so the datum I want is almost always already there for me, in the form of the start time for the earliest clock entry. But TIMESTAMP_IA appears to ignore timestamps that are part of clock entries. So this is no use.
 Having my capture templates create a property drawer into which gets inserted a new property called CREATED, with value of %u. That does allow me to see the value in column view, but it is under %CREATED, not under %TIMESTAMP_IA.
 Same as #3, but instead of having the CREATED property inserted into the property drawer, insert it into my logbook drawer. That does let me see the value under %TIMESTAMP_IA but bizarrely it then does not display it under %CREATED. 
  
So either #2 or #3 could work, but I consider them to be non-ideal. 
 With #2, I don't get to use the built-inTIMESTAMP_IA which I get the feeling is really intended for the kind of thing I'm trying to do. 
 And while with #3, I do get to use TIMESTAMP_IA, it is at the expense of having to insert my CREATED property into a non-property drawer, which something in the back of my mind says is ill-advised. 
 And of course with both #2 and #3, unnecessary duplication is involved since, as I said, the date I want is already staring me in the face in the starting stamp of the first clock entry. Having to go around creating properties for the sole purpose of duplicating and making available an otherwise unavailable variable is, well, naff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: This has now been solved, see https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-wlroots-bindings/8426/45.
 (This is a repost of a Discourse post in the hopes of getting more responses. This issue is actively impacting my ability to maintain wlhs, so I would appreciate any ideas!)
 For the past few weeks, I and others have been developing wlhs, a set of Haskell bindings to libwayland and wlroots. For the most part, development on my side has run fairly smoothly.
 However, when I tried to build wlhs two days ago, I received the following error:
 $ cabal build Resolving dependencies... Error: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies: [__0] next goal: wlhs-bindings (user goal) [__0] rejecting: wlhs-bindings-0.1.0 (conflict: pkg-config package wayland-server-any, not found in the pkg-config database) [__0] fail (backjumping, conflict set: wlhs-bindings) After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: wlhs-bindings 
 Despite the error message saying that wayland-server is ‘not found in the pkg-config database’, it clearly is present on my system:
 $ pkg-config --modversion wayland-server 1.22.0 
 What makes this strange is how suddenly it stopped working. Two days ago, I couldn’t build wlhs; the day before, I could. (Or at least, I have no memory of it failing before that.) Does anyone have any ideas around how to fix this problem?
 For reference, I’m using pkgconf-2.1.0. (Installed on December 7, so that hasn’t changed recently.) I have also tested several Cabal versions: it fails with 3.10.2.1 and 3.10.1.0, as well as current HEAD. It does succeed with cabal-3.6.2.0, but that version is unusable for me as it can’t handle my custom Setup.hs. I’m running EndeavourOS, which is a variant of Arch Linux.

This enables distinct teams to work on separate services without interrupting the overall workflow—a level of flexibility rarely seen in alternative architectural approaches. Additionally, the next generation approach—multi-runtime architecture—is gaining more attention. In this blog post, we explain both concepts, as well as their benefits and limitations compared to the monolithic architecture.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I plan to work on a series of demos of more complicated LLM-based editing with Emacs, either more complicated because the interactions are more complicated, or because they just require a bit more complicated types of processing.
 The first is a demo of asking an LLM to improve text. The ellama package already does this, but what this adds is the ability to see a diff, ask for further changes (in context of the previous changes) and accept the diff.
 My goal is to produce a bunch of these demos and figure out the necessary library functions to do these things in a clean, consistent, and useful way. Perhaps I'd add them to the `llm` package, perhaps it might require a new package. In emacs-devel@ I wrote up details, including code pointers and a list of interesting questions I'm thinking about. I'm posting this here as well because I think there's interest on what I'm demoing, and I'd appreciate feedback on it, especially from a user perspective.

 Hi I am implementing a small parser to learn type level (programming) Haskell.
 I have the following data types for:
 data Exp = Num Int | Plus Exp Exp
 data SExp = Atom Type | L [SExp]
 And I want a function that does the following:
 parse :: SExp -> Exp 
 parse (Atom s) = if typeOf s == Int then Num s else _
 I understand the existing of function typeOf. But is there a way to do this equality without passing an actual value (i.e. typeOf s == typeOf 1 or typeOf s == typeOf 'c'). Things that come to mind, but don't know how to implement, is to use type families since one can they map types to types. Apologies in advance for any nonsensical things on this post.

 What to should i add/configure to be able to examine values of variables/functions when running my scripts?
 Now when something goes wrong, i add lots of print statements... Obviously it's not right. I tried pdb, set_trace - it's better than print. But is there a better way?
 To run my scripts i simply do M-x run python and enter what i want to run. (i also use python-mls)

 At first, I used the following code:
 (set-fontset-font "fontset-startup" 'latin (font-spec :family "Noto Sans Mono" :size 24))
 I start Emacs by typing Emacs in the terminal, and it worked fine.
 But when I run emacs --daemon, it gives me the following error:
 error: Fontset ‘fontset-startup’ does not exist
 So I tried to set fonset-default. but strangely, the fonts I set for latin are always overwritten (whereas the fonts I set for han don't have this problem).
 I know I can set fonts using set-face-attribute etc, but they can't set multiple fonts like fontset can. So I decided to come to Reddit to try and ask for help after I couldn't find a solution that worked for me in Google.
 Also attached is my runtime environment:
  
KDE Plasma 5.27.10 with wayland(kwin)
 Emacs 29.1
  
Remind me if you need more information from me!

 I know org-fold has all sorts of context exposure capability and settings but I can't seem to get any behavior like this from looking at the documentation. I want simple, automatic behavior. Yes, it is okay if it just expands all levels drawers, etc. that are hidden based on movement of point.
 Even better would be if Org mode were made compatible with reveal.el. Then one could simply enable the global version of that minor mode and have this behavior in all of your org files, as exists now for other outlining modes.

 Writing it down this way makes it sound fancy and meta, but it's a simple, almost obvious, connection really, maybe I'm not using the right words. I also tried doing a longer exposition on this here (there I also show how React, SwiftUI and Flutter have the same gene).

Tortuous Repository of Labyrinthine Lucubration
This isn't advocacy--it's an attempt to describe what my Zettelkasten has become so far, or rather, what it can and cannot do. It seems impervious to market forces and cannot interact with them. It wants to negate virtually every front-page headline in the paper of record and other carefully edited organs of filtered pablum. Other than that, there is no interaction. Attempts to optimize it only make it worse and more convoluted than otherwise. I wouldn't call it a wellspring of ideas--more like a trapped aquifer.
This seems to have happened after switching ID formats at least twice and adding an alphabetic backlink index. Any effort to describe it is at least as long as the Zettelkasten itself.]]></summary>

 It gives me an error message (which has some information, before I was getting Error in ~/.gnus: ) which was much less helpful. The error is:
 Error in ~/.gnus: smtpmail-smtp-server In my .gnus file, it's exactly as provided by my email provider. My .gnus is as follows:

 Does anyone know what's going on with it? I've been busting some sweat over it for the past 3 hours |:
 Regards.
 Edit: I've been able to get the rmail client in Emacs (M-x mail) to send mail but am having trouble configuring the .gnus file.
 Second edit: I've reached a solution. I ended up simplifying my .gnu file to only contain my mail address, name, smtp default server, and the port.

 Every few years I have the need to parse XML, I find that the top results on Google when I search for Haskell libraries to deal with XML are packages that have not been updated in a while, and the situation never improves.
 This is hard, so I'm not surprised that some authors have given up on updating their libraries. But XML is still widely used.
 I would not mind it if there was some coordinated effort towards cleaning and updating of XML libraries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just shared on an old post how you can "coordinate" use-package and package-selected-packages so that you may, for example, use package-autoremove.
 That post is 3 years old, so posing also as a new entry in case it's useful to anybody (and to gather feedback):
 This creates a new keyword extension for use-package, :mark-selected t:
 ``emacs-lisp ;;;; use-package :mark-selected ;; Make it possible to kinda managepackage-selected-packages' from ;; use-package by adding `:mark-selected' as a keyword.. (require 'use-package) (defun use-package-normalize/:mark-selected (_name keyword args) (use-package-only-one (symbol-name keyword) args #'(lambda (_label arg) (or arg nil))))
 (defun use-package-handler/:mark-selected (name _keyword arg rest state) (let ((body (use-package-process-keywords name rest state))) (if arg (package--update-selected-packages `(,name) '())) body))
 (add-to-list 'use-package-keywords :mark-selected t) ```
 You can then do:
 emacs-lisp (use-package no-littering :mark-selected t :config (no-littering-theme-backups) (setq custom-file (no-littering-expand-etc-file-name "custom.el"))) 
 And your package-selected-packages will have this package!

 I noticed that (almost) all "special" modes derive from special-mode which provide such a key-bind among others.
 So I defined a minor mode to reuse these keybinds in read-only-mode:
 https://gitlab.com/Thaodan/emacs.d-lisp/-/blob/master/simple-ext.el?ref_type=heads#L14
 The mode can be activated similar to other minor modes like shown below (when using use-package).
  (use-package read-only :init (require 'simple-ext) :hook ((read-only-mode . special-keymap-mode))) 
 The mode made is much more convenient for me to work with files which are read-only.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this is the wrong place for this. There is no beorg subreddit, and I can only image that this is the only place on reddit where there would be a decent number of beorg users.
 I have had some issues on beorg when it comes to connecting to my NAS server via WebDAV so I can sync with my .org files on there. No matter what I do, it seems, I get the following error message:
 'Sync could not be completed. A list of your files couldn't be downloaded from your server. Check that your WebDAV server URL, username and password are correct.'
 I have entered the URL, username, and password correctly, as I have been able to connect using other devices and services. I am confident this is not the issue.
 Some of the (log-contents) mention an SSL error, so I thought the issue might be with the certificate. But since I have managed to use WebDAV with other devices and services, and since I have tried logging in while toggling the 'Allow untrusted certificate', I am not so sure it is a certificate issue.
 I have tried every kind of URL, folder path, and I just can't understand why it isn't working. The settings on my NAS don't seem to be the issue either. I have gone over them, and, as mentioned, managed to connect with many other devices and services.
 My usual URL is something like this:
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav
 I have also tried the following:
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav/[path to my .org folder]
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/dav
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/dav/[path to my .org folder]
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me:5006
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me:5005
 I have tried using http and smb as well. I have also tried using NAS quick connect and using the external IP address of the NAS. Port-forwarding is correctly configured on my router.
 I just can't hack it.
 Any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated! Thanks!

 The readme is easy enough to follow, but the existence of more recent repos for individual submodules has me second guessing myself. The following repos have been updated more recently than rougier/nano-emacs: 
  
 rougier/nano-modeline
 rougier/nano-agenda
 rougier/nano-vertico
  
This leaves me wondering, for example, whether I should be using nano-modeline.el from rougier/nano-emacs (last updated three years ago), or from the rougier/nano-modeline (last updated yesterday) . 
 ​
 For those that use nano-emacs, what is the approach you recommend?

 I'm a python programmer coming from research background. I fell in love with programming and functional programming always had this allure for me. I have read quite a bit on functional programming, Bartoz Milewskis "Category theory for programmers" and doing the haskell.mooc.fi
 To learn the things actually, I started writing a simplified version of card game Dominion with python and trying to use pseudo-Haskell approach. Why? I'm more fluent in python for now (especially IO) and a game like Dominion is inherently stateful so I thought this would be a good practice.
 I have record (dataclass in python) called playerState which contains deck, hand, discarcd_pile i.e. things that model individual player. For now, I have a gameState that contains a list of playerStates and central_supply that is global for all players.
 All card effects are pure, often partial functions effect::playerState, someArg->playerState. For example draw::playerState -> num_cards -> playerState. Here is an example of a card that draws one card and gains one card: gainDraw = Card( name="Gain Victory point and draw 1 card", card_type="Action", cost=2, effects=[gain victoryCard, draw 1], ). Now the "cool part" is that I have a function play_card:: playerState -> Card -> playerState that simply composes all effects of a card to one single composite function and applies it to playerState. Playing one card is then one elegant transition from state1 to state2 with no intermediary assigments etc. So far so good.
 Now the problem: some card effects modify also the global gameState and not just fields in playerState. Essentially I have globalState containing localStates. What is a common solution in Haskell or in functional paradigm in general to handle nested states? A whole different architecture, lifting types? You can be harsh and say that my domain(ion, sorry had to) modeling is all wrong.

 Personally, huge pre-configured solutions (like lazyvim or spacemacs) are too complicated for me. As a beginner, I want to do things at a relatively raw level, which is more comfortable because I don't feel blindly accepting things where I often confuse different parts and keep doing things the wrong way, and that blindness in my experience often prevents me from using a tool in the most efficient way (plus spacemacs' startup time is too long :( on my already not so powerful computer).
 So I liked it once I found the repo of Ashton. I tried the simplest version from the repository (called "early-init.el") and followed its comments carefully. Useful things I found in this file include
  
how to install packages
 how to change the background colour (I didn't do though)
 Others like font face where the repository owner left it blank, but the related function names are there to guide me.
  
​
 --------
 Totally unrelated, the Emacs plugins have a very different flavour compared to their counterparts in Neovim/vim. They are structured quite differently. This is how I feel as someone who has tried to learn Vim for a while. (The latter's approach requires a degree of understanding of "the editor itself" such text object)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, I'm experimenting more with Org-roam and am trying to figure out some of the best practices before committing too much on one path. Currently, I've set up a few bigger .org files such as emacs and orgmode that link to each other, but in each I have a bunch of useful links. I've seen some tutorials suggesting that links and thoughts should be in very small individual .org files, but that seems convoluted and time-consuming. 
 Secondly, I'm wondering how much info I really want to add from areas that might not be so related. Do I really want to mesh together my cooking knowledge base with my computer focused information pools? Will things get convoluted down the line?
 I've been having a little trouble finding actual workflows. A lot of tutorials on setting things up, but I'd like to see more of Org-roam in action. I think I'm missing some of the bigger picture philosophy in relation to org-mode.
 How do you all use it? Do you have any useful media I can read or watch?
 Thanks for your time!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a function that I use inside of a larger function to list all org-roam notes with the "Project" tag. These functions are defined in a .el file that is called from my init.el file. For some reason, when I eval the defun blocks in that file, the function fails to recognize the argument I pass to it ("tagname"), but when I copy the code into my scratch buffer and evaluate it there, it suddenly works. I am also able to add the line (defvar tagline "Project") and it works in that case as well.
 (defun cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag (tagname) (lambda (node) (member tagname (org-roam-node-tags node)))) (defun cj/org-roam-find-project () (interactive) ;; Select file to open, creating if necessary (org-roam-node-find nil nil (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag "Project") nil :templates '(("p" "project" plain "* Goal\n\n%?\n\n* Inbox\n\n** TODO Add initial tasks\n\n" :if-new (file+head "%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${slug}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n#+category: ${title}\n#+filetags: Project") :unnarrowed t)))) 
 Essentially, the issue I'm having is I start emacs/load my init file, these functions are defined, and I run cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag. I get the error (void-variable tagname), which seems to come from the lambda function. At this point, if I run (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag "Project"), it evaluates to (lambda (node) (member tagname (progn (or ... ...) (aref node 16)))), which I can then fix be either copying the (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag) function to the scratch buffer and evaluating it there, or evaluating (defvar tagname "Project"). 
 This code is taken almost exclusively from system crafters, and I don't really understand the lambda function and what it does. As far as I can tell this seems to be some sort of scoping issue, but since I'm directly calling the function with "Project" as an argument, I don't see why I'm getting the "void-variable" error. 
 I'm a little lost with this issue, and I'd appreciate any help. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, is it possible to use emacs-jupyter with Databricks?
 A typical workflow for me involves writing a conversational-style org file in Emacs as I puzzle through how to get the data I need out of Databricks tables in an accompanying browser window:
  
Issue Spark SQL query in browser window.
 Download result set as CSV.
 Open CSV file in Emacs.
 Save the entire file contents to the kill ring.
 Paste it into my org file.
 Select the table and run org-table-create-or-convert-from-region (C-c |).
  
I could streamline steps 3-6 with a homebrew command, but I am aching to do this kind of exploration org-babel style, just pressing C-c C-c to run the query and seeing the results right there in the org file.
 The emacs-jupyter Github page mentions a command jupyter-connect-repl which connects to an existing kernel, which seems to be what I'd need, if, as I suppose, a notebook I run on the Databricks web interface is backed by a kernel. (Although I don't know for sure; introductory-level descriptions of the various components seems to be pretty scarce.) The Github page links to something called a kernel's connection file, a JSON file with fields like control_port, shell_port, etc, which I would need to supply. I've scoured the Databricks notebook interface and can't find a file like this offered anywhere. There is a tab called "Partner Connect" that offers "connection files" for many Databricks partner companies, but the ones I'm able to access don't contain the information emacs-jupyter seems to want. Some aren't even JSON.
 So, yeah. Any advice?

 I haven't come up with a definitive proof but on the surface level identity laws seems to hold. I'm not so sure about composition but my tests (albeit a small set) gave me affirmative results. 
 I get a sensible free implementation for fmap. However i failed to get a free implementation for join and apply which makes me suspicious that the composition law indeed does not hold. Instead of banging my head against the compiler i wanted to ask you where exactly the problem is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For reference, I've been using emacs since about 1987. I went through an XEmacs "phase", then returned to GNU Emacs. In all this time, I am very aware of the fact that I've never used any significant part of its power.
 Around the release of 29.1 with tree-sitter, I chose to wholly re-write my config. I tossed almost everything I had, and pulled things back in piece-wise as I found I needed them. I also took the opportunity to add in a few things I had always heard great enthusiasm for (counsel, ivy, company, swiper to name a few).
 And now... I'm barely using any of the new stuff. Maybe I tried to add too much too quickly? How do others integrate all these truly useful packages into your daily flow?

 It'd have to be language sensitive. For example 'when' and 'let' have one arg before the body but 'save-excursion' has none. Wondering if anything already exists before I start trying to write it myself.

 This issue only persists on mituharu emacs macport.
 Any insights in to this is highly appreciated.

 I need to be able to run python script with M-x function (so i can bind it to hotkey). So far i have this:
 (defun my/mysimplefunction () (interactive) (insert (shell-command-to-string "python mysimplefunction.py"))) 
 I have 2 problems with it:
 1, how to set default directory for script, or absolute path? Cause right now script works only if current buffer is in same directory as
 2, i don't need function output to be inserted in current buffer (it's script without output). Now it ouputs (error, etc) to current buffer. (It can ouput to "*messages", but it's not necessary)
 Update: Made it work with
 (defun my/mysimplefunction () (interactive) (shell-command-to-string "python /AbsolutePath/mysimplefunction.py")) 
 Won't delete the thread in case it will be helpful to someone with same question in future.

 Sometimes I want to list the whole agenda, but other times I want to filter it so it only shows the agenda items that is in one org file.
 F.ex. "show me my agenda but only include items from work.org"
 then after work I want "show me my agenda but only include items from parties.org"
 Is this possible without too much fuzzing about or do I need to tag everything f.ex.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have written a test program that uses--parent-id option to embed an Emacs session, and noticed that it starts with a set size, but does not resize to match changes to the parent window size.
 The problem can be seen here - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17982831/emacs-embedded-in-a-qt-application
 Can it detect some changes to the parent window and user set-frame-size to adjust itself to match? Or perhaps set scroll bars if the parent size shrinks below some preset levels?
 I just noticed that the command-line-args variable removes some of the command line arguments after they've been processed.
 Is there some way of retaining the original list? The --parent-id parameter seems to be removed after it has been processed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I started Haskell this week, and I'm completely in love. Compared to my previous languages (Python, Java, C++) Haskell is just utterly beautiful. I can't get enough of it.
 I'm finding the language difficult at times. Not because the language itself is difficult - it isn't - but for a few other reasons:
 1) Learning resources are far more limited than for other languages. Resources for learning on mobile, in particular, seem almost non-existent. Does anyone have any they'd recommend?
 2) When my code doesn't work, I find Haskell's error messages very hard to interpret. Does this get easier?
 3) Input/output seems trickier than elsewhere. Anyone have anything I can read that might make them click? I've been mainly solving Codewars problems so I can bypass my input/output block.

 This is my entire config file. I am on emacs version 29.1
 ​
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t) (package-install 'cape) (package-install 'corfu) (require 'cape) (setq cape-dabbrev-min-length 3) (dolist (backend '(cape-dabbrev cape-elisp-symbol cape-file)) (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions backend)) (require 'corfu) (global-corfu-mode 1) (setq tab-always-indent 'complete) (custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.

 I call (debug-on-entry #'cape-file) in ielm and then press TAB with my cursor over a string that is a prefix for a valid file name. I enter the debugger so I know cape-file is being called but it ends up returning nil. When I then press M-x and call cape-file interactively it also brings up the debugger but this time it completes the filename accurately. If anyone has any idea what's going on or knows how to fix this I would be very appreciative.

So far I'm largely filling it with ideas I've been turning over in my mind for a while rather than the product of new reading. I've come to the conclusion that these ideas should be sat on for a while before they turn into permanent notes and so a zettelkasten would be unsuitable for learning a new field or subfield, which would be better served by a sort of lab manual or similar (not being an academic, I don't particularly need to preserve citations). Like an accounting system that uses a memorandum sheet, a journal, and then a ledger, with the zettelkasten being analogous to the last.
I got into this from Scheper's book, but I'm not a purist and I found his approach a little too dogmatic. But what I don't recall from his book or Luhmann's zettelkasten is recording the date each card was written. I don't know if that information is useful, but I've been including it on each card.]]></summary>

I just could process it right away. On the flip side, I can't recommend to read the book if you already read another of the popular books on habit, because the content was almost identical. This is one of the most critiques of the one-star-ratings: "Read X instead, same content but better". But I can't come up with a book that does what the current state of the collective knowledge requires: A book that actually makes an effort to give a complete picture. This is the gap I want to fill.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a medical student. I currently use org mode for managing a task list and have quite enjoyed using it together with orgzly, termux running Emacs and beorg. I would really like to use org-roam for maintaining my notes in medicine however I find that there to be a few parts of my workflow that are stopping me from just using Emacs and orgmode:
  
When I go to placement, I often like to just use the computers that are there. These hospital computers as you can imagine are locked pretty securely and so its impractical for me to setup Emacs on these computers or run anything from a USB. I have previously used something web based like notion.so but the experience was far from satisfactory.
 I unfortunately fell into the trap of buying an iPad for medical school and I want to make the most use of it. I will ocassionally bring this to placement and would like to be also take notes on my iPad.
 I do often have to look or reference my notes while on my phone. So quick offline access to my notes synced through syncthing is ideal.
  
I am currently considering using obsidian.md which uses markdown files. I can then sync these files with my phone and iPad and use the obsidian apps on either device. On my own computer I am thinking of using Emacs with https://github.com/licht1stein/obsidian.el. On computers at placement I am considering having my org files in a private repo on gitlab or github and then using the built in text editor on thos platforms.
 My question therefore is: is there a better alternative for my workflow/use-case that mainly uses org mode files as opposed to using obsidian?
 EDIT: I am open to also using pandoc to convert org and md files as long as the process can be somewhat automated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Haskell's arguably most important and interesting features is lazy evaluation.
 As a novice / intermediate (I started learning Haskell about a year ago and am really enjoying it!), I still can't explain the advantages of lazy evaluation in real world applications. 
 After a bit of duckduckgoing, the first benefit that is often mentioned is the ability to create infinite data structures. While that is certainly interesting and fun to work with, it feels somewhat gimmicky to me. As mentioned, I am a novice, so I wonder, are infinite data structures a feature you regularly use in real world applications, and are they important in these applications? By that I mean that they are clearly better to use in that position than code without the infinite data structure?
 Another benefit that is often mentioned is the possibility to define control structures in normal code. To my understanding, this is the case for many monad combinators such as when or replicateM, and so on. Again I wonder how relevant this is in real applications, as most programming languages suffice with a few basic control structures.
 Furthermore, it seems that the monadic control structures still require the do notation to be useful, which is not defined in normal code, and when defining control structures for a new type class (such as arrows), new syntax defined outside of normal code is still required, as arrows seem to have their own special variant of do notation.
 Finally, there seems to be a performance trade off with haskells lazy evaluation, as lazy evaluation inherently has overhead, but might avoid unnecessary calculations. I wonder if these unnecessary calculations could not be avoided by better programming?
 All in all, how useful is haskells lazy evaluation, and is it a feature that should be adopted by other (new) programming languages? Or maybe is that a question that is still being researched / explored?

 I have just switched doing my (hobbyist) Haskell dev on VSCode on Windows to VSCode on Windows / WSL:Ubuntu 20.04. After a full compile on both and doing a minor change I am seeing a 20X speed improvement in WSL vs running all the same cabal build under plain old Windows. This speed improvement is predictably cascading through to the tooling (HLS starting and making significant code changes, running GHCID) . 
 It feels like all the tooling has snapped to life with the switch to WSL.
 Needless to say I'll be sticking with WSL but I'm curious if this is a common experience for Windows users or if I'm an outlier on this one?

For some reason, typescript-ts-mode and tsx-ts-mode are not correctly highlighting function calls. Typescript-mode does correctly highlight them, but it doesn't parse TSX, so I was going to use tsx-ts-mode for .tsx and typescript-mode for .ts. I installed the grammar with treesit-install-language-grammar and added it to the auto-mode-alist with (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.tsx\\'" . tsx-ts-mode)), but this is what my syntax highlighting looks like:
 tsx-ts-mode: no function call highlighting
 typescript-mode: no jsx highlighting
 If anyone has encountered and fixed this problem I would greatly appreciate you telling me how you fixed it. Also, for some reason, tsx files force me to have 2 space indentation despite typescript-indent-level and tab-width both being 4. Any advice for how to fix this would also be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Friends of Haskell,
 It is our pleasure to announce that ZuriHac 2024 will take place Saturday 8 June - Monday 10 June 2024 as a physical event at the Rapperswil-Jona campus of the OST Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences.
 The focus of ZuriHac is being a community event and hackathon, but we will also have some exciting keynotes from Ningning Xie, Alex McLean, Ivan Perez and Mary Sheeran. In addition to that, there will be some more hands-on content: Well-Typed will host a workshop, Jesper Cockx will host an Agda track and Manuel Bärenz will host an FRP Track.
 We also welcome beginners or people unfamiliar to Haskell who are curious to learn more. Eliane Schmidli will teach a beginners workshop, and there will be many mentors from the Haskell Community happy to answer all your questions.
 Two days prior to ZuriHac, the Haskell Foundation and OST will organize a co-located 2-day Haskell Infrastructure Workshop. More details about that will be announced soon.
 You can find more information about the event and register at https://zurihac.info.
 The event is free for participants. This is only possible with the help of our generous supporters, who are currently:
  
The Haskell Foundation
 Jane Street
 OST Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences
 Tweag
 Well-Typed
  
In case you would like to support ZuriHac, please get in touch with us.
 We hope to see you there! The Zurich Friends of Haskell

 the comment says that we need to run the command in the main directory [duckling-0.2.0.0 for me]. I did that but it didn't help.

 Any line in a python file with a "red" eglot error in flycheck now gets greyed out, which to me is completely counterproductive to actually fixing the errors, since the code just gets harder to read. I've done some googling and can't find anything useful. Does anyone know what package might be causing this, and where I can switch it off? Thanks!

check/warn/error on line length
 align closing brackets/parens to the indentation of the opening bracket/paren
 align series of whatever (params mostly I suppose) to the indentation of the first one
 mirror spaces around closing brackets/parens to the opening. eg. if ( thing) becomes if ( thing )
 etc. basically providing localized syntax consistency rather than global
  
If nothing like this exists, would anyone be interested in it?

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
Knowledge work in public.
I'm exploring a method of changing the format of all my links so I can interact with software that uses the literal file name in the link.
I'm exploring how I'm using the YAML frontmatter. This is a part of the file that could be a rich source of knowledge.
Upping my writing chops. LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively
Things I'm reading:
Tucci, Stanley. Taste: my life through food. 2021.
Gratz, Alan. Refugee. 2017.
Music I'm listening to:
Grandbrothers
Jessy J - Latin Saxophone
Halie Loren
Weathertunes
Stats
In my opinion, the generated numbers do not hold any specific meaning. They are just fun to create using my ZK's dataset. Feel free to interpret them however you wish. As Homer Simpson once said, "You can come up with statistics to prove anything. 40% of all people know that."

The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm currently writing a bytecode interpreter for a programming language in Haskell. I've written most of it so far but the main problem is that the actually execution of a program is very slow, roughly 10x slower than Python. When profiling the execution of the program, I noticed that most of the time is being spent simply getting the next byte or incrementing the instruction pointer. These operations are simply changing an Int in a StateT monad. Is Haskell simply the wrong language for writing a backend VM or are there optimizations that can be done to improve the performance. I should mention that I'm already running with -O2. Thanks
 edit - added code:
 I'm adding what I hope is relevant parts of the code, but if I'm omitting something important, please let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to contribute my little story. I started using Emacs with the Spacemacs distro (great distro!). I used it for a year and realized that the amount of things to learn is much greater. I learned Vim keybindings, Spacemacs keybindings, modal editing. I also learned the concepts of Emacs, Org Mode, Magit. I realized that some things don't happen so quickly, and I also started to get tired of modal editing and only using the keyboard to perform actions. So, I decided to try vanilla Emacs. I noticed that the contents of the main menu, the button menu and the modeline change according to the position of the pointer, that is, the GUI presents the options in a contextual way. Now I can work effectively using the keyboard and mouse and receiving feedback from the interface regarding commands and key combinations that I always forget. And finally, I gave up on maintaining a configuration file (for now), I learned to use 'customize'. I'm really amazed at what you can do with absolutely no configuration initially! Some advice for beginners (I still am): - Enable CUA mode at the very beginning and migrate to default over time - Learn the concepts (Emacs is a platform!) - Learn how GUI behaves - Learn the key combinations - Learn Org Mode (this is f****** awesome!) - Have a good time!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy! I am a 4th year university student who has some spare time (I have to take an extra year) to learn tools. For context, right now I use kitty+tmux and neovim to do most of my note taking and general linux stuff. This includes compiling and writing in LaTeX, script writing, etc.
 For context: I've used emacs in the past and like emacsclient + the other useful tools emacs has to offer out of the box, but it hasn't seemed really sensible to me. DistroTube recently came out with his series on building a sensible config from scratch which I've played with for a bit, but I don't want to fully commit if what I want isn't possible.
 What I am looking for: - ability to act as a terminal - pdf viewing with latex editing side by side - being able to navigate to other workspaces to view pdfs and navigate through them with vim-like binds - extensible (which emacs is) - ability to integrate zettelkasten with a pdf open in another pane/split within the same program
 The general idea I want is it do everything I need to do school/productivity wise within emacs, and nothing else. My current setup works, but I like seeing what else is out there. Let me know how doable this would be.
 Please go easy on me I know there's probably a post like this on here once a week. :')

 Is there an API for doing this with some examples for doing this? Currently I use EXWM and regular GUI program windows do show up and I can use them normally, but I need something native to Emacs and not based on XCB or other windowing modes used by Emacs programs.
 I suspect that Xwidgets (GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual) and An Emacs Dynamic Module for WebKit may be working along such lines but I need simple examples that are not so web-focused.
 I am not even sure whether my concept of forms in GUI Apps conform to what Emacs calls native widgets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I write Rust using eglot and rustic and it works great! I can jump to the definition of an identifier with xref-find-definitions, and I can see the type of the binding with eldoc or with inlays.
 However, I don't know how to quickly jump to the type of an identifier?
 Rust uses type inference a lot, so the concrete type is often not spelled out in the source code. This means that I don't have the type to use as a starting point. An example:
 rust let foo = build_me_a_foo(); 
 Here I would like to be able to jump to the Foo type which build_me_a_foo presumably returns. Today I do this by jumping to the definition of build_me_a_foo and then jump further from the function signature.
 Reading the Emacs manual, I see that I could use C-u M-. to get a prompt for the identifier to jump to. The very large list presented to me does contain what I need, but I need to spell it out based on what eldoc showed me in the mode line.
 Has anybody written the code to look up the type and then feed it directly into C-u M-.?

 I have a question regarding ghc bootstrapping. It used to be the case that you could build an unregistered ghc for a new platform by compiling to .hc files. Copying the build dist over to the new platform and then using a g compiler to build them.
 I am wanting to port ghc to a platform with a c compiler, but no gcc or llvm port. This seems like the best option if it’s still working!
 Anyone know anything helpful?
 Edit: I realise that Hadrian makes this hard…. I’d need a cross compiler to create the build program on the target system….
 Edit 2: I think Hadrian would have to be adapted to generate hc files and makes files. But in all seriousness, isn’t this a good idea? It’s a bit of a barrier porting ghc to new platforms if the bootstrap process involved digging up ghc 6 and working up to 9.
 Thanks!

 I'm making fun in my life implementing Parser (and it's really fun), but i would like to ask following.
 i have Parser a :: Parser String -> Either String (a, String)
 let's say i have a list of parsers ps = [p1, p2, p3 ...]
 How can i push input string through all of them, and i'm looking for 2 solutions:
 Alternative (so we get first successful result)
 Chain (so i apply them one by one and output from p1 is input for p2), and its successful only if all of them are worked.
 I think this is pretty simply, but my brains are old, i have 39' temperature and need to solve it to feel better.
 Here is gh, code is located in lib/Parseme.hs

Anyway, I thought I’d take the opportunity to discuss some of
GHC’s inner workings and how they explain some of the features of
linear types in Haskell. We’ll be discussing a frequently asked
question: why can’t Ur be a newtype? And some new questions

GHC’s frontend part 1: typechecking

For now I'm using only parent-child dependencies; i.e. I've set org-enforce-todo-dependencies to t so that attempting to move a task to a DONE state is blocked if the task in question has child tasks that have not yet been marked as DONE. And I have that working fine...
 ... but only if I to try to mark the task as DONE using C-c C-t (which runs (org-todo &optional ARG) ).
 But if instead I try to mark the task as DONE using S-<right> (which runs (org-shiftright &optional ARG) which will in turn, "on a headline, switch to the next TODO keyword" then the task in question gets switched to the next keyword, including DONE if that's next in the sequence, regardless of any children still being not DONE. In other words, it looks like the process triggered by S-<right> ignores the value of org-enforce-todo-dependencies.
 Is that how it's supposed to work?

I've seen a couple videos about the power of emacs org mode and I'm very interested in using it myself. My current setup is 1 laptop running windows 11, a boox note air 2+ running android, and a iphone running iOS. For me, I would like to use my e-ink tablet to markup lecture slides, take notes etc, and have it sync to all my devices. Would syncthing be good for this purpose? Accessing emacs from my phone would be a big plus but I've heard that this is easier on an android phone. 
 As of now I have no experience programming (planning to learn python in my free time) and don't really know what a text editor is or really what emacs is as a whole. 
 I would also love to use emacs org mode for: 
 -planner 
 - TODO lists 
 Any help on how to go out this would be greatly appreciated.

 I tried to change the style with c-set-style but I haven't found the one I was looking for, which is something like this.
 void stack_push (int val, stack* s) { element* e = _make_element(val); if (!e) return; e->next = s->head; s->head = e; }; 
 If you know a style that looks like that, or the main Elisp commands to get it looking like this, let me know.
 ​
 I'm new to Emacs (been using it for less than 3months) and I haven't touched Elisp that much (only for setting up some packages and configuration).
 Thanks !

So I'm finally posting with what I hope is useful for someone else, as it has been for me; a formalised system for organising a Zettelkasten, that takes a very critical look at categorisation, folders and tags. The driving concern being reducing "cognitive friction" when creating and writing notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, Exactly as it says in the title, running the function on an org latex fragment results in the error. I run Emacs on Wsl 2 on Windows 11, compiled from from source with pgtk. I found a post from last week that solves this issue by compiling emacs using the default method. However, compiling with pgtk was the only working solution I had found to a problem of blurry text in emacs. 
 Does anyone have a solution for this? Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just wanted to share a delightful moment I had today. I'm currently working on a NMEA-based protocol for some microcontroller stuff. NMEA uses a simple format:
 $<message>*<checksum>\r\n 
 And in my tests I need to write the message, and then compute the checksum over message. A simple byte-wise or. There are websites for this, or I could write a script - but that always means leaving emacs, copy-and-pasting around.
 But this is an extensible editor! This snippet does it for the marked region and inserts at point.
  (defun deets/nmea-checksum () (interactive) (let ((checksum (format "%02X" (apply 'logxor (mapcar (lambda (c) c) (buffer-substring (mark) (point))))))) (save-excursion (insert (format "*%s\\r\\n" checksum))))) 
 There's some obvious extensions like ignoring a leading $, ensuring I'm always appending at the end, and possibly even replacing an already existing checksum with the new one. But even in this most basic, cost-me-5-minutes-to-build version it's a productivity boost and just plain joy for me :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know there are problems with Emacs (29.1) and the current version of GnuPG (2.4.X), causing Emacs to hang indefinitely when trying to access GnuPG tools (like saving an encrypted file). 
 Until now, the only workaround was to downgrade GnuPG (and by the way, this script fails as well). And since Homebrew doesn't have 2.4.0 version, I went all the way down to 2.2, however, the problem persists and I can't save encrypted files from Emacs. 
 I've tried on two M1 machines (both with macOS 14.2.1) and I get the same behavior. Since (fset 'epg-wait-for-status 'ignore) is dangerous and can corrupt your file, what else can I try?

 This morning, I wanted to make a new org-roam node so I SPC-m-f (org-roam-node-find) and enter the name of the new node: Archiving in Org Mode. Unfortunately, there is already a node named OrgMode Archiving and that's what was selected. Here is my config:
  (use-package orderless :config (setq completion-styles '(orderless basic) completion-category-defaults nil completion-category-overrides '((file (styles partial-completion))))) 
 Orderless finding that node would have been fine if I had a way of canceling its choice and telling it to use what I typed instead. Usual cancel keys ESC or C-g didn't do the job.
 ​
 Solved: Thanks everyone. The completion was Vertico. I had set M-k as previous in Vertico, and that was indeed what was needed- select what I typed and not the entry Vertico found. I'm a simple man, up arrow is easier for me to remember.

 GNU ELPA stands for "Emacs Lisp Package Archive", which is a repository of packages created by the GNU Emacs community. In order to submit a package to the GNU ELPA repository, a package must be licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and require a copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to be included in core Emacs. NonGNU ELPA allows for packages to be included without the copyright assignment, and while it does not go into core Emacs, it is still an official and popular archive for Emacs Lisp packages.
 GNU ELPA and NonGNU ELPA are both enabled by default but since MELPA is an unofficial archive it isn't and requires you to manually install it. Despite it being an unofficial archive, MELPA is still managed by the Emacs Lisp Package Archive Team, and it has a strict screening policy, so only high-quality packages that meet the licensing requirements can be included.

The tab-bar renders halfway like this, and the bottom half flickers in and out. It only happens when I have an internal-border-width set on the frame (currently via the spacious-padding package).

 edit: I installed the non-pgtk version to test, and I see that the tabs are right at the top of the frame in that version, so maybe a pgtk bug with tab-bar positioning?

 I used to consider it as non-pure because it reads a hidden state C1 , which is not a parameter of this method.
 But someClass.someMethod(v1, v2) is a method. The real function in terms of FP should be something like someMethod(someClassAndItsImmutableProperties, v1, v2) , then C1 is part of the parameter.
 So someClass.someMethod(v1, v2) is a pure function. Is my understanding correct?

 org-timeblock
 https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock
 Emacs package that provides interactive multiple-day timeblock view for orgmode tasks.
 Also, might be used as a tool for timeblocking productivity technique.
 Changes
  
Added mark commands (mark-block, unmark-block, mark-by-regexp) for timeblocks that can be used to reschedule multiple tasks at once
 Replaced ts.el with built-in time API
 Replaced org-ql with own searching and caching functions
 dom.el is now used instead of regexps to fetch and change SVG data (much cleaner code)
 Deadline timestamps are now treated as it should be, not as events
 Now, each active timestamp in a heading body is displayed (as event), not only the first one
 Added custom variable org-timeblock-files
 Other minor bug fixes and improvements 8)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a quick question about refiling, if anyone has any insights!
 I'd really like to add properties (as if a capture) to an item as I refile. Let's say I quickly jotted down in beorg "True Grit" and when I'm refiling I want to add that to my movie list but also add properties like TODO state and then a property drawer with things like the GENRE, RELEASE, RATING etc. etc. Is that possible at all to make it a one step process instead of a two step process (refile and then add property template). Or is best to just re-enter the information with a capture and then delete the original heading?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have encountered a strange issue when using Emacs to edit LaTeX files.
 When I type certain keywords, such as \begin or \section, they are turned into unicode symbols. Please see the screenshot for examples.
 This behaviour could have been fine, except that they don't seem to function. For instance, the "section" symbol does not create a section in the document.
 It looks like it might have something to do with the input method for TeX, since I can find the symbols as "translations" of the keywords when I look there. Please see screenshot.
 I don't encounter this problem when using emacs -Q but I also cannot find a LaTeX related culprit in my config, so I'm at a loss. I experience the behaviour both on my personal Linux computer and on my work Mac.
 Does anyone know what might cause this behaviour and how I can disable it?
 In case you think there might be something in my config and want to help me out by having a look, it's available here.
 EDIT:
 Thank you for the help! Turns out it was related to corfu's autocomplete. Setting corfu-auto to nil resolved the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some may remember me asking about migrating my TiddlyWiki instances to org a while back. I'm now actively working on that conversion, starting with the two relatively small instances. Once I have those done and have learned from my many anticipated mistakes, I'll tackle the journal for my day-job.
 My question is this, and it's not necessarily TW-centric: for those of you with comparable situations, do you use one larger (centralized) org file, or one master file that mostly contains overview/contents and links to a number of smaller files, one per topic?
 I'll give an example: one my my TW instances is for my FOSS projects (mostly modules, mostly for Perl at this point). I have about 17 separate topics in it, each one ranging from 5-6 lines of text to the largest being about a full page by itself. Would you folks be more inclined to have a single file (a la the original TiddlyWiki), or break each topic into its own sub-file?
 I realize that org is going to be capable of jumping around a large file as easily as it can jump between files, at least that's the impression I've gotten. I guess I'm interested in what people find works best for them?

 Is there a way to use evil AND emacs keybindings.
 If there isn't a way, is there a way to do things like move to the first character of a line, format (like you do in vim by selecting and pressing "=")?
 Edit: I have only followed the basic emacs tutorial and found a few useful keys here and there. I've been using it for a week and I think I'm going to stay.

I really like this as a writing environment and use it whenever I can get away with it. 
 The document class is Koma-script scrartcl that I have set up an export for. I have no math or images here, but would just use the standard math font for that - I like it when math glyphs look different from text glyphs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone successfully configured Emacs to run without freezing on macOS?
 On my macOS, Emacs exhibits random freezes, and this behavior varies across distributions like Emacs-Plus and EmacsMac. These freezes don't seem tied to any specific package. And when it freezes, i can only force exit the whole process.
 I THINK EmacsMac tends to freeze more when in fullscreen mode on an external monitor. But each time I think I've pinpointed and resolved the issue, it unfortunately resurfaces.Most stack traces aren't very enlightening, often showing repeated calls to functions like 'mac_gui_loop', 'dispatch_semaphore_wait_slow', and 'redisplay_internal...'.
 Is there anyone who can run Emacs on macOS without experiencing these freezes for >1 day? If so, what hardware are you using? Did you use any special configurations or fixes?
 Does native-compilation or any other flag influences this?
 I plan writing an article about Emacs on macOS, aiming for a stable and consistent environment. However, the inconsistency of these freezing issues makes it difficult to offer solid advice. Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

 And here's how I did it (this is from memory, I don't really want to delete & redo it at the moment, so if someone else tries and it doesn't work just reply and I'll try to help figure it out).
  
Install termux and emacs from these builds on sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/files/termux/ ; these are signed and configured appropriately so that Android lets them access each other's shared storage. Read the readme the…]]></summary>

'(org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO" "WAITING" "|" "DONE" "CANCELLED")))
  
I noticed what may be a bug that I have not been able to replicate. In my org-mode file I have a repeating task similar to the one below:
  
TODO Wash car 
 <2024-01-14 +1m>
  
After completing the task, I type c-t c-d. Because the task is repeating, org-mode typically reschedules the task one month into the future. However, when I typed c-t c-d, the status of the task changed to DONE.
 Without changing any of the syntax, I typed c-t c-t, which toggled the status back to TODO. After typing c-t c-d again, the task rescheduled one month into the future, as expected.
 I have been unable to replicate the error. Any explaination?

 The problem with this one is that it always gave the mapped list without the last element, and I can see why. But my question is why does this code work:
 mymap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b] mymap f (x:xs) = f x : mymap f xs mymap _ [] = []

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm just getting started, so forgive me if this is naturally part of the method or just ... impractical in the long run, but so far it's been my experience that people think a lot about their UID's, copying them out if they're analog, and just... it's a lot.
my entire career as a Humanities professor, with diverse interests in Sciences, Maths, and pretty much everything, I was going to have to add another 0 to do those disciplines justice in the first place. 

  
10000 - Humanities
11000 - Arts (Performing and Visual)

  
11100 - Music

  

  
11200 - Theatre

  
12000 - History

  
12800 - English/British/UK History

  

  
12900 - French History

  
13000 - Literature

  
1381[act.scene]  (For some reason... when I was reading Bussy d'Ambois by George Chapman, I placed it here in Literature instead of in Theatre... If I recall, I had a reason for this. I don't remember what it was, though. I want to say it was because I was saving "Theatre" for like... theatre theory? Anyway, to explain this UID, 13 for literature, 8 for George Chapman being English, 1 for George Chapman the author/playwright himself being the first author and 0 will be for Shakespeare. )

  
14000 - Philosophy

  
1401[book#].[Stephanus number(paragletter)]Folgezettel# - 1 for The Republic, 0 for Plato

  


I have two separate systems going, apparently, in two categories under Humanities. But they both reflect something important, I feel. 
I was wondering, does anyone else use their UIDs to tell them information about the card? I'm also using a date at the top, in case I can't figure out where to put it when I first make the card [YYMMDD, of course.] Like, the way i use 8 to mean "England/English" or 9 to mean "France/French" under across History and Literature. Alternatively, 0 could mean Greece and 1 for Plato in the context of Philosophy's 14018.532b1. Just thinking aloud.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross posting this from Discourse:
 I’ve been looking into Haskell’s data ecosystem. There seems to be a lot of foundational work that is missing that I’d like to help implement (if such efforts already exist) or start to implement with a group of Haskellers who have time. Namely:
  
A flat buffer library - the current one is abandoned and isn’t featured in the official flat buffer documentation despite some seemingly niche language called Lobster being supported.
 an Apache Arrow compatible data frame library (along with the rest of the apache arrow suite)
 A well supported plotting library
  
I think this was somewhat initially the vision of dataHaskell but that effort seems to have fizzled out. Were there learnings published somewhere? What were the pitfalls? Is there still activity in the community?

https://github.com/CleanCocoa/OpenAny
Here's the gist: you can create links to open file with app, e.g. to create a dashboard of sorts with Markdown notes in e.g. The Archive
openany://app/TextEdit/view?path=/path/to/file.txt

Excerpt from the README
Why?
Any app that renders URLs as clickable links can now become your external app or file launchpad.
🎉 Create open-file-with-app links anywhere!
🌎 Assemble dashboards to your projects in your favorite note-taking app!
For example, you can use this in almost any Markdown editor with syntax highlighting to get a clickable link that will open TextEdit:

 * TODO Out of bed by 7h SCHEDULED: <2024-01-16 Tue 07:00 +1d> :PROPERTIES: :STYLE: habit :END: 
 By the nature of this habit, it can either be done (I get out of bed before 7am) or I may fail (I stay in bed until after 7am).
 The point is that if I don't manage to get out of bed by 7am this task should not appear as an overdue todo the following day as if I could still do it for the previous day. I want to mark it as failed on the day it was scheduled and also see it as a failed / not done state in the habit graph of the org agenda. Any ideas how this is typically done in orgmode?
