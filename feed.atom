        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings Emacsians! I, emacs noob, am back with additional questions. I am configuring emacs to be my personal calendar and task management system. I really like the "M-x org-agenda a"
 view's information, but I don't like its formatting.
 First and foremost, long lines look terrible. I have "word wrap visual line mode" activated, which wraps lines in all org files. I also have the "adaptive-wrap" packaged installed and active, and that makes the text wrapping in normal org mode files look much better since indenting is respected. However, this package seems to have no effect on the org agenda views. 
 Q: How can I force org agenda views to also wrap nicely such that indentation is respected? (i.e. like "adaptive-wrap" does for ordinary org mode files?)
 Separately, there are two other aspects of the org agenda view formatting I'd like to change (including them here since they are also related to org agenda view formatting even though they are otherwise separate issues).
 (1) Since the todo's are pulled from multiple files with different filename lengths, the "todo" keywords and descriptions of the todos are not aligned, and this makes the view look visually chaotic. Is there a way to tell the agenda daily/weekly view not to include the filename of each todo?
 (2) There is no extra vertical space between one todo and the next which makes it visually difficult to see where one todo ends and the next one begins. Is there a way to specify that a small amount of vertical margin beneath every todo?

For me, history is a way of connecting various pieces of evidence from the past, both diachronically (connecting similar items over time) and synchronically (connecting different items from the same time), to find patterns and to draw conclusions.  A Zettelkasten would therefore seem an ideal tool for making these connections and helping to draw the relevant conclusions.  However, the way I work doesn't seem to fit the Zettelkasten 'method' described in this forum, especially in relation to reading notes.
The first stage of my work is to collect the evidence, usually from various different primary sources.  This usually involves noting the evidence verbatim.  I may summarise it later, but I need to work from the original evidence…]]></summary>

 I'm trying to create a function that I can call with a key binding that will prompt me for a buffer (I'm thinking (counsel-ibuffer) style), and open the buffer as a new split next to my current buffer. Since the native emacs split functions only take dimensions as arguments (so far as I can tell) and I use evil mode, here is what I have:
  (defun other-buff-to-split () (interactive) (evil-split-buffer '(counsel-ibuffer))) 
 If you guys know of any way to get this working, please let me know. Thank you!
 EDIT: Resolved, thanks to u/flexibeast. Here is their code for people with this problem in the future:
 ``` (defun other-buff-to-split () (interactive) (ivy-read "Switch to buffer: " (counsel-ibuffer--get-buffers) :history 'counsel-ibuffer-history :action #'other-buff-to-split-1))
 (defun other-buff-to-split-1 (x) (evil-split-buffer (cdr x))) ```

 If I go to the shell and manually use gpg command to decrypt a file, and I enter my passphase in the shell, the passphase is cached for a certain time. When the passphase is cached, I can now decrypt the .gpg file by opening it in dired, and this seems to be the only way that I can successfully decrypt a file automatically. It is not only annoying but stupid.
 Why is Emacs not prompting for anything when it needs my passphase? Am I missing any configurations to make it works?
 I am using Emacs 28.0.5 with native compilation.
 Edit: I am using Arch and Exwm and I use startx to initialize Emacs. I just noticed that, when I quit Emacs, I saw the tty shell was prompting for passphase, I have no way to enter my passphase there when I am in GUI mode, what am I supposed to do?

 That being said, Scala 3 support still needs some love. There are issues, mostly around JVM/Scala compatibility (Java modules *coff* *coff*) . Now I will spend some time describing what I found about them the best I could - and nagging the above-mentioned brilliant people to take a look. But, all in all, I think we're really doing great. I didn't expect the migration to be so easy. Just as earlier I didn't expect all these different pieces would so easily fall into their places and a Scala app on Android would just work. I feel... grateful. And also super happy - hence the tone of this entry.
 Cheers 😊

 Seems like a possible alternative to using org-mode for todo lists, but I can only find a few mentions of it online.
 I think I like the structure it imposes, because sometimes org-mode's many features and flexibility can be distracting. 
 Is it harder to integrate with other parts of Emacs?

Then I use some function and the rest of the column goes to a new inserted line. Thanks in advance for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a way to define a "super type" in Scala? It seems like types can not implement traits. What I want to do is something like this example, where I basically I have this trait:
 type ScrollBar = ... type Window = ... trait Widget[A] { def CreateScrollBar[B]() : ScrollBar def CreateWindow[B]() : Window } 
 And some type that implement it using ad hoc polymorphism:
 implicit val pmWidget : Widget[PMWidget] = new Widget[PMWidget] { def CreateScrollBar[PMScrollBar](): ScrollBar = ... def CreateWindow[PMWindow](): Window = ... } 
 But I want both ScrollBar and Window to be of a specific type, referent to my PMWidget:
 type MotifScrollBar = ... type MotifWindow = ... type MotifWidget = (MotifScrollBar, MotifWindow) 
 Is there a way to do this using type declarations? I thought about something like:
 type ScrollBar[A] = A type Window[A] = A 
 But if I implement it like this (using ints just to simplify):
 type MotifScrollBar = Int type MotifWindow = Int implicit val pmWidget : Widget[MotifWidget] = new Widget[MotifWidget] { def CreateScrollBar[MotifScrollBar](): ScrollBar[MotifScrollBar] = 0 // type mismatch here def CreateWindow[MotifWindow](): Window[MotifWindow] = 0 // type mismatch here } 
 I'm getting type mismatches where I indicated. Is there some workaround?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Functions from packages are reported as natively compiled, but my ".el" files are not.
 EmacsWiki: GCC Emacs said:
  
When a byte-compiled Elisp module is loaded, it gets queued for native compilation. Once native compilation has finished, the native-compiled definitions automatically replace the byte-compiled versions.
  
In my config:
 (setq native-comp-deferred-compilation t) (byte-recompile-file file nil 0 'load) 
 But functions in file are just byte-compiled, even after a looong time. I have seen emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load, but isn't it usable for active buffers only?

 As in the title; I have forked general.el to add a few autoloaded keywords of my own, by using the :general keyword use-package functions as a template. However, this bit of code, originally used for :general, is not working (read "not being autoloaded"):
 emacs-lisp (defun use-package-handler/:gone (name _keyword args rest state) "Use-package handler for :gone." (use-package-concat (use-package-process-keywords name rest state) `(,@(mapcar (lambda (arglist) ;; Note: prefix commands are not valid functions (if (or (functionp (car arglist)) (macrop (car arglist))) `(,@arglist :package ',name) `(general-def (:keymaps '(global aiern-insert-state-map aiern-normal-state-map)) ,@arglist :package ',name))) (plist-get args :arglists))))) 
 The part I have changed is the general-def bit, by adding (:keymaps '(global aiern-insert-state-map aiern-normal-state-map)). When demanding the package, it works fine. Am I missing anything here? I've also copied the use-package-autoloads/:general and use-package-handler/:general functions as well, which are exactly the same, and renaming them appropriately.
 Thank you kindly for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an issue where my .dir-locals are getting bigger and bigger, namely due to my current projects using prettier in quite a few different major modes. But also due to specific eglot setups. Enabling prettier and eglot for the relevant major-mode would work in these projects, but would start becoming annoying in the others.
 In trying to move most of the logic to my Emacs configuration and have less duplicates in each of my project roots, I tried the following:
 ;; path/to/my/project/.dir-locals.el ((nil . ((me/eglot-p . t) (me/prettier-p . t)))) ;; dotemacs.el (use-package prettier :preface (defvar-local me/prettier-p nil "Should prettier be enabled?") :hook (web-mode . me/prettier-mode-maybe) :config (put 'me/prettier-p 'safe-local-variable #'booleanp)) (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () "Enable `prettier-mode' when the prettier executable is found locally." (when me/prettier-p (prettier-mode))) 
 The issue with that is that dir-local variables are taken into account after web-mode-hook has kicked in, even with nil when no major-mode is specified. So me/prettier-p is always nil in me/prettier-mode-maybe.
 A second attempt, ignoring dir-local variables altogether, looked like this:
 (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () "Enable `prettier-mode' when the prettier executable is found locally." (when-let ((command (shell-command-to-string "npm list -p prettier")) (prettier-p (length> (string-trim-right command) 0))) (prettier-mode))) 
 Which is obviously too slow to be acceptable.
 What are your preferred methods to avoid having to copy the same .dir-locals.el every time you start a similar project or even reinstall your machine(s)? That was actually my case btw: I realized while reinstalling my machine how much stuff I had to copy around after cloning all my repositories.

 Tomorrow, Saturday June 19, 17:00 Zurich time, there will be a GHC ask-me-anything panel discussion.
 It will be live-streamed on YouTube on the ZuriHac channel.
 We will have Simon Peyton-Jones and Ben Gamari on the panel as GHC developers, and we need you to ask them questions!
 You can ask your questions:
  
Live via the ZuriHac Discord, channel #ghc-panel-discussion
 Live via the libera.chat IRC channel #ghc; prefix your question with nh2: ZuriHac GHC AMA question:
 Here any time (I will collect the questons until 1 hour before the event)
  
The questions will read to the panelists during the event.
 We'd like to get technical questions about GHC, e.g. “how does class instance lookup work?”, not so much personal questions like “how long have you worked on GHC?”.
  
ZuriHac is the world's largest Haskell Hackathon. It is free to join, and this year it is remote, so you can join simply by registering on https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2021/ Registering will send you the Discord invite, in case you want to ask your questions there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Hideout?
  
Hideout is a self-hosted service that makes private, persistent chat rooms possible. It requires no installation or account creation. Unlike disposable chat, a Hideout room preserves privacy without expiring.
 The GitHub repo contains a detailed introduction, and guides for hosting, building, and contributing: https://github.com/techmindful/hideout
 A video demo can be watched here: https://vimeo.com/564494164.
 A demo instance is running at hideout-demo.com. Uptime is expected to be unstable. Do not trust it for your own private conversations.
 Language stack is Haskell/Elm. Haskell, Elm, and the privacy community need more killer apps! Hideout tries to be as pretty and feature-rich as possible, so that when people opt for privacy, they won't be getting a lackluster alternative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Chordify is hiring again! This post might look familiar to you if you've been around here for a while. That's because I posted about a vacancy we had back in October. Since then, we've hired two new developers, but we're still expanding!
 Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net
 Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also have a custom Redis caching layer and use an advanced Cloud Haskell setup to distribute our chord analysis computations.
 We are quickly becoming an autonomous workforce, meaning there is pretty much no hierarchy, and we are looking to expand our fast-growing team with a pro-active, independent and creative functional programmer to further improve Chordify. You'd get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.
 More information and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [rik@chordify.net](mailto:rik@chordify.net).
 We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.
 One more thing, this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We expect our new colleague to come work with us at our (new!) office in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Zettelkasten friends,
I've been processing papers on psychology lately (on retrieval practice and reading comprehension) but I'm having trouble implementing the concept of "layers of evidence" as described in https://zettelkasten.de/posts/layers-of-evidence/.
In the post, @sfast said: (my emphasis for context)

  
The next layer of evidence is the interpretation of data patterns. The phenomenological layer meant you describe what you saw. Here, you interpret why you saw it.
Now the concept of causality can come into play. You can explain the correlation above by saying: Drowning people in swimming pools generates amplifiers for the nuclear power plants in the U.S, and that’s why when more people drown in swimming pools, more energy is generated in nuclear power plants.

 When I performed ediff between two files, after providing file B, the emacs hanged, without displaying the ediff buffers, but the status area shows "processing difference regions ... done". 
 The emacs process has to be aborted through task manager. C-g would not work, neither SPC q 
 The emacs version is Emacs 27.1. 
 The emacs-config of tecosaur (https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-config) is used with the recent Doom. 
 Here is a screenshot showing where it hanged and the high CPU utilization of the emacs process. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2638417/122454243-05707c00-cf60-11eb-8bb7-93c39339811d.png) 
 I tried ediff-buffers has the same problem.(edited)
 I really like emacs-config that I want to make it work. Thanks in advance for helps!

He say's we need a container to store the result i.e, myresult[ aggSum ] . My question is Why do we need to store the result ( aggSum ) inside myResult ( container ), when we can represent the sum of elements using aggSum. If he says Optional[aggSum] / Either[aggSum] I would understand but he wants to store it in a container. So what exactly is a container ?, why is it's purpose ?, does it has to do anything with generics.

 However, I have no idea what caused this, where to fix it, and how to fix it. Can anyone help? I've looked around, but can't find a good answer.
 Also, when I run emacs -Q, the terminal DOES seem to work fine.

I'm trying to set up org mode for personal task management and have come across the issue that apparently org mode list items can't be todo items (only checkmarked items) and that only headings can actually be org mode todos. This is quite a disappointment as I enjoy the automatic numbering and nicely formatted nestability available for lists and also the agenda views of todo items, and I would very much like to use them together.
 Are there any packages which fix this dilemma? Or any elisp way to do this? Or are miracles real and is there a way to actually do this in normal org mode? Any of these would be much appreciated!
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm mostly a Java guy, but with the new functional bits in Java I found Scala people many times have already developed good practices for things we are still struggling with, so I'm asking here.
 Recently there is a trend in my workplace to replace null-friendly values with Optional, so (simplified case, you get the idea)
 NamedObject obj = ..... if(obj == null){ return "no object, so no name" } else { return obj.name(); } 
 becomes
 Optiona<NamedObject> opt = .... return opt.map(NamedObject::name).orElse("no object, so no name") 
 I like that, but I don't know how to handle logging. When I have
 NamedObject obj = ..... if(obj == null){ logger.warn("there was no object") return "no object, so no name" } else { logger.debug("using actual name of the object") return obj.name(); } 
 What would be the proper way to keep the logging functionality in a more functional way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello emacsians! I am an emacs noob customizing my config for the first time. Every emacs tutorial seems to call for installing either Ivy or Helm, however few are able to describe why they are necessary without referring to use cases and jargon that I either can't relate to or don't understand (my use cases for now involve task management, calendar management, and writing with only a small secondary emphasis on coding).
 I've opted not to go with Helm for now based on some complaints about performance, but the question remains of whether or not to install Ivy. So, for those of you who have experienced both vanilla emacs and Ivy emacs, what are the features (if any) that Ivy provides that you just can't live without? Also, what are the worst things about Ivy?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am beginner learning Haskell and Cabal toolchain/workflow. Currently, I am compiling simple Haskell code with C-wrapper into foreign native shared library on Linux. To make the toolchain commands and package loading/(future) dependencies easier to manage, I am doing it with Cabal. I found a reference in this site (among others):
 http://www.vex.net/~trebla/haskell/so.xhtml
 At first, I missed key point:
 "The Haskell code is to be listed under other-modules."
 I did not set the other-modules field and my build wasnt working. Now it works. But I wanted to ask why the name of the field was chosen as to other-modules, since it actually makes the connection between Haskell code and the C code wrapper? Without having the clue that "it doesnt work without it," I would never try to search for something like that ...
 Let me know if this is not the correct place to ask this question and where would a better place for that be.

 I was wondering what options do we have in org-mode to save metadata on web links.
 I have counted 6500 https?:// links in all my notes and I would like to categorize at least some of them, in time.
 I don't want to use titles for them, but I know that only titles have properties, or drawers.
 Right now my pseudo random convention is:
 
 This is a list of useful links:
 Wow, this article is so nice:
 https://example.com/whatever
 > summary line 1
 > summary line 2
 Written by the same author as the previous:
 https://foo.bar.com/stuff
 > summary line
 > summary line 2
 
 I would like to add metadata such as:
  
some tags, or categories for the links (eg: technical, art, spiritual)
 if it's a git repo mention the programming language
 if it's an article mention the author's name
 if I save it offline, take a note about that
 different fields that I don't know yet
  
Does anyone use anything like that? Maybe there's a library that does something similar?
 Thank you
 edit: fix formatting

This uses two short and straightforward Keyboard Maestro macros. One to place the file in the /media directory and then forms the link, placing it in the clipboard for pasting, and the second calls the file and opens it in its default application. This all works beautifully with my Two Window Workflow keeping the target note in focus while reviewing the attachment alongside in a separate window. Simple is as simple does!
This video shows this process in action. The triggers are hard to grasp and hard to display. The trigger for the "Form Media Links" macro is ⌃⌥⇧⌘M whi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a lib that would allow me to build up a markdown doc using some DSL out of primitives (Blocks, Inlines, etc) and then simply convert it to a `Text` representation (i.e. render into text).
 This seems like such an easy thing to do, I've googled for potential solutions to this however and I'm having a real hard time figuring out how to do this with current libs available on hackage.
 I've looked at `cmark` `mmark`, even `pandoc` to no avail. It seems to me that libs like `mmark` are designed to only parse markdown documents, ensure conformity to standards, and render to html.
 I thought `pandoc` would be my saving grace (which I reluctantly tried to use since it's such a large dependency), their `Block` DSL seems fine, but even `pandoc` does not have something like `render :: Pandoc -> Text`. It does have `writeMarkdown :: PandocMonad m => WriterOptions -> Pandoc -> m Text` but i really want to have a pure rendering function without all this `PandocMonad` complication (which seems superfluous if I want to render into a simple `Text` doc).
 (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-2.14.0.2/docs/Text-Pandoc-Writers-Markdown.html) 
 Anyone has a suggestion?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Haskell project that I've been working on over the last few years.
 One thing I absolutely love about Haskell is that its so easy to refactor with confidence, for example renaming and changing types, and the compiler flags any issues early on.
 What I would like to do now is to consolidate the names of parameters. So for example, I started with a function for working with indices and counts of elements.
 ```
 indicesRemaining :: Cnt -> Idx -> [Idx]
 indicesRemaining cnt idx = <some-implentation>
 ```
 and say I've renamed the types to be clearer, using a global find-replace:
 ```
 indicesRemaining :: BlockCnt -> BlockIdx -> [BlockIdx]
 indicesRemaining cnt idx = <some-implementation>
 ```
 this is great, but I'd like to also update cnt and idx, to be blkCnt and blkIdx, for example. I can do in manually, but I've done a load of refactorings, so have a load of these.
 What I am looking for is a tool that can run over my code-base, and spurt out a list of types, and all the different variables names used by that type. So, if I have the following code:
 ``` indicesRemaining :: BlockCnt -> BlockIdx -> [BlockIdx]
 indicesRemaining blkCnt blkIdx = <some-implementation>
 indexWithinCnt :: BlockCnt -> BlockIdx -> Bool
 indexWithinCnt cntMax idx = <some-implementation>
 ```
 Then, I am looking for something like the following output:
 ``` BlockCnt : blkCnt, cntMax
 BlockIdx : blkIdx, idx
 ```
 And I can then go through and manually review cases where lots of different names exist for the same thing.
 Is anyone aware whether something like this already exists? If not, I was wondering if HIE would be a good tools to build something like this on top of??
 Best wishes, and thanks in advance.
 Mike

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an IDE user (JetBrains currently, Visual Studio when I used to write C#) with basic Vim knowledge, using primarily Java and JS with some TS. I'm getting tired of the less-than-useful vim support in the IDE space, as well as general inflexibility in setting up workflows. I've been looking into emacs (spacemacs) as a daily-driver, and I like almost everything about it. However, I'm not sure what I'll do with a certain part of my workflow that relies on refactoring support.
 This applies less to new features, and more to maintenance work on legacy(ish) code, which is honestly a lot of what I do. I've come to heavily rely on Kent Beck's "make the hard change easy" advice, combined with Arlo Belshee's read by refactoring. I like that I can use chains of known-safe IDE refactorings to rapidly explore and change the structure of a body of code before I even understand what it's doing, and know that I'm not changing the semantics in the process.
 Seems like a decent portion of my go-to tools are supported in JS with js2-refactor, but not all. (Haven't looked at whether it works with TS yet, and Tide may also be able to fill some holes even when applied to plain-JS.) On the other hand meghanada has been a bit disappointing in the refactoring department. Rust, if I ever work with that, looks to have an absolutely phenomenal language server.
 In addition to my two primaries, I'd like to be confident in branching out into, say, Go, Kotlin, or Swift, and I see about as much refactoring support for each of those as what meghanada has for Java; that is, nearly nothing.
 What do experienced emacs-ians do for these tasks? Do former IDE users among you not miss automated refactorings? Do you have emacs-native workflows that reliably work for, say, "extract/inline variable/function/parameter"?

 explore :: (ComonadCofree f w, MonadFree f m) => (w a -> m b -> m b) -> w a -> m b explore f = wrap . fmap (\w -> f w (explore f w)) . unwrap 
 I've been calling it explore because it behaves as a kind of fold over a cofree comonad into a free monad: the first argument to f is the part of the comonadic "environment" that's getting "explored" in this step, and the second argument is the future monadic "exploration" that covers the "rest of the environment".
 Is this a thing? I haven't been able to find anything on Hackage with exactly this functionality, but I'm afraid I don't quite have the categorical vocabulary to easily tell if it's a special case of a definition in adju…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any way to do this? I'd like all my org mode files to be part of an "org project", regardless of their locations. I use projectile, ibuffer, ibuffer-projectile, and (obviously) org-mode.
 At the moment I've got:
 (setq org-directory "~/.emacs.d/config/org/") (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups (quote [...] ("orgproject" (or (name . "^\\*Org Agenda\\*$") (mode . org-mode))) 
 which I thought would do it, but it doesn't. I expected all buffers with org-mode active would be listed within an "orgproject" group in ibuffer, and files that are in the org-directory are in that group, but files that are in other directories, even though they're open and in org-agenda-files, just go into a general group in ibuffer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to use shakle to tame the pop ups that I have (in combination with popper). One case I have is AUCTeX which displays a list of errors if the document fails to compile. Clicking on an error brings up a new window which shows details of the error.
 I wanted to set it so that the list of errors appear at the bottom and then the error description appears at the right of the error list. I tried the following
  (setq shackle-rules '(("*TeX errors*" :select t :align below :size 0.2) ("*TeX Help*" :select t :align right :size 0.5))) 
 Now, if I have a window displaying the latex file, the list of errors appears at the bottom as expected, but then clicking on an error adds a vertical window spanning the whole interface (both the latex buffer and the error list buffer) instead of splitting the window which displays "TeX errors". 
 Is there a way to get my desired window splitting?

More precisely, I just want to remove the (ivy-rich-switch-buffer-project (:width 0.18 :face success)) part of it, that shows to which project a buffer belongs when switching buffers. Redefining the entire variable without this bit clutters my config a lot since this variable has a lot of content. Is there a few to just remove that bit from the original value of the variable? I tried to do it using my limited elisp, but I couldn't do it even in a semi-elegant way. Any tips there? Cheers!

 I can never remember the syntax, and I don't use it often enough to learn it, so it would be most helpful if I could go M-x insert-file-local-variable or something.
 Ok, so this is where Emacs is great:
 After I remembered that it is called "file local variables" I did M-x apropos file-local and found... add-file-local-variable which does exact what I wanted.
 So the answer is: Yes!

I want to maintain type-aligned-ness in my data structure, but since type information only includes the types of the beginning and the end, I suspect it might be hard to write a function with the right type signature like so:
 split :: ConsList a z -> ConsList a b -> ConsList b z
 or even just:
 tail :: ConsList a z -> ConsList b z
 Alternatively, is this possible using free monads?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am writing an Emacs Lisp package's documentation with Org mode. Currently, I am manually exporting the document to the Texinfo format, but I sometimes forget to do this.
 Is there a way to automate this, beyond just using after-save-hook? 
  
Could this be done by Emacs when installing the package?
 Could this be done by Github after I push to the repo?
 Are there existing packages that have automated this step?
  
Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So here's the setup. I've got two projects. 
 f:\project-base
 f:\project-base\specific-case
 I cannot change the layout of these projects; they're not under my control.
 It's legitimate to want to compile project-base on its own. However, most of the time I want to compile specific-case.
 Both project-base and specific-case have .dir-locals.el files, and I'm using the files to define relative paths to tools and the like. I've defined an override variable that I can set within a hydra called project--path-override. However, if I invoke my hydra while visiting a buffer that's in project-base, it uses the .dir-locals.el from that directory. That's kind of as I expect, but if my override is set, I'd like to figure out a way to use the locals from the override directory.
 Even if I invoke the hydra and set the default-directory to the project--path-override and call (hack-dir-local-variables-non-file-buffer), the local variables from project-base are still set.
 I don't really want to have to defvar all of these configuration variables somewhere and update them every time I switch project directories; being free of that management is exactly why I'm using .dir-locals.el in the first place. 
 I also thought that I might be able to create a fake buffer as part of invoking the hydra, but that seems like a needless mess of its own. 
 Anyone have a more manageable solution? I can always switch back to a file in specific-case, but I often forget to do that and launch a compile in the wrong directory first. Plus, I'm doing most of my work in project-base, so I end up having to visit random files that I actually don't care about in specific-case just to get the vars to be set right. (I could also modify the .dir-locals.el in project-base to match the one in specific-case, but this falls apart if I ever try to do anything in specific-case2.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Figured I'd ask here before wasting a bunch of time trying to figure this one out on my own, since Googling and C-h i haven't turned up easy solutions yet.
 When I write docstrings in my Lisp code, I like the source to be auto-filled so that line breaks appear in sensible places, but I don't like those auto-filled newlines to appear in the runtime versions of those docstrings (since the line width may vary between my editor and whatever is printing the docstring). To that effect, I've been using auto-fill-mode to insert newlines as appropriate, and then manually putting backslash characters at the end of each broken lines. This is undesirable for a few reasons, including that it means auto-fill makes some lines longer than will fit once I've added a space and a backslash.
 Is there any way to get fill-paragraph to insert these backslashes for me?

I happily published it and.. what do you, guys, usually do with the articles of yours then?
The final article definitely does contain some valuable knowledge (valuable to me certainly). If I have found something like this on the internets, I would probably compose several zettles out of it and saved to the local storage for references (I tend to not just link to the web, but also store referred things locally so they don't disappear).
But in this particular case, zettels the article was based on do exist already, there's nothing new to extract. What do you usually do with the work of yours?
- Do you still add it to your Zettelkasten as a giant Zettel?
- Or do you store it and make a dummy zettel just so that you have a link to this reference in ZK?
- Or do you review your existing zettels that contributed to the article and add a reference to the final target?
- Or do you do nothing as all the knowledge from this article is in your ZK already and that's good enough?
- Or something else?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I have a new notation for rendering function application and composition at the type level. It may make some Haskell concepts clearer and may be useful for expressing other things such as complicated logical combinators
 The change is simple, just write the function result type on a 3-D plate and have the function argument type orbit it--hence the term orbit diagram. It's rendered in orthographic perspective. Something about the extra dimension and the clear difference between domain and codomain make it easier to see what's going on when function types get complicated. In particular it helped me grasp the Yoneda lemma and continuation-passing style better
 More info in the readme and some examples can be found in the following repo:

 mothers, fathers, elder siblings. listen to your little fellows when they come to you, and say "my friends are trying something", or if they say "when i grow up, i want to customise my text editor". i beg you, deliver them from this.. this... evil. or else, you may have to watch them edit-last-kbd-macro, with your hands tied, and heart broken. i was young, alone, and misguided, but you're adults and you can understand. listen to this lost soul!

I guess this is similar to using "expand-selection", but I wonder if it's possible to mimic the LibreOffice behaviour. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to get better at the language, and the way to achieve that (that makes the most sense to me) is to apply for a job to be trained. So I've been job hunting for Haskell positions. 
 Naturally, I got rejected from most of the applications. I'm expecting to get rejected in all, tbh. Getting rejected doesn't bother me though since I'm pretty new to Haskell anyway. This is pretty much the only expected outcome.
 Anyway, I'm more concerned with how I can get my first step through an internship. It (internship) appears to be non-existent in the Haskell industry, which it makes it difficult to get some really good hands-on training with the proper learning environment. So with that, it seems like internship is pretty much impossible. I noticed a common expectation among the rejection messages that I'm expected to have more experience with the language. But getting this experience is rather difficult, and I don't really see a clear path to obtain a decent enough experience with it.
 I'm wondering: 
  
Do personal projects hold any weight in the deliberation process?
 Is contributing to Haskell OSS the only/better way for people to validate that I know something?
 Do I just work for free?
 How do I know what I'm doing isn't a bad approach without anyone there to program with or to act as a mentor? I'm pretty much alone in self-learning. I tried streaming but it's sometimes very distracting, and really daunting.
  
This post isn't meant to gather pity from others, please don't pity me! I just want to know what I should focus on doing exactly to get a much better chance next time, since this entire thing feels like a chicken and egg situation. If you're a business owner, or an employee in a company that uses Haskell in your company, any insight would be much appreciated!
 Thank you

 I'm using mbsync and mu4e with a very large IMAP tree. It takes ages to update. On the other hand, thunderbird very quickly updates the inboxes. I suspect that thunderbird has more frequent checks (polling the IMAP server for new messages) for inboxes compared to other folders. Is something similar possible in mysync ? Right now, the delay between reception on the server and mu4e updating is just too long.

 I'm looking for a solution to switch between tabs (tab-bar) using ivy counsel. Like bookmarks can visibly be integrated into the list of possible completion in counsel-switch-buffer and was wondering if we could add also a list of tabs for switching to them ? Anybody tried to do something similar ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 A super noob question but I've been digging into theming (as one does) and wanted to know how to tell if a theme is a "color theme" or a "custom theme"? I'm inclined to go with the "color theme" variant as it seems to be super easy to reset to the original state. Also I am only wanting color changes and not interface changes (yet).
 As an example monokai for emacs.
 Thanks!

writing format that tries to combine the readability and intuitiveness of
Markdown with the rigorous requirements of technical authoring and publishing.
It offers power and flexibility without resorting to HTML or tool-specific

or features like automatically generating a table of contents.
This post presents a new AsciiDoc parser and converter in Haskell, called
asciidoc-hs. It has been developed
with the support of a Tweag Open Source Fellowship, and is BSD licensed. It
aims to be the first AsciiDoc processor that can be directly used as a Pandoc
front-end1. It is still far from complete
in terms of AsciiDoc syntax and features, but it hopefully establishes a solid
foundation to build up…]]></summary>

application will query a REST service that serves XML (preferred) or JSON
 that XML links to other endpoints that might get queried depending on user-interaction
 the served XML changes infrequently, usually less than once every 2h
  
Because the data gets changed relatively seldomly and I don't want to query too much (rate-limits) I want to cache the responses.
 Is anyone doing something similar? What library can you recommend?
  
Currently I am thinking about the following options:
  
hedis: seems a good suit but I will need to figure out Redis
 acid-state or TCache: seem the next best suit?
 beam-sqlite: seems sub-optimal as I don't really need persistence but I am familiar with it
  
What options/libraries am I overlooking? Preferably, I would like a more light-weight solution and avoiding pulling in too many dependencies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 So I use 'Swiper' but have found that it chugs like crazy on a huge log file (ex: Takes a minute to process a query if its a specific date in a log file).
 I currently use Helm and Company in my config.
 I mention this because I tried employing this workaround in this GitHub post, but it uses Ivy unfortunately:
 https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/416
 ​
 This is the workaround:
 (global-set-key "\C-s" 'ora-swiper)
 ​
 (defun ora-swiper ()
 (interactive)
 (if (and (buffer-file-name)
 (not (ignore-errors
 (file-remote-p (buffer-file-name))))
 (if (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
 (> (buffer-size) 60000)
 (> (buffer-size) 300000)))
 (progn
 (save-buffer)
 (counsel-grep))
 (swiper--ivy (swiper--candidates))))
 ​
 Any ideas on how to avoid conflicts and what I could use instead? It appears from the workaround the 'counsel-grep' is the way to go though (which I believe is the front-end for 'ripgrep').
 ​
 I'm assuming I would have to find Helm's version of 'swiper--ivy (swiper--candidates)' instead, but wanted to confirm this.
 ​
 Or should I somehow figure out how to grep the entire file for a search query, and redirect it to a new temporary buffer instead?

 Repost with a more descriptive header after suggestion from github-alphapapa. :)
 I am a bit lost and need some help to get nudged in the right direction. 
 Using Doom Emacs and Org mode with Org Roam.
 I've set up a set of org-roam-capture-templates. When I try to create a new file, by entering a filename that does not exist, with Org-roam-find-file (SPC n r f), I am prompted with the Capture templates. 
 Before I set up Capture templates, a new file would be created when I entered a filename that did not exist.
 What I want is for the file to be created, as it did before I set up Capture templates.
 I've tried Googling and reading in the manual, but I must be missing it.
 Does anyone know what I can read up on and provide a link, or maybe let me know what I've missed? If you let me know what I've missed, I would be very grateful if you could tip me on what I should have read in order to figure it out myself.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running into a weird issue with Emacs recently. I am declaring directory-local variable in a .dir-locals.el, e.g., 
 ((nil . ((pyvenv-workon . "fancy-python-env")))) 
 When I open a file in the same directory as my .dir-locals.el for the first, emacs used to ask me whether to mark the newly declared variable as safe. But recently, I must have messed something up in emacs config because it longer asks me, but simply prints a warning message:
 Ignoring unsafe file local variable: pyvenv-workon 
 Any way I can revert to the previous behavior of Emacs regarding local variables?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Emacs Lisp, is there a built in system or third party package that helps you trace variables?
 I’m thinking of two ways I might want to do this. 
  
Like trace-function, but for variables i.e. producing a log of updates to a variable
 With a “watch list” buffer like IDEs usually have that updates defined variables or expressions when the variables change
  
I looked through the manual and searched a bit and have not really found anything. This seems like such obvious functionality though so I feel like I must have just missed it. Thought I’d ask here before rolling my own. 
 How are people tracing variables in Elisp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two diaries I have written in org-mode, and both of them have entries in top-level headlines, where the next line is an inactive timestamp, like:
 * This is an top-level headline :headlines:orgmode:reddit: [2021-06-14 Mon 13:19] Diary entry goes here. Lots of multiline text. 
 Originally, these diary entries were in reverse chronological order. At some point, I forgot and started adding new entries at the bottom of the document. At this point, the change in order is about halfway through the document. I know I could start moving individual headlines up to the top, one by one, with M-S-up/down, but there are hundreds of entries, and I'd rather do one command that sorts the entire document.
 Is there an org-mode command that will sort all of the headlines in the document based on the inactive timestamp? Preferably with the options of either chronological or reverse chronological order?

Right now I use high-level functions to compose an email in a message-mode buffer via mu4e. But it seems like it would be smarter to just assemble the email as a string (or maybe in a hidden buffer) and then send it using sendmail-program. Has anyone done this kind of thing, and is it hard? I can keep using mu4e if it's the best option, but it's somewhat slow and I'd like to reduce the latency if possible. thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am happy to announce that I have released my new library - rrb-vector. It provides an implemention of the RRB-Vector data structure, which can be used as an alternative to Data.Sequence.Seq a (from the containers package).
 It supports very fast indexing/updating and iteration (faster than for Seq a), while other operations, like concatenation, append, prepend, take, drop, etc. are also quite efficient. Most of the operations have a complexity of O(log n), but since the logarithms are base 16, that behaves more like O(1) in most cases.
 For more information, see the documentation on Hackage. I'd be happy for your feedback!

 In some ways it feels like using a template engine, but the end-user experience is much nicer, because data is streamed from the server and everything is written on/for the backend. Almost, like a hybrid between, say, Twirl and Scala.JS/Laminar, except that client-server communication appears to be entirely transparent to the developer.

 This is a joke of course. Centaur-tabs is a great package, and I can see it becoming a nifty part of my workflow, but can't help think about how buffer-focused emacs is, and yet, tabs are a pretty standard feature in every editor and browser now. I think the tab-bar is a great visual indicator of the open buffers. And DOOM seems to have some nice integrations for it. 
 Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
 Edit - yes, I've leaned into the buffer-centric workflow for a year or more now but tab-bar mode or whatever it is that centaur-tabs offers works for me. https://xkcd.com/1172/

 I started fooling around with Linux the other day (Pop OS). I just assumed that installing Emacs via 'apt' would provide me with Emacs 27.x... No dice.
 To keep up to date on Emacs are people really building from source? Is there a package repo that keeps an up to date version?
 If I'm going to build it myself are there any options I should consider. It's a bit embarrassing that I'm so used to the install and go experience I've been getting with Emacs on the Mac.
 Edit: Turns out it was org-tempo and org-indent-mode, both of which I believe I added for Emacs 27... I can't remember if I upgraded to 27 for a specific reason or not on OS X, so I can forget ahead with 26 for now with those disabled.
 Thanks all.

 First, I want to assign the same chore (TODO item) to different family members on different days. Say, Mom does the dishes on Monday, I do them Tuesday, one of the children does them Wednesday, etc...
 Second, I want to understand how to build a break down in org-agenda to view the whole chore list for a day, week, etc, or by individual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[dyncloze is an emacs module (offered via Melpa) for testing yourself on language learning. The core idea is that you can take any piece of text in emacs, and form "clozes" (an Anki terminology), that erase the work in question and let you guess what it should be. For example, you can test, in English "in" vs. "on", and every location of those words will be replaced by a cloze, denoted by "[ ]" and you are led through each of them and asked to guess each one. At the end, it tells you how well you did.
 In version 0.1, we started with the ability just to test two or more words against each other. With this version, 0.2 (just submitted, not yet updated on Melpa), we add the ability to use regex's for testing. That opens the ability to do more useful testing, at least with European languages that have a lot of word variants and word-ending grammatical bits.
 I've added two example files, one for Spanish, one for Portuguese to demonstrate. You can load them up and try out functions such as dyncloze-es-ser-estar, which will let you guess every variant of ser and estar ("eras", "fui", "está", "estaba", etc.), but you just choose which of the verbs it belongs to: ser or estar. There's a similar function that lets you choose between perfect and imperfect tenses.
 If you'd like to contribute, please open pull requests for the language you are studying with more examples (or fix up an issues with the ones I have).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I present to you my first emacs package - atp. It's intended as a component for writing text editing commands and augmenting modal editing modes. Its main feature is the ability to automatically recognize and highlight things at point and apply commands to highlighted things or active region.
 I started working on this package because I was lookig for a new approach that would help me save a couple of keystrokes on each common task such as copying and pasting text, evaluation of lisp expressions and shell-commands, changing letter case, etc.
 For a year I used a wonderful package "expand-region" for that purpose. Despite it being very smart and useful, it requires 2 actions to select an object under the point. First, the user must navigate to the desired location, and then call er/expand-region to select an object. I thought that the second step was redundant and decided to write a package that will work without it.
 At this moment atp is unstable because it was written in a hurry and my knowledge of elisp and emacs internals isn't great. I just wanted to write something usable as soon as I could to check the viability of the chosen approach. Here is a repo and a video that demonstrates how atp works in the context of a tiny modal editing mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 The construction of my aggregate is side-effectful. I need to go to the DB, check for some invariants, then decide if I can construct it or not.
 While with side effect-free construction, I'd just create a smart constructor in a companion objects. For example:
 ```scala case class Aggregate(...)
 object Aggregate { def create(...): Either[Error, Aggregate] = ??? } ```
 Since now my creation is side effectful, I consider a few options:
 Option #1 - separate class for the factory
 ```scala case class Aggregate(...)
 class AggregateFactory[F[_]](repository: Repository[F]) { def create(...): F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] = ??? } ```
 Then I'd just pass AggregateFactory around where needed.
 Option #2 - curried smart constructor
 ```scala case class Aggregate(...)
 object Aggregate { def create[F[_]](repository: Repository[F])(...): F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] = ??? } ```
 and then I could pass around just the partially applied create function, e.g.
 scala def factory[F[_]]: ... => F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] = Aggregate.create(repository)(_) 
 What do you think is the most idiomatic approach to the side-effectful construction?

 With this deriving Traversable-like type classes and Distributive becomes possible, as well as type classes with lenses.
 As a reference MonadTrans just got a QuantifiedConstraint superclass

 But this will be more challenging, it really depends on if this is something the community wants.

They had references to some pages along with keywords and key ideas, but were mostly used for reference. And, being so, they were stored. They were permanent.
Then, reading here, I got the impression from Christian and many others that literature notes were literally notes taken on the literature (or in a notebook): marginalia, brief comments, reminders, etc. Their goal under this view is to be processed a…]]></summary>

 I have an abstract trait with a type param that represents some intermediate representation (IR) that can be converted to the type param:
  trait IR[O] { def toOutput: O } 
 I have a concrete implementation of this trait:
  case class StringIR(data: String) extends IR[(Int, String)] { def toOutput: (Int, String) = (data.length, data) } 
 Then I want to define a circe Encoder for the IR trait, assuming the O already has an Encoder.
 This is the first way I implemented it:
  implicit def encoder[O : Encoder, R <: IR[O]]: Encoder[R] = Encoder.instance { r: IR[O] => Encoder[O].apply(r.toOutput) } 
 But when I try to get an implicit Encoder for StringIR it results in a compiler error:
  diverging implicit expansion for type io.circe.Encoder[StringIR] starting with lazy value currencyEncoder in object Encoder 
 An interesting thing I noticed is that the error doesn't always mention the currencyEncoder. Sometimes it's other provided encoders.
 So then I implemented the encoder like this:
  implicit def encoder[O : Encoder, R <: IR[O]]: Encoder[R with IR[O]] = Encoder.instance { r: IR[O] => Encoder[O].apply(r.toOutput) } 
 The only difference is that I'm using Encoder[R with IR[O]] instead of Encoder[R]. 
 Here's a Scastie with a working example: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/alexklibisz/VvnYuNiGS5SN7R5GwV5cHg/25 
 It seems like the implicit resolution doesn't know that an Encoder[R with IR[O]] is the same as an Encoder[R]. I know I used Circe here, but I don't see how it would be any different for any old type class. Is there any more precise explanation for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 As there seems to be a demand for practical Haskell examples/applications, I decided to create a video series to show an example of how such an application could be developed. In this case I chose to show how to process streamed binary satellite data and build a Haskell application for this. This starts with basic things like network connections, conduits, goes over logging, config file handling, command line parsing to parsing the binary ground- and space-protocols involved, threading (for parallel processing chains), STM and finally displaying the results in a graphical user interface (with GTK). 
 This also can serve as an introduction to the AURIS mission control system I am writing in Haskell (on ZuriHac and MuniHac there was some demand for more explanations as the project is a bit intimidating and requires some domain knowledge). So I thought I could combine this and provide some insight into this domain, while showing how such an application could work in Haskell. 
 Each video builds on its predecessor. The current ones are: 
  
Video 1: Introduction and Project Setup 
 Video 2: Network Connections and Conduits 
 Video 3: Configuration Files 
 Video 4: Command Line Arguments 
 Video 5: Parsing the Transport Protocol Layer 
 Video 6: Parsing the TM Transfer Layer 
 Video 7: CRC Check, Interfacing C++, Property Tests 
 Video 8: Logging and the RIO Monad
 
 Further ones are planned, but not yet available.
 I might be going quickly sometimes (as I wanted to focus on certain areas and the videos are already quite long), so if there is a demand for more detailed explanations of certain things, let me know.
 The video series as a Youtube playlist:

The code can easily be looked up in official documentation and referred to in forums, StackOverflow, etc.. There is work underway which could lead to the same functionality in GHC.
 I wondered whether there's a particularly strong reason for numeric error codes as opposed to human readable identifiers. For example, would conflicting_trait_implementations be a more useful error code than E0119? None of the reasons given in the discussion for avoiding readable error codes rang true for me, and, surprisingly to me, no one at all supported readable error codes.
 Are my instincts completely out of tune on this issue, or would readable error codes have some benefit over numeric ones?

 But lately i have been thinking if i was wrong or if my assumptions still holds true, today ides like vs code provide all the above features in a fast modern looking ide.
 So does the question of Emacs vs Modern IDEs boils down to asthetic choice between modern vs classic/vintage or is there any real advantage in using Emacs today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a preface, I am using GHC 8.10.4, and I've read a few posts about hang ups with this version of GHC. My main build tool is Stack so using stack build --fast works just fine, while running stack build (using -O2) does causes the hang up. Some of the suggested comments from the similar posts say to sprinkle in some {- OPTIONS_GHC -O1 -} on the offending files to allow it compile. However, I can't seem to find the right one to use it on. 
 My question is: How do I debug this compiler issue? My terminal always hangs up after it prints [ 9 of 17] Compiling Display. Is this the offending file? Or is it something that comes after? 
 Are there any options I can pass to the compiler to get some more verbose output to diagnose the issue?
 Thanks
 EDIT: I've done some brief testing as per /u/manpacket suggested. Display.hs seems to be the offending file. 
 The testing is by no means robust and is simply using stack clean && stack build each time. The left hand side indicates which instance definitions have had their undefined definition returned to normal. 
 The timings are as follows:
 all undefined - 18.8s storeLoc - 18.9s storeLoc/OperandType - 18.5s storeLoc/OperandType/Operand - 22.7s storeLoc/OperandType/OpCode - 31.8s storeLoc/OperandType/Instruction - 18.8s storeLoc/OperandType/Instruction/CPUState - 43.2s storeLoc/OperandType/CPUState - 42.8s 
 It seems as though the issue stems from the repeated use of <>?
 The github repo is here if you want to take a look.

 b. second child item

 Instead of what orgmode currently does, which is:
 1\. First list item.
  
first child item
 second child item

 get renamed file on the disk and updated link in org file (something like in example below).

 Spent a couple of days now looking at various options for typescript development. Specifically, I'm interested in some refactoring workflows (extraction, renaming etc).
 There's js2-refactor. It relies on js2-mode which appears to be..quirky? It's using it's own internal linter which doesn't seem to support all of the latest TypeScript features.
 I'm now looking at LSP-mode with typescript, but there doesn't seem to be any support for refactoring.
 How are you coding typescript with emacs? Is there robust refactoring support?
 Thanks!

 I’ve just setup my first org-mode file and in it I have a hierarchy of headings as follows: Area -> Project -> Task
 Each of the levels above have unique keywords. 
 Now when it comes to agenda views is it possible to only show tasks whose parent (project) has a particular TODO keyword as well as having a particular keyword themselves. 
 For example only show “NEXT” tasks for “CURRENT” projects?
 I’m sure that there must be a way to do this, but my searches have been fruitless - I’m guessing that I’m not using the correct terminology. 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I read the ACM Queue article titled "Schrodinger's code" concerning undefined behaviors in C so I started to wonder if Haskell has them and how many.
 So quickly I found that obviously Haskell does have them here and there. There are a bunch of unsafe functions, and FFI, etc.
 What baffles me, however, is that C compilers work on the assumption that paths contain UBs are not reachable so the compilers can aggressively remove code paths and optimize code. I personally think this means (if Haskell did the same) all code paths containing bottom values are removed. This actually makes sense in a non-strict language, because the semantics of the remaining parts remain unchanged.
 Therefore, I'm asking here the question, how well do bottom values relate to UBs (or LLVM undef?) My knowledge about Haskell is still limited so maybe this similarity is just superficial and there's no serious conclusion can be drawn here.
 Another question is: will GHC actually do the same kind of optimizations? If yes, how are they justified? If no, why not? I once encountered <<loop>> (my intent was exactly making it loop). But for other scenarios the bottom values seem to be preserved, and they are even used to cancel tasks (async exceptions).
 edit: The last question is baffling me. If the bottom value can be somehow "caught" like exceptions, are they really bottom values?

 The official faq also recommends to install only packages that we can trust.
 I don't know how much of this is still relevant, but I was wondering if any of you for programming use Emacs vanilla as it is without third party packages or do you limit yourself to some of them and which ones would you recommend? 
 I'm asking especially to those who don't have time to always review every update and have to weigh the risks.

So, I have been intrigued by the ideas of both Zettelkasten and commonplace books for a while now, and I am trying to find a synthesis that fits my needs. First, I will give some definitions and differences according to my understanding.
A Zettelkasten is a place to not just store thoughts from other people, but to process them in your own words. The key thing here is linking the notes together to make an idea-generating resource. This can be accomplished with tags and with more direct internal links. Another important aspect is that the notes in the Zettelkasten, zettels, are atomic; that is, they are focused on one thing and one thing only. To summarize (at the risk of simplifying): A Zettelkasten is a network of interconnected, atomic ideas…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a new user of emacs. I recently learned about emacs client-server model. So I am in doubt that my understanding might be wrong about this system. So I will try to explain what this client-server model is in terms of emacs and I seek suggestions from this community about the validity of my understanding.
 So client-server model is basically used for utilizing the same running instance of emacs instead of opening up a new session everytime. How emacs does this is it creates a emacs server instance which keeps running in the background . Now if I want to to do something with emacs by using that single instance running in the background I will do so by emacsclient binary. For example if I want to open a file in gui frame (emacsclient -c filename) emacsclient will direct the emacs server to do so. I can create many instances of emacsclient which will use the same emacs server instance that is running in the background. By doing so I can do things in one session. Avoid the time cost of starting up a whole new session and open files quickly. There are different switches for emacsclient and emacs server which one can utilize to use different features provided by both of them. 
 Thats it. This is my current understanding of emacs client-server model and how to use it.

 I would like these to appear 'correctly' (rendered) in ebib's index window. Could I somehow render the latex to unicode or something, and display that correctly?
 If so, should I? Would this be preferable to just editting the titles to use proper unicode (which is supported by biblatex, and is feasible as there aren't too many)? I just want to know if anyone can think of pros/cons either way?

 One of the things I miss from living in a shell in a terminal emulator is the history.
 Now, the shell history was never perfect for me, while I loved being able to go back a year and find some obscure cURL/compilation command that I never noted down, I hated that there wasn't any nice metadata (working directory) associated with the commands.
 I was wondering if there's any emacs equivalent, that will keep history for any shell command functions (there's a lot, given that there are project/dired variants), but perhaps for more clever uses that I haven't thought of (eshell?)
 My question is: Does this thing already exist before I think about it myself, I think a pluggable framework would be the best approach probably.

Why do we see zero-size chunks? 
 Why are aggStreamBefore and aggStreamAfter out of order?
 Why do we see fewer aggStreamBefore operations than aggStreamAfter ?
 groupByKey is supposed tu run different groups on different fibers, but results don't seem to be intermingled...
 Why didn't the stream use the first A B A B A sequence, but started pulling another one?
 Bonus question - does FS2 have groupBy / groupByKey? I found some leftovers, but nothing besides that.

 I installed pdf-tools from Melpa with the command M-x package-install RET pdf-tools RET, and I believe it was successful.
 I then tried to open a PDF with "emacs some.pdf". It indicates pdf-tools has been launched but it does not show an image of the PDF. It shows the underlying PDF code, I believe.
 I am using Termux, a terminal emulator app. Is this because pdf-tools only works in a GUI environment, in Linux? Or is there something else I should do to make it work?
 Thanks very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm tinkering with "full stack". As far as possible, I'd like things type safe, as a big fan of how much work the compiler does on my behalf. I'm some distance from guru-dom, so I'm half pattern matching things I've pieced together over time. So far, I've got:
 - Cask on the back (no complicated effect frameworks for me!)
 - Laminar on the front
 Where I'm struggling, is joining them up. The idiom I'm following separates the definition of the API from it's implementation,.
 trait TodoApi {def listAll: Future[Either[String, Seq[Todos]]]} 
 But this can fail in two ways
  
Network
 Json parsing
  
I wanted to use upickle and sttp. Both look simple enough, and should both work back and frontend ... helpful for me to learn fewer frameworks.
 def listAll1: Future[Response[Either[String,Try[Seq[Todos]]]]] = { basicRequest.get(uri"$ApiHost/todo") .mapResponseRight(r => Try(read[Seq[Todos]](r))).send() } 
 But look at the method signature! So okay...
 object ToDoApiImpl extends TodoApi { def flattenFutureEitherTry[A](a: Future[Response[Either[String,Try[A]]]]) : Future[Either[String, A]] = { for (fut <- a) yield { fut.body match { case Left(value) => Left(value) case Right(value) => { val something = value.toEither something.left.map(_.toString()) } } } } } override def listAll: Future[Either[String,Seq[Todos]]] = flattenFutureEitherTry(listAll1) } 
 Somehow, this feels... not right. It took me quite some time poking that with a sharp stick to get it to compile. And my eyeballs hurt :-(.
 Does anyone have suggestions for something more idiomatic / easier? I get that networking isn't fun, but is this as good as it gets? Suggestions welcomed...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I have been looking for a way to move as efficiently as I do in vim in emacs. In vim, I usually use the relative line numberings to do my movements. This causes issues with folded items in org-mode. Let me illustrate.
 I have the following org file:
 1 I want to 1 2 * Jump over 3 ** this 4 * to here 5 * without overshoot 
 To go to where I want, I'd do 4j in vim, and C-u 4 C-n in emacs. However, when I fold "Jump over", I get differing line numberings.
 In vim:
 1 I want to 1 2 +-- 2 lines: * Jump over ......... 3 * to here 4 * without overshoot 
 But in emacs:
 1 I want to 1 2 * Jump over... 4 * to here 5 * without overshoot 
 In vim, 3j takes me where I want. In emacs, C-u 4 C-n, as hinted by the numbering, results in overshoot.
 From my search (e.g. here https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6i8nu3/question_for_evilmode_users_folding_and_relative/) the vim behavior has not been possible in emacs. Is this still the case?
 This type of movement is very fundamental for my workflow, especially when programming with my voice (being able to say "one four dip just" to delete 14 lines down, for example).
 Is there any way to achieve equally efficient vertical movement in emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I currently maintain my SQL notes (for example) in a .txt file. (Yes, I'm on Windows).
 For this, I manually maintain a TOC on top of the file. Actually this is more like an index, because it is sorted alphabetically. Each title is followed by some sort of unique code, that links to the actual note further in the same .txt file. When I need to lookup something, I lookup the topic in the TOC, select the unique code it and then do a find for that code. This is indeed a primitive system, but it works with any text editor.
 But lately I discovered (Doom) emacs and org-mode and I want to move my notes to emacs. I'd like to auto generate the TOC and sort it alphabetically. I found the package toc-org but as far as can see the TOC is not sorted. 
 How do you keep notes and navigate to in org mode ? (I'm a newbie so this could be a silly question)
 Thanks for your input !

 I wanted to create a custom function to insert picture with a pre-filled directory.
 First, I ran counsel-describe-bindings to see what C-c C-l invokes. When I found out it is the org-insert-link function, I tried to look at its documentation via counsel-describe-function. My initial guess was that you can invoke it via a prefix. But no luck.
 After some Googling around, I found out that you need to use the read-file-name function. However, when I tried to find this function in the org-insert-link source code, it is not there. So my question is how can I make this connection?
 Do I have to just try my luck and search for something remotely relatable to what I'm looking for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately I've been test driving Fedora Silverblue, an emerging distribution where the root filesystem is read-only and everything is done with Flatpaks and containers. So far it's pretty cool.
 If you aren't familiar with toolbox it's a nice wrapper around Podman that makes working with ad-hoc containers super easy.
 I have emacs in a flatpak and a toolbox with my C development environment installed. My goal was to hook them together so that I could use Eglot to develop C programs like I normally do.
 There's the docker-tramp project but this didn't work right for me... not sure what the issue was. The wonderful emacs wiki has a page on Tramp and Docker with some example code. So, I took it and modified it to use toolbox:
 (push (cons "toolbox" '((tramp-login-program "flatpak-spawn --host toolbox") (tramp-login-args (("enter" "-c") ("%h"))) (tramp-remote-shell "/bin/sh") (tramp-remote-shell-args ("-i") ("-c")))) tramp-methods) 
 Now I can C-x C-f /toolbox:fedora-toolbox-34: and open any file from inside the toolbox environment. I installed ccls in the toolbox and then Eglot was up and running. How about vterm-toggle? Like a charm... dropped me directly into a shell. Super cool.
 It seems like a few flaming hoops to jump through, and it's not a wrong assessment either. But when it's all working it's completely transparent and quite amazing, considering that Emacs and the development tools are running in different containers. Neat!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 Just started a new job doing support for a cybersecurity firm, and there is a ton of log searching involved.
 Basically, I'll have to rip through logs to figure out what certain parameters exist in a client's environment based upon a support packet that they send.
 This involves Docker, Ansible, Python 3, CentOS, etc.
 My last job involved examining logs sometimes but not all the time, so naturally I used Emacs via Swiper. I never did really get to the point where I felt comfortable looking through logs though. I would often use "Ediff" to compare two files, and take screenshots for Zendesk, but nothing too fancy.
 This time around though, its a bit more involved so I'm asking for some Emacs Wizards to help me find some suitable new packages to pump my config with.
 This being noted, I have to use GCP (Google Cloud Provider) to then SSH into a related sandbox environment. On that note, can Tramp be used in that scenario to make those two hops (aka to a GCP box, and then to an ssh box?)
 ​
 For the main topic though, does anyone have any good ideas on any packages that are great at grepping through a bunch of logs, and also how to re-direct anything that's found into separate files? 
 ​
 So far though, I've been able to connect through 'ansi-term' just fine but would love to somehow take that same terminal connection and do some more crazy Emacs stuff with it. 
 ​
 Very curious to see what people have in mind. The only thing I could think of is to maybe use Sunrise Commander instead of Dired :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subj. I swear it used to work? Basically upon launching, emacs adjusts to whatever monitor is set as the main one and becomes blurry if you drag it to another monitor. The issue exists on both 27.2 (downloaded from GNU ftp) and compiled master from like 10 days ago or so. Also, emacs only ever launches on the main monitor, it doesn't remember the last monitor it was used on as most other apps.
 Is there a way to make at least scaling work properly again? I don't think emacs ever remembered the monitor it was last open on. Pls don't suggest wsl emacs, I need native one 
 UPD: I just realized that emacs.exe (the one that opens both window and a terminal) is blurry on one monitor and good on the other one, and runemacs.exe is vise versa - it's blurry on the monitor where emacs.exe is not blurry, and it's crystal clear on the monitor where emacs.exe is blurry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone
 I'm sort of a Haskell noob, and I'm writing my thesis in Haskell. This is the first "real" project I've ever done so please bear with me if I sound stupid.
 Anyway, I'm almost at the end of the project. I have a function that opens a file, does some things to it, and then returns a result. I'm working with about 500000 files, so I thought I'd add parallelism to speed it up. I read some about parallelism in Haskell but still don't understand it very well. However, that's not important.
 My original sequential routine looks like this:
 openGetListResults :: [String] -> IO String openGetListResults [] = do return "" openGetListResults (p:rest) = do resP <- openGetProgramResult p resL <- openGetListResults rest return (resP ++ resL) 
 It works fine.I found the Control.Monad.Parallel module online and thought I could use it to speed it up. I came up with the following:
 pOpenExecuteListPrograms :: [String] -> IO [String] pOpenExecuteListPrograms l = do list <- P.mapM openGetProgramResult l return list 
 I know the return types are different but that doesn't really matter right now. The parallel version also works fine.
 I compiled the program with -threaded and -O2. I ran it with +RTS -N -s for both versions and got the following results.
 For the parallel version:
 Parallel version
 For the sequential version
 sequential version
 So the parallel version is way faster. However, it did not start any sparks. My understanding from Haskell parallelism is that sparks are like mini threads, so if it's doing parallel work, it should be using sparks no?
 Could anyone explain what is happening here? Thank you so much, hope this kind of question is allowed.

 Edit: Wrong link for Monad.Parallel

 It appears that sbt creates a second JAR (app_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) for some reason.
 Which file or files am I missing?

 The link at the top of page here, references the github repo : https://github.com/WebFreak001/code-debug which isnt the same thing as installed by vscode or by running dap-gdb-lldb-setup . Indeed this link points to a codebase using .ts files in different locations to the VSCode extension installed .js files. (I did set up the dap program/path variables to use the .ts files but that didnt work)
 (Side note : Debian doesnt ship with lldb-mi which is required for the lldb portion to work so I compiled that from source but still no joy. )
 Anway, before I go any further, does anyone have the "Native" working with gdb or lldb to debug C++? If so, then I can chalk it up to me doing something wrong and try to correct it and will provide more details.

 I do set up c-q to tell exwm next key will be send directly to other applications with exwm-input-send-next-key.

 I've been struggling with capturing web pages with org-roam on Firefox: it doesn't respect any template (so goes in the root folder)
 I added the bookmark with the following:
 javascript:location.href = 'org-protocol://roam-ref?r=i&ref=' + encodeURIComponent(location.href) + '&title=' + encodeURIComponent(document.title) + '&body=' + encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection()) 
 And my template is : 
 (setq org-roam-capture-templates ... ("i" "internet" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point) :file-name "float/%<%Y%m%d%H%M>-${slug}" :head "#+title: ${title}\n#+roam_key: ${ref}%?" :unnarrowed t) .... ) 
 I would like to be able to use the extension ; https://github.com/sprig/org-capture-extension but I don't think it's possible, I like having the ability to select text and capture it directly in emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 In the last years I learnt Elm and Idris and now I am evaluating Purescript for the somewhat complex long project of creating a minimalistic programming language with its respective IDE and compiler. I would like to know your general opinions in how does compare PS with Elm and Idris for complex projects, specially whether it is worth for the mid long run (for example a small SPA might be done faster and easier with Elm).
 In one hand I felt Elm does an awesome job at the time of reducing the boilerplate and go to the point, however Evan’s focus is not always to keep a consistent programming language and I am afraid I would lack some abstractions at some point.
 Regarding Idris, it is totally the opposite direction from Elm, the compiler is immature and Idris 2 is just not ready. I like from dependent types that we can make a type dependent on a single attribute such as Matrixes with its dimensions and let the compiler verify that at compile time, however all that becomes messy when trying something beyond trivial examples. I believe that by using higher order types with purescript that’s possible as well, but I couldn’t find yet a working example (perhaps I should just try).
 Last but not least, a big missing in all the ML family is somewhat logic programming (or prolog dialect), so being not many kanrens for any of those I would believe all three are even in this aspect.

 I want to share a small library I just published with you. Its called delegate-macro.
 It is a macro annotation to automatically delegate/proxy the implementation of an interface to a dependency. It has been super helpful to me when I have had to implement the "delegate pattern" for an interface with dozens of methods.Maybe you will also find it useful.
 I developed against Scala 2.
 edit:
 As u/agilesteel kindly pointed out below, unlike Scala2, Scala 3 has constructs to allow for this behaviour natively.

 ​
 I've got a mixed-language org-mode file that I use for pre-processing some data, and in the name of reproducibility (and portability), I'd like to be able to also run this pre-processing from outside of Emacs. My first thought was to add the `:tangle` argument to every code-chunk, then add a bash language chunk somewhere, set it up so that it fires off all of the tangle outputs in the correct order, and then instruct users to run the tangle output of said bash chunk.
 ​
 I don't like the degree of intervention that this requires though, since I imagine this will get annoying to maintain as I add more and more chunks to this file. Wondering if anybody has any wisdom on how to accomplish this.

 What is missing or I haven't found so, "80 column hard restriction" ...means , when I do type till 80 chanracter it will autometically move to next line.
 Can you people , shed some light , probably with some "actual code snippet". That would be nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use an org-mode table with elisp formula containing a literal string like $s. But the $s seems to be interpreted as an org-mode constant. 
 Is there a nice way to "escape" this kind of behaviour?
 simple example
 Works
 #+begin_src elisp (format "(%2$s - %1$s) / %1$s" "x_1" "x_2") #+end_src #+RESULTS: : (x_2 - x_1) / x_1 
 Problem
 | fails | #ERROR | | works | (x_2 - x_1) / x_1 | #+TBLFM: @1$2='(format "(%2$s - %1$s) / %1$s" "x_1" "x_2")::@2$2='(format "(%s - %s) / %s" "x_2" "x_1" "x_1") 
 simpler example
 Works
 #+begin_src elisp (format "$s") #+end_src #+RESULTS: : $s 
 Problem
 | fails | #UNDEFINED_NAME | #+TBLFM: @1$2='(format "$s") 
 It seems that $s is trying to be expanded as a constant (even though it is in quotation marks - which could be useful in some cases, but causes problems here).

 A coworker is non-technical, but wants to clear things out regardless of the status. Getting them to use emacs will be beyond painful. We have a few SOPs and and excel file that we track. The person likes to take the shop as a grain of salt and customizes it. A hurdle my supervisor is dealing with. I have to fix the excel file a few times a month due to errors, so I fear the same if a spin up a new one.
 Any thoughts about what I can suggest?

 The code uses (kill-buffer buffer) when processing is done and if the file is already open I get a prompt, but I don't want that to happen because the script is supposed to be non-interactive and should avoid killing existing buffer.
 How do I check if the file is already open to avoid killing its buffer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry to post again about this in such a short interval, but I'm hiring another Haskell dev for my team at Standard Chartered bank, this time in Singapore or Hong Kong.
 My team sits in front office and has about 20 Haskell devs (well, technically Mu, our in-house variant). We work in close collaboration with trading, sales, and structuring to build diverse software, from desktop GUI applications to server-side financial analytics reports and services. The current roles are at a relatively junior level -- 2 to 5 years industrial experience expected, or a relevant PhD.
 Feel free to reach out to me directly if you're interested and have any questions, but applications should go via the links below. To apply to the Singapore role go here: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100014272
 Or for Hong Kong: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100014571
 And the London role I posted before is still open: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100012204
 Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll. We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful applicants.

 same on cabal.
 i don't really know what else to do, readme don't give a lot of troubleshooting steps, wiki is even worst.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I'm trying to change the background color for the gui version and would like it to use the same theme as my terminal (Alacritty).
 To do this I added:
 (set-background-color "#030c11")
 Keep in mind that I have only recently started using emacs and I don't know lisp much.
 Now when I open Emacs in my terminal (emacs -nw) the background color is not the intended one (#030c11) but the default one of the wombat theme which is grey. Emacs gui on the other hand displays my custom theme correctly.
 To work around this problem and have both versions with the same theme I configured my init.el in the following way:
 ```
 (load-theme 'wombat)
 (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(background-color . "0x030c11"))
 (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(foreground-color . "0xd3d0c8"))
 (set-background-color "#030c11")
 ```
 I don't know why but it's the only way to display the same background. After opening the gui version, the flip side of this is the following error reported below the mode line: undefined color: "undefined". It's not so annoying and it disappears after the first input but I'd like to fix it.
 Do you know how can I solve the theme conflict between the two versions or how to remove the error message as a work-around?
 My init.el: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/jMDvYrTwNK/
 Thanks in advance!

 I know the keycodes. So the loadkeys part under Linux is ok. 
 I followed the articles on EmacsWiki. It helped me setup the various keys that otherwise are not available. (loadkeys in Linux then input-decode-modmap in Emacs)
 But Super and Hyper are modifiers, not full key sequences. So I don't know what to do next. 
 There is something about C-x@ in Emacs but I can't find definitive information about that. 
 Any help appreciated
 Notes: * I am not talking about X terminals. * I am not asking about GUI version. * This is about emacs -nw on Linux tty console.

 I setup company-mode and it's background color was similar to my theme's color. So I wanted to change the background. I installed company-box with :
 (use-package company-box
 :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))
 But when I did that company mode changed it's color to white.

 ​
 I tried all the methods but couldn't figure out a way to change it's background color. None of the answers worked for me.
 I also want to change font and it's color.

https://thesweetsetup.com/the-art-of-note-making/
If anyone does read through it and his examples, or if anyone has read some of the "Linking your Thinking" materials, do you consider his term "Map of Content" to be the same (or perhaps similar but not exactly the same) as the way the term "Structure Note" is often used in this forum?
I like the distinction Mike Schmitz makes between:
Things I may need to reference
Tasks I will need to do
Ideas I want to develop
and also his comments on deciding what goes into his ZK versus what does not.]]></summary>

My research area is machine learning. My first zettel was 02/23/2020 and most of them focus on my research area or research in general. Throughout my life I have read many books, but I remember little about them. For instance, I say books like "The Double Helix" or "The Art of Learning" made a big impact on me, but outside of a few anecdotes, I remember nothing. More than that, I have no notes to go back and refer to.  My plan this year was to change this and systematically process any book I read.
The first book happened to be "Team of Rivals". My first zettel was on 02/06/2021. At the time I had approximately 430 zettels.
The Process
I know little about Lincoln or the Civil War outside of what I remember from high school. Everything was new and everything seemed notable. As I …]]></summary>

 This one is for the users of org-super-agenda. I have some views defined as follows:
 (use-package! org-super-agenda :after org-agenda :init (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '( ("T" "triage" ((todo "" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "") (org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Triaged tasks" :tag "triage" :order 0) (:name "Confirmed" :discard (:anything t) :order 1))))))) ("A" "agenda" ((agenda "" ((org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Closed" :log t :order 5) (:name "Deadlines" :deadline future :order 3) (:name "Agenda" :time-grid t :order 0) (:name "Chores/Habits" :habit t :order 4) (:name "Important tasks" :priority "A" :order 1) (:name "Other tasks" :priority<= "B" :order 2))))))))) :config (org-super-agenda-mode)) 
 The first is to see tasks which are tagged :triage:, and the second for my agenda. The "agenda" view works very well. However, here's the issue. In the "triage" view, I can only see one task! If I mark that as done, I see another one. I don't understand why I can only see one task at a time. Any idea why? Any tips/suggestions are greatly appreciated. Cheers !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am an evil user. I was dissatisfied with evils jumping mechanism because I couldn't figure out how to control what commands set jump points, and therefore couldn't get my jumping to feel predictable. I thought I would share what I have come up with because it is working very nicely for me. 
 Please check out better-jumper.
 (use-package better-jumper :custom ; this is the key to avoiding conflict with evils jumping stuff (better-jumper-use-evil-jump-advice nil) :config (better-jumper-mode 1) ; this lets me toggle between two points. (adapted from evil-jump-backward-swap) (evil-define-motion better-jumper-toggle (count) (let ((pnt (point))) (better-jumper-jump-backward) (better-jumper-set-jump pnt))) ; this is the key here. This advice makes it so you only set a jump point ; if you move more than one line with whatever command you call. For example ; if you add this advice around evil-next-line, you will set a jump point ; if you do 10 j, but not if you just hit j. I did not write this code, I ; I found it a while back and updated it to work with better-jumper. (defun my-jump-advice (oldfun &rest args) (let ((old-pos (point))) (apply oldfun args) (when (> (abs (- (line-number-at-pos old-pos) (line-number-at-pos (point)))) 1) (save-excursion (goto-char old-pos) (better-jumper-set-jump))))) ; jump scenarios (advice-add 'evil-next-line :around #'my-jump-advice) (advice-add 'evil-previous-line :around #'my-jump-advice) (advice-add 'helm-swoop :around #'my-jump-advice) (advice-add 'evil-goto-definition :around #'my-jump-advice) (advice-add 'evil-goto-mark :around #'my-jump-advice)) ; ... whenever you want a new jump scenario just use the above pattern. 
 From here just add keybindings for better-jumper-toggle, better-jumper-jump-forward, and better-jumper-jump-backward.
 If you have ways to improve this let me know.
 Hopefully somebody can get some use out of this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm very much an Emacs noob so please excuse my basic understanding of this. Not a computer science guy, but also trying to learn Linux at the same time.
 I'm trying to configure Emacs for python development. All of the lsp and development environment tools are installed and working fine, my question is about code execution. 
 I want to write to bash (Konsole?) and ask it to interpret the .py file. I know I can use M-x shell, but I have seen online that this invokes a "subshell" within Emacs. My worry is that any python I run through this subshell is limited to a single CPU as Emacs is not multithreaded, and my python project needs all of the compute resource available. 
 Does that concern even make sense? Should I looks towards using M-x term instead? Apologies if not enough info, would be happy to clarify anything you want to know, just not sure what's relevant.
 tl;dr 
 Can I execute python files while in Emacs without having the execution be limited to a single CPU due to Emacs' lack of multithreading?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wonder if there is a simple solution to have a UI to navigate packages information with straight.el. It is mentioned in the README from straight that
  
any UI is provided by the user's completing-read framework
  
I would love to see examples of it ! (or build it myself)
 ​
 I tried something myself using marginalia and the metadata provided by package.el. I added this to to my init to associate the recipe keyword with package annotation :
 (add-to-list 'marginalia-prompt-categories '("\\<recipe\\>" . package)) 
 But I also have to (package-initialize) somewhere in my init since marginalia-annotate-package relies on package-alist and package-archive-contents. 
 ​
 Of course its a far from ideal solution. It doesn't work for all recipes, relies on package.el and doesn't inform about the current status of installed packages. For a proper solution, I think one could reuse part of the mechanism package.el uses to get packages information like package-load-descriptor, combine it with information from straight and finally add information provided by git for each repo.
 ​
 Does anyone know about packages or obscure init files that go in this direction ?

 First, I'm far from a soccer fan and most probably won't watch a single game within the upcoming weeks.
 However, for small-talk and event organization reasons, it's handy to have the games on my agenda.
 I converted the game schedule to Org mode format, assuming two hours per game. Since there might be a few Orgers out there who could profit from this task, you might want to check out https://pad.graz.social/p/EUROrg2020 and even maintain the schedule after the group stage where there are placeholders for now. The pad is writeable to everybody.
 If somebody should mess up pad content somehow, please use the timeslider button on the upper right corner (the fifth icon from right) to get back to the previous versions.
 Have fun

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to setup dap for my c/c++ project. So i created a bare minimal c test project that i compiled it like this:
 clang -o main main.c 
 I installed dap and lsp like this in my init.el:
  (setq dap-lldb-debug-program '("/usr/bin/lldb-vscode")) (straight-use-package 'dap-mode) (use-package lsp-mode :init ;; set prefix for lsp-command-keymap (few alternatives - "C-l", "C-c l") (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l") (setq dap-auto-configure-features '(sessions locals controls tooltip)) (setq dap-print-io t) :hook ((c-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :hook ((c++-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :straight (lsp-mode :type git :host github :repo "emacs-lsp/lsp-mode") :bind (:map global-map ("C-c d" . dap-debug)) :config (require 'dap-lldb)) (require 'lsp-mode) (setq lsp-ui-doc-enable t) (straight-use-package 'lsp-ui) 
 I set breakpoints in lines: 5, 11, 13 of sample project. Also created a file called: launch.json.
 And also generated a file called compile_commands.json with this command:
 clang++ -MJ main.o.json -Wall -std=c++11 -o main.o -c main.c 
 And start debugging with dap-debug and select my own configuration template(Test dap-lldb).
 The application runs without stopping at breakpoints.(Though it generates weird output) I just see the output message that print numbers.
 Am i missing some configurations?
 Edit: I've noticed that when start lsp_server and dap_server, some files generate automatically. like: *clangd::stderr* Or *Flaymake log*

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found a post by Sacha Chua about how she used Org to manage her grocery lists, and I want to do something sort of similar. I have an org file with recipes as headings, and immediately beneath each heading is the ingredients list as a table, followed by a list of instructions. I want to go through each week and pick an arbitrary number of recipes to cook by toggling a todo state on the heading. I want to write a function to concatenate all of the ingredients tables from the recipes I select for the week. I think I want to do something like this:
 (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer 'element) 'table (lambda (table) (when (string= (org-element-property :status table) "MAKE") ...code to concat table...))) 
 The missing piece with this idea is that I don't want to set a table property manually, but I also don't know how to set a property on a table based on the parent heading's todo state. Todo state triggers weren't meant for this it seems. I'm reading the documentation of course, but it's a little slow-going and I'm not that familiar with all of Org's built-in functions that might help with something like this. And this might not even be a great approach! So does anyone have recommendations on things to investigate or an alternative approach?

 I was just wondering if anyone knows of a way to turn "---" whenever I write it in an org file into an em-dash automatically (—). It's a small thing but I'd appreciate it if anyone knows how to do this! Thank you.

 Remaining in the Coursera specialization is Parallel Programming, Spark, and a Capstone project.
 After I complete the specialization, I am wondering what to focus on next.
 I think I will take this course which will uses Akka.
 If I learn Akka through this course, should I then learn a Typelevel framework/ library like Cats? Or is it better to just focus on Akka? I know this depends on the employer, but unsure where to focus my energy after learning base Scala.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past, scientists have developed a number of impressive theories. In the case of Luhmann, we have a detailed picture of one of the crucial tools he used, this tool has been made very explicit to a degree that anyone can use it, and this tool is largely uncoupled from the individual knowledge and the cognitive skills of its users. For other scientific breakthroughs, some of them perhaps even more impressive than Luhmann's theories, we seem to know little about what methods led to these breakthroughs.
I wonder what we could develop from this perspective - what, if any, explicit, transferable methods and tools can we extract from the works of physicists, philosophers or mathematicians? How can we combine these tools with practices from the ZK universe?
As far as I know, most breakthrough ideas in science and elsewhere were made without the use of a ZK - so people have used other ways to create great ideas, and it would be foolish to narrow our view on ZK-based work only.
To me, in most of the forum discussions we have a dominant focus on "literature-driven" ZK work - people read, write zettels, enrich them with their own thoughts and link them to other zettels. On the other hand I suspect that a huge part of people's crucial relevant work in life is "problem-driven". I'm convinced that many writers in this forum use their ZKs for this purpose, but postings about how to start thinking about a topic, how to formulate problems, how to ask questions, how to generate ideas, how to discard approaches in the ZK framework seem to me underrepresented, given their importance for creative work.]]></summary>

 This is a pre-job post for an independently motivated, highly technical, and theoretical person or team to build a non-production or research implementation of the Ethereum proof of stake system (also known as eth2) in Scala 3.
 For context, I'm an Ethereum community member and investor. Recently, a world expert in Ethereum's proof of stake told me that it would be valuable if an independent party were to develop a non-production implementation of the eth2 spec to be used as a quality control mechanism against the four production clients that are live today.
 Please see the eth2 specs repo https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs
 As you can see from the specs repo, this would be a large and complicated project and also require ongoing work to keep your implementation up-to-date with …]]></summary>

 Now as I understand, the branch is merged into emacs master. So I compiled it today morning and it mostly works but I think some minor modes are broken because of emacs version changes (through no fault of native-comp).

 Is there a Emacs-27 branch with native-comp, that I can use without using emacs from master branch?

Although I'm quite happy with my workflow on my iMac I'm having a hard time making a good workflow for creating zettels on my iPad. That's why I'm looking for help.
I've been trying to populate some front matter on a new note using this iOS shortcut for iAWriter: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/05a688e941954398aafab768f75966fc. The shortcut adds a filename following the convention used by The Archive and adds title, date, and tags. The problem is that it works sometimes while fails most of the time for no apparent reason.
As you can see image 1 (sucessful-shortcut.png) shows how it looks when the shortcut properly works, and image 2 (fail-shortcut.png) shows when it fails.



Do you have any insight into what's happening? If you use iA Writer, is there another way to add a front matter to a new note on iPad (other than manually)?
A simple workflow is really important for me to work with The Archive and iA Writer on the iPad, so if you have figured this out I'd love to learn from you. Thank you, André.]]></summary>

 I guess I could make a script to update the links, but if anything is already done, that'd be awsome.

 I want to write a minor mode that does gradient highlighting on characters in org and nov mode (each character is a step on a gradient transition like https://www.beelinereader.com) efficiently. 
 How might you seasoned elisp-ers go about this? Is font-lock mode the right way to do it? Should I consider another way? Are there any guides you might recommend that would help me out on this journey?

 Lately I've noticed that I would have to use some of the Emacs keybinding even on evil mode and this is really annoying me, I was thinking that maybe if I learned Emacs keybindings it would've been much better.
 So my question is as the title says, and if anyone has good resources for learning Emacs keybindings for in case I end up going that way I would be very grateful.

I have a notes.tex with literature review.
 when I start writing I often put lots of comments about relating ideas and reference sources.

 Hyperbole stores a .hypb with the linking information.
 Any other ideas or alternatives?

Some of my random thoughts
Reading print is more time efficient in itself.
Saving time via the habit of reading digitally comes from more efficient workflows surrounding the pure reading (e.g. extracting your highlights all at once)
The faster you read the better is your comprehension if the reading speed comes natural and you don't overpush yourself by some (not working) speed reading techniques oder overestimating your abilities.]]></summary>

 I think the link explains the trouble. The compiler can't find implicit Writer for Thing, which makes sense, but I can't have Thing derive Writer since it's just a trait. What's the correct approach to solve this for Scala 3?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my company runs its own JIRA servers internally. I've been trying to get Org-JIRA to work today with no luck. I've looked at the solutions that other people used, but none of it has worked out for me yet. 
 (Namely: https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira/issues/21 and https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira/issues/186)
 I've noticed that if I use the constructed curl command with my username and password manually, I get what I *think* is a valid response. Otherwise, I see this X-AUSERNAME: anonymous in the messages. I tried creating a .authinfo file, but it changes nothing. Org-JIRA only asked my for my credentials once and never again.
 Internally, I use either a login/password or SSO to log in, but it doesn't look like our system has the same API token functionality that the Atlassian site does. I tried finding the cloud.session.token to use with the authorization workaround, but nothing that I did surfaced it. I'm not really a web guy, so I was just making some stabs in the dark.
 This is all on Windows; I'm not sure to what extent that makes a difference, but I've seen problems with that in the last few days in other packages. 
 Anyone else have anything else I can try?

Then it quickly morphed with, "What if there was more than one person I'd like to know how many times they were mentioned?

 I often end up with a lot of vim windows open that create a clutter. I also have a lot of projects to work on and I need some place to keep my notes for these and organize my tasks. I hear that managing such things with emacs should be easy with orgmode and that it should be able to match the text editing provided by vim.
 However most of the things I find are related to installing packages from the internet. At work I don't have the ability to install anything. For vim pluging i am able to copy the plugin and create the files manually. Is this possible to do in emacs? 
 Also any tips for switching to emacs? I feel a lot slower with emacs to switch and edit file even though I find things like file browsing directly from emacs is much nicer than what is in gvim.
 So can the vanilla emacs match gvim in terms of text editing, and are there any features which are possible in gvim but not in emacs?

Likewise Haskell, when you pick it up starts oozing mathematics. Most put it right back down. Here's a quote from a brilliant blogger here who is describing `head` and how it must accommodate the empty list:
  
If we have a list, we might very well want to get the first element in it. And indeed, the operation of “getting the first element of a list” isn’t impossible in Haskell, it just requires a little extra ceremony.
  
"Extra ceremony," indeed. So between Bird and de Moor's Algebra of Programming and these one-off blog posts is a scavenger hunt for the math behind Haskell. Certainly a beginner doesn't need any math to bust through one of the many starter tuto…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Orgers... :)
 In the org manual, "7.5.3 Capturing column view", in https://orgmode.org/manual/Capturing-column-view.html#Capturing-column-view says:
  
Since column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be exported or printed directly. If you want to capture a column view, use a ‘columnview’ dynamic block (see Dynamic Blocks). The frame of this block looks like this: 
 #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id "label" 
 #+END: 
 This dynamic block has the following parameters: 
 ‘:id’ - This is the most important parameter. Column view is a feature that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture block might be at a different location in the file. To identify the tree whose view to capture, you can use four values: 
 -- ‘local’ - Use the tree in which the capture block is located. 
 -- ‘global’ - Make a global view, including all headings in the file. 
 -- ‘file:FILENAME’ Run column view at the top of the FILENAME file. 
 -- ‘LABEL’ - Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property with the value LABEL. You can use M-x org-id-copy to create a globally unique ID for the current entry and copy it to the kill-ring.
  
Since the option for ‘LABEL’ says, "Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property...", my question is: how do you capture a column view that is in the same file, but another tree?
 For example
  
chapter 
 subtitle
 another subtitle that tries to capture the tree with logs
 
 another chapter 
 tree with logs (that can be seen as column-view)
 
  
As always, thank you very much for your generous help, time and attention... :)
 Best regards...

I recently created a theme for The Archive to suit my personal needs and I thought I'd publish it, in case somebody else finds it handy too:

I'd describe it as minimalist, high-contrast and equally suited for writing and coding (I store many code snippets in my Zettelkasten).
You can find it on Github: https://github.com/stephanbogner/the-coding-writer-theme
I also stumbled upon the "The Archive Userland Themes"-repository, so if there is any interest to add my theme to that, that would be cool too

But, there continues to be one lingering concern... that I am just collecting and not making any real use of my notes.
I do my best to take quick notes while reading, putting them into my own words before adding these ideas to my slip box and expanding on them... but even after that, it still feels like I am just creating collection of other people ideas.
This leads me to ask two questions. First, what are some strategies that you use to combat this? And, second is this sort of feeling fairly common as your system grows?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my init.el I need to define several functions that will return cons cells and the returned CDR depends on an argument to the function, like this:
 (defun foo1 (x) `(symbol1 . ,(+ 1 x))) (defun foo2 (x) `(symbol2 . ,(+ 1 x))) 
 (Context: I am defining several similar "style dispatchers" for orderless. My actual functions are a bit more complicated than this, but have a common structure.)
 I would like define a macro to build these functions for me. The naive thing to try is this:
 (defmacro build-it-1 (name symbol) `(defun ,name (x) `(,symbol . ,(+ 1 x)))) 
 But this gives
 (macroexpand '(build-it-1 foo1 sym1)) (defalias 'foo1 #'(lambda (x) `(,symbol \, (+ 1 x)))) 
 Oh, so the "inner" backquote control ,symbol and there is nothing to expand there.
 (But the \, is weird. What happened to my cons cell?)
 So, let's try this for the sake of the symbol:
 (defmacro build-it-2 (name symbol) `(defun ,name (x) ,`(symbol . ,(+ 1 x)))) (macroexpand '(build-it-2 foo1 sym1)) *** Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable x) 
 OK. Now the symbol x is unquoted by the comma we just moved, so, uh, maybe this?
 (defmacro build-it-3 (name symbol) `(defun ,name (x) ,`(symbol . ,(+ 1 'x)))) (macroexpand '(build-it-3 foo1 sym1)) *** Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p x) 
 Hmm. Elisp didn't like that.
 I suspect that it is possible to do what I want with some combination of comma, backquote, and quote. I've tried (more or less at random) various strings like ,`(+ 1 x) and ',`(+ 1 x) but I can't get what I want.
 What am I doing wrong?

 From what I understand Haskell does not support this in the most general sense, I can't declare two functions of the same name. I can only do such a thing if I declare a typeclass, correct? Then I can in that class declare a function that can take a multitude of different parameters, depending on what I'd want? 
 Some clarity on this would be greatly appreciated! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[desktop-save-mode had caused me issues before because of different ways of starting Emacs :- command line "emacs", as a service ("systemctl --user enable Emacs") with the system starting it, as emacsclient (emacsclient -c ) or even from your own startup with something like "emacs --daemon". Anyway, this little snippet "works for me" and might be of interest to others. All self-contained in a use-package form. If starting as a daemon do the desktop read after the first frame is created, else do it immediately after emacs-startup-hook is triggered. The only thing that scuppered me a little was not checking the supplied emacs.service systemd config - it hardcodes the Emacs path, starting the wrong Emacs version and causing straight.el to recompile everything on startup : solution to that is copying /usr/lib/systemd/user/emacs.service to ~/.config/systemd/user and altering the paths to your own Emacs version (Debian paths there).
 The settings of desktop-save and desktop-path in combination with needing a desktop-read call are, on observation, what caused much confusion out there in google land. 
 Maybe not news to many, but I thought I'd share the snippet as googling showed it's still an issue for some.
 ​
  (use-package emacs :custom (desktop-path '("~/.emacs.d/var/desktop")) (desktop-save t) :init (defun rgr/restore-desktop() (when (fboundp 'alert) (alert (message (format "loading desktop from %s" desktop-path)))) ;;I include the run-with-timer despite being able to get this to work without as it's a timing ;;issue and a little delay does no one any harm (run-at-time "1" nil (lambda() (desktop-read) (desktop-save-mode 1)))) (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda() (if (daemonp) (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook 'rgr/restore-desktop) (rgr/restore-desktop)))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total noob here but very dissatisfied with python as a language, dipped toe in clojure and Common Lisp waters but not doing it for me. Then I saw haskells partial application: let a = (1 +) and my mind was blown. Watched a few presentations and I’m convinced this is the language to learn. I gotta learn this language. It appears it’s not really a ‘step 1 = toy example first’ kinda language instead i need to study up and grasp a lot before using Haskell in real life problems. So any advice ahead of my journey to learn Haskell? I just realise there are so many expert haskellers here would love any advice that makes the journey as useful as possible. Do you think I should start with some basic tutorials then project Euler (or something similar)? Or better getter some great big book and reading all the theory first?

 Also, i should mention that in link that i provided it shows one more import
 import Network.HTTP.Client.TLS 
 that i had to remove cause it was throwing this error

 My question is how do i get this API-key that is required?
 (Im using cabal to run this, if it means anything)

 I forgot to include code, i also fixed some of the errors but i currently have "pattern match failure.." in line 13 (columns 11-57, which would be the whole line before "<-" part) and still nost sure about this api thing in line 15

 Anyways, I have been using company-mode for a while now, and it has worked perfectly for me. I recently switched to using evil mode and now when I type, the company mode box pops up, but it doesn't automatically put the cursor there. Instead I have to manually scroll down with C-n to get the a selection to the company mode box.
 I of course thought that it was an issue with evil mode, but nothing looks wrong to me. 
 Any suggestions of what could be the issue or any possible solution?

 The problem is if the share is not connected the files are created on the local hard disk instead of the network.
 Does Emacs have an option to check if a directory points to network share or a local directory?
 On Linux checking /etc/mtab is a possibility but I prefer something higher level that will work on Windows too.

 So what you have is a footnote with a citation in it, but also some text. Can you do this with org-ref?

The Render type class is used to render a value as text. Avoid bugs by only using Show for debugging/development purposes.
 
The Parse type class is used to parse a value from text. Unlike Read, it has support for error messages.
 
Validate constants at compile-time using Parse instances.

 * Task ** TODO This is the first line and this is the second line. 
 if it is possible to change both lines to green when I change the TODO to DONE. The syntax highlighting does not seem to carry over. If I add ** to the second line and change the TODO to DONE, it also does not seem to change it. I have searched online, but cannot find an answer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First some context:
As I understand Luhmann workflow...
He put every interesting thoughts he have as a permanent note without worrying too much. (Like a skeptic tank)
His notes are really short (generally 1 to 3 sentences).
I see nobody else using the Zettelkasten in this way. Lot of people create longer notes and try to synthesize before putting the ideas into the system.
Last but not least: the system is created for academic research in mind.
My frictions:
1) When I think and want to create new notes... having to search existing notes in the Zettelkasten stops my thinking flow.
I am wondering if it’s not better to just create note without connection when I think... and only then look at the possible connections. But that will create a lot of duplicates.
Or thinking more deeply before putting the note and find the connections. (But I feel I don’t leverage the Zettelkasten fully by this way)
2) When I want to create a new content... going to the Zettelkasten kills my creative flow. As I am not creating academic content (but marketing content)... The most important in the content isn’t the information, but the emotion (you can only put emotion in a content with your first brain in a specific mood)
Because of this 2 things... I am wondering if a Zettelkasten is the best tool for me.
And if it is... I am wondering why only luhmann work in a very atomic way without bothering of the quality of the note. And why mainy people create longer note with digital zettelkasten.
My question:
I deliberately don’t ask a specific question because at this point, I don’t really know what is the good question to ask myself.
Maybe: How to determine the best way of organizing the process and scope of permanent notes ?
Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to create a Mac installer for a project that uses the SDL2 library and a couple of extension libs.
 Currently when I build, things are linking against the libraries installed on my system via homebrew in /usr/local/opt/. However, when I package these libraries with my program they are not recognized as safe to run on others' systems, so in order to run my program a user has to go through a launch, crash, allow library to be run cycle for each of the libs I link against until everything is allowed. This is obviously a no-go from a user friendliness perspective.
 I figured if I could link against the Mac frameworks for the libs that they should be signed (as they've been released as frameworks) and the user would only have to go through this allow process for just my app executable (until I get it signed). However, I'm not sure how to link against the frameworks.
 I tried repointing the executable to the framework dylibs using the install_name_tool, but the versions differ between the homebrew and framework versions of the libs, which made my app not run -- I've since thought better of trying to use this method in case there were incompatibilities between the entry points of the lib versions.
 My next thought was that I would have to link to the frameworks at build-time, but adding the -framework ghc option when I run stack build doesn't seem to have any effect -- it still points to the homebrew versions. Maybe the Haskell bindings are set to point at the homebrew versions only?
 This is the first user-facing application I've developed on Mac, so I'm in a bit over my head. I'd like to have the standard DMG/drag-the-app-into-Applications installer for the app, as I don't know that homebrew would be the friendliest install method for my target audience.
 Any help or suggestions are appreciated!

 I would try to make sense of this myself, but I'm not quite proficient enough in Emacs yet.

 I just released a new chapter focusing on IO in my online course Foundations of FP in Scala https://www.fp-tower.com/courses/foundations
  
Includes 16 videos, around 4.5 hours in total.
 Lots of exercises, including a very realistic one where we implement a search flight aggregator similar to skyscanner
 We’ll cover features such as by-name parameters, lazy evaluation, dependency injection, and concurrency.
 We’ll study the differences between IO and Future extensively. 
 This chapter is a perfect introduction to cats-effect, Monix and ZIO.
  
Let me know if you have any questions!

 I know there must be a nice way of doing this in Scala. Also, is this called a polymorphic method?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am an emacs beginner, and trying to do some C++ programming in emacs. I am having a lot of trouble to get tabs to work in emacs like I would expect them to work like in Sublime Text.
 This is how my code looks in emacs:
 std::cout<<"============cheem-scheme v.1============\n"; std::string source; while(true) { std::cout << ++line_number << "] cheem> "; std::getline(std::cin, source); Object* expr = read(source); Object* evaluated_expr = eval(expr, global_environment); std::cout << print(evaluated_expr) << std::endl; } return 0; 
 And this is how it looks like when I open it in another text editor:
 std::cout<<"============cheem-scheme v.1============\n"; std::string source; while(true){ std::cout << ++line_number << "] cheem> "; std::getline(std::cin, source); Object* expr = read(source); Object* evaluated_expr = eval(expr, global_environment); std::cout << print(evaluated_expr) << std::endl; } return 0; 
 emacs seems to be inserting only one tab for even indentation that goes more than a level deep, and that is pretty frustrating to work with. I would rather emacs insert n tabs for n levels of indentation. How am I supposed to change this behavior?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm embedding images in org-mode using org-download, which saves the captured image that is in the clipboard, inserts the path as text in the org file, and then display the image inline. This works fine. [[file:.images/morepathstuff:/2021-04-12_04-44-34_screenshot.png]]
 But I can't copy the image out, without drawing a rectangle around the image with a screen capture tool like flameshot. I can only copy the emacs image file path as shown above.
 How can I copy the image itself into the clipboard, and not just the emacs image file path? 
  
I'm do not want to use a file manager, find the image, and copy it, as file names are often long and un-intelligble, and I can have many images in one directory.
 I guess the preferred method would be some elisp function where I highlight an inline image (to select/highlight the path), and then it copies that path, interprets that path, finds the image, and copies the image itself into my clipboard. But I don't think that exists yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a very keyboard-centric person, however sometimes I still like to use the mouse to scroll down certain files in emacs (usually docs and the like). Plus, I don't really like scrolling line by line, so I've been trying to have emacs scroll smoothly.
 Sadly, I've found the emacs smooth scrolling experience to be janky at best: no matter what workarounds I use (I've tried several, including all of those listed on the emacswiki page as well as good-scroll.el), smooth scrolling feels sluggish, not fluid, and often unresponsive.
 I wonder what the root cause for this is. Most of the explanations I've read revolve around emacs' lack of animation support. For example, the github page of smooth-scroll.el states the following:
  
Scrolling sometimes pauses or stutters. It's unclear exactly why, but one factor is that Emacs lacks animation support. Emacs has timers for updating the screen contents, which is enough for playing simple animated GIF files, but not enough for video playback or frame-perfect smooth scrolling.
  
My question is the following: what would it take to fix it? I know that emacs is very old, and some features might just be outside of its capabilities (at least for now). Is smooth scrolling support one such feature?
 I understand that emacs wasn't made with smooth scrolling in mind, and I don't mean to criticize and/or diminish the amazing work that went into it. I'm extremely happy with my emacs experience--smooth scrolling would just be the icing on the cake.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started using vertico, marginalia and embark together, and it's been great. I like that they're relatively light weight.
 I've used helm for a long time, and it's honestly very good, but I'm mostly only using it for its locate functionality now. I use everything search on windows, which in combination with the .dir-locals.el lets me set a search instance depending on the directory I start the search from. I know about projectile, of course, but it's slower and more finicky than everything. (With everything, I can set up a search that spans many directories on many drives and make it a named instance, and then just query the named instance in the arguments.)
 Helm's locate is the only decent and maintained way to do this that I've found. Scrounging up random .el files from EmacsWiki doesn't really work for me.
 If there isn't, no big deal. I'll keep helm updated.

 (evil-global-set-key 'normal "t" 'evil-snipe-s)
 (evil-global-set-key 'normal "s" 'evil-substitute)
 (evil-global-set-key 'normal "T" 'evil-snipe-S)
 evil-snipe-s/S seems to work, but evil-substitute does not, pressing s still invokes evil-snipe-s, I imagine I might need to remove the old key binding in order to do that, but I don't know how

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Haskell beginner here: Is it good practice to mix both let and where bindings in a function definition?
 For example (with short being a short function and reallyLongFunc being a really long function):
 foo x = let short y = y * 2 in if odd x then short x else reallyLongFunc x where reallyLongFunc z = z + 2 
 Using let at the top and where at the bottom allows me to arrange the function definitions next to where they are used, and allows large function definitions to not interrupt the logical flow of the program. However, I could also understand that it might be bad practice to use both let and where, because I have not seen this done anywhere, and it might be mixing expression and declaration styles.
 What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I’m a professional Golang developer. I previous worked with Java for 10 years and Python for a few years as well.
 I tried to learn Haskell back in 2016 with the book “Real World Haskell. But I found the book to be really dry and frankly boring. It was a struggle to get through. And after about 8 chapters I saw very little “real world”.
 I find that most education material seems to run all examples in the repl. And that is just off putting to me. Especially when I see “real world” apps and I can’t understand what’s going on.
 Also I find that too many tutorials focus way too much on math problems. And that’s cool. But how do I get from math problems to building entire apps. To me there doesn’t seem to be any real progression.
 I know plenty of languages and I found I learn better by trying to build real things. Yet I find most Haskell tutorials and education shy away from showing real world applications. And reading source code is confusing since it’s hard to distinguish between built in functions and user defined functions.
 Anyway is there a middle ground between these heavily mathematical examples. And actual real world application. There seems to be a lot of ceremony in real world Haskell apps.
 I do enjoy the Haskell type system. And I like it’s expressiveness. I wish I could enjoy it like others do. I just have never got that “aha” moment because it’s hard to just jump in and get dirty with the language.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've finally gotten around to work on some updates for this package. The new version is on melpa, but I won't put it on melpa-stable yet until it has been tested by more people. Noteworthy new features are:
  
the package now filters remote content from html emails to address issues with tracking in emails. This is currently quite naive, but users can customize filters. Any feedback / help from somebody who understands email tracking better than I do is appreciated.
 the new dispatcher view method determines how to show emails based on a set of customizable rules (e.g., you could use this to show remote content for trusted email addresses)
 you can now temporarily redisplay the current email using a different viewing method. For instance, to switch from filtering remote content for an email to showing remote content.

 Where | is point, then the minibuffer shows "foo/bar/baz".
 That gets annoying for long paths because the minibuffer resizes to fit multiple lines and such.

However, I'm relatively new to the FFI (and Haskell in general), so I'm running into various build issues.
 I'm looking for someone with a bit of experience to chat with about the package: https://github.com/femtomc/mlir-hs
 In particular, I'm getting linking failures when I build now -- so I'm trying to communicate the correct information to `stack` so that it can find the C headers, etc. 
 Other random questions: is it possible to bundle this up so that Nix can manage the LLVM/MLIR dependency/versioning? If yes -- and someone is aware of reading material, I'd love to take a look and learn how to do this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've been working on bespoke-themes, which started out as a fork of Nicolas Rougier’s amazing work on elegant-emacs and nano-emacs. It sports a similar vibe, though some of the base colors are different and it is slightly less minimal and "opinionated" than nano-emacs. It also has the benefit of being (I hope) easily incorporated into one's existing emacs as a theme, rather than the more "distro" style of nano-emacs (which is a great project, but maybe not for everyone). I'm hoping to submit it to MELPA before too long. Long story short though, I'm looking for advice on the following:
  
Organization of the theme files
 Elisp (I'm not any sort of programmer) 
 Whether I should break the mode line out into its own repo
 Any useful tips on colors (that you hate/like it is one thing -- I'm more curious about tips concerning visibility or contrast, etc.)
 Stuff to do before I submit it to MELPA (especially anything not covered by the README)
  
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a book using org-mode and I'm trying to export as an HTML/website, similar to this example. That was written using R and Bookdown, but since it all ends up as CSS/HTML, I don't see why the same thing can't be replicated with org-mode. 
 I've been trying to use org-publish to do this, but I'm running into a couple of issues. 
  
I can't seem to replicate the book structure of the above example -- it all comes out as one single long HTML file. I'm using separate files for each chapter, and then a main.org file where each chapter is included via #+INCLUDE statements. What is the best way to achieve this? In other words, I want a front page with a TOC, and then each chapter to be a separate page and to have previous and next links for navigation.
 
I've been using the org-ref package to cross-reference figures/tables/sections in the book, but it doesn't seem to work across multiple files. E.g. if I am in chapter 4 and I want to reference something in chapter 2 (using the label: and ref: keywords respectively), org-ref doesn't seem to recognize it. Any way around this?
 
Lastly, I'd very much appreciate any examples of books like this being made in org-mode and exported as HMTL/websites, for inspiration. Or "book-themed" CSS templates that can be implemented painlessly. The only one I'm aware of is the org-mode manual itself, but aesthetically it is very far from what I'm looking for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i have this assignment where i have to code a game called "Nim" where two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps or piles, and the player that gets to remove the last object wins. I've already coded a function for doing a specific move, i.e : play [1,2,3,4] (3,2) = [1,2,1,4]. [1,2,3,4] would be the number of objects on each tile, and (3,2) would be removing 2 objects from the third tile. I also coded a function that gives a list of all the posible plays on a specific board position, i.e: possiblePlays [1,2,3] = [(1,1), (2,2),(2,1),(3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] The problem i'm having is that now i have to code a function that tells me if a board position (like [1,2,3,4]) is "winnable": a board position is winnable if a play exists that can lead to the other player getting a not winnable board position. i.e: isItWinnable [] = False (because you can't make another move, so you lose) isItWinnable [1] = True (because you get to remove the last object). I think these could be the base cases, but i'm having a lot of trouble thinking the recursion. I'm sorry for the long post and the messy english, it's not my native language and i had to translate everything from spanish. If anyone has any ideas or tips it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

 What I am doing now is switching to emacs keybindings with C-z and then edit normally but when I am in an org file if I press TAB the headline gets moved to the right instead of folding or unfolding. 
 Anybody experiencing this?

 I think all of the below is correct, but if I'm missing or am wrong about anything please tell me in the comments and I'll correct the text.
 Unsurprisingly, all of this is well documented in (info "(elisp) Startup Summary") and (info "(emacs) Packages") so I'm not writing anything groundbreaking here, just summarizing available information.

 I basically have this code, the purpose of it is to find out if the structure I created is Correct. Basically the "Stein" has inside it all the other elements that are supposed to be above it. The "Dach" is the Roof and so it cannot take anything else above it. The correctness of the Structure is determined by the length of all the elements above a "Stein". So if it were that the total length of all elements above the "Stein" is smaller or equal to the Length of that "Stein" the Structure is considered Correct and true is given out. But I have no clue how I should continue from this point onwards. I have no clue how to verify the Length of all the structures above a "Stein" in such a way that still only Boolean comes out in the end.
 Edit: I did manage to come up with somewhat of a hacky solution to it which I am not really a fan of.
 correct :: Legu -> Bool correct x = 0 <= foldLegu (\ le _ l -> if le >= sum l && sum l >= 0 then le else -le) const x 
 Is there a more elegant way with which to do this, I am particularly not a fan of the fact I am simply giving out a negative number if the structure is not correct.

 There are three installation routes documented :- 
 1) as a secondary package manager
 2) using a seeded bootstrap
 3) using your own "from scratch" bootstrap
 ​
 I followed 3) since 2) meant cloning into my .emacs.d which is already a git repo and I didn't want to potentially screw that over. Anyway, some trial and error I have emacs starting up with borg and I have 5 or 6 things assimiliated in to .emacs.d/lib.
 But is it correct that things not in there are loaded from ~/.emacs.d/elpa? I ask this because I'm not sure how this is then different from "using borg as a secondary package manager". package-install still works installing to the elpa directory. This seems to make sense as there doesn't seem to be a way to auto magically auto assimilate (but being very new to this, there might be one I overlooked).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think it would be great if the Emacs documentation was more accessible on mobile devices, either for those long journeys when you need something interesting to read, or at night in bed when you want to do some light reading (heh).
 Idea 1: Treat each manual like an Ebook
 The easiest way to do this would be to convert the source Tex files used to generate the online documentation into an indexed EPUB format, using pandoc or other.
 We could then rely on existing Ebook readers to handle the formatting issues, bookmarking, and search queries.
 Edit -- /u/alraban points out that there exists already an epub resource:
 http://epub-manuals.ourproject.org/blog/gnu-emacs-lisp-reference-manual/
 Idea 2: Treat it like a Bible App
 Bible apps are awesome, they come with the all advantages of Ebook readers (formatting, bookmarking, annotation) with the added bonus that they bundle all related material under a single app.
 Given the diversity of Emacs-specific material in GNU this could be a great way to contain several different manuals, over several different versions of documentation (with optional 'diff' highlights), all in one place.
 There are a few FOSS bible app templates on github, but I'm not that versed in android development anymore so this is likely something I cannot do without a lot of effort. 
 Is there anyone in this sub who is versed in Android development and would be willing to evangelize the Emacs documentation on mobile? I'd be happy to chip in a few dozen coffee funds

one emacs instance for general notetaking and capturing, agenda and etc.
 one emacs instance for every project that I work (usually limited to 2, I am trying out projectile, but still prefer separate projects hacked away in separate emacs instances)
 one for org-noter for reading pdfs - one instance per pdf
  
I love the integrated computing environment idea, making everything seamlessly work together, I am still honing my config to achieve that, but for the moment separate instances workflow helps me get things done.
 I am thinking of exploiting chemacs in combination with .desktop files to launch emacs to specific tasks, but is there a better way to do this?
 EDIT:
 as u/sjchy pointed out,
 Visually differentiating workspace is vital for me. I didn't mention this in the OP. but I use leuven theme for general notetaking and solarized for projects and tango-dark for org-noter at the moment.

 I'm doing some series on C++ literate programming for numerical analysis and would like to create a session like workflow to avoid big code blocks.
 I tried to use :tangle and :includes header arguments but run in some inconveniences:
  
:tangle does not work if I try to save the file in a sub directory. OK, I can live with having all my files in a single directory.
 :includes when I try to include a file it only recognizes if I provide the absolute path. Which is also annoying.
  
Does anyone has experience with any of that?

 apparently ansi-term and term uses pop-to-buffer instead of switch-to-buffer so to make them obey display-buffer-alist need to set

 [T]he letter with the brackets around it is where the cursor is at 
 I start with this line, in a very narrow Emacs window. Note, it is a single line in the file, but two lines visually, because my editor is very narrow (for testing purposes).
 [T]his is a long line, it wraps. 
 Run evil-end-of-line ($):
 This is a long line, it wraps[.] 
 Run evil-previous-visual-line (gk):
 [] This is a long line, it wraps. 
 The problem here is that it didn't go to the previous visual line.
 However, evil-previous-visual-line (gk) does sometimes work. Consider:
 [T]his is a long line, it wraps. 
 Run evil-end-of-line ($):
 This is a long line, it wraps[.] 
 Run evil-backward-char (h), then run evil-forward-char (l):
 This is a long line, it wraps[.] 
 Now run evil-previous-visual-line (gk):
 This is[ ]a long line, it wraps. 
 Now evil-previous-line works as expected.
 This problem seems to come from mixing regular commands and visual line mode aware commands. Going directly from a non visual line aware command to a visual line aware command causes problems. But if I do evil-forward-char in between, everything works.
 Any suggestions on how I can fix this?

Ultimately I want to know and use both, but was wondering if there would be a benefit from learning one before the other.
 And, so I can be the first one to say it: 
 "Just learn both"
 - Yes, that's the plan. I want to know if it would be beneficial to learn one before the other.
 "That's comparing le apples to le oranges"
 - Yes, I am referring specifically to the text editor part of Emacs, and Vim, not Emacs as a whole to Vim
 "Emacs isn't a text editor dummy"
 - Yes, I know. I'm talking specifically about the text editor of Emacs, not Emacs as a whole.

 Surprisingly, using the nix build instructions from this snippet:
 https://gist.github.com/mjlbach/179cf58e1b6f5afcb9a99d4aaf54f549#gistcomment-3664894
 , I'm finally able to get emacsGcc working in my nixos machine running on a raspberry pi 4,
 when I open emacs, everything seems to load up fine, and emacs feels much more snappier, but the issue that I'm having now is with modes, for example: when I open an html file setup with (direnv+nix-direnv+emacs-direnv), the isolated environment does not load, and whenever I manually execute: M-x html-mode, emacs throws these 2 errors in emacs's messages buffer?
 Note: I enabled debugger, and on emacsGcc startup initialization, the debugger is not triggered, which is good, but these 2 errors still show up at the beginning of the messages buffer:
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2) [2 times]
 Error loading autoloads: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)
 This 3rd error shows up whenever I try to manually activate a specific mode:
 Error running timer: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)
 Also, in the async-native-compile-log buffer, I can see the different modes for my project being compiled, but even after the compilation of one of the modes that I need is completed, whenever I try to activate that mode, the same 2 errors from above are thrown?
 Any tips on how to fix this?
 I'm pretty sure that there's an easy fix, but I'm new to emacsGcc, so there's probably some things that I'm missing to get emacsGcc up and running.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

 I am mainly looking to get rid of rookie mistakes, not looking for some amazing heuristic to make my sudoku solver 200x faster. 
 It feels to me like there should be improvements I could make to the solve function, but I don't really know how or what to improve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consult is a collection of useful navigation and search commands based on completing-read, compatible with various completion UIs. Marginalia enhances completion commands with informative annotations in the minibuffer.
 Both packages have been submitted to GNU ELPA recently and became available there today. Hopefully some of the enhancements of these packages can be imported into Emacs proper, for example improved annotation functions, some of the completion commands or API improvements. 
 A while ago, the completing-read API has been enhanced with the group-function metadata, which allows completion UIs to group the set of candidates. This feature started as a Consult extension, which is used by the multi source consult-buffer command. Support for the group-function has been added to the default completion UI and merged into Emacs master.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm an absolute noob when it comes to emacs and org-mode. I've been watching a tonne of videos and reading through the manual.
 One thing that I'm wondering about is whether to use tags or custom properties for adding people to a task? The idea would be that if a task has a status of WAITING that I'd want to add the associated person to that task. Then when having a meeting with that person I'd be able to pull up a list of all the tasks that are associated with that person.
 In my current system (in Notion) I actually have a page per person, so that I can write some notes about them, such as favorite food etc. In that setup the tagging of a person to a task and the person's info page is one in the same (2 tables that are linked). I'm wondering what the best way to setup this kind of functionality in org-mode would be?
 TL;DR: Tag or properties for adding people to tasks?
 Thanks in advance!

 Just a little question to see if anyone can help me.
 Imagine I have an item with a classic TODO state
 * TODO Buy the milk
 Now, I have another TODO state called TODAY, and I change the state of this item to
 * TODAY Buy the milk
 How can I do to schedule or reschedule (if there exists already a date) to today's date automatically after changing to the TODAY state?
 Is there a built-in function for that?
 Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use emacs to read a lot of PDFs, using the excellent pdf-tools package.
 But (like emacs users everywhere), I was not happy with a couple aspects of the default behavior.
 In particular, I use pdf-occur a lot, but the default behavior of display-buffer is to split my PDF frame vertically into two windows with the top window showing a too-small-to-read view of the PDF and the bottom window showing the list of occurrences.
 Maybe there is a better way, but this is what I did (which I share in case it helps someone else).
  (add-to-list display-buffer-alist '("^\\*PDF-Occur\\*$" (display-buffer-pop-up-frame) (pop-up-frame-parameters . (auto-hide-function . delete-frame)))) 
 This causes the *PDF-Occur* buffer to be displayed in a newly-created ("pop-up") frame instead of splitting the frame with the PDF document into two windows. (The auto-hide-function causes that frame to be deleted when one "quits" the window in that new frame. That is, when you press q in that buffer, the newly-created frame is deleted.)
 However, there is a secondary problem. When you select the occurence you care about in the *PDF-Occur* buffer and press RETURN, it splits that frame vertically and displays the PDF in the lower-half of that frame (again, in a too-small-to-read format).
 I fixed that by adding a function to the hook for the *PDF-Occur* buffer's mode like this:
 `` (defun my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook () "CauseRETURN' in this buffer to use the window already displaying the PDF and return focus there." (make-local-variable 'display-buffer-alist) (setq display-buffer-alist (cons '(".*\.pdf$" (display-buffer-reuse-window) (reusable-frames . t)) (default-value 'display-buffer-alist))))
 (add-hook 'pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook #'my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook) ```
 Of course, I'm happy to learn if you have critiques of how I did this—or about any of this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I've wanted to play around with emacs 28 without putting my current stable (emacs 27) install in jeopardy. This is possible with chemacs2. 
 I followed the README but I'll add that one should also delete their package-quickstart.el and other similar files that use hard-coded paths, before moving everything around. 
 Once you have your usual emacs in .emacs.default, you can for example create an empty .emacs.future (or any other name), and set it as a profile in .emacs-profiles.el. 
 Next, you can download emacs and build from source with native compilation if you'd like. Do not make install, rather we'll use the path to the newly built executable. 
 Since chemacs2 keeps everything emacs as calls to the default directory, you won't have to change much. 
 What you can do now, is alias to the more recent emacs executable with the future profile. For example, I put the emacs repo in ~/emacs. Meaning that I can do :
 alias ef="/my/home/emacs/src/emacs --with-profile future" 
 To use a different profile with the built from source executable. 
 Thanks to that I have two different versions of emacs with different init files, living together.

 the purpose of this post is two folds: 
  
help others who is learning elisp. It's easy to get started, but confusing at times just b/c there are so many unfamiliar concepts, both from emacs and from lisp. I surely wish someone else had written some deep-dive to help me ramp up faster. Thanks to everyone who helped me during my elisp learning. 
 I am planning to read in depth at least one small and common package per week. If you found this helpful, please recommend me with other small packages (<1000 lines) that's fun to use, fun to read. Thanks!

Now, when I look at libraries providing such functionalities - there are references to cats, monix, zio. Are cats, zio equivalence of each other ? are these required for application development? Or is it for purists only? How should a beginner look expanding understanding of scala ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs offers CUA-mode out of the box to address users expectations for normal C-c (copy), C-v (paste), C-z (undo) commands. Indeed, this is often an issue that comes up when I am teaching newcomers Emacs. So, why don't I hear about this being used more? Why don't I use it? Why was one of my joys in adopting EXWM the ability to use emacs shortcuts INSTEAD of CUA in other progams? Essentially I went the opposite direction.
 Even for those years when I was learning emacs, no part of me ever longed to regain the key bindings that were used everywhere else, and that is strange in retrospect. Was it because learning new keybindings was part of the emacs experience? Or because CUA bindings are already only relevant to Windows users and not Mac keybords? Was it because there is something qualitatively different about killing, yanking, and emacs' undo style than the copy-paste-undo of everything else? I admit, whenever I am forced into non-emacs programs, I do long for the kill ring.
 What do you think? Why is CUA-Mode so rarely brought up as a first step (and therefore rarely brought up at all)?

I just installed geiser, the chicken-repl starts up well in emacs (M-x run-chicken or M-x run-geiser RET chicken) and code entered directly in the repl executes properly, but when I try to execute code in from a buffer, I get this error:
 retort-syntax
 Error: unbound variable: geiser#geiser-eval

 I noticed that the code sent to chicken is this: (geiser#geiser-eval (quote #f) (quote (print "Chicken Test")) which is like a wrapper around my original code and might be what produces the error, but i'm not sure if thats the case or how to fix it.
 ​
 Here is my init.el file, I haven't installed much except MELPA, geiser and a material theme

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to see what solutions are out there but couldn't really find any that I liked. What I want to do is to use the task management part of org mode remote (internet). There are solutions to sync files and then use different re-implementations of org mode on different devices but I want emacs to be the heart of it and not use re-implementations.
 What I'm thinking is something where I can send a command to the server where I have emacs and get a response with a subset of commands like :
  
List tasks (agenda)
 Mark task as done (maybe based on uid)
 Add things to inbox (to be processed when I'm at a computer)
  
I'm considering something like using email (could be similar to how http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/ works) or having an xmpp bot or something similar. Anyone who has done anything similar or seen any projects like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/emacs.
 ​
 I have recently set up a neat feature for Emacs that I wanted to share with you. I am going to give you a short description of what this is supposed to be here, but for more details, and the required code snippets you can check my github repository where I also host my dotfiles.
 ​
 So, if you are tiling window manager user, you have probably heard of scratchpads. If you haven't, they are floating windows with predefined dimensions which are automatically hidden when they lose focus. Why is this useful you may ask? Well, I personally dislike leaving Emacs, especially when I want to write a large piece of text. But there are some things (mostly when I am doing something on the web, such as creating this reddit post) which I can't directly do in Emacs. This project tries to solve this project.
 ​
 I have basically set up my window manager of choice (qtile, but I do plan to try and make this for other window managers such as i3) to create a scratchpad of Emacs which opens in a placeholder file and an emacs command which when ran, copies the whole buffer to the clipboard and then deletes it from the file so it can be used again. This allows me to write everything in Emacs, in a small floating window which is visible whenever I need it and then hides itself when unneeded, using a placeholder file which is always empty and waiting for text to fill it. The setup is honestly very handy and I really like it, as the alternatives are somewhat annoying to use imo. 
 ​
 For more details, check the aforementioned git repo. I hope you will enjoy it. I personally really like the idea and as I couldn't find anyone who has done something similar, I thought I should share this here so you guys can see the idea and adopt it if you like. I will gladly answer any of your questions about this and try to persuade you that its got a reasonable use-case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I'm new to Emacs and I'm a copywriter - I write 3-5k words per day. I'm thinking about quitting libreoffice writer and switching to a keyboard-centric writing experience. I really like Emacs so far!
 The only concern I have is: Can I do these things with Emacs... And how easy is it to do these things:
 -bold a word or a sentence
 -italics
 -align a paragraph to center
 -export to .docx (most of my clients need that format, not a personal preference)
 ​
 Can emacs help me write text and accomplish these 4 things (just as easily or easier than with L.O. Writer)? 
 ​
 I admit, I'm a complete novice when it comes to this. When I tried searching online about these features I found some advanced tutorials on something called latex or pandoc or some other advanced programs. I'm really not a programmer, all I need is these 4 features in order to ditch LibreOffice writer. Can emacs help me with these things?
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 
 I built from source today and installed emacs, I also tried to clean my emacs install and re-install it but it doesn't fix my issue. I didn't have that issue previously when I built from source a month ago. 
 Basically, emacs freezes completely only in some cases. I'd say that most of my usage does not provoke the freeze but for two cases (that I found). 
  
deft, anytime I open it it completely freezes emacs.
 
stan-mode when I try to edit a file. Opening the file works fine but if I try to edit anything, it freezes and I have to kill emacs.
 
 I tried package-reinstall, to no avail. 
 Other modes like org-mode or any other language I'm using or could think of, does work (Racket, Java, Python, Julia, SQL), etc. 
 I can't seem to get an error anywhere and when emacs freezes I have to kill it. If anyone has an idea I'd be grateful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to model software APIs in a best-practice-functional-programming manner. I am wondering how professionals typically go about this problem. What are existing best practices, and so forth.
 More specifically, for my current project, I want to model several geometric primitives (e.g., circle, sphere, triangle) such that I can effectively reason about them and use effective type-checking. I will render them with different backends, and will handle that elsewhere (e.g., JavaScript), but I want to be sure I am effectively modeling the geometric types.
 I'd like to use Haskell.
 The obvious way to go about this would be to begin writing data types in Haskell and potentially use that to generate other code via Template Haskell. Is there a flaw with this approach? I've considered using XML, or using Haskell to generate XML as an intermediate, but I'm not sure if that's necessary or flawed in some way.
 In general, I'd also like to use whatever approach I develop to model systems in the future. I'm not sure what the best way of going about it is. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this, or can point me to some references, so that I don't begin coding something that is doomed to be suboptimal for reasons known to those who know. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. So, I made this thing awhile back originally in the context of developing a programming language which used a lot of Unicode math symbols (basically forcing variable-width fonts) and significant whitespace. Now I use it for all of my personal note files, and it seems like other people might find it useful so I'm releasing it.
 https://github.com/tenbillionwords/spaceship-mode
 ​
 spaceship-mode
 What this basically does is:
  
spaceship-mode makes spaces at the start of a line have their width automatically adjusted to align with previous text as they would in a fixed-width font. Example pictured.
 tabble-mode is an implementation of elastic tabstops.
  
Together these make it possible in principle to do every kind of alignment I have ever seen being useful in an actual programming or plaintext-note-taking situation.
 Using spaceship-mode absolutely requires adhering to the convention of using tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment. Unfortunately, that means these modes work very badly with stock Emacs, yet I am not providing any kind of user-interface features such as commands to help use and maintain the indentation conventions, or any keybindings at all. It wouldn't do to just quickly slap something together, because Emacs' assumption of fixed-width fonts is fairly deeply entrenched in its design, and peeps have very different preferences and methods for dealing with indentation in general. (And I'm not providing my own full setup because...reasons.) So if you want to get this working well, you'll have to do some work to integrate it into your own system. The “Example Setup” in the readme may give some indication of how to start doing this.
 P.S. Thanks to the r/emacs folks who originally helped me figure out how to do this!

 Or in other words can the derived method receive arguments that are not using clauses?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All,
 I'm now using emacs and mu4e for quite few months and I have one remaining concern which is formatting when replying to emails.
 Let's take the following example as my original email:
  
This is the emails chain. This paragraph runs on several lines and is recognized as is on the original email. All of that matches line 1. But when replying to this email, there's now (random?) line breaks inserted here and there. 
 empty line #1 
 The next paragraph starts here.
  
​
 When I reply to this email, the cited text will have (random?) line breaks insertion and all empty lines will be doubled (i.e. one additional empty line will be created for each original empty line). So I end up with something like this:
  
My response to you. 
 Best, 
 RedGuilou 
 --citation follows this line (read-only)-- 
 This is the emails chain. This paragraph runs on several lines and is recognized as is on the original email. All of that matches line 1. But when replying to this email, 
 there's now (random?) line breaks inserted here and there. 
 empty line #1 
 empty line #2 
 The next paragraph starts here.
  
​
 This does not look very professional when replying to my clients and it's boring to correct the formatting on every single email (especially when the emails chain is quite long).
 I'm using org mode to write my emails in case that matters. Any clues on what to investigate to solve this issue would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks !

 Ex:
 * TODO top-level thing [0/1] ** This is a sub-item / requirement for top-level 
 output Ex:
 ...: [time].... TODO top-level thing [0/1] ...: [time] .... TODO This is a sub-item / ... 
 I'm sure there's probably a way to do this sort of thing with org-super-agenda or some fancy org-ql thing but before I run down that trail perhaps someone has a workable partial or full solution?
 Thx!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Haskell newbie. I've tried to get into Haskell development several times, since I love the language, but I've always had issues with tooling.
 My preferred editor is VS Code on Windows, and the Haskell extension seems to provide most features I need.
 Unfortunately, I also have a small hard drive (256 GB) which is mostly occupied. When I used Stack or Haskell Platform in the past, the size of my user directory often reached 20-30 GB due to installed versions of compilers and dependencies, which is too much. I've never had this issue with other languages (rustup or npm only ever take a couple GBs on my PC despite heavy usage).
 Since this is probably unavoidable, I need a way to install GHC, Cabal, Haskell Language Server and all other tools in a completely isolated and portable directory, so that I can just delete or move them away from my PC until needed, while leaving global user directories intact.
 The most obvious solution would probably be Docker, but I'm not sure if it's supported on Windows 10 Home.
 Is there a way to configure both Cabal and Haskell Language Server in a completely portable/non-intrusive manner?
 Thanks!

When asked what's "the most important thing they want students to gain after each class," teachers will always say that they want students to "really understand" the lecture. But as Krathwohl (2002) put it, this is an ambiguous term; they haven't articulated what it means when a student "really understands."
And without a common definition of how well students understand the material, making exams that test understanding would produce large variability.

 I have the following challenge. I would like to open vim from my Scala CLI application... 
 I would like to achieve similar functionality as can be seen when you use git - it opens your editor of choice when committing stuff; allows you to do the editions there and let the user exit vim; then the git picks up and proceeds with its things.
 However, that has proven to be way more tricky than I initially thought. 😅
 How should I approach this; can u please point me in the right direction,... Are there any libs that I could use to handle this; if so which? Can this thing be also "ported" to things like GraalVM if want to package this as native-image at some point?
 A silly example that I've made that uses scala.sys.process; where I thought I should start...
  def editor = sys.env.getOrElse("EDITOR", "vim") def spawnEditor(editor: String) = { val r = Seq(editor, "/tmp/test.md").!! r } 
 Thanks for your help and have a nice day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I need some help.
 I am looking for a better way of working in a node.js / typescript environment. I want to start with creating a dirty repl. This is a huge project and it has a large amount of dependencies, with many many layers.
 One idea I had is to create a REST endpoint within the app on my computer only, that will eval all code sent with the GET request and respond either with {success: result} or {error: message}.
 Now I created a custom keybind, that sends the code that I selected in emacs with a GET request to that endpoint and that works beautifully.
 Here is where I am stuck though, if there was an error (because I am evaluating js code of thisGreatFunction(unsetVariable) {doSomethingWith(usetVarbable)} because unsetVariable and the function doSomethingWith are obviously not defined). This is also where it gets dirty.
 My next thought was to push back on the user in emacs with the error message and let him open a new buffer where he can change the js code sent, ideally also caching the previous responses so he can build a reportoire of code that loads needed sets of dependencies quickly.
 Any ideas on how to make this sort of interactivity happen?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 Is there anyway I can create a generator in Scalacheck that allows me to get not only distinct values but also the list with the exact size I send generate and not less
 Gen.listOfN allows duplicates, and although Gen.containerOfN[Set, String] allows me to get only distinct values, it can then generate less values that the N I pass to the method.
 I writed this method, but it's a little "hack", since it would be great if this worked with returning a Generator and not the List already
 ​
  def createDistinctList[A](i: Int, gen: Gen[A]): List[A] = def createDistinctListAux(i: Int, gen: Gen[A], res: List[A]): List[A] = i match case 0 => res case _ => { val generated = for { value <- gen } yield value val x = generated.sample.get val newI = if x == None || res.contains(x) then i else i - 1 val newRes = if x == None || res.contains(x) then res else res :+ x createDistinctListAux(newI, gen, newRes) } createDistinctListAux(i, gen, Nil) 
 I tried with res.contains(generated) and returning a generator of list, but it didn't work, it only worked this way.
 Any help is appreciated, thank you.
 (Scala 3 btw)

 Does anyone have any recommendations for working with yaml (I wish the answer could be "don't" because I hate it...)?
 Yaml mode is providing some features but it doesn't have the syntax highlighting I'd like, and it doesn't seem to be indentation aware, which makes reformatting files a pain.
 For example, it'd be nice if mark-sexp worked to mark by indentation level.

 Writing to announce a new functional UI programming paradigm and implementation for Haskell. Features a declarative programming model, rendering polymorphism, no FRP constructs, single source of truth, and convenient composition of components via lenses.
 She sure is a Shpadoinkle website (written as statically generated Shpadoinkle)
 Full support for
  
single-page applications (routing with Servant!)
 static site generation
 server-side rendering
 time travel debugging (maturing)
 live reloads with GHCID
 growing widgets library with common types for UI baked in. 
  
Actively maintained by Platonic Systems.
 This work was originally motivated by a desire to capture the lessons I have learned from a decade of working with different UI technologies. As well as a desire to have the benefits of The Elm Architecture without compromising on compositionally, or being forced to use a nerfed language (Elm). Shpadoinkle drops through the abstract floor to uncover the simplicity in the substructure of UI programming. While systems like Reflex offer a recursively Monadic structure, and Elm offers merely Functorial structure, Shpadoinkle is not even a Covariant Functor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a line using diredfl, to give me the permission line visual I wanted. However, I had to go back to my code and re-evaluate the use-package line every session or else I just had font coloring instead. A character inspection revealed that it was indeed applying diredfl faces, but apparently just the default ones, not the ones I was defining. Here was my not-working-until-reeval line:
 Not working invocation (custom)
 (use-package diredfl :demand t :config (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'diredfl-mode) :custom (diredfl-dir-name '((t (:foreground "#3679D8" :box (:line-width 2 :color "grey75" :style released-button))))) (diredfl-dir-priv '((t (:foreground "#3679D8" :underline t)))) (diredfl-exec-priv '((t (:background "#79D836" :foreground "black")))) (diredfl-read-priv '((t (:background "#D8B941" :foreground "black")))) (diredfl-write-priv '((t (:background "#D83441" :foreground "black"))))) 
 Working invocation (custom-face)
 Notice the only difference is that I'm using custom-face, which enables removing the quote from the face definitions. So the question is, why does this fix the problem? What is :custom failing to do (timing wise) that :custom-face is managing?
 (use-package diredfl :demand t :config (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'diredfl-mode) :custom-face (diredfl-dir-name ((t (:foreground "#3679D8" :box (:line-width 2 :color "grey75" :style released-button))))) (diredfl-dir-priv ((t (:foreground "#3679D8" :underline t)))) (diredfl-exec-priv ((t (:background "#79D836" :foreground "black")))) (diredfl-read-priv ((t (:background "#D8B941" :foreground "black")))) (diredfl-write-priv ((t (:background "#D83441" :foreground "black")))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a game development project using literate programming in org-babel. The problem I'm having is the following.
 Say I have a table called "sprites" that defines positional indexes into a sprite sheet:
 #+NAME: sprites | Name | Row | Col | |--------+-----------| | Bob | 2 | 3 | | Joe | 5 | 6 | 
 That gets passed into a block of C++ code as a variable and used for rendering. So far so good. But now I want to use that data to show the sprites in the org document itself. I have a macro that takes an integer index and links to the sprite image (presliced from the sprite sheet for simplicity):
 #+MACRO: sprite [[ ./path/to/sprite-$1.png ]] 
 This gets called like:
 {{{sprite(123)}}} 
 Which works fine. But can I make a macro that takes two arguments and multiplies them (row * width + col) together, like so:
 {{{sprite(2,3)}}} 
 ... and links the sprite for Bob? Or am I limited to simple text replacement? If macros aren't the right tool for this, what is?
 And one step further, can I somehow just do:
 {{{sprite(Bob)}}} 
 ?

 does any of these keybindings conflict with any mode or do they override anything ?I'm worried because I don't know if I should use `C-xyz` for my keybindings...Cause some packages like multiple cursor use `C-'`, does that mean I can't use `C-punctuations` at all?Are we even allowed to use `C-xyz` as our keybindings? or `C-,./()'{};\`? or even `Upper case letters...`?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone.
I began using ZK several months ago and encountered a following conundrum.
I divide notes into two generic classes: core notes and inbox. Inbox consists of notes I might need to work upon in the future.  My inbox keeps growing much faster in volume than my core notes. There're three main sources of its growth.
Firstly, I regularly read professional feeds with a wide range of information that I have no time to integrate right now. Mostly this is a specific momentarily info that might be unavailable in the future (or simply hard to find) so saving it seems pretty important to me.
On the one hand, this inbox propagation seems natural to me - I find that diving into that knowledge dump from time to time turns out pretty useful. And the power of weak connections works with notes as much as with people.
Maybe somebody wants to comment on this? Have you been in a similar situation?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are numerous libs/hacks for showing the Elisp docstring for the symbol at point, but none really worked for me : if you know of one that really does it then please let me know. Anyway, I had to debug something yesterday and so was using my own solution that I knocked up a few weeks ago in order to learn some Elisp. It's a bit "overkill" in that it supports 3 different "display the docstring" front ends, but it defaults to posframe (which works now BTW) and I find it really, really useful. Just enable el-docstring-sap-mode and you're away. I even documented it.... I did one years ago, but this is a refresh. it doesnt do anything clever - the "links" in the pop are non operational...
 ​
 Note: you need to clone it, add it to path etc or just use straight.el. I wont rehash how to do all that, GIYF.

How do you process research that's based on shaky assumptions? By "shaky" I mean that in the middle of reading, you figured that the authors were either assuming that a specific concept is true, or are implying that the specific concept applies to their study's context.
So for example, a lot of other studies are based on Zeigarnik Effect, but other studies on the same concept have failed to replicate the phenomenon. Or implying that the "need for cognitive closure" applies to the "task" context, even when the cited paper refers to closure in the context of beliefs.
Their results would fit nicely into their assumptions and hypotheses, but the assumptions themselves don't hold up based on the other papers.
So if you were in my place, do you think the experiments woul…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a large Hydra for smartparens navigation/actions, and because I want to restrict the height of the Hydra window to preserve space for the main window, the Hydra hints get cut off at the right edge of the screen. So I created a second Hydra and linked Hydra #1 and Hydra #2 together via designated keys (as explained here). 
 The problem is that I’ve memorized many of the bindings associated with both Hydra #1 and Hydra #2, and I want to use all bindings at any time, regardless of whether Hydra #1 or Hydra #2 is showing. This means I have to add every binding relevant to smartparens to BOTH defhydra definitions. This takes up a lot of space in my init.el, and it’s not as simple as copy-pasting because I don’t want hints that show up in Hydra #1 to show up in Hydra #2 (and vice versa), so I have to change the string hints to nil or change nil to string hints as appropriate. 
 I’ve partially solved this last problem by having Hydra #2 inherit the bindings of Hydra #1 with the following:
 (set-keymap-parent hydra-smartparens2/keymap hydra-smartparens1/keymap) 
 However, I can’t simultaneously have Hydra #1 inherit Hydra #2's bindings, as this creates the error cyclic keymap inheritance. Thus, unless I’m missing something (and I hope I am), some copy-pasting from Hydra #2 to Hydra #1 is still necessary.
 It would be great if I could have a single Hydra for smartparens that possessed a height limit and could be scrolled to see the hints that get cut off, like which-key allows. Different displays vary greatly in the horizontal screen real estate they allow. Should I check out hercules.el, or is there an obvious solution I’m missing? 
 P.S. I’m not complaining about Hydra, it is a genius package!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 Long time lurker and first-time (I think?) poster. Anyways, I implemented the Lamport one-time signature scheme a while back in Haskell and wanted to share.
 https://github.com/difelicemichael/lamport-haskell
 It also includes a module solely for the purposes of illustrating the dangers of key-reuse in this signature scheme.
 ​
 As with anything cryptography related, it's always best not to reinvent the wheel, so it goes without saying that the module is not production-ready / suitable. Still though, couldn't resist the urge to share, comments / criticisms are welcome (and encouraged!).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am stumped by some strange behavior in the org mode clock. I use the clock timer (C-x C-i) to time myself when working in different files, and it has always worked a treat. But recently I cleaned up the structure of my org folder, which had lots of subfolders for different clients. I moved all of these folders from /org into a new folder, /org/archive, to give myself a nice clean place to work. Now, however, when I try to start the clock timer, emacs refuses and instead shows me this:
 Use M-x make-directory RET RET to create the directory and its parents [165 times] apply: Setting current directory: No such file or directory, /home/me/org/client-folder/ 
 Where client-folder is the name of a client. I'm guessing that it's trying to check all of my existing files for dangling, unclosed timers, but I don't need it to do that. 
 I tried deleting the org-clock-save.el file in my emacs directory, which the program then recreated, but this is empty. 
 What's telling emacs to look for files in their old directories, and how can I make it stop, or at least redirect it to the new directory path?

 I have been using Emacs for Org Mode on an old mac from some time now. I have bought a Macbook pro and have installed Emacs.
 I have a Dropbox account where I have placed my .emacs.d folder and its contents in, including the init.el and the *.org files I use for the GTD system.
 On the Macbook, I have entered the following code in the init.el file so that my settings and files will be usable on the macbook and the experience will be the same as on my Mac desktop.
 I have setup the following code in the init.el file on my latop
 (setq user-init-file "~/Dropbox/.emacs.d/")
 However when loading emcacs it just loads vanilla emacs.
 Also, when i use Dired to navigate to the dropbox location where i have some .org files located, if I try open a file it fails stating:
 "File exists, but cannot be read"
 ​
 Any guidance appreciated.

I think it could be useful to many people here, especially those who are unsure about what they should include in a Zettel. It helped me get a better idea of how to structure a single note in a way that's useful to me (i.e. for academic research in the humanities and social sciences broadly, and philosophy in particular, with the goal of producing academic papers and other nonfiction writing). But I think it could be useful to anyone reading or writing argumentative non-fiction. At best I think it could help combat a somewhat relativistic tendency I've noticed in online ZK/PKM communities.

 I've found something similar to the IO monad in RxJava, with the Single data type, but once I name RxJava, people assume I'm looking for a streams library and start suggesting stuff I'm not looking for.
 I'm looking for a library that allows me to build effects easily. From futures, completion stages, callbacks, etc. Also I'm looking if it has operators to zip effects in parallel or ideally, a fiber based concurrency model.
 I'm not looking for a streams library, not looking for libraries for distributed computing.

 If I do C-x right or C-x b I can switch the buffer shown in the current window. I have a layout where one frame can have some windows with some buffer. I want to separate all the buffers started in the current frame from other frames so I cant open a buffer from hobby project in a frame I am working on my emacs files. So it should not be possible to switch to a buffer started in another frame.
 Also like *Messages* shouldnt be possible to switch to. Maybe theese should be in a separate frame to separate them from others. Then I could still access them if I wanted to.
 My idea is that I want to have a frame for each project that I am working and it should only be possible to switch to the relevant buffers.
 If anything is unclear, please ask me :)
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like to have imenu-list open while I am programming in Python to have an outline of my file and a list of functions/classes that I can quickly access (side question: are there better packages for this functionality?).
 However, when I open that list then switch the buffer to a different non-python file that I don't need such a list for, I have to manually close that window only to open it back when I switch back to my Python buffer. 
 I am wondering if there's a way to designate a particular window as a "child" of the buffer. So that everytime I switch to that buffer the window is automatically created and then destroyed when I switch away from the "parent" buffer. 
 I could probably code it myself by advising set-buffer, splitting the window if the buffer is a python-buffer and closing it if the old buffer is a python one. But I am wondering if there are better solutions out there.

 I was wondering, what is the consensus for the best version of eMacs on Mac? And is there a port better compatible with M1?
 I saw that mitsuharu Yamamoto’s port was appreciated, but recent posts (1 year ago... there is not a lot of osX users here!) seems to indicate that the NS version was more stable...
 In the past, I used eMacs and org with Ubuntu and WSL, but as I am switching my workflow to Mac, I am tinkering on having a native app installed (rather than using a VM for emacs...). I’ve used my Mac M1 extensively, and faced hundred of bugs and issues with intel based software (from VDI and OBS support to screen through Bluetooth etc)
 Thanks for your feedbacks!

So far it only has recipes for the two versions of ElixirLS that I am using, so I eagerly invite any contributions, questions, or feedback. I started this because I could not find any existing Dockerfiles for language servers, and I hope this can fill that gap for others.

I've been fiddling with writing transcoders for org publish and I'm confused about what is probably a simple data type. I'd google it if I knew what to type.. I'm exporting a table with a caption, so I add the property: #+CAPTION: This is Caption. Ok, so I can pull the :caption property from the table's plist, but the value is wrapped in triple parentheses when I format it to a string: (((This is Caption))) When I try to do things like mapconcat it, the type object is displayed a bit differently: (#("This is Caption" 0 15 (:parent #0))) 
 So now I'm closer, I know this is a list of text properties, right? So I can use car to get the string, but only if I nest it three times over the list: (car (car (car caption))) but there has to be a better way, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am mid/advanced Haskell user, with some experience on the appplication side and I'd be interested to get into library development, but I confess I haven't ventured into Core yet. This is why I'd be curious to know if there are purely language related patterns which, on the current or foreseeable future versions of the GHC, should be avoided if possible for their high burden on performance. 
 In other words, I'd be interested in a list of, say, the top 3-5 patterns which, when frequently used in a program's source code, are the most likely to incur a performance drop that cannot be traced to anything else than their Core implementation. (Thus I am not really interested in performance costs caused by "choosing the wrong data structure".)
 Of course there's the suspicion that these "likely performance-killers when used frequently" will be symptoms of bad design decisions from the application author:
  
evaluating too often (i.e. excessive case pattern matching, incurring unnecessary computations)
 evaluating too rarely (i.e. excessive lazyness, incurring unnecessary garbage collection)
  
I am also interested in real life examples involving these, but perhaps a bit more in patterns that are likely to jam GHC optimization capabilities.

Both are remote-friendly (and the entire team is widely geographically distributed). Due to where Arista has offices, and related paperwork constraints, applicants in US/Canada/Ireland/India are strongly preferred.
 While we initially have a fairly tight notion of what the work we're hiring into is going to be, over time both positions have plenty of room to grow and take on other projects (also in Haskell) throughout our codebase, or even greenfield new stuff. Both also offer the opportunity to work with a really great team of seasoned Haskell devs, as well as nix contributors, etc.

But I have a few questions about the emacs program, mainly about security and privacy.
 Who maintains emacs? Are there regular updates for the program?
 I'm looking for a safe and private place to put all my notes, how do I know emacs is secure and private? What's to stop the program from uploading my notes somewhere? (again, I am not that tech savy so please excuse me)
 Do I need to learn emacs before using orgmode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that I have used backpack in raaz which has internally simplified the package quite a bit. However there are some ergonomic issues in their use at-least in raaz.
  
Firstly, I am not sure why backpack performs the mixing and matching in the .cabal file. I feel it makes the .cabal file rather large and unwieldy. The raaz.cabal is close to 900 lines of code with no real way to split it up. It is probably one of the biggest file in the repository
 
The documentation story is not very nice. Say Module A which depends on Signature Sig in an internal module. Now suppose the top library wants expose a version of A with some module mixed in for Sig, all the documentation of the functions defined are lost. One can solve this as this can be seen here. https://github.com/raaz-crypto/raaz/blob/master/raaz/Raaz/Digest.hs Documenting the functions in the source module (A in this case) is not useful because it is not visible one has to repeat this again in the outside exposed module. Whereas writing the documentation close to the function definition (in module A) make more sense.
 
Mismatch between documentation for hackage vs created by cabal haddock.
 
 I think 2,3 are probably bugs, or there is a way to handle it that I do not know about, but 1 is a design choice. It is curious because ghc supports .bkp files which is not recommended though. Currently .bkp files are only used to include test cases in ghc the compiler or to demonstrate backpack.

 Emacs is a bit more complicated, though; there are a lot more places where I want to select from a list of completions, so packages need to both be good for selecting from lists of symbols as well as lists of files.
 Here's what I've used up to this point:

 ​
 The closest thing to this that I found is putting an "agenda" block in my custom agenda view and using org-agenda-clockreport-mode. The problem with this approach is that there's no way to set the time range of this table the way I want. If I set a different time range in org-agenda-clockreport-parameter-plist, the function that displays this clock table overwrites it internally.
 ​
 It would be best if I could just put a custom clock table to the top of my agenda view by hand somehow. Which hooks or functions am I supposed to use to write custom text in an agenda buffer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Emacs on a Mac and mostly have it open full screen. Sometimes I want to quickly open a new frame that's not full screen (e.g., to put it next to a browser window), while keeping the full screen Emacs window/frame intact.
 To achieve this, I wrote the following function:
 (defun efls/new-frame () "Create a new frame and ensure it's not full screen." (interactive) (make-frame) ;; Return from fullscreen, if fullscreen (when (memq (frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen) '(fullscreen fullboth)) (toggle-frame-fullscreen))) 
 My only problem is that apparently, the toggle-frame-fullscreen also impacts the original full screen Emacs window/frame.
 Does anyone have an idea what causes this? Or any other suggestions to improve this small convenient function?
 EDIT: So apparently toggle-frame-fullscreen can take FRAME as optional parameter. How can I point it to the current frame?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't want to stir up more drama, but the cat's already out the bag. I am a channel operator of #evil-mode@Freenode. There is very little going on in the channel, but it has several very knowledgeable people in it. In the last few days there has been a push for many channels to migrate from Freenode to Libera due to mismanagement. I've set up #evil-mode@Libera to make it easy to find, but have been approached by an #emacs@Libera representative while trying to chanop status for #emacs-circe@Libera (I already have chanop for #emacs-circe@Freenode). That individual suggested me that #evil-mode@Libera might be better named #emacs-evil@Libera to fit into the Emacs namespace and profit from management by several channel operators.
 I find this idea highly intriguing, but don't want to impose the mental burden of people having to migrate from #evil-mode to #emacs-evil, especially for a Libera-only thing (the existing Freenode channel is still there, though slowly thinning out). Therefore the following options are on the table:
 a) Leave things as is, with #evil-mode@Libera following the existing naming
 b) Create #emacs-evil@Libera, set up a redirect from #evil-mode@Libera to #emacs-evil@Libera and adjust documentation accordingly
 c) Other (explain in your comment what other option you see)

 It looks like this (1 big cell and 4 smaller ones):
 ​
  
 big cell 1 small cell 1 
  
 big cell 1 small cell 2 
  small cell 3 small cell 4 
 
 Now I have 2 questions regarding my plan:
 - How do I construct something like that (as far as I know, org-mode does not support such merged tables)?- How do I make it reusable? I mean, there must be a better way than creating a file for each and every day or manually deleting the content of such a table every day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I would like to make a instalation guide to be run with no graphical environment. 
 The idea is to have a guide that the person can read and execute the commands from within emacs, without need to type/copy/paste the commands. When the person executes a code block, a buffer with a term with the command inputted is created.
 * step 1 Explanation bla bla bla #+BEGIN_SRC screen :session my_session command #+END_SRC 
 The example above uses org-mode and ob-screen(org-babel-screen) but I can make it works only with need xterm This way the command is inputted in another desktop window outside emacs running xterm. I guess it also works with others terminal emulators that runs in graphical environments. 
 But as I mentioned I need a solution able to run in tty. Would be possible to use ob-screen with term/vterm inside emacs? Other possible solutions?
 Some extra considerations:
 In some steps the commands are interactives, you need to give some some answers, select stff etc. 
 ob-tmux is a valid alternative to ob-screen but seens to have the same restriction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a series of emacs files that define some of the more elaborate customization areas of my setup, such as orgmode, and gnus. The practice of keeping the setup in separate files is not the question; the advantage it gives for maintaining/tracking setup-specific questions makes it an easy win. However, right now I'm basically doing a load-file from my emacs.el to bring any of them in. My question is, should I instead by making them packages and loading them that way (e.g. finishing my gnus file with provides my/gnus-setup)? Is there a good reason for doing this instead of a floating .el file when it's just me using them? And if so, does anyone have an example of this process, particularly how you load them/add them to your load path?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in a situation where there is a suite of packages that is presently unmaintained by the original author. I have attempted to submit patches back upstream from my fork, however, there has been no response on GitHub, where the repository is currently hosted. I have also separately sent an email to the maintainer address specified in the cabal file and received no response.
 I am generally of the opinion that letting packages fragment due to maintainer absence is a generally bad thing when the ecosystem is small and could otherwise accrete contributions from outsiders. I am now puzzling over how I should proceed. The way I see it my only option left is to republish to hackage under a different name, further exacerbating fragmentation. This also leaves the question of how to name the package, whether naming it as a derivative name is appropriate or whether I should name it something else entirely. Is there any unspoken rules about how package naming should be done in situations like this (or even more generally)?

 I just know that I somehow have to give out a (+1) Whenever it is not Empty and a 0 on the router. My thought process is it gives out (+1) that accumulate on the router that has gives a value of 0 and then all those (+1) act on it. But I am not quite sure.

 (setq w32-pass-lwindow-to-system nil) (setq w32-lwindow-modifier 'super) (w32-register-hot-key [s-]) (global-set-key (kbd "s-s") 'save-buffer) (global-set-key (kbd "s-a") 'mark-whole-buffer) 
 The s-s binding works fine, but the s-a binding does not. Running describe-key s-a reveals that Emacs sees the s-a binding as C-a.
 The same is true when I try to bind s-z, s-x, s-v, s-c (and some, but not all, others).
 I have no idea how to even diagnose this. Any idea what's happening here?

In my case, neither of those, but I do think there is a point in telling about experiences (positive and negative) and here I'll share a bit of mine on a recent conference paper I presented and published. This is not some amazing breakthrough or epiphany; but it is an interesting angle to an existing problem using ideas that were not obvious before working with the Zettelkasten.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to make an extension to the wonderful Deft package that can preview/view files in a side window of the Deft buffer (similar to the functionality of the original Notational Velocity). Deft normally takes a set of text files and for each file, displays a widget in the Deft buffer that, when pressed/clicked, opens the corresponding file. For my extension, I would like the file to be opened in the side window with that window having focus, but with the Deft buffer window still visible. I have had some success getting this to work, but I came across a situation with different behaviors depending whether one "presses" the file widget (by hitting [RET] when the point is on a file widget), or one "clicks" the file widget (by clicking the widget with the mouse):
  
If the file is opened by hitting [RET] (invoking widget-button-press), the file is opened in the side window below and the file’s window now has focus. This is the desired behavior that I want.
 If the file is opened by clicking with the mouse (invoking widget-button-click), the file is opened in the side window below, but the focus remains with the Deft buffer. This is not the desired behavior.
  
To demonstrate this phenomenon, I have made a "minimal" example of it in a package I call "Daft": 
 https://github.com/shankar2k/daft
 How can I make a widget-button-click action that can switch focus to a different window other than the current one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to reduce the clutter in the modeline of org agenda, so I have the following function:
 (defun org-agenda-set-mode-name ()
 "Set the mode name to indicate all the small mode settings."
 (setq mode-name
 `(list ""` 
 (if org-agenda-clockreport-mode
 (if (eq org-agenda-clockreport-mode 'with-filter)
 " Clock{}" " Clock" )
  `"")))` 
 (force-mode-line-update))
 However, when I execute this this function, emacs just exits to the desktop. Is there a way to get more information about this crash?
 Incidentally, something else is wrong in my org setup, because the first time I want to open an org-file, I get
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function org-agenda-set-mode-name)
 org-agenda-set-mode-name()
 run-hooks(change-major-mode-after-body-hook text-mode-hook outline-mode-hook org-mode-hook)
 apply(run-hooks (change-major-mode-after-body-hook text-mode-hook outline-mode-hook org-mode-hook))
 run-mode-hooks(org-mode-hook)
 org-mode()
 I tried updating org-mode to today's version of 20210524, but no avail. I no longer have a custom definition of org-agenda-set-mode-name in my init.el, but still it seems emacs does not want to pick up the default orgmode implementation of that function.
 This is on 27.1, Windows 10.

 data Transaction = Deposit {value :: Float} | Withdrawal {value :: Float} deriving Show 
 When I create a Deposit, I can do print $ value (Deposit 20.5) to print the value. Can I do something like print $ contructorName (Deposit 20.5) and get "Deposit" printed?
 Of course, I can do:
 data Transaction = Deposit {contructorName :: String, value :: Float} | Withdrawal {contructorName :: String, value :: Float} deriving Show 
 but that seems redundant because I have to run Deposit "Deposit" 20.5 to create a deposit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to make Emacs correctly jump into problematic file when I'm running C-x p c make test RET, which runs makefile test target. The problem is, that when error occurs, the error path is correctly detected in *compilation* buffer, but because there are two spaces before the actual path Emacs can't find the file. For example, here's the output:
 stack traceback: [C]: in function 'assert' tests/multivalues-test.fnl:17: in main chunk [C]: in function 'xpcall' /home/andreyorst/.luarocks/bin/fennel:4398: in function ? [C]: in ? make: *** [Makefile:32: test] Error 1 
 Here, when I press RET on the tests/multivalues-test.fnl:17: in main chunk line, Emacs tries to open " tests/multivalues-test.fnl" file (two leading spaces are included as part of the path (reddit strips those even in backticks for some reason)).
 I've tried modifying compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variable by adding there the following regex as per this SO question answer
 (add-to-list 'compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist '(fennel "^.*\\([a-zA-Z/][^\n:]+\\):\\([0-9]+\\):" 1 2)) 
 But no luck, Emacs still tries to open path with leading spaces. Any tips? Thanks.
  
Note, pressing RET on the second error line /home/andreyorst/.luarocks/bin/fennel:4398: in function ? opens correct file. I think because it begins with the / Emacs can find correct path start char.

 ​
 any idea or recommendations or examples how to ship yasnippets with a major mode? 
 ​
 Ideally, users only need to install the package with "M-x package-install" and no more setup, i think i can update the "yas/snippet-dirs" and setup the snippets files correctly, but since this is my first major mode, i'd greatly appreciate if someone can point me to an example or just tell me if there is better way of doing this.

There will be a short span of time (an hour or two) where the website is inaccessible. While https://hackage.haskell.org is inaccessible you won't be able to use it to browse packages and documentation.
 However, cabal-install and stack should continue to work thanks to mirroring, and the process should be automatic.
 If you do need to configure manual mirrors of the package repository, the urls are
 http://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/hackage-mirror/ and http://hackage.fpcomplete.com/
 As usual we will post manual status updates at https://status.haskell.org/
 EDIT: The data transfer is taking longer than we hoped, though all else is going well with the new server. We will hopefully perform the cutover (with attendant downtime) tomorrow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week I hope to get up the nerve to make another video. This time it will be on the script that will 'Track people mentions in archive 202105160502.md`. It is a little more developed. I'll be putting it out in public for your comments and suggestions. This one will not use any Keyboard Maestro Secret Sauce. Strictly a command line tool.
I'll be onboarding Leigh Calvez's The Hidden Lives of Owls - not too much there, I can't recommend this book. To be fair there isn't much known about the live's of owls let alone their hidden lives. I'm not sure what I was expecting when I started this book. It makes me wonder about the next book in the queue The Hummingbirds' Gift: Wonder, Beauty, and Renewal on Wings by Sy Montgomery. Both of these books were recommended by Maria Popova, others that she has recommended have been winners. Overall she is a great reading recommendation filter.
I'm thinking how I use the OMNI BAR.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Initially I only used my ZK for non-tech related things I read.  I then wondered how useful it might be for the wide variety of technical things I read for work and pleasure and whether it might serve a similar purpose to allow for finding new connections between otherwise disparate topics or even items within a topic.  The jury is still out for me.  For example, I recently wrote about 30 Zettels for AWS security related topics.  I allowed my thought process to develop as a function of what I was reading, attempting to ask the same sort of questions I ask for non-tech things.  I don't feel the same sort of power doing it for tech stuff yet.  The weird cross connects don't seem to manifest as much or maybe since it's a new way for me to look at tech it will take some time to get used to it.
I'd be curious to see if any developers, hackers or RE's have used it for tech stuff and how they felt it went.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I may have requested this feature in the past, but I think this shows a better use case.
I'm often using the Omni Bar for searching with terms and Boolean operators for notes that might be relevant to create links. This is how I interact with my archive. For me, full text search rules! Everything else is secondary.
Once I enter a search and move the focus forward to check the returned notes, I can't get back to my search query by hitting the back button. I can go back to prior notes, but it would be beneficial if I'd be able to come across my search query amongst the note history so I could change it without having to remember and retype it two or three times as I refine my query and narrow the focus.
It would be helpful if the omni bar's history included user inputted queries. Its not a full history of the omni bars activity if it doesn't include user inputted searches.
For example, if I query with the omni bar prompts writing and I start looking at the notes returned and decide this is not broad enough of a search. I am tempted to use the "Back" function to try to restore to my prior state. I want to edit the search to prompts AND 'writing OR blogging but it is not there to be edited, so I have to remember what I already searched for and retype it.]]></summary>

 Today I had a look at the VOSK-API and open-source speech to text engine and was pleasantly surprised to find it's quite usable.
 I've put together a small utility for Linux that can be configured to dictate while a key is pressed.
 I'd imagine there is potential for Emacs to take advantage of this kind of functionality too, has anyone currently doing anything with dictation in a Emacs?
 The utility is linked here (although it's not Emacs spesific).

 I'm currently writing a parser for a simple DSL and want to write a test where I load a file from disk, feed it to the parser, and study the output produced by the parser, something like an integration/system test if you want. I'm currently using hspec for unit tests and stack.
 My question is, what would be the best way to achieve this?
 1) is hspec the right tool for this kind of job? 2) how can I get the path of the file to load(assuming its in a know location in the same repo)?
 Thanks a lot and happy haskelling.

 are there any elegant ways of doing this without creating tones of variables ?

 And the yank "0xAB" is invalid, it require type input "16#AB" manually.
 I want to know, is there any shortcut like enter xAB instead enter 16#AB, or o67 instead 8#67, or b10 instead 2#10?

Having treemacs, the last code file i was editing, and a terminal open for a programming classes. Or my notes in an org mode buffer for a gen ed class.

 I have tried ivy view, however the push and pop functionality is not so favorable for my workflow.

 It is hard to debug, because I don't see any errors or warnings. All packages are up to date (and had the same issue since a while).
 I have a REPL driven workflow with elpy, lsp-mode(pyright) and pyvenv.
 The process keeps dying randomly - either after a random command or just on idle. I have to re-activate the env and reload everything and since this can happen even after a few seconds, it is very annoying.
 This repeats many times in a fresh session, but the frequency at some point decreases and I can eventually work for tens of minutes without it dying...
 Did somebody run into a similar issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find Doobie's approach to transaction management very elegant.
 I'm running different operations in a single DB transaction in one of my domain services. For this reason I have a repository, that returns Doobie's ConnectionIOs, which I then "flatmap" to get transactional semantics. I was wondering if you know any good technique(s) to hide this implementation detail, or you just live with it in your project(s).
 Example psuedocode:
 trait UserRepository[F[_]] {
 def insert(user: User): ConnectionIO[Unit]
 }
 ​
 class UserService[F[_]](xa: Transactor[F]) {
 def create(user: User): F[Unit] =
 (for {
 _ <- insert(user)
 _ <- sendEmail(user).to[ConnectionIO] // << can we hide ConnectionIO here? What about transactor?
 } yield ()).transact(xa)
 }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am reading Functional Programming in Scala book, In the chapter 3 & 4 the author has introduced list and optional types for data structure and error handling. What I observed is, the author is creating a data type and data constructs and using Companion object or trait body to declare the functionalities. He is using pattern matching, based on the match respective case function is executed and on top using higher order functions to work with this data types by generalizing the pure functions and passing these pure functions to HOF
 For Example 
 trait List[A]
 case object Nil extends List[Nothing]
 case class Cons[A](head:A,tail:Cons:List[A]) extends List[A]
 In the book, He used a companion object List
 object List {
 // some functions to manipulate the list data type 
 }
 ​
 the pattern is similar for option data type as well but all the functions are implemented in trait body
 My question is what is the need to do things this way ?. May be I am not seeing the big picture and looking from the perspective of creating data types and HOF's to manipulate them. How does this helps composing program.

Update your existing notes, even if they're well-linked to already?
Create a new one and link to the existing?
Create structure note that generalizes both?
Do both #2 and #3?

Calling customize-set-variable on its own or with M-x works, but then I have to select which variable I want to set. What I want to do is call (customize-set-variable 'my-custom-variable) from a hydra option to jump straight to setting the value for that specific variable, but customize-set-variable requires 2 arguments, so that doesn't work. 
 However, I noticed that the embark package does somehow get exactly the behaviour I want, but I'm having trouble understanding how it works so I can replicate it. In embark, customize-set-variable is in embark-variable-map, and selecting that action jumps straight to setting the value for the target variable. I've been reading through the embark source and trying various things and just failing to figure this out. At first it seemed that the variable would need an interactive property, but I couldn't figure out how to even set that, and embark manages without it anyway. I feel like I'm missing some key bit of how this process works that I'd really like to understand. Can anyone point me in the right direction here?

It's an inferior-python-mode buffer, combined with comint-mode. Completion in this buffer stops working if flex style is added to the completion-styles where helm-completion-style is emacs. Alternatively, it works as expected when the styles are either helm or helm-fuzzy. So there's some bad interaction between Helm and flex in this buffer. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow Haskellers,
 I'd like to announce my very first Haskell library, vcs-ignore. Its main purpose is to work with files ignored by supported version control systems (so far only Git implementation is done), like checking if path is ignored, listing ignored paths, etc. It also comes with small executable that can be used standalone as command line utility. It's already on Hackage and should be also on Stackage with next nightly build.
 I originaly wrote because it was needed in my other project head…]]></summary>
