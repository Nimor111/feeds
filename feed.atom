        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In org-agenda, I can hit "z" key to add a note to an item. I need to set (org-log-into-drawer nil) so that the notes are not written to the LOGBOOK. But in that case state changes (TODO => DONE) will be written below LOGBOOK as well.
 Since I only want to add the notes to the section below LOGBOOK, but the state changes into the LOGBOOK drawer, I try to temporarily change the variable org-log-into-drawer to nil before calling org-agenda-add-note and back to t after calling it.
 I can't seem to make this work. The notes are still written to the LOGBOOK drawer. 
 What am I missing?
 Code for temporarily writing notes outside LOGBOOK
 (defun ugt-org-agenda-add-note-below-drawer () "Add note in org-agenda to item, below drawer (usually into drawer)." (interactive) (setq org-log-into-drawer nil) (org-agenda-add-note) (setq org-log-into-drawer t)) ;;;; overwrite "z" key in org-agenda to use my function (add-hook 'org-agenda-mode-hook (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd "z") 'ugt-org-agenda-add-note-below-drawer) ))

 As the documentation of GHCup says:
  
The following commands will download the ghcup binary into ~/.ghcup/bin (or C:\ghcup\bin on windows) and then run it to interactively install the Haskell Toolchain.
  
However, I don't want to install anything to my C drive. It is only used by the system and has very little free space; all my software is installed on drive D.
 Is there a way to install GHCup to a specified location?

 This post ended up being half-announcement and half-story. :p
 I am quite obsessed with key-press efficiency and having as friction-less of a human-computer interface as possible (flow states become magical). 
 This package is aimed at being able to specify arbitrary keymap modes along with arbitrary key sequence setups from scratch as concisely as possible.
 My reasons for a modal, key sequence, oriented bindings DSL: 
  
Reduce wrist and hand strain from the vigorous key-chording I used to do.
 Have major/minor mode specific bindings closer to the home row, for speed and ease.
 Be able to rapidly iterate over my keyboard config to see what feels good.
 Reduce the friction of me trying to specialise the bindings of a new major/mode.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Just took some time to bake a helper command to adjust the laptop's screen brightness, so as that I can easily adjust it in Emacs in a tiling window environment.
 The code is inspired (well, almost copied from) by text-scale-adjust:
 ```elisp (defun w/screen-brightness-adjust (inc) "Adjust the screen brightness by INC*10%.
 INC may be passed as a numeric prefix argument.
 The actual adjustment made depends on the final component of the key-binding used to invoke the command, with all modifiers removed:
 +, = Increase the height of the default face by one step - Decrease the height of the default face by one step
 After adjusting, continue to read input events and further adjust the screen brightness as long as the input event read (with all modifiers removed) is one of the above characters. " (interactive "p") (let ((ev last-command-event) (echo-keystrokes nil)) (let* ((base (event-basic-type ev)) (step (* inc 10)) (cmd (format "brightnessctl set %s%d%%%s" ; +10% or 10%- (if (or (= ?+ base) (= ?= base)) "+" "") step (if (= ?- base) "-" "")))) (shell-command cmd)
  (message "Use +,- for further adjustment by %d%%" step) (set-transient-map (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (dolist (mods '(() (control))) (dolist (key '(?- ?+ ?=)) ;; = is often unshifted +. (define-key map (vector (append mods (list key))) (lambda () (interactive) (w/screen-brightness-adjust (abs inc)))))) map)))))

However, I've decided that org-mode isn't half bad at being a documentation companion, the easy tables are not as featured as I'd like but not half bad at quick register definition tables and such.
 I've been searching Google for the next thing I'd like to do, but haven't struck upon anything that doesn't require a lot of lisp. Surely there's just a Option mode or something for this. Basically I'd like to denote a section of an org document as a code-block for formatting. Just like Markdown and ``` or Reddit with four spaces on the side.
 Is there anyway to mark a section that should be rendered as a fixed-width font when exporting? I don't need to execute code or anything like that. I'd just like Markdown's "fixed-on" and "fixed-off" method.
 Any way to do that?

 I am trying to get to grips with using Org and Babel to run my life (potentially) out of one file.
 Right now I am simply trying to have my Emacs config as one heading of a file - other headings will be used for different projects I'm working on etc. 
 I've provided the complete file I have written right now, which currently fails to tangle anything at all with "Tangled 0 code blocks". 
 Earlier on today this would tangle everything, including the contents of '* To-Do List' out to my init.el, but I've been playing around with the :Properties: of each heading and seem to have broken it altogether.
 Is there something really obvious I'm missing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm rather new to Emacs, but I've found it and especially org-capture very useful. I know how to make an elisp macro to find a specific file or to find one from a variable, but I was wondering if there's a way to incorporate patterns and interactive prompts like %^{PROMPT} into find-file.
 For my work I have to look at a variety of a given documents in multiple languages/editions, which are broken down into sub-books and chapters. For example, reading the Iliad in both Greek and English. However, this results in directories with hundreds of files each, sometimes more, and trying to find the same chapter in a different edition is a pain. For sake of example, let's use the Bible.
 All files have been systematically assigned a file name that follows the same exact pattern. Note: Edition is used as both the subdirectory and the first part of the filename.
 ./(Edition)/(Edition)_(Book_ID)_(Chapter)_read.txt 
 Let's say I'm reading Genesis Chapter 1 in Greek. It's broken down by chapter at the following directory:
 ./grcbrent/grcbrent_002_GEN_01_read.txt ./grcbrent/grcbrent_002_GEN_02_read.txt ./grcbrent/grcbrent_003_EXO_01_read.txt 
 But, now I want to compare it with Genesis Chapter 1 in Latin:
 ./latVUC/latVUC_002_GEN_01_read.txt 
 So, is there an easy way to program a function that, while viewing ./grcbrent/grcbrent_002_GEN_01_read.txt, I don't know, reads buffer-file-name, replaces both the directory name and the first part of the filename until the first underscore with "%^{Edition}"("./%^{Edition}/%^{Edition}_002_GEN_01_read.txt") to produce a minibuffer like the following:
 Edition: 
 and after typing latVUC [RET] does (find-file "./latVUC/latVUC_002_GEN_01_read.txt") ?
 TLDR
 I want to be able to jump from version a of a file to version b, i.e. (./a/a_x_y.txt to ./b/b_x_y.txt) where b is typed in the minibuffer.
 I appreciate any help in figuring this out. Thanks!

 Using Doom Emacs, I installed ghub and forge and wrote in my config file:
  (setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg")) 
 I created a GitHub token, pasted it in the required format in authinfo.gpg : 
 machine api.github.com login my_user^forge password TOKEN 
 But still each time I try any git interaction using Magit it asks me for username and password. I wouldn't complain usually, but now if you want to go through it you'll have to type the token instead of your password, which is not really practical.
 I try to fix this problem for some time using the ghub docs and other, with no success.
 Did it happen to anyone?

 I have been looking into jwiegley’s async, and see that you can create futures that allow emacs to be blocked until its child process exits.
 Is there a way for Emacs to be instead interrupted when child process exits? Then Emacs doesn’t need to be blocked until the child process exits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I post this here in case I am doing something silly. My org experience has gone haywire - for instance I cannot display the agenda.
 I will describe two symptoms: In one of the files, there is a null byte (00) between each character. Here is a hexl view of a PROPERTIES block of one file.
 00000220: 0020 0020 0020 003a 0050 0052 004f 0050 . . . .:.P.R.O.P 00000230: 0045 0052 0054 0049 0045 0053 003a 000d .E.R.T.I.E.S.:.. 00000240: 000a 0020 0020 0020 003a 0049 0044 003a ... . . .:.I.D.: 00000250: 0020 0020 0020 0020 0020 0020 0020 0061 . . . . . . . .a 00000260: 0036 0061 0032 0072 0037 0071 0030 0079 .6.a.2.r.7.q.0.y 00000270: 0064 006a 0030 000d 000a 0020 0020 0020 .d.j.0..... . . 00000280: 003a 0045 004e 0044 003a 000d 000a 000d .:.E.N.D.:...... 
 Back to the agenda. Below is the traceback with the error. The looking-at(nil)makes me think it is the same issue.
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil) looking-at(nil) org-heading-components() org-in-commented-heading-p(t) org-agenda-prepare-buffers((list of files)) org-agenda-prepare("TAGS ") 
 Possibly related, althought I don't see how, is the question I posed a few hours ago, on how to escape the underscore character, where one of the answers (see here) suggests a zero width character - which I did try in an unrelated buffer.
 So, am I imagining a problem that is not here, or those null bytes really should not be there, and in that case, how did they get into my buffers?
 Thanks,
 Mirko

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal
 I have two collections of Org files: ~/Documents/life for my Org agenda files, and ~/Documents/org-roam for org-roam files.
 I would like to export all org-roam files to HTML in ~/public_html.
 What I've done so far
 I set up export like this:
  (setq org-publish-project-alist '(("org-roam" :base-directory "~/Documents/org-roam/" :base-extension "org" :publishing-directory "~/public_html/" :recursive t :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html))) 
 However, when I run org-publish and select the org-roam project, I get the following error in *Messages*:
 org-id-find: not a regular file: ~/Documents/life/data 
 Does anyone have an idea of how I could fix this? ~/Documents/life/data is the org-attach directory for my agenda files, but I don't want to publish this so I have no idea why it's being processed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm learning Scala through a little data project, which is basically requesting many pages to extract the data and save it somewhere after doing some stats using Spark. 
 I did the part where I can extract the data, but the Job that does the batch requests is not working due to the mass 429 error I get. 
 I know that using "thread.sleep" is not good practice, but I don't know how to solve the issue while staying on something not big scale. 
 ​
 Here's what I'm roughly doing:
 This is a basic Class (DataGet - stupid name for now) 
  private val backend = HttpURLConnectionBackend() def getOnMasterNode(url: String): Either[String, String] = { val request = basicRequest.get(uri"$url") val response = request.send(backend) response.body } 
 And this is where I do the batch requests (urls is just an array of String):
  urls.foreach(item => DataGet.getOnMasterNode(BASEURL + item) match { case Left(body) => DataGet.writeDataToFile(body, BASEPATH_MN + "-" + item.split("/").toList.last + day + ".html" ) case Right(_) => LOGGER.error("Error while fetching the data page") }) 
 If someone can oriente me toward some kind of solution that would be helpful.

 I am writing a type checker in Haskell, and I am frequently annoyed by the fact that I can't name a variable as type.
 In Rust, you can append the prefix r# to an identifier (like r#type), but it feels so noisy. Glad I never had to use it in practice.
 That made me curious: how do you guys work around this kind of problem in Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I've been looking for a way to use org-gcal with multiple files. So org-gcal takes org-mode files and syncs scheduled items with your google calendar. But the problems is that it syncs only between 1 file and 1 google account. I have one google account but I scatter my todos inside different files for different projects. What do you think would work the best?
 My current thought is I should create a single file that maybe gets updated every time I update a scheduled item, and sync that single file with my calendar.
 One crux of this solution might be how to copy the todo items and connect back to its source. I’m using org-roam so theoretically I can make store an id to point to the original item without much overhead? 
 Do you see any problems with this approach? Have you done something similar? How would you do something like this? Many thanks.

 Edit
 Strange, I can paste capital umlauts like "Ü", but not "ü".
 What is even more strange: I can copy the text from the Emacs buffer back into another editor, and the umlauts are shown correctly. So it's just a problem showing the characters correctly in the Emacs buffer. The text info is preserved though.

 Where I’m lost though is three major ways. 
 How do I organize the data in terms of structure? Not like from a technical perspective but from an organizational one? I know different people will have different systems, but this is a little too much rope. Can anyone suggest a tutorial that broadly goes over how they structure their “life” (multiple types of todos. Calendar, goals, etc…) in org mode files?
 I’m also a little unclear and how to do something distributed without org mode. Do I manually have to sync files over GitHub? Can I edit my todos on my phone?
 The last major piece is integration with other apps. Can I integrate it tightly with iOS (get Siri to add something to my todo list) or get my stuff to sync with my work place google calendar?
 Thanks!

 Hello! I want use yamllint to see any errors in YAML files. When I install it and edit ~/.emacs as follows:
 ``` (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
 (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook 'flymake-yamllint-setup) (flymake-mode)
 (package-initialize)
 (when (version<= "26.0.50" emacs-version) (global-display-line-numbers-mode))
 (setq completion-styles '(basic partial-completion emacs22 substring))
 ;; Interface customization (set-face-foreground 'default "#660066") ```
 and open my test .yml file I obtain nothing except this error:
  Warning (flymake): Disabling backend flymake-proc-legacy-flymake because (error Can’t find a suitable init function) 
 How to fix it? I don't understand why it happens. Also when I tried to setup keybindings for switching between several errors:
  (define-key flymake-mode-map (kbd "M-n") 'flymake-goto-next-error) (define-key flymake-mode-map (kbd "M-p") 'flymake-goto-prev-error) 
 I obtained another error:
 ``` Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/emilyseville7cfg/.emacs’:
 Symbol's value as variable is void: flymake-mode-map
 To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace. ```
 It's strange because documentation provides exactly these Lisp expressions. What am I missing?
 See my issue for more details on GitHub

Now for my question, I am a data engineer and have been to a couple of jobs where scala developers show this attitude about python as it is some sort of easy shallow langage. I just wanted to understand if this is a general trend in the industry that I must get used to. I get how scala can be smarter and more mathy etc. which is cool but what's with attitude ? Now with python becoming more and more popular, I have a hard time understanding where these people are‍ coming from... just a thought nothing personal

 myList :: Map MyType String
 myList = fromList [
 (MyTypeItem1, "myString1"),

 ​
 I resorted to making a backwards list in order to get a key from myList given a value:
 myBkList :: Map String MyType
 myBkList = fromList [
 ("myString1",MyTypeItem1),
 ("myString2",MyTypeItem2)]
 ​
 I have the following function that, given a [String] will return the [MyType]
 funcStrMT :: [String] -> [MyType]
 funcStrMT = mapMaybe (flip Data.Map.lookup myBkList)
 ​
 How can I rewrite funcStrMT so that I do not need myBkList? I want to lookup the original myList to find [keys] for [values]. The list will not have duplicate values or duplicate keys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y'all! My team at Mercury is hiring a GHC engineer. Our engineering team has around 90 people right now, so we'd increasingly benefit from work on GHC, primarily on compilation performance and IDE support. We already contract out some of this work (big thanks to FPComplete, Well Typed, and Tweag!), and we're interested in developing some in-house talent as well.
 This role would be with our developer user experience team, and would report to me (Matt Parsons).
 These are the criteria we're looking for from applicants:
  
Have experience contributing to GHC (this is a hard requirement)
 Have 3+ years engineering experience
 Be comfortable working independently
 Still care about Mercury as a product
  
Most of our team is remote and working in the US and Canada. We can accomodate other countries if there's some time zone overlap (eg the UK)
 Here's the full job post if you want to take a look: https://mercury.com/jobs/ghc-compiler-engineer
 If you're interested, you can apply at https://boards.greenhouse.io/mercury/jobs/4330398004#app

 I want to declare an abstract base class that requires its descendent classes to implement methods that return their own types.

 case class Child() extends Parent { def +(that: Child): Child = ??? } ```
 Any suggestions?

I am reading through Bernt Hansen's "Organize Your Life in Plain Text!" document which has been extremely helpful. However it appears the document is somewhat outdated
 I'm pretty sure it hasn't been updated since 2015 (judging by the version). The screenshots are outdated. When I add the Lisp code under section 9.1 "Clock setup", then I go to clock in a task with "C-c C-x C-i", I receive the following message in the echo area:
 Symbol’s function definition is void: bh/is-task-p
 Anyways, I am just curious: does anybody know of any documents similar to this one that are more up to date? I am very grateful to Bernt Hansen for creating this document, as it's been an enormous help to me thus far. But I would just like to see if there's any other similar documents that are up to date.

Where do I find bigO notations for apis like 'Sliding' and others?

 getData dd = dog <- getgetDetails (getName dd) In $ delete (var dd) $ concatMap...
 and a Dictionary:
 myList :: Map String NewType
 myList = fromList [("String1", StringNT1),("String2", StringNT2)]
 The current getDetails function has a String as the first argument (from getName dd). Essentially getName dd creates a String and passes it as the first argument to getDetails.
 What I want to do is check if getName dd is in myList. If it is in my list, then I want the code to execute as it is, but if it is not in myList, I want getData to instead send pass arguments to getDetails2, which will be the same as getDetails but will have NewType as the first argument:
 getDetails2 (getName dd) In $ delete (var dd) $ concatMap..
 What I am looking for is something like this (in partial peudocode):
 ​
 getData :: DataDef -> TheState [Vars]
 getData dd = do
 g <- get
 let ToBeTested = getName dd
 if (myList ! ToBeTested) 
 {
 getDetails2 (myList ! ToBeTested) In $ delete (var dd) $ concatMap...
 } else {
 getDetails (getName dd) In $ delete (var dd) $ concatMap...
 }
 If getName dd is in the list then execute getDetails2 with the NewType value from the key, otherwise execute the original getDetails.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bit of code that generates random valid (they may not make any sense of course but they should compile) C programs. Unfortunately I have cases where certain expression generation or statement generation rules may fail. I don't really have an elegant way to recover from these failures. I was wondering if anyone would be able to maybe give me some suggestions regarding as to how.
 Here is the start of the module:
 https://pastebin.com/MCqJ4szQ
 Here is a snippet of my code so you may understand what I am talking about:
 https://pastebin.com/iL6VQZDz 
 I would prefer a better solution than to retry on failure (see line 6 of the snippet) . I would also like to generate variables when there are no valid types in the available variables, I know I could use catchError but I do think that is not as elegant as I would like.
 In addition, I do not like how I generate random integers to choose the execution path because then I need to program for the case where the generated integer goes out of bounds (even though it is hard coded to not do this). If you have better solutions, I would really appreciate hearing them.
 Thank you very much!
 Update: I will add more code as soon as I get back to my laptop, I thought the context might have been enough but I was wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm starting to really use emacs for some tasks (org-mode mostly), but one thing confusing me is how eager emacs jumps/kills over words. Say, I have a few lines of code:
  (goto-char beg-line-point) (backward-kill-word 1)) 
 If my cursor is at the beginning of backward-... and I start jumping or killing words backward, what I expect (and have in, say, my VSCode editor) is first jump to beginning of text ((), then to the beginning of line, then to the closing parenthesis on the previous line, then to the end of ...-point (after t) - and only then to before p. But what I get in emacs is it jumps to before p in ...-point immediately on first press.
 Can I somehow reconfigure emacs' word recognition for it to jump words more accurately? Maybe configure word beginning/ending regexp to add symbols/newline to them?

 I am new to emacs.
 I have a simple need in mind and would like to ask if there exists a mode for my requirements.
 ​
 I have a large library of txt files in the range of 1-2 millions (archival stuff).
 What I basically look for is some mode that can do something along the lines of:
 - Internal links that can reference particular paragraphs in other files (in Obsidian called 'link to blocks')
 - Transclusion
 ... and do so with the large number of files; that is to say, not a personal knowledge base, but a solid archival library.
 I have in mind pretty much what Obsidian internal links can do.
 I know there is howm, freex, and org-roam (though I've heard the latter can only handle well personal knowledge base, not a larger archive library).

 Apparently the theme comes with lots of customization options, see here: https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/modus-themes.html
 So M-x customize-variable RET modus-themes-org-blocks RET give me the option to change the background of org-blocks.

In the following video I show how to create a project, how to call the GitHub API, parse JSON, and create a binary to use our app from the terminal. I do this from Emacs and SLIME, the IDE for CL. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAtwcBh1QLg 
 If you wrote some Elisp, you will notice differences. For example, the REPL is different, more featureful than IELM, that I don't use that much for Elisp. We have an interactive debugger with restarts (actions we can choose, in the video I go to the source file, I re-compile the function, I come back to the debugger and I choose "retry", and the call passes). As a developer we can set our own restarts, of course.
 Some other things I do are: co…]]></summary>

 Does anyone write handwritten notes on a tablet and then convert those to org files? How labor intensive is it? What applications are involved?

 I know there are a lot of options for text expansion, and they each seem to have slightly different preconcepts, encouraging slightly different use.
 Emacs' built in 'skeleton' system has its own 'microsyntax'(?) and is clearly geared to popping in medium- or large-sized structures defined ahead of time, usually where certain fields have to be filled. (I also recall bemoaning how poorly-documented skeletons were, especially online...)
 I know 'yasnippet' is based on the way TextMate did it. I didn't use TextMate, so I'm not sure…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-17T23:01:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a way of viewing Monoid as a one-object Category. I want a Haskell-like name for this Category.
 -- >> Ok "hi" . Ok "!" . Ok "!" -- Ok "hi!!" type Ok :: Type -> Cat () newtype Ok m a b = Ok m 
 A Category of a single object Cat () adds trivial typing to a Monoid, the values are arrows from '() to '(). It is effectively untyped as any two arrows can be composed. 
 instance Monoid m => Category (Ok m) where id :: Ok m a a id = Ok mempty (.) :: Ok m b c -> Ok m a b -> Ok m a c Ok m1 . Ok m2 = Ok (m1 <> m2) -- >> Distance 10 . Distance 20 . id -- Distance 30 type Distance :: Cat () newtype Distance a b = Distance Int deriving Category via Ok (Sum Int) 
 Questions:
  
What would you call the Ok type?
  
I like a variation of Typed to highlight that it takes an untyped Monoid and adjoins dummy types to it.
 Names like AsCategory and MonoidCat presume that it is exclusive to making Monoid a Category. It also lifts Group to Groupoid.
 
Names like OneObject are not very descriptive. And actually nothing prevents Ok from being polymorpic in the object kind
 Ok :: Type -> Cat ob 
 
 
Would you define (>>>) = (<>) or (<<<) = (<>)?
  
The regular composition operator is right-to-left, so choosing (.) = (<>) seems to flip the order.
 
I did a poll with the results
  
14.9% — (>>>) = (<>) 
 12.8% — (<<<) = (<>)
 31.9% — No right answer
 40.4% — Doesn't matter
  
It is easy enough to use Ok (Dual m) or Op (Ok m) to reverse the order but I would like justification of one choice over the other.

I suspect this is either due to undo-tree or flyspell in conjunction with GC set to collect at 1gb, profiler gives me some information but the issue is very hard to reproduce. 
 Is there any way for me to 'save state' such that I can easily reload the same memory, so that I can better hunt down this issue?
 Failing that my current plan is to cut chunks out of my emacs conf, and use xdotool to type junk data in buffers until I can reliably reproduce.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm aware of Emacs rectangle commands. Unfortunately, they all work on a rectangle in bulk. I'm wondering if there are commands - built-in or from an external package - that would allow me to narrow the buffer to a rectangle, or otherwise edit text within the rectangle?
 My immediate use case is text that's effectively a table, like Hydra's "awesome docstring". Taking the first example from the repo README:
 " ^Mark^ ^Unmark^ ^Actions^ ^Search ^^^^^^^^----------------------------------------------------------------- _m_: mark _u_: unmark _x_: execute _R_: re-isearch _s_: save _U_: unmark up _b_: bury _I_: isearch _d_: delete ^ ^ _g_: refresh _O_: multi-occur _D_: delete up ^ ^ _T_: files only: % -28`Buffer-menu-files-only _~_: modified " 
 Say I want to move the save command to be before delete, and I also want to remove mark command. Currently, I have to deal with manually un-reordering and realigning all the other entries to the right of the text I want to manipulate. A better workflow I imagine would be to narrow editing to a rectangle covering the first column of the Hydra docstring, and do my manipulation in that scope, without worrying about text around it. Is there anything available that would support such workflow? Or, what are the recommended alternatives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The commit make timer_check even more resilient triggers some problem in WSL that results in high CPU usage.
 But it's clearly a problem on the WSL side of things. The behavior vanishes after converting the WSL distribution instance to WSL2.
 The output from profiler-report:
  Samples % Function 4003 69% - command-execute 4003 69% - call-interactively 3996 69% - byte-code 3996 69% - read-extended-command 3996 69% - completing-read 3996 69% - completing-read-default 7 0% - read-from-minibuffer 2 0% - command-execute 1 0% - call-interactively 1 0% funcall-interactively 7 0% + funcall-interactively 1572 27% - timer-event-handler 1572 27% - apply 1572 27% + #<compiled 0x1f688e8844f794b6> 210 3% - ... 206 3% Automatic GC 4 0% + minibuffer-complete 
 I don't need a solution for this, but I've seen a few posts in this subreddit about Emacs in WSL, so perhaps I can save somebody some time chasing this problem.

 I have a question, may be this is very basic for most of you but I have no experience with this so please bear with me. 
 I want to fetch data from .csv and get output that will count the data and group by the count, for example if there are two columns client and job,
 I want an output that will show jobs that are <50, between 50-150 and >50, the csv file does not have column headers just the data, I've done something like this, 
 My csv dataset,
 ​
  
 c1 20 
  
 c2 102 
  c3 50 
  c4 80 
  c5 140 
  c6 2036 
  c7 568 
 
 ​
 I've done something like this,
 import org.apache.spark.sql._ import org.apache.spark.sql.types._ import org.apache.spark.SparkContext object Main { def solution(sc: SparkContext) { val dataLines = sc.textFile("Data/client_jobs.csv") val data = dataLines.map(_.split(";")) case class data(client: STRING, job: INT) } 
 I assumed I have to make a class like this to give columns their names, I don't know of this is correct or not. Thanks in advanced

They are intended for the diary and the calendar, though you can make them show up on the org-mode agenda. I did a quick write up here for anyone interested:
 https://mrincon.net/posts/org-calendar/
 The package is here:
 https://github.com/foxfriday/date-functions
 The package is not refined, and I suspect the uses are pretty limited, but perhaps someone other than me will find it useful. If so I'll try to add more documentation and non U.S. holidays. I was encouraged by the surprising discovery that a few people found the ink.el package useful (thanks).

 I was wondering if someone could help find a fast workflow for org-capture (specifically for save screenshots and text drafts that appear in my head) , I still saving things like images and notes in my telegram, but it really sucks sometimes because I don't want to be dependent on the telegram cloud, so I was wondering about set some keybind in my WM (I use dwm) to capture things.
 Example: I use an app that runs on background and everytime my screenshot folder is updated, it reads and send me a result (it's actually that: https://github.com/kha-white/manga-or)
 Can I do something like that for org capture or in Emacs? For text notes I may set another keybind that opens a template in org-capture and just save the draft)

The difficulty with designing and implementing PyTorch models is with the dimension mismatch errors e.g. multiplying two matrices AB however the number of columns in A does not match the number of columns in B. The idea is that a developer can write about a dozen lines of code and catch all their mismatch errors.
 I'm posting it here because maybe some of you have an interest in deep learning and Haskell and also because I would like some feedback. I'm relatively inexperienced as a Haskell programmer. Should I make this a cabal package? Any tips for making a cabal package? What kind of documentation would be helpful? Any suggestions on how to make a code generator? What you do you think of the code quality?

There have been many attempts to gather them, https://haskell.org/documentation being the most obvious, but none of them have fully succeeded. We could really do with some more systematic, scalable (crowd-sourced, lightweight) approach.
  
Then I experimented and set up https://haskell-links.org . This is version 1, providing:
  
A searchable read-only view of the Haskell links collected with lambdabot, the popular #haskell IRC bot.
 
A redirector/link shortener/memory aid, for jumping to any of these links via their short ID. Eg: 
 https://haskell-links.org/doc https://haskell-links.org/books https://haskell-links.org/ghc-guide
 
Collected links to other Haskell search tools, making this a fast way to get to anywhere in Haskelldom.
 
 After contemplation and discussion on #haskell, I believe version 2 should allow web editing and use its own database. But I wanted to share this one as it's a nice simple setup. I hope you might find useful ! Help is welcome, see README.
 Best, -Simon

Basically, I want it to behave like the %^{PROMPT| DEFAULT| OPTION1| OPTION2| OPTION3} expander, but where instead of being hard-coded into the capture template, the options are provided by an elisp function that runs when the capture action occurs. I'm aware of ido-completing-read, but I prefer the way the menu of options are presented in the normal org capture process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Holy cow, I am using orgmode since 2012ish, and just started learning about all the goodies recently. For instance how to quickly filter org-agenda items, for example (in org-agenda view) 
  
hit the key ^ (caret). This'll filter all tasks that belong to the same outline parent item.
 or hit the key \ (backslash) to filter by tag
 and hit | (pipe) to clear the filter
  
There's lots more, see: Filtering/limiting agenda items in https://orgmode.org/manual/Filtering_002flimiting-agenda-items.html
 I f*ing love this tool! Literally makes me enjoy working on my projects!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does org-mode (and/or org-agenda) offer a date attribute which represents not "you will start the work now" (which is my understanding of SCHEDULED) but instead "you can start the work now" (what I would call DEFERRED)?
 Or can I configure SCHEDULED to behave with "deferred semantics" by customizing a few variables?
 What I mean by "deferred semantics" is mainly a couple things:
 - if I have not yet reached the deferred date, then the task is not yet available to be completed, so I don't want the TODO keyword to show up as an angry alarming bright red, but in a more muted color.
 - I'd like a view that shows only TODO items that are available -- that is, items which are past their deferred date and in a TODO or DOING state -- hiding entirely those items that are completed or deferred for the future.
 In general, with SCHEDULED's current semantics, I feel like it is designed only for an item with a fixed time, like a meeting. But I almost never want to assign a fixed time to a task, since at any point in time I prefer to choose which task to work in the moment, based on a view of the set of possible tasks that are available. 
 For what it's worth, my thinking on this is influenced by the GTD productivity system, which has influenced similar visibility functionality in the OmniFocus app on Apple's platforms.

 All of the functionality seems to be there -- I'm able to produce output, etc. --- but it refuses to fontify.
 When I type "+#begin_src lilypon" everything looks pretty until I put the final "d" in "lilypond", at which point all the styling evaporates, and I get "Org mode fontification error in #<buffer"
 Any other language I've tested (python, ruby, elisp, R) works just fine. The problem seems limited to lilypond.
 The problem disappears when I turn off native fontification, but I kind of like having the fontification.
 Is there any hope for me?

Search Before You Ask
Sometimes, a post will ask one or multiple questions that have been asked here or elsewhere.
It doesn't hurt to do a little search before asking. It saves other people's time from providing answers that have already been given. It also trains your research skill. In addition, it allows you to make more educated questions. Besides, you can't always rely on others to do all your thinking. You'll have to get your hands dirty one day, little star.

 Below is my attempt so far. As dabbrev-expand (M-/) works to expand variables and keywords at point in the Python shell, I would expect company-mode to be able to complete with company-dabbrev as a backend but it doesn't work.
 My company-mode config (using use-package):
 (use-package company :ensure t :bind (:map company-active-map ("C-n" . company-select-next) ("C-p" . company-select-previous)) :config (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 3) (setq company-idle-delay 0.0) (setq company-quickhelp-delay 0.0) ;; set default `company-backends' (setq company-backends '((company-files ; files & directory company-keywords ; keywords company-capf) ; completion-at-point-functions (company-abbrev company-dabbrev) )) (global-company-mode t)) 
 EDIT: Got it working with these backends (found in this post, so thanks u/UpInHarms/):

 I've recorded a simple macro and I don't want to use it as a named macro. I prefer to use it as a function.
 Is there a way to use the output of last-kbd-macro and create a function I can call interactively?
 I was looking for this on the web and trying to find eval macro functions in Emacs but so far, I wasn't lucky. Maybe there is no possibility and everybody is preferring named macros?

 Over the past few years I've written several low-level bindings: freetype2 (actually on Hackage), libvorbis (still waiting for a review on that one) and libpng (package name for that is free, I've just never submitted anything to Hackage myself).
 There is one massive problem with all of these bindings, expressed as following:
  
Take a look at freetype2-0.2.0#FT_FaceRec. As Storable covers the entire datatype, peek retrieves all of the fields regardless of whether you only use one; poke writes down all the fields, making partial writes impossible.
 Take a look at freetype-0.1.2#FT_FaceRec_. FT_FaceRec_ is an opaque datatype there, with fields expressed as …]]></summary>

My name is Erich. I found this forum about a year ago when I came across the concept of Zettelkasten in a YouTube video. I have learned much from entries in this forum, other online sites, and the book entitled, How to Take Smart Notes.
I am not sure why I am so drawn to the Zettelkasten method other than to help me retain and build upon my thinking. I am a Program and Management Analyst within my organization and feel I can also use this capability in research and writing efforts.
I currently use my iPad Pro with iA Writer for my Zettelkasten. So far, I have about 10 notes and my goal is to add a few each week.
My current structure for Permanent notes is:
YYYYMMDDHHMM [UID]
Note Title -
Note body text
Tags: #Name of tag
Links: YYYYMMDDHHMM - Title of note [I hand type the link but do not use the Markdown hyperlink capability. I visit the link by copying and pasting it into the find text feature.]
References: YYYYMMDDHHMMR - Last name
My current structure for Reference notes is:
YYYYMMDDHHMMR [UID - R is added to the end to denote reference]
APA cited reference
Optional high-level notes about the reference text.
I have a Zk_Vault directory with 3 sub-folders including:
Zk_Fleeting - [I use a similar UID naming structure like other notes but add an F to the end of the date-time stamp]
Zk_Permanent
Zk_Reference
Look forward to learning from the group.]]></summary>

 emacs-groundup
 Hi!
 I wanted to introduce emacs-groundup - a config for elisp novices. Here are some of the main highlights:
  
For users looking to 'try emacs', it can be used as-is by setting only a handful of (including zero) parameters.
 For users looking for a task-management workflow, emacs-groundup provides a solid foundation and lots of out-of-the-box functionality.
 The intended user-base is elisp novices 'looking to get serious'. The code is amply commented, and package configurations are as decoupled as possile. Perfect to learn how to write elisp and how to configure some of the more commonly-used packages.
 The system is pre-configured for python and Julia programming only.
 The config uses a customised leuven theme and embraces a colourful aesthetic.
  
Give it a go! All user feedback and contributions are welcome.

I’ve been happy with this setup since version 18 days, with only minor subsequent tweaks. And again, I’m in it more days a week than not.

 After get in touch with FP for few years and learning scala in most recent months, I'd prefer to work with Scala with type classes, implicits, type system and powerful compiler, not first class function languages like js.
 Want to hear advice on how to make this happen. I'm also thinking maybe learn rust and get into backend first and find scala projects later on. I'm planning to make the switch in the next year or two, will market for scala3 better at that time?

 Consider the code below
 (setq org-sql-files-plist (plist-put org-sql-files-plist task-kwd `(:file_path ,full-filename :filename ,orgfile :dirpath ,(file-name-directory orgfile) :category ,(rc/org-global-prop-value "TASK_GROUP") :title ,(rc/org-global-prop-value "TITLE") :description ,(rc/org-global-prop-value "TASK_DESC") :task_id ,task-id :parent_file ,(rc/org-global-prop-value "PARENT_FILE") :date_added ,date-added) )) 
 Say I need to substitute org-sql-files-plist with org-python-files-plist, but instead of using org-python-files-plist in the code I use (somelist "python-files-list") where (somelist "python-files-list") is set to org-python-files-plist, ie not the value of the variable but the variable itself.
 It is something like passing variables or pointers to variables in procedural languages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could I please get (no pun intended) a simple explanation of <- get? I see this syntax frequently but it is not clear to me as a novice Haskell user. 
 For example in the following code fragment:
 inputFunc :: State Details
 inputFunc = do
 g <- get
 let ifDetails False = ""
 ifDetails _ = "the details"
 return $ ifDetails $ "myString" 'elem' detList g
 ​
 data SecondState = sedondState { 
 detList :: [String]
 }
 If my understanding is correct, inputFunc has no input types and returns a type of State Details.
 <- get does something and sets the output to g?
 The function then returns a blank String "" if "myString" is not an element of g (a String array?), otherwise it returns the String "the detail" if indeed "myString" is an element of g.
 Please correct me if my understanding is wrong. 
 The outstanding question I have is what does "<- get" get? Where does it get it from? And does it set g to this output like = in imperative languages?
 Please help.

 I don't use doom-emacs, but enjoy having doom-modeline installed. The question is whether anyone has been able to configure showing doom-modeline only on the active window, saving screen real state for all the windows that aren't focused.

 This is also the case in emacs -Q:

 I was able to remove the clutter after replacing a line in locate-file-completion-table (files.el::L1007) with nil:

 But I don't know if my change is just a hack or not, as the line was added in 2010 and clearly did not have the same effect back then.
 Why does find-library work like this in Emacs 28?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In org-agenda, when I apply tags to items, the item text (even if it’s just five words) gets a line break after two words or so.
 As you can see in the attached image, the item with the text "Org Party Einschulung" with the tag ":pauli:" gets wrapped, but only after I applied the tag.
 What do I need to change / investigate to fix this?
 https://preview.redd.it/dn83z036ynz81.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d50a88a1368bef752a654269f785c926a07f241
 This is my org-agenda-prefix-format, in case it matters:
 (setq org-agenda-prefix-format '((agenda . "%-12:c%-12t% s") (todo . "%-12:c") (tags . "%-12:c") (search . "%-16:c"))) 
 Edit
 Started emacs with option "-Q" from command line: emacs -Q
 Then ran these lines:
 (setq org-directory "/Users/pragmat1c1/Dropbox/org") (setq org-agenda-files (directory-files-recursively org-directory "\\.org$")) (find-file (concat org-directory "/agenda/" "planner.org")) 
 Next, I opened agenda: "M-x org-agenda RET a"
 I can see that indeed lines get wrapped when "visual-line-mode" is turned on. Otherwise no wrap and and arrow on the right of the tag (when I am resizing frame and make it smaller).
 My findings
 Apparently in my setup 
  
visual-line-mode is turned on
 the items do not get enough width so that they get wrapped when a tag is added to an item
  
Question: Where is the line width for the items defined? How can I increase that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya!
 I've been using doom emacs for a while now and have been mostly happy with it. I've got a bit of spare time now, and have been trying to put together an emacs config from scratch. Not sure if I'm ultimately going to stick with this config or go back to doom for regular work, but I figure it'll at least be a good learning experience.
 Anyways, I've run into some baffling behavior with the general package for key binding. Specifically, once I set a new leader key, it acts in a "sticky" manner eternally. So if I rebind C-SPC as a leader and "C-SPC h" to help-command, it works in that "C-SPC h" works like "C-h". However, any time I use this, it disables the "h" key for the rest of the session. Whenever I type "h" alone, it behaves as though I pressed "C-SPC h". Same with spacebar. In a fresh session, both keys will work normally until I use them once with the leader. After that, the keys are broken until I restart emacs.
 Does anyone have any idea why this is happening and what should be done to correct it? Here's the relevant part of my init.el. Also, please ignore the specific rebindings; this is just an experiment to see what can be done with general and to figure out how it works.
  (global-unset-key (kbd "C-SPC")) (use-package general :config (general-create-definer krm/global-leader :global-prefix "C-SPC") (krm/global-leader "h" 'help-command "SPC" 'set-mark-command))

Do you want to restart it? (y or n)
 Also i have gentoo's rust-bin and the rust toolchain installed at the same time could this be the source of the problem?
 EDIT: Forgot to install rust analyzer It still doesen't work it says:
 (Rust Flymake:wait[0 0] Lens LSP[rust-analyzer:27750] WK ElDoc)
 okay so i just change to a rustic config: https://robert.kra.hn/posts/rust-emacs-setup/
 Now i am having a different issue which i've solved on my previous install but i forgot how i did it:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone!
 I've uploaded packages for Emacs 28.1 to my PPA. Thank you very much to everyone who's filed issues against the GitHub repository (or reached out via email). It's wonderful to know that folks appreciate this effort, and I love being able to give something back to the community.
 Now: on to the good stuff!
 Packages are available for 18.04 LTS ("bionic"), 20.04 LTS ("focal"), 21.10 ("impish"), and 22.04 LTS ("jammy").
 Emacs 28 deprecates Xft and encourages using Cairo/HarfBuzz for font rendering; this build configuration is the one that my Emacs 27 packages were already using, so there should not be any changes there.
 The big new feature in Emacs 28 is native compilation, and as you might expect, these packages enable that feature. The only exceptions are the packages for 18.04 LTS ("bionic"); libgccjit packages aren't available for the version of GCC that ships with 18.04 LTS.
 The only packaging-related update I have to share is that the master branch of the packaging repository now has a README with release notes. I'm going to try to move more notes about the packaging process there over time.
 Enjoy, and please let me know if you have any trouble.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been struggling with getting gRPC to work. As a step I tried to follow along with the official tutorial for client side (in Go, as my clients will be that - though it doesn't matter) and try matching server side with Haskell. So, for now I have this proto file (it might be important that eventually, I will need to use proto3):
 // The greeting service definition. service Greeter { // Sends a greeting rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} } // The request message containing the user's name. message HelloRequest { string name = 1; } // The response message containing the greetings message HelloReply { string message = 1; } 
 Using proto-lens I can generate nice lenses for HelloRequest and HelloReply by following this. However, it is not useful much. I would have to write a lot of boiler-plate for implementing SayHello.
 Therefore, my next best bet was proto3-suite (is that the right one?) Generating the code works nicely:
 stack exec -- compile-proto-file --proto proto/helloworld.proto --out lib 
 Which will give me a very promising Proto.Helloworld with data Greeter = ..., but I simply cannot use it (with stack)..
 It seems that that repo is maybe outdated as the resolver is fairly old, and regardless there are always version conflicts.
 What is the way to go for gRPC with Haskell nowadays? Can someone point me to a code base that is using stack with working builds?

 In the first case, I find this a little awkward. I do an rgrep, hit enter on each entry, make a change, etc etc. This is very slow, and can result in buffers getting left open. What I'd love to do is have rgrep behave something like occur mode's (M-s o) occur-edit-mode (accessed from an occur buffer with e). 
 Is something like that available in grep results? How do you use rgrep more effectively?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a log file that I would like to tail/follow in an emacs buffer, and it also has ANSI escape sequences for color that I would either want to display in right colours or just strip (for display) so that I can read the text. How can I do this? I’ve tried enabling both follow mode and ANSI mode, but when the buffer gets reverted/followed, ANSI mode turns off. Thanks for any help you can give.

 i was constantly searching for the next "big" tool (evernote, onenote, you name it) -> i am lightyears ahead now, at least in my reality ;)
 i was not sure, which IDE to use
 i never regretted, how much time i wasted with other tooling
 i never commited so much into one program, except starcraft, cs and lol ;)
 i regretted to not have a closer look at it, when searching for vim vs emacs and most people would recommend vim to me. i do not regret using some vim, but i regret not to have closer looked at emacs.
  
Emacs is like an interesting person you get to know and each time you are thrilled to know that person more and more.
 What was different or how did emacs change you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am looking for ways to read a book or paper and record my interactions with it. I am phrasing it like this because I don't want to limit ideas too soon and I don't really know the words to describe it more precisely.
 The goal is to not only read a document but to make its information more accessible by - for example - highlighting and linking internally and annotating (thoughts) . But I also stumbled upon concepts like transclusion in emacs. This would allow workflows where the document is included into the annotations, instead of the other way round. 
 So my question is: Do you have a work flow to share that enables you to interact wit documents and record those interactions with the help of emacs?
 Some of my documents are in pdf format, others I have converted to org format.

 (require 'origami) and (origami-mode 1)
 Why can't you directly do the latter? I noticed it works even without requiring the package. 
 I see that any installed package can be activated in a buffer through M-x without requiring it or you can put this in init.el. What is the point of requiring a package? I thought it's similar to import module in python, but it doesn't seem to be. Importing is all that is required in python, no activating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, orgmode has a new org-capture option, :refile-targets. Its description: Temporarily set ‘org-refile-targets’ to the value of this property (link). I would like to take advantage of this new option so I can have different org capture templates refile to different files, but just can’t get it working. I normally set my org-refile-targets as such:
 (setq org-refile-targets '(("~/Dropbox/org/work.org" :maxlevel . 2))) 
 This works fine. So I tried to do the same in my org-capture templates. Here’s an example:
 ("n" "CPB Note" entry (file+headline "~/Dropbox/org/cpb.org" "Refile") "** Note: %? @ %U" :empty-lines 0 :refile-targets '((("~/Dropbox/org/work.org" :maxlevel . 2)))) 
 With this I get the error, “org-refile-get-location: Wrong type argument: listp, quote”. So I tried this next: (list ("~/Dropbox/org/work.org" :maxlevel . 2)). Now the error is “org-refile-get-location: Wrong type argument: listp, list.”
 I have a decent understanding of elisp but clearly I’m missing something here. I can’t find anyone else using the :refile-targets option so my Google/Github searching has not been of much use. Hope someone here has a better idea. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following anti-pattern in my code:
 existsFunc :: Maybe Item -> Item 
 This is part of a larger piece of code that checks if a name is in a Dictionary:
 genFunc :: InputType -> Item genFunc input = existsFunc(Data.Map.lookup input (myDictionary)) existsFunc :: Maybe Item -> Item existsFunc (Just x) = x existsFunc Nothing = error "input missing from dictionary" 
 I would like to replace the above anti-pattern with with ! Map operator, but am having trouble understanding the syntax. How can the ! be applied?
 genFunc :: InputType -> Item genFunc input = ! Data.Map.lookup input (myDictionary) Error: element not in the map genFunc input = Data.Map.lookup input (myDictionary) 
 I also thought that it could be applied in the following way:
 genFunc :: InputType -> Item genFunc input = Data.Map.lookup input (myDictionary) ! input Error: element not in the map genFunc input = Data.Map.lookup input (myDictionary)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/haskell .
 I have been working with SuperRare Labs for more than a year and they are looking to grow the team!
 I know the feelings of the community about NFTs and Blockchains. Those arguments have been said (and said better!) on other threads on this subreddit. Still, I think there are neat pieces of technology on our backend and we have a good work environment where we can do some neat engineering.
 SuperRare Labs is a US based company with US level compensation, fully remote (I am Chilean and I feel in the loop). Technology wise we are into Haskell, GraphQL (template haskell interop), extensible-records, Postgresql and hs-web3. If any of those technologies interest you, please send a message at the forms at greenhouse, in particular on the backend engineer role. Also, send me a DM so we can chat, answer your questions and/or see ways to speed up the process.

I'm looking mostly for experience, so money is not a big issue (as long as I can survive on it). I would appreciate any tips of where to look for the internships and if you know about any/work for companies that offer them I would greatly appreciate any links/contact informations. I can provide my cv and linked in if that would help. Thanks in advance ;)

 Also almost all the key chords in insert mode work as well. Most vim emulators as in VS code give control to the native application in insert mode losing much of vim functionality. But evil does not do this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, my university requires me to use their custom (and worse than default...) latex template for my thesis. Adding custom classes to org mode is documented in several places: https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-arb-tex/#latex-classes However, all that I see require more work than just saying "please use template.cls for export." The template I have to work with is over 700 lines long, and to either manually translate it to a format such as https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-arb-tex/#latex-classes or create a new program to do the conversion, is likely to cause inconsistencies or bugs. At least in the time span that I have available right now.
 Is there a way to tell org mode to just use a specific .cls file during latex export?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I use use-package to install org. This obviously happens when init.el is run for the first time. On this first run, even after a newer version of org has been installed, emacs continues to use the old version of org packaged with emacs (from the second run onwards the newer version is used).
 Is there any way to re-load org during that first run? It ends up causing errors and warning during org-roam installation as some of the functions introduced in newer versions of org (org-roam dependencies) do not load. 
 I have found this, but it seems like a very ugly solution! Any suggestions how this can be better dealt with? 
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IHaskell is super great, especially when run using a notebook in VSCode. However, I've encountered a couple of bugs, and wondered if people had seen the same and/or knew how to fix them:
  
If I try to use diagrams with IHaskell, and use diagram to display a diagram, as shown below, the notebook crashes. ```haskell :extension NoMonomorphismRestriction FlexibleContexts TypeFamilies import Diagrams.Prelude import IHaskell.Display.Diagrams import Diagrams.Backend.Cairo
  
diagram $ eqTriangle 1 ```
 Is anyone else able to display diagrams in a Haskell notebook?
  
I'm using hvega to plot things, but the plots only show when the notebook is viewed in VSCode. On a browser, or in html, I don't see the plots. Is this a problem other people have had?
  
If both of these were fixed, I could use Haskell to make pretty notebooks, with diagrams and plots, as documentation and tutorial material, which is something I'm keen to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I recently realized that the git pre-commit hook does not ensure that only the chunks in the index are part of the worktree when the pre-commit hook runs. Hence, I set out and add some git stashing to my pre-commit hook to fix that myself.
 This is what I ended up with after some google-fu:
 ```sh
 #!/bin/sh # First, stash index and work dir, keeping only the # to-be-committed changes in the working directory. old_stash=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash) git stash push -q --keep-index --include-untracked new_stash=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash) # If there were no changes (e.g., `--amend` or `--allow-empty`) # then nothing was stashed, and we should skip everything, # including the tests themselves. (Presumably the tests passed # on the previous commit, so there is no need to re-run them.) if [ "$old_stash" = "$new_stash" ]; then echo "pre-commit script: no changes to test" exit 0 fi # Run lints/checks/tests/... script/check st=$? echo "got status $st" # Restore changes git reset --hard -q git stash pop --index -q # Exit with status from test-run: nonzero prevents commit exit $st 
 ```
 Now, this works fine when I use it from the git-command line, however, I run into trouble when I commit via magit. It fails with the following error:
 ```
 error: pathspec ':/' did not match any file(s) known to git < normal testing output> error: could not restore untracked files from stash The stash entry is kept in case you need it again. 
 ```
 Anyone have any idea what is causing the difference between git-cli and magit here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently needed to make a minibuffer completion with annotations. The manual says you need to set completion-extra-properties, and I was able to make annotations, my :annotation-function looks something like this:
 (defun my-annotation-fn (s) (let-alist (cdr (assoc s minibuffer-completion-table)) (concat " " .version " " .description))) 
 Now, this works, but the annotations do not show up aligned (because every column in each row is delimited by fixed number of spaces), and that doesn't look very clean.
 Of course, it is possible to calculate the exact number of required spaces for every column in each row, even though it would slightly sophisticate the annotation-function.
 Another alternative (I think) is to extend the prompt for Marginalia and let it do its magic. But then it would only work for those who use Marginalia package. 
 So my question is, is there a convention or a simpler method of aligning the annotations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not too long ago after GCC dropped its copyright paperwork requirement, I heard that the Emacs maintainers were going to do the same (forgot the source, forgive me).
 Are they preparing for that? I believe that dropping it will result in a far more number of potential people and human work for Emacs' development.
 Personally, although I have already signed it as student, I'm not so sure in the future when being employed cause there's a term: contact us when you change your employer.
 Side note: I signed it to propose apply-right-partially, the function was rejected in favor of explicit lambdas. A bit sad at first, then I realized its usage may lead to breakages later: what about when the applied FUN's parameters have optional arguments added to the right? I still hope for Clojure-like's short sweet anonymous function, or at least Scheme's cut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am asking myself if there is a simple way to parse and evaluate a domain specific language, that is error free after type-checking. My Idea is to use Haskell-Functions and Variables to have less work and reduce errors. 
 ​
 I've read about tagless interpreters but I find it hard to convert a string into such an expression and I only saw that here: https://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/TypeCheck.hs
 ​
 That is quite old, so maybe there is a better way of doing it or a library, that is useful for that.
 ​
 I've also read Stitch from Richard A. Eisenberg https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3406088.3409015
 and I liked it very much. In this approach there is also a lot of work to do.
 ​
 I've found very short ways of evaluating typed ASTs here: https://gergo.erdi.hu/blog/2015-02-05-typed_embedding_of_stlc_into_haskell/ and here: https://github.com/shayan-najd/MiniFeldspar/blob/master/Philip/GADT.hs . But there is still a lot working in the conversion from simple ASTs or Strings to these expressions.
 ​
 Is there a even better and simpler way to do that, if the goal is to let Haskell to a lot of work and focus on features that I want to include in my language.
 ​
 Thank you very much for your answers.

Better executable path queries in GHC 9.4 by Fraser Tweedale
I previously wrote about System.Environment.getExecutablePath and how I fixed it on FreeBSD. Unfortunately, this function still has some problems. In this post I explain the problems and introduce executablePath, the solution arriving in base-4.17.0.0 (GHC 9.4.1).
Existential optics by Marco Perone
In this post, I present a way of encoding optics that is different from usual. This encoding, called existential optics, is easier to understand than the other encodings, since it makes more explicit the structure of each optic.

 Also there are some weird graphics glitches from time to time in Emacs that I never experienced on Linux. On macOS I see them all the time. One of them is like Emacs stutters the rendering and than flashes and then it is back. And I am on M1 processor - no other commonly used application has this problem.
 Also, the file permission problems arise when using HELM, etc.
 Is there really so few people using Emacs on macOS?
 Do most of them just use Vim with plugins to achieve what Emacs offer and that is why there is not enough push to solve these issues in the source code of Emacs?
 Or I do miss something else?

gave at Haskell Exchange 2020 (time truly flies). If you prefer
watching it in a talk format, you can watch the
recording. Or you can browse the
slides.
I first conceived of writing (well, talking, initially) on this
subject after one too many person told me “lazy is better than strict
because it composes”. You see, this is a sentence that simply doesn’t
make much sense to me, but it is oft repeated.
Before we get started, let me make quite specific what we are going
to discuss: we are comparing programming languages, and whether by
default their function calls are lazy or strict. Strict languages can
(and do) have lazy data structures and lazy languages can have strict
data structures (though it’s a little bit harder, in GH…]]></summary>

 UPDATE (SOLVED)
 For those who might face the same problem.
 I managed to solve it, in fact it was the Emacs smtpmail library (maybe in combination with a recent change on the server side).
 I added the SMTP server I'm using to the variable smtpmail-servers-requiring-authorization, which is documented as follows:
  
"Regexp matching servers that require authorization. Normally smtpmail will try first to send emails via SMTP without user/password credentials, and then retry using credentials if the server says that it requires it. If the server name matches this regexp, smtpmail will send over the credentials on the first attempt."

 hsResumeBuilder is an attempt at a Curriculum Vitae / Resume generator written entirely in Haskell using BlazeHtml library.
 See my resume as an example, made with this very tool or open the output.html
 file in your browser.
 The concept is a highly-customizable theme-based resume generator, currently supporting one theme.
 I personally use it myself for my own CV, so that if I ever get tired of how it looks, i don't need to change all data to change the looks of it. My data stays safely in a YAML file, while i can go happily about tweaking colors and HTML structure, even CSS files.
 Any new theme is welcome in a pull request, and we gotta figure out the best way to make theme selection customizable from YAML :) 
 I'd welcome any constructive criticism about the looks and also about the Haskell code, and obviously would be thrilled to see PRs.

 Please star the repo while you are there, if you have GitHub account!
 This version adds sending images and files to our iOS and Android apps, and since our v1 release two months ago there were many other improvements:
  
message editing, deletion and replies.
 link previews.
 support for self-hosted servers in the apps.
 instant notifications on Android.
  
The next release will include WebRTC audio/video calls!
 Huge "thank you" 🙏 to everybody who helped us test and improve the apps, and to the whole Haskell community for so much support of this project – we would not be able to do it without you!
 We are building SimpleX Chat to help all people communicate freely with each other, without fear of persecution because of what they said and who they are connected with. Even in democratic countries we all want privacy and freedom from advertising surveillance that relies on our connections – it manipulates us into buying things we don't need, reduces our choices, leads to price discrimination and manipulation of the elections.
 Every messenger app that has your connections can end up leaking them. Even Signal that designed and uses a strong encryption protocol that most messengers use, does not protect your connections, and shouldn't really be considered a "private messenger" – it is a centralised platform that uses phone numbers to identify its users and their connections.
 SimpleX Chat uses the design that allows to deliver messages without assigning any identifiers to the users, unlike any other messaging platform we know of – you can read about how it works on a high level in the last post and get more technical details from SimpleX whitepaper.

 Hey Emacsers,
 I hope you are doing well.
 In the last few weeks, we have dedicated 6 posts to org-mode links.
 Our interest was not only to show the specific features of org-mode links but also to see how they are implemented.
 In this post, the last one about org-mode links, we list ALL the videos, articles and packages related to org-mode links.
 It is unrealistic to think that it is possible to do so. But, we can try. And If you think about any video, article or package that should be part of that list, please do share it in the comment section below.
 Let's go!

 In the short, how do I open a project?

I don't need Projectile if I already know what file I want. What I want to do is say "Open project X", and then from there navigate to the files I'm interested in.
 Alternatives welcome, if you have one that you prefer, because so far projectile seems to be wasting my time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a possibility to record the keys pressed in emacs session & save it in a file (Like macro editor but with timecode).
 Then run emacs with that recorded sequence from a selected file?
 In example, make file with timecode & keys. 
 00:00:01 H
 00:00:01,500 e
 00:00:02 l
 00:00:02,500 l
 00:00:03 o
 In first second it will press letter 'H'. Then half second later letter 'e' and so on.
 It would be amazing feature to make some tutorials about emacs!
 I was thinking I could do similar https://youtu.be/hnMntOQjs7Q Emacs Org Mode Demo 2021 But it would be easier with timecode & keys then record a video.

One thing I used to like with my other selection tools, ido & ivy is that I could write a command in M-x minibuffer and it would ignore the dashes in the command name. I guess there's a way to configure the matcher in Vertico, but googling and searching the github repo hasn't given me the answer I'm looking for so far.
 I wonder if anyone here can help me out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From what I understand. Please tell me which part is wrong. 
 Installing a package through package-install copies the package files into .emacs.d directory. That's all it does. It just sits there and is not loaded during Emacs startup. Eg. package-install evil 
 When you require a package, its code is loaded during startup. So it does slow down the Emacs startup time. But the package is not activated, i.e it's key bindinds are not yet available.
 Eg. (require evil) 
 When you activate a package, it's commands and key binds are available to you as soon as you start up Emacs in each and every buffer. So this slows down start up time, but the slowness should be same as when requiring a package as even if you just require it, the code is still run.
 Eg: (evil-mode 1)

They are trivially fixed with a C-l but it is frustrating. I've tried Windows Terminal Preview and alacritty, but with the same results (although anecdotally, alactritty corrupts slightly less frequently, but that could be just a biased observation). [Why console mode? - when I run using a Windows10 X server I frequently get crashes when shutting/opening laptop lid, so it's more straightforward to run purely in a console than use emacs --daemon and try and reconnect, in which case occassionally the daemon wedges and/or the X-server]
 emac version: GNU Emacs 28.1.50 (build 2, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, cairo version 1.16.0) of 2022-04-04
 Does anyone else see this? Is it a Windows terminal problem, a WSL problem or an emacs problem? Any comments are really welcome before I dive deeper into this rabbit-hole.

 My main issue is that overall, the indentation really isn't two spaces per tab for most web dev stuff.
 Also, as much as I despise VS Code, I really think its better out of the box with indentation and how it presents its Intelllisense ideas via its LSP functionality.
 Would like to borrow some stuff from people's configs to see how else I can tweak my setup because even with Helm + LSP + Company, I'm really not satisfied with the workflow.
 ​
 Even configs with stuff like Treemacs and Projectile would be cool too. Thanks.

 I've come up with this macro-helper function, but I feel like it's probably .... cursed. Let me know what you think!
 (defun +marg (arg) "Return ARG, unless comma-quoted. Then return ARG's value. This function really only makes sense in macros, e.g. (defmacro foo (bar) (let ((bar (+marg bar))) (do-something-with bar))) This will allow a call like (foo thing) to work with the symbol `thing', but (foo ,thing) to work with the value of `thing'. This functionality is probably cursed and probably shouldn't be used." (if (eq (car-safe arg) '\,) `,(cadr arg) `',arg)) 
 The docstring should be fairly descriptive, imo, but I can further explain if need be.

 The socialist publisher Jacobin -- which publishes Jacobin, Catalyst, and, in the UK, Tribune -- has an in-house content, subscriber, and publishing management system written in Haskell. For some new features and improvements they want to make, they'll need a dedicated Haskell full-stack developer, for a fixed, one-year term only, based in NYC but otherwise remote-friendly.
 The position pays up to $75k based on experience and comes with full union healthcare. The ideal candidate is someone who has Haskell experience and who is interested in left politics.
 For more information, for questions, and to apply, see the posting here: https://jacobinmag.com/2022/05/jacobin-is-looking-for-a-programming-fellow/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been writing my dissertation in orgmode using the new citation syntax and engine. For Word export, which my committee demands for revisions, it's been working great. But I want to submit the full diss in a nice pdf, for which Latex is the best option. However, I realized today that when I try to export to a Latex file, the citation gets fully parsed. 
 So from this in the orgmode buffer:
 [cite:Asit Kumar Bandyopadhyay in the Preface of@nyayaratnaBangalaBhashaBangala1991;] 
 I get this in the latex buffer:
 \footnote{Asit Kumar Bandyopadhyay in the Preface of Rāmagati Nyāẏaratna, \textit{Bāṅgālā Bhāshā O Bāṅgālā Sāhityabishaẏaka Prastāba}, Natuna saṃskaraṇa. (Kalikātā: Suprīma Buka Ḍisṭribiuṭārsa, 1991).} 
 This is great for Word but in Latex I'd rather have a \cite command, otherwise I won't get a bibliography with a \printbibliography command in my main.tex document.
 I took a look at the Latex export page of the org manual, but couldn't see an option to change the export. Any ideas?

 executing either code block would result in the following error in the minibuffer

 which i assume is because org babel is stuck in an infinite loop of inserting the references
 in c++ we have header guards to deal with this problem, how do i deal with this in org babel?, i know this might seem impractical at first but the example i provided is obviously very simplified and you can encounter this problem in more practical cases

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using emacs for several years now (coming from vim) and I've found that understanding the basics of elisp can be very helpful, and essential whenever I want to do any customization. Typically I will google what I am trying to do, come across some posts on reddit or stackoverflow, find some sample code (ie. This is the function I wrote and bound to this key to do x and y), and incorporate that into my own emacs config. 
 Here's a simple example, say I want to figure out how to copy the full path of the current filename into the buffer so I can later make a reference to it in my org notes. If I google that, I'll see a dozen different ways to do this and they mostly all work great, but in the spirit of doing everything inside emacs I can't help but wonder... there must be a better way? I feel like there must be some repository of very useful and common elisp code "snippets" where I could just search for "get current filename" and be presented with elisp code I can immediately use, and I feel like that could all be done directly inside my current document and just inserted as a code snippet!? Is something like this at all possible, or are there any useful tools/packages that do something similar? Appreciate any tips :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: I'm a Java guy, so maybe there is an explanation that's trivial in /r/scala, but out of my reach.
 There used to be a couple of hacks to create green threads in JVM, like Quasar. As far as I know, implementing green threads for Java today is made by changing the JVM. Meanwhile, in Scala and before Project Loom:
 from Cats Effects: Concurrency in IO is facilitated by fibers, which are lightweight, interruptible threads that are managed completely by the runtime.
 from ZIO: Powered by highly-scalable, non-blocking fibers that never waste or leak resources
 Well... how? JVM threads are backed by OS threads. Is the Scala compiler inserting context switch here and there in Cats/Monix code? do Scala language construct allow to create green-threads? Kotlin gets coroutines in the compiler, but Cats/Monix are libraries, not compilers. Or Scala libraries can alter the way the compiler work?
 I'm curious...

For example, when reverse engineering it's critical to be able to view the bytes at point as different types of integers and floats. And as far as I can tell, it's even impossible to change the number of bytes on each line (though maybe this can be customized by some undocumented option to the hexl binary).
 Are there any good alternatives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm migrating from Vim and configuring my Emacs config (I use Doom).
 I use PHP and I need to exclude $ from symbol definition, if that make sense.
 In PHP class properties are defined like so private $propertyName = 'something'. And then used like so $this->propertyName. 
 The issue is that when I use * to search for a symbol at point (assume my point is on the property definition, the one with $ sign) the "symbol" to search for is $propertyName hence things like $this->propertyName aren't going to be found in the buffer. 
 I'm not sure exactly where I should look for the fix. I tried to set evil-symbol-word-search to nil which will force evil to search for "word" at point but that's not that great and doesn't work for variables with underscore. That's maybe could be fixed with modify-syntax-entry function but it's all looks like a wrong path to do it. 
 What can I do to tell Emacs (or evil) that a "symbol" excludes "$" sign?
 Thanks

 I was reading about rebinding copy/cut/paste/undo to the standard keybindings of ctrl-c/x/v/z but this apparently interferes with Emacs's default key chords. Is there any way to rebind the key chords to a different key, say, ctrl+d or ctrl+b? In other words, a shortcut originally bound to ctrl+x <some key> will now be bound to ctrl+d <some key>.
 I'm just a little worried that using something like CUA mode will interfere with my ability to use advanced shortcuts that rely on ctrl+x modifier chords later on.

I borrowed ideas from Better Journaling with The Archive (and BitBar). I don’t have Keyboard Maestro and I didn’t want BitBar, but the principles are absolutely sound, so I adapted them to create a single script:
#!/bin/sh
# Open a daily journaling note
# Create the note if it does not exist

ZK_PATH="/Users/path/to-your-notes"
DAY=`date +%Y%m%d`

NOTE="${ZK_PATH}/${DAY}${HOUR}.md"

if [[ -f "$NOTE" ]]; then
    open "thearchive://match/${DAY}"
else
    echo "# Journal Note" >"${NOTE}"
    echo "Date: "`date +"%d %B %Y %H:%M"` >>"${NOTE}"
    echo "Tags: #journal" >>"${NOTE}" 
    echo "" >>"${NOTE}"
    open "thearchive://match/${DAY}"
fi

The script runs from an Alfred workflow. The first time on any given day it creates the note and opens it. Next time, it just opens the note. And as brunoc noted, because the note has a specific tag it is easy to find all such notes and see whether there is anything there I need to act on.
I’m pretty sure that this could be more elegant, probably by testing for the absence of the note rather than its existence. Another nicety would be to capture some input and append it to the day’s note without even opening it. The previous little script might offer a start for that. But hey, it works as intended and that’s good enough for me right now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am processing a list of URLs where spaces have been replaced by "%2F". 
 For example: "https://example.com/query=aasfasdf%2Fapp%2Fuser=test"
 Now I try to create new strings that contain those URLs.
 (format "Name: %s URL: %s" name url)
 and get an error:
 (error "Not enough arguments for format string")
 Apparently the resulting string contains those "%2F" strings, and format cannot fill them.
 Is there a way to provide literal strings to format function and prevent it from trying to interpolate the resulting string?
 Edit: Here is a code fragment that demonstrates it
  (let ((name "Test URL") (url "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FJames%1Qr5z3L.png?alt=media&token=3571-455b-960f-b68acc31faf0")) (message (format "%s %s" name url))) 
 Solved
 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Displaying-Messages.html
  Warning: If you want to use your own string as a message verbatim, don’t just write (message string). If string contains ‘%’, ‘`’, or ‘'’ it may be reformatted, with undesirable results. Instead, use (message "%s" string). 
 So this does the trick:
  (let ((name "Test URL") (url "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FJames%1Qr5z3L.png?alt=media&token=3571-455b-960f-b68acc31faf0")) (message "%s" (format "%s %s" name url)))

 Previously, I'd been making REST API requests using Emacs's built-in url-retrieve-synchronously function, which generates a brand-new response buffer. I wrote a resource-managing macro for it that cleans up the buffer after setting point to the start of the response body and executing the macro body there, returning as its value the last expression in the body. For example:
 (with-synchronous-download "https://api.github.com/.../jobs" (loop for job across (json-read) collect (job-summary job))) 
 It worked well enough, but in order to do things like send non-GET requests, include a request body or extra headers, etc, I had to bind global variables like url-request-method, url-request-data, etc. It just wasn't very …]]></summary>

But I'm disappointed in vscode not being FOSS and I don't like vim that much for developing bigger projects cause I think it can give you headaches. So now, I'm trying to learn Emacs and absorb enlightenment from the wisdom of Stallman and the light of Emacs. But the problem I have with Emacs is it not being minimal. Could I delete all those Tetris and doctor stuff? Why would I need them and why are they there anyways? Shouldn't they be considered bloatwares installed on top of Emacs?
 Yeah I know you might think that I don't know what I'm talking about and I should inform you that I'm totally newbie in Emacs but can somebody help me to understand it please? I think you don't need many of the stuff that are there. Can I make it more minimal or maybe delete some of those stuff from it?
 And another thing: It would be very kind of you to introduce me to a roadmap or a start point where I can begin my Emacs journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to switch most of my software to "boring tech". That is not an insult it is praise. I am tired of a new IDE coming out often, having to learn it, then something else comes along as the new fad and so on. 
 I want to invest my time better by choosing mature, well proven solutions with great staying power.
 Emacs has all of that. 
 I am a bit confused that things seem chaotic, at least in parts. I am wondering if this is my trying to chase down the wrong extensions.
 One I was looking at had been removed from the central repo and moved to a different one and I got confused adding a second repo and gave up.
 There also seems to be a lot that you have a bit of luck getting to work compiling some C code and other (outside of Emacs) requirements. 
 I am thinking I am chosing new, or not popular packages? That for most things everything I nee is in the standard repo?

 As per an HN comment, I think a Haskell developer route might be more appropriate. Anybody out there hiring junior Haskell developers, ideally in London UK? Or recommendations where to look?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, the headline may be misleading.
 The point is that when I press TAB, I get information in the mini-buffer about whether it was expanded or folded.But I can't see anything unless I click into the buffer.If I call the same command (org-cycle) via M-x, it works like everywhere else I'm used to. Hopefully the picture will make the problem clear. I'm running on a Macbook Pro, Emacs29.Anybody? Thanks...

 Now I want this list to be available in the org-agenda view and more importantly to be able to interact with it there. So that I can just open my org-agenda, see the tasks for today (including not only checkboxes but all the TODO's that I set) and mark some entries as done.This way I will have to open my .org file only once a day and set tasks for tomorrow and have all the rest in the org-agenda, while currently I have to check both entries: .org file and org-agenda not to miss anything.
 If you know a better workflow for daily routine - I would gladly check it out. I know that it is possible to press vE in the org-agenda to see that list, yet it's impossible to interact with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Zettlers,
since the expertise concentration on this forum is maxed out I'd be dumb to not posting this question.
I need a new MacBook. But I am not sure what MacBook I need.
There are three options:
The Mac Air M1 with 16GB RAM
The MacBook Pro M1 13'' with 8GB RAM (1 GPU Core more)
The MacBook Pro M1 13'' with 16GB RAM
I don't need big power. I just write, zettle, zoom and similar stuff. However, I'll get more into simple video editing (include some slides, but nothing fancy) which begs the question if I am better off with option (2) than (1). Or if I even benefit (notably) with option (3).
I'd go with (3) if the benefits would be notably. But I am happy with either (1) or (2) if I just need to wait a minute or two until a video is rendered.
Live long and prosper

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 One of the things that my baffles me a lot when trying to wrap my head around Emacs - is the keys for some major modes, remapped by Evil.
 I'm coming to Emacs from Vim (actually, not Vim per se, but the Vim key bindings that I got so accustomed for over the years that I have them turned on in all my IDE's like PyCharm, etc.), so one the things I installed first was Evil.
 But now I've got the problem: for every basic mode I'm trying to understand the major keys are just not there - they are remapped and I don't understand how to easily solve this.
 Examples are: my yesterday attempt to learn Emacs debug, with keys explicitly described here:
 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Backtraces.html
 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Debugger-Commands.html
 Evil changed most of them, how do I understand to what?..
 The same thing happened to me with Dired, Ibuffer and Info!
 The only thing that comes to my mind so far is:
 1) The official manual (and also the majority of the videos and tutorials) describe the _keys_ to press, not the commands behind them. So, somehow, I have to deduce the commands corresponding to that kesy (but C-h k won't work, since the keys are remapped)
 2) I have to then find what new key correspond to that command...
 I don't really understand how to do that in a general way. 
 What am I missing here, how to make Emacs + Evil not impossible to learn for a newcomer like me?

 When I have tabs open, close Emacs, the sessions gets saved. When I re-open Emacs with that session, my tab-bar looks like this:

 The first time I click on a tab, the associated window opens yet the tab-bar disappears. When I re-enable tab-bar with tab-bar-mode the tabs get re-displayed yet the appearance is different:

 ​
 You see the small 'x' next to the tab name? This tab-bar behaves normally though.
 ​
 The initial behavior is annoying with the tab-bar disappearing. Anybody experiencing this behavior too? Is this a 'feature' I have to come by with some init.el settings or a bug I should report?

 Is there an easier way to navgiate to the last closing paren of the sexp to evaluate it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know it's a question as old as time but I've never used either and I've been reading other posts on this and I'm still pretty fuzzy.
 I understand the main complaint about emacs from vimmers is that it's too slow and not quite as responsive as vim, whereas the apparent advantage of emacs is that it's "more" than just an editor and this is where I get lost.
 I've read that emacs has integrated email, browser, calendar, calculator... games? I mean, honest question - who cares? No, really, I'm curious; perhaps there's an answer I'm just not aware of. How often do you use the cal, calc, and email apps in emacs in your workflow.
 Then as far as more killer emacs apps like Magit, to borrow a phrase, "there's an app: plugin for that" in neovim: https://github.com/TimUntersberger/neogit
 What functionality does emacs offer that simply can't be implemented as a neovim plugin? Or perhaps that can't be implemented nearly as nicely?
 Thanks, and sorry for the nth emacs v. vim question that I'm sure you're all sick of.

This Week
I've got an itch. Stealing @Loni's Word Definition Deep Dive and I've applied it in principle to defining "Cognition." I'm first exploring external sources for definitions and synonyms. Then I'll search my ZK for connections, which I expect to be many. Probably the most fun/work, the next stage will be to think of metaphors to fit with the note. I'm calling this a #definition-map.
Class is over, and I have a little freedom for reading and have picked up, Metaphors We Live By by George Lakoff and Mark Leonard Johnson.

 type family XXE k f data EF a f = VarF Int | AbsF Int f | XE !(XXE a f) type E0 = Fix (EF S0) data S0 type instance XXE S0 f = f 
 To use cata :: Functor f => (f a -> a) -> Fix f -> a with f ~ E0 S0 I will need to implement a functor instance like so:
 instance Functor (EF S0) where fmap f = \case VarF n -> VarF n AbsF n x -> AbsF n (f x) XE xe -> XE (f xe) 
 However, this is a bit cumbersome. Is there a way to define something like
 instance ??? => Functor (EF a) 
 ?
 For this case it seems XXE a f ~ f should work but it does not. Now, what happens if I want an instance covering both E0 and E1 with type instance S1 f = Maybe f or similar? I guess I would want something like instance Functor (XXE a) for the general case?
 Is there a way to get this to work? Maybe can I have a higher-kinded type family such that I can use type instance XXE S0 = Identity?

This is my first post on the forum, though I’ve been reading and benefiting from your comments and inputs for over four years now: thank you for that!
My name is Erik, I’m an academic in the field of strategy, technology and innovation management. I have two Zettelkasten in The Archive, one for academic and more general non-fiction work (around 1400 notes) and one for fiction work (around 1450 notes).
The question I have for you is about déjà-vu in your ZK. I very regularly make new notes, only to discover, either when I add them to the ZK or much later, that I already made almost the same note at an earlier date.
Does this happen to you? Do you see it as a problem, or as a sign that the topic is important to you? If you notice such double entries, do you not enter the new note, do you merge them, or do you enter the new note specifically as ‘alternative’ to the other one?
Any other insights are also welcome.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings all! I am brand new to this subReddit, not to mention Reddit in general. If anyone here has the time and the will to lend an ear (or an eye) to my plight and provide me with some much-needed advice, I'd be mostly greatly appreciative:
 ​
 As the title says, I am coming up to the final segments of HPFFP (currently on parser combinators/monad transformers), and I am trying to discern the path forward after finishing this book. 
 Now, here's the caveat: I am NOT a career software developer. This has actually been my first real deep dive into computer programming in general (*prior to getting into Haskell, I had finished the HTML/CSS/Javascript certifications on FreeCodeCamp, but Haskell blossomed into a total love affair beyond my control). 
 So, most advice I see online about what to do after finishing HPFFP could be more-or-less distilled down to "just get your hands dirty writing code in Haskell." But, I feel like the implicit assumption there is that the person receiving the advice already has a decent amount of experience writing computer programs. As for myself, I really have no clue about where to go next; I really enjoyed learning about how all of the concepts from category theory map onto the language (e.g. writing Monoid/Functor/Applicative/Monad instances for custom datatypes and whatnot), but at this point, it's really just pure intellectual enjoyment - like solving a challenging puzzle or something like that. 
 It occurred to me that the natural thing to do would be to try to use Haskell for web development, and I have been eyeballing the Yesod book published by O'Reilly. But, would a book like that already assume that I've done backend development in another language before? If so, are there better resources available in this particular domain? Or, am I just not really ready to start actually using Haskell to accomplish something practical yet?

 import math import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from numpy import matmul as mult q = 1.6e-19 maxerr = 1e-5 ep0 = 8.852e-12 eps = 1*ep0 #12*ep0 kbt = 1.38e-23 * 300 Nc = 1e23 mu = 100*1e-4 dx = 1e-9 xs = np.linspace(0,200,201) * dx NB = lambda x: ( 2.5e18 * 1e6 if 50e-9 <= x <= 100e-9 else ( 1e17 * 1e6 if 130e-9 <= x <= 190e-9 else ( 5e17 * 1e6 if x >= 200e-9 else 0)) ) Jac = lambda E: np.array(list(map(math.exp,-E/kbt))) * np.eye(len(E)) * Nc * q * q / eps / kbt Lap = lambda n, d: ( np.diag( np.concatenate( ([1], -2*np.ones(n-2)/d/d, [1]) ) , 0 ) + np.diag( np.concatenate( ([0], np.ones(n-2)/d/d ) ) , 1 ) + np.diag( np.concatenate( ( np.ones(n-2)/d/d, [0]) ) , -1 ) ) rho = lambda E, d: ( np.array(list(map(NB,np.linspace(0,d*(len(E)-1),len(E))))) - np.array(list(map(math.exp,-E/kbt)))*Nc ) A = lambda E, d: Lap(len(E),d) - Jac(E) b = lambda E, d, b0, bn: ( mult(Lap(len(E),d),np.concatenate(([b0],E[1:-1],[bn]))) - np.concatenate(([b0],rho(E,d)[1:-1]*q*q/eps,[bn])) ) dE = lambda E, d, b0, bn: np.linalg.solve(A(E,d),b(E,d,b0,bn)) SolveE = lambda E, d, b0, bn, err: E if max(abs(dE(E,d,b0,bn)))<err else SolveE(E-dE(E,d,b0,bn),d,b0,bn,err) plt.plot(xs,list(map(NB,xs))) plt.savefig('dope.png') plt.clf() plt.plot(xs,SolveE(np.zeros(201),dx,1.5*q,0.0*q,q*maxerr)/q) plt.plot(xs,SolveE(np.zeros(201),dx,1.0*q,0.5*q,q*maxerr)/q) plt.savefig('energy.png') 
 I'm mainly stuck on the conditional check for error which requires carrying out the relatively expensive operation. The way it is written here ends up computing the same result twice for each recursion, is there any syntax in Haskell that lets me reuse the result and still get tail-call optimization?

After some research, Seafile appeared to be the best choice for synchronizing notes, since I can't trust Dropbox anymore and want to keep everything hosted in servers I can control. It has the particular advantage of supporting  WebDAV natively (thus it works with 1Writer) and being easy to set up.
I also did some tests with emacs running with a GUI using TigerVNC + Screens for iOS:  the performance is better than expected, even when running at full Retina resolution.  Terminal mode with Blink.sh provides a better general experience though.
I still didn't make BerryLan play nicely to configure the Wi-Fi through Bluetooth (I'm not sure if it is supposed to be compatible with Tailscale). Maybe writing a client/server BT application with Pythonista?]]></summary>

 Specifically: The buffer is created by imenu-list (an awesome-sauce package for those who work with deep-nested org files), and I'd like to hide the modeline for this buffer. Adding a hook to imenu-list-major-mode-hook does not seem to do the trick. Any ideas how this could be done?

 Advanced Haskell. Reserved for the cream of the crop, not just 1% of developers, but 1% of Haskell developers. Keywords like "proof", "verification", "logic", etc. come up. I have no idea what these are (they might as well be speaking Chinese to me).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello:
 I'm fairly new to elisp, but I'm trying to customize the text inside a "begin_comment" block in orgmode, as seen in the screenshot here
 I would like to have the same type of face as the code above (no colors).
 This is my config:
  (custom-theme-set-faces 'user '(org-block ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch)))) '(org-document-info ((t (:foreground "dark orange")))) '(org-document-info-keyword ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch))))) '(org-link ((t (:foreground "royal blue" :underline t)))) '(org-meta-line ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch))))) '(org-property-value ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))) t) '(org-special-keyword ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch))))) '(org-tag ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch) :weight bold :height 0.8)))) '(org-verbatim ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch))))) '(org-indent ((t (:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch))))) '(org-table ((t (:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch))))) ;; check if this works '(org-comment ((t (:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch) :height 0.8)))) ) 
 As you can see at the end of the block, I tried the "org-comment" keyword there, but it does not appear in any documentation or configuration anywhere. Is there any way to configure that, or a place I can look for any documentation?
 Thanks for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read the topic about Emacs being a user friendly and how it's userbase is low compared to vim (3% to 25%). I know Emacs is a powrful tool, I use it org on my phone, dired, its shell, vterm, etc. But, I got to this point because when I, 6 years ago, migrated from Windows, wanted to have all my tools to be open-source. To get the basic functionality on Emacs, like select, copy, paste, you have to learn its special keybindings. I know you do that in vi/vim too. But, focus on Emacs being friendly and then users being able to explore lisp and expand their configuration. Make Emacs a 'bait', kind-of mentality. 
 There are a lot of starter configs, but none currently compares itself to an modern IDE, doesn't make org-mode feel like Typora or some paid/closed application, but Emacs has the potential. 
 The last point made, I know there are, at least brought up in the discussion, how the GUI app was made and how it functions, that makes it limited in many aspects. We have hooks, like after-change-major-mode-hook, so we can have diffrent UI depending on the major mode (one for org, python, c, etc), and get inspiration from ides. 
 And, lastly, all of this together, except for the architeture for the GUI, may make users think that Emacs got lost somewhere. We all know that we love Emacs because it can be what we want. All of us got an all white screen and made it ours, behave like we wanted. How enabling cua-mode(brought up inthe discussion) can change this? Imo, users simply would have a better start in UI, but get all the expandability that Emacs has.
 ​
 Anyway. I did some lisp to get my functions, I write my articles in org, but have no time to thinkering about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone! I'm building a websocket server for a collaborative document editor in Haskell, as a hobby project. Right now I am getting it to work with just two client connections, but I would like to make that scale very soon.
 I'm mainly using jaspervdj's websocket library, which I will then serve with wai/warp. The jaspervdj's chat server tutorial forks a new process for every client connection, and have it serve that connection until it is closed, which I don't think would be as concurrent as I would like it to be. Ideally, I would like to have a way to
  
multiplex sockets (like select() from C), so that I only fork to serve connections that actually have messages arrived.
 or go through sockets in a round-robin fashion, skipping the ones that do are not ready.
  
I'm having trouble finding a way to do this; mainly, I'm not sure how to check if a client connection has messages ready. My main concern is that receiveData is blocking (according to the docs), so there is no way to skip msg <- receiveData conn if it has to wait because it hasn't received anything yet.
 What would be the ideal/scalable way in Haskell for handling potentially a large number of long-running websocket connections?

 tl;dr
  
simplified subsumption seems to make common code I write in industry clunky for no good reason in lots of places
 
Are others concerned with motivating what seem like "pointless lambdas" to new hires or students for simple tasks?
 
Are there more real world advantages that make these frequent annoyances worth it?
 
How is quicklook impredicativity useful in industry?
 
 The biggest advantage seems to be that laziness is more predictable.
 However looking at commits fixing simplified subsumption errors on github I see very common patterns in industry Haskell now need an explicit lambda for "reasons" such as:

 Hey org-mode fans,
 In this post we saw that we can open org-mode links everywhere, not only in org-mode buffers, thanks to the command org-open-at-point-global.
 Specifically, we demonstrated it with:
  
the link [[help:pcase]] which links to the help buffer describing the macro pcase and,
 the link [[info:elisp#Current Buffer]] which to the elisp info node "Current Buffer".
  
We left aside two things:
  
How can we store a link in the org syntax to the specific "place" (in Emacs) I am visiting?
 When we've stored an org mode link with the command provided by org-mode, how can …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the official docs on keybinding conventions, https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Key-Binding-Conventions.html it says "Don’t define C-c letter as a key in Lisp programs", and while "C-x" isn't mentioned, my understanding is that anything beginning with "C-x" is reserved for Emacs itself. It also states "Sequences consisting of C-c followed by any other ASCII punctuation or symbol character are allocated for minor modes".
 However, many downloadable packages provide functions that are intended to be globally accessible, independently of major of minor modes. Many packages that I use, such as Magit, rg, projectile, suggest global keybindings to access their functionality (or even provide functions that will set "default" keybindings in the sacred "C-c letter" space!)
 These are all over the place - Magit uses "C-x", Tide uses "M-," and "M-.", and so on. The most common case seems to be, the package recommends binding some functions to key combinations in the "C-c letter" space, but doesn't actually perform the binding itself.
 I'm wondering if there have been any discussions of this topic in the emacs community, and if there is any consensus or tentative directions proposed.
 Thanks!

 The documentation lists default key bindings but not the mouse bindings. As I am relatively new to Emacs,
  
How can I display all bindings lsp-mode binds (mouse+keyboard)
 How can I specifically rebind the existing ctrl-mouse-1 to another combination?

I assume that I cannot use default akka system of Play, because the only thing I can custom is changing the actorSystem name. Therefore I cannot change the ` actor.provider to "cluster", Play ignores my cluster config and keep the system remain "local". Following the document, which describe how to use my own system, I have several things to do. Can someone explain why "Pass in the correct classloader from the Play Environment otherwise Akka won’t be able to find your applications classes" ? And give me the detail example of this. I decided to post here because there's no one online in r/akka Thank you !

 But can't we just write new functions in elisp which make it possible to have functions which only do the movements or operators and then combine them as in vim completely ignoring the emacs editing commands like "kill-region" etc? 
 I guess evil already does this. But since this kind of "feature" is not built into emacs as such, does this cause an inherent limitation or difficulty?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an academic I have been interested in learning orgmode and using it in my work flow.
 So it goes like this:
 1- Lot of reading and tutorials
 2- It seems I have to learn EMACS first, and to be comfortable with it I must develop enough muscle memory and remember the keystrokes
 3- This is too slow, I am still not as effective with it as mere notepad++
 4- This is taking too much time, ok now I am losing interest..
 5- Ok, I am too busy and need to get shit done, let me table this for a while
 6- Rinse and repeat steps 1-5
 ​
 ? I guess I will take another stab at it and perhaps reach enlightenment this time around. EMACS and it keystrokes are my bottleneck I think, I was never very good with memorizing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! After 7 years exclusively with Scala backend I'm about to start a new project that needs to have a proper frontend. I'm a bit FP maniac and cannot imagine myself getting back to JavaScript or TypeScript. I'm super rusty with everything frontend-related, but was considering three options:
  
Elm - I like the simplicity a lot; have some concerns about its future
 ReScript - kind of Scala's uncanny valley: on one hand semantics are very close, on the other it's just not it, having hard times to get used to syntax; among all options seems to be the most future-proof
 Scala.js - obviously the comfort zone, but no idea if it's a viable option for the frontend
  
My requirements are:
  
I have very limited resources - so don't have time to write own libs (perhaps just bindings), which means I really want to use all JS libs possible (React, sliders, widgets etc). This is where I have the most concerns about Scala.js (scalajs-react looks great, but seems to be the only big thing ported properly) and most sympathy for ReScript
 It has to be an Electron app. Seems to be possible with all options, but wanted to raise since it means the bundle-size doesn't matter (although performance does!)
  
So, my question - is it worth to try out Scala.js (with scalajs-react, I think) or go with more conventional options? With scalajs-react is it possible to integrate existing React UI components?

You can type the form in the scratch buffer, and then type LFD (or C-j) after it. The result of evaluating the form will be inserted in the buffer.
  
But I just get the new line instead of form value being inserted in the buffer.
 I thought it could be due to my evil mode or evil escape mode but disabling them also didn't work. 
 Typing C-h k C-j revealed that C-j is bound to electric new line function but even disabling electric mode didn't work. What's wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a couple of functions to enlarge and shrink the current window when there are two windows left | right of each other.
 (defun b/enlarge-window-horizontally (times) "Enlarge window horizontally by 10 columns instead of 1. Using prefix argument to multiply the effect." (interactive "p") (enlarge-window-horizontally (* (or times 1) 10))) (defun b/shrink-window-horizontally (times) "Shrink window horizontally by 10 columns instead of 1. Using prefix argument to multiply the effect." (interactive "p") (shrink-window-horizontally (* (or times 1) 10))) 
 For argument let's say the point is at the end of the line.
 If I shrink too much, the point remains visible (which I like) and I get little arrows in the gutter indicating the text is truncated "off screen" to the left. That's good. 
 If I enlarge the window again though, the point remains fixed, those arrows remain and the text is still "off screen". 
 Now If move to the beginning of the line, then back to the end of the line, the full text is visible once again and the arrows are gone.
 I've tried getting my functions to do that last part for me but it's failing: 
 (defun b/enlarge-window-horizontally (times) "Enlarge window horizontally by 10 columns instead of 1. Using prefix argument to multiply the effect." (interactive "p") (enlarge-window-horizontally (* (or times 1) 10)) (let ((saved (point))) (beginning-of-line) (goto-char saved))) (defun b/shrink-window-horizontally (times) "Shrink window horizontally by 10 columns instead of 1. Using prefix argument to multiply the effect." (interactive "p") (shrink-window-horizontally (* (or times 1) 10)) (let ((saved (point))) (beginning-of-line) (goto-char saved))) 
 Those additions have no effect on the arrows or the text truncated off-screen.
 Why don't those additions to my functions force the off-screen text to come back into view again - like when I do that manually?
 More importantly how can I get them to do that for me?

 I am continuing my experiment with Org mode meetups and online debugging.
 Anyone who wants to discuss and/or debug Org-related issues is welcome.
 If you want to provide improvements to Org, but feel overwhelmed about the contribution process or the vast Org codebase, we can touch on that as well.
 This time, I plan to talk about some Org mode internals. Specifically, the newly added folding engine org-fold.el
 Note that using microphone and/or camera should not be required. Jitsi does have chat.
 The time will be the same: 9pm SG time (4pm Kyiv; 2pm London; 9am New York). Sat, May 7
 I will post the link to the meeting one hour before the meeting start.

Thanks to that, they catch lots of attention from the functional programming community.
Still, you can have a hard time understanding how they work just by looking at data declarations and type definitions.
In this post, I present a way of encoding optics that is different from usual.
This encoding, called existential optics, is easier to understand than the other encodings, since it makes more explicit the structure of each optic.
This is not new and is well known in the category theory academic circles.
Still, these ideas do not seem to appear in libraries for languages like Haskell, Purescript, or Scala.

 I apologize if this has been dealt with before, but I wasn't able to find an answer to my question.
 I have the following lines in my config file:
 (use-package org :config (setq visual-line-mode t) (setq org-support-shift-select 'always)) 
 Yet, when I open an org mode file, neither visual-line-mode nor org-support-shift-select are active. I'm sure I'm missing something simple, but I can't get either of those to work when org mode loads.

The problem is that there are a bunch of faces where the color of the text doesn't show up against the background. One of them is variable-pitch. I assume that variable-pitch face is pretty ubiquitous so I am surprised I am having this problem and that I can't find others mentioning this. Has anyone else had this issue?
 A small screenshot of the text displayed with variable-pitch font under doom-vibrant theme. 
 A screenshot of my local configuration for the variable-pitch face in case someone notices anything I am missing.

 EDIT: Actually the issue seems to be not with doom-themes at all but with the variable-pitch face (see screenshot under default theme)
 ​
 Text with variable-pitch theme under default theme.

 Could this be due to my font choice?

 EDIT2: Seems it was due to the use of the Cantarell font for variable-pitch... Removed, seems to be better. I don't understand fonts at all...

On my system, Cabal is acting up, leaving me unable to install split onto my system. I decided to just try to build a simple split function rather than go through what I would need to do to fix cabal for the moment, but I'm not really sure how that's supposed to work. I wanted to try to treat the IO String coming from the file as just a list of characters, but even that is beyond me, apparently.

 What would the proper way of splitting an IO String on a delimiter (specifically ',') be?

 Hey Emacsers,
 What a great day to talk about EMACS :)
 Let's set the scene!
 We've just written a new command named my-new-command that we've added to our init file ~/.emacs.d/init.el (or whatever init file your are using except org-mode file).
 To write our new command we had to look at the help of the macro pcase and the elisp info node "Current Buffer".
 Now let's say we want to keep the links to these help and info buffers in comments near to the definition of our new command.
 Is is possible? How do we do that?

 sealed trait Order { def id: String def action: Unit = this match { case Order.Paid(_, _) => // do A case Order.Packed(_, _) => // do B case Order.Shipped(_, _) => // do C } } object Order { case class Paid(id: String, paymentId: String) extends Order { def pack(boxType: String): Packed = Packed(id, boxType) } case class Packed(id: String, boxType: String) extends Order { def ship(trackingNumber: String): Shipped = Shipped(id, trackingNumber) } case class Shipped(id: String, trackingNumber: String) extends Order } 
 I considered a couple of options, but couldn't find the best one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am posting this here to start planning for solutions once the YAML front-matter option is removed.
 Why remove YAML?
 I had a lot of loose code to support both TOML and YAML exports and it worked OK so far. But that implementation wasn't generic enough to support more planned features in ox-hugo.
 I prefer TOML over YAML (but that's a discussion for another day) and so I decided to pick just that and develop a generic library that would convert Lisp data to TOML. That was roughly a week back when I wrote this post: https://scripter.co/defining-tomelr/.
 Fast forward to today; I ended up creating tomelr.el and I wrote about it in https://scripter.co/presenting-tomelr/.
 The end-user wouldn't typically care if the front-matter was in TOML or YAML because that front-matter is mainly for Hugo's consumption. But it would be more of a ox-hugo maintenance headache if I were to keep supporting both.
 And so YAML support will be going away ..
 ox-hugo v0.11.0 Release
 https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/releases/tag/v0.11.0
 Why am I posting this here?
 If you are an ox-hugo user and set org-hugo-front-matter-format to "yaml", try removing that customization (or set it to "toml") and see if the latest version of ox-hugo causes any problem for you.
 Theoretically, it should make no difference in the final website created by Hugo. But if you do see any issue, please report it on https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues.

 I want to write a README.org for a gitlab repository. Most of it 'just works' <3 However, there are some things I am not able to figure out and I was wondering if the more experienced folk here might have a tip or two. Some issues I am facing:
  
The headings do not get anchor links. The README is quite long, and I would really like to have anchor links and perhaps even some sort of a TOC.
 
I cannot figure out how to create internal links. For instance, [[*heading 1][heading link]] does not work.
 
More an annoyance than a limitation: I am using inline-code markup for commands like mv ~/xyz ~/abc. The markup for this would be ~mv ~~/xyz ~~/abc~. This is not rendered correctly by gitlab. 
 
 I would be very grateful for helpful links, tips, and suggestions. 
 Cheers!

The IDE showed its definition (see my ugly screenshot in comment ) as java code. The subproject at the same place with the lib can be used all class normally. How can I build a "real" scala lib that can be used normally in other scala project?Thank you for reading !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends, I'm learning Haskell with the goal of programming in Plutus / Cardano. I'm currently trying to install a Cardano node following this: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal/blob/56898031b9f55608521ccb6d7f616579856d52b7/docs/get-started/installing-cardano-node.md#macos
 ​
 I have a M1 Monterrey with arm. 
 Initially I had troubles in the libsodium` step "./configure", where I had this error:
 checking for gcc... clang checking whether the C compiler works... no
 ​
 After searching in internet, I found that uninstalling brew llvm, and installing Xcode made this step works. But then at this step:
 cabal build all
 I get this error from the terminal: 
 Make sure you have installed LLVM between [9 and 13)
 ​
 Anyone has this error, or was able to run the Cardano node in a M1? This is my which clang:
 /usr/bin/clang
 ​
 Thank you!

A bunch of packages I've found have all been abandoned or haven't been updated in a while, with the implied cause being changes to the authentication method.
 Here are a few methods I've seen:
  
Twittering mode: Sounds like this was the best way to use Twitter a few years ago, but looks unmaintained. Does anyone still use it?
 
nntwitter: Uses gnus, with every user you follow becoming an individual feed. I've tried it, and while it kind of works, I follow ~200 people, so it takes 30 minutes or so to refresh. Plus I want to create a single time-ordered feed to read, and haven't worked out how to create a virtual group to do this yet.
 
gnus-twit: From larsmagne, which also uses gnus. Has anyone else tried it? Is it secure now that it uses Nitter?
 
 I found this post from yesterday when I did a search of the subreddit, haven't gone through it yet.

 But I don't see how to mitigate this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example, org mode defines org-mouse-map. As far as I understand, this map is used context-sensitively, it is only active on links. So I could use, for example:
 (define-key org-mouse-map (kbd "C-l") 'org-open-at-point) 
 This means that I can use C-l to open a link. But if the point is not on a link, C-l will does its original function. This works as intended.
 However, it doesn't work if I try to use an evil keybinding which is only active in normal mode:
 (evil-define-key 'normal org-mouse-map (kbd "RET") 'org-open-at-point) 
 If it worked, I could use RET to open a link when I'm in normal mode.
 Some additional info: if the point is on a link, and I execute (evil-normalize-keymaps), then RET starts to work, but it will try to open links everywhere, not just on links. If I execute (evil-normalize-keymaps) when the point is not on a link, then RET doesn't work afterwards. So it seems that (evil-normalize-keymaps) is affected by where the point is.
 Is this a not-implemented feature of evil?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a new package providing improved continuous scrolling in pdf-tools and doc-view (please read instructions first). This is the successor of the pdf-continuous-scroll package. Making it a new package (instead of an update), was necessarry because this package provides a general 'display engine' which can be used also by other packages, like doc-view.
 Besides having extracted the 'display functionality' into a separate package, the code and functionality of the engine has been simplified, so that it is (even) easier to understand and maintain, and also it should increase compatibility with complementary packages (like pdf-tools and doc-view).
 The engine works very fine, although I would be very happy if anybody has an idea for a solution of the remaining (minor) issue described in the README. It seems to be working quite well also with most/all pdf-tools-modes, although it is not straightforward to make everything work flawlessly. Despite, the minor issues, I guess it works quite fine already for most people. Happy scrolling!

 I made it yonks ago so that I could do extract data from an Aeson Value using a simple query syntax like so:
 value .! "[{key1,key2}]" :: [(a, b)] 
 More documentation on Github.
 Also included in this release: 
  
QuasiQuoters for compile time checking of queries, so you can write [quick|[{key1,key2}]|] for more safety
 Better definition of how it is supposed to work, and better tests
 Same great performance (somehow faster than using Aeson directly in included benchmarks, not sure how that works tbh)
 Array indexing, ie you can write: "[[.]3]" to get the third element of each sub-array. You can also get a range with "[[.]3-6]".
  
Enjoy!

 Today I struggled with a confusing type error for a couple minutes before I realized that this is incorrect! Data.Semigroup defines First and Last differently:
 ghci> import qualified Data.Semigroup as S ghci> :t S.First S.First :: a -> S.First a ghci> import qualified Data.Monoid as M ghci> :t M.First M.First :: Maybe a -> First a 
 Maybe (S.First a) has the same behaviour of M.First a, because Maybe's Semigroup uses the underlying type and the semigroup for S.First is \a b -> a.
 Re-exporting almost everything and then adding two incompatible definitions still seems a bit unfortunate, though.
 I couldn't find any mention of this name clash online, maybe reading about this saves someone else five minutes.

 I like the idea of having a central local repository on my computer for mail (and calendar) - just different ways to interface it (either emacs or thunderbird). My understanding is that offlineimap and notmuch replicate your email archive separately from what exists say in thunderbird, and nowadays it's necessary to compose HTML emails for which I would use the thunderbird editor.
 Anyone have any suggestions (cross-platform, or just Windows at the moment) to integrate the two? "Emacs everywhere" seems to be a Linux solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working in different projects with files with similar names and structure, it's hard to know from which project each file is when switching buffer (using ivy-switch-buffer).
 For example, I have the following files/buffers open:
 /project1/Delivery/Package.ext /project2/Deliveries/Package.ext 
 I tried to use the Uniquify package to remedy this, I set it to show 1 parent directory like this:
 Delivery/Package.ext Deliveries/Package.ext 
 But since the projects share similar file names and locations, I don't always remember if the file is from a project or another, and showing more parent directories would take the whole mode-line.
 What would be your suggestion to solve this issue?
 I thought about placing the project name (from projectile-project-name) before all buffers' names, but I'm not sure how to do that.
 I also tried ivy-rich but I thought it is a bit slow and cluttered. There's also the bufler package that I want to try, but it's not installing properly from MELPA, so I'm still looking for a good solution.
 My current workaround is to work in different frames, and use projectile-switch-to-buffer, but sometimes it would be good to quickly switch in one frame.
 Appreciate any help and suggestions. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m responsible for making a performance test framework for our enterprises data layer. 
 My requirements are:
  
There will eventually be several “scenarios” we are interested in the performance of our application under, but starting with just one
 The scenario should be repeatable and consistently arrange the “state of the world” prior to each test to isolate performance issues to code as opposed to changes in underlying data
 Each scenario starts, should run a set of “actions” that create side effects the application should respond to. Some actions run in parallel, some serially.
 Measure certain things
  
I have a decent mental map of how to do everything but #3. Previously (in c#.Net) I achieved this by modeling the problem (different applications) as a graph — for example:
 Run Action A Then Run Action B, C, D When B is done kick off E When C is done kick off F When D is done kick off G
 While it seemed like the right way to go about this, it always felt unnecessarily complicated and harder for others to follow for what should of been such a simple thing. 
 Other considerations: The main “performance” concerns of my application is how it responds to CRUD events in the database. I had looked at Gatling, but it seems much more focused on web-app requests and I’m not sure how it would help me to mitigate my particular performance concern 
 Any advice on the SIMPLEST way to achieve such a goal?

 For those that also want this I can post - I installed nix-on-droid https://github.com/t184256/nix-on-droid - I could manage to install the emacs overlay https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay - intsall xserver with xsdl https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=x.org.server&gl=US - latex preview and everything works with tectonic (so that you don't have to download gb and gb of data for latex distribution)
 and it freaking works!! and it works well, the emacs version I tested is
 GNU Emacs 29.0.50 (build 1. aarch64-unkown-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.30, cairo version 1.16.0)
 If many people are insterested I can write a blog post about it too. It would ahve greatly helped me as I have not seen it anywhere.

Wanted to share that article with you in case you tweak fonts a lot. It's from a UX study firm.
TL;DR:  reading on the web is fastest with Garamond (serif font) on average. It's not the fastest per se.
Personal highlight 

  
Second, and worse, users don’t know what’s best for them, so they can’t choose the best font, even if they were given the option to customize their fonts. In this study, participants read 14% faster in their fastest font (314 WPM, on average) compared to their most preferred font (275 WPM, on average).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Control.Foldl provides
 either :: Fold a1 b1 -> Fold a2 b2 -> Fold (Either a1 a2) (b1, b2) 
 It only works for one Either, but we can generalize it to an arbitrary number of Eithers like this:
 infixl 4 <+> class Profunctor p => Shawarma p where wrap :: b -> p Void b (<+>) :: p a (c -> d) -> p b c -> p (Either a b) d data Pair a b = Pair !a !b instance Shawarma Fold where wrap x = Fold const x id Fold step1 begin1 final1 <+> Fold step2 begin2 final2 = Fold step begin final where step (Pair acc1 acc2) xOrY = case xOrY of Left x -> Pair (step1 acc1 x) acc2 Right y -> Pair acc1 (step2 acc2 y) begin = Pair begin1 begin2 final (Pair acc1 acc2) = final1 acc1 (final2 acc2) 
 A test:
 test1 :: Fold a d -> Fold b e -> Fold c f -> Fold (Either (Either a b) c) (d, e, f) test1 fold1 fold2 fold3 = (,,) <$> fold1 <+> fold2 <+> fold3 
 And we can have more instances, e.g.:
 instance Shawarma Tagged where wrap = Tagged Tagged f <+> Tagged x = Tagged $ f x instance Shawarma (Forget r) where wrap _ = Forget absurd Forget f <+> Forget g = Forget $ Either.either f g instance Applicative g => Shawarma (Joker g) where wrap = Joker . pure Joker f <+> Joker a = Joker $ f <*> a instance Decidable f => Shawarma (Clown f) where wrap _ = Clown lost Clown f <+> Clown a = Clown $ chosen f a 
 If we replace Either with (,) we'll get
 (<#>) :: p a (c -> d) -> p b c -> p (a, b) d 
 which can be used like that:
 test2 :: Fold a d -> Fold b e -> Fold c f -> Fold ((a, b), c) (d, e, f) test2 fold1 fold2 fold3 = (,,) <$> fold1 <#> fold2 <#> fold3 
 but that's just
 (<#>) :: Biapplicative p => p a (c -> d) -> p b c -> p (a, b) d p <#> q = bipure (,) id <<*>> p <<*>> q 
 So given that Shawarma is kinda Decidable in its first argument and Applicative in its second one, does it also have some non-tasty-sounding category-theory-inspired name?

 GNU Hyperbole 8.0.0, the Epiphany release, is now available on GNU ELPA. Hyperbole is a unique hypertextual information management Emacs package that works across all Emacs modes, letting the computer do the hard work while you benefit from its sophisticated context-sensitive linking and navigation capabilities.

 I use the simple but very convenient code-cells package to run python cells. E.g. with the Spyder IDE, the cell where the cursor is currently in has a different background color, and I'd love to have that in emacs. Would you have any idea on how to do that? 
 I guess one idea is to find the closest "# %%" pattern up and down from cursor and change background color in that region, but I have no idea how to implement this, also for it to change back to the normal background when the cursor is not in the cell anymore...
 Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have found one major limitation in Emacs that I cannot circumvent. Its ability to expand text is limited. abbrev-mode can expand words into other words or phrases. For example, I can ask Emacs to expand "edv" into "Emacs Developmental Version." However, it can only expand single words, not phrases. For example, it does not appear to be able to expand "Emacs Developmental Version" into "edv". (Or change a phrase like "a lot of" into "many". However, in Sublime Text, one can expand phrases into words and other phrases, using the snippet feature. One can also expand whole sentences. The popular plugin yasnippet does not overcome this limitation.

 The difficulty with vim is not memorisation. Vim commands are all very mnemonic and follow a consistent pattern of naming, with a verb object syntax. The difficulty here is to the grok the language concept of vim and thus requires some cognitive effort and intelligence.
 The difficulty with emacs is that you have to memorise hundreds of unrelated shortcuts which do not follow any conistent pattern of naming let alone "the language model of vim. " So it is easier for those who mindlessly memorise stuff but find it difficult to understand deep concepts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Lens allows us to view and update a structure s/t in terms of an aspect a/b.
 If two different structures can be viewed in terms of the same aspects a/b, we can model a partial mapping between them. In other words, we can take an s/t structure and alter it with contributions from a u/v structure, OR we can take the u/v structure and alter it with contributions from the s/t.
 Is there a name for this way of combining two lenses?
 Here's one implementation:
 -- metaphor :: Lens' s a -> Lens' u a -> (s, u) -> (s, u) metaphor :: Lens s t a b -> Lens u v b a -> (s, u) -> (t, v) metaphor ls lu = \(s, u) -> (set ls (get lu u) s, set lu (get ls s) u) 
 I'm calling the combined (s, u) -> (t, v) "metaphor" because to me this looks like this kind of metaphorical thought:
  
An argument is like a building in that both have foundational parts 
 If we reinforce the foundations of a building by adding concrete, it becomes more robust 
 So we can reinforce the foundations of our argument by... to make it more robust
  
I've explored it a little more at this gist https://gist.github.com/gusbicalho/a3a38e07aba55bc69f6f164ddde092f7 but I'm sure that if this thing is useful at all, someone must have written about it already 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I would like to replace all occurrences of the string t| with t̚.
 The problem is that ̚ is a special character that I use for phonetic transcriptions, it's the "unreleased stop consonant" and it has the hex code U+031A.
 I can insert it by using M-X insert-char then typing #x031A but is there something that I can use to replace t| with t̚ across all the document?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The deeper I delve into Emacs, the more I come to appreciate its vanilla keybindings over vim's and the reasoning behind them. The problem is, even after relatively short sessions(lasting around thirty minutes or so) of editing, I always find my pinky aching(and kinda tired as well) and setting caps lock as an alternative control key hasn't helped much, the ache's still there.
 So I've come here asking you, O followers of the righteous way, what kind of tricks have you adopted to make yourself more comfortable when using Emacs that don't involve splurging on super expensive ergonomic keyboards?

 Is it possible to generate a clocktable report from an archive file, which take into account the inherited tags (ex: ARCHIVE_ITAGS property) making it possible to match like a regular tag?
 I have multiple org files, one for each client, with an according #+FILETAGS. It would be great to get clocked times per client, without needing to have an archive file per client.
 Is this possible without going into elisp sorcery?
 Or am I doing this wrong?
 Another question: is it possible to match ARCHIVE_CATEGORY properties?
 Thank you

 what if I’m not online or having network issues?
  remote has to by definition be slower than local
  I don’t control configuration
  I don’t control updates/changes

 This question is more for my own knowledge rather than an absolute need.. Is there a way to clear the whole doom emacs history / cache, if not what is the way of doing it manually i.e removing / purging those files that store them so it gets regenerated. I am a bit paranoid in a sense that to know where some stuff is like zshhistory for my zsh.
 Example - Reset Doom emacs remembering Recent files (Space + f + r)
 Update: I figured this much atleast.. that there is a recentf file inside cache directory but there are other files as well which seems a bit scattered but good to know tho.
 Thanks in Advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been dealing with this issue for months, I use straight to manage emacs packages, so that I am always at the latest version of org mode.
 I am currently at org 9.5.3. I have been constantly dealing with a lot of missing function definitions. Most of them are due to compatibility reasons, e.g. some other packages depends on org-mode may use an old name for certain kind of functions. But this should not be an issue at all, because there is an "org-compat.el" which takes care of them.
 However, I find that, org-compat.el was never loaded in my emacs, even though I have (require 'org) in the first place, in org.el, org-compat was already required. I even tried to directly load the org-compat.el myself using (require 'org-compat). But none of the definition in the file was loaded.
 I wonder if that has anything to do with native-compilation. Anyone has an idea of how to fix this issue? I have to manually go to the org-compat.el file every single time after I restart emacs to make it works.
 Not only was org-compat.el not loaded, the org-macs.el was also not loaded. It has become a nightmare for me to use org-mode in the recent months.

Most time you don't need that level of abstraction. (i.e. create a Monad and benefit from all the predefined stuff). And yes cats give you lots of interesting transform for free, but it feels most time you just don't need them, and when you need them, it's straightforward to impl.
 I'm thinking may be only library developers will need to learn the fancy libraries like cats, does this make sense?
 p.s. could you consider cats is for Scala is like Boost is for C++?

 AUCTeX and cdlatex are tried and tested packages in supporting the composition of TeX-documents. However, with the advent of LSP-servers, like TexLab and digestif, there is another (viable?) option to compose TeX-documents. 
 What are your experiences with LSP-servers for composing LaTeX? Do you prefer those over AUCTeX? If so, why? 
 Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences.

 So far I've tried these packages, but all of them seems to be missing something:
 Indent guide (https://github.com/zk-phi/indent-guide): 
  
Doesn't highlight the indent guide of the current block in a different face of the other lines
 
Doesn't keep all the indent guides, only the parents and current block
 
 Highlight indent guides (https://github.com/DarthFennec/highlight-indent-guides):
  
Doesn't show the indent guide on empty lines
  
Highlight indentation (https://github.com/antonj/Highlight-Indentation-for-Emacs)
  
Doesn't highlight the guide of the current block, instead it highlights the whole column
 
Doesn't highlight the guide of the block when inside parens
 
 Do you guys use this feature? While searching for a solution, I was surprised that some people wanted to remove it from their editors/IDE.
 Maybe I missing something, so if someone has a suggestion or workaround to get the indent guides like in other editors, I appreciate.
 Thanks!

So I'd have to have an emacs frame in focus to play and pause. Second, it generated a cache file with metadata for my music that took very long to load on starting emacs as a client and created a big delay shutting down emacs. It was 350mb whereas the cache file for cmus with the metadata for the same Music library was only 7 mbs. I was using emms with mpv. Does anyone know why it generates such a huge cache file? Thanks.

1. Two things captured my attention. First was the writing and use of humor to deliver the message. The second idea that swirled out of the Ambassador of Cool was the notion of eufriction. @ZettelDistraction lifted it from Bob Doto2, but it would have been lost to me if he hadn't shared it here.
Below is a zettel I created from this interaction. I've reproduced it in its entirety so you can laugh, critique, criticize, slam, skip any part or theme in the zettel, or ignore the whole thing.
The numbered entries below are direct quotes from @ZettelDistraction.
I found this along with Bob Doto's essay2, a lively ZK exercice. I spent a couple of hours diving deeper into eufriction. Seeing the gaps in my ZK. I have another zettel which is still providing a little eufriction. Maybe I'…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently learning both emacs and webdev. I'm trying to not go too far down the emacs configuration and customization rabbit hole out of the gate so that I can actually progress on the odin project. But its too intriguing to not build out some automation and QoL implementations. 
 A recent fix I implemented showed me the power of being able to quickly customize built in or added package functionality to be what I want it to be. But it raised the question on best practices for doing such things. 
 The example in question was navigating tags with web-mode and emmet-mode both enabled. There is some built in navigation for elements but I found one bit confusing/inefficent.
 ex: 
 I use ul>li*5 to make a list with 5 items in it. It smartly jumps between the first <li></li>. I enter some text and use "C-c C-e n" to move to the next element. But its at the start of the next element i.e. before the < in <li>. So I wrote a very quick and dirty macro in lisp and bound it to "C-x t". You can see that very crude and terrible implementation below. 
 My core question here is whether such an implementation is better as a macro that calls the web-mode-element-next command and makes adjustments from there or is it better to just go in and make changes to web-mode-element-next and call it normally. Granted I'll utimately make a better solution that moves the point to the end of tag after > probably finding the character with regex or something. I just don't know lisp well enough yet. 
 ​
 My next-tag function - very crude just showing a code structure sample.
 (defun next-tag() (interactive) (web-mode-element-next) (forward-char) (forward-char) (forward-char) (forward-char)) (global-set-key (kbd "C-x t") 'next-tag)

 I have deleted all the folders generated by GHcup and installed it again. Good. When trying to install IHaskell using this command (within the downloaded folder): "stack install --fast" I get this nasty error:

 I do have LLVM installed. As a matter of fact I tried to lower its version to <13; I have this in the path: /usr/local/opt/llvm@12/bin:/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin
 Yet it keeps failing. I don't want to give up on Haskell, but it has been a nightmare to have the proper tools working. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I used a lot evil before and it's great, but unexpectedly viper mode does a good job also. Personally I am not a vim hacker, I just frequently use dd, yyp, o and O in command mode and all of this work very smooth. Also in "console" modes (eshell, vterm, shell and ansi-term) I didn't encounter major issue. One thing that I added is viper-want-ctl-h-help variable to not-nil because help keybindings (C-h) doesn't work by default which I use often. My current configuration: ~/.emacs.d/viper:  (setq viper-inhibit-startup-message 't) (setq viper-expert-level '5) (setq viper-want-ctl-h-help 't)  and in init.el:  (setq viper-mode t) (require 'viper)  I encourage you to try :) link to manual

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realize Evil vs. traditional emacs bindings is a thoroughly discussed topic. I'm currently poring over numerous discussions in a search of this subreddit. But one discussion I haven't seen is what set of bindings is best supported/implemented outside of the standard text-editing experience. The discussions naturally tend to focus on which bindings are better for each user for editing text. But what about for everything else? 
 For instance, qutebrowser is a fantastic web-browser built for keyboard focused input. It uses vim style bindings natively, but can be configured to use emacs style bindings (and there exists a community maintained configuration file to do just that). A possible issue however with attempting to use emacs style bindings for qute browser is that any features you do use, such as god-mode, might require significant manual configuration to implement. Firefox has addons for vim style experiences (I haven't found an up to date and not abandoned addon for an emacs style experience in firefox). 
 Emacs has its functions for almost everything, including email clients, terminal/shells, and file management. These would naturally tend to be best supported using traditional emacs bindings, because in my experience, evil-mode, while fantastic, often lacks somewhat in documentation for the various things it's implemented in. But dedicated applications may offer support for features not easily replicable in emacs currently. 
 Overall, this seems like something of a wash so far. but perhaps I'm missing something. What has your experience been with emacs or evil bindings outside of emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know there are many posts that are similar but they are dated. Given PGTK and WSL2, technology support has improved I wanted to summarize my experience and get feedback from the community on their experiences in stability and performance. These are now the available methods I see to install Emacs on Windows:
  
Binary from Berkeley FTP (general compilation & slower performance)
 msys2 binary from Berkeley FTP (faster with native compilation)
 Native compilation with "master" release (29.0.x) using msys2 (native compilation with customization + ImagicMagick for eg.)
 WSL2 using package manager (general compilation, no GUI)
 Source compilation on WSL2 (custom compilation, with GUI, uses 2 containers)
  
If using binary on Windows,
  
Fast performance
 Windows support poor in drawing and refresh
 Missing Linux commands produce some inconsistency in experience
  
If compiled or using msys2,
  
Faster performance
 Windows support poor in drawing and refresh
 Instability of Emacs (part native, part cygwin) and missing Linux commands
 Magit is slow
 File access is smooth
  
If WSL2,
  
Slow performance
 Smoother windows performance
 Instability - random crashes
 Magit kicks ass
 Windows files more jarring to access
 Networking issues especially if on a VPN
 Copy and paste is not native (hacks available)
  
The best experience I've had thus far is native compilation of Emacs 29 with msys2, but while the performance is good, I am running into issues with 'Too many files open' after editing multiple projects (which is not LSP or Magit).
 What's working for you?

 Started with Emacs only yesterday. Originally briefly used Neovim, later Vscode with Vim keybinds. Needless to say I'm now using Doom Emacs.
 I'm totally and utterly new to Doom Emacs, having read and watched nothing but the absolute basics. I've made a small to-do list (in Org mode, yes sir) for myself of things I need to prioritize setting up if I wish to use it as a text editor for work. In the Doom init.el file I've uncommented ":csharp" under languages. Synced and restarted Doom. I now get basic highlighting in cs files, but not much else. I don't know what else this does.
 My intuition was to assume it probably didn't install omnisharp, so I got the omnisharp-roslyn package from the AUR. Added it to my path. From here on out I'm not sure what to do. I know I probably need a lsp client, but not much else.
 Any help is appreciated.

 For comparison: https://i.imgur.com/eE54LAK.png
 Specifically I wanted response. to show the Body function but it wasn't showing up and that got me confused.
 Edit: Had to reinstall all LSP packages and now it shows better completions. It seems I have to do this every time I restart emacs which is strange. But at least it's moving in the right direction. Thank you all for the replies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whatever I changed my $HOME/.clang-tidy, the editor always shows the same output.
 For example, I want to hide the diagnostic output like "Parameter name 'xx' is too short, expected at least 3 characters [readability-identifier-length]" in clang-tidy
 And this is my current clang-tidy --list-checks | grep readability-identifier-length output:
 > clang-tidy --list-checks | grep readability-identifier-length readability-identifier-length 
 and in emacs, flycheck-list-errors shows: flycheck.png
 Now I'm adding -readability-identifier-length to my $HOME/.clang-tidy file's Checks arguments list to disable checking it:
 Checks: '-*, clang-analyzer-*, readability-*, modernize-*, -clang-analyzer-osx*, -readability-identifier-length ' 
 And below is my current output:
 > clang-tidy --list-checks | grep readability-identifier-length > 
 The check is hidden, so the config file should work after changing, but my flycheck-list-errors output does not change, no matter if I execute lsp-restart-workspace or restart emacs.
 And I've confirmed that there is no other clang-tidy in the parent directory except $HOME/.clang-tidy.
 this is my sysinfo

 It seems like emacs should be able to connect using oauth2 (e.g. https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/87h7g5llp1.fsf@ust.hk/T/ ). I don't want to keep a local copy of all my email, so have been using gnus (which has up to now been working really nicely).
 This guide appears to get the authentication working
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/61060/how-to-make-email-in-emacs-work-with-an-oauth2-requirement
 but attempting to read email through gnus, I then get the helpful error message
 nnimap (work) open error: ‘’. Continue? (y or n) 
 which makes debugging rather difficult.
 Does anyone have a working configuration for reading Office365 (or any imap email with oauth2 authentication)?
 Any suggestions gratefully received!

 Worse is that this can make your configs package definition order matter which is something I put a lot of effort into preventing.
 If the package author thinks that their keybindings are useful then they should give the user an explicit opt-in setting.
 I don't mind built-in packages doing this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a post about this over a year ago and there were a few people interested, but nobody followed through and contributed to the project so I'm back again to find fresh faces that might be interested :)
 This is for a game called PlanetSide 1 which has officially shut down, but is now a community made emulator being written in Scala. This game is an MMOFPS and is being built to work with the retail client of the game with no access to the original source code. It's amazing how much the small group of devs have done in their free time to get the game to where it is now, but there are some elusive bugs that have been problematic (plus a number of features to still implement). We'd love for it to be an MMO again, but more dev support seems to be the only way to make that a possibility with limited time of the 2-3 devs.
 Here's where you could come in. The repo is here: https://github.com/psforever/PSF-LoginServer I'm not one of the devs working on the server code due to lacking those skills, but I am involved in the team and help where I can and can get anyone in touch with the right people to get plugged in and up to speed. The community Discord is also here: https://discord.gg/0nRe5TNbTYoUruA4
 How to make it sound more enticing... Do you want 100s or 1000s of people thanking you for your amazing dev skills to make this once flourishing game be populated again with players from around the globe? Do you want to see your code come alive and potentially break the Guinness World record for the largest FPS battle (current record is the game's sequel PlanetSide 2 at 1158 players)? Do you want to challenge yourself and put one more feather in your cap and resume that will definitely get you that next 6 figure gig? Join us

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I have the following ADT:
 data Method = Move | Say | Attack deriving (Show, Eq) 
 and a function that pattern matches on this ADT:
 perform :: Method -> IO () perform (Move) = putStrLn "Moving forward..." perform (Say) = putStrLn "Saying something..." perform (Attack) = putStrLn "Swinging sword..." 
 Now, let's assume that I want to add another function that "overrides" the behavior of perform but only on specific cases. For example:
 moveSlowly :: Method -> IO () moveSlowly (Move) = putStrLn "Slowly moving forward..." moveSlowly m = perform m 
 This pattern is known as the Decorator Pattern in OOP languages.
 Is there a way for me to generalize this behavior and possibly even compose these "overriding" functions? For example, let's say I have another function:
 attackWithAxe :: Method -> IO () attackWithAxe (Attack) = putStrLn "Swinging axe..." attackWithAxe m = perform m 
 Ideally I would be able to "compose" these 3 functions using something like
  moveSlowly <|> attackWithAxe <|> perform 
 preferring the first match found from left to right.
  
One possibility is to create a record of functions where each field corresponds with one constructor. I turn perform into a record with the default implementation and then I can override each behavior at will using a record update. When I actually want to perform an action just I extract the function from the final record.
 This kind of works, but implies code duplication (ADT constructors = Record labels) and I'm not sure how to "compose" from left to right.
  
Thanks to @MorrowM_ for the recommended design. An example app is available here: https://github.com/emlautarom1/HaskellSnippets/blob/master/Decorator.hs

 Hey Org mode lovers,
 In the article Hyperlink (wikipedia) we can read that a hyperlink "is a reference to data that the user can follow by clicking".
 Do you believe me if I tell you that with Org mode the data we refer to in a link can be a buffer in magit-revision-mode (from magit package) showing us a specific commit of some git repository?
 For a non-Emacs user, it's not that you can or can't believe it, it's just that this sentence doesn't make sense.
 But for me (a regular Emacs user like you), when I read that sentence I think:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm writing a client codegen for a Servant API definition. I get all the types that appear somewhere in API definition and generate their definitions in the target language.
 However, I have a problem getting type parameters from the generic representation of types.Specifically, when I have
 data Rec a = Rec { field1 :: [a] } deriving Generic1 data RecInt = RecInt { field1 :: [Int] } deriving Generic, 
 the kinds Rep (Rec Int) and Rep RecInt are exactly the same (modulo type/constructor names). The problem is when my codegen sees the type Rec Something in the API definitions, it doesn't know from the Rep type that a parametric foreign datatype is needed. I could, in principle, generate two datatypes, i.e. Rec_Int and Rec_Text, from Typeable 's typeRepArgs but it doesn't seem elegant for me. Is there any way to peek type parameters from datatype?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have set my org-agenda-custom-commands to (among others) this:
 ``elisp (setq org-agenda-custom-commands ( ("x" "Scheduled tasks with Prio" ((tags-todo "+PRIORITY={A}" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Scheduled Prio-A TODOs") (org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'unscheduled)))) (tags-todo "+PRIORITY={B}" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Scheduled Prio-B TODOs") (org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'unscheduled)))) (tags-todo "+PRIORITY={C}" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Scheduled Prio-C TODOs") (org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'unscheduled)))) (tags-todo "+PRIORITY={D}" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Scheduled Prio-D TODOs") (org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'unscheduled)))) (agenda))) ;; snip
 ```
 Now I would like to hide all tasks scheduled in the future. I can do this via
  (progn (setq org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'future) (setq org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options t)) 
 But this affects all of my other org-agenda-custom-commands. I would like to limit it to just one custom command. 
 So how can I modify my custom command so that it hides the future tasks?
 Edit
 I have created a function to toggle future entries, but I'd like to incorporate it in the custom-command, if possible.
 Here is my function for toggling future items:
 elisp (defun ugt-org-toggle-future-items-in-agenda-view () "Show/hide future items in org-agenda views." (interactive) (if org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled (progn (setq org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled nil) (setq org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options nil) (org-agenda-redo) (message "Showing future scheduled items in org-agenda.")) (progn (setq org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'future) (setq org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options t) (org-agenda-redo) (message "Hiding future scheduled items in org-agenda."))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wasn't paying attention and my emacs got updated to 28. Fine, I'll bite the bullet and go with it. So I updated all the emacs libs and all seems to be okay.
 Except my org-mode capture seems to be broken. I have clock-in enabled in my template, but after entering all the data and C-c C-c, I get this:
 ** Test :2022:2022_04:MORE:TAGS: :LOGBOOK: :END: 
 In other words, the CLOCK: line is missing from :LOGBOOK:
 It used to be:
 ** Test :2022:2022_04:MORE:TAGS: :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2022-04-28 Thu 12:25]-- :END: 
 or something like that (can't reproduce), but the CLOCK line was added with the current time as the start time. Any ideas on what might be wrong? The template is defined as:
 ("h" "Hours" entry (file+headline "~/Data/hours/log.org" "Hours 2022") "* %? :%<%Y>:%<%Y_%m>:%^g\n" :clock-in t :clock-keep t :empty-lines-after 1) 
 And yeah, no clock has been started. Pressing C-c C-x C-o tells me so...
 Another small but quite annoying change is that on starting the capture I get a prompt to select tags. It used to be that pressing TAB after some characters would autocomplete the TAG and add a trailing colon (:) which made it possible to immediately select another TAG. It now only completes the TAG, so I need another action to start typing the start of the next TAG which is annoying. Any way to get the old behaviour back?

 I have a pet project in org-mode that reads some data from a text file and arrange them nicely, but I'm currently using a way too complex process to do this, involving PostgreSQL that makes my org-mode export kinda slow. I think it would be faster to replace all the SQL quarries with Elisp and that would also reduce my dependence on other software and keep everything within Emacs.
 Basically, I would need three things and if anyone is willing to help me with hints, idea or code snippets, that would be great:
  
Read a text file (over 6000 lines long) in, I suppose, a list; or a list of lists?; the text file is fixed-formatted, ideally the reading process would acknowledge that;
 Count some list elements (atoms, I guess?) and have the results available as variables across the org-mode file;
 Create org-mode tables with list elements of my choosing (n-th elements from the m-th list, p-th elements from q-th list and so on).
  
Is this doable in Elisp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: if you just read a paragraph and having no clue what's this question is about but you'd like to learn more; I think this post by Chris Wellons perfectly explains what structs are and why are they useful.
 
 I'm dealing with a third-party package that uses Structures - cl-defstructs. 
 One of the slots is :read-only t. I need to override that. I need to find a way to change the value in that slot and then pass the structure to a function, essentially "deceiving" that function.
 Let's say I have:
 (cl-defstruct (toy (:constructor toy-create) (:copier nil)) (color nil :read-only t)) 
 Somewhere within that third-party package, it creates an instance of toy, e.g.:
 (setq stupid-toy (toy-create :color 'red)) 
 Now, let's say I need to change :color to 'green and pass this "new object" into some function.
 I'd try overriding slot-accessor function - toy-color, right before calling that function:
 (cl-labels ((toy-color (x) 'green)) ;; now, whatever within (break-it) asks for toy's color, it should be 'green, right? (funcall 'break-it stupid-toy))) 
 It seems that doesn't work. My fake toy-color fn doesn't get called. Maybe because :color is read-only?
 What are my options here? I cannot use copy-toy because copier-fn is disabled (see above) Can I create a new struct type that inherits from toy through :include option, but :color no longer read-only?
 How do I create/clone a new struct from the old one?
 Remember, in my example, the struct has only one slot; the real struct type that I'm dealing with has over dozen of slots - I need to find an elegant way of cloning the struct, changing a single slot value and keeping remaining slots intact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember having read about a tool (package, some elisp on a blog post, not sure) that enabled one to help evaluate options eg. during a meeting.
 Essentially the way it worked: one would create a few entries in orgmode, add some semi-freeform attributes (eg. 'price:25') in their text body, and the tool would extract these formatted tags and summarize then into an org table. The use case was to help decide on several options with many criteria while discussing them.
 That's all I remember, and I did not find that thing (attribute, table, summarize, chose are too generic). I found org-choose.el and org-collector.el but they don't work on the inline type of attribute.
 anyone knows that thing? Otherwise I'll have to roll-up my sleeves and start elisping...

 So a couple weeks ago I decided to make the Evil switch, and I've been giving a full-throated effort to trying out Doom. I'm not too impressed yet. I mean, they did a good job making Doom what it is. Terrific job, really. I don't particularly love the evilness though.

 I've converted a pdf file containing a table into a text file and try to parse the lines into a structured object. So there is no field separator other than space or eol :-| That's the problem!!!
 To illustrate the problem, I've build here after a simplified example of a line with a label and a double.
 The (simplified) line contains a (fairly) complex label with commas, alphanum characters, space, and periods followed by a double. No way I do it, the label parser is too greedy and consumes the double in the last position:
 parseTest labelP "a label with digits, comas and dots, followed by a float 4 <O.R.> 1.12"
 $ unexpected end of input : expecting a word, aFloat, or white space
 The parser should not take 1.12.
 Could you please, tell me where I'm wrong ?
 Thanx 
 And here is a snipset of the code.
 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} module Main where import Data.Char (isAlphaNum, isDigit) import Text.Megaparsec import Data.Void (Void) import Data.Text (Text) import qualified Data.Text as T type Parser = Parsec Void Text labelP = T.intercalate " " <$> (word `sepBy1` spaceChar) <* lookAhead (space <* isFloat) word :: Parser Text word = takeWhile1P (Just "a word") isCharLabel spaceChar, dotChar :: Parser Text spaceChar = T.singleton <$> satisfy (== ' ') dotChar = T.singleton <$> satisfy (== '.') isCharLabel :: Char -> Bool isCharLabel c = c `elem` listChars || isAlphaNum c where listChars :: String listChars = ",<>." isFloat :: Parser Text isFloat = takeWhile1P (Just "aFloat") isDigit <* dotChar <* satisfy isDigit

I did that and removed ~/.emacs.d/ altogether. The first time I start emacs everything is fine. However, ~/.emacs.d is recreated and I get a session file and auto-save directory in there. The next time I start the init file isn't read at all. Removing ~/.emacs.d and restarting fixes that. I could put a symlink in ~/.emacs.d but that doesn't seem right -- what am I doing wrong?

 On a related note, if I evaluate a snippet of (python) code which I know will produce an error in the python REPL this error does not appear in the #+RESULTS drawer. Is it possible to make it appear there?

Writting, whatever we write fiction or non-fiction, is also a matter of technic and language mastery. But what does that mean "language mastery" ? Is it a talent to use awesome rare words ? I don't think so. From my point of view (which is questionnable, as the rest of my further presentation), it depends on a lot of factors and one them is the accurate choose of words.
Intro : lexicons and my works
While writing my novel in French,  I've found myself stuck in search of synonyms, words, expressions, a never ending quest for using lively semantic fields of words. This is a wast of time : while in search, my ideas fade away. It is especially prononced when I write about feelings, like the love story from my novel.

 word, spreadsheets, calculator, photo tools, games etc. 
 Since chrome is a javascript interpreter at its core (like emacs is for lisp) , people extend it/ abuse it to perform so many things in chrome itself using web applications. 
 I always kind of disliked web apps and since my intro to linux, I have found many command line tools to replace some of them and they are so much better. So I guess, while chrome does a "good enough" job being a general purpose workspace for most people, other user friendly or "FOSS" applications would do a better job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got this book two hours ago, zoomed through and finished reading. There are some good bits here, for sure: I will certainly pay more attention to headings in my notes. Also, for the intended audience of that book---students who must study for a test, and need to learn that material---it is likely useful and a good read. I might even recommend it to a high schooler.
That said, my note's title is from the perspective of what utility I perceived for me.  The advice seemed pat, too cut-and-dried, proclaimed with a finality that stuck the wrong cord in me. When I read the bibliography, I found something very curious for a book from 2018: the references by decade are: 7 from 2010s, 39 from 2000s, 62 from 1990s, 50 from 1980s, 18 from 1970s. Nothing wrong with old references: I have cited 19th century books often enough and once a 17th century book in a paper in computer science, but the relative balance caught my eye.  These 80s/90s skew is curious, although a tad more explained by the original date of publication (2007). Surely more ink has been spilled on this topic this decade, some refining the cited works, others casting grave doubt on some other cited works? FWIW, I have a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science and am quite familiar with some lines of research here and which I find rather dubious (won't name names, sorry).
So, some good stuff here,  no doubt about it, great material for a longish blog post, but the hefty 250+ pages that it is is a stretch.
I normally don't write bad reviews, preferring to keep my mouth shut. But this has been strongly recommended here---enough for me to purchase this---so I felt obliged to add a counter argument.  Just my 2¢.
Best regards,

How do you actually send pull requests in projects like emacs and org-mode which use the mailing lists instead of hosted vcs solutions like github, gitlab or gitea. I know it is a trivial thing for the veterans of opensource but I'm of that generation that uses the github type solutions which can handle issue tracking and pull requests in an obvious manner. I'm not trying to compare or complain the two types of development but I honestly could not find any resource that explains how to contribute using mailing lists for first timers . Reporting issues is obvious enough but how does one get started with submitting patches or sending pull requests.

 {-# LANGUAGE DeriveTraversable #-} module Zonk where import Control.Monad (ap, join) import Data.Void (Void) data Type x = TypeVariable x | Int | String | Arrow (Type x) (Type x) deriving (Show, Functor, Foldable, Traversable) instance Applicative Type where pure = return (<*>) = ap instance Monad Type where return = TypeVariable TypeVariable x >>= f = f x Int >>= _ = Int String >>= _ = String Arrow σ τ >>= f = Arrow (σ >>= f) (τ >>= f) -- substitute all type variables substitute' :: (String -> Type String) -> Type String -> Type String substitute' = substitute substitute :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b substitute = (=<<) 
 The issue with this though is that substitute is pure, you can't error out if you don't want to allow free variables and you can't index your variable if your using mutable references as your type variables. This can be fixed by using the traversable instance alongside the monad instance.
 -- substitution all type variables allowing effects zonk' :: Monad m => (String -> m (Type Void)) -> Type String -> m (Type Void) zonk' = zonk zonk :: (Monad m, Traversable m, Applicative f) => (a -> f (m b)) -> m a -> f (m b) zonk f e = join <$> traverse f e 
 Aside from being a neat of doing variable substitution, zonk's type is really general. Could it have other uses?

 instance Ord X where compare x1 x2 = compare x1.third x2.third

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand functors well since I've read they are important to understanding Monoids and had a thought that I'm not sure is accurate. Is it accurate to view functors as much relating to the map function as it is to relate it to the idea of a map such as a hash map? Functors are almost always explained and shown examples with the map function because obviously a functor defines it's mappable behavior when the map function is applied to it. But my understanding of functors as a type where when a function is applied to it, it morphs the underlying data and returns a functor of the same type seems to me like a map structure where the keys are the f a and the f b are the values. Does that sound reasonable or am I misunderstanding functors in a bad way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been thinking a lot about Haskell pedagogy. The best way to learn something is to at some point do something that applies the new knowledge. To learn Haskell is to learn for a purpose. That purpose could be just to understand functional programming or computer science in the abstract, yet even that eventually requires application of concepts at some level. 
 There is another variant of the posted question which is, what domain was the catalyst for you learning Haskell (either because of a compelling application or just because you could)? Understanding either variant of this question can lead to a pedagogical approach focusing on teaching Haskell+application as a way to jump start intuition and to understand the language’s patterns and capabilities for newer learners and seasoned learners alike.

 import scala.util.parsing.combinator._ class SimpleParser extends RegexParsers: def word: String => Parser[String] = _.r def word_whitespaces: String => Parser[String] = word(_) <~ word(" ") object Testing extends SimpleParser: def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = print(parse(word_whitespaces("meow"),"meow and then wof")) 
 My goal from in this is not the parser itself, but understanding <~ which I think I do.
 But it seems that word_whitespaces is checking the string starting from "and" without minding the whitespace, which I concluded by seeing this:
 [1.6] failure: string matching regex ' ' expected but 'a' found
 meow and then wof
 Why isn't the parser matching with the whitespace, and instead skipping to "and"? It seems as if the whitespace after matching with a regular expression is perceived as delimiter, which I didn't directly asked for it to be the case.

As far as i know GHCup shouldn't be necessary and it worked fine till now without it. The description of the Haskell package in VSCode says i just need to have stack in my path for stack-based packages, which i have. So i have no clue what's going on. Should i just install GHCup in parallel to Stack?

 This hides file info, puts the tag at the beginning, hides the tag at the end. The only thing missing is changing the font of tag, so instead of it being regular, green, I'd like it to be black. Is there a var which I could target?

 this doesn't work and to work these IO actions would need to be modified to accept a IORef as argument, i may be missing something but at least that seems unnecessary it seems like i could just have code like

 Hey Emacser,
 I hope you are doing well :)
 In this post (2022-04-04) we talked about search options in file links, link abbreviations and the implementation of the command org-open-at-point.
 My goal was to walk the path from pressing RET (if you have org-return-follows-link set to t) or C-c C-o on top of the abbreviated org link
 [[emacs:lisp/simple.el::(defun next-error (&optional]] 
 to the file lisp/simple.el in the Emacs source code (cloned locally) with the point at the beginning of the function next-error.
 We have seen that this path follows the following "call stack":

There are probably a lot of caveats with GHC itself on ARM that I won't go into detail here, maybe u/angerman can say more. The ghcup binaries itself have been built on a Fedora ARM docker image, so there's no static linking yet (needs a bootstrapped alpine arm GHC first, which we don't have).

 My idea is create a FUSE application that reads from the API and presents its contents as a "virtual org file", a file that appears like a normal file but it is implemented via FUSE. Is this approach too overkill or should I just go ahead and implement it? I have nothing to lose and this is a personal endeavor, this is not from my main job or something very important at all.

 Previously, VSCode downloaded new HLS binaries automatically. The big new exciting change is that we now use GHCup and can manage the following Haskell Tools for you: HLS, GHC, stack and cabal. To install HLS binaries automatically, make sure you have ghcup installed!
 The first time you use the new Extension you will be asked whether you want to manually manage your Haskell Toolchain binaries or GHCup should take care of it as it sees fit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working on a compiler project managed using Stack. As it's currently set up, I have test-specific dependencies (e.g., hspec etc.) attached to each test suite, rather than declared as a dependency of the compiler itself. The project is hosted on GitHub and I set up some workflows to run tests for PRs etc.
 However, I've encountered a number of pain points during the development process relating to building and testing:
  
CI takes a really long time to run (5min for what is still a small project). It spends most of its time rebuilding all of the dependencies. I tried cacheing it according to advice I found here, which helps with just a plain stack build step, but Stack still seems to insist on rebuilding all the test dependencies every time the action is run.
 
stack test tries to rebuild the whole project after I run stack build, eating into local development speed. This is an open issue. The suggested workaround of building with --test --no-run-tests still incurs noticeable build time overhead because it also rebuilds all the test suites.
 
 I'm wondering if folks here have suggestions for best practices for setting up Stack projects, with respect to improving build times for both CI and local testing? Or if people could point me to well-established Haskell projects managed with Stack, that I could look to as examples? (A lot of the bigger projects I've looked at seem to either use just Cabal, or use Stack + Nix.)

 Note, the display-line-numbers-width setting doesn't fix this, increasing it just shifts the misalignment to the right.
 The only other relevant configuration I'm using is global-display-line-numbers-mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried out PGTK on the master branch to see how native wayland is coming along, but was very disappointed. There's extreme lag when moving the mouse around between items in dashboard-mode (they're supposed to be highlighted when hovering over them, but this highlighting is laggy), and my CPU usage spikes when i move the cursor around a lot (eg, by holding down an arrow key) in a buffer. Does this happen to everyone? I am also using native compilation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a casual question, I was wondering how other people have their code editing environment setup for Haskell.
 For example, I use a mix of Vscode and Sublime 3 (I paid for my Sublime license so I feel like using it still). My setup is pretty vanilla, I have syntax highlighting and I use the terminal panel to run ghci or cabal repl. I also use the code snippets feature to autocomplete things like language extensions and deriving statements.
 I am curious about what other quality of life features other people are using.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to set up elfeed-score for some arXiv feeds -- in the manner of this blog post. The scoring and sorting work out great, but the adjust-tags rule (described here) for labeling posts which have a score higher or lower than a certain threshold seems to be failing.
 This is in my score file:
  ("adjust-tags" (:threshold (t . 1000) :tags (t . (starred)) :comment "READ") (:threshold (nil . -100) :tags (t . (terrible) :comment "DON'T READ") )) 
 What this should do is:
  
tag posts with a score greater than or equal to 1000 as starred
 tag posts with a score less than or equal to -100 as terrible
  
What ends up happening is that:
  
all posts are tagged as starred
 posts with a score less than or equal to -100 are tagged as terrible as well as starred
  
The value of elfeed-score-serde-adjust-tags-rule (the only related variable I can find) is:
 (#s(elfeed-score-adjust-tags-rule :threshold (t . 1000) :tags (t starred) :comment nil) #s(elfeed-score-adjust-tags-rule :threshold (nil . -100) :tags (t terrible) :comment nil)) 
 This doesn't seem to change when I update the rule to e.g. make the starred threshold 2000. 
 Can't quite work out where this is going wrong. I thought I'd ask before I open an issue on GitHub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Emacs for 11 years. I'm not a programmer but an ordinary business-type who values Emacs mainly for Org. However, I have taught myself Elisp and have gone down the rabbit hole of customizing Emacs extensively. 
 It's my sense that the Emacs "ecosystem" is growing and innovating at a very healthy clip. The richness of ELPA, the frequency of new releases from the core developers, and the adoption of Emacs/Org in places like academia -- all these are examples.
 This appears to be happening in the world of professional coding too, despite very capable competitors like VS Code. Here's a recent quote from Jon Sander's blog, irreal.org: "The fact — as evidenced by Org-mode and Magit — is that Emacs is at the forefront of editor/IDE development." 
 Ponder that: "at the forefront." 
 I have no data on the actual number of Emacs users, or on the rate of production of new packages or counts of new lines of code, but it's my anecdotal sense that Emacs is modernizing and thriving. Not least, its reach is extending beyond the English-speaking world. 
 Is this the golden age of Emacs? Was it ever better than now?

 I'm getting two messages on startup and I can't figure out where they are coming from. 
 First, I use auto package update and it opens a buffer called package update results that just says every package I use fails to update. A snippet of the buffer:
 Error installing better-shell Error installing auto-package-update Error installing ansible Error installing all-the-icons-dired 
 It is triggered by these two lines in my settings file:
 (package-refresh-contents) (auto-package-update-now) 
 I can run package-reinstall successfully for the packages. Some time ago, I did try set it to straight.el and switched back, I think that's when I started seeing this. I triple checked there's no straight.el references.
 My second issue is I get this in the warning buffer:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install image: Package ‘image-’ is unavailable 
 I can't find anything for image- in my emacs directory:
 ~/.emacs.d master* 1m 15s ❯ ag use-package | grep image- ~/.emacs.d master* 
 Any ideas are greatly appreciated, thanks.

I am procrastinating writing an assignment that is due in a few hours, so I thought I'd create a little video on how I zettelkast.
Let me know if you want more like this. Me wresting in real-time, taking a new idea and seeing where I can connect it to established ideas to strengthen them, question them, advocate for or against them, and reconcile them. I have a few other tricks for finding connections, but I was running out of time and energy. I had fun doing this once I got into it, finding some reinforcing ideas.
Background
I tried to keep the content as application-agnostic as I could. The subject of the video is Effective Notetaking (2nd ed) by Fiona McPherson, 2014. One of the ideas she writes about is when highlighting is effective and when it is not. I show how this i…]]></summary>

 While I've have this working well enough to be usable, getting this working properly is quite involved given the number of key-maps there are which are layered on top of each other.
 Currently I'm clearly the key-maps and re-populating them to avoid accidentally using existing key-map entries, but there are quite a few keys to map.
 Has anyone managed a comprehensive remapping of evil-mode keys before? Any suggestions for an approach that works well?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to functional programming and wondering what design patterns I need to study to be able to create a progress bar.
 For instance, assume you're writing a Haskell console application to calculate the pixels of a fractal flame, that you call from a GTK+ or Flutter GUI desktop art app. If you want the GUI app to be able poll the Haskell app for progress and display the current iteration of the image on the screen, how would you do that?
 In imperative code I could make the image calculator run only 10 iterations of the main loop at a time, return the loop number, image contents, and time elapsed to the calling app. Then either continue or stop the calculation based on the calling app's response.
 But functional programming has no loops, no iteration counter, and no way to stop a function once it has begun, as far as I know with my beginner understanding.
 Is such a thing possible? What is it called in FP speak? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of us are familiar with tree-style thinking that org-mode seamlessly enables, where a parent node has an infinite amount of tree children. From a gardening perspective this works great if you're not breeding and instead just saving seed, as you can structure the data as follows, where each subheading is a genetic descendant of the parent:
 ​
 ** San Marzano Tomato
 :PROPERTIES:
 :WHATEVER: WHATEVER
 :END:
 *** Plant 1
 :ID: sjkjlfkjh
 :YIELD: Xlbs
 [inline image]
 notes
 *** Plant 2
 :ID: oijiohiuhi
 :YIELD: Ylbs
 [inline image]
 notes
 **** Plant 2, Gen 1
 etc
 ​
 So I use emacs and org-mode for everything (of course), and being able to snap pics and add properties on the fly would be AMAZING for organizing anything cultivation related with minimal friction/overhead. Where organization and documentation tends to be most important is in breeding, and I'm unsure how I'd represent say a San Marzano and Roma cross elegantly. Of course I could create a new tree for each cross, but I recall reading org having some functionality (probably using tags and unique ID's) to make this seamless or somehow superior, I believe it was presented as a sort of directed acyclic graph using tags. Using org-mode at all for this would be great since HTML exports would be a freebie.
 ​
 This isn't complicated, but I'm just wondering how you might organize something like this so I don't have an 'a-ha' moment later and decide to restructure everything (but who am I kidding.. that's half the fun). I'm sort of thinking a tree per cross may end up best, since it'll work most naturally with org-mode, and the top level node can include inline images of each parent in the cross, and properties like :ID-FATHER:, :ID-MOTHER: etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​At my day job I work on a 35 year old product with literally a few hundred million lines of codes. It is essentially a mono-repo. 
 There are thousands of directory trees with Makefiles. To be consistent with Emacs concepts, let's call these 'projects'. Luckily projects are rarely nested, and not in the areas I work on. There is no discipline requiring file names be unique across projects, nor even within projects. Furthermore, within any project there can be multiple unittest/ and/or pkgtest/ directories. Each such directory must contain a suite_registration.cpp. 
 Most often I work within a single project and want to navigate to files in the same project. Less frequently I need to find a file in a sibling project. Unfortunately, there are ~400 siblings, though I very rarely visit more than 10. 
 With recent attempts to work within Emacs' built-in tools, I wonder how I find files in this code base. Or if Emacs lacks adequate built-in tooling, what package(s) might​ help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I was wondering if any of you had any fast keybdinding for everyday actions that are very frequently used. 
 ​
 I am trying to find the keybindings that better fit my workflow but I'm really struggling with it: what I'm setting up is a very simple markdown editor and there are 4 things that i always do (bold text, italic text, math text, code text) but i just realized that the C-c prefix combinations are sooo slow for me. 
 ​
 What i usually did with traditional editors was something like C-b (bold) and C-i (italic) so i was insanely fast at it. I see that many keybindings besides the C-c prefix are already taken and it looks like overriding those is frowned upon. (Plus, C-i is basically <tab>). 
 ​
 So, back at the main question, is there some keybindings for some actions that you ***very*** often do use? How did you manage to set it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I'm trying really hard to make elec-pair work for me without any success. This is a minimal config (Emacs 26.3):
 (electric-pair-mode t) (setq electric-pair--skip-whitespace nil) (setq electric-pair-skip-self nil) ;;it's hard to indent in reddit (setq electric-pair-pairs '((?\( . ?\)) (?\[ . ?\]) (?{ . ?}) (?* . ?*) (?` . ?`) (?$ . ?$))) (setq electric-pair-text-pairs '((?\( . ?\)) (?\[ . ?\]) (?{ . ?}) (?* . ?*) (?` . ?`) (?$ . ?$))) 
 Basically the paired character are the brackets, the dollar sign, the backtick and the asterisk. The intended behaviour is that none of these should "skip". (Meaning that typing } near another } should result in }}). 
 The brackes do not skip, but the other chars do skip! For example, if the point is at $|$ and i type another $ what i get is $$|. The dollar sign gets skipped! 
 Also, something i notices is that the double quote char (") gets paired even if it is not in my config file. Why is that? How should I configure electric-pair?

 Are there any Windows users that have managed to find a solution for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, apologies for the title. 
 Don't really know how to name what I'm looking for so here's an attempt at describing what I'm trying to do.
  
I have a bunch of case classes with N amount of vals/ contractor params. Examples: Foo(a: String, b: String), Bar(c: BigDecimal, d: Set, e: Option). And so on..
 
I would like to have a "rule" or mechanism of some sort that would enforce compile time that for each companion object of these classes need to declare a corresponding val for each of it's companion class constructor parameters. 
 
Let's say I have a class ParamRules(rule1: String, rule2: String)
 
Naive idea in my head looks like that:
 
 case class Foo(a: String, b:String)
 object Foo extends MagicMechanism(Foo) ( val a_rules = ParamRules(...) val b_rules = ParamRules(...) )
 And with that compiler is satisfied.
 If the object Foo doesn't implement a "rule" for one of there constructor params it fails compilation.
  
It doesn't have to look like that it could be entirely different I just want to dynamically enforce this interface user to provide rule for each of the params in the class. 
  
Let me know if I'm day dreaming, over engineering or simply having a stroke and if you need any more explanation.
 Thanks!

 At some point I was tempted by shiny tools like OmniFocus (a fantastic tool, no doubt), Nisus Writer, Roam Research, and some more.
 After some time I realized I have isolated islands of tools not inter-operating, and I have little to no control over these tools, at least not in a consistent way (JavaScript in Roam, Apple Script and JS in OmniFocus, etc).
 So again I came back to Emacs + Org two weeks ago, having left it for several months. Now, as if my mind has been digesting all the infos that I have accumulated the months before I left it, I suddenly feel like all pieces fall together, I am quickly hacking Emacs Lisp for my workflow automations, my fingers are flying over the keyboard (using Karabiner Elements and "God Mode" https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6) and I get sooo much more done in a way not possible by the other tools I used! Everything is connected to each other now: My writing, documenting, my task management, my text editing and every bit of a text tranformation. This is such a wonderful way to get things done.
 Thank you to all the maintainers of Emacs, Orgmode, and all the wonderful packages like ivy, counsel, org-ql, and many more!
 Also, I am very happy with this community, that has helped me get a better understanding of the ins and outs of Emacs and Elisp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 On my old notebook I get this frequently (maybe a config issue), on my main machine (Emacs v26.3) I do have this behavior right now: After undoing a large deletion (during a bisect-task) GNU Emacs is consuming its one CPU core for 100%, not ending for an hour or so. I consider this an end-less loop.
 Emacs server is running as well.
 What are my options to debug what's going on? Can I somehow connect to the running instance and activate a profiler? Is there anything else besides killing the task what I can do?
 Thanks!
 Update 2022-04-25T16.21 CET: C-g did not do anything.

 I do have an issue with git recognizing four of my Org-mode files as binary.
 This has an impact on my workflow to detect unwanted changes which caused an issue in the recent days I did not recognize.
 In order to revert the unwanted changes, I do have to find my workflow for that. But first, I want to make sure that those Org-mode files are (again) treated as non-binary by git.
 Has anybody an idea on the things going on here that led to binary detection? How can I locate the characters that might lead to that wrong conclusion?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm writing a parser in Haskell. The first step is to tokenize, so I have a Token type and my tokenize function returns a list of Tokens. My parse function takes that list of Tokens and does the parsing using mainly pattern matching returning a parse tree and the tokens it could not parse.
  data Token = Lambda | Dot | LParen | RParen | Ident String deriving Show 
 So now, I realized the error messages I can generate are terrible because while I have the tokens where the problems begin, I have no idea where in the source file the tokens come from. The way I would solve this in an OO language is that I would add some fields to Token listing things like source file, column and line.
 So I tried something like:
  data Position = Pos String Int Int 
 and then
  data Token = Lambda Position | Dot Position | LParen Position | RParen Position | Ident String Position deriving Show 
 But this is just awful. Now, my parse function is broken because all my pattern matches are wrong. What's the "right" way to do this? Ideally, my parse function wouldn't have to change much, after all, none of this extra data matters to it.

 I've been working on a series of functions for org-mode that make it easier to work with task items with sub-headings. I've called it org-taskwise and even though it's still fairly lightweight, I'm getting a good amount of use out of it so far.
 Of course, these functions are not generally applicable to every org file I may write, though on the files that I want to use these functions, I want to overwrite some org-mode functionality with the functionality in this package. There is also functionality that does not need to overwrite org-mode functionality, but that complements it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using org-noter to read epubs in org-mode, which works fine until recently. When it is a pdf file, everything still works as before. However, when it comes to an epub file, org-noter will not work. I'm not sure why this happened but didn't want to bother to dig into this issue because it is not the first time this package breaks down on me. Consequently, I need to think of a different way to read epubs and take notes in org-mode. Since I already use calibre to manage my ebooks, my new workflow simply combines using calibre links and xdg-open.
 The native ebook viewer in calibre allows us to export links to specific locations in the book. The link looks like "calibre://view-book/someid/somefomat?open_at=somelocation". Using xdg-open with this link opens the specified book at the exact location. The default viewer enables highlights and other annotation methods, which is also a plus. So all I need to do is to add a new link parameter for "calibre" in org mode and define a follow method. Below is a snippet.
  
(org-link-set-parameters 
 "calibre" 
 :follow 'my/calibre-follow 
 ) 
 (defun my/calibre-follow (path) 
 (call-process "xdg-open" nil 0 nil (concat "calibre:" path)))
  
It is a very simple implementation but it does the job. If you have a similar workflow of reading ebooks and taking notes, maybe this can help. Feel free to add anything. I welcome any suggestions.

 const Wrapper = styled.div` width: 24px; height: 24px; margin-right: 14px; cursor: pointer; ` 
 ​
 export const schema = gql.gql` type Transaction implements Entity { createdAt: Date createdBy: User entityType: EntityType! fileIds: [ID!]! }` 
 ​
 Now I saw some people are using polymode and mmm, I was not able to make it to work properly, I could make it highlight the code but it was not possible to write anything inside the string itself.
 When I think about this, it's already happening with other languages like org-mode that can show syntax highlighting inside it's code blocks and even on js/ts files when you're doing the following:
 `this is a template string with a variable ${a == b ? 'this gets syntax highlighting' : 'so why styled cant??'}` 
 Any help would be much appreciated.

 For some reasons, I want to immigrate to European or North American countries and settle down. 
 I'd like to ask, what is the minimum requirements for a Scala Data engineer to pass interview for companies like FAANG?
 Should I start practicing Leetcode now? Is it possible that the algorithm questions in the interview would be easier for data engineers? How far do a data engineer have to brush up his/her Leetcode level to find a job overseas. 
 I'm asking these questions, because in my native country, Spark ETL engineers seldom write algorithm code in an interview while they are still able to have the same salary level with other kind of engineers such as backend engineers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Precisely, when I run on GUI mode the META key is what is supposed to be i.e it sits right between the left ALT and Left CTRL key and behaves perfectly fine.
 Now, when I run from TTY , that META key got changed to the ESCAPE key, which means instead of pressing the META key I have to press the ESCAPE key.
 Wondering ......https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MetaKeyProblems 
 But.....
 The question is :
 Can I have keys behaves similarly in both environments??

The argument symbol is not implicitly quoted; =add-to-list= is an ordinary function, like =set= and unlike =setq=. Quote the argument yourself if that is what you want.
  
However, the question remains, why push not quote List?

 I've just managed to setup LSP-Mode on emacs. I'm using Clangd and upon opening a C++ based program I've been working on and entering "lsp-find-references" I saw that it wasn't finding all references. I believe this is because LSP-Mode didn't find a project file when I opened the C++ file and I pointed it to the root folder of the project, but of course it didn't find a project file because I don't have one (why would I need something so useless when I've got a make file :) .) Anyway I tried adding a compile_commands.json file that I generated using this web sight: https://texttoolkit.com/compilation-database-generator and changing the lines with "/path/to/your/project/" to point to my project.
 However it doesn't seem to have worked.
 How can I get LSP-Mode to recognize all the files in my C++ project?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Recently my Emacs got automatically updated from 27.1 to 28.1 (thanks Snap!) and oh boy am I regretting this.
 First, I had to re-install use-package because none of the packages seemed to work. Then I had to update all of the packages. Then Emacs almost took my system down with CPU usage because it was apparently recompiling packages without letting me know in either the messages or warnings buffers. Together with a bunch of stuff in between made this a fun adventure.
 Anyway, I'm lucky that people over at the Emacs Matrix room were able to help out, otherwise I'd be very much dead in the water. Especially considering my newness to Emacs.
 However, as the title says, there's still one issue remaining that irks me to no end. Emacs has lost the ability to collapse/expand headers of org-mode files. It could be a conflict between evil-mode and org-mode, but how do I tackle this? I have no idea.
 When I did C-h k <Tab> under an org file heading, I got this description:
 TAB (translated from <tab>) runs the command evil-jump-forward (found in evil-motion-state-map), which is an interactive native compiled Lisp function in ‘evil-commands.el’. It is bound to TAB. (evil-jump-forward &optional COUNT) Go to newer position in jump list. To go the other way, press C-o. 
 I don't consider having a huge or complicated config, so I'm not sure why the breakage happened like it did. If you have suggestions for future-proofing my config so that above disasters don't happen (or at least the chance of them get minimized), then please do let me know. Here's my init.el
 Thanks in advance.
 Edit:
 Thanks to @yantar92:matrix.org I think I know the root cause: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1604 - Seems like Evil-mode is not yet fully adapted to work with Org-mode in Emacs v28. Workaround is noted in that issue though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context:
  
I just got an Apple M1 Pro machine and am at the start of the evaluation period
 Since I know I’ll be programming in Haskell, I’m trying to use the language as I normally would on another machine
 Today I’ve observed some unexpected behaviour that is frustrating and which I’ve never noticed before
 As a caveat, I also have another MacBook Pro (with just the M1 chip) for work usage; I have installed Haskell on it too, but have never encountered a similar issue
  
Problem:
  
Please refer to the screenshot for the example
 In said example, I want to take a multi-digit integer and make a list containing each of its digits
 I make a ‘mistake’ in applying digitToInt
 After the error, I make the necessary correction by hitting the up arrow key, then moving the cursor to the start of the line so I can add map
 I type 4 characters: m, a, p and space – if you look closely you will see that the characters are indeed appearing, but digitToInt $ show 56 is getting replicated, and everything ends up being concatenated together
 When I press return, though, GHCi runs the command and I get the expected result
 In the last line, I press the up arrow key twice, and what’s being shown are the two previous commands concatenated together
  
Questions:
  
How can I eliminate this behaviour?
 What else could I try to better understand its cause (so that I can fix it)?

 System and machine information:
  
macOS 12.3.1
 M1 Pro 14-inch
 Using the ABC Extended keyboard (although the same behaviour was observed when I selected just the US keyboard)
 Restarting the machine has not helped; I’ve not noticed similar issues when using the regular command line

 Since I know debian tends to be behind as far as versions go I tried to follow the documentation here and use the elpa packages available through apt.
 Starting with elpa-evil (since I am new to emacs and want the vim bindings) I looked in list-packages after installing it via apt.
 Rather than a built-in package evil was listed as an external package.
 I may simply have worded my search wrong, but I couldn't find a way to install since the install package command could not find evil, and list-package info said it was unsigned with no option to install.
 I wanted to know if I am misunderstanding something stupidly obvious since I am new, or if I should just attempt to use the git version and risk it not being compatible.

I was reading through Effective Notetaking by Dr. Fiona McPherson today and had one of those moments where a note fell out that immediately connected to some other notes from other places, which ultimately snowballed into me writing a blog post based on the idea.
I've not shared much in this community before because I felt like I haven't had too much to say - but I've done plenty of reading along with everyone. As this post was both related to things I've been thinking about recently and directly related to the subject of the forum, I thought I might share it - and see if I can get any feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been reading and searching, but am not sure how to do this. As with most things Emacs, there are tons of options.
 I would like to use the homerow keys hjkl (QWERTY) to navigate with my Dvorak layout keyboard, which would be htns. (My keyboard is programmed for Dvorak.). 
 I’m using Emacs from Scratch configuration, which uses evil mode. I see the two lines following, so perhaps I could just change them to “t” and “n”, but what about h and s?
 ;; Use visual line motions even outside of visual-line-mode buffers (evil-global-set-key 'motion "j" 'evil-next-visual-line) (evil-global-set-key 'motion "k" 'evil-previous-visual-line) 
 I assume everything would be different if I decide not to use evil mode? Maybe using something like and adaptation of: 
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-h") 'backward-kill-word) 
 Finally, replacing C-x (quite a reach on the Dvorak layout) with C-u (right under the left index finger) makes so much sense. Would this work? 
 ;; swap C-x and C-u (define-key key-translation-map [?\C-x] [?\C-u]) (define-key key-translation-map [?\C-u] [?\C-x]) 
 And does it work with daemon mode now? (Via launchd?) 
 macOS 12, Emacs 28.1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've run into this issue in a few recent elisp experiments. I want to use format strings with custom expandos to represent points of key-value data (that is, I want to print a formatted string from a object which has keys and values, like a bibtex entry).
 Normally I could do this with format-spec, and associate certain keys in the original object with certain expando letters. But often the data I am formatting either has many fields (more than 26, so a format-spec gets unwieldy), or has a few core fields common to all data points, but could have any arbitrary fields beyond those (so it is impossible to assign expandos to all field names). Biblatex entries for example have a reference key, 133 defined field names, and facility for users to define and use whichever fields they want! Even expandos for a-z, A-Z and 0-9 wouldn't cover all that.
 On the assumption that the field names are always unique within a single object, a good solution to this might be somthing like format "%(field-name-1) -- [%(field-name-2):%(field-name-3)]", so as to print something like foo -- [a:b]. The idea is that the expando names (field-name-1, field-name-2, etc.) are programmatically checked against the entry (or against a list generated programatically from the entry), so there is no need for an explicit list of expandos like format-spec uses. I think I have seen a few packages do things like this before, but can't remember exactly where.
 Is there a standard way to do this?
 TIA!

 A bit like you can use agenda and org mode personally but in a way that any tasks are available to all users, got a small team of dev's who all use emacs so be nice if we could integrate into our workflow if possible with out managing separate task lists?
 Or any other options with nice emacs integration both jira and trello never worked that well when we tried in the past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if it's feasible to move of libreoffice writer onto orgmode. Can the following be achieved, in a streamlined way (more or less):
  
modifying the font, color of header levels;
 having an always visible table of contents shown right;
 could there be something like "rendered view" if I only want to read the prettily displayed text and "working view" when I want to change or define meta things, i.e. :PROPERTIES, #+SEQ_TODO:, etc.
 applying different font color to some table columns and not having elisp logic shown below. Ideally such logic could be defined in emacs.el;
  
​
 Out of all these 2 and 3 are the most important, as my notes can be lengthy and I use ToC to quickly navigate. Having them as headers at the top isn't optimal as I'd always have to return to search again.As for #3, I'm having quite a few tables in my notes. At times, some columns are green, some are red. It's important as it helps differentiate.
 ​
 Can it be done? I'm looking for such orgmode examples, but can't quite find anything that fits the bill.

This, however, by default puts the tray icons into the echo area, of all places. Since all my other system information is in the mode line, I would much prefer them to go there.
 Does anyone know of a way to do this? The exwm documentation is very quiet on this front.
 Alternatively, is there another community where I could find exwm wizards to help me out?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit: I just had a look at the exwm source code, and it turns out the system tray is actually a window that just happens to be pinned to the lower right of the screen. That probably rules out any simple way of achieving this.

 Last time I used Scala I was lost and made very inefficient code, now I’m learning more about the fundamentals and such.
 My questions are:
 1.how do I know I’m using Scala as efficiently as possible? I am reading “programming in Scala” and some trending Apache spark books. Last time I wrote Scala like I would write Java and it was super slow. 
  
Is currying really used in team projects and should I dig deeper into it? 
 
Where can I learn more spark to tackle very advanced problems? I was thrown into the deep waters last time with spark and I was very overwhelmed because I didn’t know how to effectively use spark (still don’t) and all the tutorials were very basic and didn’t go into more advanced depth that I could use.
 
What are some quick ways to know when a problem can and can’t be tackled in parallel? Can any problem be tackled in functional programming?

 I’ve found a 7 year old “answer” that instead uses the directory names which is both unrobust and does not actually use the tag metadata.
 I also read a comment from several years ago in which the poster described setting the default browser view sorting method to albums. This suggested to me that I might be able to use 'info-albumartist (instead of 'info-album) from the EMMS manual but using the former resulted in Invalid function: "Can’t sort unknown mapping!".
 It surprises me that no one appears to have solved this by now! Have I missed something? Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question might sound provocative but it isn't my intention. I'm genuinely curious why emacs has the concepts of "major" and "minor" modes. 
 I'm no elisp guru but to me it seems that a minor mode can do everything a major mode can: they both have hooks, key bindings, custom variables, etc. The only real difference AFAIK is that major modes are mutually exclusive. And even the latter wouldn't be hard to implement for minor modes by adding something like a boolean variable is-mutually-exclusive or a parameter. Yet the separation increases code complexity by separating the two and adding little idiosyncrasies to each.
 Moreover, the distinction introduces undue cognitive overhead by having us think of a mode as being the "main" or "most important" one in any given context. Why is that? Why e.g. should I think of js-mode as being somehow more "major" than lsp-mode even though the latter is the main driver of my editing process? It feels like maybe major and minor modes were abstractions designed to guide the process of creating packages but nowadays I see that as doing more harm than good.
 So, why not treat them on an equal footing? Do away with major and minor, and just have modes. To me it would decrease code complexity and reduce the cognitive overhead. But I'm not the expert here so I'm really curious about what you think about all this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm slowly learning elisp, and, as part of some org file processing that I want to do, I need to replace the content part of org-mode links (which are of the form: [[path][content]]) in a buffer. After looking around for a function that does that I couldn't find it, so I thought a good training might be to try to write it from sratch. I came up with:
 (defun inwit/replace-org-link-description (link new-description) (setq content-start-point (org-element-property :contents-begin link)) (setq content-end-point (org-element-property :contents-end link)) (setq len-thing-to-remove (- content-end-point content-start-point)) (setq len-thing-to-add (length new-description)) (setq offset-delta (- len-thing-to-add len-thing-to-remove)) (delete-region content-start-point content-end-point) (goto-char (+ content-start-point offset-delta)) (insert new-description) ) 
 However, this doesn't quite work, especially if it is run sequentially over several links in a buffer, because the substitutions (both the deletions and the insertions) start missing the correct spots after the first replacement, which works fine. What is happening here? I know that delete-region leaves the point where it should, and I thought that also insert does place the point after the insertion. However, I don't see how sequential calls to this function in a map loop can miss the right spots after the first one. It's like the numbering of the positions in the buffer does not update with my substitutions.
 In other words, is there a way to update the buffer so the following calls to my function can refer to the actual positions of the already modified buffer? Or, am I missing the point and there is a much better way to approach this task?

 I want to use a library called RDF4H and I am wondering if there is a way to make this library portable and already preinstalled for my professor.
 On my PC I use cabal install --lib rdf4h to use this library and then import it as Data.RDF, but my professor will not be using any cabal commands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview
 This is a new issue for me that started about a week ago.
 I started having issues with some git commands in when using magit and vterm recently. Specifically, git couldn't read my global config file. However, if I ran git from a non-Emacs terminal everything worked properly.
 I did a little research and learned that Emacs sets the following two environment vars:
 shell GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 
 These settings make git ignore my global config. Hooray for a problem half solved! Now I need to figure out how to un-set these variables in an Magit-friendly way.
 What I've Tried
  
After unsetting these variable in a shell session in vterm I can use the git command again but magit is still broken. 
 I also tried unsetting those environment vars in the script that I run to launch Doom but that didn't work.
 Finally, I also read in the FAQ that I should try exec-path-from-shell, which I am already using. I tried executing the exec-path-from-shell-initialize function interactively but that did not seem to help.
  
Does anyone know how to configure magit to unset these variables?

 If you worked at an enterprise and the security team asked you "why cant you just use visual studio like everyone else?" how would you reply? 
 For instance, my response might be "emacs is a more efficient text editor for language XYZ that I've been using for a long time" and their response might be "Fred in accounting programs in XYZ and they use <text editor that doesn't scare them>....". 
 I'm purposely leaving out a few details, but basically any logical explanation I have they have a response for. 
 Curious what you think, and thanks in advance.

 BOOM!!! Let's get to the point!!!
 What's magic when programming Elisp code is that at any time:
  
we can extract a little part of the program,
 replace some symbols by custom values,
 send it to the minibuffer with M-x eval-expression (or pp-eval-expression), press RET and,
 automatically get back some value in the echo area (or in the dedicated buffer *Pp Eval Output*).
  
In almost no time, misconceptions about what a program does (or why a program fails) can be spot that way.

 I've been an emacs users for a few years now. I know basic elisp, which means I wrote my own config and I can read and modify elisp snippets. I never created a package though.
 As the title suggest I'd like to write my own major-mode for a programming language, but I don't know anything about this topic, and I don't know where to start either.
 ​
 Can you recommend any resources or guides on writing a language mode from 0? Additionally maybe some simple (few lines of code) but quality codebases for language modes and examples worth studying?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 After trying a few effect systems (starting with monad transformers), it seems that most people consider the ReaderT eff IO pattern the most pragmatic way to handle extensible effects. This includes UnliftIO, which is considered "the good way" to do MonadBaseControl stuff, and some libraries even require UnliftIO instead of MonadBaseControl for unlifting IO.
 However, it seems that UnliftIO has zero support for Either-based error handling and ReaderT eff IO just assumes that you are using exceptions. Particularly after writing quite some Rust, I think that Either/Result is just a superior way to do error handling (specially with syntactic support or some abstractions to convert and generate error types). Unchecked exceptions in my opinion are bad, and feel like I'm back in Python-land where your program can crash at any time from anywhere without any guidance from type signatures.
 Are we supposed to forget about Either and typing and just embrace exceptions, or is there any hope in this regard? Can UnliftIO support this in any way? (I consider wrapping-throwing-catching-unwrapping Lefts more of a workaround)

 What's your preferred way of installing Emacs on Ubuntu? The distro still ships with 27.1 and I can't seem to find an up-to-date PPA with the latest stable releases.
 There's the Emacs snapshot PPA but I'm not really interested in it. I much prefer stability.
 Any suggestions?

 Some time ago I wrote a script to provide tab-completion for CLI programs in haskell built upon optparse-applicative. Arguably, one of the most used such programs is stack, so here is a link to the gist of such script for stack: Gist
 Simply fill in the desired executable and a full path to that executable, save, and dot-source the script. (. _stack.ps1 for the gist above).
 Admittedly, there might be some corner cases where the completion does not have exactly same behavior in pwsh and in bash/fish/zsh due to architectural differences in completion engines; if you find them - let me know, we will find a workaround =)
 Tab-completion would work best in pwsh >= 6. PR to optparse-applicative to autogenerate this script exists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've made a small library with implementations of two truth maintenance systems (TMSs) available on Hackage and Github. They are translations of Forbus and de Kleer's justification-based and assumption-based (JTMS and ATMS) algorithms.
 TMS algorithms are classic AI approaches to reasoning about logical implication relationships. Code using a TMS defines nodes representing sentences or logical ideas, and how some nodes can be used to conclude other nodes. We can also identify "nogood" or contradictory sets of nodes. Some nodes are distinguished as assumptions, and the TMS lets us reason about how the belief or disbelief in each assumption impacts whether we should also believe or disbelieve other nodes.
  
In the JTMS, the believe/disbelieve setting for each assumption is set directly, and the JTMS maintains the believe/disbelieve status of each node based on the current assumption beliefs.
 In the ATMS, there is no setting of "current" beliefs. Instead, the ATMS tracks the minimal consistent sets of assumptions which justify belief in each node.
  
Please do not look for beautiful and pure functional algorithms here! At this point the implementations are direct translations of the original imperative Common Lisp implementations, implemented as a monad transformer, and using STT. A non-stateful re-implementation remains an interesting idea for the (non-short-term) future! I wrote this library to give myself a bit more insight into how these algorithms work on the inside, and some deeper practice with the state thread libraries than I'd had before, but I hope you find them interesting or useful.

 I got the 3 courses on scala by Daniel Ciocirlan
  
the essential scala course, 
 the advance scala course

I am still in the essential course, for months now due to not really having the patience of watching the courses ( which seems to be too dragged out for me).
 Previous to purchasing the course I had gone through the official docs and gone through the tour of the language which is like an overview.
 In your opinion wouldn't it be best to just get my hands dirty on a basic project after going through a quick start guide on Akka and checking the docs if I get stuck as opposed watching length time consuming videos?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a total Haskell beginner, and am definitely in way over my head, but here goes anyways. Basically, I want to transform a function from one that uses currying to one that consumes part of an array and adds its output to the arrays head. I have a set of functions that I can use for that:
 base :: a -> [a] -> [a] base = (:) one :: (a -> a) -> [a] -> [a] one f (x:xs) = base (f x) xs one _ x = x two :: (a -> a -> a) -> [a] -> [a] two f (x:xs) = one (f x) xs two _ x = x --etc. 
 However, one and two are basically identical, and also look very recursive. It feels like there should be some way to write one function that would work for all length functions, but I have no idea how that would work.
 Any help would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really like how default elisp tab completion works.
 if you set (setq tab-always-indent 'complete), pressing tab in elisp buffer first correctly indents, and then if indented it "tries to complete the thing at point" basically autocompletes, by calling completion-at-point. i have eglot and clang installed, and i expect the same behavior in c++ buffer, but pressing tab, only calls c-indent-line-or-region. doing M-x completion-at-point or C-M-i works, but its far less convenient that just using tab key. I'm aware that there are other packages that do implement compilation for you, but i try to use built in stuff as much as possible.

 I attempted to write alternatives to manage dependencies in Scala apps.
 Agenda there is:
  
Dead patterns. 
 DI frameworks.
 Cake pattern.
 
 Pure ideas. 
 Dependency rejection.
 Dependencies as function parameters.
 The notion of the context for a function.
 
 Tooling and approaches. Reader and friends. 
 Reader monad.
 Dependency as API detail.
 Making unique contexts is not simple.
 ZIO ZLayer.
 Monad transformers (ToFu).

(use-package org-download

However, when I save an image in my clipboard, I keep getting prompted to "Please install the xclip program." I have installed xclip through use-package and I tried to install it via package-install command, but it did not show xclip there. How can I resolve this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To find (via regexp) lines starting with one or more asterisks I'd come up with this pattern in Python:
 "^\*+ " 
 In Emacs I have to use double backslashes like so:
 "^\\*+ " 
 But it does not work in this line:
 (string-match "^\\*+ " "** This is a heading") 
 What am I missing?
 Update
 Apparently it worked because it returns "0", which is the index of the string beginning with the match.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using my emacs setup for almost 7 years now and I feel like its time to start fresh. Theres a lot of cruft in there and some of the packages dont even work currently anymore, because they are no longer actively developed, things like irony, rtags, and elpy. I can also remove a lot of packages from my setup because I no longer need them. I've used helm this whole time, but I think maybe its time to give ivy a try and also switch to lsp. 
 Anyone else just start fresh after using their setup for a long time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always just went looking, checking one by one, if a key combination is taken or not, and they usually seem to be, and I don't want to overwrite the basic ones, because multiple times I've found later that such and such function is extremely useful after I'd considered it unimportant and rebound its key. Or recently that M-q seems to be unused in the global scope but in paredit mode it actually has a function.
 So, is there a system that you use for finding these new homes for functions that need them?

 Is there a way to prevent org export to escape $ symbols when exporting to latex? For example in my simple orgfile I may write
 ​
 some fancy interesting things on function $f(x) = x$. 
 which will get exports to 
 some interesting things on function \(f(x) = x\) 
 which can be generated perfectly well to compile this to PDF, but is not so handy when giving somebody else this TeX file. I remember there was an option setting you could set, i.e. 
 #+options: tex:verbatim 
 but that does not produce what I want. If somebody could point me to the right the direction, I would be grateful :D!
