I'm using a current build of emacs 29.0.50 on X (with StumpWM/XMonad and picom), it has cairo, built with gtk3, regular alpha works... but no change when setting alpha-background.
 Can anyone confirm this works for them on X with picom? I've heard it working on Wayland with Sway, and of the emacs fork that had this code initially on X, but what about on the current version of emacs with X?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm new to Scala and I'm following Martin Odersky's course on Coursera Functional Programming Principles in Scala. I'm also using IntelliJ IDEA. I set up my environment following the course but it seems that my code is trying to compile Scala 2 rather than Scala 3.
 When I run the following code in IntelliJ: 
 val x = 10 if x < 0 then println("negative") else if x == 0 then println("zero") else println("positive") 
 I get this error:
 /Users/myname/Desktop/miscellaneous/courses/functional_programming_principles/scala-project/src/main/scala/example/example.worksheet.sc:3:4 '(' expected but identifier found. if x < 0 then 
 When I run scala --version in my terminal I get Welcome to Scala 3.2.0 (11.0.16.1, Java OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM) and my REPL also works in Scala 3. 
 I'm sure this is related but I'm not sure how to fix it:
  
In IDEA, under External Libraries, OpenJDK 18 and Scala SDK 2.13.10 are listed.
  
Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks
 EDIT: I fixed the issue by simply starting a new project and following the IDEA new project wizard. Helped me select the JDK and Scala version that I wanted. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guys, I'm migrating from Vim to Emacs and my init.el is still very basic. I've installed evil, evil-collection and which-key. Overall, things are working pretty well, but I'm having trouble when using *Buffer List* (you know, the buffer menu invoked with C-x C-b or :ls<cr>).
 When I use C-h k o, for example, it shows the proper mapping defined in evil-collection: o is mapped to tabulated-list-sort.
 However, if I use C-h m, it says o is "Select that buffer in another window". And when I invoke which-key-show-mode, is says o is mapped to Buffer-menu-other-window.
 Am I missing something here? Is there a package that "glues" all the help systems together?

 Consumption of social media typically necessitates few repeated actions - like, share, comment and follow. If these actions are assigned to convenient keyboard keys, the consumption becomes easier. Here's an attempt to unify this experience using GNU Emacs and tumblesocks.

 I have all of the above installed --- and working. With Golang, the functions autocomplete with the parenthesis and placeholders for the args, as expected. So the plumbing works.
 But, when working with Javascript (with ts-ls), the functions and methods autocomplete without parenthesis or placeholders. So, for exemple, "document.querySel" autcompletes to "document.querySelector" -- NOT "document.querySelector(selectors)" or something like that.
 Again: yasnippet is installed and working and the entire thing works in other languages. Does anyone know why it doesn't work with Javascript?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a novice emacs user. In an attempt to set the font in my init.el file, I came across two different functions: set-fontset-font and set-frame-font.
 set-frame-font sets the font of current frame correctly, whereas set-fontset-font doesn't do anything. To my understanding, invoking (set-fontset-font t ...) is basically modifying the default font set, making new frames to use the font I specified, so this behavior is surprising to me.
 I frequently fiddle with code that contains non-alphanumeric characters (Hangul, Hiragana/Katakana, Emoji...), and I use different fonts for each of them. It would be great if I can use set-fontset-font as that function has this feature built-in. Is there a way to make it a one-function-to-rule-them-all?
 P.S. I tried modifying default-frame-alist with (font . "fontset-default") but apparently that is not allowed? Now my init.el is broken!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Doom emacs, with Evil mode.
 I am learning using Org Mode and I wanted to cycle through single Headlines by using the Tab key but what I can only cycle through is the first level under the Headline I am pressing the Tab key upon.
 To clarify, I don't want to use the S-Tab to cycle through all Headlines, but I only want to cycle through one Headline and its sub-headlines.
 How can I cycle through all nested Headlines, one by one, with evil mode
 I am sorry if that's a pretty noob question. Thank you all for your help
 Edit: I've found in the manual a workaround (which is actually the official combo key for the action I was looking for) by using C-c C-k. That key combo will expand all subtrees of a headline, recursively. To close the main headline back, I'll use za.
 Sadly, default vim z operations in evil-org look not working. E.G. zO is supposed to perform the operation I was looking for, or zr doesn't open one subtree at a time.
 Edit 2: In the lang: org README file from Doom Emacs I see that this behavior was intentional and that can be reversed.
  
 TAB was changed to toggle only the visibility state of the current subtree, rather than cycle through it recursively. This can be reversed with:  #+begin_src emacs-lisp (after! evil-org (remove-hook 'org-tab-first-hook #'+org-cycle-only-current-subtree-h)) #+end_src

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past month I've been working on implementing my first OOP language with Haskell .. implementing the syntax and context analysis was very easy for me because I'm very aware of the fact that we build parsers using stateful monads using one of the already available libraries (like parsec for example)... so that went easy after defining the context-free grammars that is not left-recursive, and then implementing the parsec-functions to every non-terminating symbol in the grammars... so that went easy with no hiccups... 
 But after I dived into the context analysis that's where shit hit the fan.. it seemed that my programming model has either been very bad or I'm a bad software-engineer because functions started to become very ugly due to many parameters that are passed to the functions, and many other reasons that I don't how to start to explain, but in summary whatever makes haskell beautiful I managed to make it very ugly and complicated with my architecture design..
 So my question is: we already have stateful monads and parsers like parsec as an architectural model to implement the syntax analysis and context analysis. Are there also standardized models to implement the other steps in compilers like the context analysis? Is there literature that answers this question in regard to Haskell?
 Edit: while implementing the context analysis I became very aware of the fact that need zippers because I needed to be very aware ot the context of every variable and method which then I did and made the job much easier, so maybe that's part of the answer that I'm seeking?

 Does the visible "Echo Area" live in a buffer?

 I run Emacs on a Mac. I install it via homebrew. I install packages with straight-use-package. INFOPATH isn't defined in my environment.
 When I enter Info in the usual way (C-h i) what I see is not optimal.
  
There is no entry for Emacs Lisp, among others.
 There are things for which there is no actual Info help. Example: "Info-find-file: Info file ‘ada-mode’ does not exist; consider installing it"
 There are almost 350 lines in the top level of Info and it is full of things I don't care about, such as EUDC, 'Gawk work flow', and 22 separate entries for things in GNU Gettext Utilities.
  
Info-directory-list looks like this (where <$HOME> actually represents my correct home directory)

        <updated>2022-10-15T18:41:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "snapshot" binaries of Emacs 29 for Windows posted today should be somewhat less fragile while running without GCC/libgccjit (e.g. MSYS2 installed and on the Windows path).
 https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-29/?C=M;O=D
 Note: the snapshot is dated Oct 13, 2022, but I posted it today, Oct 15th; took me a few days. The last included commit was cbd04ad3d572850775f18bde868c71abcde733ed.
 Anyway, this build use a new "trampolines" target for make. This target pre-compiles (AOT) trampolines, infrastructure that allows natively compiled elisp to call redefined elisp primitives, which are then included with the installer, zip and no-deps.zip distributables. While redefining primitives is discouraged, it does happen, especially via advice APIs.
 Including these trampolines should enable installing and running (e.g.) packages that advise elisp primitives. Previously (in all 29 snapshots and GNU windows binary distributions of Emacs 28) that might have failed because Emacs unconditionally creates trampolines on the fly if they do not exist when needed. Precompiling the trampolines should prevent Emacs from triggering async native compilation even when native-comp-available-p was returning nil, to make them.
 TIA for bug reports & feedback!
 PS, in case others are building Emacs with native comp enabled and not distributing GCC/libgcc with, the new make target isn't on the Emacs 28 branch (yet). It should be fairly easy to patch it in or manually add something like this to your packaging process after success of make all, before make install (or make install-strip or whtv)
  (mapatoms (λ (f) (when (subr-primitive-p (symbol-function f)) (or (comp-trampoline-search f) (comp-trampoline-compile f))))) 
 This code comes from message #50 in bug #58318, and worked for me (however, the 29 snapshot binaries do use the new make target, now - they don't use the above snippet).
 Edit: un-mangled the code block

 When I use control +/- I can only zoom in up to the font size I set in ~/.doom.d/config.el (doom user here) then it just says "The font hasn't been resized" (not big of an explanation).
 I zoom out and on the right bottom corner it tells me how many "steps" I zoomed back ( (-1), (-2), etc.), and when I press C-+ even just one time it takes me back to "0" ie the default font size I set.
 This what I have in my config regarding fonts.
 ;; ----------- FONTS ----------- ;; main font stuff (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Comic Mono" :size 24) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Ubuntu" :size 24) doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Comic Mono" :size 24)) ;; make italics and bold show without the slash and asterisk (not working) (after! doom-themes (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t doom-themes-enable-italic t)) ;; italic comments and keywords (not working) (custom-set-faces! '(font-lock-comment-face :slant italic) '(font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic)) 
 I'm sorry if the question is high noobeness, I'm not very practical with this and I don't have any idea of how to move forward. I love editing org files in emacs though, so these headaches are worth it.
 Thank you all.

One of the greatest difficulties in understanding the Zettelkasten Method is to separate its specific characteristics from actual knowledge work. Or, how I like to phrase it: “Link knowledge, not notes.” Working with our Zettelkasten is the physical (or digital) manifestation of our thinking. It provides a framework that allows us to think through writing and to create an increasingly complex thinking machine that can help us think deeper than being on our own. The Zettelkasten Method provides a framework for our thinking, but does not prescribe what and how we think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a way to mention and keep track of people similar to how Notion supports it but with org-mode? Here is my wish-list:
  
Start typing @ and get an auto-complete helm box with all the people I have in the system. Selecting one would should the nickname I defined for them in this sytem
 Have a capture template (for example when creating a meeting) where I can select the people I have in the system (multi-select) and assign them to a "with" property under the meeting heading
 Click on a @-link and see all the headings under which this person is mentioned.
 Assign a TODO to someone and later see all the TODOs by them (today I do this with tags but it doesn't work well with people with the same first names unless my tags keep a @first_lastname pattern for everyone) Closest I have seen so far is this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/64502 but it's part of a much more complex package which seems overkill. Plus, I don't see how I could easily use with a capture template.
  
Any ideas? Thanks!

 This is my stack and runner (precisely how I make the composition work remains a WIP):
 ```haskell newtype AppObs a = AppObs { iniApp :: ReaderT Env (ResourceT (LoggingT Handler)) a } deriving ( Functor , Applicative , Monad , MonadReader Env , MonadIO , MonadLogger , MonadThrow , MonadCatch -- , MonadError Text Already defined by Server )

 Any guidance or comments would be welcome.

 If core domain object is near service and repository then that module must include the dependency to the SQL or other database library. Now if your other project doesn't use SQL but they need your core object it will drag all the libraries with it.
 If you separate out the core domain class into a submodule that doesn't contain any dependencies, then you can import that to other projects, but then it's suddenly not package-by-feature. Or can we achieve a hybrid model where the core object is separate and then all the rest, SQL, HTTP, API, JSON are in one other module that is the app.

 type mismatch; found : cmd.Persist (which expands to) XXXXEntity#Persist required: XXXXEntity.this.Persist .onCommand[XXXXCommand, XXXXCreatedReply] { case (cmd: XXXXCommand, ctx, state) => cmd.apply(ctx, state) } 
 ​
 I created A Command interface and created Commands from it.
 trait XXXXCommands[R] extends ReplyType[R] { override type ReplyType = Rtype Context = XXXXEntity#CommandContext[ReplyType]type State =XXXXStatetype Persist = XXXXEntity#Persist def apply(ctx: Context, stateOpt: Option[State]): Persist = {stateOpt match {case None => initial(ctx)case Some(state) if state.XXXXStatus == XXXXStatus.Success => success(ctx, state)}} protected def rejectByStatus(ctx: Context, state: State): XXXXEntity#Persist = {ctx.invalidCommand(s"${this.getClass.getSimpleName}: Invalid operation. {Id: ${state.XXXXId}, Status: ${state.XXXXStatus}")ctx.done} protected def reject(message: String, ctx: Context): XXXXEntity#Persist = {ctx.invalidCommand(message)ctx.done} protected def initial(ctx: Context): XXXXEntity#Persistprotected def success(ctx: Context, state: State): XXXXEntity#Persist} 
 I am using (or trying to use) Lagom framework. Persist is a trait that is inside of the PersistentEntity trait. Because of the the inner traits I tried to take the Persist inside the Entity that I created via hash (#) operation. That may be the problem.
 I dont know how could I fix it but its so weird to have that problem. This would exactly work in java but why it did not in scala?
 Edit:
 It happens when I try to run the code below.
 override def behavior: Behavior = Actions().onCommand[XXXXCommand, XXXXCreatedReply] { case (cmd: XXXXCommand, ctx, state) => cmd.apply(ctx, state) }

In the coming weeks I'm considering releasing my hyper-minimal take on Zettelkasten to a wider audience. My rationale has always been to squash complexity in favor of a quick & lightweight method of retrieving notes (nothing at all wrong with other apps that have all the bells & whistles btw). The same codebase runs on any of Windows, Linux, BSD (Apple likely to be included soon as well) with zero issues.
Some screen shots...



The interface as you noticed is commandline driven & features a REPL (Read Evaluate Print & Loop) to process commands. As it stands now, the source code is merely 27 Kilobytes in size & would be great to toss on a USB drive so your notes are easy to access. No smartphone interface as I'm not much interested in that domain. At any rate, if this sounds like something you might be interested in, check in every now & again & I'll hopefully post a download link eventually.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I want to write a simple converter from lambda calculus expressions to SKI expressions using these 6 rules. I have my two types
 data Expr = Var String | Abs String Expr | App Expr Expr data SKI = S | K | I | App SKI SKI 
 With these types, rule 5 does not quite work using general recursion:
 general :: Expr -> SKI general (Abs v1 (Abs v2 e)) | free v1 e = general (Abs v1 $ general (Abs v2 e)) 
 Understandably, this doesn't work because Abs requires its second arg to be an Expr but general returns SKI.
 I've tried implementing it using various recursion schemes (futu, histo, para and ana), but to no success. Is there a way to do this without having to merge the two types together into one?
 And additionally, if something can't be implemented using general recursion, can it be implemented using recursion schemes? Or is general recursion strictly "more powerful"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found that completing-read + embark-act-all rocks. For example, I can update all lsp-related package in straight.el by calling straight-pull-package and then type lsp- to get a list of completion candidates with lsp in the name. Then I call embark-act-all and pull all the selected packages.
 But it would be useful to be able to switch from an arbitrary completing-read minibuffer into completing-read-multiple via a key-press, collect multiple candidates (which don't necessarily have matching substrings), and then just run the original command for each of the selected candidates, e.g. via embark-act-all. This would be much more convenient than just running the command multiple times or what I sometimes do, mapping the function over the list in elisp (M-: (seq-map #'<command> candidates))
 I could write my own function which calls completing-read-multiple, like straight-pull-package-crm, but it would be nice if something like that would be possible from any command. I'm asking because I thought something like that should already exist somewhere or be possible somehow with existing functionality in emacs/embark.
 Feel free to propose other solutions to my problem, as what I'm asking might be an XY problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I just attended a job‍ that was largely JVM-focused. I'm not new to the JVM; I've done previous work in Java (1.6/Android) and spent a large chunk of time writing Clojure. My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I'll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I'd feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I've also been there and done that, and I like types now. Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We're a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. I'm looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general. I'm not opposed to pragmatism either; it's one thing I like about Scala. It seems like there's a lot of excellent libraries because of the existing JVM ecosystem. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To me, I've always thought that data constructors should have a lowercase first letter, because they are term-level and behave very similarly to functions. For example,
 data T = D Int f :: Int -> T f = D 
 Here, f and D are very similar conceptually, so why should they be represented differently?
 I've read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6237775/why-does-haskell-force-data-constructors-first-letter-to-be-upper-case but the only compelling argument to me seems to be pattern matching, since data constructors can be matched on but functions cannot. However as someone who learnt haskell recently it seems to me that it would be clearer if data constructors had a lower case first letter to make clear their term-levelness.

 I’m very efficient in Scala 2, good old runtime-programming and FP, but macro always felt like something not to touch in Scala 2.
 Now there’s Scala 3, and metaprogramming seems to go mainstream. The problem though is that I cannot get used to programming at compile-time. Everything I have in my project is someone else’s copypasta. I’ve read the docs and few blogposts, but still not capable to write it myself. 
 I’m looking for small Scala 3 exclusive (mixing it with 2 makes much harder to distinguish) projects with use of metaprogramming where I can learn more and perhaps contribute. Ducktape (https://github.com/arainko/ducktape) is a great example. Any blog posts would be even better.

Writing generators for property-based tests is an art, and there’s often a
trade-off between how many test cases are generated and how meaningful each of
them is. When considering stateful systems, this problem is exacerbated, because
any action taken now may constrain the available actions for the future. This

Vuiet is supposed to show playing track information on the modeline - right about where you’d normally have line/char line counts. Mine very rarely does this; I haven’t exactly pinned it down, but SOME buffers will actually show this information. It doesn’t seem to be vuiet-specific ones exactly, but I think that might be it. 
 I’d really appreciate any suggestions for where I could look to pull that info out of vuiet and add it to my modeline. 
 I tried placing (vuiet-update-mode-line) in the modeline config variable (forget the exact name) but that didn’t help. 
 Sometimes when I run the command manually I can actually see it for what looks like a frame or two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So let's say I have a library and a test-suite and my Cabal file looks something like this: 
 ```cabal library exposed-modules: MyLib build-depends: base >=4.14.3.0 hs-source-dirs: src default-language: Haskell2010
 test-suite test type: exitcode-stdio-1.0 main-is: Test.hs build-depends: base >=4.14.3.0 , my-lib hs-source-dirs: test default-language: Haskell2010 ```
 I want to test a "private" function from MyLib. The function is not supposed to be exported by the module. But of course then I can't import the function from my test suite. What's the standard way to deal with this? 
  
Put the tests together with MyLib and export the tests? 
 Make a dedicated module just to re-export the "public" functions and for all other modules just export everything? 
 Never test private functions?
  
All of these options seem flawed to me.

 I've been using xwidget-webkit in Emacs for a while now, thanks to d12frosted's great Emacs Plus Homebrew formulae which include it as a build option. If you don't know, this feature allows you to run an instance of a browser from within an Emacs buffer (if you run MacOS, the browser is Safari, though this might be configurable -- I'm not sure). I find it a great and useful feature when browsing code-documentation online or using search engines for quick questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: I need to specify a :files value inside the use-package form, but this has irritating side-effects.
 I install packages with straight and use-package.
 I use the transient package. I noticed that its info manual didn't appear for me with C-h i. I dug deeper and realized that .../straight/build/transient didn't contain a dir file or any of the doc files. Several other packages, like orderless, did include dir in their straight/build directories, but their repo directories also happen to store the doc files at the top level.
 transient is different in that its repo has a docs/ subdirectory, which seemed to be the source of the problem. But magit has a similar repo structure, and its docs were installing fine.
 I noticed that the recipe for magit has a :files key which pulls in the doc file. Adding
 :straight (:files (:defaults "docs/*")) 
 to my (use-package 'transient ...) form appears to do the trick - and automagically triggers a make docs command for transient somehow - but now I have two wrinkles:
  
straight rebuilds transient every time I start Emacs
 I get a warning "Warning (straight): Two different recipes given for "transient" (:files cannot be both nil and (:defaults "docs/*"))"
  
The first issue is annoying, but isn't a showstopper. I don't restart Emacs very often and my startup time is already slow.
 The second issue worries me, because I don't know whether it means that updated docs will actually get installed in the future. Presumably the clash is between my (use-package 'transient ...) and the recipe that gets used when transient is handled as a dependency of magit (which I also use). But which recipe is actually used to install transient now? Is it getting installed twice every time?
 I don't know why the transient docs aren't getting installed "out of the box" as they apparently are for everyone else. What might I be doing wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I’m pretty new to scala and the usage of underscore to simplify lambdas seems a little obscure to me. For example I can write this:
  readLine.split(" ").map(_.toInt)  And it works as expected, but then I try:  vertices(v).filter(!(visited(_))  and the compiler would complain:
  
value unary_! is not a member of Int => Boolean
  
So I end up writing my lambda expressions with _ and if I see an error then I expand them to “true” lambdas like:  vertices(v).filter(vertex => !(visited(vertex)) 
 This is a little frustrating, so what I want to know, is, what are the rules that the underscore syntax OK in the first case, but wrong in the second one?

 This the another mode or command that can detect and print out the home and end keys?

Haskell Server Pages With Okapi by Rashad Gover
I wanted to see if Haskell Server Pages (HSPs) could be implemented with Okapi. What would they look like, how would they function, and how would they compare to server pages in other languages?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write FFI bindings for librrd. My code can be found here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/tree/context-bindings
 This is the first time I use FFI and I have not come very far. I can query the version of the library and do some calls to rrd_*_error which run but return empty results. So I'm not even sure I am missing something very basic here.
 This is what I observe: The tests in general run fine, until I enable the one defined here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/blob/context-bindings/test/RRDTool/LowLevelSpec.hs#L41 which calls rrd_get_context. The tests simply crash then:
 $ cabal test --test-show-details=always Running 1 test suites... Test suite hs-rrd-test: RUNNING... Test suite hs-rrd-test: FAIL 
 Started in a repl I get the following:
 ghci> :add *RRDTool.LowLevel Ok, two modules loaded. ghci> rrd_get_context cabal: repl failed for hs-rrd-0.1.0.0. The build process segfaulted (i.e. SIGSEGV). 
 The code of rrd_get_context can be found here: https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_thread_safe.c#L43 It basically does some calls to pthread.
 Can someone help on what to do next?
 EDIT: I looked into this a bit deeper. The problem actually does not seem to be the calls to pthread, but the way I read the rrd_context_t in Haskell (i.e. the peek). I changed my test to simply call the raw functions in C and look at the returned pointer address. That works ok and I do not get a null pointer. So I guess it has to be the peek which triggers the segmentation fault.
 This also happens when I simply call rrd_new_context which according to the C code ( https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_error.c#L121) only does a malloc and then returns the pointer.
 So either the memory pointed to is already taken away from my process (not sure what the proper wording is here) or my Storable instance is broken.

I've been trying to configure my init.el for org and org-roam, and I've gotten to where emacs starts without any error, I can open org-mode and I can open org-roam-mode. Then I'm stuck. Well, I did find that in org I can hit C-x C-f and open a *.org file and enter outline stuff, and save it, but I'm baffled by org-roam. Let's say I found some interesting ideas in the comment section of a blog in my browser. I assume that to record the note (zettel) I need to start emacs and get into org-roam-mode. What do I do then? I mean, what keys to I press to open a new note? How do I specify the type of note (main or reference, I'm starting out small)? Is there a tutorial anywhere that gives this kind of instruction for org-roam or zettelkasten?

 I'm currently moving my time tracking to org-mode after already using it for a few years.
 So far I've managed ok to transition/integrate org-mode in my caldav workflow.
 I found few problems that I have questions on:
  
I've used timestamps such as the one below in some entries however they don't seem to appear in my agenda buffer: <%%(and (diary-cyclic 14 31 3 2022) (diary-block 31 3 2022 30 3 2022)) 07:00-08:30> Is there anything that I need to do so that entries using those appear in my agenda?
 I've then tried to use something like `<2022-03-31 Do 07:00-08:00 UTC +2w> that works however if I include -1d to get a notification a day before they agenda doesn't show it for some reason.
 How does org-mode deal with timezones? I get some calendar invites that contain different timezones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider the following megaparsec parsers:  ab = string "a" >> string "b" ac = string "ac"  I want to parse them consequently, maybe adding some modifier two the first one (??? ab >> ac) to achieve the following behavior:
  
ab should be optional
 if both parsers fail, expectations of both parsers should be shown (or, at least the first one)
  
I've tried the following:
  
optional ab >> ac
 try (optional ab) >> ac
 optional (try ab) >> ac
  
The first, as expected, is not able to parse "ac", the second behaves identically to the first. The third is much better, but it doesn't satisfy the second condition: for input "az" it returns "expecting 'ac'", but not "expecting 'ab' or 'ac'". It's interesting, that if the first symbol doesn't match (for example, for "z"), the desired behavior is achieved. However, this is not enough in my case. How can I do this?
 This is my test code: ``` parsers :: [Parser String] parsers = [ optional ab >> ac , try (optional ab) >> ac , optional (try ab) >> ac ] where ab = string "a" >> string "b" ac = string "ac"
 strs :: [String] strs = ["abac", "ac", "z", "az"]
 test :: IO () test = for_ (parsers zip [1 ..]) $ (p, i) -> do putStrLn $ "parser " <> show i <> ":" for_ strs $ \str -> do putStrLn $ "string "<> show str <> ":" parseTest p str ```
 P.S. I've tried to write my one combinator for this issue, using observing or setState/getState, but have not achieved anything.

 Those counters would be live and would change depending on presses of C-s and C-r.
 I'd prefer counters instead of using avy and playing game of pressing assigned letter. You can very quickly press C-s or C-r given number of times without making a mistake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to be able to actively recall my notes and review them on a regular basis, and I haven’t figured out how to implement them in my notes.
 I read Doubleloop’s blog post on his workflow, but as he stated in the improvement section,
  
I feel like I’m maintaining the flashcards separately from the body of my notes – it’s a bit of a duplication of effort. It’d be good to get a flow where the flashcard is just part of the note as is, and I can pull it out without duplicating it.
  
I tried to manipulate it a bit, and my current workflow is incorporating it directly into my notes.
 Take this note, for example, about Edge Devices,
 * Definition :PROPERTIES: :ANKI_DECK: Computer Networking :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic :ANKI_NOTE_ID: 1665541877624 :END: ** Front What are Edge Devices? ** Back - They are known as End-sytems or Hosts. These devices are divided into two groups: Clients and Servers. - These are the devices that recieves the internet as a service. *And, then here I continue with some more examples on the topic.* 
 And then I export it to Anki for reviewing.
 My question here is this a good workflow in the long run, as all my notes would take this shape?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So I use both ef-themes and modus-themes by Prots as my themes, and I really like the fact that we can customize the org-mode headings by level.
 This is done with this configuration (from ef-themes manual)
 (setq ef-themes-headings ; read the manual's entry or the doc string '((0 . (variable-pitch light 1.9)) (1 . (variable-pitch light 1.8)) (2 . (variable-pitch regular 1.7)) (3 . (variable-pitch regular 1.6)) (4 . (variable-pitch regular 1.5)) (5 . (variable-pitch 1.4)) ; absence of weight means `bold' (6 . (variable-pitch 1.3)) (7 . (variable-pitch 1.2)) (t . (variable-pitch 1.1)))) 
 As far as I understand, we can only configure 8 level, I thought that the last line would set the themes for every subsequent level, but this is not the case in my experience. When I create a ninth level heading, it goes back to the style of the first level.
 This make it weird and not really attractive with file with many levels of subheadings.
 ​
 I don't know if we can overcome this limitation, if so I would be interested in knowing how.
 My second thought was to disable the theming in a specific buffer. But I wasn't able to do it by making the variable local. Is there a way to do that ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Usually, one doesn't encounter new simple monads in the wild, they're nearly all combinations of existing transformers. But I don't know of an existing transformer capturing this:
 data RandomT m a = RandomT { getRandomT :: RandomSeed -> m a } split :: RandomSeed -> (RandomSeed, RandomSeed) instance Monad m => Monad (RandomT m) where RandomT action >>= f = RandomT $ \seed -> do let (seed', seed'') = split seed a <- action seed' getRandomT (f a) seed'' 
 On first glance, you'd say "wait, that's just a reader", but in fact it isn't because of the split function. This could be generalized with this type class:
 class CoSemigroup a where split :: a -> (a, a) 
 While there are no nontrivial comonoids in Haskell, could there be nontrivial semigroups (although I'm not sure whether random seeds are an example because of coassociativity)? If not, do random monads implemented this way actually obey the associativity laws?
 Is this transformer implemented in general somewhere?

 I download packages manually and use use-package without :ensure to configure them. I managed to configure a very basic system with ivy, swiper, evil (+collection). The main goal is convenient org-mode use.
 Do you have any tips for such an offline situation? I admit its quite a chore to do all the config and package installation manually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! This post isn’t just about vuiet but this is my main issue right now. Using spacemacs on pop! OS I recently decided to start adding some extended features and working on my config. Eventually I managed to get lastfm.el and Vuiet working together and it’s awesome! I think I’ve figured out how to make a script with new keybinds for the Vuiet stuff I need to use, but some features are broken, namely searching songs by lyrics. I’m not sure how to debug emacs scripts so if anyone has any suggestions, including a better player, I’m open. Also, I’m shopping around for a completion module, mostly for Python but also C and HTML.
 Edit:
 Vuiet is cool, but seems like a lost cause. I think the only functionality EMMS doesn’t have that Vuiet did, though, is searching by artist for stuff I don’t actually have. 
 My main problem at this point is how to add an SMB share to EMMS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a bad dynamic in America's STEM education where kids going into college computer science out of high school hit a brick wall . . . largely made of math they've never seen before. In general, CS is not at all what they thought it would be. Then they switch/flunk out. So if higher-ed physics, engineering, math has a long, gentle preparatory on-ramp in K-12 with math, comp-sci has absolutely nothing -- or maybe just some "learn to code." And so I've been trying to put together a high-school-level on-ramp for real CS . And I'm basing it on Haskell. Why Haskell? Because the top-tier schools all do some sort of typed functional programming eventually. Functional seems to be the fault line between the top schools and the 2nd-tier. So for example I mix in discrete math with Haskell. You could say I'm high-school-izing the Doets, van Eijck text The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths, and Programming. Or even the Paulson ML for the Working Programmer, another fantastic book. Great, you might say. Trouble is I'm all alone -- as far as I know. For example, if you look at the AP Computer Science stuff, it's basically learn to program Java with a smattering of data structures and algorithms tacked on. Not really much help for a kid walking into Cornell or CMU. Every high school effort I've come across so far has hardly ever been more than "learn to code," typically Python. So my question to you is, should I keep going -- or give it up for a bad job? Am I really on to something, or am I tilting at windmills? The fact that I'm so alone on this is ominous. I've contacted lots of big name professors -- and they're sympathetic but in the long run apathetic simply because they're awash in 96th-percentile applicants. Yeah.... Your ideas would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I binded a function open-file-at-cursor. This allows me to open the file directly from a file (given I've written down the correct path). Now, I want to use something like this where I can give the file paths as environment variable. I've been struggling but couldn't find anything related to this. Please help!
 Edit: Noting down the use case for this
 Let's assume we have a file in path - /home/user/dir1/dir2/file.txt
 I've set some env variable $TEST=/home/user/dir1
 In some other file (let's name it file2.f under dir2), I've mentioned following two lines:
 ../file.txt
 $TEST/dir2/file.txt
 With the "open-file-at-cursor" bind, I'm able to directly open a file.txt when my cursor is on 1st line. However, the same bind breaks down for line 2. I'm expecting both lines to open the same file. ffap does not solve my issue as it opens the final directory that holds my file(this will increase my keystrokes).
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody! Haskell caught my attention because of its powerful type system. I come from a math background so I thought it'd be fun to implement some theorems in abstract algebra in Haskell. From what I understand, there are classes of functions in Haskell like <> for example which represents an associative operation. What I'd really like is to implement a homomorphism type that sends f (x * y) to f(x) * f(y). The trouble I am having is that in mathematics we will always demand a proof that a map is a homomorphism before we give it its status as one. Is this not the case in Haskell? In other words, do we need to manually check that an operation is a homomorphism or is there some way for Haskell to recognize one (perhaps with a bit of assistance from the programmer/type system/something else)?

This can become a problem in any codebase, but there is a trick for NixOS configurations that makes the process a whole lot less stressful.

Input Hashes
A NixOS system is defined by a configuration written in the Nix language.
The configuration sets various options and is evaluated into a build task for the system, which incorporates instructions for how to build, along with all the inputs they depend on.
Building the system involves fetching the inputs and executing the instructions, which genera…]]></summary>

 I want to create a database that keeps track of all people that have access to some data. The database is shared by a couple of organizations, sub groups of that organization and specific characters/addresses/people/user within that organization on one table.
 Traditionally I would just use a hashmap of some nature.. the hashmap could look up the user and we would know what organization they are apart of and we could easily remove that person from the organization access table.
 But if we have an organization of 10million addresses/users that seems like a bad idea.

 I ask because my keyboard kind of sucks and eats inputs sometimes, so the workflow gets jenk a bit. I would rather have some kind of checklist or small buffer that goes through each prompt than getting prompted by the mini buffer each time.
 Please let me know if this could be fixed by a package instead as well, thanks!

To open the PDF output file you can now also use PDF Tools, a document viewer for Emacs. With it, as a plus, forward and backward search is accurate at word level.
  
I'm only able to achieve word-level accuracy on reverse sync search. On forward sync search, the arrow that appears in the left-hand margin of the PDF preview buffer can be off by as much as a half-dozen lines.
 Is there a way to configure AucTeX + PDF Tools in order to highlight the word in the PDF Tools preview buffer corresponding to where the cursor is positioned in the AucTeX latex source buffer during a forward search instead of placing an arrow in the left-hand margin, which by construction can only be line-level accurate at best?

 I know about occur-rename-buffer but that gives only the buffer name not the regexp. When I run ibuffer I see this: *Occur: init.el* and *Occur: init.el*<2>. That's not very practical. Something like: *Occur: init.el*<defun> and *Occur: init.el*<global-set-key> would be much better.
 I've found this: rename-occur-buffer-term which it does display the regexp but not the buffer-name :/ I tried to put both together but my e-lisp knowledge is very, very limited atm. 
 Is anybody here already have a fix for this?

The pool is instantiated lazily with no open connections
 Connections are acquired when requested
 Each connection is exposed as an fs2.Stream[IO, R] where R is the type of the connection
 Each connection is checked for error before release–if error, then dispose of the connection instead of releasing it back into the pool
 The connection pool as a whole is instantiated as a Resource[IO, ConnectionPool[R]] and all open connections are released when the pool is released
  
I would appreciate if anyone could take a look at my code and offer any thoughts/feedback/critiques.

 My question really isn't different from this question that was asked six years ago:
 Speedbar in GUD - gdb debugger and watch expressions

 So... what da heck? I hate to do this improperly but do I need to manually download evil-escape from github (first link) and stick it in the .emacs.d folder myself? Or is Melpa broken? Or spacemacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title says most of it. I use a lot of latex equations that I label with #+NAME and reference with internal org links, as these work both in org-mode and turn into into latex references on export. The only thing missing is a quick way to be able to pick from previous equations to reference, like how reftex does it for normal .tex editing. Is there perhaps some existing library that solves this problem?

 I'd much rather have a repl running within emacs - and just be able to "eval line" or "eval region" as I'm going. 
 I have to assume someone in this amazing community has already figured this out - anyone know of any existing libraries/tutorials to hook this up?

 Ever wanted to write a function or command, but don't know what the functions for say manipulating buffers or getting file names are called?
 Version 28 of emacs introduced a new feature called shortdoc. It gives an overview over available elisp functions in a few select categories. Use the command M-x shortdoc-display-group and then type in which category you want to view and a buffer pops up giving you a brief overview.
 Give it a shot. Its great!

 I'm now getting to reading (and taking notes on) a number of publications in epub / pdf format mostly.
 I'd love to hear how everyone is dealing with references in books. My own (planned at this point) system would be to highlight passages in texts and paraphrase them in org-roam nodes.
 M-x highlight seems like the key here - is those highlights something I can reference from org-roam?
 bddean's ereader and nov.el look appealing, especially with nov-xwidget.el for formatting on the latter.
 Should I spend time exploring both of these, or am I missing the point?

I raised a ticket through Red Hat's security response channels at the time: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004547. For some reason got closed but u/juhp revived it and it finally got its CVE assignment: CVE-2022-3433.
 If you needed a canonical CVE reference for the library issue now you have one.

 Everywhere I edit text, I'd use the Vim keymap, it is already an extension of my mind in some way and I feel crampled when working without it.
 Lately, I've started building my Emacs config from scratch, to abstract myself from the computer I'm using and start gravitating towards using Emacs more as an OS rather than a code editor.
 I've been avoiding to use evil-mode and friends for two reasons:
  
I'd need to configure all the unimaginable keybindings to work properly with other packages (I'm aware of evil-collection though)
 I feel like the Emacs keybindings are designed like that in some way and that the part of the community that doesn't use evil works in the same level of efficiency or better due to tighter integration between packages.
  
My question would be: 
 Is it worth the effort I'm taking to learn the Emacs keybindings, or is it just "a different way of doing the same things"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy. It would be much easier for me to do my note-taking if org-roam-node-find had the following behavior: - Pressing TAB changes the text in the search bar to whatever the suggestion list has highlighted. I'd like it to just replace the entire thing instead of doing that default step-by-step completion if possible. - Pressing ENTER opens or creates the exact match of what's entered in the org-roam-node-find search bar. 
 Currently, I'm having some issues. My PKM note hierarchy uses dots as delimiters. Take the note res.lore.sw as an example (my note about Star Wars). I created it first. Now I want to create res.lore as an index for all the lores I've written about, but org-roam-node-find won't let me create it, because it matches with the Star Wars note and opens it. I'd instead like to be able to either press TAB to set the highlighted file as the new search, or press ENTER to open or create the exact note id entered into the search bar.
 My current org-roam config is pretty much the minimum:  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory "REDACTED") (org-roam-complete-everywhere t) (org-roam-capture-templates '(("d" "default" plain "%?" :if-new (file+head "${title}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n#+date: %U\n") :unnarrowed t))) :config (org-roam-setup) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to use eglot with the R language server. However, eglot does not seem to work well with either RMarkdown or Quarto documents as it hangs every time entering when enter a code chunk (up to 5 seconds or so). I am guessing it does this because it disconnects when entering the markdown mode and then needs to reconnect again. I am not sure. 
 I have two questions.
  
How might I be able to overcome this re-connection(?) issue with quarto or rmarkdown documents and still use eglot?
 Alternatively, how can I enable eglot just for *.r or *.R files and not just for ess-r-mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I added flycheck onto the list package-selected-packages and ran (package-install-selected-packages) after reopening Emacs:
 (setq package-selected-packages '(use-package lsp-mode lsp-ui lsp-treemacs dap-mode company-mode flycheck prism aggressive-indent haskell-mode lsp-haskell)) 
 Then, I added this to my init.el (I use use-package):
 (use-package flycheck :init (global-flycheck-mode)) 
 However, even after doing that, when I open Emacs, I still get this error:
 Error (use-package): flycheck/:init: Symbol’s function definition is void: global-flycheck-mode
 It's strange, because even though I installed flycheck, the function seems to be undefined. The use-package configuration is what they recommend on their website, as well (scroll to find the use-package section), so I don't think the problem is calling (global-flycheck-mode).
 Does anyone have tips for what I should do next?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have a created a class called Task that contains SignalRef and then an instance from that class
 case class Task(id: String,, cancel: IO[SignallingRef[IO, Boolean]]) val task = Task(randomUUID().toString, SignallingRef[IO, Boolean](false)) 
 Thereafter, I put the task in a Map and calling it from two different streams.
 The first one is called from an HTTP request to set its value to “true”
  case DELETE -> Root / "tasks" / UUIDVar(taskId) => taskMap.get(taskId.toString) match { case Some(task) => for{ switch <- task.cancel _ <- switch.set(true).start >> IO.println("canceled") res <- Ok(task.toOutput.asJson) } yield res case None => NotFound("Not Found") 
 and the other one is called from a "stream.interruptWhen" to cancel the stream when the value become "true"
  val httpStream = for { cancelSwitch <- Stream.eval(task.cancel) httpStream <- client .stream(req) .flatMap(_.body) .through(decodeUsingHeaders[CsvRow[String]]()) .interruptWhen(cancelSwitch) .map(x => x.toMap) .map(x => x.asJson.noSpaces + "\n") .through(text.utf8.encode) .through(Files[IO].writeAll(Path(s"jsons/${task.id}.json"), Flags.Write)) } yield httpStream httpStream.compile.drain 
 And it appears that I am doing something wrong because they don't communicate with each other.
 P.S. I am Golang developer interested in the functional programming of Scala and its libraries CE3, FS2 and ZIO

Are there more abstract concepts in Haskell? Such as higher category theory and the Yoneda lemma. I've heard category theory be described as the linguistics of mathematics, so it only makes sense for it to have actually been used on a language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. 
 I use Doom Emacs with lsp enabled. 
 I develop in PHP using Laravel framework. There's a package called laravel-ide-helper that creates stub classes to help on IDE completion for properties and magic methods. 
 The problem is, when I x-ref-find I get two results, one for the correct method and another for the stub (they are all in a file called _ide_helper.php). 
 Is there a way I can filter out these results? Maybe blacklist the filename somehow?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I came across this stackoverflow post and tried to implement my own StateIO monad where I could perform IO actions. Here is my code:
 {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} import Control.Monad.Trans import Control.Monad (ap, liftM) newtype StateIO s a = StateIO {runStateIO :: s -> IO (a, s)} instance Functor (StateIO s) where fmap = liftM instance Applicative (StateIO s) where pure = return (<*>) = ap instance Monad (StateIO s) where return a = StateIO $ \s -> return (a, s) n >>= k = StateIO $ \s -> do (a, s') <- runStateIO n s runStateIO (k a) s instance MonadIO (StateIO s) where liftIO io = StateIO $ \st -> do x <- io return (x, st) class Monad m => MonadStateIO s m | m -> s where getSt :: m s putSt :: s -> m () instance MonadStateIO s (StateIO s) where getSt = StateIO $ \st -> return (st,st) putSt st = StateIO $ const $ return ((),st) 
 Then I run a simple program where the user inputs a positive integer n and I return the first n fibonacci numbers with the use of the StateIO monad. 
 type FibNums = [Int] main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "How many fibonacci numbers do you want to see:" n <- (read <$> getLine) :: IO Int let initialState = [n,0,1] process initialState process :: FibNums -> IO () process st = do (finished, newSt) <- runStateIO addFib st print finished -- for debugging print newSt -- for debugging if finished then do putStrLn "Fibonacci numbers are:" print $ tail newSt else process newSt addFib :: StateIO FibNums Bool addFib = do st <- getSt let newSt = st ++ [last st + last (init st)] finished = length (tail newSt) == head newSt liftIO $ print newSt -- for debugging putSt newSt return finished 
 The problem is in the function addFib the line "putSt newSt" does not really update the FibNums state variable and the initial state is returned. So the program loops on forever. 
 Any ideas what am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often find myself switching between Emacs and terminal (e.g. xterm). A typical example is to run a test suite after editing some code. For years, I've been looking for a clean way to send code directly to a terminal without copy-pasting, and I think I finally found it. Best hack I've come up with in 12 years of using this editor. Here it is:
  
Install the absolutely excellent vterm package:https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm
 Create the following script, put it somewhere reasonable:#!/bin/bashemacsclient -e "(progn (vterm) (vterm-send-string \"$*\") (vterm-send-return))"
 Install ob-tmux and configure:https://github.com/ahendriksen/ob-tmux(setq org-babel-tmux-terminal "<PATH TO THE BASH SCRIPT ABOVE>")(setq org-babel-tmux-terminal-opts nil)
 Enjoy!
 (e.t.a: with (setq vterm-enable-manipulate-selection-data-by-osc52 t) you also get integration between tmux visual mode and the kill-ring, which depending on your habits may be a more ergonomic way to copy/paste between terminal and emacs)

 As part of a project at university, I'm looking to formalize and implement a small DSL for proving statements in first-order logic based on Fitch notation. I'm going to implement this in Haskell.
 The implementation itself would not be a huge problem if I were to go by intuition alone, seeing as natural deduction in first-order logic is quite simple. However, since this is a project for university, I wanted to ask if you guys can recommend some interesting papers on various techniques and approaches (e.g. dependent type theory) that might be of use to me?
 Thanks!

 Currently, I have M-Backspace mapped to backward-kill-word be default, but I do not want to get used to that one because I use C-Backspace outside of Emacs. What is the best solution here? I have looked online and did not find solutions that work exactly like I want. Some remapped C-h which is not what I want to do.
 I am using wsl 2 ubuntu if that matters at all.

 For some reason, persp-mode isn’t loaded on initialization. What’s more interesting is it doesn’t load if I run persp-mode after Emacs is loaded, I have to execute persp-mode two times for it to work properly. Working properly for me means that C-c w prefix works.
 Any idea what I’m doing wrong?

 Suppose I have the following JSON:

 "type" can have a lot of values and in essence decides what "someObject" will be. I will omit moreFieldsAlwaysKnown for brevity. 
 I like typesafety so I naively thought I would encode this statically to make it users of my lib very difficult to create invalid values and track everything on the typelevel. In essence: 
 import qualified My.Module.Containing.SomeObject as SO -- Every "type" that can be transmitted over the wire. data MyType = SomeType | SomeOtherType | SomeMoreType -- Typeclass allowing to go from type -> value level. Serving…]]></summary>

 Where helper and performCheck require the implicit user argument. Actually there's almost identical calls to more than one helper (and more than 5 params, don't get me started about that), but I think the pattern is clear.
 I'd like to refactor that into something like
 class DoerOffStuff { doIt(typeArg) { (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5) => { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, typeArg, arg3, arg4,arg5) } } val doItThisWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_A) val doItThatWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_B) val doItAnotherWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_C) } 
 I want to avoid having to type the argument list in the class definition, so I wanted to stick with val instead.
 Is there a way I can do that?
 I tried
 class DoerOffStuff { doIt(typeArg) { (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user) => { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, typeArg, arg3, arg4,arg5) } } val doItThisWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_A) val doItThatWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_B) val doItAnotherWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_C) } 
 but the the type checker will say "could not find implicit value for parameter user" for all places of ... = doIt(...)

What's important though is that these workflows are about switching between different types of file -- it would be very cumbersome to add all of the different pairs manually.

 Hi guys. I know this must be possible. But can you give me some examples in Haskell? Something like representing naturals and booleans with types, writing plus and if/else for them, etc.
 ​
 BTW, is Haskell's type inference engine Turing complete? I guess the answer is no. But why? Does UndecidableInstances have anything to do with this?
 ​
 Obviously, this question doesn't have a lot of practical value. It's a rabbit hole. Sorry for that. I'm just interested. And would be glad to hear from FP experts in our Reddit giving me some hints.

 Right now I use a custom build script with a custom buildHook that extracts the extra-source-files from the cabal file and builds them according to some build rules written in shake.
 How are bigger projects accomplishing this? Are they just using a makefile. Are they dropping cabal alltogether and only use shake? I know thats what GHC is doing, with their hadrian build system.
 I would love to hear of your experiences with different approaches! And yes I am procrastinating writing the thing I want to write really hard right now.

 After interacting with some redditors and doing some more research I wrote this comment where I concluded that the way Sublime Text handles line composed of whitespace is the most intuitive for me, at least when editing Python source files. Which can be summarized as:
 If I'm editing a buffer with the following Python code
 if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅print('2x⋅True')$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅| 
 where ⋅ represents a space, $ represents a newline and | represents the cursor, if I press Return I want Emacs to end up like
 if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅print('2x⋅True')$ $ ⋅⋅⋅⋅|

 ld: warning: -undefined dynamic_lookup may not work with chained fixups 
 I've already cleared out ~/.stack, so it should not be using any old artifacts, with all artifacts being rebuilt on 12.6.
 It's not that big of a deal, but it would be nice to get rid of it.
 Note: I was running into warnings like
 ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/opt/postgresql@12/lib/libpq.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (12.0) than being linked (11.1) 
 I fixed this by completely uninstalling Homebrew, reinstalling xcode-select, and reinstalling everything. I suspect I'm getting this new warning because xcode-select upgraded ld.

My apologies if the title sounds vague, I'm looking for advice or project ideas to secure an introduction to frameworks such as Play,‍ Akka and Spark. and to how they are being used in real world applications. I have some background in Rust, so getting familiar with Scala was pretty straightforward. I'm loving the language a lot and how natural it feels. However, I would like to start building some hobby projects by using the aforementioned frameworks if possible, but I'm not really sure where to start, or which of them is more beginner-intermediate-friendly. May I ask; does anyone mind suggesting a learning roadmap or drop some project suggestions/ideas? I'd deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance. Stay safe and healthy everyone.

It's not the first time I've heard people be dismissive of long time Emacs/Vim users. My last personal experience was someone telling me flat out I was wasting company time playing around with Emacs rather than using Pycharm.
 I have also gotten into long arguments that devolve into "feature-offs" where I have to explain how a feature VSCode has is also in Emacs. I tried to explain that you can use GDB in Emacs, and someone literally laughed at me because GDB is "ancient" and VSCode's debugging is modern and actually gets stuff done. It seems like even if Emacs can do something it's also A. Not good enough B. Takes too long to configure instead of just getting the job done.
 So please give me some advice on how I should combat this encroachment on my peaceful Emacs pasture. Or should I just give up my goats and switch to VSCode?

 Im having a lot of fun taking my university (electronic engineering) notes in org-mode, using org-fragtog to toggle org-latex-preview and see math equations take life in real time.
 I'd really like to do the same thing with circuits, so I'm trying to use these tikz and circuitikz packages that let you draw circuits in latex.
 It compiles just fine, in fact when I export to pdf (SPC-m-e-l-o) the drawings are there.
 org-latex-preview also seem to try, very hard the first times I go over something, so my best guess is it's actually compiling and actually thinking it's showing it regularly, but no it doesn't. 
 Has someone had any similar experience? or any idea on how to move forward? 
 Thank you guys

 and disjunctive normal form
 dnf :: Form -> Form dnf (Var s) = ((Var s)) dnf (p :\/: q) = (dnf p) :/\: (dnf q) dnf (p :/\: q) = undefined dnf (Not (Not p)) = dnf p dnf (Not (p :/\: q)) = (dnf $ Not p) :/\: (dnf $ Not q) dnf (Not (p :\/: q)) = undefined dnf (Not (Var s)) = Not (Var s) 
 i am struggling to get my dnf function to work properly or finding a correct approach. ive been using the nnf as reference for myself but any help/ suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Don’t worry (about writing Haskell), be happy (writing Agda instead)! by Jesper Cockx
As we all know, static type systems are great to ensure correctness of our programs. Sadly, in industry many people are forced to work in languages with a weak type system, such as Haskell.
Haskell and Visual Studio by Monday Morning Haskell
Most of the IDEs out there use graphical interfaces that let you use the mouse. Today we’ll explore one of those options - Visual Studio (aka VS Code).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was inspired by a question at the end of the Being lazy without being bloated presentation about the library nothunks, which asked if it was possible to do the same check statically.
 I managed to come up with a type class IsStrict which will give a type error if there is a non-strict field anywhere, at any depth, in the data structure given, explaining where the non-strict field is.
 Here it is in a gist: https://gist.github.com/anka-213/440cfef8c8712f5df747029640cfe170
 For example, if one were to ask if String is strict, it would give this error:  Found lazy field of type Char • In constructor: : • In type: [Char] • When checking strictness of: String Found lazy field of type [Char] • In constructor: : • In type: [Char] • When checking strictness of: String 
 It still works if we put the string inside some other data type, e.g. a strict pair ``` data StrictPair a b = P !a !b deriving Generic
 -- Non-strict type in strict field -- >>> nfStrict @(StrictPair Int String) -- Found lazy field of type Char -- • In constructor: : -- • In type: [Char] -- • In strict field of type [Char] -- • In constructor: P -- • In type: StrictPair Int String -- • When checking strictness of: StrictPair Int String -- ... ```
 This is of course more strict than checking nothunks, since you might have forced the data in some other way, so the data is thunk-free without having the data type be fully strict.

 I'm using a clean Emacs (v. 26) and have installed slime on it.
 I've got the following hello.cl and init.el
 https://gist.github.com/LucyJohnson-lua4life/e8c97bf931b7fd5795f5b9b22739c19d.
 I started "slime" and executed "slime-compile-and-load-file" on hello.cl, then i moved my cursor to the "some-function" symbol and executed "slime-who-calls". By now I would expect slime to show me the 3 other lines where "some-function" was executed but instead i got "No references found for some-function".
 Can somebody explain me how to fix this, or how to debug that?

I don't have a trash can folder on my system so its rather impossible to have moved it there by mistake. 
 Does emacs, or dired provide any sort of "history of moved files" or something similar that will help me find the file?

 the only thing i miss is being able to see the code actions available in the modeline and the project error list from flymake (not just the current buffer) in the modeline.
 It would be nice if there was a way to go to the previous/next error in project.
 anyone would know how to do that?
 flymake-show-project-diagnostics with eglot is so much better than lsp-treemacs tho, i love it just for that...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having recently been bitten by an unexpected failed Future, I was wondering if there is anything like a "safe" wrapper for Futures. Basically, the goal is to make concurrent API's inside an application not to have the hidden back-channel behaviour, yet still be composable in the usual way. A minimal implementation might be on the base Future to do a .transformWith(t => Future.successful(t.toEither)) and then return that or wrap in EitherT, maybe wrapping either of those result types.
 Would need to support stack-safe flatMap for Cats-effect. 
 Just speculating, thinking aloud here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I'm trying to wean myself off the actor model. I've grown used to thinking of systems as supervision trees. How to represent these trees without actors? E.g., let's imagine this tree structure is my app:
 - app: my app - scheduler: should wake up every quarter hour (0m, 15m, 30m, 45m) and perform a task - my_svc_pool: connection pool to a service that is called from within the scheduled task - my_svc: connection to my service - my_svc: another connection to my service 
 So let's say scheduler wakes up, tries to run its task by calling out to my_svc_pool, but the particular connection that it got routed to in the pool happened to get disconnected right before that. So the service call fails and scheduler blows up and goes away, leaving my app running without the 15-minute scheduled tasks that were supposed to happen.
 How would you structure an app with futures or tasks or any effect system (leaving aside actors) to supervise the system as a whole such that:
  
If a service connection in the connection pool happened to get disconnected and we just found out, my_svc_pool should safely dispose of it and replace it
 If scheduler blows up on waking up and trying to perform its task, app should replace it with a fresh one

 There is most likely another better way of accomplishing this, but I made the function below. In case if it is useful to anyone, it goes over an org file and builds and outputs a list of all tangled directives. Like clickable links:

 It can be used as a poor man's toc.

In this post I will describe the approach that I’ve recently introduced in rules_haskell
to achieve clear, maintainable and efficient tests for Bazel rules.

Why even bother?
All software needs to be tested and verified, and Bazel rules are no exception. Some of them are
popular public libraries with a lot of projects depending on them, and they need a proper test set
to allow every contributor, frequent or occasional, to propose a change with little risk of breaking the
public API those rules represents. The same applies to the rules that live in huge monorepos growing every day,
where they often act as a glue between different components and can become complex, tricky and fragile.
Also every Bazel rule introduces…]]></summary>

 How can I do this with ZIO? I tried memoize, but, if I map over the task 2 times within a for, it is "cached", but if I call getFruits() 2 times from a zio-http api, well, it goes to the DB again.
 So I have something like this
 DAO:
 case class QueryService(quill: Quill.Cassandra[Literal]) { val fruits: Quoted[EntityQuery[Fruit]] = quote { querySchema[Fruit]("fruits") } } object QueryService { val live: URLayer[Quill.Cassandra[Literal], QueryService] = ZLayer.fromFunction(QueryService(_)) } case class FruitsDao(queryService: QueryService) { def allFruits: Task[Seq[Fruit]] = run( queryService.fruits ) } object FruitsDao { val live: ZLayer[QueryService, Nothing, FruitsDao] = ZLayer.fromFunction(FruitsDao(_)) } 
 service:
  val fruits: Task[Seq[Fruit] = dao.allFruits def getFruits(): Task[Seq[Fruit]] = { val res = for { f <- fruits //f2 <- fruits // memoize would only help here } yield doSomethingWithFruits(fruits) 
 and this is called from zio-http

 When I insert a new line in my Java file, I get a lovely, sexy tab for indentation inserted automatically.
 When I press the backspace key to delete the tab, all my tabs are changed into spaces. This disgusts me. It angers me. I am close to homicidal.
 Does anyone know how to stop this?
 I have tried running "indent-tabs-mode t", but that does nothing, which makes sense, because tabs are already enabled.
 The functionality I want is simple. Tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment. When I delete a tab, it deletes the tab. When I delete a space, it deletes the space.
 I've been googling for quite a while, and can't seem to figure it out.

 I'm creating a wrapper around a pre-compiled C library (GLFW, I know bindings exist, it's for figuring out how to use the Haskell FFI in a practical setting), and I haven't been able to figure out how to get stack to include the C headers in the build. 
 This means that my build works, but I get a number of warnings about implicit function declarations during compilation. e.g.:
 C:\Users\****\AppData\Local\Temp\ghc23648_0\ghc_5.c:8:61: error: warning: implicit declaration of function 'glfwInit' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration] 8 | HsInt32 ghczuwrapperZC1ZCmainZCMainZCglfwInit(void) {return glfwInit();} [...] 8 | HsInt32 ghczuwrapperZC1ZCmainZCMainZCglfwInit(void) {return glfwInit();} 
 I figured out how to add C libraries in package.yaml with extra-lib-dirs: and extra-libraries:. Unfortunately, when I browse the internet, the field it suggests for adding headers in Cabal, includes:, doesn't actually get recognized by Stack:
 C:\Users\****\Workspace\Testing\ffitest\package.yaml: Ignoring unrecognized field $.executables.ffitest-exe.includes 
 Just to be sure, I tried to use the same field in stack.yaml instead, just in case it would be recognized there. It causes the same error.
 What is the appropriate way to include C header files in a Stack project, assuming there is one?

 Hi everyone,
 Today I finally decided to not just watch videos about Haskell but giving it a quick try to see how it works and feels.
 Since I just wanted to get a feel, I didn't want to start installing everything (especially because it was more than one step like downloading one file and installing it, lazy here) so I just went for the many Haskell browser consoles (replit for example) and I just couldn't do anything that I see in the many YouTube tutorials because of this "main =" thingy. I then tried with a "main = do" and writing under it but nothing works as in the tutorial, example "sumOfNums = [1..1000]" among many others.
 What can I do if I want to just play around, test basic functions etc in a browser ? It seems that I am supposed to already know some level of coding architecture and in every basic tutorial I watched there isn't any mention of such main = ...
 It's puzzling me how incredibly complicated this simple beginner step seems to be when comparing to, say, groovy web console, in which you can just type things, functions, classes etc...
 Thanks guys !

 The HTML document is a drama from gutenberg.org.
 What libraries would you recommend for that? Would tagsoup or HandsomeSoup be good choice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The transient package has a macro transient-define-prefix (docs). The following defines a complete prefix:
 (setq l1 '(("vl" "visual lines" visual-line-mode))) (transient-define-prefix foo1 () "docstring" [:pad-keys t ["Appearance" l1]]) 
 (The macro allows for a list of "elements" like l1 to be interpolated, something like a ,@ splice in a backtick context.)
 But having the variable l1 lying around feels like a loose end. The following approach looks better:
 (let ((l2 '(("vl" "visual lines" visual-line-mode)))) (transient-define-prefix foo2 () "docstring" [:pad-keys t ["Appearance" l2]])) 
 But it fails with "Symbol’s value as variable is void: l2"
 My understanding of elisp scope is clearly lacking.
 Is the problem that the transient-define-prefix macro is expanded within the let scope but the result is not evaluated until after the let scope is discarded? The elisp documentation for macros says that "[t]he Lisp interpreter proceeds to evaluate the expansion as soon as it comes back from the macro" but I may be misunderstanding this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to implement the following function, for working with cyclical musical scales:
 cyclicIndex :: [a] -> Int -> a -- cyclicIndex is total in its second argument -- provided its first argument is total and not infinite cyclicIndex xs i = xs !! (i mod N) where N = length xs i mod N = unique representative of NZ+i in [0..N) 
 My attempt is
 cyclicIndex :: [a] -> Int -> a cyclicIndex xs i = if i >= 0 then (cycle xs) !! i else (cycle (reverse xs)) !! (-1-i) 
 This seems to work, and the function is a simple enough function, but I am having trouble reasoning about its correctness from my specification. My attempts at calculating its correctness runs into confusion about mod in Haskell and mod in maths. In particular, I noted down the laws
  
cycle xs !! i = xs !! (mod n i) for i >= 0 (note the mod is Haskell's mod)
 reverse xs !! i = xs !! (N - 1 - i) for i in [0..N)
 cycle . reverse = reverse . cycle? (A free theorem? Useful?)
  
How might we approach this correctness problem?

 I want to run emacs inside a development container (as I'm using Fedora Silverblue), but I'm having a weird issue:
 My config files are all in ~/.config/emacs/, but just after the launch of the container (distrobox-enter), emacs creates ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d and ignores the config folder.
 If I stop emacs, delete ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d and restart emacs, my init.el in ~/.config/emacs/ is considered and emacs starts configured the proper way.
 For now I think I will just move my config folder, but if you think this is an issue I might need to report on the mailing list, or if you can help me investigate a bit more, feel free to help me!

 any time i evaluate the code block passing variable b into function (it's external file's table) it puts that external file top into buffer-flip (as if i just switched from that external file).
 example say i flip between buffer1 (where above code block is) and buffer 2 (buffer1 > buffer2 > buffer 1 > buffer 2, etc), but when i evaluate the code buffer flip becomes (buffer 1 > external file > buffer 1 > eternal file)
 if i evalute the code passing variable a into function (local table) - buffer flip works correctly.

I've got a lot of my config working already, but I don't get how to do external package-management at all. My config is littered with :ensure-system-package statements that all fail. I've installed Debian subsystem and also mingw, but I don't get how I can tie either of them in. I have found a few blog-posts about Emacs on Windows, but those were more about trivial things that I were able to figure out on my own.
 So. 1) Does the concept of PATH exist on Windows? \ 1.1) Can the PATH be changed to include something either from mingw or Debian subsystem?
 Looks like starting up the subsystem takes some time, so I'm also worried about performance. \ 2) Should I be going about this in another way entirely?

I was having a conversation one day and I couldn’t recall the name of a term, something I learned from a YouTube video. That bothered me. After the chat I went back to YouTube, found the video, and started searching through it. I increased the playback speed and went back and forth but still couldn’t find it. After a few minutes of that struggle, I thought: “what the heck am I doing?”. Then I wrote a tiny elisp function to extract subtitles. While reading through the subs I realized how much good stuff went past my ears (while watching the video).
  
It's tiny and very simple, but I think can be used already.

Although this is enough to do basic editing, I would like to learn emacs "the emacs way", as I'm not a vimmer. I'm just using doom emacs as a crutch while I get comfortable with emacs and lisp.
 ​
 Anyway, I've tried the following:
 comment out (evil +everywhere) with two semi colons in "~/.doom.d/init.el"
 ran doom sync
 added (package! evil-mode :disable t) to "packages.el"
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 deleted (evil +everywhere) from "init.el" completely
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 removed +bindings from :config default in "init.el"
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 ​
 I'm not sure what else I should try.
 ​
 EDIT: rebooted my machine and evil is no more. Not sure at which point I could/should have rebooted but here we are.

 In vim, I currently have it set up so that when a line soft wraps, it will be indented by one tab width compared to the first line, as seen here: https://imgur.com/X6GTuaL
 In emacs, I have visual-line-mode and org-indent-mode enabled, which makes the soft wrapped lines flush with the first line (seen here: https://imgur.com/4xfBZnJ). I searched through google and any settings I could think of, but cannot find a way to indent the wrapped lines in emacs the same was as it is in vim.
 Is there a setting I'm missing, or a package that will do this for me? If not, is this something that could be done in lisp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've encountered a design issue several times, and I'm wondering what approach is most consistent with Haskell idioms/best practices.
 I'm implementing a data structure, call it Z a, with an interface for manipulating it where almost all of the functions in the interface return a Z a, with many of the form Z a -> Z a or b -> Z a -> Z a. But for a few of the functions there's no valid result for some edge case inputs, and it makes sense in those situations to return Maybe (Z a). 
 Now at that point, it makes sense to have every function in the interface return Maybe (Z a) because I can then sequence my operations nicely with >>= 
 z :: Z a z >>= op1 >>= op2 >>= (op3 x) >>= (op4 1 2) 
 or something like
 pipe :: (Foldable t, Monad m) => a -> t (a -> m a) -> m a pipe = foldM (&) z :: Z a pipe z [op1, op2, op3 x, op4 1 2] 
 This is pretty convenient, I suppose, but then just one or two operations that have a Maybe result changed the entire interface to the data structure. An alternative would be to make the data structure itself an instance of Monad and make everything again -> Z a. There are several advantages of internalizing, e.g., I can carry some extra information in the Nothing case or even have several failure paths; and several disadvantages -- the non maybe'd functions now have to do the boilerplate to check for the Nothing-ish inputs and pass them along for every function, whereas Maybe does that automatically.
 My question is what are the Haskell best practices/idioms for this decision. Where is the boundary for the choice between internalizing the Monad instance in the data structure type itself and just using something like Maybe for *all* the functions in the interface. 
 I hope my question is clear. Thanks for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Lately, I've been defining my own regular expressions for parsing errors in the *compilation* buffers by adding entries to the compilation-error-regexp-alist and compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variables. However, there's a problem. This list already contains an enormous amount of regular expressions for all kinds of languages that I don't use, however, these regular expressions also match errors of the language that I'm trying to add support to, and this results in extracting incorrect paths to files containing errors. I've set compilation-error-regexp-alist to nil and the problem disappeared, but now when I byte-compile elisp files, I get no way to jump to problems from the compilation buffer (well, duh, the regexp list now doesn't contain an entry for elisp).
 So this creates a problem. I want my regular expressions to be the only ones present in the list when I'm working on a project in this language, and I want other regexps to be available when I'm working on other projects. I've thought about using dir-locals.el but my regexps use functions to get the file out of the error message, and I can't put that into dir-locals reliably.
 Another problem is that the compilation-error-regexp-alist contains names of the languages it supports, but for example, there's no elisp or emacs-lisp entry, yet the byte-compile warnings are highlighted correctly. And there's no way to see what regular expressions are responsible for the matches in the compilation buffer, so it's hard to debug what's overriding mine.
 TL;DR: Ideally, I want compilation-error-regexp-alist to be configurable per project but I use custom functions that can break other people's configurations who work on the same project as me and load dir-locals.el

So I only need a string (or could be float or double) from a website but the website directly pulls the string from the backend which isnt connected to the frontend. So, it needs to find any text from a specified CSS division. Then I can just parse the text and filter out things that I dont need. Which library will fit this?

 When using org capture templates with expansion variables I often find it's confusing because you don't know what information you're being promoted to insert.
 For instance, if asked to a URL and then a description, all you see in the minibuffer is "clipboard/kill value:" repeatedly.
 Is there a way to customise that prompt? Or maybe have placeholders with useful names in the template that get overwritten?

 Does anyone have a hack that does this? I know that the project is essentially unmaintained at this point, but hopefully there's someone in the community who knows. I think it would involve using the Conversation ID in the new API and using something like the existing twittering-get-replied-statuses function.

 Here's the problem. I'm trying to find definitions for a struct, but eglot can't find it.
 ​
 file.cpp has a function
 function (struct type_t *t1, ...) {
 type_t *temp = t1; // this line here
 }
 ​
 When I do xref-find-definition for type_t, it simply shows me the "struct type_t *t1" in the file above.
 type_t is defined in another header, which this file includes. Why can't eglot/xref jump to the definition in the file that defines type_t? lsp-mode, there's no issue at all. (I am compiling my code with bear to get a compile_commands.json file).
 ​
 What am I missing?

 It would take quite a bit of time (we are talking 0.3s but enough to be annoying) to exit the normal mode when inside a tmux session. It would then do some crazy things too between those 0.3s if I start typing some letters...
 I discovered this spacemacs issue and buried in the comments this tmux setting : 
 set -s escape-time 0 
 which works exactly as intended and give you an exit to normal mode straight away...
 so if anyone else has this issue and find this post then I guess you are welcome internet stranger :)

 Does it have anything similar for reading E-mail?
 Most modes that I know of are part of another package (like Gnus or Wanderlust or Mew, etc.) but lets imagine I've fetched my E-mail via some other means; home-grown, if you will.
 I, now, want to read them but I don't want to roll my own mode to do so; repurposing another package's for this purpose would probably likewise be fine so long as it could be isolated from the rest of the package (e.g. mh-show? But we'd want to avoid accidentally triggering mh-rmail while using mh-show, for example).
 I can't seem to find a Mail mode equivalent but for reading mail, instead of sending.

 My reasons. Sometimes I need to move things around, align, or split to have a clearer structure. AUCTeX does not seem to respond well for that kind of manual writing and neglect all the work after hitting TAB or ENTER.
 I used to work with Atom, in which idea about indentation was very simple: when I decided to move cursor two extra tabs to the right, all following lines would hold on that indentation until I'd changed it. This helped me to structure long equations to see them better.
 I hope whatever I wrote make sense.

 This works really well, now I can add or remove rows and c-c c-c the formula to get the numbers back in order.
 But I want to do the same for dates. I can write functions (in/decremement date), but I don't understand how I would hook them up to the tblfm thing... Any suggestions?
 Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working through this blog post on building a simple interpreter, which uses the type Expr Value to describe an expression which evaluates to a value, and Expr (Value -> Value) to describe an expression which evaluates to a function. 
 Now, the type constructor Expr has kind *->* by default, which I think is too general. I see no situation when we would put anything other than functions involving Value into it, and I think it could count as a programmer error if there was a value Expr a, where a is not in F, where F ::= Value | F -> F.
 Questions:
  
Is there a way to enforce this constraint in Haskell, e.g. using type families?
 Is there a nice way to describe F in Haskell?
  
One additional challenge is that data Expr a = ClosedExpr a | OpenExpr Name (Expr (Value -> a)) has useful functor and applicative instances, which I hope can remain.

This will be the next paper I will process. It is highly relevant for the next material for the Zettelkasten Method. Right now, I am processing the application to physics which is also a nice read.
To me, the key learning for the Zettelkasten Method is the heavy emphasis on decision making. I can't express it precise enough to communicate it nicely. But there is a striking similarity to learning the Zettelkasten Method. Right now, many people try to learn it as if they learn something from a textbook. It feels rather "formulaic". But it is important to get a feel for the implicit decisions you make through your actions. Yes, there are principles and good practices.

Specifically, the pain points with TRAMP shows up mostly in dired and magit, where the turnaround speed (time spent to open a folder in dired, or time spend in any magit command) is quite high. I suspect this is due to the underlying process that TRAMP uses to connect to my remote server. My remote connection is relatively fast (100Mbps+). Things that I have tried till now are:
  
For my remote server, set the following flags in .ssh/config such that TRAMP re-uses the connections
  
 Host myfasthost ... Compression yes ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p ControlMaster auto ControlPersist 90m 
  
I use scp protocol to connect to TRAMP in dired. For example, to open a remote folder /path/to/my/folder, I use the following:
  
 /scp:myfasthost:/path/to/my/folder 
 Is there any other protocols I can use to ensure faster connections? Or any other tips/hacks to improve the TRAMP dired+magit experience? TIA!

 I am about to start a new project in Haskell, model checking with (new) tree-like data structures. I think it is best to start building on a library such that i can already have elegant base functions, yet i am wondering what library is currently the standard? I read about fgl ( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl ), yet it is a very old library. 
 It is a proof-of-concept project, thus i would like to do this in Haskell (clean mathematical code + modularity) instead of a lower level language (C++, C).
 In my project i will need: 
  
memoization (during a recursive depth-first traversal)
 
labelled edges
 
nodes have values corresponding to a ordinal indicating their level.
 
some special nodes which transform my traversal function's interpretation.
 
labelled leaf nodes
 
 Any recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After trying to refresh my email setup, I ended up mistakenly (i.e. deliberately, but without considering the consequence) updating mu and mu4e. I was on version 1.5.5, and I've ended up on 1.8.9.
 This upgrade does seem to break a lot of my little tweaks to mu4e. I've managed to sort a few of these out, e.g. mu4e~proc-remove-id becomes mu4e--server-remove-id, mu4e~mark-check-target becomes mu4e--mark-check-target .
 But there are still a few bugs. I previously stole a function to convert an email to a .pdf file:
 (defun mu4e-action-open-to-pdf (msg) (let* ((date (mu4e-message-field msg :date)) (infile (mu4e~write-body-to-html msg)) (outfile (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d%H%M%S.pdf" date))) (with-temp-buffer (shell-command (format "wkhtmltopdf %s ~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s" infile outfile) t)) (interactive) (find-file (format "~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s" outfile) ) )) 
 Now mu4e~write-body-html is no longer defined.
 My questions are:
  
Is there a replacement for mu4e~write-body-html? Or a different method to convert a message to pdf?
 
I've tried to follow the release notes here, but find it hard to follow... for instance, the releases jump from 1.4.15 to 1.6.0? (So where is 1.5.5?) Is there a compilation of all these changes from e.g. ~ to -- and other general refactoring?
 
 EDIT:
 Just found this warning in the documentation:
 The whole of mu4e consists of hundreds of elisp functions. However, the majority of those are for internal use only; you can recognize them easily, because they all start with mu4e~ or mu4e--. These functions make all kinds of assumptions, and they are subject to change, and should therefore not be used. 
 which explains the instability. Didn't see this/know enough about elisp when I stole the functions. Fair enough.

I barely use C-u anyway, and this places C-x right under the pointer in the home row, which is very comfortable. Common sequences like C-x C-s and C-x C-e become optimal homerow rolls.
  
I was wondering how to do that natively in emacs without using karabiner/xmodmap or other OS dependent solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announcing the posit-3.2 library, where Real numbers are approximated by Maybe Rational. The Posit type is mapped to a 2's complement integer type; smoothly and with tapering precision, in a similar way to the projective real line.
 The implementation includes word sizes from 8 to 256 bits.
 The library is implemented with several Haskell Language extensions:
 {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} -- For our main type Posit (es :: ES) {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} -- For our ES kind and the constructors Z, I, II, III, IV, V for exponent size type {-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-} -- For defining the type of kind ES that indexes the GADT {-# LANGUAGE ViewPatterns #-} -- To decode the posit in the pattern {-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-} -- Added Strictness for some fixed point algorithms {-# LANGUAGE PatternSynonyms #-} -- for a nice NaR interface {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} -- To make instances for each specific type from Posit8 to Posit256 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-} -- Allow non-type variables in the constraints {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-} -- To apply types: with '@', it seems to select the specific class instance {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} -- To convert between Posit Types {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} -- To reduce some code duplication {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-} -- To reduce some code duplication, I think the code is decidable but GHC is not smart enough ;) 
 The one area that I think Haskell or my understanding of Haskell can improve is with some code duplication in the internal 'PositC' class. It would be neat to be able to make default implementations of class functions that are polymorphic over an associated type.
 Enjoy!

 I tried this in both org-cdlatex-mode and .tex files. Things marked as TEXT or TEXT/MATH in org-cdlatex-command-help work, the ones marked as MATH don't - pressing tab just moves the cursor out of the math environment

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use the builtin completion at point in eshell to complete command arguments. E.g in eshell I'd type cd and hit <TAB>:
 ~ $ cd 
 to open up the *Completions* buffer. Im currently using emacs 29.0.50 (commit 72c64dd73c), and so M-<down> and M-<up> can cycle through the completions (directories in this case with the cd command), while keeping the eshell buffer focused. The problem I'm facing now is how to actually insert the currently highlighted completion into my eshell buffer. Clicking on the completion with the mouse will insert it into eshell, as well as switching focus to the *Completions* buffer and hitting RET over it, but I'm trying to do this without having to switch focus from eshell. M-<up> and M-<down>, added new in emacs 29, allow cycling through completions while keeping focus in the current window (my eshell in this case), but I cant select one. The command minibuffer-choose-completion, which is bound to M-RET returns an error saying "Text is read only", which I think is happening because it is trying to insert the completion into the minibuffer and not my eshell window. Moreover, completion-at-point for symbols in elisp files works as intended with M-RET, but not for eshell. Any help on how to sort this would be great. Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running the following R code in a code block in org-mode.
 #+begin_src R :session :results output latex :exports results library(ggplot2) library(xtable) x <- rnorm(1000) g0 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(x), aes(x)) + geom_histogram(); g0 hist_dat <- ggplot_build(g0)$data[[1]] hist_dat <- hist_dat |> select(xmin, xmax, count) print(xtable(hist_dat, digits = c(0, 1, 1, 0)), include.rownames = FALSE) #+end_src 
 This creates the expected LaTeX code:
 \begin{table}[ht] \centering \begin{tabular}{rrr} \hline xmin & xmax & count \\ \hline -3.3 & -3.1 & 1 \\ -3.1 & -2.9 & 1 \\ -2.9 & -2.6 & 0 \\ -2.6 & -2.4 & 5 \\ -2.4 & -2.2 & 7 \\ -2.2 & -1.9 & 14 \\ -1.9 & -1.7 & 11 \\ -1.7 & -1.5 & 20 \\ -1.5 & -1.3 & 35 \\ -1.3 & -1.0 & 49 \\ -1.0 & -0.8 & 64 \\ -0.8 & -0.6 & 67 \\ -0.6 & -0.3 & 108 \\ -0.3 & -0.1 & 90 \\ -0.1 & 0.1 & 98 \\ 0.1 & 0.3 & 85 \\ 0.3 & 0.6 & 84 \\ 0.6 & 0.8 & 62 \\ 0.8 & 1.0 & 59 \\ 1.0 & 1.3 & 35 \\ 1.3 & 1.5 & 32 \\ 1.5 & 1.7 & 22 \\ 1.7 & 1.9 & 25 \\ 1.9 & 2.2 & 13 \\ 2.2 & 2.4 & 10 \\ 2.4 & 2.6 & 1 \\ 2.6 & 2.9 & 1 \\ 2.9 & 3.1 & 0 \\ 3.1 & 3.3 & 0 \\ 3.3 & 3.6 & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular} \end{table} 
 However, when I run org-export-dispatch and select export to LaTeX and As PDF file and open, I get nothing in the PDF (neither code nor the results). I wonder what I'm doing wrong.

 I've been using orderless with some custom dispatchers for a while now, but I've always felt like something was wrong or too complex when using the OR operator (regex: \(pattern1\|pattern2\)).
 So today I invested half a hour into learn basics of Elisp string operations and have created my own dispatcher for that.
 (defun or-regexp (pattern index _total) (cond ((string-suffix-p "|" pattern) `(orderless-regexp . ,(concat "\\(" (concat (s-replace "|" "\\|" (substring pattern 0 -1)) "\\)")))) ((string-match-p "|" pattern) `(orderless-regexp . ,(concat "\\(" (concat (s-replace "|" "\\|" pattern) "\\)")))))) 
 I assume it's not the prettiest code, but it's enough for me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In "On Intellectual Craftsmanship" (1952), C. Wright Mills talks about his methods for note taking, thinking, and analysis in what he calls "sociological imagination". This is a sociologists' framing of their own research and analysis practice and thus bears a sociological related name. While he talks more about the thinking, outlining, and writing process rather than the mechanical portion of how he takes notes or what he uses, he's extending significantly on the ideas and methods that Sönke Ahrens describes in How to Take Smart Notes (2017), though obviously he's doing it 65 years earlier. It would seem obvious that the specific methods (using either files, note cards, notebooks, etc.) were a bit more commonplace for his time and context, so he spent more of his time on the finer and tou…]]></summary>

 Now I'd like to pre-compile all the eln files ahead of time, so emacs does not compile the files every time the container spins up again.

 I have set EMACSNATIVELOADPATH which seems to avoid that doom generates eln files in the tmp directory.
 I have set
 (setq native-comp-eln-load-path '("/home/emre/local/lib/emacs/28.2/native-lisp/")) 
 I have tried stuff like
 emacs --debug-init -q --no-site-file --batch --eval "(progn (load \"/home/emre/.emacs.d/early-init.el\") (require 'doom) (require 'doom-lib) (require 'doom-start) (setq package-native-compile t) (setq native-comp-async-jobs-number 8) (setq comp-deferred-compilation nil) (byte-force-recompile \"/home/emre/local/share/emacs/28.2\") (native-compile-async \"/home/emre/local/share/emacs/28.2\" t) (while (or comp-files-queue (> (comp-async-runnings) 0)) (progn (message \"Items left to compile %s\" (length comp-files-queue)) (sleep-for 1))) (kill-emacs))" 
 Which doesn't seem to work either ... 
 Has anyone an idea how I can achieve pre-compiling all eln files, that are shown in the output window?

 (amount of spaces/tabs can very, and number of elements is 3 most of the time, sometimes two)
 And need to paste it either as
 57,655|45,049|45,363 
 Or as
 (57,655)|(45,049)|(45,363) 
 (basically ignore everything except digits and "," and separate elements with "|")
 As i understand i need to create 2 custom paste functions (one regular, one with "()"s) taking original paste function as basis. I found the pasting function (via c-h k):
 (defun cua-paste (arg) "Paste last cut or copied region or rectangle. An active region is deleted before executing the command. With numeric prefix arg, paste from register 0-9 instead. If global mark is active, copy from register or one character." (interactive "P") (setq arg (cua--prefix-arg arg)) (let ((regtxt (and cua--register (get-register cua--register))) (count (prefix-numeric-value arg))) (cond ((and cua--register (not regtxt)) (message "Nothing in register %c" cua--register)) (cua--global-mark-active (if regtxt (cua--insert-at-global-mark regtxt) (when (not (eobp)) (cua--insert-at-global-mark (filter-buffer-substring (point) (+ (point) count))) (forward-char count)))) (buffer-read-only (error "Cannot paste into a read-only buffer")) (t (cond (regtxt (cond ;; This being a cons implies cua-rect is loaded? ((consp regtxt) (cua--insert-rectangle regtxt)) ((stringp regtxt) (insert-for-yank regtxt)) (t (message "Unknown data in register %c" cua--register)))) ((memq this-original-command '(clipboard-yank x-clipboard-yank)) (funcall this-original-command)) (t (yank arg))))))) 
 and as i understand i need to modify "arg" before doing "yank arg", but i have not idea how this "modification" should look like :) Could someone please help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[… would it be possible to implement it?
 I’m thinking of the lambda calculus as purely functional language with only anonymous functions. We could introduce recursion with the Y-combinator (λf. (λx. f (x x)) (λx. f (x x)). In the Haskell idiom it would be: (\f -> (\x -> f (x x)) (\x -> f (x x)) which will give us an error because of Haskell’s type system. 
  • Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: t0 ~ t0 -> t • In the first argument of ‘x2’, namely ‘x2’ In the first argument of ‘f’, namely ‘(x2 x2)’ In the expression: f (x2 x2) • Relevant bindings include x2 :: t0 -> t (bound at <interactive>:19:40) f :: t -> t (bound at <interactive>:19:12) y :: (t -> t) -> t (bound at <interactive>:19:5) 
 Is there any other way we could introduce recursion to Haskell if it wasn’t there already?

It demands the .so module requires recompilation at the drop of a hat. For some reason trying to run vterm after restarting Emacs requires it to be recompiled. It is as if the module itself is missing or Doom detects that some related source files have changed.
 
The vterm windows don't have modelines or titles around them and that makes it hard to tell them apart when they are split. Is there some way to set these?

 This year, I'm participating in Hacktoberfest as a mentor and maintainer. And I'm happy to offer my mentorship in the following two projects:
  
Haskell Beginners 2022 — a Haskell course for complete beginners. It doesn't require any prior FP knowledge at all! And it's format is perfectly suitable for Hacktoberfest. Read more information in how to participate instructions.
 Iris — a Haskell CLI framework I created earlier this year. It's still at the early stage. But it has tons of beginner-friendly issues! Check out issues with the "hacktoberfest" label.
  
Feel free to ask any questions!
 Also, please, don't hesitate to share your projects that participate in Hacktoberfest this year as well! 🤗

 The readme does not specify this, but the Code itself seems fairly small, i tried understanding it (its hard for me to understand), it seems it mentions something about arguments input, and as specified by "man pdf2svg" i should be able to supply page number as argument so i tried doing:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello every one,
 I didn’t pay attention until recently, but I keep seeing the following warning while byte-compiling my preference files:
  Warning: ‘string-as-unibyte’ is an obsolete function (as of 26.1); use ‘encode-coding-string’. 
 I use the following code to convert arbitrary text (usually utf-8, but may be something else):
  (base64-encode-string (string-as-unibyte (buffer-string)) 'no-line-break) 
 I did look at the encode-coding-string, but what bother me is that it seems that I’m obliged to set the original coding-system. But in my case it can change from time to time.
 Is there a way to keep the same "magical" behavior of string-as-unibyte function, with which I didn’t have to assume a possibly wrong source coding system? Am I correct if I say it’d be the undecided coding system? As in:
  (base64-encode-string (encode-coding-string (buffer-string) 'undecided) 'no-line-break) 
 As I’m reading the whole buffer content, is there a (local) variable holding the current buffer coding system?
 Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, my company Mercury is hosting a Haskell meetup on October 20th, 2022 at 6 PM in downtown Portland. If you're interested in giving a talk, we have slots for 25 minute and 5 minute talks. Talks already planned include:
 ​
 Practical STM: An Async Job Queue, by Jake Keuhlen
 ​
  
In this talk, we’ll walk through a brief introduction to concurrency and one of Haskell’s best tools for dealing with it: software transactional memory (STM). We’ll then use STM to build a simple but powerful asynchronous job queue.
  
Make your own Haskell, by Mitchell Vitez
 ​
  
We'll explore the process of making our own Haskell-like language. Composition will lead us to trees, and trees will lead us to languages. We'll grow, trim, typecheck, and reorganize these trees, populating our own little forested enclave. Finally, we'll discover why our language can't really be represented by a tree after all.
  
​
 We'll have pizza delivered and the event will be bartended.
 The event is at the Power + Light Building, at 920 Southwest 6th Avenue.
 Please RSVP here if you're interested: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/haskell-talks-at-mercury-tickets-424633328717. Note: You must RSVP through Eventbrite for building security to let you in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been a Dynalist user for years, as my notes tend to follow a hierarchy, but I’m wanting to transition to org-mode for obvious reasons. When you search a page in Dynalist, you get search results in the context of each parent line ("parent" as determined by indentation level). The same goal is accomplished in ogrep.
 Is this type of search possible in emacs? In org-mode, I know there is sparse-tree, but it is not as "sparse" as ogrep or Dynalist, giving much more context than I sometimes need. This feature is so valuable to me that I'll have to craft a solution with your suggestions if one doesn’t yet exist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem with updating, upgrading and syncing Doom profiles is that you need to ensure that the ~/.doom.d and the path to bin/doom for the profiles do not conflict in your shell and I had to do some experimentation using ~/.emacs-profiles.el and ~/.doom.d/init.el to get this approach working.
 It is based on the idea that when managing your Doom installation with the doom sync, doom build etc commands you run the commands in vterm or term sessions from the same Chemacs2 session.
 You might consider this post an attempt to get others to find any bugs in my approach as I just got it working and the it works on my system caveat applies.
 Settings in ~/.emacs-profiles.el
  ("doom01" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/doom") (env . (("DOOMDIR" . "~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/config") ("DOOMPATH" . "~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/doom/bin") ("CHEMACS2PROFILE" . "doom01") )) )) 
 Command in $DOOMDIR/init.el
  (setenv "PATH" (concat (expand-file-name (getenv "DOOMPATH") "") ":" (getenv "PATH"))) 
 The setenv command in the Doom config's init.el sets the path to bin/doom in that profile and ~/.doom.d is automatically taken care of by DOOMDIR.
 With the $PATH variable including the path to the relevant bin\doom vterm and term inherit them automatically and the doom xxxx commands work as expected.
 The values in ~/.emacs-profiles.el and that command in init.el are the sole source of truth for mantaining that Doom installations. You don't need to set environment variables or paths anywhere else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Very long time emacs user here with a bunch of elisp under my belt - but this simple problem just eludes me.
 For years, I've done all my testing and running in a compile window.
 Emacs knows error messages that appear in that window, and I can use either M-x next-error to get to the error, or hit return on that line.
 This works pretty well flawlessly for me... but now I have a new tool and only a few of its errors get highlighted this way and I cannot see the difference!
 For example, in the run below, only the second error (fasteners.py) is highlighted and can be reached through next-error or carriage return: see https://imgur.com/a/I6P3egg
 -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: "/code/engora-search/" -*- Compilation started at Thu Sep 29 23:34:35 $ TERM=dumb d engora test --refurb engora/network/request/url_request.py:37:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/parser/fasteners.py:107:9 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/server/search.py:26:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/server/server.py:39:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` Run `refurb --explain ERR` to further explain an error. Use `--quiet` to silence this message 
 Why?
 My only theory was that fasteners.py:107:9 had three digits, the others two, but no: https://imgur.com/a/zgZ85M4 
 The output is already going through my own Python program, so I could easily rewrite it a bit without having to touch the refurb source - if I knew what was wrong.
  
Any ideas? This isn't a game blocker for me at all, but it's weirdly frustrating because I can't work it out. :-D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running Eglot or lsp-mode while working on remote files seems to be a common and rather problematic use-case, so I'm trying to understand why so many people need this.
 I have several projects where I can't or am not allowed to execute any code locally, and instead have a remote machine available for computations. But I've never encountered a project were I can't have the source code itself locally. So what I do is to edit the code locally and periodically sync it with the remote machine.
 The syncing part is admittedly a bit awkward, but there are ways to make it easier or mostly automatic. And then all Emacs features and external tools work fast and smoothly.

 This would happen every time; if I wait a day (and, so, have new E-mails come in) and then open Gnus again for the first time? All new E-mails marked as ancient.
 And then, recently, the E-mails just stopped showing.
 I'd already edited the Group's parameters to include (visible . t) and turned off scoring. I tried gnus-summary-show-all-threads and gnus-summary-limit-include-dormant (nothing happened and I was informed there were no dormant articles, respectively); I tried C-u M-g (I actually think this is what's causing the previous messages to not show up anymore, other than any which are still marked as new in my Inbox).
 I just want to display all messages and for their status to reflect what's on the E-mail server; if it's new there, Gnus should show new, etc. I'm not using any offline storing or anything, just nnimap. Is there any easy way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-mode for taking notes, mostly math and physics these days, typing LaTeX equations inside org files. For this I use doom emacs.
 I've seen that with markup markers such as "*" (bold) and "/" (italics), org-hide-emphasis-markers allows for showing the effect in the text while getting rid of the cumbersome markers. Moreover, when the point is within markers, they show so one can edit them.
 I was wondering if it is possible to do the same with LaTeX environments like "\begin{equation}" and "\end{equation}", for instance. I've tried with hide-lines.el, which allows for hiding lines matching a regex (in this case, the regex are, for instance: "^\\begin{[a-z]*}"). But although this works, it is far from ideal, as one would need to toggle their visibility for editing them, unlike the more practical way that org-emphasis-hide-markers allows for.
 Is there a way to achieve such result? Thanks in advance for all your help.
 Edit:
 To be clear, I would like to enter something like:
 \begin{equation}
 A = B
 \end{equation}
 and have emacs hide the first and third lines when away from the region, so that only
 A = B
 shows. If possible, I would also like to be able to see the delimiters whenever the point visits the A = B line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use to get Emacs for Mac OS X but now I just download the latest source tarball. I do:  ./configure --with-ns make make install sudo xattr -rds com.apple.quarantine nextstep/Emacs.app  and then move the app bundle to /Applications. But that's not what I'm here to talk about 😃
 When macOS switched to zsh I went through a painful transition. Before then, I had my ns-command-modifier set to meta so M-x would be cmd X for me. With bash, that was ok.
 But zsh opened new possibilities for me and it really wanted the meta on the options key rather than the command key. I honestly don't remember what the pain point was. But in any case, I remapped my emacs to be just the defaults where ns-option-modifier is set to meta and ns-command-modifier is set to super. zsh and emacs have a lot of common abilities so I wanted the key mappings to be the same in both. Rather than twist zsh to accept my unique setup I untwisted my unique emacs setup to be more normal.
 Now, I have an entire set of keys, the "super" keys that I've never had easy access to before.
 For example, using tabs in emacs, I can bind s-{ to tab-previous and s-} to tab-next and switch between tabs just like it was Safari. Instead of two key C-c p for Projectile, (they even suggest), one key s-p. I'm mapping s-r to projectile-rails, s-y to Yari, etc.
 It was and still is a bit painful of a transition but it is well worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I visit file foo.py, Emacs opens it in python-mode because the extension ".py" appears in auto-mode-alist This is true even if the file doesn't yet exist.
 However, if I simply create a new buffer called foo.py, using M-x switch-to-buffer, without tying it to a file, the new buffer is opened in fundamental-mode.
 Is there a way to set a new buffer's major mode based on its buffer name, rather than (or in addition to) its filename? I haven't found any hooks that would do the trick. Conversely, is there any reason why I don't want to do this?
 Thanks,
 (ETAA: this is slightly different from this question. That one is about setting the one mode to use in a new buffer. Mine is about calling a function to choose a mode dynamically. But that question seems to imply that there's no hook to do what I want.)

It was not easy to learn how put things away slowly, so that I‘ll be ready quickly when needed. Investing time now for time later. It means changing my personal workflow I‘ve trained over years.
And I‘m happy with the results. In the „Project Notes“ section of my Zettelkasten I now can find 73 smart sketchnotes I’ve already published here on LinkedIn, on Twitter or Instagram.
When did you start with your Zettelkasten? What‘s your learning experience?

We're writing to remind you that the OAuth out-of-band (OOB) flow will be deprecated on October 3, 2022, to protect your users from phishing and app impersonation attacks. [...] 
 If you have already migrated your app(s) to an alternative OAuth method, no further action is required. Please note that if your app(s) is natively installed you may have to request your users to update the app to the newer version to stop using the OOB method.
  
Their "more information" page: https://developers.googleblog.com/2022/02/making-oauth-flows-safer.html
 This leads me to this page for setting up oauth on desktop: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#redirect-uri_loopback and I must say that I don't understand at all what it is I'm supposed to do. 
 For reference, I looked at this similar reddit post from 4 months ago, but I don't know if this alternative oauth documentation was out yet: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/v3gfyp/continuing_with_orggcal_after_google_deprecates/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow emacsers. Running emacs28.2 (emacs-mac version Mituharu).
 I have observed many intermittent "hanging" of emacs on macOS for several months.
 This has not ever happened to me. At first it looked that I could trigger this feature when using mu4e, opening an html message and scrolling with an arrow downwards. This happened often but not immediately. Because I thought maybe this was mu4e related I chose to use a diffrent client (notmuch). Using notmuch the "hanging" did not happen. However, lately I noticed that the "hanging" could happen using consult-ripgrep searching a 2G sharepoint. And now also during just navigating between frames (on laptop and to screens).
 Q: what things could I do to get an idea what triggers emacs to hang? I do not mind recompiling emacs with special options if needed. Thank you, Marcel

 Python (ScalaPy) support has been gradually introduced in the last few releases, along with supporting Markdown (compiling and running Scala code in .md files) and Spark / Hadoop. You might also notice a lot of recent efforts focusing on improving backwards compatibility with scala/scalac. 
 For those who do not know it, Scala CLI is a command-line tool to interact with the Scala language. It's great for learning the language, writing scripts, prototyping and such.

 To have the right overview over the length of the current chapter, I wrote a function that counts the number of characters, starting from the outline-up-heading to the outline-forward-same-level, and divides them by 1.800 to give me a feeling for the number of pages the current chapter has.
 If I start the function in the last chapter, though, I get the error message "No following same-level heading". Of course, there is none, and I'd like to use point-max in this case. But how can I find out whether I'm in the last chapter, using elisp? Is there a way to find out whether there is a header of the same level following?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have org-roam set up on both personal and work machines. I've researched how people are using roam / roam-alikes but I am reluctant to get going with note-taking as:
 (1) It feels like a big overhead. I don't feel I have time for journalling / processing notes each day; 
 (2) I am concerned that the very beginning of my roam career is crucial to success, and I may develop bad habits or bad practices which will hold my Zettel back; and
 (3) I live on mobile, and roam workflows are not mobile friendly.
 I'd be interested in testing, by reflecting on the experience of others, the following assumptions I have:
 (a) that roam isn't necessary in a professional environment. I already subscribe to regularly-updated professional resources full of hyperlinks;
 (b) that roam doesn't replace my current org-mode setup of a GTD-like system (which I also struggle to review regularly). Rather it sits alongside it as a "reference" asset;
 (c) that the biggest use of org-roam for me would be in hobbies. For example if I wanted to make a video tutorial, or blog post;
 (d) roam isn't a place to store sensitive everyday information (like passport no, social security details etc); and
 (d) roam is not mobile friendly (I hear logseq works, but only for v1)

 The idea is to program a Windows service that will listen to a hotkey combination and perform some actions after that, for example, with selected text or some buffered data, and then put the result in the clipboard.
 Is it possible to program such service using only Haskell? Or maybe writing pure functions in dll to be called from some Windows-friendly language will be a better solution?

 ```hs (#>) :: Logger a -> (a -> Logger b) -> Logger b Logger la a #> f = let Logger lb b = f a in Logger (la++lb) b 
 compute :: Int -> Logger Int compute x = square x #> add #> double ```
 1) How does this let statement get used? Firstly it contains lb, which isn't passed to the #> function as a parameter, so where does it come from. Secondly, I understand something like let x = 5 in something, where the compiler looks for x in something and replaces it with 5. But in this case Logger lb b doesn't appear anywhere in the in expression, nor does a. So what is it replacing?
 2) How can the compute function call #> without proper parameters? I understand that functions can be partially applied (i.e. you don't pass the last parameter), but in this case we aren't even passing the first parameter - square is not a Logger. (UPDATE: This question is less important than 1) and there's more code for it in the comments, I don't want to make this too big)
 I don't understand this syntax at all.

 in a way this is a follow-up to my post before where paredit hindered ORG-HTML-EXPORT-TO-HTML.
 EDIT: Solved the first problem myself, now I've got another one, see EDIT below.
 I realized that not using PROG-MODE-HOOK for the activation of my PROGRAMMING-SETTINGS is detrimental to my programming workflow. So I wanted to keep the prog-mode stuff as it is and instead hook into the machinery behind org export. However, it seems to work differently, because when I use my "normal" workflow to work with hooks, it errors out, saying "wrong number of arguments".
 My normal workflow consists of defining a function that activates or de-activates stuff, and I call the function via ADD-HOOK. So far, I've not had problems with this workflow.

 ``` LSP :: The following servers support current file but do not have automatic installation: lsp-haskell You may find the installation instructions at https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages. (If you have already installed the server check lsp-log).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, just wondering if anyone has worked on any solutions to integrate some git commit message linting tools within magit.
 Can setup tools like Commitlint to add hooks that will reject a commit message if it is invalid, but if you format a commit message incorrectly it simply closes the commit buffer and returns to git status, meaning you have to retype out your commit message, which is obviously less than ideal.
 ​
 Has anyone looked at something like this before or have any suggestions about how to address this?
 Another potential solution is to possibly use a custom commit command that will open a shell in emacs and run something like cz-cli to create commit messages that adhere to things like the conventional commits format. 
 My search has yielded little results, so just wanted to ask others for anything I might be missing or some hints before I maybe start looking at implementing stuff myself :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I have this in my doom config init.el 
 (lsp +eglot +peek) 
 Basically, I've installed lsp-mode and eglot at the same time. The reason is that eglot works over TRAMP, while lsp-mode not. Also, I use a lot lsp-ltex and it depends directly of lsp-mode
 My question is: how could I disable eglot when using my local files and let that lsp-mode takes charge of everything, BUT reverse the roles when I'm in a remote file over TRAMP and shutdown lsp-mode and make eglot the lsp manager?
 Is it so hard to do or not? 
 Thanks.

 It makes things near unusable, unfortunately, and doesn't seem to matter which terminal I use.

 Consider that you are editing a plaint text file. If your editor is Kate, you can use both RET and C-RET (in Emacs parlance) to get two different results. For example, if your file is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been studying definitional interpreters written in Haskell as part of a programming languages course. We talked about writing in monadic style as an elegant way to implement non-determinism or exceptions or precise evaluation order. This got me wondering, is there a way to design an applicative interpreter which uses applicative functors as its interface?
 If this is possible, I could imagine a new design space. Since every monad gives rise to an applicative, there would be a broad range of applicatives to consider. Applicatives are also simpler to reason with, which could make the resulting languages more accessible for proofs.
 So far, I'm not sure that this is possible. Local 'let' definitions and lambda abstractions seem to require the full power of monads.

 I have an aesthetic issue the backlinks in my roam buffer are ugly (showing the full link in square brackets):
 ``` Backlinks (1) System Crafters (Top) They sometimes make videos about [[id:8ccffdbb-45c9-4826-b66a-182c085f6da7][programming languages]] like

 ```
 It seems from a Github issue that this may be because of org-descriptive-links, but I'm struggling to find information on that. It's not in the Org manual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/haskell community!
 For the context, in case you haven't seen my posts before: SimpleX Chat is the first messaging platform that has no user identifiers, not even random numbers The messages are e2e encrypted, and the servers and network observers cannot see users' contacts or groups. You can use the servers pre-configured in the apps or host your own.
 What's new in v4:
  
local database encryption with passphrase. It's using SQLCipher as a replacement of SQLite, via our forks of direct-sqlite/sqlite-simple, it worked very well on all platforms - iOS, Android, Linux, Mac, we only didn't manage to compile encryption for Windows yet.
 improved stability of chat groups, file transfers and message delivery.
 you can now use your own WebRTC ICE servers for audio-video calls.
 German language in the interface.
  
See full release announcement for more details.
 Download the apps via the links in our GitHub repo: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#readme.
 Please ask any questions
 You comments, questions and criticism here are very welcome - I will try to answer all the questions!
 Also, we are hosting the event on Discord on October 6, at 6pm UK / 10am PT - please join via this link to:
  
learn how SimpleX Chat is different and why it provides better meta-data privacy than alternatives,
 hear about future platform development plans,
 ask any questions,
 criticize what we do,
 suggest improvements.
  
Once you install the app you can choose "Connect to developers" to ask any questions, suggest new features and to join the group of users.
 About SimpleX Platform
 Some links to answer the most common questions:
 How can SimpleX deliver messages without user identifiers.
 What are the risks to have identifiers assigned to the users.
 Technical details and limitations.
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 After installing Emacs from package, my logs are full of warnings such as:
 Warning (comp): c: /tools/emacs/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/org/org-entities.el: Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Warning (comp): C: \\ ProgramData \\ chocolatey \\ lib \\ mingw \\ tools \\ install \\ mingw64 \\ bin \\ libgccjit-0.dll: error: error invoking gcc driver 
 I noticed that the problem is that emacs uses "global" gcc (installed by chocolatey) instead of the local gcc embedded in the installation directory. I don't have and don't need all emacs dependencies in my mingw main directories. Is it possible to somehow set the configuration so that it works only on "own" embedded compiler?
 So far, I have been able to work around the problem by removing mingw from the system env path, I write mainly in python and golang, but if I need it again, the problem will come back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The utility of uniqueness typing - as evidenced by it being separately adopted by Clean and Mercury, as well as having echoes in Rust - is straightforward: it enforces a typing discipline that ensures values only have a single reference. (or none, in the case of Rust) Hence, using them to model side-effecting sequential code is straightforward, as destructive update and imperative control in uniquely-typed code can't pollute what's outside.
 Linear types are more elegant and intuitive from an abstract perspective, but weaken that guarantee : a linear arrow in Haskell can mint a linear value out of an immutable "plain" value with multiple references. Hence, although no more references may be added once it's been created, in-place destructive update isn't guaranteed to be safe.
 All is not lost, though: as linear types can only be used once anyways, it would, for practical purposes, suffice to show that they are eventually unique - that, by the time of their use/destruction, they only have a single reference. One could also consider a sequence of linear arrow applications, such that it converges to uniqueness in the given reference to which they were applied.
 Are there meaningful assumptions which strengthen linearity to uniqueness without dropping the theoretical cleanness? (like wrapping them in an opaque monad)

 I need some help with lsp-diagnostics-mode and flycheck. Basically, the issue is that when I enable lsp-diagnostics-mode, flycheck doesn't work and I have to disable it (like screenshot below)

 Doesn't work
 If I just disable it works:

 Works
 ​
 Should it be like that? Or am I missing something?
 I'm a bit of a noob here, so any help is appreciated. Thanks

 UPDATE:
 I found out that the issue lies with python's jedi-language-server. If I use pyright this doesn't happen. It also works in elisp buffers, so that gave away that somehow jedi isn't working properly.
 For now, I'm going to be using pyright. One question though - is there a way to run several checkers at the same time? For instance, I would like to run flake8, pyright AND mypy.

 I'm a bit rusty on Nix so would love some help here :pray:
 Almost totally fresh M1 Pro Macbook Pro, just installed Nix and home-manager. I'm following the channel 22.05. Installed `ghc` fine, so I have 9.0.2, but when trying to install `haskell-language-server`, I get a segfault (exit code 139) when building Fourmolu which is a dependency. I get the same when trying to install Agda. Both happen whether through home-manager or not, and also whether from nixpkgs-unstable or 22.05. I suspect it's because Nix is for some reason using a really old version of clang (11) when it should be 13+ for M1s I believe.
 I can't believe I couldn't find this error anywhere no matter how…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I have recently started taking denote notes in org format, using code snippets where appropriate. 
 Ever since I started considering to build a personal blog out of these notes using lazyblorg, the capacity to export an org file to html has risen in importance. This was also the context in which I realized an org-babel/source block behaviour that I don't understand.
 Frequently, when I want to quickly test how a note looks in html, I run into the error "unmatched bracket or quote" which aborts the html export.
 Now, I've started to narrow the initial problem down to a few problematic aspects: apparently, org-babel tries to match "<>" and "' '", both of which I generally used. However, since the lisp-babel-block doesn't use any of those signs as delimiters, why can't I use them? 
 Find below a block of things that I'd like to, but can't, use:
 #+BEGIN_SRC lisp (defvar *my-list* '(a b c)) ; This doesn't work because of ' (second *my-list*) ;; => b ; This doesn't work because of > (mapcar #'list *my-list*) ; This doesn't work because of ' #+END_SRC 
 Now that I think of it, I also can't use either of these in regular text, which is pretty annoying. I would like to be able to use #' since it is something I'd want to explain to myself using a note.
 Is there a way that I can modify this behaviour?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just curious: If you've played around with several FP languages (especially typed), how do you think Scala compares with them? What is similar and what is different? 
 Some context: 
 I've been on a programming language exploration journey for the last year or so and I'm trying to learn as many FP languages as I can. I've looked into Haskell, the various Lisps/Schemes, F#, Ocaml, Elm, Rust, etc.... Racket (a Scheme) and the ML-based languages (F#, Ocaml) have been my favorites so far, though they're also not without their weaknesses. Racket and OCaml are both fantastic languages (I found myself favoring the latter due to the type system), but kinda suffer from having a relatively small ecosystem -- and in the case of Ocaml, rather poor tooling. F# offers a much better ecosystem, and in fact it's the language I've used the most (I love ADTs). There's also something very elegant about the ML syntax, even though F# lacks some of the more interesting features of OCaml. One non-trivial weakness of F#, imo, is that eventually you're going to have to resort to some (or sometimes a lot) non-FP/OOP code due to its ties with the C# and the .NET environment. And that can be a drag.
 I've also tried a little Clojure, and it's a nice enough language (happy not to have to deal with Java), though I can't say that I'm in love with it. Overall, it just seems like a less elegant Scheme, and I don't see much of a reason to use it over something like Racket/Scheme, except for maybe the larger collection of libraries that are available on the JVM (OK, the hot reloading feature is also neat, but not something I necessarily care about).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thank you for this amazing sub.
 I have a question on how to better make tests. I am still very new to Haskell and there are a lot of newbie things I still haven't grasped so please bear with me.
 Say I have a data type that represents an expression in a abstract syntax tree.
 ​
 data Express = Bin String Express Express | BoolLit Bool | NumLit Int | StrinLit String | Unita String Express 
 Now I could do something like
 import qualified Generic.Random as GR instance Arbitrary Express where 
 arbitrary = GR.genericArbitrary GR.uniform
 But then I will get a ton of examples that I don't care to check for.
 For example:
  Binary "+" (NumLit 3) (BoolLit True) 
 Ideally I would want to generate an arbitrary that only produces valid examples.
 I get this is where I have to do some work.
 I played around with 
 ​
 instance Arbitrary Express where arbitrary = sized exprArb where exprArb s = do frequency [ (1, do num <- arbitrary return $ (NumLit num) ), (1, do expr1 <- arbitrary expr2 <- arbitrary str <- vectorOf 1 $ Test.QuickCheck.elements ['+', '-', '*', '/'] return $ Bin str expr1 expr2 ........ 
 The issue with the above is now I am manually making this to only be `Bin` and `NumLit`
 ​
 I think the solution would be to make an type/alias for only Bin/NumLit, Bin/StringLit, Bin/Bool.
 Then make a `GR.genericArbitrary GR.uniform` out of those.
 ​
 Not sure how to do that. Or if that is even the right way.
 What is the best way to leverage QuickCheck to test this without changing `data Express` ?

The ability to change the functionality of the editor, and to fit your editor to your workflow rather than the other way around is amazing. But I've never really been fully in Emacs. There are certain tasks that I do in a web browser or in a separate tool, like email or image editing, etc. For some of these, one could easily argue that Emacs isn't an appropriate tool (image editing). However, there are other features that Emacs has that don't replace functionality I already have, but rather, augment your workflow with something entirely new. And I will admit, I most definitely have not explored those as thoroughly as I perhaps should have.

 I think I have followed one-too-many tutorials, and ended up with a non-working config, because my roam buffer doesn't show backlinks. I'm creating notes using org-roam-node-find or links SPC m l l or both.
 My buffer just shows one "backlink" which is persistent no matter which file I visit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've put together the first release (0.0.1) for echopraxia-plusakka, a structured logging module that adds structured logging mapping for Akka components -- Actor(Ref|Path|System|Context) etc -- and also adds some type enrichment and utility classes to expose loggers intuitively.
 https://github.com/tersesystems/echopraxia-plusakka
 Note that this doesn't go through LoggingAdapter, Akka's internal logging pipeline. Everything run through LoggingAdapter was processed into a String, so you couldn't represent data in two different formats depending on the appender -- in Echopraxia, argument serialization is deferred, so you can have logfmt on console and JSON on the backend. 
 This also means you don't have to rely on MDC or the built-in toString methods in Akka any more. Probably the biggest relief is being able to map ByteString to {length=11 utf8String=some string} so it has binary/text data available.
 Your domain messages in Akka can be handled using automatic derivation, and logging is type safe -- if there's no ToValue mapping, the logging statement just won't compile.
 Hope you like it!
 (Comments about Akka's business license / future are not welcome, please keep it on topic.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am a newbie in Haskell, but I want to use it to run some simulations for work.
 In particular, I am trying to write a function to compute the barycentric coordinates of a point and determine whether it is inside a triangle or not.
 Before anyone asks: it's not for rendering or game programming.
 I wrote the following code trying to translate my original C code:
 data Vec2D = Vec2D Double Double deriving (Show) data Triangle = Triangle Vec2D Vec2D Vec2D deriving(Show) v2c:: Vec2D -> (Double,Double) v2c (Vec2D x y) = (x,y) barycentric:: Vec2D -> Triangle -> (Double,Double,Double) barycentric (Vec2D xp yp) (Triangle a b c) = if db == 0 || dg == 0 then (-1,-1,-1) else (alpha,beta/db,gamma/dg) where (xp1,yp1) = v2c a (xp2,yp2) = v2c b (xp3,yp3) = v2c c dg = ((yp1 - yp2) * xp3 + (xp2 - xp1) * yp3 + xp1 * yp2 - xp2 * yp1) db = ((yp1 - yp3) * xp2 + (xp3 - xp1) * yp2 + xp1 * yp3 - xp3 * yp1) gamma = ((yp1 - yp2) * xp + (xp2 - xp1) * yp + xp1 * yp2 - xp2 * yp1)/dg beta = ((yp1 - yp3) * xp + (xp3 - xp1) * yp + xp1 * yp3 - xp3 * yp1)/db alpha = 1 - beta - gamma 
 The code compiles and, from my tests, it seems to work.
 As per the subject of the post:
  
How can I improve it?
 is the division by dg and db ok in the "where block" or should I be worried about a "divide by 0" error?
 Is there a better way to do this without having such a big "where block"?

 (getenv "HOST") returns a blank and it is annoying as my custom-file includes the USER and HOST variables so I can use the same configuration on different systems without clobbering the custom.el.
 Once Emacs fully loads it is available and (getenv "HOST") works fine.
 Is there some reason Emacs behaves this way for this particular variable?
 SOLVED
 I checked my .profile and realized that in this instance the config file which creates the HOST variable was not being source'd, so I've fixed it in this instance.
 The problem dates back some years ago when the default Debian environment was not creating a variable I needed so I had to add
 export HOST=$(hostname)
 to my .profile to ensure it would be available to GUI programs.

 I'm starting with early-init.el, and may add my own modules later, but I'm worried that when I update doom from the repo some of my settings will be overwritten.
 The logical thing to do it seems is to create my own branch of the original clone and make my own changes there. Then when I want to upgrade, I switch to the original master, pull the new changes, and cherry-pick the parts I need that don't conflict with my changes etc, but my git-fu is weak.
 Any experiences or advice in that respect? Are there some things to do or avoid that will make things easier?
 PS. I am also on the master branch which says 3.0.0-pre although the latest stable tag 2.0.9. Does that make much of a difference?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning! ☀️
 We're kicking off this week with new releases for both Indigo (Scala.js Game Engine) and Tyrian (Scala.js Elm-like Web Framework).
 It's been a while since we last pushed out new versions, but we're still working hard on both projects! The libraries are increasingly stable and we're having as much fun working with them as on them these days. 😊
 Indigo 0.14.0
 This release includes many improvements, fixes, and enhancements, but the exciting new feature is timeline animations!
 Even simple animations for title screens used to be very difficult in Indigo, but they now have a dedicated and rather fun solution.
 Release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.14.0
 (As a bonus, the Roguelike-starterkit has also had a tiny update to keep it inline with Indigo.)
 Tyrian 0.6.0
 Version 0.5.0 rebuilt Tyrian to run on Cats Effect 3 and fs2 from the ground up, but you were locked into using IO, and you couldn't use fs2 directly in your web apps. This release adds...
  
The ability to use fs2 Streams for subscriptions
 Support for ZIO 2.0*
  
We've also added a swathe of other quality-of-life improvements.
 Release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.6.0
 (\ You'll need to use a snapshot of the interop-cats library until the next release, but it works just fine. See the release notes.)*
 Getting Started
 You can get started with either project with their g8 templates:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian.g8
 ...or by heading over to the awesome: https://scribble.ninja/
 Documentation can be found at https://indigoengine.io/ and https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/.
 As always, please report any issues, and if you need any help, do come and say hello on Discord.

 Some experience with org mode, trying to bend code blocks to my will.
 Trying to use org to pass a json file into python script while developing it. I really would like to keep the json highlighting that org-mode provides. 
 If I were doing it in bash I might create the file as bash cat > /tmp/args.json <<HERE { "JSON_HERE": "Here is some JSON" } HERE 
 The python script will be written from a template and expects input from a file. If invoked at the command line, the command is python library/my\_test.py /tmp/args.json
 For the JSON part, I have JSON set up as an org-mode language language and that provides syntax highlighting and pop-out editing, but of course there is nothing to execute. An example block would almost do it, but there is no simple way to save that to a file AFAIK
 For the python part, there is lots of information in the manual as to how to pass in various elisp list, tables, properties etc but all I need is a simple file name. Any ideas how to do that without changing my code?
 Apologies if these are dumb questions.
 Cheers 
 Steven.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've stumbled upon this post by Jim Nielsen:
https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/markdown-sans-front-matter/
It describes how he went from Markdown files with metadata as YAML frontmatter:
---
title: My Blog Post
tags:
  - html
  - css
---

Start my blog post here.

... to just Markdown:
#html #css

# My Blog Post

Start my blog post here.

Jim's trick is to put the "slug" (i.e. the unique identifier that determines the URL of the published piece, which in the case of example.com/posts/my-amazing-post/ is the my-amazing-post part) into the filename. His filenames are of the format <YYYY-MM-DD>-<url-slug>.md, so starting with an ISO date, then the URL "path".
Making blogging simpler this way reminds me of how the way Sascha's and my Zettel format changed over the years, and how Sascha's very minimal solution eventually came about and sticks around since then:
# <ID> <TITLE>
<tags>

<content>

Very similar approach: make it pleasant for the human, let the app do the work. Avoid ceremony and technobabble.
I'd argue that Jim Nielsen's approach of putting hashtags before the title can worsen interoperability with applications that treat the first line of a file as the title -- but while that behavior is popular in a niche of plain text note-taking apps, it never really became a mainstream expectation, so 🤷‍♂️]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not like to set internal-border-with to anything other than 0, because I don't want the mode-line to not extend across the entire frame. So I've been looking for ways of adding a bit of 'padding' to my frame. 
 Left and right it's straightforward: simple set the fringe to some suitable width. Top padding is less so. 
 I figured I could make use of the header-line for that, and this seemed like a good start:
 (setq header-line-format " ") 
 Now, I found having a whole blank line of padding a bit much (I know...), so I tried specifying the height property in the value of header-line-format directly: 
 (setq header-line-format (propertize " " 'face '(:height 80))) 
 But that doesn't make a difference unless the height property is greater than that of header-line. 
 The only way I've found to make the header-line take up less than the default line height is by messing with the height of header-line. Unfortunately, some modes make use of the header-line for displaying stuff, so I find myself having to add hooks to every mode I encounter that does make use of the header-line, e.g.
 (defun my/reset-header-line-face () (face-remap-add-relative 'header-line '(:height 180))) (add-hook 'use-package-statistics-mode-hook 'my/reset-header-line-face) 
 Does anyone know or can think of a less ad-hoc solution?

 Also it's always saying "GHCup is not installed" when I clearly have it installed, can this be the problem?
 I am using EndeavourOS (basically Arch Linux) and my extensions are Haskell, Haskell HSX and Haskell Syntax Highlighting.
 In Windows 10 I have no problem using Haskell in VS Codium
 EDIT: Solved! I had to use the codium command to open VS Codium from the terminal. If you use normal VS Code just use code.This is not a direct fix to my issue but it's good enough for me, in the comments you can find the actual solution if you have patience to do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago i bought an expensive guitar. I played it for maybe 2 months and one of the strings started producing some ringing. The guitar came with a 5 year warranty. I took it to the shop, they tried to fix it but failed and offered me a new one. I readily accepted the exchange.
 A few months down the line even this guitar had some issues with ringing here and there. You'd be surprised to know that they again gave me a new one.
 Now, onto my third guitar. I started getting a bit better at playing by now (I had already been playing for years but didn't practice everyday until I invested in this guitar) and started understanding some technical details about the guitar, servicing it myself and also some just non technical things. I also saw the guitar Willie Nelson plays (it literally has a gouged hole in it and honestly most people who don't know it would chuck it in garbage).
 I realized that it's a guitar, it's made of wood and in a certain sense is alive. It's not going to be perfect but it's my Guitar. I know how to make it work. I practice on it everyday and I know how to manage those little details.
 You see where I'm going with this? I moved to Emacs a month ago. Objectively, it might be the worse choice compared to my setup on VSCode but it's my editor. Sure they'd be some jank and some small errors and bugs I can't fix but I can always service it myself. I can always make it better. I'd learn with it and grow with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are some the steps when trying to resolve errors from cabal build that fails because of dependencies not compiling? I'm not a seasoned user and lack experience with the build tools, but seem to encounter these build issues more often than I would like to. For example I currently have this error. Ok, so one transitive dependency (diagrams-lib-1.4.5.3) that will not compile because of variable not in scope. I then try to lower the version bounds for dependencies that depend on diagrams-lib-1.4.5.3 in hopes that a lower version will not have this same issue:
 Chart >=1.8 && <1.10 , Chart-diagrams >=1.8 && <1.10 
 To:
 Chart >=1.7.0 && <1.8 , Chart-diagrams >=1.7.0 && <1.8 
 This causes another compilation error which I don't understand, as I have already tried various version bounds. So now I don't have any ideas left.
 Why would transitive dependency not compile, shouldn't this be solved by the dependency that uses it before being uploaded as a library for general usage?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a way to export an existing results block?
 Let's say I have this file:
 ``` * An example
 +begin_src sh :results output
 curl -I google.com
 +end_src
 ```
 I evaluate that src block, so now my file looks like:
 ``` * An example
 +begin_src sh :results output
 curl -I google.com
 +end_src
 +RESULTS:
 +begin_example
 HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Location: http://www.google.com/ Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Date: Sun, 25 Sep 2022 16:22:36 GMT Expires: Tue, 25 Oct 2022 16:22:36 GMT Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000 Server: gws Content-Length: 219 X-XSS-Protection: 0 X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
 +end_example
 ```
 But when I export (to Markdown as an example here, but all export backends seem to behave the same way), I don't get the results block:
 ```
 Table of Contents
  
 An example
  
<a id="org6ad066a"></a>
 An example
 curl -I google.com 
 ```
 I know about :exports both, but that re-evaluates the src block on export to generate a new results block, which I don't want. In my case, I need to capture results at a point in time--which I do by manually evaluating the src block in the buffer. I then want to be able to export those existing point-in-time results to other formats. Is there a way to do this? Am I missing something simple here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is a topic which has popped up a few times recently...
 I'm curious if anyone has any advice on annotating non-Org/Org Roam documents -- mostly PDFs -- in a way that allows the annotations to be integrated with Org/Org Roam? There has been some chatter here recently about forking + updating org-noter and I'm monitoring that situation.
 Are there other options out there?
 Is it worth considering the option of having some other tool host the annotations and hooking into that via .el? So, for instance, if Calibre supported annotation (it does not) would it be a better approach to include annotation support in calibredb.el?
 Thoughts? Opinions?
 FWIW, I've been doing a ton of research lately and it would be so nice to be able to pull non-Org stuff into the reach of the Org and Org Roam ecosystem in terms of linking, excerpts, and search.

But I did notice that Modalka defines fewer keymaps than Boon does. Modalka only provides two modes for editing and everything else, while Boon provides more modes.
 So I suspect that really what's happening is that they are managing keymaps. Is this actually true? Or am I missing something important?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started trying out nnreddit, a Reddit backend for GNUS. Out of the box, an refresh take around 3 minutes.
 I peeked into the source code of nnreddit and it seems that most of the time it spent is just accept-process-output. This should play well with cooperative threading. So out of curiosity, I tried
 (make-thread (lambda () (gnus-group-get-new-news)) "Gnus Get News") 
 Guess what -- it works! It does the work in the background without blocking emacs, and update the *Group* buffer once it's done.
 Surprisingly I didn't find anything similar online. I wonder have anyone experimented similiar techiques with more heavy usage? I have no idea how robust this is -- I could be very lucky with nnreddit, its source code has a bunch of with-mutex. I guess that suggests it's written with concurrency in mind? But it doesn't really use any concurrency out of the box, really puzzling...
 P.S. I know the workaround of running multiple Emacsen, but I don't really like it, because I would no longer have one single Lisp image where interoperation between applications is as simple as a function call, or hacking into each other's variables...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I have
 ```
 +name: foo-overall
 +begin_src haskell :tangle foo.hs
 <<foo-a>> <<foo-b>>
 +end_src
 ```
 somewhere in my Org file and I have the definitions of these <<...>> noweb style references like this:
 ```
 +name: foo-a
 +begin_src haskell
 hello
 +end_src
 +name: foo-b
 +begin_src haskell
 world
 +end_src
 ```
 I would like to run org-html-export-to-html but make it so that:
  
each of the exported code blocks foo-a and foo-b link back to their location in foo-overall and
 foo-overall automatically links each of its <<foo-a>> and <<foo-b>> lines inside its code block to their respective definitions.
  
In other words, I would like these noweb style references to link to each other in both directions. This is so that after going to the definition of <<foo-a>> I want a link to click so that I can go back to the discussion for foo-overall and vice versa.
 AFAIK, #1 can be achieved by manually inserting Org refs (e.g. (ref:...) in the src block for foo-overall) as per https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html and then manually inserting a caption for the src blocks of <<foo-a>> and <<foo-b>>. However this is extremely tedious and is basically a deal-breaker for me.
 I've searched around for a solution for #2 and the closest thing I found was this comment. The script there just collects a list of all src blocks and inserts this list as a "References ..." note to every src block, which is too verbose. I see that there's a Stackoverflow question but it has gone unanswered.
 I can probably hack something together outside of elisp but was wondering if anyone had a similar desire to make noweb references automatically linked everywhere. Help?

Every day that I edit and save a file, create a backup for the file as it was before the edit.
 (I believe that is already how backup files work, correct?)
 Keep all the existent backup versions of the past 7 days.
 Keep one backup version per week of backup files older than 7 days.
 Keep one backup version per month of backup files older than 30 days.
 Keep one backup version per trimester of backup files older than 90 days.
  
Is there tool that does something similar? If not, what would be my first steps to try this? I didn't see anything in the Backup Files section of the manual that could help me with this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The default behaviour of org-store-link in an ordinary text file is to create a file: link with a search string, e.g. file:myfile.txt::Line 42. That doesn't suit me when creating links in certain cases so I added the following function to org-create-file-search-functions in order to instead get links like file:myfile.txt::42:
  (defun org-projectile-annotate-file-search-func () (when (and (projectile-project-p) (get-buffer-window "project-annotations.org")) (number-to-string (line-number-at-pos)))) 
 That works as expected, but then I read this bit in the documentation of org-create-file-search-functions
  
A function in this hook may also use setq to set the variable description to provide a suggestion for the descriptive text to be used for this link when it gets inserted into an Org buffer with org-insert-link.
  
I thought that might give me a way to make the description of the link a bit nicer (currently the description is the same as the link itself). However, I can't get it to work.
 I changed the function to
  (defun org-projectile-annotate-file-search-func () (when (and (projectile-project-p) (get-buffer-window "project-annotations.org")) (setq description "foobar") (number-to-string (line-number-at-pos)))) 
 but the link's description did not change. I then read the code for org-store-link and found no reference to description, but I did find desc so I did a setq on desc instead. Still no change to the link description.
 What is it I'm missing here? Or maybe the documentation is wrong?

 I’ve been working with Python for 3 years and I begun to explore the idea of learning a new language. I have done some projects at work using PySpark and I thought that going full blown Spark (i.e. learning Scala) would be a sensible option.
 However, I have no previous knowledge of Java and people also tend to be slightly negative about the idea of learning Scala for Spark since PySpark does a very similar thing… or so they say.
 My current job is a mixture of Python + databases… with a little bit of big data.
 What are you thoughts?
 Many thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello all.
 I've recently been using exwm and it's comfy, I like and dislike it's quirks.
 I have one question: is there any advantage on running exwm with a normal emacs client vs running emacs --daemon -f exwm-enable? I have sx configured that it launches dbus-run-session emacs and it works fine. but now I do this:
 s6-rc -l /tmp/${USER}/s6-rc -u change emacs-exwm
 while ! [ -e /run/user/1000/emacs/server ]
 do
 continue
 done
 exec dbus-launch /usr/bin/emacsclient -c
 where the first line it's just a supervised emacs --fg-daemon f exwm-enable.
 with this approach I can control emacs via kdeconnect (emacsclient --eval '(blabla)'), but is there any disadvantage?
 TL;DR when using exwm, is it better to use emacs with or without server-mode?

 I've configured emacs to use lsp-mode for several languages e.g. haskell when visiting a .hs file, python for a .py file. 
 These all work as expected according to my configuration.
 What happens often to me though is:
  
Open up such a file 
 lsp-mode fires up and connects (correctly) to the appropriate language server.
 
Edit other files of the same kind - all use the same languages server instance. Happy. 👍🏼
 
Kill the buffers using lsp-mode and connected to the languages server, one by one over time. 
 Close emacsclient (emacs server continues running as it should)
 
Language server is also still running despite having no more clients connected.
 
 Is it possible to have lsp-mode kill the language server automatically when there are no more clients?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[given 
 case class Box[A](a: A) def fun(string: Box[String]) = ??? val box: Box[Any] = ??? 
 find an elegant way to pass box to fun if it contains a String.
 in an ideal world we could have something like
 (boxes: Seq[Box[Any]])).collect { case box @ Box(_: String) => fun(box) } 
 but that won't work in reality
 (boxes: Seq[Box[Any]])).collect { case box @ Box(string: String) => fun(box.copy(a = string)) } 
 works, but it's a wart, and I think will result in an allocation
 (boxes: Seq[Box[Any]])).collect { case box @ Box(string: String) => fun(box.asInstanceOf[Box[String]) } 
 also works, but it's a wart and runs the risk that a future refactor gets the type in the cast different from the type in the pattern match

 I can see pros and cons for both but your experiences would be valuable

So, I've been writing linked notes for a few years now, and I've found some of the posts from this community to be particularly insightful, especially seeing behind-the-scenes of other people's processes. (I also adopted the idea of UIDs from this forum, which I use constantly).
While I've used my notes regularly for myself–during my work and for writing articles–I've never shared any of my notes directly. So, I recently decided to start posting some online straight from my editor – a place where I spend a decent part my day thinking and researching.
I always find it useful to see how other people record and connect their thinking, and I hope this might be interesting/helpful. I'll be adding to the collection on Twitter every couple of days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a function that exports all the tables in the subtree at point to a single CSV file. I tried to implement this by narrowing to the subtree at point and then applying org-table-map-tables:
 (defun sbr-org-export-subtree-tables () "Export the Org tables in subtree at point to TSV file." (interactive) (save-excursion (while (/= (org-current-level) 1) (org-up-heading-safe)) (let* ((table nil) (chapter (car (split-string (nth 4 (org-heading-components)) ":"))) (file (format "%s.csv" (replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" (downcase chapter))))) (org-narrow-to-subtree) (org-table-map-tables (lambda () (setq table (nconc table (cddr (org-table-to-lisp))))) t) (org-toggle-narrow-to-subtree) (with-temp-buffer (orgtbl-insert-elisp-table table) (beginning-of-buffer) (org-table-export file "orgtbl-to-tsv"))))) 
 I notice that this function is exporting all the tables in the buffer, not just the tables in the current subtree. It appears that org-table-map-tables is ignoring the narrowing of the buffer to the subtree. Is this a bug, or am I misunderstanding how org-table-map-tables is intended to be used?

 i've wanted to do hands free emacs for a while now but existing software like dragon naturally speaking, just didn't seem up for it. Is now the time? Could we design some kind of conlang (constructed language) to interact with emacs with? Would it be like the reverse version of how the blind use a computer (where the words blend together at a seemingly impossible speed for those untrained)?

 A monitoring program have been deployed in the ryu controller in order to capture the network traffic with two classes (normal and attack) .
 The monitored traffic has been saved in csv file and treated as a dataset in order to train a deep learning model for network traffic classification . 
 A One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) model has been developed using tensorflow and keras. The trained model was saved as h5 file . My question is how to deploy or integrate the h5 model and run it inside the ryu controller .. I have tried to do the tensorflow integration in different ways but unfortunately I failed as I faced many difficulties in installing tensorflow and its supporting libraries inside the ryu controller. I would be greatful If you have any suggestions that lead to sort out the aforementioned issue.

I know we have describe-key, describe-mode, and describe-keymap, but it seems as though those are the Emacs bound keys. This isn't too much of a concern as I can switch to Emacs control from evil, but I was wondering if there is a way to see the evil bindings easily so I wouldn't have to switch back and forth. 
 If someone can give me a clue or point me in the right direction that would be appreciated. My google-fu is failing me currently

 I uncommented Python and running doom doctor came up with some errors about some addons.
 > :lang python ! Couldn't find isort. Import sorting will not work. ! Couldn't find pipenv. pipenv support will not work. ! Couldn't find nosetests. Running tests through nose will not work. ! Couldn't find pytest. Running tests through pytest will not work. 
 I suspect running pip to install the necessary python and emacs packages will fix those.
 Until LSP and pyls are installed is Python support provided by flycheck or some package installed by default?
 A worry I have is to know if what Doom did used Python 2 or Python 3 as both are installed on my system. I also saw some pip messages and perhaps that also involves Python 2
 Is that something I need to worry about now, or can that be deferred till later?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in desperate need right now. I'm taking a class at uni as a senior that focuses on a few different languages that are not in the degree track as much. To be specific. Haskell, Python, and Java. Python and Java I have no problem with. But for some reason, I cannot wrap my head around Haskell. I have tried everything. This class is a requirement for my degree and only one person teaches it. I've done well in my other classes and am familiar with a lot of other languages and I feel like I am about to throw tens of thousands of dollars away on a degree because I am struggling with one niche language that I never want to use again. I passed all the hard classes in my degree and my entire education hangs on this. No offense to people who love Haskell. I understand it can be a great language in certain uses. Anyone who was like a lost puppy when they started learning Haskell, what resources did you use? My degree, financial well-being, and mental health depend on it. Haskell is worth about 25% of the overall course grade and I already bombed the first assignment. Unfortunately, her questions are very hard and the homework is very strict on using resources and other people.
 She low key expects us to be fluent in haskell in just five weeks.
 I hope this post is okay here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that I have tamed end of line comments to line up with proportional fonts (using the display attribute :halign-to, which lets you make text display at a particular physical column), I'm wondering if I might be able to do the same for c++ lines which are indented because of being continuations of a statement for a previous line.
 This isn't such a big deal as the comment thing was, as it only affects continued lines, and looks OK anyway the way it is. But it would be nice - normally emacs will line things like an argument on a continuation line with the enclosing parenthesis from the function call, but with a proportional font it only ends up approximating that.
 ​
 It seems like what I would have to do, is in the code that calculates what character from the line above to line this line up with, calculate the physical position of that character and add the spaces, but also visually indent the next line using :halign-to.

 I saw that the clangd integration was available, so I turned it on, and I opened one of my normal project files.
 Why is clangd integration in VSCode so much faster and less painless? It came up with completions right away. I didn't have huge stalls while I waited for things to happen?
 I can only guess that something is weird with my setup, so I have to get rid of everything and start over, I think. I'll start with basically nothing except keybindings and eglot and p4.el and see if it's any better, because right now this is insupportable. The clangd integration in VSCode is faster than any code completion in Visual Studio or Jetbrains Rider, even with indexing turned on. I'd thought my stalls were because of clangd itself, and the absurd number of files it had indexed, but it's really not. I don't get symbol lookout timeouts in VS Code. There's something else afoot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 For experimentation purposes I would like to compile lucid-emacs for alpine.
 I can't even find the lucid-emacs source code if such a thing exists. The github mirror for emacs is here.
 The original GNU emacs repo is here.
 I have found this page for emacs-lucid here which I am not so sure.
 So to sum up:
  
Does emacs-lucid have its own repo?
 Is it possible to compile it for alpine?

 To make my use of Mu4e an even better experience, I would love to combine for autocompletion the mail-addresses of org-contacts with the automatically collected mail-adresses of the mu database. I am using helm and tried out John Kitchins solution from https://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/03/14/A-helm-mu4e-contact-selector/, but if I (require 'org-contacts), the variable mu4e~contacts-for-completion is void, and if I do not (require 'org-contacts), I get the error: Symbonl's function definition is void: org-contacts-db.
 Does anyone of you combine the two sources for e-mail-address completion in mu4e, and how have you solved it?
 I was setting hopes in mu4e-contacts (https://gitlab.com/voidyourwarranty/mu4e-contacts). Regrettably, when I add the package and restart emacs, I get (error Recursive ‘require’ for feature ‘mu4e’).
 Thank you for any help and insights!
 I am using mu4e 1.8.9 and the newest version of org-contacts (that is on melpa again, yeah!).

 I've got an application that appears to get slower over time. I currently have no idea why. Ram usage seems constant, CPU usage seems low. But after a while, requests to the API take longer and longer.
 The problem is that I have no idea how to start working out where the performance issues are. It can take days before the problem sets in.
 Are there any good ways of getting to the bottom of this? Any tricks to facilitate debugging? I know that the RTS can spit out all sorts of logs, but I have no idea about interpreting them, or even if it's a good idea to log for days before stopping.
 So is there any good guides/tools for tackling this kind of problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellows,
 I am a recent denote convert and love it. It is an enriching expierience to have the ability to link notes to another (I have not used org-roam or exhausted hyperbole's capabilities). In my current workflow, I have bound org-store-link within my denote straight-use-package declaration because that's where I define other denote-related key-bindings and org-store-link has a denote: interface.
 When using that within a note created by denote itself, it works like a charm: I can just use the denote: type of link, a minibuffer selection is opened that shows the contents of my denote-directory.
 I tried to do the same in my todos.org file: org-store-link, denote: to link to a specific note. That did not work. After choosing the denote: type, I would have to manually enter the denote id, without completion and without minibuffer selection.
 I have no clue why that happens. Do you have an idea or a solution to this?
 Thanks a bunch, have a good day :)

 There are two things:
  
#1 ssh into Head Node. The cluster has login node but then I have to queue up for a node to do a big run. Then, I have to ssh into the (non-login) head node once slurm runs that. So, can I do this 'double ssh' using emac's gdb?
  load modules. gdb is on the cluster but a module needs to be loaded.
  
Is all this possible? It seems non trivial to do

 the Thompson book makes heavy use of GHCi. I do all my studying on my galaxy tab s6 lite tablet, so I don't have to lug around a laptop to the library and coffeeshops.
 is it possible to install ghci (including writing module files and loading them) on my android tablet? a quick Google search on this subreddit and Google, of [ghci Android], makes me think that I can't?

The materialized versions can then be incrementally maintained, i.e., you provide inserts and deletions for the data sources processed by a dataflow graph and idf will update the results of the dataflow based on the changes to the input data sources (what elements got inserted and deleted from the data sources).

 In particular I'm trying to export tables, so I need to build table, table-row and table-cell functionality.
 However, I'm not sure what the best way to interactively explore the functions and their arguments. To run my function I (naturally) open my sample org file and M-x myfunc RET. Currently I'm using (message ...)-type lines, but printing values doesn't feel very lispy.
 Is there a better way to develop these sort of backends/interactive functions using the REPL functionality of ielm (or something else?)

Now, if you run nix-shell, you’ll be given a shell with Rust, Cargo, and Cargo Flamegraph available to you.
That’s pretty neat, but what if you want to take it a step further, and use Nix to package your Rust code?
There are many options available, with different trade offs, and it can be quite overwhelming to choose between them, although there is some information on the NixOS Wiki.

 data Expre = A | B | X Expre Expre process :: Expre -> Expre process A = B process B = A process (X ex1 ex2) = X (process ex1) (process ex2) 
 Expre pretty much represents a tree with two leaf constructors.
 process has my rewrite rules for terms of type Expre. All it does is swap A and B around. I was wondering if there is a canonical, clean way to track each application of a rewrite rule? So, concretely tracking the changes of my expression: process $ X A (X B A) should spit out the following list of intermediate terms:
 1 X B (X B A) 2 X B (X A A) 1 X B (X A B) 
 The number in the front represents which rewrite rule was applied. This feels very much like a problem that has a generic solution using a typeclass/data structure/idea that I'm not aware of, so I was wondering if such a thing exists. 
 My handrolled solution looks like this, there has to be a neater way:
 process :: (Expre -> Expre) -> Expre -> Writer [(Int, Expre)] Expre process fn A = tell [(1, fn B)] >> return B process fn B = tell [(2, fn A)] >> return A process fn (X ex1 ex2) = do e1 <- process (\e -> fn $ X e ex2) ex1 e2 <- process (\e -> fn $ X e1 e) ex2 return $ X e1 e2 
 Called with runWriter $ process id $ X A (X B A) in GHC gives the desired result.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody! I'm really having a hard time trying to decide whether to learn vim or emacs. I'm not here to ask for suggestion or any kind of comparison between the two, don't worry. What I'd like to know is whether org-mode could be useful for a specific use case, which could make me lean towards doom emacs rather than neovim.
 From time to time I have to write documentation for software packages at work. While doing so, we like to have both a pdf version (using latex) to hand to our customers and an html (or similar) version to be stored inside the git repository of the project. To avoid having to write two different docs, we initially used markdown and a custom pandoc filter (for headings, frontpages and whatnot). The problem is that this approach is very limiting when it comes to cross-referencing, captions, and tables with cells spanning multiple columns or rows. Hence we switched to RMarkdown, but having to write R code for the sole purpose of properly handling a few images and tables is very frustrating.
 Do you think that org-mode could be used to solve the problem once and for all? I know that tables in org-mode are pretty powerful, but I don't know to which extent. Nor if the same syntax would be correctly translated both in latex and html as it is with simpler tables.
 Also, if any of you uses org-mode to write scientific papers (hence using different latex templates from different journals) in the STEMs, I'd like to hear your impressions.

 ​
 I would like to write a parser for these sorts of problems on Hackerrank.
 https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/json-parsing-from-scratch-in-haskell/
 When I find a guide on how to write a parser in Haskell...
 They always feel... a little impenetrable...
 i would likes my first parser, I would like to be able to write a complete Haskell program to parse the language
 Nat := succ(Nat) | 0 
 for example
 0 succ(0) succ(succ(succ(0))) 
 and I would like to parse them into a data type defined as
 data Nat = Succ Nat | Zero 
 I feel a little lost and I would just like to get an entry point. 
 Where do I start?
 Thank you!

 I'm an evil-mode user and I heavily rely on :s/ to search and replace in a specific buffer interactively. I appreciate vim Regex style and the fact this is showing me the selection in real-time.
 However, when trying to do a search and replace project-wise, I'm often a bit lost. I'm aware of projectile-replace-regexp but this only works with Emacs style Regex (And cannot be changed AFAIK) and It's not showing the matches in real-time.
 I couldn't find a good way of making changes in the whole project using vim bindings in Emacs (Using projectile or not). Any idea on how to achieve this?
 Thank you for any help / recommendations to fix my workflow!

 I have a minor thing that is driving me crazy.
 I want to set emacsclient -t -a emacs -nw as $EDITOR, so programs like git commit use emacs.
 So, what I am trying is setting export EDITOR='emacsclient -t -a emacs -nw' in my ~/.zshrc.
 When I run $EDITOR it says zsh: command not found: emacsclient -t -a emacs -nw.
 I also tried export EDITOR="emacsclient -t -a emacs -nw" and export EDITOR=emacsclient -t -a emacs -nw.
 The first one has the same result, the second one treads -t like a command
 / It's a bit weird, because this is how it's recommended in the wiki: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsClient Maybe a problem with zsh? // yup looks like it, because this works in bash.

 I'm a newb with emacs and org mode. I've been trying to get something into the agenda view with org-agenda-custom-commands and org-super-agenda-groups but been failing miserably :D
 What I want is pretty simple and I'm sure there's a solution this, but I wasn't able to find it.Basically, I want to list all TODO items under a certain heading. For instance:
 * Tasks ** TODO some stuff ** TODO some other stuff ** non todo stuff * Not tasks ** some non task stuff ** TODO Some todo, but not under Tasks heading 
 Now, what I would like to list in an agenda view is all TODO items under the "Tasks" heading, but not under the "Not tasks" heading. After running the custom command, it should be like this:
 ** TODO some stuff ** TODO some other stuff 
 I've been trying to get this to work with the search command, but could not get this to work. I'm a bit at a loss right now, so any help, would be really appreciated :)

 My assumption with LSP is that all heavy lifting should be done by the language server. Why does Eglot + terraform-ls not work as well as VSCode's implementation? Not even some basic auto-completion. Anyone managed to get it working?

 ​
 I am working remotely on a supercomputing cluster, running Emacs on my machine, and using TRAMP to edit python files on the cluster.
 To my great surprise, this works quite well, and the REPL also works flawlessly, as apparently run-python (C-c C-p) detects this is a remote file, and use the corresponding interpreter on the remote.
 ​
 However, I realized the version of Python running on the cluster is not the correct one. Indeed, they use the module utility to provide multiple conflicting version of programs. This means that I have to run module load python3 before executing python3 to make sure I have the latest version.
 ​
 If I SSH into the cluster, this is not a problem, as I just added the module load line in my .bashrc. However here, I am not sure how to do it: this is not an interactive shell, so the usual dotfiles are not read (.bashrc, .profile and friends).
 ​
 Any idea ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm currently trying to build a small package org-inline-block that aims to provide a simple syntax for blocks (without begin/end) based on indentation (like plain lists). While it would be cleaner to properly extend org-element for the export part, I only plan to add a function to 'org-export-filter-body-functions.
 Here comes the function (simplified version that isolates the problem):
 (defun org-latex-inline-block (text backend info) "Manage inline block in LaTeX export, as part of body." (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex) (let ((case-fold-search nil)) (replace-regexp-in-string "\\([ \t]*\\)\\(\\(Question\\)\\( (\\([^()]*\\))\\)?\\.\\)\\(\\(.*$\\)\\([\n]\\(\\1[\t ]+.*\\)?\\)*\\)" (lambda (substr) (format "\\begin{question}%s\\end{question}" (org-inline-block-get-core substr))) text nil t)))) 
 with
 (defun org-inline-block-get-core (s) "Given >Question. abcde<, return >abcde<" (let ((case-fold-search nil)) (string-match "Question\\( ([^()]*)\\)?\\. " s) (if (> (match-end 0) 0) (substring s (match-end 0)) ""))) 
 Here comes the unexpected behavior: if I try to export "Question. Where is Brian?", it will be exported to "\begin{question} Where is Brian? \end{question} Where is Brian? ", and I can't guess where this duplicate comes from... Any idea ?

 I did the following:

 appendToEach n [] = []
 appendToEach (n) (x:xs) = foldr (:) (x++n) (appendToEach xs n)

 Are these techniques useful in FP? Are there other, more helpful techniques?
 I'm not too new at Haskell, and want to make a toy library to apply some concepts from university (math) while practising my knowledge (eg type families).
 I'm unsure how you can properly and critically design a project in a language such as Haskell.
 Any and all resources and advice is welcome, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Is it possible to perform an AST re-write that depends on global knowledge derived from the AST while simultaneously evaluating the AST -- all in a single pass?
 The "Real" Problem:
 I'm working on a Haskell -> Elm code generator. I'm parsing out an Elm type AST (see below). The problem is that multiple TyDecl varname nodes could exist after parsing. E.g: the following haskell type definition
 data Foo = Foo Int | Bar [Foo] 
 generates
 TyDecl "Foo" [] ( TyVariant ( ( "Foo" , [ TyInt ] ) :| [ ( "Bar" , [ TyApp "List" [ TyDecl "Foo" [] (!!! Recursive def of Foo here !!!) ( TyApp "Foo" [] )] ] ) ] ) ) ( TyApp "Foo" [] ) 
 To solve this problem I am folding twice over the parsed AST.
 The first pass replaces all but one TyDecl "Foo" node with its TyApp "Foo" [] node. This is done by using an algebra
 preventDuplicats :: (MonadState (Set VarName) m) => Base Ty (m a) -> m a 
 Following the example above this rewrites the above AST to be:
 TyDecl "Foo" [] ( TyVariant ( ( "Foo" , [ TyInt ] ) :| [ ( "Bar" , [ TyApp "List" [ TyApp "Foo" [] ] ] ) ] ) ) ( TyApp "Foo" [] ) 
 The second pass evaluates the AST to generate the Elm code (essentially):
 generateElm :: Base Ty String -> String 
 What I'd like to do is construct some mechanism that would let me perform this AST re-write (preventDuplicates) while evaluating with the main algebra (generateElm). Maybe something like?:
 evalAndPrevent :: (MonadState (Set VarName) m, Comonad w) => (Base Ty (w a) -> a) -> Base Ty (w (m a)) -> m a 
 Ty Definition
 data Ty = TyVar VarName | TyApp VarName [Ty] -- This models `let` expressions in type declarations -- data B a b c = <a> in <b> == TyDecl "B" ["a","b","c"] <a> <b> | TyDecl VarName [VarName] Ty Ty | ... deriving (Show, Generic) 
 Attempted solutions?
 I've looked into prepomorphisms. However, this doesn't seem to work because the re-write morphism Base t a -> Base t a by defintion is a "local" only re-write.

 I like how lightweight org-super-links feels and the fact that the links are just standard or links that work in orgzly. Honestly I can't figure out what org-roam adds to the picture. That said there seems to be a bunch of hype about org-roam and feel like I must be missing something. 
 Honest question: can someone explain the attraction of org-roam over org-super-links? Is there something special about the org-roam-capture stuff that's different enough from org-capture to fill some gaps?

The additional use grant in the BSL license for the Play Framework is very limited and is no solution to move forward. 
 It would be the best for these FOSS projects to have a reliable Akka fork (focused on bug fixing and long term stability).
 Are there already ongoing initiatives for an Akka fork?
 Who would be willing to contribute to an Akka fork (financial contribution, development or organisational aspects)?
 How do we make this happen?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, I made a post about Okapi. Okapi is a micro web framework for Haskell. The feedback I got was great and I've made a lot of changes to Okapi since then. The core idea of Okapi is still the same: use monadic parsing to implement web servers.
 The biggest addition to Okapi since I last posted is the addition of named routes. One of the comments on my previous post asked if Okapi had named routes. At the time it didn't, but I think I've found a way to implement type safe named routes in Okapi without relying on Template Haskell or type-level programming like other Haskell web frameworks do.
 I've written a series of essays on the topic of named routes, and how they work in Okapi.
  
Named Routes in Okapi: Part I
 Named Routes in Okapi: Part II
 Named Routes in Okapi: Part III
  
Okapi is still in the early stages of development, so I'm looking for feedback. Any kind of feedback is appreciated. Whether it's the design of the documentation, code conventions, the names of functions, concerns, etc. Please don't hesitate.
 I'm really interested to hear what non-Haskell users and beginner Haskellers have to say. The blog posts I listed above are probably more geared toward advanced-beginner/intermediate Haskellers, but feel free to check out the hopefully more beginner friendly documentation listed below.
  
Official documentation
 Hackage candidate documentation
  
Documentation is still largely incomplete at this point, but I'm working on it. I want to get feedback on everything so far before going further.
 I can't recommend Okapi for production projects yet, but I've successfully been using it for small, long-running web applications of only a few users without any problems so far.
 Thank you for reading :)

 It happens regardless of where I am on the individual text of the todo (keyword, text of it,...) or where I am in the list. My workaround has just been 'm'ing each entry individually, but it'd be great if I could get the mark all command to work.
 Is there something I'm missing? Do any other doom users have this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have heard that thrown around so many times that it was one of those sentences that didn't mean much anymore. Before I started using emacs I thought wtf does that even mean? I don't care what else it can do. I have everything else exactly how I want it, I just need a text editor. 
 For whatever reason, I made the switch from VSCode to Doom Emacs about 20 days ago. I knew vim keybindings and stuff already but I didn't use them on a day-to-day basis only on servers that didn't have anything else. I did pick up the evil keybindings quickly and after 2-3 days of installation and setup woes, my javascript editing environment was set up rather well. I started relying on vim-fu for code editing and it's so much more enjoyable (don't know if it's faster yet) than using a mouse. 
 That made me want more modal-based stuff, I wanted my browser to have modal navigation. While I'd never switch to the emacs browser I installed vimium on my chrome and it works rather well. Now, I started thinking it'd be so nice to have a file manager that was keyboard-focused and da-dum-tusss, the penny dropped. Dired, so that's what they mean when they say "Emacs is not just a text editor." 
 I'm in the process of installing mu4e now and I'm slowly beginning to understand things about Emacs that just cannot make sense to you unless you've spent some time with it. I know I heard people say that but I always thought of them as denial-filled ramblings of people who have sunk a decade into learning a tool that's slowly fading. Apparently, not the case at all.

like head were sometimes running in linear time instead of constant time.
What do I mean by “sometimes”? Well, to answer that, we need some familiarity with contract application and lazy evaluation.

Contracts are a key feature of Nickel that empowers you to write correct configurations in a flexible way

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title may be confusing so let me clarify. I often use a simple tool called sops made by Mozilla that is used to encrypt/decrypt yaml/json/text files with your gpg key. It works from the command line so if you invoke sops on and encrypted file it will decrypt it, open the decrypted version on a temp file (located in /tmp/<random-digits>) on your $EDITOR and then re-encrypt everything and delete the temp file once you close the $EDITOR.
 Currently I invoke sops on vterm which opens an new emacsclient instance where I edit my file. I thought wouldn't it be cool if emacs could auto recognize if a file is encrypted with sops and decrypt it on the same buffer. 
 Now the only thing I am having a hard time understanding is how you would go about redirecting sops to open a new buffer instead of whatever your $EDITOR is.

 Changes since v2.7.5:
 Behavior changes:
  
stack build --coverage will generate a unified coverage report, even if there is only one *.tix file, in case a package has tested the library of another package that has not tested its own library. See #5713
 stack --verbose no longer includes the lengthy raw snapshot layer (rsl) in the debug output by default. The new stack --[no-]rsl-in-log flag enables or disables the inclusion of the rsl in the debug output.
  
Other enhancements:
  
Bump to Hpack 0.35.0.
 On Windows, the installer now sets DisplayVersion in the registry, enabling tools like winget to properly read the version number.

  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages"))) 
 If I run package-refresh-contents it says "Failed to download elpa archive"
 Elpa seems to be up and running. I can visit that domain via web browser. And running emacs with emacs -q I can use package-install normally. So I have no clue what's going on.
 There are no error running package-refresh-contents using emacs -q.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently I'm using fancy-dabbrev and quite like it's behavior (aside from an issue with macros).
 For anyone who hasn't used it - it can preview completion while typing, pressing TAB can execute the completion or indent - based on the context.
  
While this works well sometimes I'd like to use completion besides dabbrev, configurable based on the context (editing code/comments/strings ... etc).
 Ideally there would be a way to use context sensitive compilation back-ends which I could write & register.
 At this point I'm considering writing my own package but thought there might be some solutions out there.
 Key features I'm looking for:
  
Preview completion while typing.
 Ability to define my own completion functions.
 Non-blocking interface, a single keystroke to accept and keep typing.
  
Does anything like this already exist?

 I see the "Haskell Language Server" alone is using 500MB. If my pc gets overloaded I have to kill Firefox and Code, but I see the language server is still going! 
 So 1) is a new HLS started for every editor I open, and every time I run GHCI, or is it all the same one? 2) how do I make it stop when I close my editor??

Headings and content are displayed indented, even though there is no leading whitespace on the line.
 When editing a code block, leading whitespace is added to the new line and sometimes the entire code block has leading whitespace added to it.
  
I would like to keep the first feature (which I think is provided by evil-auto-indent). I would like to disable the second feature, which I could not figure out with much experimentation and googling.
 Of specific interest is the org-indent-mode setting, which when set to t seems to be the feature that provides feature 1. But what is providing feature 2? I've tried playing with org-adapt-indentation but I'm not sure if I should be setting it as (set…]]></summary>

 However, since I startet using spacebar

 I don't have the possibility to see this information unless I switch to the emacs window/space.
 Spacebar can display the shell output of some commands. For example, `which`.
 I wonder if I could somehow display the clocking information in spacebar by using some system command outside emacs.
 ​
 Any ideas?
 EDIT
 After applying the solution proposed by @tianshuwang, I could have what I need.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I've been writing some go code recently, and found that the eglot/company mode autocomplete performance is awful with large completion lists. Specifically, I'm running into issues when using tcell. Here's an example snippet to show what I mean:
 package main import ( "github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2" ) func main() { tcell.[cursor goes here - `completion-at-point`] } 
 If completion-at-point is run at the position noted above, emacs locks up for several seconds. Based on a profiler report I ran, the lock up appears to happen at common-lisp-indent-function, but I can't find any evidence online that this is an expensive or slow function... I'm a little bit at a loss at how to fix this. Ideally I'd like to just disable indenting around whatever's happening here (since it's happening somewhere deep in the json rpc call). Can anyone else reproduce this problem, or has anyone else seen it?
 Edit: figured I'd mention that this problem disappears with lsp-mode, so I guess I'll be using that for the time being.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slick 3.4.0 was released and published to Maven Central, with 281 merged pull requests, many from the community. A pull request that could cause issues was then rolled back, so 3.4.1 was released as a hotfix.
 The latest docs are at https://scala-slick.org/doc/stable/.
 How to upgrade
 Upgrading should just be a matter of setting the version to 3.4.1 in your build files. (Or, give Scala Update a try.) However, see the upgrade guide in case any changes do affect you.
 What’s ahead
 Now that 3.4.1 has been released, the top priority is Scala 3 support, G-d willing. There is already a proof of concept by Stefan Zeiger (the original author of Slick), but there is still work to be done to ready it for consumption.
 After that is released, I would like to see Slick evolve freely. There are lots …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Longtime (30+ years) emacs user but not using it the way most folks do. I do ASIC design so my code is mostly SystemVerilog with some Python, makefiles, and shell scripts. I don’t use git, either - instead a rare tool called SOS (https://www.cliosoft.com/products/sos/) designed to integrate with CAE tools. Therefore, lots of packages like company don’t easily work with our setup. Instead, I have Verilog compile lists of files and include directories for a project. 
 Does any know of any project packages that could easily take the compile list files and give us the great features I’m always reading about here? LSP would be amazing since my verification files import many SystemVerilog packages of functions and classes (similar to those in other languages). 
 Thanks much!

 If so, why the naming inconsistency? Legacy of an expansion to org-babel at some point?
 Is there a difference that's relevant outside of org-babel's code but largely irrelevant inside it?
 Are 'header arguments' supposed to be the keys and 'parameters' the values, respectively? And the way they're handled (eg. org-babel-params-from-properties) is just making me go cross-eyed about an otherwise simple relationship? Or no?
 I don't /see/ a clearcut difference, but I don't entirely trust my eyes when it comes to org's source and could use a sanity check.

 Main changes:
 - cathed and fixed two cases where the behavior of async versions of stdlib functions was different than in direct mode. 
 - Experimental loom support (should be enabled by flag), which supports two modes:
 -- hybrid, where we use cps-transform for async/await and Loom for restoring a form of transformed high-order function arguments. This is useful for the effect systems, were spawning a virtual thread in each interpreter step will still be heavy compared to a function call. 
 -- full, where we use loom instead cps-transform.

For instance, I could write REGION to accept empty patterns for indefinite integrals, or to accept just a subscript for regions, similarly for DIFFERENTIAL or INTEGRAND. Instead, in Calc, I have to write a messy rewrite rule to just handle the REGION part, and I am not even sure if the INTEGRAND symbol could be implemented since any integrand having terms that look like $\frac{d f}{d x}$ would prematurely terminate parsing as the denominator would be interpreted as DIFFERENTIAL. It seems to me that Calc is formally incapable of handling these complications, but I may be wrong. Are there ways within calc to implemen the functinality I want? If not, are there libraries that allow me to augment Calc in this way? Failing that, I would be willing to use the Wisent parser generator, but how do I integrate it into Calc?

Use SPC p d to delete the added project myproject under folder1 path, then add it under another path /Users/me/folder2/myproject. It can be shown as /Users/me/folder2/myproject in the SPC p p list. However, if select the new myproject in the new folder. It opened in the old folder folder1 again.
 So it seems it's using cache to fetch the same project name even under different path.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a way to increase the line height globally, so that if font fallback chooses a taller font, it doesn't shift the rest of the text downwards?
 My use case is that if I add Chinese text for any reason, the fallback font Noto Sans CJK is slightly taller than my coding font Iosevka which causes every line to shift down.
 Before anyone suggests this, changing line spacing does not address my issue.
 Luckily I probably can work around this by compiling the font with additional vertical spacing myself, but I'd rather just not have to do that every time the font updates.

 However, I still don’t understand for what and how Scala is used in the corporate world. So, I’d love to hear some suggestions for Scala projects similar to the real world, where I can dive more in depth in the language and possibly apply for a job. 
 Thank you very much. 😄

Maybe I haven't run across the right tutorial, but my impression is that it is a fancy outline maker. Half of the positive things people say about Emacs seem to be about org-mode, but everyone seems to use it in different ways, for different things. Ironically, org-mode is daunting in its breadth the same way that Emacs itself must be for new users. Are there good resources that can explain the philosophy and applications of org-mode?
