 I am a noob to emacs and a long-time Ach user(btw)!
 I mainly programme in python and need to get my head around how to have on the fly comments for errors in my code. Some of the info on the net seems old, like the need to install Melpa... Also, can't seem to be able to install or maybe need flycheck (as flymake seems to do a fine job but not on the go)...
 Any advice?
 Thanks very much 😊

 https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-29/?C=M;O=D
 The new (emacs-29.0.60_2) files install/contain/are for 29.0.60, which will become 29.1 once released. (At some point in-between we'll most likey get get at 29.0.90, signaling that we're getting pretty close to official release of the first Emacs 29 as stable.)
 Anyway, please note there's a new deps (and deps-src) archive as the set of DLLs provided now includes libtree-sitter.dll and libsqlite3.dll. This version is also (the first) built with --with-tree-sitter. Here are more complete configure and make recipes:
 ./autogen.sh && ./configure --with-modules \ --without-dbus \ --with-native-compilation \ --without-compress-install \ --with-tree-sitter \ CFLAGS=-O2 \ && make install -j 20 NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1

 In Zim, I bound the action "toggle_editable" to "Ctrl+`", so each time before I switch to doing other stuff or other worskpaces, I press this keybinding to turn off edition in Zim, and when I come back, I press it again to turn it back. It prevents me from mistyping in Zim, and lately using Ctrl+z to revert the changes can be prevented, it's quite annoying.

 I did this yesterday! So i know its possible, & not rocket science. Yesterday I made a patch file like this, with a nice auto-generated file name.
 0001-Add-fubar-to-whizbang.patch
 When I try and use Magit today to do the same with a different range, I end up with either a) multiple patch files, or b) a prompt for a filename for the patch file to be produced. Which is a sign I'm on the wrong track, because I did NOT choose the above filename yesterday.
 Can you advise?
 Thank you!

 However, when I tried adding 
 ```
 +INFOJS_OPT: view:info toc:nil
 ```
 I found that although the document exported indeed simulates info files, when I toggled views, I can't fold headlines. However, folding is indeed possible in the documentation of org-info.
 In the org-info-src.js file, the portion intended to locate the content under a headline is
  var folder = document.getElementById("text-"+t.BASE_ID); 
 where t.BASE_ID is the id attribute of the exported HTML file, e.g. org16a9dc9.
 However, there is no element with the id text-org16a9dc9 - possibly due to some change in Org Mode exporting schemes since 2010, when the script was supposedly last updated.
 Therefore, a small modification is required to make folding possible.
 I fixed folding by changing the above line to: (pardon my poor JavaScript skills)
  var folder = t.BASE_ID ? document.getElementById("outline-container-" + t.BASE_ID).querySelector("div:nth-child(2)") : null;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This may be obvious to some of you, but I came across this just today, so wanted to lay this out clearly in case it helps others.
 git log has a mechanism to trace evolution of lines across commits - think of this as an even more fine grained version of seeing log for a single file. This "-L" arg in git takes the form of -L<start>,<end>:<file> to restrict to certain line numbers or -L:<funcname>:<file> to restrict to a particular function. Magit has the "-L" infix argument to use this directly - but this interface makes you do the manual work of feeding in the input.
 Instead, you can use the direct options available in magit-file-dispatch bound to C-c M-g by default. To trace functions, use the t command (trace) to trace the function under cursor. To trace particular lines - mark region and then call C-c M-g l to see the commit history only for those lines.
 This last command is basically (magit-log-buffer-file) which you can bind directly to something more easy to use. If you use evil, something like the following will make this much easier to use:
 (define-key evil-visual-state-map (kbd ";gl") 'magit-log-buffer-file)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I just started using emacs 29 with treesitter. 
 I wanted to write a function that I could use to highlight keywords like TODO, FIXME etc. in code comments using treesitter. 
 I know there is a package `hl-todo` that I can just import. But the package contains a lot more than I actually need. 
 I also wanted to get familiar with emacs font-lock, font-faces and treesitter. But the documentation for the treesitter used by emacs seems a bit spotty. I'd be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction here. I would also be grateful if anyone could tell me if treesitter is actually a good fit for this or not.
 The high-level plan was to make a query to treesitter to get all `comment` nodes and then search the text in the nodes to see if there are any keywords that need to be highlighted (it would be great if there is a query that could just return those keywords, but I couldn't find such a query). But I'm not quite sure how to proceed from there. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 This is probably a question that's been asked before, but i thought i'd get some fresh opinions.
 ​
 If you were to build a new emacs-type repl/editor, what would you differently?
 ​
 For example, I wouldn't mind a more feature rich approach to what can be displayed. Treating everything as text in buffers is great, but I would love to write and quickly pull out my pen to draw a graph. (This was inspired by the recent post on editor engines)
 ​
 Subtle improvements are cool, but i want to know what you would do to radically alter the paradigm of how you interact with emacs.

 Best,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fascinating combination of office furniture types in 1906! 

The Adjustable Table Company of Grand Rapids, Michigan manufactured a combination table for both telephones and index cards. It was designed as an accessory to be stood next to one's desk to accommodate a telephone at the beginning of the telephone era and also served as storage for one's card index.
Given the broad business-based use of the card index at the time and the newness of the telephone, this piece of furniture likely was not designed as an early proto-rolodex, though it certainly could have been (and very well may have likely been) used as such in practice.
I totally want one of these as a side table for my couch/reading chair for both storing index cards and as a writing surface while reading! Bonus points for wheels that allow it to travel around the house.

 If you are familiar with org-modern, this package approximates the block "bracket" style of that mode, but it works with org-indent. It can be used with or without org-modern.
 This new version is a complete rewrite, and uses font-locking instead of deep hacking of org-indent itself. This enables styling of "bulk-indented" blocks with extra indentation, e.g. inside nested lists, and works well with org-src-block-faces.

 emacsclient: No socket or alternate editor. Please use:

I've also noticed that the response to the command 'emacs --daemon' is different as well. 
 Before my reboot, entering that command would result in some output and then the prompt returning. At the moment the prompt does not return. 
 But emacs is definitely running. If I do 'ps auxw | grep emacs' then I can see an emacs process. 
 What could be happening here? How do I get my emacs client/server back?

Some bullets I want to mark as TODOs. But only headlines can be TODOs, so I switched from everything-bullets to everything-headlines.
 But it seems the Emacs defaults don't expect me to have dozens of levels of headlines deep; I need to adjust things like `org-refile-targets` to look deeper than 9 levels, and exporting to HTML gives me a bunch of ugly headings instead of bulleted lists.
 It really feels like I'm supposed to be using bullets or paragraphs, but I can't see how I can easily throw a TODO here or there in either of those formats.
 What am I doing wrong?

 I launch in emacsclient through mobaXterm with server X. It is really good to have the GUI and to do copy/paste easily on Windows system. But debugging is difficult. I tried Dap mode with vscode-cpptool, gdb, also realgud-gdb. But it is painful with slowness. I don't know if using another tool that mobaXterm as for example Kitty could solve this slowness debbuging issue. I could use emacs in terminal but I would have the same that follow with Lunarvim.
 For Lunarvim
 I can launch it directly with mobaXterm. It is fast and debugging is good and fast too(dap or termdug). But all copy/paste is painfull because it is needed to use particular shortcut of maboXterm and it is not window related.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When great speakers are banned from conferences just because they are uncomfortable it’s not good. People have different opinions about the future direction of Scala but it’s so infected. It’s better to be inclusive and allow people with different opinions. But I guess today’s cancel culture has won. But it hurts the Scala community especially when it really needs to show a good light. Java is becoming much better and heaps of developers are adopting Kotlin and TypeScript.
 Scala 3 is such a great language and it’s such a shame that things like this destroys the image of the Scala community.
 I work as a software architect and have great influence over technical choices. I take lots of factors in to consideration when technologies are chosen. Community is one of them. 
 Let people have different opinions and don’t cancel people just because you don’t agree with them. Try to set the bar high and don’t let feelings control you or your organisation.

This week I practiced my onboarding of an idea spark into my ZK. For 6 of the ten new notes this week, I used the following workflow to get ideas for the stages they are at. Practice exposed a few gaps in my workflow, and I was able to correct them and practice more. The formatting and some of the housekeeping became automated and easy to complete making time for the fun of considering the idea's connection.
This is not the only workflow I use, but the one I used several times this week. Books, PDFs, lectures, and YouTube videos are treated differently. Web articles sparked all six of these notes I'm describing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My config is large and it pulls in, quite a few packages. With some packages, I wonder what parts of my config require those packages. So for debugging purposes, I figured, it would be useful to get dropped into the elisp debugger, when a certain package is loaded, required, etc..
 Question: Is there an (preferably easy) way to achieve that?
 An naive approach, early in my init.el, like:
  (defun my-drop-into-dbg-onto-require (feature &optional filename noerror) (when (string-search (symbol-name 'vimish-fold) (symbol-name feature)) (debug))) (advice-add 'require :before #'my-drop-into-dbg-onto-require) (defun my-drop-into-dbg-onto-load (file &optional noerror nomessage nosuffix must-suffix) (when (string-search "vimish-fold" file) (debug))) (advice-add 'load :before #'my-drop-into-dbg-onto-load) 
 did not work out. 
 Notes: "vimish-fold" used in above code is just an example, I could have used another package name for this example. Also: bisecting my config can only be the very last resort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm begin to using vterm for my daily work, but i have some questions about his behavior.
 When i want to copy some text, i'm ok to enter vterm-copy-mode , select , copy.
 But when i want to use the mouse to select, I don't want to enter vterm-copy-mode with the keyboard before selecting with the mouse.
 ​
 Have you some ideas ? like maybe enter directly in copy-mode when i click for begin the selection ?
 Someone have some tips for configuration vterm to behave more like a normal terminal, or tmux behavior ?
 ​
 Thank you !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm wondering how to reimplement one of my yasnippet snippets in TempEL, but struggling with the following scenario (I didn't find an issue, but don't want to ping minad if I might just have overlooked or misunderstood it in the readme):
 In Haskell, I often write things of the form
 haskell newtype FooBar = FooBar { unFooBar :: String } 
 In a snippet, I'd like to enter the FooBar once right after newtype and have it be the default value for the subsequent places. But I also want the 2nd and 3rd FooBar to be a "stop" where I can enter a different value.
 When using (s name) for the first, and name for the others, they get skipped. When using (s name) for the others as well, all three change simultaneously. So I tried using the form variants of (p ...), but to no avail.
 Here's what I currently use, but it lacks the possibility to change locally:
 lisp (nt "newtype " (s name) " = " name " { un" name " :: " p " }") 
 Can you help me? [Ideally, I'd like to actually change the whole unFooBar in the third place, but that's probably the same problem in disguise, just that the default value is calculated by a form.]

 Does anyone know how to configure eyebrowse so that when a project is opened, the first "window" would be treemacz with a code buffer, while the next window layout would be two vterm frames split horizontally?
 ​
 An even better thing would be for the one vterm window to run "rails s" and the othe one to run "npm start --prefix client"
 ​
 I do this a ton for React and Rails projects so I figured I might make my life easier with this. Any help would be awesome.

 Thanks!

 I have big experience with typescript + angular.
 The purescript-halogen seemed the best for me because I don't want to struggle with the 'nix, ghcjs' build/environment.
 What do you think ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Topiary aims to be a universal formatter engine within the
Tree-sitter ecosystem. Named after the art of clipping or trimming
trees into fantastic shapes, it is designed for formatter authors and
formatter users:
Authors can create a formatter for a language without having to write
their own formatting engine, or even their own parser.
Users benefit from uniform, comparable code style, across multiple
languages, with the convenience of a single formatter
tool.
The core of Topiary is written in Rust, with declarative formatting
rules for bundled languages written in the Tree-sitter query
language. In this first release, we have
concentrated on formatting OCaml code, capitalising on the OCaml
expertise within the Topiary Team and our colleague, Nicolas Jeannerod.

 Hello guys I made a devicons theme for treemacs. This is inspired by nvim-web-devicons and vim-devicons. Here are some screenshots:
 treemacs-devicons in GUI
 treemacs-devicons in terminal
 Motivation: I have been using Emacs for years but I never really sit down and wrote any serious elisp code myself. This time things changed because I saw the nvim-web-devicons. I like trying various kinds of editors, and then I found this devicons from vim editor. I really like it especially because it works in the terminal. People always say Emacs is best within GUI but there are times when you have to edit something in a terminal and maybe some like me just like terminal aesthetics. I mean I really like this devicons theme from vim but I never really liked vim keybindings. I want it to be part of Emacs so bad so I finally decided to learn some elisp and make it happen.
 This is my first emacs package so please give it a try and provide some feedbacks!

 What would be your opinion on these options?
 Here is a first draft of a benchmark (to be updated):
 - DBI : Database indexation

 What did Functional Programming ever do for us software engineers? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glDudJ3fqLk time: 00:52:26
 I think this video helps explain significant differences between some of the popular languages and why there has been a trend toward FP-type language capabilities and it distinguishes very well between those a typical programmer might want to use and where to leave off from those a library writer might need.
 He uses Scala for examples throughout, so it's very familiar. My only complaint is that the sound volume is too low. For anyone wondering why we need FP features or what key language features allow us to do, this is a great introduction.

 I use exwm and I'm able to switch between emacs specific buffers (emacs's shell, text editing buffer, scratch buffer) using the keys in the photo, but once I switch to a firefox or a another non emacs application these specific keys lose that ability to switch buffer and instead manipulate the firefox application is my best guess.
 My question is how to I make it that these keys retain the functionality they have when focusing on emacs specific buffers so when I'm in a fire fox buffer I'm able to switch to another using these keys.

 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not new to Haskell, but I found myself today torn between putting `get` in front of a function vs not doing it, and was hoping for some advice.
 ``` defaultDbUser :: String defaultDbUser = "defUser"
 getDbName :: String -> String getDbName appName = appName <> "-db" ```
 Here I didn't put get in front of defaultDbUser, because it is not a function but a value, and that feels ok.
 For the second function, getDbName, I put get in front because it takes some inputs and then returns "db name".
 This is where I am not sure if this is correct move. I am tempted to call it just dbName :: String -> String, because get feels Java-ish. But, from experience, if I go with just dbName, I later get into trouble, for example when I want to call the function and store its value, something like let dbName = getDbName appName, I would have a very hard time figuring out a name for that binding if I called the function dbName and not getDbName.
 So it feels like getDbName is reasonable, but then again, I can't say I am fond of it very much -> I don't have a better idea though.
 What would you do in this case? Would you use dbName or getDbName? If not, why not? Would you maybe put something else?
 Btw, I do put verbs in general, but with most of the other verbs it is clear they should go there, beacuse you are doing some parsing, calculating, migrating, ... . But with get it somehow feels a bit tedious.
 Thanks!

 who is willing to share their LaTeX setup with the rest of us so that we may get inspired?
 I am in the process of migrating to emacs but still cannot wrap my head around the correct setup for my LaTeX documents. I have been using LaTeX for years and would like to have full control over it while on the other hand profiting from the power of org-mode.
 So I decided to go with org-files for organising my projects (articles, books, worksheets, ...) and use blocks of LaTeX source code inside these documents that I then tangle to a TeX file and run luaLaTeX from the terminal on. While reading that, an emacs power user will probably turn pale, but that's the way I do it for now since I am lacking a better alternative. So I am looking forward to your setups!
 As a beginner I resorted to (the for me very likable) DOOM Emacs with latex option (should include auctex and a sane company setup).

 I primarily use rmarkdown/polymode for school; but increasingly find myself using it for bash/python/ielm/etc in a fashion I imagine advanced org-ob users would find quaint.
 In order to keep the various modes consistent, I bound shift-ret to all of the various shell-send variants, including 'elpy-shell-send-statement-and-step for python blocks. Most of the time this works perfectly, but on a significant number of occasions the statement sent to the REPL breaks out and includes a significant portion of my markdown ramblings, other blocks, etc. This of course leads the python interpreter to question my sanity.
 My question: I assume the problem lies in one of the various regexps used to define a statement/codecell/line; but I have not figured how to trace what is happening and where it is going wrong. Does anyone here have suggestions for how I might best play with these interactions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use the orderless style with consult/corfu mainly, but I get the feeling I have some suboptimal patterns habitualized.
 I thought it might be interesting to:
  
see the completion styles others find most effective and/or nicest to use
 see how other consult/orderless users may do completions differently
  
For instance, say you need to type provide. Three are a few options that immediately come to mind assuming orderless completion:
  
Just type it
 prov M-i RET
 ( p M-i r v RET
  
I guess you could say I'm curious to see what patterns others default to and where they just type something versus completing it.
 If I want to type propertized-buffer-identification for instance, I'd almost certainly use autocomplete with one of:
  
( p M-i buf i RET
 ( p M-i iden RET
  
Then I think and wonder "wouldn't flex be more convenient for this? So I switch to it and my first attempt is:
  
( pbident M-i RET
  
I guess most efficiency is dominated here not by selecting optimal strategies, but muscle memory and aligning your and your completion systems intuition... but I'm curious to see others examples and opinions!

 I recently decided to try switching to more built-in options such as the new built-in org-cite syntax. I am using the package citar for this (yes, I know org-ref can also be changed to use the new built-in syntax). 
 But how do I handle cross-reference suggestions? i.e. referencing a Table or a Figure using \ref{} in LaTeX. Org Mode has support for linking to these but I would like a package that suggests items in the document I can link to using the Org link syntax.
 Org ref supports linking but using its own syntax and not the org-mode one. 
 I found the package oxr from the author of citar which does this but it does not seem to have active development.
 ​
 Any suggestions welcome!

 To get some practice i figured I'd write up the dot product and vector product functions. I haven't begun looking at the vector product, but for dot product I quickly came to
 dot a b = sum $ zipWith (*) a b 
 After toying around with composition (the B-combinator .), I couldn't get it to work. I looked up the tacit solution in pointfree.io, and it gave me the short and sweet
 dot = (sum .) . zipWith (*) 
 Now here's my question: how is (sum .) supposed to work? I don't get where the arguments implicitly go or how this makes syntactically sense. What is the order of operations?

 Huge thanks to u/angerman for making it possible!
 You can download the APK here: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/releases/tag/v4.5.3 (simplex_armv7a_experimental.apk)
 It should support Android 8+/API 26+ (the currently released version supports Android 10+/API 29+), but we only tested on 9 so far - so please let us know if you try it on 8, and also about any issues you experience.
 We did fix several limitations of lower android versions we could find, and we could not find any 32bit CPU-specific issues.
 It's reasonable to expect bugs, but unless we hit some roadblocks it should be fully available in the next release this month!

 Ive recently gone back to emacs and tried to actually learn it. At first i was using doom emacs, i made a config for it, alls good. Then i tried to open up a project and start coding and i ran into all kinds of issues ranging from lsp not initializing to tab indentation being 2 spaces insted of 4 in half of the modes and completions not heaving any relevant suggestions. So then i switched to spacemacs because i thaught that it had better support for rust and was better integrated. Turns out it was a similar story, completions sucked lsp half of the time didnt initialize and i had to explicitly enable it with M-x lsp every time i opened a project. 
 Its now the third day that im just tinkering with emacs and i didn't solve any of the issues listed above.
 Is emacs just bad developer experiance? Am i missing something? Am i just dumb and its a simple solution?
 I want to love emacs, but its making it real hard to do it.
 note: the lsp issue i could maybe live with, but the completions and indentation issues are really bad. A specific case when the completions are the worst at is for example somstructvar.<completions here> or when importing (rust example use somemod::<completion here>), the indentation is bad mainly in js/ts (rjsx) and json

 I tried installing treemacs, but it doesn't show up in my 'package-install' list. Am I making some kind of trivial mistake, or is this a case where I would have to manually install the script?
 EDIT: resolved by ensuring that the melpa repo was added.

 I uploaded 3 images with context that should explain more what I am expected to get. Example are really simple but I face similar things elsewhere ...
 Expected behavior (VSCode)
 Not enough dude! Please tell me more (Emacs)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the past months, I've been chasing down mysterious memory leaks in some of our services. But the graphs have baffled me a little bit (https://i.imgur.com/YguM1GA.png). And I have a few questions. 
 This particular service is compiled with GHC 8.6.5 (old, I know, but we have a large codebase we need to upgrade). It is an API service that deals with Postgres (using Opaleye), Redis (using Hedis) and serves data on a Servant based Wai/Warp HTTP server. The service is quite busy, serving in the range thousands of requests per minute (conservative). 
 The pattern of memory use looks very odd to me: it hovers around 10-20% for several days, and then it jumps to 60%+ percent. The service still doesn't completely crash, but it seems to me that the memory use spikes out of nowhere and fails to fall. There are sudden falls, but that is due to AWS starting multiple instances of the service (auto-scaling). 
 The memory spikes also seem to occur on identical traffic patterns. 
 My questions here are:
  
Does this look like a memory leak? I've read previously that GC is not very "eager" unless tuned.
 If it does, what are the best ways to catch these early? These are quite problemmatic, obviously, and I've been hunting around for weeks without any success. 
 I have tried profiling to investigate leaks earlier, but in this case, I've been unable to reproduce the issue locally or on our staging environment.

When I'm editing a file (for example a cpp file) and I want to access to a terminal, I enable eshell-mode but the problem is that is opens eshell in the current buffer, mixes the shell output with my file and makes the buffer unusable. So if I want to edit the file again, I have to close the buffer, then find the file again. And when I execute eshell-mode again to disable it, it has no effect as it looks like it opens another shell in the eshell. Also when I press C-d, it terminates the shell but it doesn't return to my file. Js there a way to disable eshell mode so I don't have to kill my buffer and open the file again? And how can I open eshell in a new buffer by default?

Philosophy papers often include a lot of specialise language and long, difficult-to-spell terms, which have to be typed out a lot.

 I can't find a way to do this though. Any ideas?

 I believe it would be nice to have that coloring, that it would make it easier to read docs -> any suggestions on where to look in order to add this? I am guessing some kind of contribution is needed somewhere to get that working? Is this something that could be done relatively easily, or is there a technical reason why it is difficult?
 EDIT: I think I was a bit quick to ask, as I think I have found a relevant issue on Haddock, I am guessing this is at the core of it: https://github.com/haskell/haddock/issues/742 , so I ended up asking a question there. I will leave this thread open though in case there might be some interesting discussion.

 Hello, everyone!
 Been new to emacs, have struggled to initially use it, one thing I missed alot from vim editors is hopping/jumping support. Options like avy & ace-jump-mode didn't seem very appealing due to various reasons written in the project readme itself. Hence I started writing my own plugin taking inspiration from hop.nvim and avy.el. And here we are!
 Note that there are still a few nitpicks mentioned at the bottom of the readme. Therefore, if anyone wishes to make improvements, including addressing those nitpicks or elsewhere (I'm new to elisp, so may not have written the most optimal script), they are more than welcome to do so.
 Thank you!

 Dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. Dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants.
 Dunai comes with:
  
bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.

 I am adding kanban style notes to a web dev project I am working on, but am wondering if the following is possible:
  
Is it possible to somehow generate an Org mode table that lists all of the tasks in a given subheading with their task state as the column header for a given Kanban board swim lane?
  
Ex:
  
I have the following Org Mode headings present 
 Backlog
 In Progress
 In Review
 Completed
 
 With this in mind, I want to be able to do that when I move tasks between these 4 headings, they would show up under a related ASCII table hyperlinked to the task itself so that it looks in a similar fashion to how Jira tickets on a Kanban board would look like
  
Thanks!

 Does anyone have an Emacs config that they could share that allows for IDE-like indentation on the fly, kind of like how VS Code handles projects with the following formats:
  
JSX
 Typescript
 React
 Angular
 Vanilla JS
  
​
 I don't want to have to save the file every time I want this (aka I do NOT want to use Prettier). 
 I want this to just happen like it does in VS Code where indentation of code happens on the fly and correctly marks just a few spots for syntax errors.
 In the past, every time I have tried to configure Emacs for indentation, it messes up the whole file to cause a jenky mess of badly indented web dev type code, when it should only really be concerned with the current block you're editing etc.
 Thanks!

 Is this a normal and accepted practice? I've never coded professionally in lisp based languages, but from my experience I always try to make my files no more than 100 or 200 lines long at most. Otheriwise it gets hard to navigate the code in my opinion.
 Maybe in elisp this isn't as bad of a practice? Are there ways in emacs that can help work with long files that I'm not aware of?

 Back again to use Emacs to do some Rust with LSP and I find myself not enjoying at all some part.
 One thing I so much dislike is the way completion is working.
 I am using spacemacs: vim mode, evil blabla, auto-complete & LSP
 And yes you have completion if you add some letters but I cannot see a way to trigger the famous popup of completion listing all possible function without typing a letter ... so unfortunately on complicated code I have to delete letter and add other.
 What a mess! In VSCode I would do Ctrl+Spc for triggering the popup. But here I really do not know how to achieve that, mostly also that I am at this stage in Edit mode.
 I am not expecting this to be rocket science but reading the doc I do not see how to achieve such feature.

With everything set up, I can confirm that I'm running c++-ts-mode when I open a cc file. However, my previous indentations like c-basic-offset set via c-mode-common-hook are not being honored. How do I control the indentation when c++-ts-mode is enabled? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by the recent repeat-map discussions (thanks u/karthink), I immediately noticed that rectangle-mark-mode (C-x SPC) was the perfect target for single-key quick bindings. Why? Any time I explicitly activate rectangle-mark-mode, I do so only to call one of the various *-rectangle-* commands next. So why should I remember/type their prefixes? And what's more, I can see that I have this mode active by the region shape & left border.
 Repeat wasn't the right approach, but it was simple to activate a transient map in rectangle-mark-mode-hook. Check this tiny gist. So C-x SPC, highlight your desired rectangle, then [k]ill [d]elete del-[<SPC>] [c]lear [o]pen s[t]ring [w]-copy [y]ank [N]umber. I didn't even know about the (unbound) command delete-whitespace-rectangle, but will use it often now that I don't have to bind/remember it.
 The only thing I wish for is the ability to recall the region of the last marked rectangle (line+col; from, to), for when you'd like to do a series of rect operations in a row on the same columns.

 For example one of my shells has the buffer name of *myco-back-end-server*. In this shell I always run a script to start the server.
 How can I get the shell in *myco-back-end-server* buffer to run the bash script to start the server automatically? I mean, I want to write an interactive elisp function that looks something like this
 (defun my/start-development-session ()
 ( interactive )
 ( shell *myco-back-end-server* )
 ( ;; run bash script here to start the back-end server )
 ( shell *myco-front-end* )
 ( ;; run bash script to start front end )
 ( .. )
 ( etc )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 When I kill buffers, I often get the message from the title. But when I diff-buffer-with-file, I often get Diff finished (no differences).
 What gives? This is super annoying if I'm closing a long-running session with numerous unsaved buffers. 
 I don't want to just save everything without prompting, because sometimes I type accidental changes into a buffer or two. But manually checking these false positives is a pain in the ass. 
 Has anyone else dealt with/solved this? If the current buffer contents at the time of closing matches the file on disk, I don't want to be prompted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a fiction project I am working on I have been reading into parapsychology and branches of what I would consider pseudoscience. In digging into this work, I've found read some fascinating stuff from people who strongly believe in and/or participate in this kind of research. Their first-hand testimony is going to be valuable for some of the world-building and plot development I want to do in my speculative fiction.
Now, I want to track this information in my zettelkasten. But I also feel some small anxiety that I'll be "polluting" my notes with some of this stuff. I'm curious about how others who do this kind of research handle materials that would not be the kind of thing you'd espouse yourself, but something you want to keep a record of for some other purpose.
Second: do you keep biographical information in your zettelkasten? In this same case, I've encountered a few recurring names that I would like to track. While my novel's not going to be based whole cloth on any of these figures, I am drawing some inspiration from real life programs and work and events. My initial thought is to create a structure note related to the individual that I might put a smattering of biographical information in that can then spin off into some specifics about their life and work that matters to me. But again, curious about how others have handled this.]]></summary>

Im seeing that Scala is loosing popularity and my question is - is it a good idea to work there, with the option of becoming a niche developer that is experienced with an unpopular lang, or should i progress with other companies that use more familiar languages such as node, python etc...?

 Would you pay for a yearly license for an Emacs distro preloaded with things such as Magit, lsp-mode, etc? Basically, a good out of the box IDE experience. The majority (80%?) of the proceeds could be donated to the devs of the packages. Basically, a nice value add that also benefits our package devs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are the secrets to high performance Haskell? I've met people who claim that Haskell code should perform around 5-10x slower than C, Tikhon Jelvis says that mildly optimized Haskell can perform around 3x C in time, kuribas claims that Haskell should perform at least at 50% of C, an acquaintance can get Haskell to half of Rust's performance, and there's libraries like Attoparsec and Streamly that claim 80-90% of C performance. And of course, there's Don Stewart.
 ​
 What's the secret to getting high performance Haskell? Are the ultra-fast libraries concurrency scams (i.e, C is single-threaded, Haskell is parallel)? Or are the ultra-fast libraries actually as fast as they claim, and that it's possible to get Haskell to near-C speeds? 
 Because I love Haskell as a fun toying-around language, given how concise the language (and functional style) can be. Especially when you have defections to the Rust camp, keeping Haskell performant is a worthy goal, and I guess high-performance Haskell is joked about as "only if you're Don Stewart" or "dark magic, summoned by sacrificing puppies and kittens".
 ​
 Any tips, links, advice to get ultra-high-performance Haskell, other than, perhaps, inline-C? ;)

 I wrote the following org file to test it out and exported it to latex:

 But the code block in the pdf looks messy and I was wondering how I can properly format the code block in org mode so that when it gets exported to latex it looks professional?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know emacs has much better autocomplete (e.g. yasnippets) than Overleaf. However, I've found that simply defining new commands in overleaf goes a long way and provides similar benefits to using snippets. Also, org mode has the option to render LaTeX directly inside the editor instead of having one screen for the editor and another for the rendered output. I guess the bullet point features of org mode are also pretty cool. However, despite all of these cool features, I find when I use emacs I end up wasting a lot of time researching how to do stuff. In practice I find simply writing things up in Overleaf to be a lot faster. Does emacs eventually get faster if you're good enough at it?

My fingers may have spazzed out like they sometimes do when trying to input a complicated keychord, but it is weird that all of a sudden this is not working. Does anyone have any idea what to do? I restarted emacs but that does not solve the problem, and neither does re-evaluating the cdlatex.el file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've released ekg version 0.2. Why it feels like just yesterday I was release ekg version 0.1, and in fact it wasn't that long ago.
 ekg is a note taking application for emacs that stores all data in sqlite, is very tag-oriented, and designed to be easy to extend.
 The changes for version 0.2 are:
  
Added hooks ekg-add-schema-hook, ekg-note-pre-save-hook, ekg-note-save-hook, ekg-note-delete-hook, and ekg-note-add-tag-hook to enable customization.
 New commands ekg-show-notes-latest-captured, =kg-show-notes-latest-modified, for showing notes created or modified recently.
 Introduced variable ekg-notes-size to control the default page size for limited views such as ekg-show-notes-latest-captured.
 Added templating.
 Added embedding as an optional add-on, to enable note similarity and note search; requires an account at OpenAI or similar embedding provider.
 Added new function ekg-active-notes to easily get all non-trashed notes.
 Improved ability to have note list buffers that have flexible titles and operation, notably improving the ekg-show-notes-in-trash command.
 Standardized buffer names for ekg-notes-mode buffers, which all are prepended with "ekg" and surrounded by asterisks, to denote that they are non-file-based.
 Added documentation in texinfo, viewable via M-x info.
 Fixed bug interfering with completion at the beginning of the tag property line.
  
For details, watch the demo of 0.2 changes. I think the templating is done via a unique way that shows off the power of ekg, and embedding stuff is advanced, super useful, and virtually no other note app in any system has it. On the other hand, the embeddings costs a very small amount of money and has unfortunate privacy implications. I think it's well worth it, and I hope that you enjoy this update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hear me out here. Before you downvote me, I'm not advocating that any functional changes be made to Emacs regarding car and cdr. I've looked up a brief history of the terms and their origins. They have their uses and should be neither removed nor renamed.
 However, as someone who's only recently learned about these terms, Emacs' self-documentation for these terms was not helpful at all to me. I saw the function being used in existing Elisp and thought, "What's car and cdr?" So I looked it up inside Emacs, and it told me that car returned the car of LIST. Wow... super helpful...
 I'd offer to submit a pull request to update the documentation if the source code wasn't managed via email, but it is. So, I'm just putting my opinion out here where someone else who contributes might read this. ``` car is a function defined in C source code.
 Signature (car LIST)
 Documentation Return the car of LIST. If LIST is nil, return nil.
 Error if LIST is not nil and not a cons cell. See also car-safe.
 See Info node (elisp)Cons Cells for a discussion of related basic Lisp concepts such as car, cdr, cons cell and list.
 Other relevant functions are documented in the list group.   cdr is a function defined in C source code.
 Signature (cdr LIST)
 Documentation Return the cdr of LIST. If LIST is nil, return nil.
 Error if LIST is not nil and not a cons cell. See also cdr-safe.
 See Info node (elisp)Cons Cells for a discussion of related basic Lisp concepts such as cdr, car, cons cell and list.
 Other relevant functions are documented in the list group. ```

 I heard about orgmode. I hang out in r/emacs and whenever someone asks "why not vim/vscode/etc.", besides other points it's orgmode. So I've been tempted to try it out. And I don't regret

 Works well so far!

A <script> tag for the JS or TS code, a <style /> tag for any component-specific styles, and a <template /> tag wrapping the actual markup. Aside from some additional syntax in the <template /> itself, Vue files are very similar to HTML files. However, getting good indentation, syntax highlighting, and LSP behavior can be...trying.

I can see the benefit of incorporating this feature into longer Elisp processes as well. However, controlling the progress bar natively requires the use of Applescripts, which can be difficult without the official IDE. As Emacs users, we naturally desire an Emacs Lisp binding. 
 I would greatly appreciate any guidance on how to create bindings for the described functionality (elisp <-> shell <-> applescript). Thank you very much!

When I am programming in python or c++, the debug message is helpful as it points out what line the issue is on and why it occurred.

What is the best practice or steps or tutorials on how to debug large files of elisp code or emacs errors?

 a c e g i 
 And I have:
 b d f 
 I want to be able to use one copy and one paste to achieve this:
 a b c d e f g i 
 Basically if I have 5 lines of text in my kill ring, I want to use string-rectangle at the end of a different set of 5 lines and paste the 5 lines from my kill ring directly alongside without moving any of the other lines around. I hope this mess makes sense to somebody.

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyJZzq0v7Z4 time: 00:46:08
 It's excellent for understanding the roots and means by which certain languages came into the world and why they are imperative or OOP and/or FP.
 I think we identify an underlying theory of programming when someone starts to build the tool to do that kind of programming. Naturally there will be a lot of overlap with other languages which are also tackling similar tasks. Richard Feldman, in the video, describes a lot of that in a very clear and entertaining way.
 Scala's place in this lineage and facing those issues
 The Scala community has to tackle those same issues. For example, what is the programing paradigm, what is the name of it, and what are the techniques & parts…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to announce Codd. 
 Codd is a tool that applies plain postgres SQL migrations atomically (when postgres allows it) and enforces schema consistency checks to ensure different environments have the same schema. It also helps by providing meaningful merge conflicts for when e.g. different developers modify the same DB objects, among other interesting features. Please check its GitHub for what it can do! 
 We've been using codd at PRODA for some months (though we've been using parts of it for far longer in a transition and test period) to apply our migrations, run schema consistency checks and manage our multiple environments' databases, from dev to staging, production and tests. I'd like to thank my friends at PRODA for their support and feedback all this time: it has been invaluable. 
 Now I find it's time to release codd to a broader audience, and thought of this community because it's written in Haskell. 
 I hope the documentation on GitHub explains reasonably how codd works and its nuances. I'm open to questions and feedback of all kinds here as well!

I've never used BibTeX before and I'm quite new to Org mode and Emacs, so I might be missing something.
 Also, is it possible to have numbered citations?

It doesn't work. Has anyone got this package working?

 Also espotify.el complains of nonexisting dbus service file for spotify, while Spotify DBus is clearly functional and I can use it from the command line. 
 It would be nice to have Spotify controls with vertico fuzzy search.

Is "open-ended question" what I hope it is? "Closed question" would be sth. that you can answer with yes, no, 100; an "open-ended question" would be sth to just talk about. Fits the Wikipedia definition, but is it really without end?
Early on, there's this paragraph:

  
What remains is that you are not taking up the ball yourself. Someone else is supposed to pick it up, then add something to "the discussion" (or rather: start it), and then throw the ball back.

 **** subsubhead1 
 **** subsubhead2 
 //(a lot of sub heads 
 **** subsubhead1000 
 *** subHead2 
 *** subHead3 
 then when will run a myTag research I will have all the 1000 subsubhead items, this is not good I guess 
 Is this the "right" approach one should follow? Basically i could mark some sub tags in the children and then refine my research? 
 It would be possible to custom in the headers #+ of the file on top the level of nested tags that have to consider? In this way I would have a tag for the subHead but not for the subsubHead(the children of a subHead)

 If I had a little visual indicator in the margin, to remind me what the thing was I'm looking at, it would help a lot.
 Is there a way to make such an indicator and move it around easily? I'm not terribly interested in learning elisp just now. Maybe when the kids are grown up...
 [EDIT] Actually, it might not be critical for it to be visible. I might be able to use setting and swapping mark and point, except that that creates a region - which is an unwanted side effect for what I am trying to do.
 [EDIT] replaced mark with indicator to avoid confusion.

For (some) Linux systems, there's an open source app targeting GTK/GNOME that was shared in my interweb circles recently:

It looks very minimalistic. Some scripting/automation features would be useful to more quickly generate (Markdown-compatible) citations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I understand that Emacs has TRAMP which allows working on a remote host via SSH. However, other editors are now offering better support for working with Cloud Development Environments, and there hasn't been much discussion about this in the Emacs community. So, I'm curious if anyone has used Emacs with Gitpod or GitHub codespaces and how they set it up.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I want to share a new package keepass-cli-rs I wrote recently (well actually, it's last December).
 The URL for the repo is https://github.com/fuyu0425/keepass-cli-rs
 I am aware of previous keepass packages like the following, but that does not fit my need.
  
keepass-mode
 keepass.el
  
Some highlight for this new package:
  
based on hydra, so you can quickly switch entries
 use completing-read purely, so you can use your current completion engine.
 ICON!!! which is very important to me to find the entry I want.
 You can find some screenshots in the repo.
  
Some restriction:
  
It's read-only (you cannot edit the database) and only tested by me now.
  
You can only build from source now (it's not on crate.io and Melpa now) because I want some initial feedback!

 How do I save the configuration in order for it to take effect at startup because I thought everything was supposed to save into the .emacs,d folder. but its all just going to the home directory. I 'd like to use org mode for taking notes for all my classes, is it preferred to just keep the notes under one file or is it a best practice to create different files for each subject?
 Is there a way to automatically save .org or config files in the same folder? I'm new to CS and we'll be starting on python but I have no prior programming experience and I've gone over the navigation and watched several tutorials such as Systems Crafters and a few others, read Emacs Wiki, Org website Emacs reference and all the references under getting started for the last two weeks. Is it best to start out vanilla or should I go spacemacs or take copy a different theme. The default white background is blinding me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing my masters in CS, and it won't be long until I finish. It's right now shy to 3 a.m. and I've been losing sleep recently about what I'll do after graduating. To put it mildly, Haskell was everything that I used in the past 4 years. I'd say I'm in an intermediate level in utilizing Haskell. I did my bachelor thesis using Haskell, and doing my master thesis using Haskell again. I also had student jobs in which I taught and programmed using Haskell and Scala.
 I'm starting to ask myself what I'll do after graduating. Do I look for a Haskell job? (I'm based in Germany, and everything I'm finding is requiring to already have many years of experiences in the field which I don't have, and I also found other jobs in cyber security which are related to Functional programming but I have no expertise in that and they always ask for people with experience). This means I can't help but to wonder what I will be doing for living.
 Do I ignore Haskell and fp in general for now? Which other it-jobs could be suitable for someone with my modest expertise? Which other languages should I concentrate at instead? Which IT-jobs should I keep an eye on if Haskell jobs are not within reach? Should I try to find a job in cyber security since many cyber security jobs ask for Haskell developers? Does anyone have a personal experience with my dilemma or any advice on what I must do next? Are there some special platforms for fp programmers who are looking for jobs? I feel right now like a child in the body of a grown-up.

https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/614
  
​
 That being noted, seeing Tux for every Linux application installed via WSL2 sucks.
 ​
 Here's the workaround I used, posting here for anyone else for future reference:
 ​
 Related Workflow Notes:
  
I found the related icon here: 
 https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EmacsIcon.svg
 
 More specifically, I used the '48x48 pixel' version here: 
 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/EmacsIcon.svg/48px-EmacsIcon.svg.png
 
 I then downloaded it via just using Firefox in Windows as 'EmacsIcon.png'.
 I then copied and pasted it to the 'Linux > Ubuntu-22.04 > usr > share > icons' folder (This directory is '\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04\usr\share\icons' in File Explorer on Windows 10)
 The resulting file with path was the following 
 '/usr/share/icons/EmacsIcon.png'
 
 I then edited the '/usr/local/share/applications/emacs.desktop' file to include the following changes:

 ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Zettelnauts,
I started a new book Weinberg On Writing: The Fieldstone Method and it is terrific. Funny, and it contains many insights. Weinberg's 'fieldstone method dovetails nicely with the zettelkasten method.' Before my time here on the forums, @ctietze mentioned Weinberg back in Feb of 2018 - Writing with the Zettelkasten is like building a fieldstone wall and Gerald Weinberg was brought up again by @chrisaldrich back in October - Review of “On Intellectual Craftsmanship” (1952) by C. Wright Mills, I'm slow on the uptake. Still, if you keep pounding away, I'll finally get it.
Please tell me about your past week and what you are working on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey moved from neovim to doomemacs and the more I learn the more I enjoy it. I am having an issue with magit where I can't create a commit. When pressing c -S (my gpg key) c I get the following error which seems that I have well...the wrong keymap. This is confusing as my config is essentially barebone. I am at my wits ends on this issue.
  1 git --no-pager --literal-pathspecs -c core.preloadindex\=true -c log.showSignature\=false -c color.ui\=false -c color.diff\=false commit -- hint: Waiting for your editor to close the file... Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Wrong type argument: keymapp, nil
 I can create a commit in the shell no problem and it will ask for my passphrase. I can push no problem with magit, just can't commit and I believe its due to gpg.
 My gpg-agent.conf:
 ```
 #Do not ask me about entered passwords for 24h (during the same session)
 default-cache-ttl 86400 max-cache-ttl 86400
 pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-tty allow-loopback-entry
 #Allow pinentry in Emacs minibuffer (combined with epg-pinentry-mode)
 allow-loopback-pinentry allow-emacs-pinentry``` 
 Thanks for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I often find myself in writing Elisp with a "data-flow" mindset, meaning "this data should be processed like this, then like this, then like this". I could use some piping techniques, but what if I then need to reuse a partial result? Should I recompute everything? Of course not, let* to the rescue!
 Except that let* syntax is a bit too verbose, I'd like to have something similar to Rust's let. Well, here's my attempt, help yourselves:
 ``` (defmacro rust-let (&rest body) "Allow to have a let Rust-like syntax in BODY."
 (cond ((not body) '()) ((atom body) body) ((listp body) (let ((current-form (car body))) (cond ((not current-form) current-form) ((atom current-form) current-form) ((listp current-form) (if (eq (car current-form) 'rlet) (let ((,(cadr current-form) ,(caddr current-form))) (rust-let ,@(cdr body))) (progn ,current-form (rust-let ,@(cdr body))))) )))))  This allows to turn  (rust-let (rlet a-partial-result (some-func some-data)) (rlet another-partial-result (another-func a-partial-result)) (process-func another-partial-result) ;; but I want to return a-partial-result)  into  (let ((a-partial-result (some-func some-data))) (let ((another-partial-result (another-func a-partial-result))) (progn (process-func another-partial-result) a-partial-result))) ``` Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!

Do you guys use the Design by contract very often? Is this something useful on a production environment? If yes, what tips or references would give me?
 This is just an example I've written testing the preconditions and postconditions feature. Still, all these checks may throw an exception and it's necessary to wrap then on a try-catch block wich would make the code less elegant, are there any solution to this? *If this feature is really useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to introduce the second release of Iris — a Haskell CLI framework that supports CLI Guidelines.
  
https://github.com/chshersh/iris
  
There were lots of changes since the initial release last year, so now would be a perfect time to try Iris!
 The most significant improvements are:
  
A complete tutorial about writing CLI apps in Haskell with Iris
 Lots of Haddock improvements
 Automatic detection of terminal colouring support
  
 See CHANGELOG for more details.
  
​
 I created Iris with the initial goal to provide mentorship to beginners in Haskell, FP, and Open-Source. And, as you can notice, most of the improvements were made by outside contributors. If you would like to contribute something to Iris, check out beginner-friendly issues!
 It takes a lot of effort and patience to help others, but in the end, I hope my guidance was helpful to them 🤗
 P.S. To add a few more positive news, today is also my 29th birthday 🥳🎂 Your best gift to me would be to support my Haskell Open-Source work via GitHub Sponsorship. Or you can just star Iris on GitHub, and this would encourage me to continue doing more Haskell OSS!

 They wrote to me today: 
  
Sorry for the delay, Team has a less experience in Scala tech. We are trying to setup and make it work and also we have aligned the recruitment team to hire the resource with the same expertise.
  
Which basically translated to - they need to hire a Scala dev before they can continue working on my website.
 If anyone is interested, then you can help me by working for them....
 Their Upwork profile is: https://www.upwork.com/agencies/~01edb0e09d72122edd/
 And their website is: https://softobiz.com/
 Personally, there may be a possibility for me to hire a Scala dev directly, but it's not that straightforward since I am not very proficient in code, and my original dev who wrote the backend in Scala has flaked off (for the most part), leaving me trying to figure out how to proceed. That's why I went to an agency rather than hiring directly. The original dev is still around per se, but it takes a week to extract any information from him. Albeit 50% of the info needed is document on Confluence.
 Nevertheless, thought I'd post if anyone was interested.
 Thanks.

 I just recently found out that one can't have something like this in servant:
 UVerb 'PATCH '[JSON] '[ WithStatus 200 Foo, WithStatus 500 ErrorA, WithStatus 500 ErrorB] 
 Which confused me at first because the docs mentions this:
  
A variant of Verb that can have any of a number of response values and status codes.
  
This led me to believe that this was possible, but it seems to be limited to one per status code. Since eventually, all servant seems to care about is the status code, not exactly including the response body itself. The above becomes
 '[200, 500, 500] 
 Which GHC tells me about because genericServeT expects this list to be unique; any duplicate status code will fail regardless of the varying response bodies. 
 While I do understand that doesn't make much s…]]></summary>

 Also another very common task is to change part of a name written in camel or snake case. Both killing and navigating fast to the point where I want to kill would be great!
 However similar questions in stack overflow and the net often get shot down with “just code it yourself”. I probably will, but was just wondering if other people would like that itch scratched or know a canonical solution that’s already available (package)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 In the online tutorials I see examples of people scheduling tasks for particular days, and then the agenda view gives a great overview of tasks for the week.
 The question: What do you do if the day arrives and you are not able to complete many of the items? For me, this is _usually_ the case: either I am hit with an unexpected task at work, or I over-estimate how much I can do in a day.
 Specifically, do you delete the items and create new ones on the next day? Or change their date somehow? It seems like a lot of work to have to re-schedule tasks each day.
 ​
 ​
 Recently I asked this question about setting up an org/todo workflow that does _not_ use dates.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/1163k17/first_time_org_todo_user_fit_it_to_me_or_vice/
 The answer provided worked, but it would need some work to setup an agenda view, and I am wondering if I am just missing the right way to think about org.

 Currently
 I have the log view in my agenda set up to show both closed and clocked tasks by way of (setq org-agenda-log-mode-items '(closed clock state)). When a task is both clocked and closed, I'll see something like this:
 13:30-14:38 Clocked: (1:08) DONE Read a book 14:00...... ---------------- 14:38...... Closed: DONE Read a book 
 I want to suppress the second entry.
 Fumblings
 I think I want something that behaves like org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done, i.e. org-agenda-skip-done-if-clocked, but that doesn't exist.
 I'm not sure how to do it with a custom org-agenda-skip-function either, because whether I want to skip it depends on whether it's been shown already, and I don't think that information is available.
 I thought about using org-agenda-finalize-hook but that seems like it would be hard and probably the wrong way to do it.

 I've seen both Krita-mode and Xournalpp-mode but both seem overkill for what i want to achieve: in particular, I dislike the fact that in Krita you have to specify width and height for the picture you want to create. Xournalpp, on the other hand, is more suited to make complete notes in A4 format, rather than quick sketches.

 I'd like something that is more like a Whiteboard and is possible to embed in emacs with no issue, in whatever size it takes to occupy my sketches. Does anyone here uses something similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XFTP is a new file transfer protocol focussed on meta-data protection - it is based on the same principles as SimpleX Messaging Protocol used in SimpleX Chat messenger:
  
asynchronous file delivery - the sender does not need to be online for file to be received, it is stored on XFTP relays for a limited time (currently, it is 48 hours) or until deleted by the sender.
 padded e2e encryption of file content.
 content padding and fixed size chunks sent via different XFTP relays, assembled back into the original file by the receiving client.
 efficient sending to multiple recipients (the file needs to be uploaded only once).
 no identifiers or ciphertext in common between sent and received relay traffic, same as for messages delivered by SMP relays.
 protection of sender IP address from the recipients.
  
You can download XFTP CLI (Linux) to send files via the command line here - you need the file named xftp-ubuntu-20_04-x86-64, rename it to xftp.
 Send the file in 3 steps:
  
to send: xftp send filename.ext
 to share: pass the generated file description(s) to the recipient(s) via any secure channel, e.g. via SimpleX Chat.
 to receive: xftp recv rcvN.xftp
  
Please let us know what you think, what downsides you see to this approach, and any ideas you have about how it can be improved.
 We are currently integrating the support of XFTP protocol into SimpleX Chat that will allow sending videos and large files seamlessly and without the sender being online - it is coming soon!

 I used both alternatively because I think it is become better on the other side.
 There is always the easy vscode but not with full vim keybinding.
 I decided to share my personal comparaison. 
 Here, I share my point of view. 
 Why I prefer DOOM
  
 LSP (clangd, there the % progression of DB, I know that it is ongoing)
  GUI mode
  Call tree (available natively for C++)
  copy/paste (more easy because of the GUI)
  grep (ripgrep is better integrated for me, no plugin to add)
  find file (the same with fd)
  server mode (emacsclient)
  git (magit)
  Docker (included by default)
  Bookmark (easy to use by default)
  Org mode
  Fold (evil is working well by default)
  installation on windows
  
why I prefer Lunarvim
  
 Comment (simple <cc> shortcut)
  Treesitter (by default first)
  DAP debug (better integrated even in terminal)
  Terminal mode (expected for…)
  C-i/C-o navigation
  Explorateur (nvimtree)
  project (more easy to mksession)
  show invisible char
  git lens
  search & replace(inccommand=split)
  undo (as I want by default)
  configuration (more easy with lua)
  escape key (I can use ’ù’)
  highlight (It is highlighting a word everywhere)
  mergeconflict (thanks to lazygit integration)
  speed
  
Do you have a similar behavior from one to another ? why ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By default, when I add a tag with C-x C-q to an item, the tag is added to the end of heading/item:
 C-x C-q tag
 * Item :tag: 
 I want it to show at the beginning, like this:
 * :tag: Item 
 Because sometimes I have long headings, and the tags get misaligned or in a different line of the item (if visual-line-mode is on). So, I thought that having the tags at the beginning of the item would make the document more organized, since my tags are usually shorter and about the same size.
 Is there a way I could do that? Suggestions are welcome.

 When doing that, I often end up realising I need to pop a TODO in the middle of a thought / text. Now, I do understand that I can make a header be a TODO -> but in this case I will often be in the middle of the bullet point list, or middle of paragraph, and I Just want to pop a TODO there to work more on that piece or to reconsider something later. Kind of like leaving breadcrumbs for later, since I usually do many passes through this document until I completely refine it.
 Of course, I can just write TODO, but then it is not recognized as a TODO by org, and I would like to be able to get a list of all TODOs, mark them as done, move from one to the other, have them nicely syntax highlighted, ... .
 Any advice how to go about this? Should I be doing this in Org in some other way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I wanted to calculate some costs in an org buffer. I heard that calc was powerful and convenient but found it unintuitive when I tried it the last time.
 I gave it a second chance today and had fun using it, entering formulas in the org-mode buffer then marking them with a region and letting calc evaluate the formulas and pasting it back into the buffer. But I needed too many key presses to do this really comfortably, so I made something for the next time, which should be more fun:
 ​
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'calc-insert-result-with-equal-sign) (defun calc-insert-result-with-equal-sign (this-prefix-arg) "Evaluate the expression in the active region using `calc`, insert an equal sign and the result." (interactive "p") (calc-fix-notation 2) (if current-prefix-arg (calc-fix-notation this-prefix-arg)) (let ((expression (buffer-substring-no-properties (region-beginning) (region-end)))) (if (string-empty-p (string-trim expression)) (message "Region is empty.") (let ((result (calc-eval expression))) (goto-char (max (region-beginning) (region-end))) (insert " = ") (insert result) (deactivate-mark))))) 
 ​
 Mark a formula in any buffer, press C-c c to insert " = result" to the right of the region. This will insert the result with 2 digits after the decimal-point. If called with C-u number C-c c it will insert the result with the specified Number of digits after the decimal point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A common task I have when refactoring some code is to search for an occurrence of some text in the codebase and then look at or update the code at that point. For example, I might want to check every use of a certain library is being used in a thread-safe manner.
 So I search for this string - e.g. using consult-git-grep - and I get a list of results. I go to the first result, then do my thing. Now I want to go to the second item in the search and I have to search again.
 Emacs of course makes this as painless as possible since I can do M-p to yoink the previous search term, but it's still a bit inconvenient to have to search again multiple times. I also lose my place in the search list.
 I was wondering if there was a better way of doing this. E.g. is there a way of telling the minibuffer to stay open, so if I search for something I can go through the list methodically?
 Or maybe there's a package that handles this nicely, or is there a better way of using the tools?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently rereading the book "Get Programming with Haskell" and in chapter 4.2 on page 40-42 is an example use case for first class functions: 
 sfOffice name = if lastName < "L" then nameText ++ " - PO Box 1234 - San Francisco, CA, 94111" else nameText ++ " - PO Box 1010 - San Francisco, CA, 94109" where lastName = snd name nameText = (fst name) ++ " " ++ lastName nyOffice name = nameText ++ ": PO Box 789 - New York, NY, 10013" where nameText = (fst name) ++ " " ++ (snd name) renoOffice name = nameText ++ " - PO Box 456 - Reno, NV 89523" where nameText = snd name getLocationFunction location = case location of "ny" -> nyOffice "sf" -> sfOffice "reno" -> renoOffice _ -> (\name -> (fst name) ++ " " ++ (snd name)) addressLetter name location = locationFunction name where locationFunction = getLocationFunction location >> addressLetter ("Bob","Smith") "ny" "Bob Smith: PO Box 789 - New York, NY, 10013" 
 The author then writes the following:
  
Now that you’ve separated each function needed for generating addresses, you can easily add new rules as they come in from each office.
  
While I'm understanding the code itself, I have problems to apply what the author has written.
 Where would you add new rules? Would you write a new rule function and pass it down to the nyOffice for example? This approach doesn't seem to scale well if you add several rules.

        <updated>2023-03-01T08:43:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sorting-network repo: https://github.com/Javran/sorting-network (PRs are welcome!)
 I have this idea of using TH to turn sorting network into partial sort functions for small lists (2 - 16 elements) for a while. Not many resources turn up with I searched Haskell topics on this so I got my hands dirty. I'm happy with the performance (see some benchmark output below) with my proof-of-concept code, so I decided to turn this into a package (apologies that I didn't spend much work on documenting, in my defense I'm quite excited to share it - expect quality to improve in future releases).
 To use this, import Data.SortingNetwork to bring into scope functions like sortList4By :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a] (partial function) and sortTup4By :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> (a, a, a, a) -> (a, a, a, a) (supporting list / tuple of 2 - 16 elements, but TH module is exported so you can generate more).
 To explain how it works, the implementation took some inspiration from https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2018-05-06-sorting-small.html. For a input size 3, a sorting network (more specifically, my package uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcher_odd%E2%80%93even_mergesort - I'll try to try to have optimal network and other varieties in future releases) would compare and conditionally swap a-b, a-c, b-c in that order (I'm kinda relying on optimization to figure out data dependencies and take advantage of parallelism). And the TH generates function like below (name shadowing is intentional for demostration, although in code I do ensure that all new variables are fresh):

 Over the past weeks I've posted about state machines in the context of testing, supervision, hot-code swapping and async I/O.
 Today I'd like to share an experiment in how we can combine state machines into parallel pipelines in a declarative way:
 https://github.com/stevana/pipelined-state-machines#pipelined-state-machines
 I've tried to structure the readme as a self-contained blog post, with motivation, commented code, suggestions for possible extensions and questions that I don't know the answer to yet.
 I hope you find it interesting and I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to build an AST using tree-sitter and I found related nodes which seemingly has what I need. 
 Edit: I am basically redoing this since I made some progress but am getting unexpected results.
 Here is a function that I believe should be getting the parent type, starting/ending position and the parent node. That being said, my output isn't actually giving me the parent node. My output is 
 Parent node:#<user-ptr ptr=0x565357826740 finalizer=0x7fcf98715780>, type: modifiers, start: 46, end: 59
  (defun testing/AST-parent () "Return parent node of the tree-sitter node at point." (interactive) (setq get-parent (tsc-get-parent (tree-sitter-node-at-pos (thing-at-point 'symbol)))) (if get-parent (progn (setq parent-type (tsc-node-type get-parent)) (setq parent-start (tsc-node-start-position get-parent)) (setq parent-end (tsc-node-end-position get-parent)) (message "Parent node:%s, type: %s, start: %s, end: %s" get-parent parent-type parent-start parent-end)) (message "No parent node"))) 
 Edit 2: Solved it! Below is the code that will get the parent node of the node under the cursor. If anyone more knowledgeable on tree-sitter has a better idea to solve this then I'm all ears, but for now this is what I got: 
 ``` (defun testing/AST-parent () "Return parent node of the tree-sitter node at point." (interactive) (let ((node (tree-sitter-node-at-pos))) (if node (message "%s" (tsc-node-type (tsc-get-parent (tsc-get-parent node)))) (message "No parent node at point"))))

 com.wbillingsley %%% veautiful % 0.3.0
 com.wbillingsley %%% doctacular % 0.3.0
 Docs here: https://www.wbillingsley.com/veautiful/
 API here: https://javadoc.io/doc/com.wbillingsley/veautiful_sjs1_3
 https://javadoc.io/doc/com.wbillingsley/doctacular_sjs1_3 
 Veautiful is a "low level control, high level ease of use" front-end library
 Doctacular is a set of components/classes for it that are particularly useful for building teaching materials (e.g. interactive slide decks and tutorials, teaching sites driven by a table of contents)
 They are substantially the same as 0.3-M6.
 Our (southern) autumn teaching trimester has just started, so my focus switches a little from updating the library to the sites that are built using it. i.e. the next release might not be for a few months, as the current one has enough for what I'm teaching at the moment.

 If you have suggestions on how to improve this, please keep in mind the high school algebra limitation. It should either be things that remove unnecessary parts so there's less to remember or things that explain it in even plainer language.

 Vitalii helped me on some points I was struggling but I've managed to make an app which has three modules, one as the worker, another a CLI client and last a REST server which listens to an API using zio-http and fires workflows to the Temporal cluster. The app also publishes Prometheus metrics using zio-metrics.

 Randomly stumbled on this part of the org mode manual:
  
11.4.2 Time-of-day specifications 
 Org mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification. The time can be part of the timestamp that triggered inclusion into the agenda, for example 
 <2005-05-10 Tue 19:00> 
 Time ranges can be specified with two timestamps: 
 <2005-05-10 Tue 20:30>--<2005-05-10 Tue 22:15> 
 In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range)—like ‘12:45’ or a ‘8:30-1pm’—may also appear as plain text.
  
Which means I don't have to fiddle with timestamp creation to adjust my times for tasks/events and I don't have to worry about going in to a file after capturing something to finish putting in a time range. All I need is a date stamp on a headline and this will work automatically. (You can disable this behavior by setting org-agenda-search-headline-for-time to nil.)
 Somehow I hadn't come across this feature before. I've recently gotten more into managing time/time blocking in my org agenda and this was a useful enough discovery that I thought I'd share!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curious as to how I can do this better.
 I'm using a Windows client to access various headless, Linux-based development servers. In many cases I want to edit a file on the remote server, using Emacs.
 Currently, I have just been using SSH (PuTTY) with X11 forwarding enabled. I simply SSH to my target, open the file, and voila Emacs is drawn on my local/Windows client. When I'm on the same local network as the development servers, this works fine.
 When I'm connecting remotely (VPN), oftentimes a much slower connection, this can get a little ugly. It works, yes, but can be painfully slow. For example, hitting page up inside Emacs may take a couple of seconds to draw. This creates the need for some very delicate typing/selecting of text.
 How can I improve this setup? I have started to research emacsclient (to run in Windows) to potentially connect to Emacs on the Linux side (running in daemon mode), but I'm not sure that this is actually the correct approach. It doesn't totally make sense to me, as the file I'm trying to open is located on the daemon/Linux side (not Windows). Any help is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I do ctrl + space to begin selecting a region of text sometimes a nasty bug happens. When I press the up arrow or down arrow to extend the selected region, it sometimes gets "locked" and continues forever as if the arrow key has been held down constantly. This locks out the emacs window as it goes on scrolling up or down forever increasing the selected region. It does not respond to any user input or a ctrl -g break. Any ideas what's wrong ? Usually once it's reached the top or bottom of the buffer the control eventually returns to the user.

 Since I can't really change this, is it possible to use 2 spaces as the indentation style but makes it appear wider? For ex: 2 spaces could look like 4 (only for indentation spaces)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to get hands dirty of calling GHC Wasm Module from browser, here is what I got and I'd like to share my experience. I might be rebuilding some wheels here, please let me and everyone know!
 Full example at: https://github.com/hellwolf/haskell-examples/tree/master/2023-02-24-wasm-comm.
 Browser to Haskell Wasm Reactor Module Communication Example
 Setup Using Nix
  nix shell https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-wasm-meta/-/archive/master/ghc-wasm-meta-master.tar.gz 
 Read more about GHC Wasm: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-wasm-meta.
 Run the Demo
 Build
  $ make 
 Serve
 Using python http.server:
  $ make serve 
 Test
 Visit http://localhost:8000/ from your browser and open console.
 You should see the output:
  echo: hello world client.js:67:12 size before 0 client.js:68:12 size after 2 client.js:71:12 a= 42 client.js:72:12 b= 21 client.js:73:12 c= <empty string> 
 What Was Done
  
A toy Store.hs providing a wasm-independent save2/load2/size2 API globally.
 A WasmComm.hs module that exports Store.hs module through FFI.
 It uses wasm32-wasi-ghc to build a wasm reactor module that exports for Javascript VM to use.
 Browser client library uses browser_wasi_shim to communicate with the module.
  
Javascript String Hurdle
 The biggest challenge is that in order to pass Javascript string between the Wasm Module and Javascript VM, we need to play with the linear memory model of wasm.
 This example creates a few ad-hoc wrapper function to help with the alloc/free memory management convention for the functions exported by the Haskell wasm reactor module.
 Here is an example of how to wrap the Haskell save function as store_save for Javascript usage:
 haskell foreign export ccall save :: CString -> CString -> IO () 
 javascript function store_load(k) { return fromCString(withCString(k, k => inst.exports.load(k))); } 
 Check the client.js for more information about how fromCString and withCString is implemented.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using the Hyper modifier for ages, as a place to put personal bindings. I have xkb rules set up to remap a physical key to the modifier.
 Long story short, since upgrading to Emacs 28.2, the Hyper modifier hasn't been working right. Certain combinations, like H-e work fine, while other combinations like H-i do not. C-h k shows that Emacs gets an unmodified i, but a correctly modified H-e. xev shows that the Hyper keycode is being emitted consistently.
 If I change my X session to start an xterm instead of Emacs, then launch Emacs from the xterm, the modifier works perfectly. But when it's started directly in my session, it works inconsistently.
 I haven't changed any other part of my setup, other than upgrading Emacs.
 Any thoughts what might be wrong here?

 Here's the code, for reference. I don't think I've done anything particularly weird, and I've stared at this for a while with no luck. The transient actually works, it's just that the incompatibility doesn't, so I'm still manually setting and unsetting the client and server flags. Not …]]></summary>

selda (Postgres, SQLite)

 beam (Postgres, SQLite)
  
Do you have experience with one or multiple of these libraries? Let me know what you prefer.
 From looking at the manuals quickly I liked selda the best, but maybe you know better than me :)

 So basically, the Emacs theme I created is fine for Org Mode and some modes, but it sucks for vterm usage, especially for 'curses' style terminal programs where its just blindingly bad.
 I don't have the time to configure the theme correctly, so I would prefer the following:
  
Is it possible to just set a different theme for 'vterm' vs have a different theme for 'Org Mode' etc?
  
​
 Thanks!

 A file contains the original TODO subtree, and I want to display that subtree in the buffer of B in a particular place. When the task is over, for example, if I was to change the state to 'DONE', I would like the changes to be reflected to the buffer of B file. How should I go about this?
 Maybe a better explanation would be this: I want to reference a subtree from another file, where the changes I make on one would be reflected on the other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've wanted to have a reason to do Haskell for some time now, the type system and guarantees are just too good. I have used some Haskell-like languages and I liked it. I also prefer functional programming to others. However, I came to realize, having a dynamic type system is a headache and missed type guarantees. 
 So now, I want to try to give Haskell a try. I read a little on DataHaskell, but not sure yet.
 I just want a language that can replace python as my exploration language. I mainly use the jax (functional-style) library anyway. I'm not going to do big neural networks (I plan to use another language for that case), and my interest lies in small machine learning scales (think of toy problems).
 With this, is haskell okay for this? 
 Further background: I have been trying languages here and there (for varying purposes) and I usually go back to a non-functional language just because of the lack of libraries or development or !documentation (Elm, ML-based languages, etc).
 Maybe Haskell, being very rich in types... can it type check matrix types(shapes) (or can I write them my own)?

 I struggled to find some resources on the subject, so I'm looking for help.
 In org-mode, i would like to export in pdf a document with and without headlines tagged differently in two or more separated files.
 For example, if we considered this file, named a_dumb_example.org :
  
# Headline one :foo: 
 Some contents 
 # Headline two :bar: 
 Another contents
  
I would like to export it in two files :
  
a_dumb_example_foo.pdf : containing only the contents of the first headline
 a_dumb_example_bar.pdf : containing only the contents of the second headline
  
It's seemed like you can do almost anything with elisp, but i can't manage to find anything. Theses days, as I mentioned in another post (https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/10fyjyc/comment/j5edzha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I do everything this manually, but I want to speed up the process. 
 Any hints ?

 #+TODO: TASK | IN-PROGRESS | IN-REVIEW | DONE 
 But I want some subtrees to have different TODO sequences/keywords, so they would be scoped to a subtree.
 One way I found was to set the sequences I'd use in the document like this:
 #+TODO: TASK | IN-PROGRESS | IN-REVIEW | DONE #+TODO: TODO | DONE 
 This way the TODOs would have both sequences, but maybe there's a better way to achieve that?
 Ideally, it would be a property where I could set the steps/keywords there, like I can do with :LOGGING: so I would avoid cycling the wrong sequence in the subtrees.

 Does anyone have an idea what is causing this? I know this is a type error, but I do not understand what could be causing it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs newbie here, be gentle. I'm rewriting my config and trying to keep packages to a minimum. Since I want to use emacs as an IDE, I want to install eglot for the LSP client and company to have a better completion UI. I went with eglot over lsp mode because I have previously used lsp mode and it seemed slow. Plus, eglot is shipping with emacs 29 by default, which means it is good enough to be included in emacs, so I might as well use it.
 Anyway, I do the typical thing. M-x package-install RET eglot RET. Gets installed from elpa as expected. Same with company: M-x package-install RET company RET. They both work, all is good, but upon restarting, they're not longer there.
 After some head scratching I realized they are not being initialized. After running package-initialize they both work again. If I add that same function to the end of my init.el, then it works. But why? The package-enable-at-startup variable is set to true, as it should.
 Here's my config, it's not very big.
 Also as an extra. Anyway to move the eln-cache folder? Thanks.
 EDIT: I know the packages.el file isn't being loaded. That's fine, I'm not done with it yet. I have installed the packages manually with the built-in package manager.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure many people are familiar with Li Haoyi's excellent article, "Benchmarking Scala Collections," which can be found at https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BenchmarkingScalaCollections.html. However, the article was written six years ago for Scala 2.11 and an unspecified version of the JDK. Time flies so fast! Regardless, I have taken the time to update the old benchmark to Scala 3, added some new tests, and run it on Scala 3.2.2 and JDK 19.0.1.
 Here are results: https://gist.github.com/scf37/36a86427697bcf1fdae161edbc2bb2c9
 Some conclusions:
 - mutable.Map and mutable.Set are no slower than their immutable counterparts on all operations
 - Lookups on immutable Maps/Sets are 5 times slower
 - foreach is good enough on Scala collections but is horrible on arrays
 - Vector lookup performance is much closer to HashMap than to mutable.Buffer
 - mutable collections are as fast as their Java counterparts

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Left folds are by default defined via right folds in base, because this way left folds play better with fusion as explained in the Call Arity paper:
  
Call Arity was devised mainly to allow for a fusing foldl, i.e. a definition of foldl in terms of foldr that takes part in list fusion while still producing good code.
  
E.g. the default definition of Data.Foldable.foldl' is 
 foldl' :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b foldl' f z0 xs = foldr f' id xs z0 where f' x k z = k $! f z x 
 On the other hand the default definition of Data.Foldable.foldl1 is this:
 foldl1 :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> a) -> t a -> a foldl1 f xs = fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace "foldl1: empty structure") (foldl mf Nothing xs) where mf m y = Just (case m of Nothing -> y Just x -> f x y) 
 Why not something like
 foldl1 :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> a) -> t a -> a foldl1 f xs = foldr step (const id) xs (const id) $ errorWithoutStackTrace "foldl1: empty structure" where step x k f' z = k f (f' z x) {-# INLINE step #-} {-# INLINE foldl1 #-} 
 ? The latter seems like it would play much better with fusion. I didn't check, but perhaps it's more efficient too? Both versions generalize trivially to foldl1', which would be great to add to base if only to define maximumBy and minimumBy in terms of it. Those are currently defined as
 maximumBy :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> Ordering) -> t a -> a maximumBy cmp = fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace "maximumBy: empty structure") . foldl' max' Nothing where max' mx y = Just $! case mx of Nothing -> y Just x -> case cmp x y of GT -> x _ -> y {-# INLINEABLE maximumBy #-} minimumBy :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> Ordering) -> t a -> a minimumBy cmp = fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace "minimumBy: empty structure") . foldl' min' Nothing where min' mx y = Just $! case mx of Nothing -> y Just x -> case cmp x y of GT -> y _ -> x {-# INLINEABLE minimumBy #-} 
 Or am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had done some search here and on the internet, finding some talks, articles resources such as [1][2][3][4]. While they are good, somehow I feel something is missing based on my current level - a person who has experience and works on Scala projects, but still feels himself lacking of "something" or advance knowledge.
 For instance, [1] is nice which helps me get started in understanding the differences between OOP and FP when applying related concepts. [2] is also good that points out some usages that I was not aware of like case class's copy. [3] and [4] are probably the resources that are closest to my expectation because I am looking for materials that I don't need to rely on third party library, and can build/ design the artifact of my own after learning; however, [3] seemingly is not finished while [4] looks like a starting point.
 So I would like to know if any recommended resources (doc, links, videos, and so on) of such topics that fill in this gap? Or diving the library such as cats is the only way to go? I appreciate any suggestions, and commentary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got a message from Tarsius because I'm sponsoring him. This is what it says:
 "Recently GitHub announced that GitHub Sponsors is going to abruptly stop accepting PayPal payments on February 23, 2023.
 "In the three days since, I have already lost a dozen sponsors. If this continues at this rate, I am going to loose over half my sponsors on this platform.
 "This is a huge issue for me. These donations are not just a nice extra but how I make a living. I already have to get by with an income that is way below minimal wage, so losing sponsors in great numbers really hurts. I receive about 80% of all donations through Github Sponsors, losing between 50% and 75% of that, would mean I cannot pay my bills anymore.
 "If you are currently using PayPal, then please take some time to switch to another payment method, either here on GitHub, or by using one of the many other options donation options."
  
My personal opinion as a professional developer and one among many donators is that I couldn't survive my work without the help of Magit. It allows me to be really effective and to find new Git tricks.
 If you are using Paypal as a payment method in Github, please switch to another way of donating. And if you're not donating, this would be a great time to start.
 Donate to Magit!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I watched a talk by Tony Buzan at Poland's SWPS University, which I came across on YouTube, reminding me of the importance of colour in understanding and recall.
Whilst at school several decades ago, I became very keen on Tony Buzan's methods popularised by his 1974 BBC television series Use Your Head, in which he encouraged people to use colourful mindmaps and speedreading, among other techniques, to better understand and remember anything they were studying.  At the time, I was a failing student.  So, even though most students and staff saw his techniques as weird, I decided to give them ago.  To my astonishment, by applying just a couple of his key techniques, I quickly started getting top marks and with less effort.  So, I have no doubt Tony's methods have merit.
It would therefore be beneficial to introduce coloured text into The Archive app by using some simple markup code.
Even a limited pallet would be helpful, perhaps just red, green and blue, although the more colours, the better.  Something like <r>for red text</r>, <b>for blue text</b>, etc., would be enough.  But hex codes would allow for a more extensive pallet.
Would coloured text in The Archive app be possible?
Tony Buzan's talk at SWPS University can be seen here:  https://youtu.be/QEokHNWf-Qg.
And his 1974 BBC television series Use Your Head, is available here: https://youtu.be/EgG8GuQHHIs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, the use-package documentation says that we should use the :init keyword to execute code before the package is loaded. In the use-package documentation, those are usually variables set before the package is loaded, but can be functions to enable a certain mode as well.
 However, I've noticed for example on the Vertico GitHub page, vertico-mode is enabled in :init but it works perfectly fine when enabled in :config as well. The package is not deferred so I don't see a reason to put vertico-mode within :init.
 There are situations when using :init makes sense because the package is deferred. For example :bind automatically defers a package.
 (use-package ef-themes :init (load-theme 'ef-summer t) :bind ("<f9>" . ef-themes-select)) 
 If I wouldn't use :init in this situation, the theme wouldn't load until F9 is pressed.
 Please correct me if I'm wrong. Also, is it true that overusing :init can cause Emacs to start a little slower? I've seen it mentioned by someone here on Reddit, but I don't have the link anymore.

 They work as expected with other applications. In particular Firefox is fine, my terminal (kitty) and OpenOffice Writer are all fine too.
 However under emacs from time-to-time the characters will become extremely squashed together, overlap and have minimal character width.
 This happens with all of those fonts, although I've found Fira Code to be more volatile than the others. I'm using Mickey Petersen's ligature package with the following configuration:

I know of psedudocode-mode (although I do not know if this can be used in an org file), but the idea would be to do something similar to that. Any guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.

 The functionality has been realised with a slightly modified version of org-extra-emphasise to use less intrucive emphasize symbols then in the unmodified version and hydra to get the pop up menu.

 In my humble opinion, the design of NANO Emacs by u/Nicolas-Rougier is probably the best one out there. However, I could never really use NANO Emacs because I require Doom Emacs, which, on the other hand, has the best configuration framework :)
 Hence, I decided to port the NANO modeline and themes for Doom Emacs. The former is adapted to display information about the Evil state. The latter uses the Doom themes framework, making everything work out-of-the-box in Doom Emacs.
 If you want to try, those are the repository:
 https://github.com/ronisbr/doom-nano-themes
 https://github.com/ronisbr/doom-nano-modeline
 These are works in progress and probably have many bugs and inconsistencies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am happy to announce the latest release of the Generic-Persistence library!
 A few weeks back I wrote a blog post about my initial ideas for a Haskell persistence layer that uses generics.
 I got positive feedback and some very useful hints. In the meantime, I have been busy and have been able to implement almost all of the suggestions.
 Of course the library is still in an early stage of development. But all test cases are green and it should be ready for early adopters use. 
 Several things are still missing:
  
A query language
 Handling auto-incrementing primary keys
 coding free support for 1:1 and 1:n relationships (using more generics magic)
 schema migration
 ...
  
Feature requests, feedback and pull requests are most welcome!
 The library is available on Hackage:
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-persistence

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I'm really, really excited to announce the release of Ogma 1.0.7!
 Ogma is a NASA tool that facilitates integrating runtime monitors or runtime verification applications into other systems. Ogma extends Copilot [1], a high-level runtime verification framework that generates hard real-time code.
 In spite of the small increase in the version number, the feature included in this version is big: we now generate monitors for Robot Operating System (ROS 2) applications.
 Use cases supported by Ogma also include generating monitors directly from requirements specified using a structure natural language framework, and producing NASA Core Flight System (cFS) monitoring applications.
 For more details, including videos of monitors being generated and flown in simulators, see: https://github.com/nasa/ogma
 Monitors generated from natural-language requirements using Ogma, running inside X-Plane Flight simulator.
 Releases
 Ogma is released as a collection of packages in Hackage. The entry point is https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ogma-cli.
 Code
 The github repo is located at: https://github.com/nasa/ogma.
 What's coming
 The next release is planned for March 21st, 2023.
 Ogma is currently undergoing the qualification process necessary for NASA Class D Software. Apart from the changes required by that process, we also have the following in our roadmap:
  
Extend ROS 2 monitors with further information about sources of violations.
 Add tests to generated code.
 Simplify NASA cFS monitor generation process.
  
Happy Haskelling!
 Ivan

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Org-attach is very useful for embedding images and other files into org headings, especially with the ID flavor, which makes attachment painless. But the hard-coded attachment directory locations creates the real potential for the links to go stale. I think a couple of small additions would go a long way towards hardening org-attach against eventual "stale ID link syndrome": 
  
It would be very useful to be able to specify the org-attach-id-dir as a file-level setting, ala #+ATTACH-ID-DIR or similar. This would allow you to keep "separate stores" of id-based attachments, so you could move them around. You could do this with a relative path for org-attach-id-dir (though see below), but maybe for some documents you want all their attachments in a fixed location (e.g. ~/org/.attachments) but for others you want them "packaged together" for portability. Maybe this is already possible? The org docs don't seem to have a single place documenting all the #+CONFIG: val settings that can appear at the top of the file. 
 
Another related wish which I don't think is yet possible: an option to set org-attach-id-dir based on a locate-dominating-file search. So you could have a structure as below, and all the note's attachments would be stored and live in the top .attachments/ directory. Then you could happily move portable_dir around, send it to colleagues, etc., and attachment links would never go stale.
 
 ​
  portable_dir/ .attachments/ path1/ notes1.org notes2.org subpath1_1/ subnotes1.org path2/ notes_other.org

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have tried to shift a chunk of my online media consumption to elfeed, so that I can quickly check out blog posts, webcomics, arXiv papers, podcasts and YouTube videos. However, this has meant that updating my feeds has become quite resource intensive, and runs for a few minutes.
  
 My current setup involves 60+ feeds, 20 of which are podcasts and 10 of which are YouTube channels and playlists.
 Playing around with my settings, I now use 
  (elfeed-set-timeout 90) (setq url-queue-timeout 5) (setq elfeed-curl-max-connections 8) 
 and elfeed-search-fetch takes about 5 minutes to run, at about 25% CPU usage across my 4-core i7. I've have the elfeed timeout at 90 seconds as otherwise some feeds simply time out when I try to update them.
 Is there anyway to speed this up, or do I just have far too many feeds (some of which only update e.g. every month)?
  
 One course of action I do is to go to a particular filter setting (which I have stored as a bookmark and access via a shortcut) and do elfeed-search-fetch-visible. I do this for feeds tagged as podcasts for instance, which I check more often than blog posts.
 An alternative that I haven't started working on yet is to write something that updates some subset of feeds. I use elfeed-org to manage my list of feeds and their tags, so perhaps there's an elegant solution that ties that package into a new fetch function.

 Usecase: I wanted to take the contents of description lists in a consistent format, have them export normally and use an export filter to parse up the list's content for input into a program. After trying numerous export filters (https://orgmode.org/manual/Advanced-Export-Configuration.html), the common ones weren't satisfying as they lost formatting on export or would've caused me to write a significantly more error-prone filter than I wanted.
 The solution: wrap each section in a special block (https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-blocks-in-LaTeX-export.html) so you keep formatting and can group all the text together.
 Relevant aside: my usecase would've been trivial if either of orgmode supported either of the following:
  
multiline table cells in the default table type.
 a way to feed table.el tables to src blocks as a parameter.

 I have been exporting an org-mode manuscript via `ox-pandoc` with good results, but now I need to produce Word 'comments' from my org source. Pandoc understands these comments, so running pandoc on a `markdown` buffer using HTML syntax like this works
 <span class="comment-start" id="3" author="jdm204" date="NOW">comment</span> This is the text that is commented on. <span class="comment-end" id=3"></span> 
 but the same syntax in an org document naturally just inserts the HTML source into the document.
 I've also tried `#+begin_export pandoc` block, but that also just inserts the raw source. 
 It seems like pandoc needs something that it understands as org syntax but I'm stumped.
 Does anyone have any idea if or how this could be achieved?

 On some of my computers, this might be symlinked to another directory that I may have, say, on a zfs drive. 
 Problem is, Emacs changes the symlink to the canonical form, so when I pull the configuration to another computer, it goes to the wrong place!
 How do I tell Emacs to retain the paths as they are and not go to the canonical versions? After all, I put thoes symlinks there for a reason!

 I read a book and it has examples in Pascal, thus I want to create Pascal snippets.
 Installed FreePascal and it seems like Emacs has a pascal-mode but there is no babel function for it.
 So when I have
 #+begin_src pascal
 #+end_src
 It will not work.
 Any idea? It seems like one has to define the org-babel stuff to trigger the pascal compilation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently I am using org roam to manage my knowledge base and add notes from my laptop. But I am now thinking of transitioning my note taking on a tablet or iPad where I can type and draw to take notes. But unfortunately I can't use emacs on this and converting my notes is also a hassle. I was looking at other posts comparing emacs to obsidian and logseq, but they always go on tangents and talk about how emacs can do so much more rather than simply focusing on the note taking aspect between emacs and the other applications. So I am uncertain about emacs capabilities just for note taking with tablets and iPads. I was wondering if anyone uses a tablet for their note taking and how they integrate it quickly into their org roam? Or is this best left for obsidian which has an app on the tablet?
 Currently I'm thinking I take notes in obsidian in tablet/iPad which automatically syncs to my computer where I have a script running to convert it to org. This seems like the fastest and most efficient way of doing things

Vertico and icomplete-vertical seem very similar on the surface: they both give a vertical completion system that uses Emacs's built-in completing-read, meaning they are both compatible with things like Marginalia and Orderless. icomplete-vertical ships with Emacs, while Vertico is a third-party package. So my question is: why would I use Vertico instead of icomplete-vertical, when they seem to offer basically the same features?

Does anyone know how to do this? I am using pdf tools. Thanks.

 The awesome part is that building buffers out of an easy-to-select storage (something MANY hate in this community) is damn effective: text is easy to read but not easy to combine on the fly and that's an issue no files&dirs text tools can solve, org-ql, org-transclusion are excellent examples of very good tools who can't give the same outcome of spit out text from a backend DB.
 The not-so-exiting part is that while notes can be org-mode, they are not actually real org-mode, yes, they got rendered, but I still can't manage attachments properly, use a drawer as in org-mode and so on.
 My dream? Simply a note-taking solution that allow FULL Emacs/org-mode features but out of a flexible solution that allow dynamic result buffers out of queries, like notmuch/mu for emails, like ekg for notes and so on, because while text is super flexible is still also limiting in some aspects.
 The purpose of this post is reiterate this long running not so accepted but definitively felt topic on notes seeing the regular evolution of tools who try to be kind-of query-driven (like search&narrow vs menus/taxonomies) and periodically fail to complete the game. I hope a day enough people would accept such storage concept and we will finally see an Emacs-based storage who is actually a kind of DB directly managed in Emacs, with of the flexibility of a DB and the power of elisp. Oh, and I hope to be clear in this quick description as well!

 I would like to believe it is safe as it is under a reputed repo which is emacs-tree-sitter which recently had tree-sitter merged into main line emacs. 
 Is they any particular reason it is not on public package repos?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a moment ago, I was working on some statistics homework. And it was all just boring rote confidence interval calculations. Mostly busy work. After doing about two problems, I wasn't satisfied with the pace at which I was completing the homework, so I fired up GHCi in my terminal. In theory, what I am describing here can be done with any language with a REPL, but Haskell's syntax makes for extremely fast prototyping (in my opinion).
 First I created a function that would map some common confidence intervals to it's corresponding z-score. I.e. 0.9 -> 1.645. Took 10 seconds.
 Next I created a function that would take some sample mean as an argument, number of samples, and variance as an argument and it would return a function which, when given a z-score, will return a tuple that represents my confidence interval. 
 Next, plug and chug. A homework that could have taken me an hour and a half took me 15 minutes. Next step is to integrate it with LaTeX so it will automatically write out the answers for me :) 
 Maybe this is a trivial example but I was just really impressed with the ease and speed with which I could quickly slap together a "custom" calculator and start plugging in the values I care about.

However, when I do not write \end{document} into the same codeblock, Emacs appears to not accept the codeblocks end #+end_src and throws an error on running org-babel-tangle. If I include an additional \end{document} in the first codeblock, all LaTeX codeblocks in my orgfile are recognised as such on tangling and correctly exported. Then, however, I have to go into the generated TeX-file and delete the superfluous \end{document} from the export of the first block manually. That does not feel right.
 Is there an elegant solution to that problem? In particular, how may I allow a codeblock to be exported properly by org-babel-tangle, even if it contains environments that are not properly closed in the same codeblock?
 PS: As far as I understood from a simple web search, org-export does not deliver what I want without additional setup, as I basically want to write a LaTeX file and manage the org stuff around it without exporting it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came across this interesting discussion at the bottom of the Let vs Where article: Problems with Where. I couldn't understand for a bit just how these two functions had different runtime behaviours:
 -- Supposedly fast fib = (map fib' [0 ..] !!) where fib' 0 = 0 fib' 1 = 1 fib' n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2) 
 -- Supposedly "considerably slower"??? fib x = map fib' [0 ..] !! x where fib' 0 = 0 fib' 1 = 1 fib' n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2) 
 These fib implementations come from a 2010 mailing list: https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2010-October/084538.html.
 So I spent a while reading through the discussion, and also reading about floating names, and also trying to understand under what conditions the full-laziness optimisation could help.

 When I create the dblock to capture the column view, it works fine. ```
 +BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id global :max-level 3
 ...
 +END:
 ``` Following this page: https://orgmode.org/manual/Capturing-column-view.html.
 But when I try to add a filter using match or exclude-tags, it doesn't create the table, and instead shows the column view as if calling org-columns on the entire file.
 ```org
 +BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id global :max-level 3 :match "+DEADLINE={.+}+SCHEDULED={.+}-repeat/!-DONE-CANCELLED"
 ```
 What's funny is that it was working before, and I have a filtered table, but now it doesn't want to function properly. 
 Any advice?
 EDIT:
 Looks like this bit +DEADLINE={.+}+SCHEDULED={.+} is the cause of the issue.
 Anyone knows how to achieve this filter?

 I'm working on this, because it seems somewhat trivial. Initial feedback, obviously, has been negative, and I guess the package needs a parser to convert existing .hs files to use the clearly idiom instead.
 ​
 The intended use is to make Haskell readable for newbies, when I think everyone reading this is at the level wherein, excepting maybe `timesDo`, none of the functions are necessary.
 ​
 
 ​
 And to be totally honest, this is 100% a clone of Flow, taylorfausak's extremely popular (sarcasm) operator library, except deliberately using semi-verbose function names instead with declarative programming / readability being the aim.

Thought for the week
In the classic Greek sense, we should make more time in our lives for leisure. Slow productivity is a combination of incremental work and tangential work. It is incremental because it is made of micro-actions accumulating over time. Tangential, in the sense that it sometimes is work or play that seems unrelated but actually moves the needle forward. A walk in the woods might be an example of tangential productivity.
Writing has taken priority. My course assignment is to write a creative non-fiction essay modeled after the works we discussed in class. My Zk has been a joyous and surprising resource for ideas. I'm using my ZK by creating search queries and using the highlighting feature to find where I've already written answers to the query in my own voice. They become snippets directly into my essay. In a sense, I've already written my essay. I just have to find all the pieces and put them together. In truth, this is only a first draft and still needs work.
What I've found to be key steps to creating a rough draft.
—
My review routine has again surfaced something wonderful in my ZK. I had no idea I was curating ideas on the value of practice. I started a secondary hub with 18 entries, hung off of the main hub titled The Art Of Living A Good Life [[202105102006]]. 

  
Basic learning preps. What am I doing that is practice? How else do I expect to improve unless I practice? The best continue practicing even after achieving success to push themselves, not become complacent, and reach new heights. Practice Different - by Stephen Vafier - Carolina Stories

 ​
 ```
 A monad in programming is made up of three parts, also known as the three laws of monads:
  
Unit (also known as "return" or "pure"): This is the function that wraps a value into a monadic context. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy who rounds up a calf and brings it into the corral.
 Bind (also known as "flatMap" or "chain"): This is the function that applies a function to a monad and returns a new monad. It allows you to chain operations on the monad. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy who takes a calf from the corral to the branding iron, then from the branding iron to the castrator, and so on.
 Associativity: This is the law that says the order in which you chain the operations with the bind function should not matter. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy code that says you should always ride in the direction of your destination, no matter what order you do your chores in.
  
Together, these three parts make up the monad. In cowboy terms, you might think of it like a group of cowboys who work together to round up and process cattle. Each cowboy has a specific job to do, and they follow a set of rules to make sure they get the job done right.

 this means that I can't ctrl+click on anything and get no type information by hovering over functions.
 how would I approach solving this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just to get this out of the way, this is obviously not a criticism in any facet, I know people develop org-roam, and much else, in their free time. It is what it is, in any case. But before I consider using the software, I want to get a realistic idea of what's going on in a descriptive sense, without judgement. It seems on a superficial view that the project has slowed down quite significantly. The latest release was in April of 2022, currently open bugs seem to be fixed or even considered at a very slow pace, whereas in the past a lot of bugs have been closed swiftly.
 Has org-roam simply reached a state of maturity, where the main functionality works fine and is stable, such that everything else is either details or some minor stuff that's hard to fix? Or has development and improvement stalled involuntarily because the maintainers don't have a lot of free time to put into the project? Any insight is welcome.

 All the advanced and experimental features are now hidden behind the --power launcher option, as was already the case for the scala distribution for a while. This includes things like package, publish and others. So to package something, you'll now have to :
 scala-cli --power package . 
 Of course, the power mode can also be set globally.
 scala-cli config power true 
 Other notable changes include:
  
support for script inputs with no file extension via the shebang sub-command
 support for JSON exports of project configuration
 dropping ammonite imports syntax
 improving the readability of individual sub-commands' --help and --full-help outputs
 and more, refer to the release notes for details

 Apparently this course lectures are "published" every week since the 30th January 2023 and will end up with 17 Lectures (currently 8 are available)
 This course was already completely available in 2021 and 2022.
 But every year he removes the videos "I'll be releasing the videos week by week as my class for Nottingham students progresses. They are the same videos as previously with some minor updates."
 The YouTube videos are either one or two years old so i just think he unlists them. Even the lectures slides are already available A few people had the same problem last year So I wanted to ask if someone knows where the lectures are still hosted? I really prefer this course over the other introduction resources, but I only have the next week off so I want to watch them soon.

To obviate this problem I have to go back and copy directly to the register. This has been a long standing problem for me in Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I've recently tried out Emacs and enjoyed it a lot, but I can't seem to get my color scheme working, no matter the many different methods I use.Before, in Vim, I set it to use my terminal(st) colors, and I was very happy with that. A picture of what a .cpp file looks like is below.
 https://i.imgur.com/C3R6Ikv.png
 I use Emacs Gui mode, and I was looking to use these terminal colors, but I can't find a way to port the Vim colors over(even though they are terminal colors). I've tried creating my own Emacs color scheme(using autothemer), but the lack of faces for some things prevent me from fully creating the theme, and my lack of knowledge about Emacs Lisp is hindering me as well.
 I'm not sure how st(suckless terminal) and/or Vim uses the colors specified in the st config, but I think it is Xresources-related. Below is a picture of the 16 colors I use in my st config.
 I am considering porting this over to Vim(as these seem to be somewhat general) and then to Emacs, but again, I have no idea how these colors are used and applied.
 https://i.imgur.com/FAEcuer.png
 (I can't remember when I made the theme, but I believe it was based on something online, but I'm not sure how prevalent it is)
 In the end, any pointers on how to implement this theme in Emacs or anything about the way st uses these colors will help greatly(or any other places I should cross-post this in). Once I figure out how to use this color scheme in Emacs in beyond, I plan on releasing it or such, as I think many might find it interesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious about using org-mode for language learning (currently working on Spanish, German, and French). Particularly, I'm trying to build up vocabulary as well as try my hand at reading / translating.
 In the past, when I was translating, I worked in a cryptpad and just wrote the translation in another text color and then went back to make corrections in yet another color. It was pretty time consuming. I've used org-remark for annotations on text and think it would be a good tool for this purpose. But maybe others have experience and suggestions for other tools or workflows.
 As for vocabulary, I think I'd like to do spaced repetition flashcards. I had used Anki for awhile, but it eventually got overwhelming. I couldn't really make a habit out of it.
 I haven't used any flashcard tools in org yet. Preferably I'd like something easy to use. I'm also wondering how to get vocab lists into org. It might be educational to do it by hand but I would prefer an automated solution, especially since I'm looking for "top 1000+ common words" lists. For example, taking an Anki set and converting to org. 
 Any suggestions and tips are appreciated.

Just "Vertico" doesn't tell the whole story, while "Vertico + Orderless + Embark + Consult + Marginalia" is quite a mouthful.
 For example the way this question is phrased, the technically correct the answer would be "little to none". Vertico itself offers no feature parity with the aforementioned alternatives. The answer the OP actually expects is about the advantages of the whole stack, but that increases the friction as it requires convincing everyone interested that each part of the stack is worthwhile (and often just plainly needed), even though originally they only planned on using Vertico.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assuming there is no way to configure a bidirectional sync with external softwares like rclone, would it be possible to access remote files using TRAMP but also guarantee some functionalities when the device is offline? 
 For example: the device is offline but I asked to access a file on a WebDAV server. Emacs already showed me that file previously so it shows me a cached copy of that file.
 Another example for writing: I'd like to write on a file using TRAMP. The device is offline, so Emacs will store this modified file for later and save it whenever it is possible.
 This is basically synchronization but done on Emacs, i guess. Is it possible?
 EDIT: Logseq, a famous notetaking app, has implemented an interesting sync mechanism that tells you if a file has been synced or not. Can someone like this be made in Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been an org-mode as my organisation tool, and emacs as my "OS" as a "beginner" for 2+ years. I happily use Org to do some GTD-alike organisation, and to collect my thoughts on topics in Org-Roam.
 **tldr;** I'm trying to dynamically generate org-headings for each (new) subdir of a directory. I think a shell script is the best way to achieve this (so it can run independently of an open emacs session) - but may be wrong. In any event I don't script very often and am very confused.
 *What I'm trying to do:*
 I edit video for fun. 
 I use syncthing to sync my scratch (editing) folder and my org-files across two machines:
  
my old i7 machine (effects and rendering); and 
 my dual boot surface go (basic and on-the-go editing, footage ingestion etc).
  
I work on my org-files in DooM emacs on those machines and orgzly / logseq (for roam) on my android phone (occasionally using termux too, but not if I can help it).
 My video editing software creates a folder for each video project. As a result I have a folder structure like `~/scratch/live_projects/video_X`
 I'm getting to the stage where I need to use notes in org-mode to keep track of various aspects of videos (scripts, b-roll, assets etc).
 It would be lovely if each time I create a project (and a directory is generated) it would pop a heading into my org-file where I could keep notes. 
 *What I've done so far:*
 I've managed to manipulate an org-file checklist using shell scripting in Tasker (on my phone). Mostly just checking / unchecking boxes via a menu. E.g. using sed to replace `/]` with `X]`.
 I'm struggling to google how to interact with directories in bash:
  
When I google the answer to this as keywords Org and Directory together get me lots of hits. 
 Maybe I need a better boolean search fu - but that is a different question.
 
 I also use fish, so when I test I hit `$(...) is not supported`. 
  
So as you can see, not much progress has been made.
 Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I started to transcribe my mother's old recipes written on 3×5" note cards into a digital format. Portability is important to me, as I wanted to be able to send them to friends and family and not have to worry about apps needed to view them. I initially opted to write them in Markdown. Then I became an Emacs user. 🤩 I like the idea of being able to write the recipes in org files and exporting to whatever format convenient for family, like perhaps PDF. Hosting a little website for them might be a neat project for a future date.
 ​
 I installed org-chef, but as far as I can tell, it's meant for scraping recipes from websites. I don't need functionality to adjust proportions, either. Being able to generate a shopping list might be useful someday, but it's not currently something I need to do. I've written a few recipe files in org-mode, but I'm not sure if this is the mode I should be using. I also experimented with using markdown-mode, but wouldn't it be better to write in another mode and export to Markdown? I'd prefer to have the recipes in separate files, rather than one big file, but I'm open to good reasons why I might not want to do that.
 ​
 I'm currently writing them with a few keywords and some tags for metadata. I searched a lot online, here on reddit, as well as asked ChatGPT (it worked well till it gave me a bunch of what seems to be incorrect advice 🫠), about how to create a basic template, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do it on my own. I'm currently using a file that I fill my stuff into and then save with a new name. That works well enough, but it seems to me like there'd be a more elegant way to do it.
 ​
 So, that's where I'm at. Part of me is starting to wonder if I should instead try to learn some database software for this... Though I really only want to be able to search for titles and basic tags, so a database sounds like overkill. Any advice and direction pointing is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/emacs!
 I would like to share with you my humble project - library for creating and managing tray icons Emacs-Appindicator.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/yn9vdccnqkja1.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=b90dfa4f2e477d10b79ec7751d0a8a8e430e9217
 ​
 You can hide/show icons, labels, create context menus with lisp callbacks for each menu item. The library uses svg-lib so you can use icons from various online collections supported by it. Under the hood it has tiny daemon, written in C that interacts with system tray via libappindicator. So, at least for now, the only supported OS is Linux.
 I planned to keep minor modes in separate repo - Emacs Appindicator Modes. For now there is only icon for pomm.el , but I plan to add more useful packages soon.
 I will be glad to hear your thoughts about package. Also I suppose it is the good time to change something in api, so if you have any idea - please share it!

 I want to use some of my org-roam files like a “database” (not in the strict sense), to keep some metadata about my files. 
 In this spirit, I want to save in the PROPERTIES drawer some information, which I want to put it in a table. My idea is to do the same process with several files and copy/paste those small tables into another (a large one) with all this information. 
 The problem with this approach is the visibility and navigation around the tables.

 What I have tried:
  
open the submodule transient with o
 specify the --recursive infix with r
 sync all submodules with c-u s
 init all submodules with c-u p
 update all submodules with c-u u
  
This effectively does the same as the git submodule update --init --recursive, but requires 3 separate commands, each with a prefix argument.
 I'm looking for a way to create another entry in the submodule transient (under the "All modules actions" section) to run git submodule update --init --recursive. If that can't be done, is there a way to more easily run all three commands (sync, init, update)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! 
 I'm a beginner in emacs configuration. Please excuse me if the answer here is obvious, but I am unable to find the solution online :/ I am having trouble configuring org-roam-dailies. I want each daily note to be pre-populated with the contents of a template file. My current configuration is as follows: 
 ```elisp
 (defun note-path (subpath) (let ((note-directory "/Users/<MY_USERNAME>/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/notes")) (file-truename (concat note-directory subpath))))
 (defun org-template (filename) (note-path (concat "/templates/" filename)))
 (use-package org :ensure t)
 (use-package org-roam :ensure t :config (setq org-roam-db-update-on-save t) (setq org-roam-directory (note-path "/")) (setq org-roam-dailies-directory "") (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates '(("d" "default" entry (org-template "daily-note.org") :target (file+head "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n")))))
 ```
 My issue specifically is with the last statement: setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates. I expect this to read the content of daily-note.org and create a new note with this as the content. However, it simply creates an empty note. I have ensured that the value of (org-template "daily-note.org") is correct; substituting it for an absolute path (e.g. ~/test.org) behaves the same way. 
 Are any of you kind people able to see where I'm misunderstanding?
 EDIT: fixed code formatting

 From my experiments it seems to have to do with the filename. I have a bunch of identical files containing some c++ code:
 [~] $ cat importfromdesktop.cpp #include <iostream> int main() { return 0; } [~] $ md5sum *.cpp 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromdesktop.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromdeskto.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromdesk.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromd.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfrom.cpp # WORKS! 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfro.cpp # WORKS! 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfr.cpp # WORKS! 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 fromdesktop.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 verylongfilenamehereman.cpp # WORKS! 
 When opening the first importfromdesktop.cpp, c++-mode is not started (this was the original filename that was problematic, when I copied the file's contents to a main.cpp it worked, so I started testing the filename).
 I kept removing a letter from the end and starting from importfrom.cpp, c++-mode would engage. So I thought maybe it has to do with the filename length? But testing doesn't show that either.
 Nothing different shows in the messages buffer in all these cases. How do I debug this?
 Thanks!

Client defines orphan instance. If a package defines an orphan instance, it MUST depend on the minor version of the packages that define the data type and the type class to be backwards compatible.
  
I don't really understand why this is required. Can anyone understand this?

 Does anyone know if it is possible to "roll-up" (I can't think of a better word) TAGS in the columns view.
 ALLTAGS seems to "push tags down", or inherit tags, but I want to push them up (the way {+} or {:} will sum something.
 an e.g.
 org * Project ** Task 1 :tag1: ** Task 2 :tag1:tag2: ** Task 3 :tag3:  
 in column view could display as
 org | Project | :tag1:tag2:tag3: |

 The first point of its philosophy is to
  
 Revise the org format: simple, extensible, unambiguous. Will make you feel right at home. Alternate markup formats have several flaws, but the most notable one is the requirement for complex and slow parsers. What if we told you it's possible to alleviate those problems, all whilst keeping that familiar feel? Enter the .norg file format, whose specification can be found here. The cross between all the best things from org and the best things from markdown, revised and merged into one.

 I've implemented a small prototype of type-safe remote hot-code swapping using Arrow-based (or more accurately, Cartesian-category-based) state machines of type input -> state -> (state, output):
 https://github.com/stevana/hot-swapping-state-machines#hot-swapping-state-machines
 The readme is written a bit like a blog post and contains code for how hot-code swapping is done in Erlang, how it's done using the prototype, implementation details and a couple of ideas for possible extensions and refinements.
 I hope you find it interesting and I'd be curious to hear your thoughts!

I'm not sure what is happening, since using SPC h ' shows they have org-hide as face and only those in headings multiple of three have this issue. Any tips on how to find the cause of the problem?
 ​
 Some headings have their \"bullets\" showing wrongly
 org-hide-emphasis-markers does not change the situation. Even when using describe-char, it says the asterisks are being shown as just the background.
 ​
 describe-char of the two incorrect asterisks in each heading.
 Some things point towards emphasis markers, Only the headings which have a multiple of 3 asterisks suffer from this problem, the middle asterisk is higher than the other two (although no boldness is indicated by describe-char), the left one and the last one in the affected lines are a little closer to the middle one and not centered.
 I have no idea on how to pursuit this problem... any tips?

 left is typescript file, right is the eldoc buffer (it also shows the same way in the minibuffer)
 Is this expected? My eglot/eldoc configuration is essentially vanilla, just with these additions:

 If I would implement this naively, I would just keep a buffer with original text in latin alphabet, while only showing to user transliterated form.
 But I am asking because there is a chance something which does the job has already been implemented?

 I've been working on the ekg package, the Emacs Knowledge Graph. Simply put, it's a note-taking system, but also a system that can store lots of kinds of interlinked data, not just notes. Here's a few things at a glance to know about it:
  
Stores all data (including the note) in a sqlite database
 Uses a "triple" schema, which is a way to store a variety information as a graph favoring extensibility, ease of introspection, and two-way links between data, but not maximizing efficiency
 Uses tags instead of in-buffer links and backlinks, where tags can be multi-word
 Notes have no title, so in general small notes are easier in this system
 Designed to be easy to integrate with; so if you want to auto-generate notes when, say, you finish an org task, that's trivial to write

I will be able to code a standard HTML/CSS website that mostly works even on text-based browsers and Tor Browser without JS enabled. Users of text-based browsers will get graceful "<foo.jpg>" placeholders. To code this website, I will obviously use Haskell on the backend.
 If the user has JS enabled, I can have a link on the site that says "activate interactive JavaScript features (5 MB download)". It is IMHO incredibly disrespectful to activate this mode by default, shoving something down the user's throat he didn't ask for. (Maybe the user is running a slow computer, or e.g. Qubes with lack of nice GPU integration and prefers the simple site because it has all the needed info.)
 Once clicked, a nice download indicator now spins for half a second.
 Boom!!
 The JS parts are now live. Static JPG images (previously rendered on the server) have turned into interactive HTML canvases with websockets support. A text counter that previously required a website refresh is now updating live through websockets. And so on.
  
This is the way. This is the future. This is the only way to stop the web from becoming an increasingly ugly place. (If you don't get it - if you e.g. really believe the new Reddit is better than old.reddit - you're lost and beyond saving IMHO, sorry.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok so I have a bit of a mystery. On one of my computer's Emacs installs, if I type an ampersand it gets underlined and shows what I assume are completions in the modeline. Annoyingly, it completes them without confirmation. So if I type &ke it gets replaced with け. This is really annoying when typing &key in Common Lisp since it gets replaced with けy. And oddly, it only happens on one of my computers, despite me sharing my .emacs folder between my computers using a git repo.
 I have no idea what this is or how to turn it off. I can't find anything about it online, and I'm at a loss as to how to find it within emacs (helpful-key says the ampersand is a self-insert-command, and pressing C-h while the ampersand is underlined exits out of whatever this is).
 What do?

 Just to set appropriate expectations, this series is not about Scala--it's about binary search--so I've tried to make the code as readable as possible even to people who don't know Scala, which means that there's a lot of imperative loops. (But higher order functions do show up starting in Part 6.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm planning to set up an Emacs configuration for somebody writing books and stories who is not familiar with technology that much.
 There are nice looking distraction-free setups with https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode or https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti or https://github.com/joaotavora/darkroom or https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs
 However, as far as I've read (I haven't set up them except nano), they do not offer a very reduced and visually appealing recentf-open-file alternative.
 I'm thinking of a screen that pops up when booting Emacs that only shows the files I was working on recently in large font (maybe as buttons to click on). The file extension should be hidden, so that I may use it with Orgdown files that have long, descriptive file names (most probably within the same directory).
 Something like:
  
The Picture of Dorian Gray (that points to "The Picture of Dorian Gray.org")
 1984
 Notes about The Picture of Dorian Gray
 ....
  
Does that ring a bell for anybody here? Is there some similar functionality out there?
 Bonus for support for an easy to use file creation process like "add a new book", "add new notes", "add new short story" in combination with, e.g., a template mechanism. 
 Thanks

 ;; Add the Tempel Capf to `completion-at-point-functions'.
 ;; `tempel-expand' only triggers on exact matches. Alternatively use
 ;; `tempel-complete' if you want to see all matches, but then you
 ;; should also configure `tempel-trigger-prefix', such that Tempel
 ;; does not trigger too often when you don't expect it. NOTE: We add
 ;; `tempel-expand' *before* the main programming mode Capf, such

 (setq-local completion-at-point-functions
 (cons #'tempel-expand
 completion-at-point-functions)))
 ​
 (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'tempel-setup-capf)
 (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'tempel-setup-capf)
 (global-tempel-abbrev-mode))
 ```
 When i go into a prog-buffer the lsp-completion get to the top of the completion function and moves the tempel expand completion below lsp completions.
 I tried moving the prog-mode-hook to lsp-mode but the tempel expand still got added before lsp-completion-at-point

 All are collaped by default. And when i do counsel-org-goto AB
 it's shown as

 As you can see point 3 (last line in header) has 3 dots, and if i try to edit note after saving and reopening buffer eddits are scatered all over file outside AB header - basically they somehow placed in this 3 dots.

 It doesn't have any non-closed or wrongly nested tags, but the escaping isn't handled correctly.
 E.g. it has:
 <manufacturer>Procter&Gamble</manufacturer> 
 ... where the & symbol is not escaped correctly (thus "expected a semi-colon after the reference for entity" error).
 I don't control the companies generating those XMLs so I cannot influence the data quality or format at the source.
 Some of the files have![CDATA[ and proper escaping and some don't.
 I currently use xs4s.XML.loadString to parse it to scala.xml.Elem.
 I also tried to use ruippeixotog/scala-scraper to handle it as XHTML but some of the tags are <link> which are considered as empty tags by JSoup so it lost the data in them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have been using org mode for notes but I never used or understood the todo list features.
 Now I am trying to use org for todo lists, but having trouble fitting to my mental model. Maybe it can be configured, or you can tell me why my approach is wrong.
 What I tried is (foolowing tutorials) to make some tags HOME,WORK,then make some project topics in an outline like
 * TODAY ** TODO ask reddit // tag this with @HOME * TOMORROW ** TODO finish that thing * WEEK * SOMETIME * IMPORTANT ... 
 ​
 In this view, the tags are "where", and the list provides "what".I can easily move items from IMPORTANT to TODAY using C-c C-w.I can filter by home or work. Good so far.
 Now, I would like to see an adjenda view that shows at least the TODAY view, and hopefully a view of selected other categories. However, this requires assigning dates. I don't want to do that because dates do not mean much. In fact I rarely need to think about dates. I look at the calendar and note that something is due on "Wednesday", not caring about the date.
 a) my TODAY list is a "goal" not a contract. Some days I will make a list, then learn of an unexpected task will change everything, with no time to get back to the org mode undil end of day. And most days I find that I do not complete everything on TODAY's list. I want those uncompleted things to automatically carry over to tomorrow's version of "TODAY".
 b) I will use a calendar for things that have a particular associated time.
 c) I do not want to waste time deleting dates and adding new dates that mean little,or constantly moving tasks from one date to the next. Just leave them under TODAYuntil either they are done, or I move them to another category like SOMEDAY.
 In short, I think I do not want the calendar features for now, just a todo-list sorted by categories and with a configurable view and hot ckeys.
 Is this possible? Or, what _should_ I be doing?
 Thank you for your advice (and note that I really am a beginner).

 It doesn't have to be about moving notes from Apple notes to Org files. I believe the process would be similar for moving notes from words to Org as well.

 I went into some basic Scala material and now I am trying to solve Leetcode problems that I solved before using Python to get more used to Scala. The question I have is about the Two Sum problem. I am submitting the following solution and getting a compile error.
 ​
 object Solution { def twoSum(nums: Array[Int], target: Int): Array[Int] = { var res = Array[Int](2) var idxs = Array[Int](2) for ((num, index) <- nums.zipWithIndex) { var remainder = target - num if (remainder == num) { for (j <- 0 to (nums.length - 1)) { if (nums(j) == remainder) { // idxs += j idxs :+ j } if (idxs.length == 2) { return idxs } } } else if (nums.contains(remainder)) { // res += i res :+ index // res += nums.indexOf(remainder) res :+ nums.indexOf(remainder) } if (res.length == 2) { return res } } } } 
 The error
 Line 8: error: type mismatch; (in solution.scala) found : Unit required: Array[Int] for ((num, index) <- nums.zipWithIndex) { ^ 
 I don't understand why i am getting it. I understand that the return is not an Array as expected. However, both res and idxs are arrays. Any help will be appreciated, thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see compiler (and flymake) errors of this sort all the time. Consider the common pattern:
  
A.el - main code, requires and uses a.el.
 a.el - a “module” or component of a.el. Its only entry anywhere is via being required and used in A.el. Makes use of some of A.el's functions and variables.
  
How to handle this dependency to try to satisfy the compiler:
  
Non-solution: obviously you cannot (require 'a) in A.el and (require 'A) in a.el.
 Just forget about it and put a.el inside A.el. Leads to large and harder to maintain files.
 defvar nil and declare-function everything that the compiler complains about in a.el. I see this a lot. Ugly, hard to maintain.
 Just ignore the compiler warnings. Lots of people do this, alarms users, encourages ignoring linters.
 Factor out the bits of A.el you need in a.el into some A-common.el and require it in both places. Maintenance headache.
  
What I want is to tell the compiler: this feature will only be required in A.el, which is its parent. I do not require it, it requires me. Compile me after compiling my parent, and consider its symbols as fully available to me.
 Anybody have a better strategy?

 I'm realizing more and more that I prefer the flexibility of modal editing. That being said, I'm really enjoying the robustness of emacs in many other ways. I know evil mode exists, but I also don't want to just turn emacs into Vim, and it seems like evil swings too far in that direction.

 Basically, it’s just Evil-easymotion, purged of evil.
 My take: think of a movement command, like forward-word. Rather than repeating that command four times to go four words forward, you can turn that into a holymotion/easymotion, and press a single, home-row character, and jump straight there. For those familiar with Avy, it’s much the same(and uses avy under the hood), but generalized to work with any movement command, and the ability to restrict the scope of an avy motion to look only within some lisp object, like a buffer, a sentence, or a line. This will tend to give you short, usually one/two-character targets. In my…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is org-mode difficult to use on Microsoft Windows?
 Org-mode is a highly versatile and powerful tool for organizing notes, tasks, and documents. While it was originally developed for use with the Emacs text editor on Unix-based operating systems, it can be used on other platforms as well, including Microsoft Windows.
 However, using Org-mode on Windows can be more challenging than using it on other operating systems for several reasons:
 Emacs installation: Emacs, the text editor used to run Org-mode, is not included in Windows by default, so users need to install it separately. This can be a complex process, especially for users who are not familiar with command-line interfaces or Unix-based software.
 Compatibility issues: Some of the advanced features of Org-mode, such as exporting …]]></summary>

Some times the characters are a few ones scattered on the screen, some times they align in a line, and you can't select and delete them. They only disappear when you close and reopen the buffer. I also didn't find there is an operation pattern that triggers this. Anyone knows why, and how to solve this problem? thank you very much.

 I read that splitting up Org files is not always a smart idea. I was thinking if I should put all them in one file and eventually create "custom agenda views" to separate the personal and work tasks in case things start to get crowded.

 I could live with a way that showed a preview of svg in emacs, but clicking on it would open it in a browser for editing, as long as the svg is locally stored.

 Emacs showing perspectives as tabs in the tab-bar
 Adding and removing perspectives using the 'x' and '+' buttons just works.
 It's not on any repo yet, as I'd like some feedback first ;)
 You can find it here: perspective-tabs

 Credit where credit is due: 
 When building this, I had a long hard look at Bufler by alphapapa, especially the implementation in bufler-workspace-tabs.el
 I'm only hacking, while sitting on the shoulders of giants. Thanks! \m/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current opinions (subject to change):
  
Most websites should mostly work without JS enabled. (In fact, they should mostly work even on text-only browsers.)
 Most "single page apps" (SPAs) could easily be ordinary websites that mostly work without JS enabled.
 Most SPAs therefore suck (because of the fact that they are SPAs to begin with).
 Calling Haskell functions it not possible from the standard JS/DOM on an ad-hoc basis, is it? (Only in this way is it possible to enrich a website that mostly works without JS enabled, with certain features in cases where JS is enabled.) Note: Rumors of one or two individuals doing it with some obscure trickery does not count. It should be supported by the ecosystem as a fully fledged feature.
 Therefore, you are confined to SPAs when using Haskell/JS.
 Therefore, Haskell is simply not a suitable language for web development in general and that's just the way it is. (Apps that are legitimately SPAs only are a rare minority and that's not what I'm talking about here.)
 This is precisely where PureScript shines.
  
Someone please debunk the above, because I really would love to be wrong so I could use Haskell for everything.

So, I am collecting individual use cases (or perhaps even: instances). Whenever I try something I document it and leave it there. Occasionally, I will write add hypothesis to it. I will add an example to show what I mean.
If my notes on this matter reach a level that is worth publishing I will bring everything together to a document that will be available as donationware.
If you have any case study, successful interaction or failure or thoughts in general, I'd be happy if you share it.
Live long and prosper

 Then months or years later, How could refile all the done tasks under heading of Plans to GetThingsDone heading in one single command? 
 Current solution is first to use occur to popup all the done tasks "C-u M-s .*DONE.*" in a narrow to subtree window, then copy them to heading of GetThingsDone; 
 Second to delete them under Plans heading with regex in the previous narrow window.

 I'm using Company with the company-tng-mode and I would like to trigger the completion on the selected item with <return> when the completion window is open.
 This is how I configured the package
 elisp (use-package company :bind (:map company-active-map ([down] . nil) ([up] . nil) ([return] . company-complete-selection)) :config (global-company-mode t) (delete 'company-dabbrev company-backends) :custom (company-minimum-prefix-length 2) :hook (after-init . company-tng-mode) :init (setq company-dabbrev-downcase 0 company-idle-delay 0)) 
 For some reason, when the completion menu is active, I select an item and I press <return> the editor creates a newline.
 Is there something I'm doing wrong? I tried different things but I'm totally lost

 I checked magit-status on a different repository, and everything works as it should - it showed unstaged changes just fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved Ctrl/Cmd to capslock about 15 years ago when I started to get pinky pain. But am just picking up Emacs now and committed to getting over the hump. Enjoying it so far. Except I'm picky about my modifier keys..
 I settled on a layout that I love:
 - Capslock as Ctrl
 - Enter (when held) as Meta.
 It's symmetrical, and feels identical whether using my macbook pro's keyboard or mechanical split keyboard with array of thumb keys which would otherwise be great modifiers. Enter still works as usual newline if you tap it.
 When navigating with something like C-f, I appreciate my left hand doesn't have to move to go from C-f to M-f.
 I use Karabiner to make this possible. 
 On macos
 .config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications 
 Create a json file 
 (omit "conditions" - I use this to only apply this modification for built-in macbook keyboard. My mechanical keyboard is programmable and has it's own configuration to achieve this function which is a little smarter but same effect)

Unfortunately, I'm a beginner with elisp, having spotty experience with CL only. How can I really get up to speed with elisp? What path of study would you suggest? What I've seen with elisp is that it's very close -- always seems to be getting closer -- to CL -- buuuut it has its own "best practices" realm, i.e., you can't just take your CL code and CL mentality verbatim into elisp. I've also heard that the traditional An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp hasn't really been updated to include the lexical scoping yet -- which is a game-changer that can't be avoided, i.e., you're learning/doing it wrong if you don't work with lexical scoping. Any ideas how to chart a course of study to become a competent elisper?

 I'm a product guy with non-prod-levels of previous coding experience (HTML/CSS, Python) and I'm learning Scala with the intent of making it the first language I'm proficient in to the degree that I can write software in it.
 Looking at the big picture - obviously Scala is multi-paradigm and sets me up for tackling a lot of different use cases by itself, but what language(s) do you consider to be the best ones for matching with Scala once I've mastered it?
 (I appreciate that the simplest answer to this is probably "Depends what you want to work on!" I'm still mulling my options in that sense, so getting a sense that 'Scala + x = Great prospects in y" would be incredibly helpful).
 Thanks!

  Friday 12 June 2022 8:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:47 ┄┄┄┄┄ ← now ─────────────────────────────────────────────── 12:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 16:00-20:00 Teaching 16:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 18:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 20:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 
 This can be rather confusing at a glance, as it might lead to think that I could arrange a meeting at 18:00. Moreover, it doesn't help visualizing easily how much time an activity (such as Teaching, in this case) demands. 
 How would I go from that (above) to this (below):
 Friday 12 June 2022 8:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:47 ┄┄┄┄┄ ← now ─────────────────────────────────────────────── 12:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 16:00 Teaching 18:00 Teaching 20:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 
 so I can see how much of my time is blocked by activities?
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nothing but anecdotal data, but when a newcomer is faced with a choice between Emacs or Vscode, they will very likely choose Vscode, one of the reasons being that Emacs has a rightful reputation of having a steep learning curve. The idea of having to install a dozen packages to get modern IDE-like features and write Elisp right away in order to customize them can be daunting and overwhelming. Personally, it took me a couple of years before I even bothered to start learning Elisp to become a more advanced user.
 By providing a more streamlined and user-friendly way to customize Emacs, we can help make the platform more approachable and welcoming to new users.
 One approach could be to provide a series of customizable templates or configurations that new users could choose from when first setting up Emacs. These templates could be designed for different use cases (e.g., programming, writing, project management, etc.), and could include pre-installed packages, keybindings, and other customizations that are tailored to the user's needs. This would allow new users to get started with a powerful and customized Emacs setup without having to dive too deeply into the details of Elisp code.
 Another approach could be to provide a more user-friendly interface for customizing Emacs, such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or a set of interactive prompts that guide users through the customization process. This would make it easier for users to discover and experiment with different customization options, and would help them feel more confident and in control of their Emacs setup.
 I think we need to put some work and effort on this.

 However, one thing in corfu require more effort than company is how we can select candidate with corfu-index mode. 
 In company, to select 1st candidate, I can press Alt-1, 2nd candidate is Alt-2. But in corfu, we have to press Alt-1 RET to select 1st candidate, Alt-2 RET to select 2nd one...
 Is there anyway I can configure corfu to behave like company?

 First and foremost I am super new to emacs. Specifically I am using Doom Emacs and I just got a new system up and rolling and installed Doom Emacs. I have done this many times before and have never had a problem. After Emacs is installed I usually go into the init.el to add the languages that I will be using along with editing the config.el file to change the font as well as the theme of emacs. This time I am getting an error anytime I try to open a file https://imgur.com/a/1BTOvrh - I have never seen this and I can't seem to find anything via a google search. I am sure that I haven't given enough information so if that is the case let me know and I will share anything that is needed!
 Appreciate the help in advanced.

 I started a podcast focused on Emacs and plan to release one episode a week. I've never done anything like this before, so I'm sure there's a lot of room for improvement :-). I've made a Git repository that contains the show notes, for those who aren't interested in listening to the podcast or me.
 In the fist episode, I discuss how I make use of locate, to recursively find files based on the current projects scope. You can read the episodes show notes here. Let me know if you have any questions, thanks!

What I need is some what of specifying (probably in a directory e.g. with project.el) that the project `*.ts` files I'm working on are in fact deno files and need to initialize lsp-mode with the deno language server.
 Does anyone have guidance for configuring lsp-mode to work in this situation? I effectively want the default to be my current configuration, using typescript-language-server. When I'm in a deno project, I want to use the deno language server.
 Here you can see my web-mode configuration specified for `*.ts` files:

 Dear all,
 I just want to send you all a quick note to let you know that we have an opening for a student internship, on-site at NASA Ames Research Center, this summer:
 https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000000y6o5EAA/onsite-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime
 The student, if selected, will be working on extending our capabilities to test cFS/ROS/FPrime applications, especially those using Ogma and/or Copilot for monitoring. Both Ogma and Copilot are open-source software written in Haskell.
 Applicants for this internship must be U.S. Citizens and meet a minimum 3.0 GPA requirement. Prior experience is not required. Knowledge of the following will be considered a plus: Haskell or other functional languages, C/C++, Bash, git, Docker, Linux, NASA Core Flight System, Robot Operating System, FPrime. Please note that the academic level listed in the opening is merely indicative and students at other levels (e.g., PhD) will also be considered.
 For further details, or if you have any questions, see intern.nasa.gov and the specific listing at https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000000y6o5EAA/onsite-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime.

 Maybe I’m misunderstanding how it’s supposed to work but I like to develop functions in a module ( I start with a skeleton Lib.hs from a stack project and add new functions to this file and then load and test them in ghci repl in a terminal. I get warnings from hls that say the functions are not used . So what ? There are plenty of cases where you want to define a function but not use it , so I’m guessing I’m doing something else wrong .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a set of annotations and a case class as follows:
 import scala.annotation._ class GreaterThan(level: Double) extends StaticAnnotation class SmallerThan(level: Double) extends StaticAnnotations case class Quantity(@GreaterThan(0) x: Double, u/SmallerThan(1) y: Double, n: String) 
 I would like to access each field of the case class, its type, its annotation(with value) in order to do something with this information.
 Like I would like to know that there is x in Quantity, that is Double, that is annotated with GreaterThan, where the value of the annotation is 0. 
 Is there a way to achieve that in Scala? I know reflect could achieve part of what I want, mainly the fields and the types. But the annotations .. Can't find a reference for that!
 Many thanks

I want to use emacs to write all of my php code using php-mode and all the utilities it brings but the indentation is not what I want. When I type ENTER after a function I want to write the left curly brace with the same indentation as the function definition. Something like this:
 https://preview.redd.it/fmcbgnisnjia1.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=124a72aa69244a781bf6f401b191522d6003b224
 But instead when I hit enter after defining the function the brackets are like this:

 I guess php-mode is doing this but I'd like to change it. I've tried overriding the c-set-style to "linux" and many other styles but it doesn't work. Does anyone know how to do this without rejecting php-mode and use web-mode instead? I really like php-mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a newb programming question, and unfortunately Googling has failed me. I see this kind of code all the time in minad's packages where an anonymous function is put inside a named function:  (defun tempel--completion-table (templates) "Return a completion table for a list of TEMPLATES. The completion table specifies the category `tempel'." (lambda (str pred action) (if (eq action 'metadata) '(metadata (category . tempel)) (complete-with-action action templates str pred))))  What would be the purpose of doing that? My guess is that the named function is later going to by applyed or apply-partiallyed, and the other function that will do the applying wants to influence the result in some variable way with an argument to the named function, and the lambda inside the named function only accepts a fixed number of arguments (because that’s how the underlying lisp code that is being hacked was written), and so there needs to be this middleman named function. 
 Am I close, or hopelessly far off? Are there any other reasons one might put a lambda inside a named function?

 I cannot mix emphasis properly ie.*T*his *should* be *bold* should bold "T", "should", and "bold" but instead bolds "This should"

Prolog is unique in that it's like a database where you enter "facts" into a running REPL, then do queries on those facts in the running REPL. This means a Babel, in order to be useful, must be able in one code block to add new facts to the REPL, then give answers to a code block acting as a query. Just the normal prolog-mode will only allow you to write out a database of facts in a buffer, then pose the queries in the the running REPL -- not both together. (This is not dissimilar to any other interpreted language with code and REPL separated.) Again, Babel should offer both in the same buffer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use emacs for email, but it polls my emails every 5 minutes. This works great in general, but I would like to use it with Delta Chat as well (something as grand as Telega is not expected), which would mean having an IM-level of responsiveness for wherever I have my chat set up. DeltaChat is FSF, too, so I have hopes; but nothing seems evident at https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryChatClient . Does anyone know of a good solution so that I can keep DeltaChat similar to how I keep my Telega in emacs?

 from time to time my (spac)emacs is slow, which I try to resolve using the internal problem. However, it seldomly points me a in a useful direction. Most recently, one of the lags occurred when I tried opening an org-roam node using helm. Typing characters in helm was slow, so I profiled it
 ​
 CPU profling
 ​
 Memory profiling
 It points (unsuprisingly) to Helm and org-roam, whereas I was hoping that there is a third component involved (like a minor-mode) that's making problems.
 ​
 My question is essentially: How would you go from here to identify (and mitigate) potential underlying issues?
 Best,

 When I'm typing a method name, i.e. `this.myMethod`, when the company auto-complete kicks in, it seems that lsp-mode or flycheck decides that's a great time to check my code and point out problems, when I know full well I'm in the middle of typing a line of code.
  
Is this lsp-mode or company mode doing this?
 Can I tell it to wait a bit? Maybe until I'm done typing the symbol? Or even done typing the line?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because I've been concerned that emacs packages could contain exploits I've been manually auditing them all before manually installing them... This takes a long, long time to do for the hundreds of package I have installed, so I rarely update them all.
 I'd like to speed this up and ease my pain by using a package manager, but need to find one that will let me audit package before installing them. In particular, I'd like to go through diffs of package updates in ediff, and have the option of accepting our rejecting each update instead of just blindly installing it.
 Related to this, I'd also like to have the package manager store checksums (modern ones like sha256, not just git's sha1) for every version of a package I install, so that if I need to reinstall I can be assured I don't have to re-audit the code because it's exactly the same that I audited and approved earlier.
 Are there any package managers that would fit my needs?

 I'm trying to figure out how to specify, for a particular document, how to get latexmk to build using xelatex instead of pdflatex, particularly for org-beamer.
 Right now I've got:  %%% Local Variables: %%% coding: utf-8 %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-engine: xetex %%% TeX-command-extra-options: "-xetex" %%% End: 
 But this doesn't seem to do anything, looking at the org-beamer output, it's still saying ``Run number 1 of rule 'pdflatex'. 
 From what I can see, the +latexmk option imports the auctex-latexmk package, which adds latexmk to tex-commands-list and sets it as the default. So what I'm trying to figure out is how to get the -xelatex option to latexmk from emacs.
 I've tried futzing about with .latexmkrc but it seems to ignore it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted a while back about a new project I was working on called The Haskell Guide. I've continued working on it, and want to share a "version 1.0".
 The goal of this project is to make it as easy as possible for someone with a light coding background (e.g. some experience with Python) to pick up the core ideas of Haskell quickly, without them giving up because of the unfamiliar syntax, complex types, seemingly restrictive purity, ill-documented ecosystem, and the many choices of set up. 
 In this respect, The Haskell Guide is not a tutorial, project-based guide or textbook, which aims to give a more complete walk through the language, in a linear fashion, but more like a reference guide that is carefully designed to be accessible and clear. In that respect, it's like a beginner level ver…]]></summary>

Ive familiarised myself with the default Emacs bindings and found myself missing the speed of editing text Ive had in Nvim. I do realise that theres a getting used to phase, but I can foresee that even after getting used to emacs key-binds I wont match up to what Ive had in Nvim. I have currently installed avy, highligh-region packages and they have helped, but I wonder what is it that I am missing. Is there something builtin to Emacs that Im not utilising, is my overall mental approach wrong. Please share your ways, packages, philosophies of editing and navigating text in Emacs

I found it hard to use at first so I decided to try something else and I found website and as of now I have some experience with vim. I use .org for taking notes. After some months I decided, I'll once again try emacs and then I found 'evil keybindings'.
 Right now I have few questions..
  
Which keybindings should I use?
 Will I need to use default emacs keybindings even if I use evil?
 Will I need to remap a lot of keys when using default emacs keybindings?
 Is one efficient over the another or is it just personal preference?
  
Hope I made my question understandable
 Thanks in advance

 Emacs is not installed by default on these images, but can be apt-gotten. However, default image size pushes the limits of the local storage. 
 I could install jed or jove or mg, but those are great VI replacements, not lightweight emacsen. These are all that google finds for me, given a range of search terms about lightweight emacs.
  
Q: Does there exist a true emacs (not work-alike) distribution that is made lighter through the separation of formerly default package into add-on libraries? For example, for my usecase, terminal-only core with python and comint and shell modes would be all I need, so I'd like to apt-get install emacs-core emacs-shell emacs-python and avoid all org-mode, mail, gnus, ... and also the graphical UI code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to upgrade the stack lts on one of my project (from lts-10.9 to lts-20.11).
 The project uses Persistent and Servant and I encounter the following issue.
 The following code
 ``haskell -- |Appis the monad stack used in the Servant Handlers. It wraps -- Servant'sHandlermonad in aReaderTmonad that holds the server's --Config` data. type App = ReaderT Config Handler
 type AppSQL = SqlPersistT App
 -- | Run & return a database query. runDB :: AppSQL a -> App a runDB query = asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query ``` doesn't compile anymore (with the following error message)
 ``` /home/max/devel/mae-website/server/src/Server.hs:49:22: error: • No instance for (unliftio-core-0.2.1.0:Control.Monad.IO.Unlift.MonadUnliftIO Handler) arising from a use of ‘runSqlPool’ • In the second argument of ‘(>>=)’, namely ‘runSqlPool query’ In the expression: asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query In an equation for ‘runDB’: runDB query = asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query | 49 | asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query |
 ^
 ```
 I understand that the "new" version of Persistent requires Servant Handler to be MonadUnliftIO which is not the case. I also understand that I am suppose to use acquireSqlConn somehowe (following this this), but I can't figure it out. Any ideas ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 So one year ago I started learning Scala. Because it's a challenge and also because I want to get to know functional programming without hopping immediately into something like Haskell. Keep in mind that my current job and all my skills are within full-stack typescript development. So Scala is definitely something else and that's also why I am so intrigued by the language. 
 But now my question is, I kinda want to move away from typescript and go the Scala way. Because I think Scala has much bigger problems to solve and the language is more mature (also because of pay).
 I am hoping to do this one year from now. I am currently learning Cats and have been reading a lot after my working hours. I recently purchased "The definitive guide" for Spark, in order to maybe spark an interest in data engineering (see what I did there).
 A lot of co-workers look weird at me when I say I have been learning scala. And they ask me why. And they think it's a waste of time (because "java is bad")
 I have been looking at jobs, and I don't see a lot of remote junior scala positions (I will be working from Belgium). As I don't have any JVM experience, I do have a passion for learning. Does this seem possible to all of you or is this a stupid idea? 
 Nevertheless, learning this language has never been a stupid idea since it has taught me so much.
 But just wanna get an opinion from some of the pros.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I enjoy solving simple coding puzzles in Haskell, but I am still mostly a beginning Haskell programmer. On LeetCode, there is a problem called "First Missing Positive". The problem states
  
"Given an unsorted integer array nums return the smallest missing positive integer. You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space."
  
Is it possible to create an O(n) run time algorithm in Haskell for this problem? 
 I can create an algorithm in C to solve this problem, but the only algorithm that I came up with modifies the input array which is something that I don't think I would do if I was programming for someone else.

 Should I stick withe GHC 8.10 (and use lts-18.28) or should I upgrade to GHC 9.*.
 My problem with GHC 9 is that ,GHC 9.0 might have some bugs in it, but the going to GHC 9.4 might means less library are available to stackage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am more and more in situation when I have to use compact and laptop keyboards witch chiclet keys. I have no issue with flat chiclet keyboards, except of the typical layout of the last row. 
 Two examples, the upper one is a laptop keyboard, the bottom one is a compact desktop keyboard.
 https://preview.redd.it/hgsa2xfz0yha1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=824cc12df8fc5dce11ffeac1d4239f160d101eec
 Other features, common in Europe, are a short <shift> on the left side and a narrow two row <enter>.
 I need to figure out how to use them with emacs efficiently and possibly ergonomically. I am used to use a standard keyboard and my palm to press <Ctrl> but this clearly doesn't work here. 
 How do you type on keyboards like this? Did you change your typing habits? How do you use <Ctrl> and <Alt> on the right side next to the arrow block? What fingers do you use to press them? Do you change the keyboard or command map?
 Any hint and experience is welcomed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 A couple of weeks ago I posted about how I think that Erlang/OTP's behaviours are more fundamental than lightweight processes and message passing when it comes to building reliable distributed systems.
 The post got a couple of comments, including one from Robert Virding (one of the Erlang creators), basically saying that one needs lightweight processes and message passing to in order to implement behaviours, even though I sketched an implementation that doesn't use lightweight processes at the end of the post.
 Anyway, this inspired me to start working on a follow up post where I flesh things out in more detail. This post quite isn't ready yet, but I've finished a first Haskell prototype implementation which I'd like to share:

 As usual I'd be curious to hear your thoughts!

 I need to submit a summary of a series of events to a lawyer, and I wrote it up in an eleven page org document as it was most natural. Now I am trying to export it into a PDF file, because he is not going to know what to do with an org file or even a text file for that matter. The problem is, I need it to remain a nested outline, and not have nodes converted to headings. 
 It seems that a good approach is to export it to an HTML file first, and then convert the HTML file to PDF later. To do this, I thought about using AWK, but it would take too long to learn and perform. I was also looking at using some python with beautiful soup, which might work, although uncertain. Then, there is always the masochistic approach of editing the file by hand. I know sed might do the trick, but my sed pants are not big enough to tackle that one. 
 Help me, please...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[# This is a cross-post from Haskell Discourse; sorry for duplication.
 It is our great pleasure to announce the first OSS release of guardian, a dependency boundary constraint checker for Haskell monorepo!
 https://github.com/deepflowinc/guardian
 If you have a trouble with Haskell monorepo with increasing complexity of the package dependencies, then guardian could help the situation! It is developed at DeepFlow, Inc. and has been used almost for two years.
 With guardian, you can divide the packages into several "domains", and define the allowed dependency between those domains. Guadian will make sure that the only predefined dependencies between domains are introduced by package dependencies and report the result.
 For more details and motivation, please refer to README.
 Thanks!

 to my extra-deps in stack.yaml. Used stack --resolver lts-18.28 build to build the project. I'm getting the following error with clang.

 So far I have used the lts-20 as resolver for my project and it worked fine. Since amaonka supports only ghc 8.10.7 I used lts-18.28 as resolver. 
 I'm using Mac m1 Monterey (12.6.2). I installed llvm@12 via brew and when I type clang --version I get the following output. 
 Homebrew clang version 12.0.1 Target: arm64-apple-darwin21.6.0 Thread model: posix InstalledDir: /opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@12/bin 
 Any suggestions on how to fix this issue?

 This isn't a question related only to Haskell, but I'm more interested to hear what you guys have to say about that and which approach is best to follow and whether you could recommend some resources for me to read and go through, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a problem with my org-habit consistency graph. Mainly, I do not understand how it works.
 I have a habit which repeats every day and I mark it "DONE" on that day if I have compeleted it. If I do not, I don't change it's state.
 I have done it for 6 times during the past 2 weeks and this is my agenda org file contents for that habit:
 * TODO EXAMPLE SCHEDULED: <2023-02-12 Sun +1d> :PROPERTIES: :CATEGORY: EXAMPLE :STYLE: habit :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-02-12 Sun 20:17] :END: - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-12 Sun 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-11 Sat 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-10 Fri 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-05 Sun 20:15] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-04 Sat 20:15] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-03 Fri 20:15] 
 But when I open my org-agenda weekly view I see this:
 Here for example, all the days that were "DONE" are marked as "DONE" but they have different colors. I would like to see blue bar on the days that it was done and red bar for the days it was not.
 Also, could I assign different colors for different keywords?
 I would like "DONE" to be blue, "NOT DONE" to be red, "DELAYED" to be yellow and such.
 Right now, every keyword that is logged is marked as "DONE" in the consistency graph here and has different coloring even though all the states are "DONE".
 I am using Doom Emacs and org-super-agenda
 Thanks!

 * TODO EXAMPLE SCHEDULED: <2023-02-12 Sun +1d> :PROPERTIES: :CATEGORY: EXAMPLE :STYLE: habit :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-02-12 Sun 20:17] :END: - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-12 Sun 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-11 Sat 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-10 Fri 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-05 Sun 20:15] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-04 Sat 20:15] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-03 Fri 20:15] 
 But when I open my org-agenda weekly view I see this:
 org-agenda consistency graph
 Here for example, all the days that were "DONE" are marked as "DONE" but they have different colors. I would like to see blue bar on the days that it was done and red bar for the days it was not.
 Also, could I assign different colors for different keywords?
 I would like "DONE" to be blue, "NOT DONE" to be red, "DELAYED" to be yellow and such.
 Right now, every keyword that is logged is marked as "DONE" in the consistency graph here and has different coloring even though all the states are "DONE".
 I am using Doom Emacs and org-super-agenda
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read NixOS documentation and Nix package manager specific docs about the way to configure packages (specifically Emacs since there are sections reserved for it) and everywhere it assumes we are using a global configuration .nix file or home-manager which I'm not using since I'm on openSUSE.
 My configuration goes in ~/.emacs.d and it only picks up my early-init.el (it wasn't being picked up in ~/.config/emacs for some reason) and nothing from my init.el which includes downloading packages through package.el and I'm sensing Nix wants to manag them.
 So I'm wondering how should I configure Emacs or if Nix expects a config .nix file (and where) or if it's a bit of both ways? How do you configure Emacs if you are not in NixOS and you installed it via Nix?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to all!
 I don't know about you, but sometimes with embark I need to insert something into the minibuffer, not the main buffer. That is, I do for example M-x cp/consult-ripgrep-with-directory (personal command that calls consult-ripgrep but asks where to search before with a folder path), and there I need a directory. So I do M-x in the minibuffer (see enable-recursive-minibuffers) and type consult-recent-file, remove the filename to get the folder name... and then I want to insert what I have in the previous minibuffer. My problem is that embark-insert only allows inserting into the main current buffer... 
 Same problem when I know that I need the path of a bookmark.
 How do you do this guys ? Have you an idea to resolve this issue ?

 It brings to mind Emacs ludicruous speed which is another way of prepping emacs configurations for fast startup.
 Would the combination of native compilation, emacs ludicruous speed and some of the features of Emacs 29 make an Emacs version of Babashka a practical thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I want to give emacs another shot. Last time I tried it, I attempted to make my own config, and I installed some packages and whatnot, along with evil mode.
 It felt really sluggish and slow, it even paused while I typed due to the LSP plugin. I didn't really like it. Plus, evil mode made the entire experience very inconsistent. I love vim keybindings, but emacs is not just a text editor, and that's kind of the appeal of it, and emacs is built around its own keybindings, so trying to force vim ones on it just makes a mess really...
 So how usable is emacs as a text editor with the default ones? Having to reach for control all the time sounds annoying, although I guess I could replace caps lock for control, since that's far more reachable. How fast are you editing text with it? Do you prefer it over vim keybinds?
 People like the guy in the "tsoding" channel use emacs without evil mode, and he can type quite fast. Any tips about this?

 This seems get calling M-x evil-close-fold, M-x evil-open-fold, and M-x evil-toggle-fold to work, but none of them work when I use zc, zo, or za. I have no ideas why one way of calling those functions would work and the other wouldn't. Any help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! 
 I'm trying to start a scala project. I tried to setup a basic environment project: I've installed metals as a vscode extensions, and I've installed scala and sbt from coursier like official scala docs. 
 Metals create lot of directories which I don't know what the are used for. Sbt also do that when creating a project with it. It was a bit overwhelming, so I just flush those and tried to start with the simplest dev environment I could get. 
 Well, I couldn't resolve a single custom package, so I just reset the regular way metals and sbt wanted it to be. Still can't resolve custom packages, unless the file is at the project root. 
 Is it "normal" to feel lost with the dev environment, or am I missing some point ? Is there some exhaustive-ish resources you would recommand to get started with scala ?

 By quoting a region, I do not mean to simply adding a quote around the region, but also do necessary changes, e.g.:
  
abc -> "abc"
 a"bc" -> "a\"bc\""
 abc\n -> "abc\\n"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally posted to the emacs stack exchange here, but figured id ask here as well!
 When I narrow to a subheading in emacs, I would love for it to be displayed as if it was the top level as opposed to it staying the level it actually is.
 For example consider this tree
 * Heading 1
 ** Heading 2
 *** Heading 3
 **** Heading 4
 ***** Heading 5
 foobar...
 In my emacs displays it more like this:
 * Heading 1
 _* Heading 2
 __* Heading 3
 ___* Heading 4
 ___* Heading 5 foobar...
 And if I narrow to heading 4 it displays like this:
 ___* Heading 4
 ____* Heading 5 foobar...
 However I would like it to display like as a 'top level' header like this:
 * Heading 4
 _* Heading 5 foobar...
 And when I wide, for it to display normally again.
 I'm very new to emacs, but I haven't found anyone else with this issue when searching, which suggests that either I'm doing something wrong or everyone is fine with it as is!
 If the latter is the case, I know overlays could potentially provide an solution but I'm very new to lisp (and especially elisp) so I have no idea whether it's even possible or not.
 I'm using the following version(s) of emacs on windows. I can attach my configs if needed!
 GNU Emacs v28.2 nil
 Doom core v3.0.0-pre HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD e96624926 2023-01-01 21:55:13 -0500

A command line version is essential for updating some packages, etc. The custom config for doom emacs is also essential to me.
 I installed Emacs using rpm-ostree and the command line version runs fine, loading the doom configuration as it should from .config/emacs and .config/doom. But the gui version does not run well with the doom configs - the window is initially black, and it only intermittently accepts keystrokes. If I disable my configs by running emacs -Q, the window opens and responds fine, there's just no doom goodness.
 I would appreciate any suggestions!

 I looked through the code of both erc-desktop-notifications.el and erc-notify.el and neither of these packages support this feature.
 It seems that I could potentially edit the erc-notifications-PRIVMSG function from erc-desktop-notifications.el to add the desired feature, however I am not able to figure out how to detect the current channel name from this function.
 I was wondering if anybody knows of a way that this can be done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a begginer at Haskell, but lately at work I have to read and modify lots of haskell codes. The general context is you have lots of data (just imagine excel table), and the codes usually try to compute something from these data, but when data contains error, we want these computation to revert to a simpler form,
 Example: you have function that multiply a column A by 2 and put the result in a new column B, but when data contains error, I want this function to just put 0 in new column B. 
 What would be a good global strategy to modify the codes? , since there are tons of these functions, I don't want to modify them individually. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FYI. It looks like ruff (a pretty fast python linter) just work with flymake out of the box.
  (add-hook 'python-base-mode-hook 'flymake-mode) (setq python-flymake-command '("ruff" "--quiet" "--stdin-filename=stdin" "-") 
 If you are using Eglot, you have to add it to the diagnostic functions:
  (add-hook 'eglot-managed-mode-hook (lambda () (cond ((derived-mode-p 'python-base-mode) (add-hook 'flymake-diagnostic-functions 'python-flymake nil t)) ;; if not adding diagnostic functions to other modes just use an if ;; ... (t nil)))) 
 Also if you are in Emacs 29 shellchek just works on bash scripts. All that is needed is to enable it:
  (setq-default sh-shellcheck-arguments "-x") ; follow sourced libraries (add-hook 'sh-base-mode-hook 'flymake-mode) ; requires shellcheck 
 Hope this helps someone.

So what is the best practice for elisp? For example I see setq, which seems generic, i.e., you can define a new symbol or update an existing one with setq (e.g., change a nil to t). So, e.g., how would I attach a name to a lambda anonymous function in elisp? Again, with Scheme it's simply put define in front of it. Once again, how much of CL do we, can we bring over to elisp?

 So I want to be able to somehow switch the 'git' user on the fly to switch between the 'git' user to push stuff to my personal GitHub repos vs my GitHub user for my work stuff.
 I have two separate GitHub accounts (one for work and one for personal stuff).
 How can I easily configure this in Emacs?
 Is this more of an Emacs config thing, or can I swap them out on the fly with the use of an interactive Hydra or something?
 Please link to any related guide if you can, since I can't seem to figure this out. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have a really well working lsp configuration for Scala? When I say well working I mean in contrast to mine that isn't that bad but has some problems:
 - Jump to definition works 95% of the times
 - Search symbol in workspace works 70% of the times and sometimes throws an overflow (?) error
 - I do not have the fancy intellij functions that find all subtypes for example or generally play with the type hierarchy
 - Many commands just fail saying that metals is not supporting the executeCommand command and I should check the capabilities of the session in which there actually is an executeCommandProvider with many commands reported available which do not work in reality
 ​
 Is metals just bad or have I possibly missconfigured it?

I had a DropBox fiasco this week. For some reason, all my zettelkaten files, on my office mac suddenly have a 3 Feb 2023 timestamp, both the modified and the created. The files on my shop laptop remain unchanged. But I'm worried and have temporarily turned off DropBox syncing. I've started a super-top-secret coding project that uses these file parameters and am worried my file's timestamps will get mucked with.
Oh well.
I spent a ton of time this week learning about manipulating python dictionaries. In the coming week, I'll be looking at html and css tools.
I'm really happy that my zettels are non-zettelkasting and life-focused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm considering which database library to use for a production system. For now I wanted to use persistent, however stumbled upon beam and it looks nicer to me. I've seen this post, however most of it is about persistent, and I didn't find how they differ in real production life. What I'm interested in is how do they compare in terms of 
  
features
 type safety
 scaling
 performance
 migrations
 productivity
 overall production readiness / adoption
  
I'm not afraid of a bit complexity, but I definitely hate TH / generated code. I'm keen on trying beam, but I'm just not sure if it's a right choice for a production system. Can someone more experienced with both libraries give their thoughts / opinions?

        <updated>2023-02-09T22:00:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last couple weeks while putting the treesit-auto package together it gained adoption much faster than I had expected. While I'm incredibly happy others found it useful, that also means that many assumptions in my hacky code were quickly blown apart. Also, in no small part due to my poor documentation, it was confusing to figure out exactly how/what would be supported when trying to add a new language.
 The key learning since I first tried to launch this package is that there's no reason for the grammar name in grammar.js to match the Emacs major mode, and there's a possibility that there are many "fallback" modes that should upgrade to the tree-sitter version, rather than just one. For these reasons and more, I needed to adjust the structure of how these modes are described internally alongside their grammars. As a consequence to that, some of the public functions/variables have been changed or removed. 
 I am sorry to anyone who has already picked up the package and started tweaking it. However, I think the changes will make the package more maintainable down the line, and it’s better to do this sooner rather than later. Most folks will probably not notice a difference if all you have set is treesit-auto-install and global-treesit-auto-mode. 
 Hopefully this is the last post I will need/want to to make about the package!
 TL;DR
 treesit-auto-fallback-alist no longer has any affect. If you want another language to be supported by treesit-auto, there is now a guide for contributing recipes

 and
 #+begin_src nix :noweb-ref A :noweb-ref B google-chrome-dev #+end_src

 #+begin_src nix :noweb-ref A google-chrome-dev #+end_src #+begin_src nix :noweb-ref B google-chrome-dev #+end_src 
 but this isn't very DRY and I'm fixating on this atm.
 Did a few websearches and even prompted GPT-3 but no dice. I think I need a human expert. 🙊
 # TL;DR
 For my home-manager Nix config, I am tangling a package name `google-chrome-dev` into the package listing `home.packages` (location A) and also to the `nixpkgs.config.allowUnfreePredicate` function body (location B) which just maintains a manifest of non-FLOSS packages that I want to clear for installation.

 I am using the following syntax for tramp: /ssh:user@server: (same issue when using sshx). I am using the version of Emacs provided at https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ which I didn't have any problems with when using Windows 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 For many years, my Org workflow has depended on the Agenda's ability to display entries that have active timestamps in the :PROPERTIES: drawer. As of version 9.5.5 this is working fine for me, as it always has. 
 However, I remember a discussion on the Org developer list some months back that the developers planned to remove this feature at some point in the future. I cannot, however, locate the thread where I read that. A search of this Reddit forum does not mention this matter either. 
 So, I thought I'd ask specifically: Is it true that the Agenda is going to lose its ability to act upon active timestamps in the :PROPERTIES: drawer?
 If true, that would be very unfortunate for me. But I want to be prepared if it happens. I see nothing about this matter in the Release Notes for Org 9.6, so I surmise it's safe for me to upgrade -- for now. 
 Many thanks for reading, and to all the Org developers for Org mode, which is a work of genius.

 I started with the coursera class, however a team member told me that this class was going way too deep and that I wont be using anything learnt with it (the code is "easy" scala, without expert concepts). However, I have also been told that a team member was coding poorly because he kept coding like we would do with imperative programming (using loops and coding in a way where several lines could be simplified with one or two by programming the way scala is supposed to be used). 
 So I'm kind of stuck because I'm being told that the coursera class is going too deeply, but I still have to find a tutorial so that I dont end programming in scala like I would do with an imperative langage. What can I do ? What do you suggest ?

 This is not the same as simply adding a timestamp, something much easier (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/32150/how-to-add-a-timestamp-to-each-entry-in-emacs-messages-buffer).
 Today I am getting the following error and I have no idea where it's coming from, and it's frustrating.
 Error processing message (file-missing "Cannot open load file" "No such file or directory" "company"). [2 times] 
 That's just one of a ton of different sorts of errors over the years that were unhelpful due to lack of indication where the fault is. I've learned to write all my error messages with more background info, but we can't expect every package author to do this.
 Any ideas on the necessary architecture? I guess the C source needs a patch, but can we do it in such a way that we don't need to update the calling convention i.e. so we don't need package authors to update every message sexp in their codebases?
