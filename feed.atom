        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I have
 ```
 +name: foo-overall
 +begin_src haskell :tangle foo.hs
 <<foo-a>> <<foo-b>>
 +end_src
 ```
 somewhere in my Org file and I have the definitions of these <<...>> noweb style references like this:
 ```
 +name: foo-a
 +begin_src haskell
 hello
 +end_src
 +name: foo-b
 +begin_src haskell
 world
 +end_src
 ```
 I would like to run org-html-export-to-html but make it so that:
  
each of the exported code blocks foo-a and foo-b link back to their location in foo-overall and
 foo-overall automatically links each of its <<foo-a>> and <<foo-b>> lines inside its code block to their respective definitions.
  
In other words, I would like these noweb style references to link to each other in both directions. This is so that after going to the definition of <<foo-a>> I want a link to click so that I can go back to the discussion for foo-overall and vice versa.
 AFAIK, #1 can be achieved by manually inserting Org refs (e.g. (ref:...) in the src block for foo-overall) as per https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html and then manually inserting a caption for the src blocks of <<foo-a>> and <<foo-b>>. However this is extremely tedious and is basically a deal-breaker for me.
 I've searched around for a solution for #2 and the closest thing I found was this comment. The script there just collects a list of all src blocks and inserts this list as a "References ..." note to every src block, which is too verbose. I see that there's a Stackoverflow question but it has gone unanswered.
 I can probably hack something together outside of elisp but was wondering if anyone had a similar desire to make noweb references automatically linked everywhere. Help?

Every day that I edit and save a file, create a backup for the file as it was before the edit.
 (I believe that is already how backup files work, correct?)
 Keep all the existent backup versions of the past 7 days.
 Keep one backup version per week of backup files older than 7 days.
 Keep one backup version per month of backup files older than 30 days.
 Keep one backup version per trimester of backup files older than 90 days.
  
Is there tool that does something similar? If not, what would be my first steps to try this? I didn't see anything in the Backup Files section of the manual that could help me with this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The default behaviour of org-store-link in an ordinary text file is to create a file: link with a search string, e.g. file:myfile.txt::Line 42. That doesn't suit me when creating links in certain cases so I added the following function to org-create-file-search-functions in order to instead get links like file:myfile.txt::42:
  (defun org-projectile-annotate-file-search-func () (when (and (projectile-project-p) (get-buffer-window "project-annotations.org")) (number-to-string (line-number-at-pos)))) 
 That works as expected, but then I read this bit in the documentation of org-create-file-search-functions
  
A function in this hook may also use setq to set the variable description to provide a suggestion for the descriptive text to be used for this link when it gets inserted into an Org buffer with org-insert-link.
  
I thought that might give me a way to make the description of the link a bit nicer (currently the description is the same as the link itself). However, I can't get it to work.
 I changed the function to
  (defun org-projectile-annotate-file-search-func () (when (and (projectile-project-p) (get-buffer-window "project-annotations.org")) (setq description "foobar") (number-to-string (line-number-at-pos)))) 
 but the link's description did not change. I then read the code for org-store-link and found no reference to description, but I did find desc so I did a setq on desc instead. Still no change to the link description.
 What is it I'm missing here? Or maybe the documentation is wrong?

 I’ve been working with Python for 3 years and I begun to explore the idea of learning a new language. I have done some projects at work using PySpark and I thought that going full blown Spark (i.e. learning Scala) would be a sensible option.
 However, I have no previous knowledge of Java and people also tend to be slightly negative about the idea of learning Scala for Spark since PySpark does a very similar thing… or so they say.
 My current job is a mixture of Python + databases… with a little bit of big data.
 What are you thoughts?
 Many thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello all.
 I've recently been using exwm and it's comfy, I like and dislike it's quirks.
 I have one question: is there any advantage on running exwm with a normal emacs client vs running emacs --daemon -f exwm-enable? I have sx configured that it launches dbus-run-session emacs and it works fine. but now I do this:
 s6-rc -l /tmp/${USER}/s6-rc -u change emacs-exwm
 while ! [ -e /run/user/1000/emacs/server ]
 do
 continue
 done
 exec dbus-launch /usr/bin/emacsclient -c
 where the first line it's just a supervised emacs --fg-daemon f exwm-enable.
 with this approach I can control emacs via kdeconnect (emacsclient --eval '(blabla)'), but is there any disadvantage?
 TL;DR when using exwm, is it better to use emacs with or without server-mode?

 I've configured emacs to use lsp-mode for several languages e.g. haskell when visiting a .hs file, python for a .py file. 
 These all work as expected according to my configuration.
 What happens often to me though is:
  
Open up such a file 
 lsp-mode fires up and connects (correctly) to the appropriate language server.
 
Edit other files of the same kind - all use the same languages server instance. Happy. 👍🏼
 
Kill the buffers using lsp-mode and connected to the languages server, one by one over time. 
 Close emacsclient (emacs server continues running as it should)
 
Language server is also still running despite having no more clients connected.
 
 Is it possible to have lsp-mode kill the language server automatically when there are no more clients?

 case class Box[A](a: A) def fun(string: Box[String]) = ??? val box: Box[Any] = ??? 
 find an elegant way to pass box to fun if it contains a String.
 in an ideal world we could have something like
 (boxes: Seq[Box[Any]])).collect { case box @ Box(_: String) => fun(box) } 
 but that won't work in reality
 (boxes: Seq[Box[Any]])).collect { case box @ Box(string: String) => fun(box.copy(a = string)) } 
 works, but it's a wart, and I think will result in an allocation
 (boxes: Seq[Box[Any]])).collect { case box @ Box(string: String) => fun(box.asInstanceOf[Box[String]) } 
 also works, but it's a wart and runs the risk that a future refactor gets the type in the cast different from the type in the pattern match

 I can see pros and cons for both but your experiences would be valuable

So, I've been writing linked notes for a few years now, and I've found some of the posts from this community to be particularly insightful, especially seeing behind-the-scenes of other people's processes. (I also adopted the idea of UIDs from this forum, which I use constantly).
While I've used my notes regularly for myself–during my work and for writing articles–I've never shared any of my notes directly. So, I recently decided to start posting some online straight from my editor – a place where I spend a decent part my day thinking and researching.
I always find it useful to see how other people record and connect their thinking, and I hope this might be interesting/helpful. I'll be adding to the collection on Twitter every couple of days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a function that exports all the tables in the subtree at point to a single CSV file. I tried to implement this by narrowing to the subtree at point and then applying org-table-map-tables:
 (defun sbr-org-export-subtree-tables () "Export the Org tables in subtree at point to TSV file." (interactive) (save-excursion (while (/= (org-current-level) 1) (org-up-heading-safe)) (let* ((table nil) (chapter (car (split-string (nth 4 (org-heading-components)) ":"))) (file (format "%s.csv" (replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" (downcase chapter))))) (org-narrow-to-subtree) (org-table-map-tables (lambda () (setq table (nconc table (cddr (org-table-to-lisp))))) t) (org-toggle-narrow-to-subtree) (with-temp-buffer (orgtbl-insert-elisp-table table) (beginning-of-buffer) (org-table-export file "orgtbl-to-tsv"))))) 
 I notice that this function is exporting all the tables in the buffer, not just the tables in the current subtree. It appears that org-table-map-tables is ignoring the narrowing of the buffer to the subtree. Is this a bug, or am I misunderstanding how org-table-map-tables is intended to be used?

 A monitoring program have been deployed in the ryu controller in order to capture the network traffic with two classes (normal and attack) .
 The monitored traffic has been saved in csv file and treated as a dataset in order to train a deep learning model for network traffic classification . 
 A One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) model has been developed using tensorflow and keras. The trained model was saved as h5 file . My question is how to deploy or integrate the h5 model and run it inside the ryu controller .. I have tried to do the tensorflow integration in different ways but unfortunately I failed as I faced many difficulties in installing tensorflow and its supporting libraries inside the ryu controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've been struggling with this for a bit but is there a way to see the evil keybindings for a particular mode? I know we have describe-key, describe-mode, and describe-keymap, but it seems as though those are the Emacs bound keys. This isn't too much of a concern as I can switch to Emacs control from evil, but I was wondering if there is a way to see the evil bindings easily so I wouldn't have to switch back and forth. 
 If someone can give me a clue or point me in the right direction that would be appreciated. My google-fu is failing me currently

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a bit of Python newbie wanting to get into Django and Wagtail and need configure Python in Doom.
 I uncommented Python and running doom doctor came up with some errors about some addons.
 > :lang python ! Couldn't find isort. Import sorting will not work. ! Couldn't find pipenv. pipenv support will not work. ! Couldn't find nosetests. Running tests through nose will not work. ! Couldn't find pytest. Running tests through pytest will not work. 
 I suspect running pip to install the necessary python and emacs packages will fix those.
 Until LSP and pyls are installed is Python support provided by flycheck or some package installed by default?
 A worry I have is to know if what Doom did used Python 2 or Python 3 as both are installed on my system. I also saw some pip messages and perhaps that also involves Python 2
 Is that something I need to worry about now, or can that be deferred till later?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in desperate need right now. I'm taking a class at uni as a senior that focuses on a few different languages that are not in the degree track as much. To be specific. Haskell, Python, and Java. Python and Java I have no problem with. But for some reason, I cannot wrap my head around Haskell. I have tried everything. This class is a requirement for my degree and only one person teaches it. I've done well in my other classes and am familiar with a lot of other languages and I feel like I am about to throw tens of thousands of dollars away on a degree because I am struggling with one niche language that I never want to use again. I passed all the hard classes in my degree and my entire education hangs on this. No offense to people who love Haskell. I understand it can be a great language in certain uses. Anyone who was like a lost puppy when they started learning Haskell, what resources did you use? My degree, financial well-being, and mental health depend on it. Haskell is worth about 25% of the overall course grade and I already bombed the first assignment. Unfortunately, her questions are very hard and the homework is very strict on using resources and other people.
 She low key expects us to be fluent in haskell in just five weeks.
 I hope this post is okay here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that I have tamed end of line comments to line up with proportional fonts (using the display attribute :halign-to, which lets you make text display at a particular physical column), I'm wondering if I might be able to do the same for c++ lines which are indented because of being continuations of a statement for a previous line.
 This isn't such a big deal as the comment thing was, as it only affects continued lines, and looks OK anyway the way it is. But it would be nice - normally emacs will line things like an argument on a continuation line with the enclosing parenthesis from the function call, but with a proportional font it only ends up approximating that.
 ​
 It seems like what I would have to do, is in the code that calculates what character from the line above to line this line up with, calculate the physical position of that character and add the spaces, but also visually indent the next line using :halign-to.

 I saw that the clangd integration was available, so I turned it on, and I opened one of my normal project files.
 Why is clangd integration in VSCode so much faster and less painless? It came up with completions right away. I didn't have huge stalls while I waited for things to happen?
 I can only guess that something is weird with my setup, so I have to get rid of everything and start over, I think. I'll start with basically nothing except keybindings and eglot and p4.el and see if it's any better, because right now this is insupportable. The clangd integration in VSCode is faster than any code completion in Visual Studio or Jetbrains Rider, even with indexing turned on. I'd thought my stalls were because of clangd itself, and the absurd number of files it had indexed, but it's really not. I don't get symbol lookout timeouts in VS Code. There's something else afoot.

 I can't even find the lucid-emacs source code if such a thing exists. The github mirror for emacs is here.
 The original GNU emacs repo is here.
 I have found this page for emacs-lucid here which I am not so sure.
 So to sum up:
  
Does emacs-lucid have its own repo?
 Is it possible to compile it for alpine?

 To make my use of Mu4e an even better experience, I would love to combine for autocompletion the mail-addresses of org-contacts with the automatically collected mail-adresses of the mu database. I am using helm and tried out John Kitchins solution from https://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/03/14/A-helm-mu4e-contact-selector/, but if I (require 'org-contacts), the variable mu4e~contacts-for-completion is void, and if I do not (require 'org-contacts), I get the error: Symbonl's function definition is void: org-contacts-db.
 Does anyone of you combine the two sources for e-mail-address completion in mu4e, and how have you solved it?
 I was setting hopes in mu4e-contacts (https://gitlab.com/voidyourwarranty/mu4e-contacts). Regrettably, when I add the package and restart emacs, I get (error Recursive ‘require’ for feature ‘mu4e’).
 Thank you for any help and insights!
 I am using mu4e 1.8.9 and the newest version of org-contacts (that is on melpa again, yeah!).

 I've got an application that appears to get slower over time. I currently have no idea why. Ram usage seems constant, CPU usage seems low. But after a while, requests to the API take longer and longer.
 The problem is that I have no idea how to start working out where the performance issues are. It can take days before the problem sets in.
 Are there any good ways of getting to the bottom of this? Any tricks to facilitate debugging? I know that the RTS can spit out all sorts of logs, but I have no idea about interpreting them, or even if it's a good idea to log for days before stopping.
 So is there any good guides/tools for tackling this kind of problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellows,
 I am a recent denote convert and love it. It is an enriching expierience to have the ability to link notes to another (I have not used org-roam or exhausted hyperbole's capabilities). In my current workflow, I have bound org-store-link within my denote straight-use-package declaration because that's where I define other denote-related key-bindings and org-store-link has a denote: interface.
 When using that within a note created by denote itself, it works like a charm: I can just use the denote: type of link, a minibuffer selection is opened that shows the contents of my denote-directory.
 I tried to do the same in my todos.org file: org-store-link, denote: to link to a specific note. That did not work. After choosing the denote: type, I would have to manually enter the denote id, without completion and without minibuffer selection.
 I have no clue why that happens. Do you have an idea or a solution to this?
 Thanks a bunch, have a good day :)

 There are two things:
  
#1 ssh into Head Node. The cluster has login node but then I have to queue up for a node to do a big run. Then, I have to ssh into the (non-login) head node once slurm runs that. So, can I do this 'double ssh' using emac's gdb?
  load modules. gdb is on the cluster but a module needs to be loaded.
  
Is all this possible? It seems non trivial to do

 the Thompson book makes heavy use of GHCi. I do all my studying on my galaxy tab s6 lite tablet, so I don't have to lug around a laptop to the library and coffeeshops.
 is it possible to install ghci (including writing module files and loading them) on my android tablet? a quick Google search on this subreddit and Google, of [ghci Android], makes me think that I can't?

 Library for incremental dataflows in emacs. This library let's you construct dataflow graphs called data frames, i.e., computations on collections that can be evaluated lazily (on demand) and whose results can be materialized. The materialized versions can then be incrementally maintained, i.e., you provide inserts and deletions for the data sources processed by a dataflow graph and idf will update the results of the dataflow based on the changes to the input data sources (what elements got inserted and deleted from the data sources).
 The rationale is that is you have some large sorted list or hashtable that is the result of a non-trivial computation, it is faster to incrementally maintain the datastructure using idf if there are only small changes to t…]]></summary>

Now, if you run nix-shell, you’ll be given a shell with Rust, Cargo, and Cargo Flamegraph available to you.
That’s pretty neat, but what if you want to take it a step further, and use Nix to package your Rust code?
There are many options available, with different trade offs, and it can be quite overwhelming to choose between them, although there is some information on the NixOS Wiki.
In this post we are going to try the different options on a simple but…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm currently writing a rewrite rule system for an eDSL. Here is a very simplified version:
 data Expre = A | B | X Expre Expre process :: Expre -> Expre process A = B process B = A process (X ex1 ex2) = X (process ex1) (process ex2) 
 Expre pretty much represents a tree with two leaf constructors.
 process has my rewrite rules for terms of type Expre. All it does is swap A and B around. I was wondering if there is a canonical, clean way to track each application of a rewrite rule? So, concretely tracking the changes of my expression: process $ X A (X B A) should spit out the following list of intermediate terms:
 1 X B (X B A) 2 X B (X A A) 1 X B (X A B) 
 The number in the front represents which rewrite rule was applied. This feels very much like a problem that has a generic solution using a typeclass/data structure/idea that I'm not aware of, so I was wondering if such a thing exists. 
 My handrolled solution looks like this, there has to be a neater way:
 process :: (Expre -> Expre) -> Expre -> Writer [(Int, Expre)] Expre process fn A = tell [(1, fn B)] >> return B process fn B = tell [(2, fn A)] >> return A process fn (X ex1 ex2) = do e1 <- process (\e -> fn $ X e ex2) ex1 e2 <- process (\e -> fn $ X e1 e) ex2 return $ X e1 e2 
 Called with runWriter $ process id $ X A (X B A) in GHC gives the desired result.
 Thank you!

I'm not here to ask for suggestion or any kind of comparison between the two, don't worry. What I'd like to know is whether org-mode could be useful for a specific use case, which could make me lean towards doom emacs rather than neovim.
 From time to time I have to write documentation for software packages at work. While doing so, we like to have both a pdf version (using latex) to hand to our customers and an html (or similar) version to be stored inside the git repository of the project. To avoid having to write two different docs, we initially used markdown and a custom pandoc filter (for headings, frontpages and whatnot). The problem is that this approach is very limiting when it comes to cross-referencing, captions, and tables with cells spanning multiple columns or rows. Hence we switched to RMarkdown, but having to write R code for the sole purpose of properly handling a few images and tables is very frustrating.
 Do you think that org-mode could be used to solve the problem once and for all? I know that tables in org-mode are pretty powerful, but I don't know to which extent. Nor if the same syntax would be correctly translated both in latex and html as it is with simpler tables.
 Also, if any of you uses org-mode to write scientific papers (hence using different latex templates from different journals) in the STEMs, I'd like to hear your impressions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm on Doom emacs and I'm using typescript language server with LSP for my RJSX development. It works fine for the most part but I need to change a few things in the initializationOptions. You can click on the link to see the documentation I am talking about. 
 VSCode (probably) sets some options automatically and I'm trying to get my development environment almost the same as the one I had with VSCode. I just cannot figure out how to pass these configs when the server starts.

 I'm a newb with emacs and org mode. I've been trying to get something into the agenda view with org-agenda-custom-commands and org-super-agenda-groups but been failing miserably :D
 What I want is pretty simple and I'm sure there's a solution this, but I wasn't able to find it.Basically, I want to list all TODO items under a certain heading. For instance:
 * Tasks ** TODO some stuff ** TODO some other stuff ** non todo stuff * Not tasks ** some non task stuff ** TODO Some todo, but not under Tasks heading 
 Now, what I would like to list in an agenda view is all TODO items under the "Tasks" heading, but not under the "Not tasks" heading. After running the custom command, it should be like this:
 ** TODO some stuff ** TODO some other stuff 
 I've been trying to get this to work with the search command, but could not get this to work. I'm a bit at a loss right now, so any help, would be really appreciated :)

 VSCode has LSP support using terraform-ls (the Hashicorp one), and it works decently, but I'm finding it hard to get used to VSCode's UX.
 My assumption with LSP is that all heavy lifting should be done by the language server. Why does Eglot + terraform-ls not work as well as VSCode's implementation? Not even some basic auto-completion. Anyone managed to get it working?

 ​
 I am working remotely on a supercomputing cluster, running Emacs on my machine, and using TRAMP to edit python files on the cluster.
 To my great surprise, this works quite well, and the REPL also works flawlessly, as apparently run-python (C-c C-p) detects this is a remote file, and use the corresponding interpreter on the remote.
 ​
 However, I realized the version of Python running on the cluster is not the correct one. Indeed, they use the module utility to provide multiple conflicting version of programs. This means that I have to run module load python3 before executing python3 to make sure I have the latest version.
 ​
 If I SSH into the cluster, this is not a problem, as I just added the module load line in my .bashrc. However here, I am not sure how to do it: this is not an interactive shell, so the usual dotfiles are not read (.bashrc, .profile and friends).
 ​
 Any idea ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm currently trying to build a small package org-inline-block that aims to provide a simple syntax for blocks (without begin/end) based on indentation (like plain lists). While it would be cleaner to properly extend org-element for the export part, I only plan to add a function to 'org-export-filter-body-functions.
 Here comes the function (simplified version that isolates the problem):
 (defun org-latex-inline-block (text backend info) "Manage inline block in LaTeX export, as part of body." (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex) (let ((case-fold-search nil)) (replace-regexp-in-string "\\([ \t]*\\)\\(\\(Question\\)\\( (\\([^()]*\\))\\)?\\.\\)\\(\\(.*$\\)\\([\n]\\(\\1[\t ]+.*\\)?\\)*\\)" (lambda (substr) (format "\\begin{question}%s\\end{question}" (org-inline-block-get-core substr))) text nil t)))) 
 with
 (defun org-inline-block-get-core (s) "Given >Question. abcde<, return >abcde<" (let ((case-fold-search nil)) (string-match "Question\\( ([^()]*)\\)?\\. " s) (if (> (match-end 0) 0) (substring s (match-end 0)) ""))) 
 Here comes the unexpected behavior: if I try to export "Question. Where is Brian?", it will be exported to "\begin{question} Where is Brian? \end{question} Where is Brian? ", and I can't guess where this duplicate comes from... Any idea ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Is it possible to perform an AST re-write that depends on global knowledge derived from the AST while simultaneously evaluating the AST -- all in a single pass?
 The "Real" Problem:
 I'm working on a Haskell -> Elm code generator. I'm parsing out an Elm type AST (see below). The problem is that multiple TyDecl varname nodes could exist after parsing. E.g: the following haskell type definition
 data Foo = Foo Int | Bar [Foo] 
 generates
 TyDecl "Foo" [] ( TyVariant ( ( "Foo" , [ TyInt ] ) :| [ ( "Bar" , [ TyApp "List" [ TyDecl "Foo" [] (!!! Recursive def of Foo here !!!) ( TyApp "Foo" [] )] ] ) ] ) ) ( TyApp "Foo" [] ) 
 To solve this problem I am folding twice over the parsed AST.
 The first pass replaces all but one TyDecl "Foo" node with its TyApp "Foo" [] node. This is done by using an algebra
 preventDuplicats :: (MonadState (Set VarName) m) => Base Ty (m a) -> m a 
 Following the example above this rewrites the above AST to be:
 TyDecl "Foo" [] ( TyVariant ( ( "Foo" , [ TyInt ] ) :| [ ( "Bar" , [ TyApp "List" [ TyApp "Foo" [] ] ] ) ] ) ) ( TyApp "Foo" [] ) 
 The second pass evaluates the AST to generate the Elm code (essentially):
 generateElm :: Base Ty String -> String 
 What I'd like to do is construct some mechanism that would let me perform this AST re-write (preventDuplicates) while evaluating with the main algebra (generateElm). Maybe something like?:
 evalAndPrevent :: (MonadState (Set VarName) m, Comonad w) => (Base Ty (w a) -> a) -> Base Ty (w (m a)) -> m a 
 Ty Definition
 data Ty = TyVar VarName | TyApp VarName [Ty] -- This models `let` expressions in type declarations -- data B a b c = <a> in <b> == TyDecl "B" ["a","b","c"] <a> <b> | TyDecl VarName [VarName] Ty Ty | ... deriving (Show, Generic) 
 Attempted solutions?
 I've looked into prepomorphisms. However, this doesn't seem to work because the re-write morphism Base t a -> Base t a by defintion is a "local" only re-write.

 I like how lightweight org-super-links feels and the fact that the links are just standard or links that work in orgzly. Honestly I can't figure out what org-roam adds to the picture. That said there seems to be a bunch of hype about org-roam and feel like I must be missing something. 
 Honest question: can someone explain the attraction of org-roam over org-super-links? Is there something special about the org-roam-capture stuff that's different enough from org-capture to fill some gaps?

 UPDATE: my problem was that all the timestamps are inactive timestamps, which don't show up in org agenda view; active timestamps do.

Many FOSS projects use Akka in some way (Play Framework, Apache Flink, ...) and are therefore forced to lock the Akka version to the last Apache Licence 2.0 release or replace Akka. The additional use grant in the BSL license for the Play Framework is very limited and is no solution to move forward. 
 It would be the best for these FOSS projects to have a reliable Akka fork (focused on bug fixing and long term stability).
 Are there already ongoing initiatives for an Akka fork?
 Who would be willing to contribute to an Akka fork (financial contribution, development or organisational aspects)?
 How do we make this happen?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, I made a post about Okapi. Okapi is a micro web framework for Haskell. The feedback I got was great and I've made a lot of changes to Okapi since then. The core idea of Okapi is still the same: use monadic parsing to implement web servers.
 The biggest addition to Okapi since I last posted is the addition of named routes. One of the comments on my previous post asked if Okapi had named routes. At the time it didn't, but I think I've found a way to implement type safe named routes in Okapi without relying on Template Haskell or type-level programming like other Haskell web frameworks do.
 I've written a series of essays on the topic of named routes, and how they work in Okapi.
  
Named Routes in Okapi: Part I
 Named Routes in Okapi: Part II
 Named Routes in Okapi: Part III
  
Okapi is still in the early stages of development, so I'm looking for feedback. Any kind of feedback is appreciated. Whether it's the design of the documentation, code conventions, the names of functions, concerns, etc. Please don't hesitate.
 I'm really interested to hear what non-Haskell users and beginner Haskellers have to say. The blog posts I listed above are probably more geared toward advanced-beginner/intermediate Haskellers, but feel free to check out the hopefully more beginner friendly documentation listed below.
  
Official documentation
 Hackage candidate documentation
  
Documentation is still largely incomplete at this point, but I'm working on it. I want to get feedback on everything so far before going further.
 I can't recommend Okapi for production projects yet, but I've successfully been using it for small, long-running web applications of only a few users without any problems so far.
 Thank you for reading :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have heard that thrown around so many times that it was one of those sentences that didn't mean much anymore. Before I started using emacs I thought wtf does that even mean? I don't care what else it can do. I have everything else exactly how I want it, I just need a text editor. 
 For whatever reason, I made the switch from VSCode to Doom Emacs about 20 days ago. I knew vim keybindings and stuff already but I didn't use them on a day-to-day basis only on servers that didn't have anything else. I did pick up the evil keybindings quickly and after 2-3 days of installation and setup woes, my javascript editing environment was set up rather well. I started relying on vim-fu for code editing and it's so much more enjoyable (don't know if it's faster yet) than using a mouse. 
 That made me want more modal-based stuff, I wanted my browser to have modal navigation. While I'd never switch to the emacs browser I installed vimium on my chrome and it works rather well. Now, I started thinking it'd be so nice to have a file manager that was keyboard-focused and da-dum-tusss, the penny dropped. Dired, so that's what they mean when they say "Emacs is not just a text editor." 
 I'm in the process of installing mu4e now and I'm slowly beginning to understand things about Emacs that just cannot make sense to you unless you've spent some time with it. I know I heard people say that but I always thought of them as denial-filled ramblings of people who have sunk a decade into learning a tool that's slowly fading. Apparently, not the case at all.

 Authentication is fine, and the directory structure after my specified MAILDIR is created. 
 However, a temp file is not found (because, presumably, it is not created) and an error results.
 The various online guides guides and the Arch wiki don't mention this issue. So, I feel I'm missing something fundamental.
 I tried to ask for help on r/linuxquestions previously but that thread went cold.

No matter what I try, (window-width) will return 70 and that only fits 61 characters. I'm a fan of short lines myself, but this is absurd; especially when most of the people I write with tend to add line-breaks at 70, so I get a bunch of lines with 10 characters or less following.
 So my question is naturally, how do I resize the window of a notmuch-show-buffer?

 I am happy emacs user 20++ years and I have been through many upgrades during the emacs usage. Just to mention that Fedora has been my main distribution ship, which provides the built-in emacs binaries. 
 In my latest upgrade attempt, the results were frustrating, from "emacs" point of view. The update was from Fedora 34 to Fedora 36 with exactly the same setup (gnome,wayland,nvidia driver, .emacs) , so it went from emacs 27.1 to GNU Emacs 28.1 (build 1, x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.34, cairo version 1.17.6) of 2022-07-15
 I removed the *.elc just to be sure and then the blinking "party" started.

It works from the command line so if you invoke sops on and encrypted file it will decrypt it, open the decrypted version on a temp file (located in /tmp/<random-digits>) on your $EDITOR and then re-encrypt everything and delete the temp file once you close the $EDITOR.
 Currently I invoke sops on vterm which opens an new emacsclient instance where I edit my file. I thought wouldn't it be cool if emacs could auto recognize if a file is encrypted with sops and decrypt it on the same buffer. 
 Now the only thing I am having a hard time understanding is how you would go about redirecting sops to open a new buffer instead of whatever your $EDITOR is.

 Changes since v2.7.5:
 Behavior changes:
  
stack build --coverage will generate a unified coverage report, even if there is only one *.tix file, in case a package has tested the library of another package that has not tested its own library. See #5713
 stack --verbose no longer includes the lengthy raw snapshot layer (rsl) in the debug output by default. The new stack --[no-]rsl-in-log flag enables or disables the inclusion of the rsl in the debug output.
  
Other enhancements:
  
Bump to Hpack 0.35.0.
 On Windows, the installer now sets DisplayVersion in the registry, enabling tools like winget to properly read the version number.

 Another workflow I've been thinking capturing the webpage along with its meta-data and then taking a note on that page in an org file.
 I would really appreciate your ideas and any suggestion for a current workflow.

 For anyone who hasn't used it - it can preview completion while typing, pressing TAB can execute the completion or indent - based on the context.
  
While this works well sometimes I'd like to use completion besides dabbrev, configurable based on the context (editing code/comments/strings ... etc).
 Ideally there would be a way to use context sensitive compilation back-ends which I could write & register.
 At this point I'm considering writing my own package but thought there might be some solutions out there.
 Key features I'm looking for:
  
Preview completion while typing.
 Ability to define my own completion functions.
 Non-blocking interface, a single keystroke to accept and keep typing.
  
Does anything like this already exist?

 I don't have the possibility to see this information unless I switch to the emacs window/space.
 Spacebar can display the shell output of some commands. For example, `which`.
 I wonder if I could somehow display the clocking information in spacebar by using some system command outside emacs.

 Any ideas?

 After applying the solution proposed by @tianshuwang, I could have what I need.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I've been writing some go code recently, and found that the eglot/company mode autocomplete performance is awful with large completion lists. Specifically, I'm running into issues when using tcell. Here's an example snippet to show what I mean:
 package main import ( "github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2" ) func main() { tcell.[cursor goes here - `completion-at-point`] } 
 If completion-at-point is run at the position noted above, emacs locks up for several seconds. Based on a profiler report I ran, the lock up appears to happen at common-lisp-indent-function, but I can't find any evidence online that this is an expensive or slow function... I'm a little bit at a loss at how to fix this. Ideally I'd like to just disable indenting around whatever's happening here (since it's happening somewhere deep in the json rpc call). Can anyone else reproduce this problem, or has anyone else seen it?
 Edit: figured I'd mention that this problem disappears with lsp-mode, so I guess I'll be using that for the time being.

 The latest docs are at https://scala-slick.org/doc/stable/.
 How to upgrade
 Upgrading should just be a matter of setting the version to 3.4.1 in your build files. (Or, give Scala Update a try.) However, see the upgrade guide in case any changes do affect you.
 What’s ahead
 Now that 3.4.1 has been released, the top priority is Scala 3 support, G-d willing. There is already a proof of concept by Stefan Zeiger (the original author of Slick), but there is still work to be done to ready it for consumption.
 After that is released, I would like to see Slick evolve freely. There are lots …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Longtime (30+ years) emacs user but not using it the way most folks do. I do ASIC design so my code is mostly SystemVerilog with some Python, makefiles, and shell scripts. I don’t use git, either - instead a rare tool called SOS (https://www.cliosoft.com/products/sos/) designed to integrate with CAE tools. Therefore, lots of packages like company don’t easily work with our setup. Instead, I have Verilog compile lists of files and include directories for a project. 
 Does any know of any project packages that could easily take the compile list files and give us the great features I’m always reading about here? LSP would be amazing since my verification files import many SystemVerilog packages of functions and classes (similar to those in other languages). 
 Thanks much!

 Main changes:
 - cathed and fixed two cases where the behavior of async versions of stdlib functions was different than in direct mode. 
 - Experimental loom support (should be enabled by flag), which supports two modes:
 -- hybrid, where we use cps-transform for async/await and Loom for restoring a form of transformed high-order function arguments. This is useful for the effect systems, were spawning a virtual thread in each interpreter step will still be heavy compared to a function call. 
 -- full, where we use loom instead cps-transform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lets say I want Calc to understand a TeX formula like $\int_a^b f(x) \mathrm{d} x$. Clearly, there are many ways to write this, I could have just written "d" instead of "\mathrm", the integral bounds could be just a single lower index indicating a region, "f(x)" could actually consist of derivatives with the same differential notation as "d x", etc. If I could use Backus-Naur form, I would define a non-terminal like
 INTEGRAL := "\\int" REGION INTEGRAND DIFFERENTIAL DUMMY_VAR
 and then individually handle all of these edge cases in each non-terminal. For instance, I could write REGION to accept empty patterns for indefinite integrals, or to accept just a subscript for regions, similarly for DIFFERENTIAL or INTEGRAND. Instead, in Calc, I have to write a messy rewrite rule to just handle the REGION part, and I am not even sure if the INTEGRAND symbol could be implemented since any integrand having terms that look like $\frac{d f}{d x}$ would prematurely terminate parsing as the denominator would be interpreted as DIFFERENTIAL. It seems to me that Calc is formally incapable of handling these complications, but I may be wrong. Are there ways within calc to implemen the functinality I want? If not, are there libraries that allow me to augment Calc in this way? Failing that, I would be willing to use the Wisent parser generator, but how do I integrate it into Calc?

 My use case is that if I add Chinese text for any reason, the fallback font Noto Sans CJK is slightly taller than my coding font Iosevka which causes every line to shift down.
 Before anyone suggests this, changing line spacing does not address my issue.
 Luckily I probably can work around this by compiling the font with additional vertical spacing myself, but I'd rather just not have to do that every time the font updates.

Maybe I haven't run across the right tutorial, but my impression is that it is a fancy outline maker. Half of the positive things people say about Emacs seem to be about org-mode, but everyone seems to use it in different ways, for different things. Ironically, org-mode is daunting in its breadth the same way that Emacs itself must be for new users. Are there good resources that can explain the philosophy and applications of org-mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[outli is a simple outliner mode based on the built-in outline-minor-mode which makes it easy to outline, fold, navigate, and restructure your code, documents, or other buffers. It offers nice headline styling, org-like speed-keys, imenu support, and more.
 If you've used outshine, it's inspired by and similar to that, but much simpler:
  
More focused: 1/30th the LOC
 Better default headline styling (IMO)
 Automatic and easy to configure headline prefix patterns, which can be different per mode
 Adds only one buffer-wide binding (Shift-Tab, for headline cycling)
 Close adherence to org speed-key bindings
  
Note that outshine also supports editing of comment-blocks-as-org-syntax (via outorg) and many other legacy features.

 For the context, I'm trying to build a I'm an indent-based syntax for blocks: instead of having #+begin_theorem ... #+end_theorem , I would like to write Theorem.

 EDIT: The cleanest way seems to extend org-element (as #'org-indent-line is looking for it when intending items), but how?

 Does anyone have any useful agenda tips about what I may be missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm still struggling with the endless task of printing emails in Emacs. Now I had the idea to use pandoc to convert the HTML mail (or mail wrapped in HTML) to PDF. But I can't find any command (user-level or elisp) to access the HTML part of an email from within notmuch-show. I can store attachments, but the HTML part is not offered for saving. And looking at the code, notmuch seems to relay on mm-view and other stuff for which I could not find documentation. So, basically, my question is: what functions can I use to access the HTML part of a mail within the notmuch-show buffer so that I can pass it to a process?
 EDIT: 
 It's mm-dissect-buffer. When called wrapped within with-current-notmuch-show-messsage, you get a list of mm-handle objects defining the different parts of the mail viewed. To save the part, you can use mm-save-part-to-file. There is even a search function mm-find-part-by-type. 
 I'm down in the rabbit hole now! :)

 I don't care about how dangerous auto-updates are because I only use good packages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 To preface this post, I am currently using Emacs within the terminal within VSCode, since I hate LSP mode in terms of how damn hard it is to configure something that even compares to VSCode. Trust me, I've been through most configs and setups, and nothing 'just works' and is a complete mess.
 That being stated, I went ahead and thought to then just use Emacs in terminal anyway since I use it for Org Mode notes anyway for work and would rather use VS Code for web development projects with intellisense out of the box (React, vanilla JS, Ruby, etc).
 ​
 With This In Mind, I Have The Following Issues:
  
Issue Using 'M-x RET' to launch 'vterm' on MacOS
  
So on MacOS, I do the following key combo swaps:
 - Swap Caps with Ctrl
 - Swap Option with Command
 ​
 However, when I try to use my existing key combination on MacOS to launch 'vterm' with 'M-RET' that works already works on Linux (Manjaro), I get the following:
 M-RET is undefined 
 A related snippet from my config can be found here:
 https://bpa.st/XLNQ
 ​
  
Using 'M-w' quits out of VS Code 
  
Anyone who uses Emacs knows that 'M-w' is used to copy a selected portion of the buffer into the copy and paste clipboard.
 However, when I do this action, it quits out of VS Code.
 Does anyone know how I can nuke this default behavior of VS Code to allow Emacs to just utilize it going forward?
 ​
  
Using 'M-f' and 'M-b' does not go back and forward
  
When I use this in VS Code, 'M-f' brings up the 'Find' search bar.
 And 'M-b' toggles the ability to show and hide the Explorer window.
 How can I adjust this so that Emacs is given the ability to use 'M-f' and 'M-b' normally?
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i am puzzled by this function using maybe. the function is supposed to return the value inside a Maybe value, that is if there is one in the value and if not, a default value. I feel like it is simple. I understand how the Maybe function is defined but i am having the hardest time. 
 this is what i have currently but i have had many variations that feels the same, using let and in. i guess there is something missing that i am not understanding but ive been stumped on it. is this something where using a wildcard would be better? i do think using fromJust is the way to go.
 i had something working where it would return the value from the maybe value, but when the value was Nothing, it wouldnt return the default value given as it should. And since then i have gone through so many variations that i forgot what it was. 
 any help or suggestions is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having a rough go at making my bespoke modeline. It's gotten a lot better in performance but now I'm noticing a "creeping" performance leak.
 It's most noticeable when I tangle org files or open up my agenda. Both of these operations get progressively slower and slower until I have to wait several seconds just to have a look at my task list.
 I went into my config and commented out my modeline setup. Without even waiting for things to get worse I noticed these operations were way snappier.
 I've been told that:
  
Avoid doing evals in your modeline
 Avoid expensive functions if you are doing evals
  
I don't believe any of my function calls are expensive per-se. I am doing some weird stuff with cached git statuses and I may be rendering an SVG icon for god mode. I do have god-mode on by default.
 I'm guessing that somewhere in the background lurks a billion ever-exapanding buffers, temporary or otherwise, that are needing to eval their git project status and render an svg icon.
 Anyway, at this point I'd like to distill my modeline down into simple, colorized text. Maybe with a gap between left and right sides (already got this). I'd take any advice I can get.

I (think I) followed the instructions in the README correctly but the behavior I'm getting is nothing like I see in the videos. Basically, I do (the bound key for) projectile-find-file and then in the minibuffer I start typing the name of a file that's in the current Git tree and...basically nothing interesting happens. No autocomplete, no suggestions; nothing. The prompt is [xxx] Find file: (where "xxx" is the name of my Git repo), as I'd expect.
 (This all is using the Emacs on MacOS that I got from https://emacsformacosx.com/ in case that matters.)
 Can anyone help tell what I'm doing wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently decided to give org-mode and org-babel a shot as a notebook (think jupyter). I have a cli program that takes two text files as input. Currently, I've put those text files in a #+begin_src text block, with a tangle. I then have a #+begin_src sh block taking two filenames as input variables that invoke the cli program with the filenames.
 The current workflow thus ends up being:
  
don't forget to tangle the input files
 invoke the shell block
  
Ideally I'd like to somehow configure it such that invoking the shell block will auto-tangle the input blocks, or something to that effect (if there's an option to put them in a temp file and present the filename to the sh block, that's also fine). Is this something that can be done somewhat straightforwardly?
 Secondly, currently I have the following tangle instructions on each input file: :tangle (org-in-tangle-dir "file.txt"). The filename to tangle to is identical to the #+name: file.txt preceding the block. The org-in-tangle-dir function is defined as follows:
 (defun org-in-tangle-dir (sub-path) "Expand the SUB-PATH into the directory given by the tangle-dir property if that property exists, else use the `default-directory'." (expand-file-name sub-path (or (org-entry-get (point) "tangle-dir" 'inherit) (default-directory)))) 
 Is there any way to tell the tangle to use the #+name attribute as filename to tangle to?
 Thanks for any help

 data RegisterData = RegisterData { email :: Email } 
 I need RegisterData to have a Data.Aeson.FromJSON instance, which means Email needs one too.
 I have 3 choices:
  
Add the instance to User.hs. However, it seems wrong to me to add an implementation detail to the "pure" type; furthermore this wouldn't work if I were using types from an external library (such as UUID)
 
Add the instance into Api.hs; this compiles, but is an orphan instance
 
Have email in RegisterData by a Text instead, but this loses the type safety of the Email type.

 I tried to find a solution to this question on my own for quite a while now. I'm rather certain that I am also phrasing my problem the wrong way, because it is impossible that it is that hard to find.
 I want to write a function that opens my org agenda file(s) in buffer(s), operates on said buffer(s) and then saves them. More concretely, I want to have org-sort-entities sort my todos.org file every time I used org-capture (using org-capture-after-finalize-hook).
 I am grateful for both pointers and complete solutions. As I said, for some reason I can't wrap my head around the way emacs opens files when it doesn't happen upon my initiative.
 Have a good day, fellows :)
 SOLVED: I was able to solve the problem! Thanks a bunch, u/MitchellMarquez42 and u/EternalMigrainity!

 However, I read that one problem of Evil is that it can interfere with Emacs keybindings (perhaps only in some modes). Is there such a problem with Boon and Meow too?
 If you have experience with these packages, can you comment on why you picked one over the other? I am a Dvorak user, if that matters.

 I have a simple problem which I haven't found an elegant way to solve. How do I get deadlines (or anything else for that matter) in org-mode to react dynamically to the value of variables? for example:
 - I have 5 shirts in my office (which I visit infrequently), that is noted on my org-file:
 - shirts x5 
 When shirts x5 becomes shirts x2, I'd like something similar to the following task to be generated automatically:
 * Priority_projects ** Iron shirts and pack in work bag :home: SCHEDULED: <2022-09-17 Sat> 
 I've been having a play with tasker (on Android) and shell commands, and can grep lines into variables and then change things like tickboxes with sed. I'm finding dealign dynamically with the current date very tricky.
 There must be an easier way?

 but as of this morning (emacs 28.1.50 with packages-update) this didn't work anymore and I am not sure how I broke it.
 Googling and debugging around I could make it prefix-map work via use-package like this : 
  (:prefix-map my-avy-map :prefix "C-j" :prefix-docstring "Counsel" ("j" . avy-goto-char) ("C-j" . avy-goto-char) ("g" . avy-goto-char-in-line) ("w" . avy-goto-word-1) ("e" . my-avy-copy-word) ("L" . my-avy-just-copy-line) ("l" . avy-goto-line)) :bind-keymap ("C-j" . my-avy-map) 
 I am just surprised this broke (nothing breaks on emacs usually :D) and I am not sure if it's still the right way

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been trying really hard to get C indentation correct, that is, the K&R style.
 I thought I got it right, but I found out that the default value of c-basic-offset was 5 on my Mac! It was fine on my Linux machine (running Manjaro) though. So I had to manually set it to 8, and now I'm quite happy with my setup.
 The following is the relevant config: ```lisp (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil) (setq-default tab-width 8) (setq backward-delete-char-untabify-method 'hungry)
 (setq-default c-default-style "k&r") (setq-default c-basic-offset 8) (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook (lambda () (setq indent-tabs-mode t))) (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'lsp)
 ;;(use-package smart-tabs-mode ;; :ensure t ;; :config ;; (smart-tabs-insinuate 'c))
 (setq whitespace-style '(face tabs tab-mark trailing)) (custom-set-faces '(whitespace-tab ((t (:foreground "#636363"))))) (setq whitespace-display-mappings '((tab-mark 9 [124 9] [92 9]))) ; 124 is the ascii ID for '|' (global-whitespace-mode) ; Enable whitespace mode everywhere `` I had to comment outsmart-tabs-mode` due to some weird error on my Mac, tho.
 But I'm still curious about that c-basic-offset. Any idea where this random value of "5" came from on my Mac? Can it be different in each distribution of Emacs?
 (FYI, I use the same configuration file for both my Mac and my Linux machine.)

 I kept looking for a list of major-mode hierarchies, so I could decide, for example, which hooks to tie into (prog-mode, I'm looking at you). I couldn't find such a list, so decided to write a little tool that builds the hierarchy of major modes, and threw in standalone and minor modes too, along with help links, a docstring, and a flag indicating the origin of the package. 
 More than 700 modes here, with some interesting finds. special-mode? Who knew?

where it is performed. Hermeticity is a prerequisite for generally desirable
features like remote caching and remote
execution. While certain build systems, such as Nix,
impose hermeticity through their design, others rely on their users to do
the extra work and be vigilant to get it. Bazel enforces hermeticity to some
extent, for example through sandboxing, but is less strict about it than
Nix. In this post I’m going to try to enumerate most ways in which
hermeticity of a Bazel project can be compromised.

One source of inhermeticity is the file system. If tools, such as compilers,
are invoked in a way that does not limit their access to contents of the

 Of course there is modal editing, see https://github.com/mrkkrp/modalka#other-solutions= . But most (all?) of them keep keybindings similar to the original ones.
 Personally, I'd like keybindings to be oriented at the things which the commands operate on, e.g. server, frame, window, project, directory, file, block, region, line, word, cursor. I'd love to have an elisp package which allows me to dedicate a key for each of these things, e.g. I'd dedicate "a" to "server" because with my current keyboard-layout, I type "a" with my pinky which I don't want to use so often and because I don't expect Emacs-server related commands to be called often. I could then type C-a and thus get access to many server-related commands, e.g. I could call "server-start" with C-a s. Then there'd be some easy mechanism to enter and stay in hydras, so that you don't need to type the prefix every time. E.g., the SPC key could toggle that behavior. And apart from these hydras, there'd be one-shot actions available, e.g. C-s for search, as is.
 TLDR: Did anyone make a hydra-hierarchy for all Emacs keys?

If I print this, my printer will hang with an error as it is expecting A4 paper, but we only have letter paper (8.5x11in). I finally set down to try and figure out how to change this today.
 It turns out, there is no simple option! This paper size is determined by the ODT style file that is included with an emacs/org distribution. One option is to explicitly define a custom style in the top lines of the org document itself, but this starts to get very messy quickly. I think the future solution needs to be a switch or setting to integrate with the ox-odt export functions, but that is for another day.

 I've been using the org-mode citations a bit, and it's been great. I don't know when (maybe yesterday?) citations just stopped working on me. Even running emacs -Q doesn't do it. This is what the headers look like in the file of interest:

 When I run org-export-dispatch and then l o (LaTeX, open PDF) I get the message:
  org-cite-store-export-processor: Unknown processor csl 
 This was working like three days ago. What gives?
 Org-version: Org mode version 9.5.4 (release_9.5.4-17-g6e991f @ /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/org/) Emacs version: GNU Emacs 29.0.50 (build 1, aarch64-apple-darwin21.6.0, NS appkit-2113.60 Version 12.5 (Build 21G72)) of 2022-08-15
 I'm using elpaca as a package manager, but I don't think that's the problem because this still happens when I open the file and try to export with emacs -Q.

Simplicity, of course
You can list files using 'nb list' or just regular 'ls'
Lots of commands to query, list, move, rename, etc. Some of these I find much easier/faster than standard bash commands.
Multiple notebooks
You can auto-sync w/ git repos
You can specify your favorite command-line editor (I'm currently using vim)
Bookmarks, to-dos, tasks, linking
Wiki-style links!
You can browse your links across files/notebooks
Written in Bash!
On the web site there is a section on Zettelkasten as well.

I've spent more hours fighting with the vague error messages than writing code and it's making me want to quit and go back to a language with brackets and semicolons, where I can see exactly what the mistake is.
 Is there a better compiler than the GCH thing that everyone recommends? Or a way to make it more verbose?
 Take this message and code for instance which I've been trying to debug for an hour now:
  Couldn't match expected type ‘[a]’ with actual type ‘(Int, [a], [a])’ • In the expression: foldr go (0, sourceList, sourceList) indexes 
 hs permute indexes sourceList = foldr go (0, sourceList, sourceList) indexes where go :: Int -> (Int, [a], [a]) -> (Int, [a], [a]) 
 Why doesn't the compiler say 1. which function expects the type - is foldr, go, sourcelist, indexes? 2. which parameter in the function expects the type? 3. which part of the call is the 'actual type'?

 I can throw that up on melpa as ox-slack2 (or whatever) but it seems more appropriate to try and contact the maintainer of the original and either get them incorporated there or take over its maintenance. So, I'm reaching out to you all to see if any of you know how to reach him and could dm me the info, or point him at this post.
 The guy behind it is Matt Price. He teaches / taught at the University of Toronto. I've explored various rabbit holes but none of them seem to lead to anything with an email / working twitter / anything else. 
 Assuming that doesn't work, I have it in my head that it might be technically possible for me to replace his package on melpa without his permission? If so, it seems like a jerk move, but one that may be appropriate in this case. Any advice around how to proceed if i can't contact him would be appreciated. I'm not sure how situations like this are normally handled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all use "C-f" to move letter forward, and probably "Meta+f" to move word forward. I don't like "M-f" as I don't find it ergonomic enough, so I'm sticking to "C-S-f" (ctrl+shift+f). Which isn't perfect too (doesn't even work in my terminal, only in GUI Emacs), but at least I use two pinkies and then I press "f" to move word forward.
 But... what I'd really like is to press "Ctrl+f", then release "f" and *then* press 'w' to move word forward and be able to press "w" as many times I want until I release "Ctrl".
 Is it possible in emacs? Does it have a name already?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I've been thinking of a repository/database with snippets of code for Emacs. With utility functions and commands we put in .emacs, but are not big enough to put in a library. Centralized, classified, tagged, browsable from Emacs, maybe the web too. 
 Is this a good idea? Is there something like that already? If not, do you have ideas on how to implement? 
 I know there's the EmacsWiki, but it's not quite the thing I'm looking for.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I write my blog with Zola, a static site generator written in Rust, but I'm also an emacser, so I wanted to export my org-mode files to Zola's markdown and set up an org-centric workflow. 
 In order to do that, I searched for a solution outside but I saw no libraries. So, I thought I could tweak the wonderful ox-hugo exporter, which cover most of the needs in the "org to markdown" field, being it thought for Hugo (another static site generator which works parsing markdown files). I'm a newbie in emacs lisp, so I'm sure there are more elegant ways to achieve what I did, but my solution was forking ox-hugo (in ox-zola) and hacking it to make it compatible with Zola needs. 
 There were some minor differences that made the exported broken, but now it should work by default. More specifically, I added this Zola-relative features:
  
Custom frontmatters parameters
 Lastmod/updated tags
 Taxonomies
  
I'm already using this library in production for my blog for a while, so I thought this could be the moment to share it with everybody. If you need this exporter, please use it; if you want to add features, feel free to make a PR.
 Thanks to all of you for this lovely community, I leave the link to the repo below.

 I'm not new to emacs but new to both programming and emacs lisp.
 I wanted an org agenda view that would not only show me TODO items with a specific priority tag (#A, #B, #C) but also include corresponding dates in the agenda's header line (#A=today, #B=tomorrow, #C=week).
 It turned out that this was not very straight-forward, but I managed it using only internal functionality:
 (defun current-time-tomorrow () (let ((now (current-time))) (list (car now) (+ (cadr now) 86400) (caddr now) (cadddr now)))) (defun date-list-today () (let ((date-dmy (reverse (nthcdr 3 (reverse (nthcdr 3 (decode-time))))))) (list (cadr date-dmy) (car date-dmy) (caddr date-dmy)))) (defun current-week-mon () (let* ((day-of-week (calendar-day-of-week (date-list-today))) (diff-to-week-start (* 86400 (cond ((zerop day-of-week) -1) ((= day-of-week 1) 0) (t (- day-of-week 1))))) (now (current-time))) (list (car now) (- (cadr now) diff-to-week-start) (caddr now) (cadddr now)))) (defun current-week-sun () (let* ((mon (current-week-mon))) (list (car mon) (+ (cadr mon) (* 6 86400)) (caddr mon) (cadddr mon)))) 
 Obviously, since I'm a programming noob, I'm proud to have achieved that without the help of knowledgeable reddit people. I just realized that I could have used alphapapas ts library, which would've sped up the resolution of the issue considerably, lol. Yet, I'm still wondering if there would have been an easier way, using only emacs' builtin functionality, to achieve this. 
 Have a good day, fellows :)

 Im super new to haskell so please don't bully me too much lol.
 Ok so... defining functions goes for example like this correct?
 functionC :: Integer -> Integer
 functionC num1 = functionB(functionA(num1))
 And I read that the second line in haskell is usually shortened using the "." operator to this
 functionC :: Integer -> Integer
 functionC = functionB . functionA
 But im confused as to how the second better version would know what the input is? functionB gets its input from the output of functionA.. but where does functionA get it from? I didnt give functionC any parameters nor am I calling function A to give it parameters right?

 Did you like the YAML-like look of fewerBraces extension? Then take it to the next level, with Yamlike - left-pad sized library, that provides customizable DSL that looks like lists in YAML.
  
Bonus for ZIO 1.x users:
 Automatically build your dependency graph from unordered list of ZLayers. Just like ZIO 2.x does it with provide macro.
 zio.provideLayers( - layer1 - layer2 - layer3 (...) ) 
 Here is a diff of usage in a working app.

One issue I'm having is org-roam keeps opening every note in org-roam-directory. I close them, do some work, and suddenly they're back. I kill them, close emacs, reopen it, and BAM they're already there without me even doing anything.
 My current org config: ``` ;; ------------------------------------- ;; ORG-MODE ;; -------- ;; Custom startup stuff (defun mmacs/org-mode-setup () (org-indent-mode) (auto-fill-mode 0) (visual-line-mode 1)) ;; ;; org-mode (use-package org :hook (org-mode . mmacs/org-mode-setup) :config (setq org-ellipsis " ▾" org-hide-leading-stars t org-startup-folded t org-return-follows-link t)) ;; -------------------------------------

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I often want to write down "records" (ie. collections of key-value pairs) in orgmode and have not yet hit upon a canonical way to do it...
 Evidently there are many ways to do that (and no single right way), so I simply wonder how other people do it - and maybe learn from their reasons of why they do it one way vs another way.
 As an example I want to make a note of a new email-account I have registered:
 I want to record the email-address itself, the password, a recovery-code and the date.
 How would you represent this in org-mode?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know, that this was discussed some years ago, but this feature is one of those I would expect to be in haskell, when I was studying it, but it isn't. Considered example (https://wiki.haskell.org/Infix_expressions):  xs `zipWith (+)` ys  is not unique. What's about  a `sumMod m` b = (a + b) `mod` m  for addition by modulo m? I don't think this syntax sugar makes code more readable like using functions in infix mode in general. And I don't see any problems with misunderstanding it. Of course, if someone will right huge expression in infix mode it will be unreadable, but it can be said for a bad-styled code without any syntax sugar too. So I don't understand, why it's not implemented so, what's reason to restrict infix behavior to function names only?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It just so happened that all this Akka stuff happened the week before I needed to do the licensing & security talk in one of my other classes - a software development studio class taught in Java, but given I also teach a Scala unit I gravitate to talking about Scala stuff a lot.
 Anyway, here is my (waffly/uncertain/etc) take on trying to use the Akka licence change as a case study to explain to second year undergrads some of the social implications that get packed into that tiny line of sbt code "libraryDependencies += ..." (and the equivalent in gradle).
 https://echo360.net.au/media/b9b8b8c1-90c6-41a3-bf92-8426309a5cc5/public 
 With many thanks to everyone who's been discussing this so openly. And many apologies if I've mischaracterised anything - it's certainly not my intent to express "rights or wrongs" - the motivation here is that we have to teach our software classes about ethics and security, and this seemed a very interesting (and fairly accessible) case study to introduce that topic to a class where I've mostly been talking about code, testing, version control etc. Using a library that I taught some of the students last trimester.
 Posted also because it's an admission of why I've been replying in the comments more than usual on this even though I'm just some unheard-of academic in a small town - I had a class to write, so had to think about the topic more than usual last week.
 So this is me doing a first take on trying to introduce the social impacts of dependencies to a (small) Australian class. Feedback welcome, especially if I've mischaracterised anything so I can correct it for the future. [But even comments like "you really should stop saying 'kind of' as a verbal tic so often" welcome]
 (PS: I'll probably delete this reddit post after a month or two, so that years down the track, some old lecture of mine isn't lurking in public. Maybe sooner if it turns out I've accidentally made a big faux pas anywhere in here!)

 When I connected it asked me if I want to accept the servers fingerprint. And that was that, connected. I never connected to this machine before, so it certainly has no ssh keys from me. In fact the WSL I was doing this from didn't even have a ssh Gen generated. 
 Using Tramp in emacs with C-x C-f /ssh:x.y.z.ip:/ it asks me for a password. Problem is, I don't know the password.
 So, I tried generating a ssh key on my WSL machine and transfered it into /home/root/.ssh/authorized_keys, but that didn't help either. SIC! about the directory (although I don't not know if I did something wrong.)

 I'm looking for some advice for the next steps in my career. I hope this will not be considered too off-topic.
 I entered the software industry in July 2021, so a little over a year ago, after doing a full-stack bootcamp based on Java 7. Totally OOP-ish apart from some Java 8 taught at the end of it.
 Funnily enough, while still doing the bootcamp something drew me into researching more about FP. I started reading SICP, and changed from Vim to Doom Emacs thinking I would be forced to learn some Lisp. And I remember reading these discussions about monads and stuff I was really far from understanding at the time.
 My first job was actually as an OutSystems low-code developer, for... reasons. However, around September 2021, I decided I would learn Haskell, in my own free time. I k…]]></summary>

 I am wrapping some FFI code, by writing classes where the methods map directly to the imported functions, for which bindings and instances are generated. 
 Some of the functions are for managing and converting foreign arrays. In particular the functions for creating the foreign arrays have the (slightly simplified) form newArray pointerToValues dim0 dim1 dim2 ... dimN so the number of dim arguments differs depending on the dimensionality of the array. 
 Now, one way to solve this is to generate a 'uncurried' version of that function and giving the dimensions as a tuple, but I want to maintain a minimal amount of generated code, and like the idea of mapping methods directly to the imported functions.

 I use emacs but im not very advanced but my initial reaction to this tweet was think it was bs and that the professor wasn't very experienced in emacs. I didn't know he was a professor until after I responded. he said he's been using emacs for 23 years. I asked him what made him believe that and he said that in vscode he can install extensions that resemble the functionality he was use to in emacs.
 ​
 if you have used both emacs and vscode is this true? is he not as experienced despite all the years he has used emacs?

Nix is a package manager with a focus on reproducible, declarative and reliable packages.
Nixpkgs is an enormous collection of software packages that can be installed with the Nix package manager.
Due to the way Nix works, all packages must define precisely all of their dependencies (their dependency closure) down to the operating system’s kernel.
This rigor-by-design with respect to dependencies is what makes Nix packages highly reproducible, and as a side effect, it gives us a fantastic dataset: the full dependency network that the more th…]]></summary>

 P 'Z is stuck, and P is closed, so I don't know how we could ever have an equality constraint that makes it equal to 'Z. Similarly, we can't construct a singleton SN (P 'Z). But I'm not sure how to convince GHC of this fact. I expected q2a to work, but GHC thinks we are missing some case branches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a little hard to discuss because emacs and tmux use the term 'window' differently, but in tmux the window is basically your full terminal. So, your terminal might have 6 'panes' across 2 'windows' in a session, with one window containing 2 panes and the other four in a second window. Rather than be in separate floating program windows in your DE though, tmux windows are not visible until you cycle to them. So your setup might look like:
  ________________ _________________ | | | | | | | | | | vim | node | | st | python | -> :next-window -> |________|________| | | | | | | | | | | watch | ranger | |_______|________| |________|________| 
 Is there any way to get this functionality (multiple buffers laid out in different ways in one wm box that can be cycled through) in emacs? (I'm focusing on the GUI version of emacs for now, not particularly interested in running emacs inside tmux at the moment)
 edit: another thing I'm looking for is the ability to toggle 'zoom' an emacs window to fullscreen and back to its place, which I believe is 'c-b z' in tmux

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question: How can I make the unicode glyphs in vterm prompt look the same as they do in my OS terminal. 
  
emacs: GNU Emacs 29.0.50
 vterm: 20220831.835
  
I'm using zsh with xfce4-terminal. 
 My OS prompt is configured using the powerlevel10k theme.
 I have 2 separate configurations for p01k, one for my OS and one for inside emacs. This is copied verbatim from the vterm repo 
 My .zshrc vterm configuration
 I believe it's working because I can see visually that it's different from my OS terminal and when I run p10k configurein an emacs vterm buffer, it prompts to save to bin/p10.emacs.zsh
 The main difference i those 2 p10k configs is that the one for emacs has no prompt on the right hand side - I've given up all hope of getting it to work in vterm. 
 vterm is working but there's one problem. The unicode glyphs in the prompts look different.
  
OS prompt example
 vterm prompt example 
 It appears as if the line height in emacs is a taller than the font size. There is an unappealing strip of background colour above the font making it look as if the glyphs don't align. Whereas they match perfectly in the OS terminal. 
 Any ideas for how I can fix this so that they look the same and I can have an aesthetically pleasing prompt in vterm?

Both modules define error handling functions like try, handle and catch, and the later one has more specific function for IOError: handleIO, catchIO and tryIO. I am curious about them and want to see their documents. While I can easily find Control.Exception's module by Google, I cannot find the module Exception's. I have tried out several searching keywords but none of them brought me meaningful results.
 P.S. I was also wondering why there are two modules for error handling, what are histories behind them?

 Concerning Julius Caesar's military communications, Roman historian Suetonius
 wrote: "If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, and by
 so  changing  the  order  of the letters of the alphabet, not a word could be
 made out."

 TLDR: I would like to continue my learning journey, replacing a Rest Service with a new library in order to get experience with Scala, I don't know if Akka HTTP worth with their new license change.
 I'm a software developer with almost 4 years of experience, I've been developing on Python for the latest years, working on data gathering & cleaning, a little bit of machine learning, and some Rest Services with FastAPI.
 Since some couple of months I've been using Spark (Mostly DataFrames) for processing, Since then I fall in love with Scala and Functional Programming in general, I can not see the opportunity to implement high order functions, recursion, pattern matching in everywhere (I think even the way I think problem-solving have change).
 I've taken the Scala & FP Essentials  and Spark Essentials with Scala from RockTheJVM and I absolutely loved! 
 Now I'm feeling that I would like to switch my career more orientated into Scala and functional programming, I feel I could improve some of the Rest Services in my current job replacing it with Scala, but I haven't seen a roadmap or something like that to use it for learning purpose. 
 I was reading about Akka Http, but I don't know if does it worth to learn with new changes on their license (TBH, I'm only understanding that will be oriented in business), which library or framework should I learn? In my current job there is no tech team behind to report so I could choose whatever stack as long it is free to use. 
 Thank you for your advices and reading this post!

 I have a folder (org-directory) where I organize things like: ledger (to accounting), elfeed (as my RSS feed), notes (as my second brain/note taking tool), and other things like daily notes and a note to manage my current tasks.
 How could I sync it between devices, like my notebooks, my smartphone and other possible devices?
 For smartphone I was thinking to use Termux + Syncthing, but exists something better than it?

 As the question below is part of homework I would greatly appreciate pointers as to what I'm doing wrong, but I'd rather not be given a complete solution. Even though I'm sure there are way smarter ways of approaching this 'simple' task. 
 Context
 The task is to write a function that takes a list of any type of element and shuffles it by first taking every other element and then repeating it on the rest of the list. For example given the list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] should output [0,2,4,6,1,5,3].
 To solve this I wrote the following function:

The problem is that my play project is on verison 2.13.5 and library supports only up to 2.12. I tried to install 2.12 version in ineliJ idea and changed version in build.sbr but then there was compilation problem because of two versions of scala that I didnlt know how to solve. Can someone recommend some simple library or code for using jwt in scala?

 I am writing a library and I am wondering about my package name. My old Java instincts tell me to use ext.domain.project (e.g io.github.iltotore) but I often see imports with only the name of the project like in Haoyi ecosystem (mill, os (os-lib), utest ...), Cats or ZIO.
 Actually, my package name is a bit long with the ext.domain.project model but I am worried by potential name clashes.
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing with the Brick terminal UI library and hit an interesting hurdle. Roughly, brick represents the program logic as two functions Event -> State -> IO State and State -> Image.
 I have some non-trivial IO (loading and parsing files, possibly transitively) which should not block key inputs. We can launch some async IO and send the results into an event queue which Brick reads from. But it is really annoying:
  
The update function must know which async resources to load, duplicating parts of the rendering logic
 The update function must track which resources are already loaded
 The update function must track which requests are in-flight, or have failed
 Optionally, the update function may have to cancel requests that are no longer needed
  
That's quite a bit of complexity for a simple update function! My approach so far has been Haxl-like. There is a function CoreState -> IO AppState which is run after every event is processed, and it re-loads all resources. Requests are represented by a GADT, and cached in an MVar wrapped map. A functionsend :: MonadAsync r m => r a -> m (Maybe a) retrieves the existing result, or starts a new request unless one is in flight. When a request finishes this queues an event so Brick updates.
 This solves some of the complexity issues but still feels kind of ad-hoc. Shouldn't Haskell be better at this sort of thing? Is there some existing approach to this?
 The only idea I had so far is some kind of declarative IO. The render function produces an Image, and the frame-work diffs images and produces some imperative commands to synchronize the world. Maybe the render function also could produce a sort-of free-monad trace, the trace is diffed, and the framework performs some imperative steps to ensure the minimal necessary requests are performed? But for diffing to work trace would have to contain which case-statement branches were taken, not sure how to do that without compiler support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been learning haskell through multiple sources (one being a free online course) and I've gotten to learning about monoids. However, I'm still struggling a bit on understanding typeclasses.
 I understand a typeclass is similar to, say, an interface in Java or c#, in that typeclasses can be used to define things that work for all classes that define an instance for said class (similar to implementing an interface). But I don't fully understand how the type signatures work, or when to use a vs b in polymorphic signatures. 
 For example, I can define a typeclass
  class Foo a where prev :: a -> a next :: a -> a 
 But I don't understand how that would differ from the same typeclass defined as:
 class Foo a where prev :: a -> b next :: b -> a 
 To put this another way, I'm fairly sure I understand the theory, but I don't know how to apply it very well.
 (All that said, I'm loving my time with learning haskell. Such a great language.)
 (Sorry for formatting. Don't understand how to do multi-line code on mobile)

Is haskell-mode still the go to package? 
 
Are there any issues with lsp-mode or is it recommended that I configure haskell-mode?
 
What is a good way to use ghci repl in emacs? I have ghcup installed.

 I've just tried dumping my Emacs after it loads packages and is configured.
 Like this:
  emacs --batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(dump-emacs-portable "emacs.dump")' 
 Then I start my already configured Emacs:
  emacs -q --dump-file emacs.dump 
 Emacs starts a lot faster this way.
 Why are we Emacs users not taking advantage of this? Or this is well known already?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the beginning of 2022, we decided to get rid of Akka at work and built our own alternative to the last bit of Akka that didn't have a good alternative: sharding (more details on our motivations and architecture choices in a talk I'm planning to do later this year).
 After 6 months in production we decided to release it as an open source library called Shardcake: https://github.com/devsisters/shardcake (it was coincidentally made public a few hours before the Akka licence change announcement).
 In a nutshell, Shardcake makes it easy to distribute entities across multiple servers and interact with those entities using their ID without knowing their actual location (the entity behavior and persistence is entirely up to you, the library only takes care of the distribution and messaging). It exposes a purely functional API based on ZIO. It was designed to be simple to use, lightweight (unlike Akka, nodes do not form a cluster) and customizable: you can change the messaging protocol, the serialization, the storage layer as well as the source of truth for pod's health.
 It's been working great for us, so I hope others find it useful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been working on my hobby programming language and there's three things I want to write for it: a type checker, type inference, and a program synthesizer. While writing each of these I realized there was a lot of similarity in the code to the point that it almost felt like the same thing three times. I realized if I was working in Prolog I could probably express this as typed(term, type, errorList) and then I could get supply a term and a type to see if if type checks, a term and an empty error list to infer the type, and a type and an empty error list to get program synthesis. It would be nice to be able to express this relation in Haskell with a similar style and elegance but I'm not sure if it's possible since I'm not sure if I can do logic programming with similar levels of optimizations in Haskell. logict doesn't seem to do any kind of optimization and I'm guessing this would make my code unusable in practice.
 Is my assumption that logic programming without optimizations is unusable in practice correct? Does anyone know if it's possible to do logic programming in Haskell that has performance comparable to Prolog?

 ​
 Is there any way to quickly create them? Yasnippets doesn't seem to work well since I use three different input-modes, japanese for the kanji, japanese-hiragana for the reading and nil for the meaning.
 ​
 I created the following function:
 (defun jane/latex-footnote () (interactive) (let ((my-input current-input-method)) (set-input-method 'japanese) (let ((kanji (read-string "What's the kanji: " nil nil nil t))) (set-input-method 'japanese-hiragana) (let ((reading (read-string "What's the reading: " nil nil nil t)) (footnote (read-string "What's the footnote: "))) (insert (concat "\\edtext\{\\ruby\{" kanji "\}\{" reading "\}\}\{\\Afootnote\{" footnote "\}")))) (set-input-method my-input))) 
 It does work, but I do need to type the kanji twice. Once for the kanji, and twice for it's reading. Is there any way to improve my function?

 I've been using Doom Emacs for about a year. I want to learn Emacs Lisp. The advice I've read is to solve an actual problem I have with Emacs Lisp. But my mind draws a blank when I think of problems I'd like to solve.
 What have you written elisp for recently? What problems have you solved by writing an elisp function or mode?
 Thank you.

I think if I'm able to accomplish this I should be able to handle switching contexts from the wm back into emacs on the wm side, but I don't know much about elisp hooks and advices yet, could someone let me know at a high level what's the best way to implement this?

Servant's Handler type is newtype Handler a = Handler (ExceptT ServerError IO a), and what I'm struggling with is the MonadIO and MonadReader constraints required by the logging function.
 For context, here are some of the type signatures involved:

 Lacking real-world resources has often been acknowledged in this community. Although we've come a long way, there's still a lot of room for improvement.
 For a while I've been thinking of starting a movement of sorts to help collect and organize various Haskell patterns and tricks from the real world. Harnessing the full power of my originality, I've decided to name it the "Practical Haskell Bits" initiative.
 More details in the blog post:
 https://dnikolovv.github.io/practical-haskell-bits-initiative/
 repository
 This is still a "proof of concept" idea and I'm not really sure where it'll end up. Nonetheless it seems worth thinking about.

Here is my usual workflow: first of all I load the beancont.el file (the mode isn't available on melpa) with load-file, and I get this: Loading /home/sgrc31/personal/finanze/beancount-mode/beancount.el (source)...done ,then if I try to load my "main.beancount" file i get the aforementioned error.
 Here is the backtrace: https://pastebin.com/pQ9c5MA2
 \ I already tried to start emacs without my config (with the -q switch), but the problem persisted. It may also help to say that I used beancount mode without any issue for several months, and all of a sudden this problem occured 3 weeks ago. This morning I updated all my packages and cloned the beancount mode repo afresh, but nothing changed. How can I fix this? Thanks for your time

If I start Emacs the 1st time it starts dead center. Thereafter it moves ever so slightly to the right of my screen. It does this a few times before starting in the center again. I would always like it to start in the same place.

 I am seeking for a way to specify the placement of the buffer named *toc* created by AUCTeX's reftex-toc-function in a side-window via display-buffer-alist. I tried it as shown below; however, this does not work, unfortunately.  (setq display-buffer-alist `( (".*\\*toc\\*.*" ;; reftex-toc (display-buffer-in-side-window) (window-height . 0.25) (side . right) (slot . 0)))) 
 Do you know how I could achieve a specific placement of the *toc* buffer?

 I use emacs in linux and win10 as well.
 I would like to discuss about win10 deploy, because I should install:
 - a release from here: https://github.com/kiennq/emacs-build
 - a release from the gitforwindows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
 because the magit handle itt well (emacsclient not found problem if I use msys2 package)
 - deploy the msys2 and install: diffutils, ripgrep and it is necessary for the dired and ripgrep-mode, consult ...
 - I should clone my configuration from github and start emacs and clone the mode's repositories (I use straight ...)
 - I have to set the PATH and HOME envvars
 So it is not easy to deploy to a new computer.
 My question is that do you know any project or manual description about how I can copy these ones to a directory and create a zip file what I can download and unzip and it works what I want ? :)
 I can make this folder I have idea but I just would like to know is there any project about this ... ?
 My plan is roughly that I will copy everything to the .emacs.d folder and create a powershell script to set the $Env:vars ...
 folders:
 - ~/.emacs.d/bin/emacs.exe|emacslient.exe|runemacs.exe|git.exe ...
 - ~/.emacs.d/mingw64/bin ...
 - ~/.emacs.d/usr/...
 - ~/.emacs.d/straight/repo|build ...
 - ~/.emacs.d/install.ps1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider memoization. A monomorphic top level definition will be evaluated only once over the bustle of a program. So, one can retain the values of an expensive function in a top level map, so that they do not need to be recomputed: memory ∷ Map Int Int memory = Map.fromSet expensiveFunction domain However, this polymorphic variant will be evaluated many times — the values will not be retained: memory ∷ Num α ⇒ Map α α memory = Map.fromSet expensiveFunction domain This polymorphic definition can be specialized by the compiler for‍ some special cases that can then be retained. Memoization will work only when this specialization is performed. So, disabling optimizations will spell death to a program that relies on memoization of a polymorphic function. Are there any other examples of compiler optimizations changing asymptotic complexity? * * * P. S. See also an example of how inlining affects memoization nearby.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a Scala object that calls other Scala objects. When we run our unit tests they fail due to our Logger object not being properly initialized. Ideally, I would just mock out the Logger, but I am not sure how I can do this since I am testing an object which has no constructor to provide dependency injection and what I need to mock is itself an object. I am completely new to Scala and very unfamiliar with unit testing with Scala. I know Scala objects are basically static classes / singletons which do not lend themselves to being unit testable. However, I am currently tasked with writing unit tests for a bunch of Scala code our team was given. Is this even possible to do without re-writing the existing code to be classes rather than objects?
 object MyObject { def myMethod() : Unit { // do some stuff Logger.logInfo("Some message") // Logger is also a Scala object } }

 ​
 This is more of a random question as I try out various Modal editing schemes. I currently use Meow and While I enjoy it I will be trying Xah fly keys soon as well. 
 ​
 In regards to Meow (or even boon) how worried should i be of the project being unmaintained and my keybindings one day breaking. Should I move towards evil stuff or is this really just overthinking things. for example I know God-mode was depreciated.
 ​
 TL:DR: should i worry about alternate modal editing styles maybe eventually being depreciated, or is it overthinking?

 I'm currently looking for alternatives. I heard a lot about zio and typelevel, but I was hesitant to switch over because they seemed overly complicated. I'm talking about for maintenance, stability, and hiring purposes--not for learning (I used to geek out on Haskell before I learned there was a difference between writing something as a hobby project and writing something for industry).
 Has anyone used these libraries in production at a large scale? What are your recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love both evil and isearch. However, I have a hard time combining evil operator keys (e.g., d c y) with isearch. 
 ​
 When I call isearch in the evil operator state, the operator states quits before isearch activates -- the cursor point is indeed jumped, but the operation is NOT completed. For example, when I pressed "d c-s abc", the operator state quits first, and then the cursor moves to "abc". The content between my old point (before the search) and "abc" is not deleted. (I don't encounter this issue when I combine the v key for visual selection with isearch)
 ​
 Does any one have any idea how to fix this issue?
 ​
 P.s., if it matters, I am on emacs 28 + doom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam Derbyshire has a cool type-checking plugin called if-instance that lets you branch on whether a constraint is satisfied with the following interface:
 -- 'IsSat cls' returns True if 'cls' is satisfied, and False otherwise. type IsSat :: Constraint -> Bool -- | 'dispatch @cls₁ @cls₂ a b' returns 'a' if the constraint 'cls₁' is satisfied, -- otherwise 'b'. type (||) :: Constraint -> Constraint -> Constraint class cls₁ || cls₂ where dispatch :: (cls₁ => IsSat cls₁ ~ True => a) -> (cls₂ => IsSat cls₁ ~ False => IsSat cls₂ ~ True => a) -> a type IfSat :: Constraint -> Constraint type IfSat cls = cls || () -- 'ifSat @cls a b' returns 'a' if the constraint 'cls' is satisfied, and 'b' otherwise. ifSat :: IfSat cls => (IsSat cls ~ True => cls => a) -> (IsSat cls ~ False => a) -> a 
 Now the catch is, anyone can add an instance at any point because of the open-world assumption and this will change the behaviour of your program if the branches are functionally different. This plugin basically goes against the design of type classes but sometimes that is what we want. One safe use of this technique is to branch on extra-functional properties such as space, time, energy like choosing HashSet a if Hashable a is satisfied.
 But let's not only stick to safe use cases, what application can you think of for this plugin??

 Previous TODOs from days before show up, just not new ones. If I put a TODO in a day before it broke, it works and shows up. It is just the last two days oddly that don't work. They are all in the same directory, and named with the same convention. 
 I still have (setq org-agenda-files '("~/org-roam/daily")) in my init.el and have not changed it. The directory is correct. 
 Any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had luck binding ESC to keyboard-quit everywhere except in terminal sessions with the following line: 
 (when (display-graphic-p) (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "ESC") (kbd "C-g")) 
 But recently I've started making more regular use of the daemon and this hasn't worked really anymore. (From what I understand, upon first starting the server, display-graphic-p returns nil.)
 The workaround that seems to be doing the trick is to add the above to server-after-make-frame-hook. (I tried adding the above to after-init-hook but it doesn't seem to work, and some poking around suggests that when the functions in after-init-hook are run when the server starts, display-graphic-p also returns nil.)
 Now, there are other things I want to run only when starting a new GUI session, so I've kept on adding things to server-after-make-frame-hook. 
 Not knowing very much about the way all of this works, I keep thinking this is inefficient. For it seems that server-after-make-frame-hook gets called more often than just when I start what, on my end, looks like a new session: calling magit-commit, for example, will run all of the functions in that hook. 
 So, what I'm looking for is some tips on how to activate some bits of my config in all and only the following circumstances: when a new GUI frame is opened but no other GUI frames are. 
 One solution I would be happy with, but which I cannot figure out how to create, is to have a GUI dedicated daemon and another daemon, if needed, for terminal sessions. I'd then need to have a way of triggering some bits of my config only when the dedicated GUI daemon starts. 
 Sorry if this a bit muddled. As I write this I suspect I'm confused about something, I just don't quite know what it is!

Dijkstra Comparison: Looking at the Library Function by Monday Morning Haskell
Today, we’ll look at the API for a library implementation of this algorithm and compare it to the implementations I thought up.
Linear Combinations of Applicatives by Sonat Süer
On a given type constructor of the appropriate kind, there is at most one Functor instance and it can be derived automatically. There is no analog of this for Applicatives.
More recursive definitions by Joachim Breitner
Haskell is a pure and lazy programming language, and the laziness allows us to write some algorithms very elegantly, by recursively referring to already calculated values.
nix-serve-ng: A faster, more reliable, drop-in replacement for nix-serve by Gabriella Gonzalez
Our team at Arista Networks is happy to announce nix-serve-ng, a backwards-compatible Haskell rewrite of nix-serve. It provides better reliability and performance than nix-serve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have for a while been wondering how I can get an overview of my org-journal entries. I would like to list all entries say for the last two months.
 Here is a way to do it: customize org-journal-search to do regexp search instead of plain string search.
 (customize-set-variable 'org-journal-search-forward-fn 're-search-forward) 
 Then one can search for all entries for the last two months by executing
 M-x org-journal-search giving search string "^\*\* " and starting date -2m and end date the empty string (just hit return).
 Something to be aware of is that if one gives org-journal-search an empty search string, it will search for "** " which will not work as intended with regexp search. It is probably not a good idea to change the variable org-journal-time-prefix which defines that string. Just avoid entering an empty search string.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I whipped up this function to save all buffers in the current project, e.g. before executing a compile/test command:
 (defun ct/project-save-all-buffers (&optional proj arg) "Save all file-visiting buffers in PROJ without asking. Falls back to `project-current' if PROJ is not specified." (let* ((proj (or proj (project-current))) (buffers (project-buffers (project-current)))) (dolist (buf buffers) ;; Act on base buffer of indirect buffers, if needed. (with-current-buffer (or (buffer-base-buffer buf) buf) (when (and (buffer-file-name buf) ; Ignore all non-file-visiting buffers. (buffer-modified-p buf)) ; Ignore all unchanged buffers. (let ((buffer-save-without-query t)) ; Save silently. (save-buffer arg))))))) 
 The filter for file-visiting buffers and getting the base buffer for indirect buffers was added thanks to /u/whhone sharing a function in: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/u09yf9/ignore_save_if_buffer_isnt_visiting_a_file/
 Alternatives that are simpler: override asking to save before compiling:
 (let ((compilation-ask-about-save nil)) (my compilation command here)) 
 But that would save all modified buffers unconditionally. Similarly, you could call:
 (save-some-buffers t) ; Save without asking (my compilation command here) 
 What if you don't want to save changes to, say, some .org file that you edited in the meantime?
 I prefer to be asked for unrelated files, so I added my function above and call it in this sequence:
 (ct/project-save-all-buffers) (my compilation command here) 
 Feedback welcome, and enjoy the function if you need it! Didn't find something like it for some reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like completion frameworks on the featureful/heavy-weight side a lot. I use helm and use helm actions heavily to accomplish things within a completion session (e.g. moving files, grepping). However, the more I use it, the more I think: it would be much better if it's a full dired!
 I like the multiple column view of `helm-buffers-list`. It in fact just imitates the native `list-buffers`, but in a pretty hacky way (it use spaces to pad each completion items to make it look like a table). I've written my own `describe-functions` and `describe-variables` sources that uses similar hack to give me a column of function argument list/variable value and documentation. It would be much better if we just use `tabulated-list-mode`, or some blend of it and the native `*Apropos*` buffer!
 In general I feel like lots of functionalities are implemented twice, once as a "feature-full" package, once as a simplified version in helm.
 My question is then: Is there any completion framework based on the idea of wrapping "feature-full" package out there? Do you think this is a sensible idea?
 I haven't looked much into other popular completion frameworks (ivy, vertico, etc), because I get the impression that they're typically at the more "light-weight" side of helm so are probably not what I want. Feel free to correct me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very happy to announce the release of Copilot 3.11. Copilot is a runtime verification system implemented as a Haskell DSL that generates hard-realtime C99. You can learn more about it at [1].
 Copilot 3.11 introduces a new library, copilot-interpreter, that isolates all functions related to simulation of Copilot specifications. The release also contains a number of bug fixes, provides a simplified API, deprecates outdated elements, removes unused code, and introduces support for GHC 9.2. A full list of changes merged is available at [2].
 A substantial effort is being made to achieve NASA's Class D software classification, most notably in terms of development process (which you can partly witness in how issues and PRs are being handled on our github repo), test coverage (mostly with quickcheck), and proofs of correctness of the generated code (with what4).
 Copilot is being used by the Safety-Critical Avionics Systems Branch (D320) of NASA Langley Research Center to conduct experiments related to flight safety of aerial vehicles. We have also built Ogma [3], a tool that allows us to generate full monitoring applications (e.g., NASA's Core Flight System [4] and Robot Operating System [5] applications) from requirements in structured natural language.
 We invite you all to explore Copilot, to try it, and to extend it. If you like it, please help us draw attention to this work with a star on github or a mention online.
 Happy Haskelling,
 The Copilot Team

 I'm following this page: https://www.orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-scheme.html to get scheme running in babel but I can't make it work.
 This is my config:
 (use-package geiser) (use-package geiser-mit) (setq geiser-active-implementations '(mit)) (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((scheme . t))) 
 And this is the org file:
 #+header: :session #+begin_src scheme (+ 1 1) #+end_src 
 when i hit C-c C-c in the block i get "Code block evaluation complete" in the echo area but no results under the #+RESULTS: and i'm redirected to the geiser REPL the first time (i don't kill this buffer i just switch to the org buffer after it), i also get a buffer *Geiser Messages* whith the following content:
 ​ ERROR: <1>: continuation failed "(geiser:eval '#f '(begin ;; -- geiser-scheme-implementation: mit -- (+ 1 1) ))" (error Selecting deleted buffer) 
 Does anyone now how can i solve this problem? 
 PS: I'm using emacs 28.1 with org-mode version 9.5.5 and the geiser REPL works correctly when i run M-x geiser

 EDIT: SOLVED! SOLUTION BELOW
 Hello, I do a lot of data analysis and visualization, for which literate programming is an exceptionally good paradigm. I mostly use org-babel and ESS-R in Spacemacs, but am recently making another run at trying Clojure.
 I've been able to get a lein project up and running with an org mode document and it does a fine job executing chunks and outputting text and data tables, but I can't seem to get it to output in-line graphics links automatically.
 Here's some demo code that seems like it should work:

 Long-time (30+ years) emacs user but not a programmer so can only do simple elisp functions. I use ediff all the time and have ediff-diff-options set to -wBb. This works most of the time but I've gotten burned diff-ing some Python scripts and the occasional makefile since whitespace matters there. Anyone have some code that would automatically change ediff-diff-options based on the buffer mode? I guess that means it would have to be a local setting.
 Thanks for any pointers / ideas!

I find it very confusing and hard for these first days. Can someone recomend to me some good videos for scala/play framework. Also I’m a lot confused by feature, map, imutability of everything, and json as well. I’m used to just sending json object, but in scala that doesn’t work when something is feature. In summary I’m confused about everything as hell, so any kind of help would be great. Project is small but since I’m new to this language every new line I write I got some problems and I don’t know how to solve them.

 I'd intended it to fill the more advanced than org-agenda search, C-c a s niche.
 But it's fast and accurate enough that I now almost exclusively use this to search through my (120K+ lines of) org-mode notes. Hopefully some of you folks find it useful too 😇
 Features: Fast, Natural Language, Open Source, Private and Incremental
 Quickstart: pip install khoj-assistant && khoj

I post now because I can't find definite answers.
For the longest time I have been adamant in trying to make my Zettelkasten work in my profession and so far I've been using it to:
But I just feel like I haven't truly gotten the potential output I can get from the system.
I know that Zettelkasten is geared towards writing and not necessarily visual output but I just want to ask advice on how to implement the system to maximize output for non-writing purposes. Am I doing something wrong or am I applying Zettelkasten to something it wasn't meant to do?
Looking forward to interacting with all you more (hopefully, my introversion won't get the better of me.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I have noticed a strange behavior in Emacs when setting the default font:
 I noticed that when using set-face-attribute, the font gets overridden. I tried with a blank init file and I discovered that it happens due to the line (require 'use-package). If I call set-face-attribute before that line, everything is ok, but if I call it afterwards, the font gets overridden to the default font of the system.
 Moreover, if I use (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "FONT")), everything works just fine, regardless of where I declare it.
 Anyone knows why this happens? 
 I have noticed that David Wilson from System Crafters calls (require 'use-package) and sets the font by set-face-attribute later with no issues, so I don't know why my system behaves otherwise.
 By the way, I get the same behavior in Kubuntu and in Windows 10.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My girlfriend has no computer or even programming background, and the only time she needs to write some programs is to write a little bit statistical analysis code in R. Basically, she just copy-paste from the Internet, and she even struggles to write a for loop. 
 But recently, she saw that I use orgmode, and very interested in the integrated smooth workflow of using orgmode for GTD+note-taking seamlessly. Now I am ready to bring my girlfriend into this hole, but now I have several problems as follows.
  
My girlfriend uses a windows computer, and I have not used a windows computer for six or seven years except to play games, so I don't know how to configure it under windows at all. emacs is known to have a relatively average experience under windows.
 
I am using doom emacs, except for the most basic operations such as C-bpfnaehk which are adapted by macOS as global shortcuts, I do not know the native shortcuts of emacs at all. My girlfriend had a slight experience with vim, mainly because I introduced her the vim mode in rstudio, she knows yiw, ci} stuffs like basic operation, but she usually mainly uses office, vim mode is just rarely used, and not skilled.
 So if I introduce it to the pit, I'm not sure to introduce her to install the classic vanilla emacs (surely a distribution that uses vanilla keybindings, such as centaur? or the vanilla version of doom?) Do you guys think it's better to let someone who knows a little bit about vim but is not very skilled use vim mode, or let her learn emacs' weird ancient vanilla shortcuts?
 
Finally, a broad context question, do you guys have any suggestions for smoothing out the introductory curve for someone with little computer background (or even little programming background) to use emacs?
 
 Thanks for your help and I would be much appreciated it for any help and advice!

 and I'm trying to get it to do ligature functionality with Operator Mono adapted for ligatures. I've been following the FiraCode instructions, but they should do pretty much the same thing.
 The problem is whenever I start a new instance of Emacs, it doesn't render in the operator mono ligature font at first, it goes to another one. When I specify regular operator mono in the menu, it renders, saves, and new instances load just fine. The ligature operator mono, renders perfectly with the ligatures if I if set the default font in the menu, but new instances of emacs don't load the font.
 The emacs --debug-init returned literally nothing.

 Please be nice as I'm new to emacs

 I have 700+ note files, and agenda was taking a bit of time so I decided to optimize it. This is what I set my org-agenda-files to:
  (defun dm/get-active-agenda-files () (let* ((shell-output (shell-command-to-string (format "ag -l -r '\\*\\s+TODO' %s |grep -v 'archive' | grep '\\.org$'" org-roam-directory)))) (split-string (substring shell-output 0 (- (length shell-output) 1)) "\n"))) 
 Not sure why I'm using both ag and grep, but essentially listing all of the files that have a * TODO in them as well as an .org extension.
 It's been working well and has improved my agenda performance. 
 I am hitting some weird edge cases though. Specifically, not all :ID:s are being resolved now. Is it because not all my notes are part of org-agenda-files?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs Mac port is YAMAMOTO Mitsuharu's Mac port of GNU Emacs.
 I have been trying to use doc-view on djvu files which resulted in this traceback (I have trimmed it down for relevant informations)
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 3) 1) doc-view-multiplex-conversion(...) doc-view-djvu->tiff-converter-ddjvu(...) ... 
 Where I found the procedure in question is doc-view-djvu->tiff-converter-ddjvu, with an ill-defined form:
 (defun doc-view-djvu->tiff-converter-ddjvu (djvu tiff page callback) "Convert PAGE of a DJVU file to bitmap(s) asynchronously. Call CALLBACK with no arguments when done. If PAGE is nil, convert the whole document." (doc-view-multiplex-conversion (lambda (tiff callback &optional resolution) (doc-view-start-process "djvu->tiff" "ddjvu" `("-format=tiff" ;; ddjvu only accepts the range 1-999. ,(format "-scale=%d" (round (or resolution doc-view-resolution))) ;; -eachpage was only added after djvulibre-3.5.25.3! ,@(unless page '("-eachpage")) ,@(if page `(,(format "-page=%d" page))) ,djvu ,tiff) callback) tiff callback))) 
 The problem is that tiff callback are enclosed within the lambda and not part of the funcall to doc-view-multiplex-conversion. Applying this change fixes the problem for me.
 Interestingly, upon checking the [https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/emacs-28/lisp/doc-view.el](doc-view file) at emacs 28 github mirror, they are slightly different definitions, where the mac-port has wrapped it with doc-view-multiplex-conversion.
 Naturally I could not find any place to raise this issue. Because firstly, I am not very used to usingreport-emacs-bug and the mailing list. Secondly, this is related to Emacs mac port not exactly Emacs (see my point just above). So here I am, wonder what actions I could take to make this get noticed and fixed.

 This tool is inspired by article : Global interactive Emacs functions. It provides an idea to run Emacs functions outside of Emacs.
 So I try to use this idea to wrtie a tool like lauchbar or Alfred. It can help user to quickly lauch app or run work flow.
 I’m using it to replace the lauchbar.
 Pros and cons
 This tool has some pros and cons, and I think if you have the following needs, you can try to use it :
  
you don’t want to pay for other tools like lauchbar or Alfred.
 you wish some function in Emacs could run out of Emacs.
 You’re familiar with Emacs, there are some plugins, and custom functions that you want to reuse.
 You don’t want to learn a new language or workflow of a new software
 …
  
Pros

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm Using Scala(2.11) and playframework(2.3) and trying to run a query using a helper function to get results through pattern matching. The function is as follows 
 ​
  def resultsfunc() = { val gradeRegex = "^Class 5\." val currRegex = "\.NCERT$" DB.withConnection{ implicit c => val filterQuery = SQL( """ select * from tbl_graphs where graph_name REGEXP '{grade_regex}' and graph_name REGEXP '{curr_regex}' and org_id = 4 """) .on("grade_regex" -> gradeRegex, "curr_regex" -> currRegex) filterQuery().map{ graphRecord => new ResultObj(graphRecord[Long]("id"), graphRecord[String]("name")) }.toList } } 
 ​
 I don't get any errors but I get empty result even though there are multiple records that match the pattern. The same query works if I try to run in mysql workbench and when I tried to print `filterQuery` the arguments were also mapped correctly.
 ​
 Should Pattern matching with regex must be carried out differently in Scala Anorm ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago I discovered that my emacs was hanging when trying to edit tables in org-mode. I did some investigation, created a stackoverflow issue (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/72769/38541), got help from the org-mode mailing list and eventually created a bug in the evil-repository for what I guess is the root issue for the behaviour (https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1642).
 It's been a bit more than a month now, and nothing has happened, yet the problem persist for me, even with the latest versions of evil and org-mode. However I can imagine that a lot of users use both, evil and tables in org-mode. And as a consequence, more people should stumble upon "my" issue and report or support it. So that makes me wonder if there is indeed something wrong in my configuration.
 As you can see in the stackoverflow issue, there is not a lot minimal configuration needed to reproduce the issue. But could there be any other package, configuration, switch, whatsoever that I could add in my configuration that would solve the issue?
 So my question is: Am I missing something here? Is this actually a problem on my side? Or do other people suffer the same problem, but it has not caught traction yet?

 I really do like keeping the setup with one file per day, so I wonder if there's a way to open multiple org files in a single buffer?
 A writable buffer where changes end up in the correct file would be perfect, but a read-only buffer would be more than acceptable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT / CLARIFICATION: This question is not intended to be about programmatically sorting a list of filenames, but is rather a quest to find an Emacs library / package that facilitates a user to manually rearrange a list of filenames in an arbitrary order and then return the modified list as a result.
 I'm using pdftk to combine various PDF files, and am looking for a mechanism to assist in manually choosing the sort order. The command line for combining PDF files looks like this:
 pdftk file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf cat output single_document.pdf 
 Starting from a dired-mode buffer, I can select various files and obtain a list with dired-get-marked-files. From there, is there a mechanism / library that can let me manually choose the order and return a new list sorted accordingly?

 On the other hand C-c C-c and typing LaTeX (which is what think C-c C-a does) works perfectly with no issues.
 Btw, i have checked the major mode and it is LaTeX/P and not Plain tex mode.

 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version in a couple of weeks.
 Changes since v2.7.5:
 Behavior changes:
  
stack build --coverage will generate a unified coverage report, even if there is only one *.tix file, in case a package has tested the library of another package that has not tested its own library. See #5713
 stack --verbose no longer includes the lengthy raw snapshot layer (rsl) in the debug output by default. The new stack --[no-]rsl-in-log flag enables or disables the inclusion of the rsl in the debug output.
  
Other enhancements:
  
Bump to Hpack 0.35.0.

 One annoyance I couldn't fix is the helm buffers not being colorized properly. I attached 2 images as example below, when running helm-buffers-list in the two machines. I checked some helm faces with describe-face and in the info buffer the (sample) text displays them correctly, but I never played with faces in emacs so I don't know what else I could check. 
 One important thing is that, IF I'm not crazy, sometimes this problem doesn't happen, like 1/10 times. It only started to bother me now that i'm using it constantly to navigate files in a project.
 Could someone give some tips on how can I debug this issue, what should I look for, where? 
 Windows 10 / Ubuntu 20.04 / emacs 28.1 with native comp.

 I've been a vim user for 2yrs now. I've jumped from vim->neovim->lunarvim. I've also tried out other text editors like kakoune and helix. I liked kakoune a little better because of the editing model but can't use it due to the lack of plugins. I like helix but it lacks some features but the best part is that it is really well built and feels very robust unlike my current LunarVim setup.
 I've been seeing people moving from vim to emacs. Their talks and reviews sound very mature, yet I seem to ignore them by thinking why would one use emacs rather than modal editing? Modal editing is so much comfier and faster. Also, I have the advantage of editing my keyboard layout using kmonad so using symbols in vim is fast for me too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just starting my journey with Scala.
 I know a bit of Rust and there they have syntax sugar for unwrapping their equivalent of Try. It would look roughly this way:
 def foo(): Try[Int]; def bar(): Try[Unit] = val v: Int = foo()? ... def bar_unrolled(): Try[Unit] = val v: Int = foo() match case Failure(f) => return Failure(f) case Success(v) => v ... 
 I.e. question mark operator is equivalent to this `match` statement in `bar_unrolled()`.
 Does Scala has any sugar for working with `Try`-s? Right now a lot of my code is just these match statements. The two popular use cases for the Try are "propagate error or return value" as in the example and the second one that I have in a lot of cases is "wrap and propagate error or return value", i.e. the same but with a different `Throwable`

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all, using doomemacs on NixOS I have trouble getting tramp to work nicely through zsh with projectile/magit/etc. I have read this section of the emacs wiki about zsh but none of the options given there make zsh work with tramp. Currently I have:
  if [ $TERM = "tramp" ]; then unset RPROMPT unset RPS1 PS1="$ " unsetopt zle unsetopt rcs # Inhibit loading of further config files return fi 
 So I have to resort to sshx which works but then magit fails to find git, projectile can not initialize project caches and many other unpleasant things. I have tried the following settings in various combinations to no avail:
 (setq projectile-file-exists-remote-cache-expire nil) (setq projectile-enable-caching t) (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path 'tramp-own-remote-path) (setq-default projectile-indexing-method 'alien) (setq tramp-connection-properties '(("/sshx:server:" "remote-shell" "/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh") ("/sshx:host:" "remote-shell" "/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh") ("/ssh:server:" "remote-shell" "/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh") ("/ssh:host:" "remote-shell" "/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh") ("/ssh:user@host:" "remote-shell" "/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh") ("/sshfs:" "direct-async-process" t))) (customize-set-variable 'tramp-encoding-shell "/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh") (setq tramp-terminal-type "tramp") 
 Any ideas what else I could try?

 I'm trying to do citations. I set bib file in the org document, and I do citations like [cite:@OrgCitations]. When I export, this doesn't get processed. I also included #+print_bibliography: but this doesn't get processed either.
 I guess the problem is probably my config file? I've been looking at the following resources, but didn't find what I guess I'm missing (maybe too obvious for most emacs users? or maybe I missed it?): how to tell my .emacs config file to load org-cite.
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Citations.html
 https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-07-31-citations.html
 https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202206141852/#configuration
 Here's what I'm trying in my .emacs :
  
;;;;Org-cite config 
 ;; enable org-cite 
 (require 'oc) 
 ;; set bibliography file 
 (org-cite-global-bibliography 
 '(/home/steve/orgcite.bib))
  
When I try to load this (M-x load-file and hit enter twice) I get this error:
  
eval-buffer: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-cite-global-bibliography
  
What am I doing wrong here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a trait Action[Result] that represents a serializable value that is used to decide which piece of code should be ran producing Result. Something of a marker for the event based runtime. I then extend it to describe all the action I have
 case object FetchData extends Action[Something]
 case object ProcessData extends Action[List[Int]] 
 case object PublishResults extends Action[Unit] 
 and do something along the lines of
 def runAction(action) =>
 case FetchData => FetchData.implementation(???) 
 case ProcessData => ... 
 Now I can describe sequence of action having all the information about the types
 val myAlgo: Sequence[Something, List[Int], Unit] = Sequence(FetchData, ProcessData, PublishResults)
 Simple enough
 I now want to describe the dependancy of an action on the results of a different action or some env
 trait Action[Input, Result]
 case object FetchData extends Action[Nothing, Something]
 case object ProcessData extends Action[Something, List[Int]] 
 case object PublishResults extends Action[List[Int], Unit]
 So now Sequence(FetchData, ProcessData, PublishResults) compiles and Sequence(FetchData, PublishResults) does not.
 I will not post code here but I achieve it by mimicking function composition.(since Action[Input, Result] is basically representation of a function)
 Now what I want is to able do describe the exact same thing but with the ability of an action to describe the dependancy on any number of previous action in a type-safe way ie
 Sequence(FetchData1, FetchData2, FetchData3, ProcessFetchedData, ConsumeTheDataOfFirstFetchAgain PublishResults) compiles because FetchData1 happens before ConsumeTheDataOfFirstFetchAgain
 I think this can be done via macros but I really dont want to write custom ones.
 I am not familiar with shapless so I dont know if something from there could help 
 So does anyone have an idea on how to do things like this? If they can be done even? Maybe some paper I could read?

 There's a cool package named hl-prog-extra which lets you write regexes for highlighting some things extra specially. In comments, I wanted words surrounded by backticks to be highlighted like GitHub or lsp-ui-mode do. My init.el contains:
 (setq hl-prog-extra-list (list ;; Match `symbol`. '("`[^`\n]+`" 0 comment lsp-face-semhl-namespace))) 
 Which gives me cool highlighting like:

 As you can see, everything within backticks is purple, but the words between them are still grayed out. Just thought I'd mention, in case anyone here wants this too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently my Emacs has been taking a very long time to start up — often around 8–10 s, and sometimes more. If I close Emacs and then start it up again, the startup time usually decreases to around 5 s, but then it increases back to 8–10 s after I put my computer to sleep. The really curious thing about this is that whenever I try to run esup or a similar profiler, the problem goes away entirely: Emacs starts near-instantly, and the profiler consistently reports around 3.5 s startup time (all of which is straightforwardly due to my init.el). I can find nothing else obvious which might be causing this delay — and, before you ask, I can’t quite remember when the problem started. Does anyone have any other ideas whatsoever as to what might be causing this or how I might be able to fix it?
 (For reference, my .emacs.d is at https://github.com/bradrn/.emacs.d/blob/bef9de6ad27e214fa5972ed220d839721d8febca/init.el; I am using Emacs 28.1 on Windows 10, without native compilation.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to learn Haskell and found https://4clojure.oxal.org/ very helpful. https://tryhaskell.org/ was also nice, but it is limited in scope as compared to its Clojure equivalent.
 I did find https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/1_to_10 , but honestly, even the first exercise is beyond. It's quite the jump from TryHaskell.org!*
 I did see https://exercism.org/tracks/haskell , as well, but I'm not sure if that's what I'm looking for and I won't know until I make an account. I'd rather not make an account unless it actually provides what I'm looking for.
 * To be clear, what I'm refering to is the provided solution. Yes, I could define myLast to equal last but that seems counter to the exercise.

Yank to clipboard text without the org-emphasis markers used to stylize the text. org-copy-visible copies text to the kill-ring, but I want this behavior in evil-yank. 
 
A way to apply org-emphasis markers around active region (i.e. selected text). I came across this but it doesn't seem to work. I'm guessing it's because I'm using Evil and keys like ~ is bound to other functions in visual mode.
 
 Any help is much appreciated.

 I'm working with emacs for a few years now and I'm tired to run it in ssh inside the terminal, because in a GUI mode for my disability it is more nice and helpful.
 Now, I'm looking for a solution to use in my local machine the emacs daemon that is running in my remote machine.
 I tried to run the emacs --daemon on the remote machine with the following configuration
  (require 'server) (setq server-use-tcp t server-host "<IP>" server-socket-dir "~/.emacs.d/server") (unless (server-running-p) (server-start)) 
 and after I'm copy the .emacs.d/server/server in my local machine and run emacsclient -c but I have the following result
  ➜ ~ emacsclient -c emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server? emacsclient: To start the server in Emacs, type "M-x server-start". emacsclient: connected to remote socket at <IP> Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Could not open file: /dev/ttys000 
 There are any suggestion and update guide on how to make this configuration working?

 Last I've announced a preview of PET. I've received some very valuable feedback over the past month so thank you for giving it a try. I've fixed all the issues reported and the package is now available on Melpa.
 To recap, PET is a new package that aims to take all of your troubles configuring Emacs to find the correct Python executables from virtualenvs away. It supports poetry, pre-commit, pipenv, pipx, pyenv, direnv, plain old virtualenv and pdm, and assigns the correct executable paths to buffer local variables of your favorite emacs packages. It also works for repos that use one or combinations of these tools.
 I hope I can help you delete a bunch of code and dotfiles from your init.el and projects!

 I'm having a bit of tough time in Emacs Lisp, in that I don't see the errors in my code until I run it, ie the lack of compile time checks.
 I just realized that some function calls in some of my code are totally wrong and only failed to notice them because they are lightly used and the code paths were never exercised.
 Are there some techniques to get better compile time checking in Emacs Lisp? I know Common Lisp has some superior tools or techniques for that, but I need Emacs's best.

 def calculateUpcomingOfDaily( from: Long, every: Int, times: Seq[java.time.LocalTime] ): Iterator[java.time.LocalDateTime] = Iterator .iterate( localDateOfEpoch(from).plusDays(every) )(_.plusDays(every)) .zip(Iterator.continually(times).flatten) .map { case (localDate, localTime) => java.time.LocalDateTime.of(localDate, localTime) } ```
 Calling it gives me: ``` // Parse times is a shortcut method, to parse strings using a dateformatter into LocalTime.
 calculateUpcomingOfDaily( 1656676800000L, // 2022-07-01 12:00:00 1, parseTimes(Seq("01:00:00","01:10:00")) ) .take(5) .toList
 res1: List[java.time.LocalDateTime] = List( 2022-07-02T01:00, 2022-07-03T01:10, 2022-07-04T01:00, 2022-07-05T01:10, 2022-07-06T01:00 ) ```
 But my desired result must be:  res1: List[java.time.LocalDateTime] = List( 2022-07-02T01:00, 2022-07-02T01:10, 2022-07-03T01:00, 2022-07-03T01:10, 2022-07-04T01:00 ) 
 This is a great exercise to learn about iterable operations but, I don't know how to generate those kind of combinations.

When I start writing code: c ... int main() { if (a == b) ... }  instead of: c ... int main() { if (a == b) } ...  I get this: c int main() { if (a == b) ... }  Even after inserting a literal TAB character it just goes back to 2. Is there a way to change this behavior so that its auto indenting is 4, possibly globally?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, folks. I started learning Emacs and Elisp about a week ago and it's been a blast.
 I just started adding a handful of simple functions and key bindings to open MPlayer in "slave" mode and control it by piping commands through a named pipe (FIFO). On opening, all of MPlayer's output is sent to the *Async Shell Command* buffer.
 The key-bound functions simply use the builtin "shell-command" to echo MPlayer commands to /tmp/mplayerfifo just as you would from Bash:
 echo "pause" > /tmp/mplayerfifo echo "get_time_pos > /tmp/mplayerfifo 
 I have no use for the output when I'm simply controlling the video, but the output of commands like "get_time_pos" are printed out at the bottom of *Async Shell Command* and I would really like to stuff them in a variable. In short, how might I grab the content of *Async Shell Command* while working in a different buffer? I can work out transforming the text, I just need to get my hands on it. Also, could I clear that buffer after each command?

 val task = Future{ getUserList() } for{ userList <- task user <- userList } println("Result: " + user) 
 However, if an exception is thrown during the getUserList() method, the code will not break but will simply hide it, and the for-comp will not run. I know there are other (and in my view better) ways to handle the results of Futures (like using callbacks that allow checking for Failure), but I'm just wondering about the theory or use case that makes this a best practice or a right choice

 What would it look like to do it the other way around? How would you write Java such that it looks like Scala with worse syntax and ergonomics? Libraries or frameworks you would use for a typical backend stack or general coding (vavr is the one that comes to my mind)? Would you find type classes worth using without implicits?

 I have an odd behavior thing that I can't understand and i have no idea how to debug.
 When I call the function projectile-find-files, it asks me to select a project, I do that and as soon as It opens the buffer for finding the file, in a new buffers open the projectile-file-errors, there are no errors, the output shows that it is running a new shell, the message is repeated twice, it is like it run the shell command twice.
 Is that related to linux command that find-files uses in emacs?
 I attach a picture of the error buffers.

 That is very annoying I want to get rid of it and understand what causes it. I enable the Show log for key presses and commands but I can't see anything wrong and my debug skills are too weak to go further.

 About SimpleX Chat
 SimpleX Chat is implemented in Haskell - we have lots of support from Haskell community - thank you all!
 SimpleX Chat is an open-source multi-provider messaging platform that minimizes meta-data in the communication - it is the only platform we know of that has no user identifiers of any kind (not even random numbers), instead using pairwise connection identifiers (4 per each contact you have, on 2 different servers), making it more difficult to correlate traffic and determine who is communicating with whom.
 This video by The Digital Prepper channel explains how SimpleX Chat is different from all other messaging platforms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKRfDch_WBQ
 Anybody can host the servers participating in SimpleX network, and it is NOT related to or dependent on any crypto-currency.
 See technical details & limitations and FAQ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 There is some strange rendering behavior around shr. When I start reading one of the newer epub ebooks from oreilly using nov.el, in some sentences the whitespace between two words is missing.
 For instance:
 #+begin_example
 Wecan’t stress enough the importance of experimentation as you learn new concepts here and throughout the book.
 #+end_example
 Here, the whitespace is missing between `We` and `can't`.
 So I did checked the xhtml source of the epub:
 #+begin_src html
 <p>We<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="code examples" data-secondary="downloading" id="idm45654236145288"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="online resources" data-secondary="code examples" id="idm45654236144280"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="GitHub, code examples from" id="idm45654236143336"…]]></summary>

I've only been doing react js development lately so that's all I could test. 
  
Code completion and stuff like that are just as good with Emacs + language server as it is with VSCode. Of course, because VSCode developed LSP. But, hear me out here, you might think that Emacs is just the worse choice because I had to seek help from someone when VSCode works right out of the box. For most people, yeah, for me, no. In the process of setting it up, I learned how LSP works, became aware of what language server I'm using, and compared a few. Became awa…]]></summary>

 Do you use OverloadedRecordDot? NoFieldSelectors? DuplicateRecordFields? OverloadedRecordUpdate?
 Do you use lens or optics? If yes, how do you generate the field accessors?
 Could you give examples or link to tutorials?

 My terminology may be off, which might explain why I can't find my own solution.

 Ideally, I want to edit yaml files like Org headings:
  
nice way to collapse/expand
 C-RET to add a new item at the current level
 imenu that takes into account nested items
 jumping to prev/next item at the same level of nesting
 changing the level of nesting (similar to org-metaleft/right)
  
I've been looking through different packages, and I just can't find any good ones. I am almost tempted instead to work on figuring out how to convert YAML to Org and around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some weeks ago, I asked here, if there is a way to let GHC infer backwards constraints from instance declaration, i. e. for instance  instance (A a) => B a where  have not only forall a. A a => B a, but also forall a. B a => A a. It's correct, provided that we have no overlapping instance for B. In answers there were a link to an article on this topic. However, implementation from the article requires essential changes in GHC. I found some way to make this with currently available extensions (mostly type families) with not so much boilerplate and now uploaded it on github with my solution for the first problem from the "Motivation" section of the paper.
 However, I think, it's not quite natural. If this method is general enough and can be automated, it seems me very nice to have an GHC plugin or even GHC extension to make this without any hacks in code. For example, such syntax of class declaration:  class {-# BIDIRECTIONAL #-} A a where  will make all instance of this class bidirectional (and forbids overlaps).
 What do you think about it? More concrete questions: - are there any other (beside this article) conversations about this feature? - does this feature sound reasonable enough to implement it? - what are disadvantages of using bidirectional instances, besides it conflicts with overlappable instances? are the overlappable instances for most of classes (for example common classes from base) really used in haskell?
 I ask this to gather more pros&cons for this feature. If it will considered to be useful enough, maybe I'll try to implement it. Anyway, it's nice for me to learn more opinions about this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I write my notes in org (org-roam style) and have both equations and TikZ diagrams rendered nicely in the buffer using orgs latex preview function. It looks great! 
 However, I wish to export my org-roam web to HTML, and publish this using some kind of SSG such that anyone can look at them without needing a configured emacs. Ox-hugo works great for this except for TikZ diagrams. Regular latex is rendered fine using mathjax, but mathjax cannot handle TikZ, and probably never will be able to handle TikZ. 
 Ox-hugo and ox-html allows one to render latex using something like dvisvgm, however I don't want to use this for general latex equations that can be rendered using mathjax as it generally looks way worse than mathjax, particularly for inline maths. 
 Is there anyway to change the latex ox-html/ox-hugo behaviour for a select number of latex fragments, while keeping mathjax for the rest? 
 Alternatively, is there anyway I can preview the contents of a #+begin_src latex block? If so, I can stick my complex latex math in the src block and have it exported to svg, but still have my beautiful buffer previews. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I cannot afford to switch to emacs for my day job (full-stack dev) and take the productivity hit, but I would like to give this emacs thingy a try for fun and start learning. Eventually I want to try to use it for coding (with new for me stuff like lisp and clojure or even with my current stack).
 So is there some resource online where I can explore 'cool' things to try in emacs?
 Specifically:
  
are there any 'packages' that I must have, that promote learning the commands and key bindings and exploring? e.g. autocomplete, suggestions, recovering from errors, docs etc.
 any pointers on how to do FS navigation in emacs? any must-have packages to help with that
 any pointers on how to do theming? Ideally, to just use some nice theme, with good defaults, not looking for customization at this point. (watched some youtube videos where orgmode looked so much better than mine)
 is theming done per major/minor mode or based on packages or something else?
 any pointers on getting started with org-mode? I am going through orgmode.org rn and got somewhat familiar with the syntax. I am trying to evaluate it and I don't see the value yet. do i need any plugins for it?
 I am confused with the package managers and the options you have and how to import. Is there some rule of thumb I can follow that can help me simplify adding packages? I don't need 'options' right now, I need a 'do it this way, it gets you to 90%'
 I was watching some videos and saw this https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles/blob/master/Emacs.org, which is HUUUGE. Is there some other resource that I can just start with one piece/package at a time and keep adding more slowly?
  
Sorry if this was posted before (it must have, I guess, but not recently), but I am after some specific things. I need someone to take me by the hand cause this thing is deep and wide and I feel lost.
 Also apologies for the long post. ANY feedback is much appreciated!

 For other operations org offers, like breaking down task, if you manually edit the text of checkboxes, you can use #'org-update-check-box-count to make the task progress to be correct. For calculating time interval for a timer, you can have #'org-evaluate-time-range if you directly change the plaintext of the time you start and end a task.
 Is there any similar command for changing the next SCHEDULED time and LAST_REPEAT property?

 So, anyone in here not feeling the need to pick one of the latest releases? Or just happy with the version that comes with your OS, despite it not being 27/28?
 With more prevalent package usage, that might get more problematic earlier than before, where you just missed some new core feature. But I would assume that people doing this are happy with their general config anyway.

 Don't really know is this is the correct place to ask this but here it goes.
 I'm using Doom Emacs and I'm trying to debug some PHP Laravel code using LSP+debug. Remote debugging seems to be working fine but, in Emacs, when I inspect variables there is less information than in VS Code. Noticed this especially in Model instances.
 Below is a screenshot comparison of the same inspection in both Emacs and VS Code.
 As you can see, in Emacs the last entry is escapeWhenCastingToString and in VS Code there are entries for attributes, original, changes, ...
 Have no clue where to begin to fix this... Any help is appreciated.
 Thanks in advance.

 I thought I could try '(unless $2 (org-id-new)), but I get nils.
 Is there a reference for the current cell, or a way to only apply a calculation to an empty cell?

 I am trying to figure out which is better. I used to do evil with Doom, but I decided to try out generic emacs bindings and I enjoyed them . Then I found meow and I like the inbetween'ness of Meow. Which is better for someone who doesnt want to customize all day? For example I probably will be using framework for the rest of my life and dont particularly care to over customize. Should I just keep with the "emacs bindings" or should I keep up with modal editing. OR just decide on the more popular framework because im lazy. 
 Excuse the Ravings Posted this before bed.
 ​
 TL:DR: Should i stick with Emacs bindings or modal. (i used evil/doom) for someone who would rather let someone take the reigns.

 i feel like my knowledge can be improved in getting good performance in haskell. my usual approach to improving performance is using profiteur and optimising the big blocks there. but i don't know very much about when to use strictness annotations or other stuff to squeeze out better performance. 
 also not sure if my haskell is very idomatic since i'm fully self taught. Any books or resources i should look at? thanks

Most of that code produces derivations or packages but occasionally we write small helper functions that are algorithmic in nature. As diligent developers and when appropriate, we should write unit tests to ensure the correctness and maintainability of our code. This post will demonstrate and compare various ways available in the Nix ecosystem to add unit testing to your Nix code — specifically Nix functions.

Minimal Examples
We will start with minimal working examples from 3 different frameworks and then show off some extra features and capabilities. If you would like to test out these examples yourself, you can find them all here.

  Although you were unlikely to have used org2blog-buffer-post-or-page-view or org2blog-subtree-post-or-page-view, you can't anymore. See their function for details. Guessing you were unlikely since the break was never reported.
  Easier to check for compilation errors since long docstrings now get ignored.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few of my students have encountered a problem running HLS 1.7 on Windows 10/11. Their Haskell installations mostly seem okay---everything installed by ghcup (1.8) , and cabal (3.6.2) and ghc (9.2.2) work as expected. However, when VS Code (via the Haskell plugin) attempts to start the language server, it exits repeatedly with error STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND (or its signed integer equivalent).
 Has anyone encountered a configuration that leads to this problem before? Most of the students are not having this problem (nor am I, on similar software configurations), so I suspect it's a consequence of something else they have installed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 Issue:
  
I'm getting this message appear in my '*Messages*' buffer when I visit a Ruby based file with the '.rb' file extension on MacOS:
  
​
 LSP :: The following servers support current file but do not have automatic installation: ruby-ls sorbet-ls typeprof-ls ruby-syntax-tree-ls steep-ls You may find the installation instructions at https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages. (If you have already installed the server check *lsp-log*). 
 What I Have Done:
  
I installed 'Solargraph' via the 'gem install solargraph' command on both my Linux machine (Manjaro Linux) and MacOS machine.
 I made sure to include a change to my '~/.bashrc' config to include the following section on both my Linux machine (Manjaro Linux) and MacOS machine (Macbook Pro):
  
​
 # Ruby specific variables: export GEM_HOME="$HOME/.gem" 
 Current Emacs Config Snippet Containing My LSP Based Config Section:
  
Here's a link to a snippet of my Emacs config that I have using a literate Emacs config in a '~/.emacs.d/configuration.org' file: 
 https://bpa.st/3PQA

 Question:
  
What can I do in this scenario?

 I was thinking to deal with them in the following way:
  
divide them in groups,
 manually sort priority for every group,
 mergesort groups, that is, start merging groups in pairs, and manually sort for every step the union group until I have a large sorted backlog.
  
For this to be practical, I would need an easy way to sort manually a group of tasks and get them assigned automatically a priority (or any other hack) so that priority ordering matchs manual ordering.
 Any idea about how to get this done?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I gave Orgzly a chance, but it doesn't do what I need it to do. I use org-roam to link my notes together, and it would be great if an app recognized org-roam formatting such as backlinks, metadata, ids, and aliases. Also, I'm not a huge fan of how writing to org files requires you to basically fill out a form, I'd much rather edit it right in the editor, in a WYSIWYG fashion. 
 Basically, I want an app like Obsidian but for org files instead of markdown. I know there is also Logseq, but Logseq uses wikilinks instead of org-roam's id-based linking format. 
 Coincidentally, I'm just starting school for Mobile App Development in September. I don't have the skills to make this yet, but if nobody else does, I will for sure once I'm able to.

 But I see exactly the same content in both windows, whatever action I take in one of them. I have verified that follow-mode is disabled. So I am forced to switch back and forth between two running Emacs instances and view one manual page at a time.
 Is this a quirk of Info-mode, or am I missing something?
 I use Emacs 28.1

 I was thinking about this topic for a long time.
 This post has high level technical discussion and some notes about psychology, but it mostly came from thinking about code as something that comes with cognitive effort and that this effort should be kept under control.
 I would like to solicit feedback from Haskell and FP programmers first before I start showing it to a wider audience.
 It is a high level rant that includes quite a bit of FP and Haskell.
 Thank you for taking a look.

Is it somehow possible mixing ordered and unordered list, for different levels, in the same list?
 Use case: Quite often I make lists where the top level is ordered (do these items in this order), but the next level(s) should rather be unordered, as they are more "comments" or thoughts, but having them ordered looks a bit silly, as if "you must do it in this order". Especially when sharing notes with others.
 Desired way of using it, something like:
 1. Item 1 - Sub item 1 - Sub item 2 2. Item 2 - Sub item 1

 Can you explain, how it work, or maybe, you have a link to some simple tutorial specifically about undo/redo.
 I am trying to learn it from the official emacs tour page, but it's confusing.

Scala 3

And of course more will come along later.
 I had been using Akka and Quill before, but it looks like ProtoQuill uses ZIO 2. Okay, so there's ZIO-HTTP for ZIO 2, which covers my HTTP requirements, but the zio-pulsar library doesn't support ZIO 2 yet.
 So I'm not sure which direction to go. I could stick with Akka, but then which Scala 3 database library would I use? I don't think Slick supports Scala 3 yet. Doobie uses Cats.
 This is all quite confusing. Is it just too early to start using Scala 3?

 In my time with doobie, my case classes were simpler, so zero complications, until now. Within my table there's a column "dates", which is a date array. On the Scala side my case class has a field dates: Seq[String]. This is because, the field is read only so the string representation is great. But I cannot figure how to declare the desired Metaor at least Get mapping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, i am learning how to build applications with tagless final pattern. However, I am a bit confused at the moment, that which tagless final approach is the right one. I know there are tons of resources out there which states that in tagless final pattern, we use trait as the algebra with a companion object. Most of the times, developers tend to do the implementations in the companion object as well, or create another class (interpreter) where they implement the algebra's functions. However, I have seen many solutions where the devs replace the trait + companion object combo with class + companion object one. 
 Honestly, I am pretty confused which approach is the right one: 
 // 1. trait + companion object approach trait Repository[F[_]] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] } object Repository { def apply[F[_]]()(implicit ev: Repository[F]): Repository[F] = ev def make[F[_]](): Repository[F] = new Repository[F] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] = ... } } // 2. class + companion object approach class Repository[F[_]]() { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] = ... } object Repository { def apply[F[_]](): Repository[F] = new Repository[F]() }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to use an ECS system in Haskell and I have found apecs and ecstasy. However, both seem to use IntMap for storing component data, so I figured that performance could not be all that great.
 That's why I created a new library, hero, which uses sparse sets for storing component data. Basic benchmarks seem to suggest that hero is roughly 40 times faster than apecs at iterating over components.
 The interface for hero is inspired by apecs, but there are some significant differences.
 The library is still rough around the edges, but you can already find it on https://github.com/Simre1/hero. I have also started work on an sdl2 binding which is in the same repository.
 The end goal for hero is to empower people to make simple games in Haskell, but there is still a long way to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
My professor has shared many cool worksheets and spreadsheets for organizing literature notes for use in my lit reviews. (Thank you, amazing professor!!) However, as I was going through the examples, I found myself thinking, "hey, couldn't I just do this via zettels?"
Here's my thinking: Each worksheet or spreadsheet uses a one-line per article approach. For each article, the worksheet provides space to capture the following:
Authors (year)
Relevant Literature & Theory (Major Points, Topics, Ideas, and Who was referenced?)
Purpose of the study
Overview of Study Design (Method, Variables/Key Concepts, Sample - who was studied and how were they selected, Means of Data Collection?)
Major Finding(s)
Conclusions, Implications, & Limitations
Now, here's how I currently structure my zettels:

I include the citation in the title
I include a "too long, don't read" summary at the top
I write a more expansive entry
I include my own tags for cross-referencing
I include related card links
I include the actual reference
In theory, it should be pretty easy to establish a new template where the top part becomes spots for those worksheet areas. The bottom part would largely remain the same, only the tags would allow me to include things like
Which lit review this is for (creativity & spirituality, agency & organizational transformation, or if it speaks to both)
Findings tags and research method tags (e.g., #creativity-spirituality; #quantitative #survey)
My own brilliant insights and connections
Et cetera.
My questions for this community are:
Thanks in advance for your help with this one!

 How can I customize it so that the error message doesn't break like so?
 Sorry for the noob question, I tried to figure it out and read the documentation provided, but could not do it.
 SOLUTION:
 The issue with wrapping lines is caused when using a fixed font, so removing the value set to font face height solved the issue for me.
 Another thing I tried was changing the font to a non-mono-spaced one, but I decided to stick with the first one.

 I'm converting my bash and zsh configs to a literate org file and finding noweb quite confusing. I think I understand everything in the manual, but my changes keep breaking it.
 In this commit, all I've done is move two blocks from one noweb-ref to another (previously they inherited their noweb-refs from the subtree properties). This was intended just to clean up the org file without changing the output.
 The tangled shell scripts and zsh.toml haven't changed. But bash.toml (which I didn't touch at all!) now includes the #+begin_src and #+end lines of the :noweb-ref prompt-format block.
 I'd be really grateful if anyone could have a look at the diff and let me know where I've gone wrong:

 I've also noticed that sometimes replacing a :noweb-ref header argument with an equivalent #+name makes every noweb reference in the org file expand to the empty string. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for when this happens, but going back to :noweb-ref always fixes it.
 Thanks in advance for any replies.

 For some time now I had a project in mind - website that would teach physics. The issue was that I didn't know anything about web development. So I started reading about html, css and javascript, and I tinkered a little with Phaser.js and created very very simple game with it. I also tried wordpress, ihp and django. I also looked at purescript and halogen as was suggested to me on r/haskell three weeks ago. With none of those I spent more than 2 or 3 days though, so I do not really know much about any of these technologies. I just got my pinky a little wet.
 Anyway, thanks to reading discussions on this subreddit, I decided to settle on …]]></summary>

Dan Allosso has finished a major rewrite on his and S.F. Allosso’s earlier edition of A Short Handbook for writing essays in the Humanities and Social Sciences. This expanded edition has several new chapters on note making (notice that this is dramatically different than note taking) using a zettelkasten-based (or card index or fichier boîte if you prefer) approach similar to that practiced by Beatrice Webb, Marcel Mauss, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Hans Blumenberg, Mortimer J. Adler, and Walter Benjamin among many others.
The focus of the book is on note making for actively producing tangible outputs (essays, papers, theses, monographs, books, etc.). …]]></summary>

 Checking `sbt` version shows "1.7.1" and `scala` version is "3.1.3".
 I tried to test it with basic project but sbt new scala/scala3.g8 (in empty folder) starts from fetching "getting org.scala-sbt sbt 1.3.4" - why? I already have "1.7.1".
 Then it fails due to access denial:
 [error] [launcher] java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException: C:\Users\tom_n\AppData\Local\Coursier\cache\v1\https\repo1.maven.org\maven2\com\swoval\file-tree-views\2.1.3\file-tree-views-2.1.3.jar -> C:\Users\tom_n\.sbt\boot\scala-2.12.10\org.scala-sbt\sbt\1.3.4\file-tree-views-2.1.3.jar
 [error] [launcher] could not retrieve sbt 1.3.4
 PS. I had older version of `scala` and `sbt` installed before but I uninstalled them - could it be that there are some artifacts left?

 which, in my eye, is quite ridiculous. Why are the code made like this? Is this obfuscation required to make haskell as performant? Or is the entire benchmarkgame itself full of these kind of code? If the latter is true, I wonder whether benchmarkgame is credible for anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I write Haskell as a hobby. I am still learning and some concepts are still very hard to understand for me. Since I mostly write Javascript for my day job, I recently got into a very interesting problem. I had to write some logic in where as set of data has to be checked through multiple other datasets and return a value or null at the end.
 When I thought this through in imperative way, I found that I have to write a massive set of if-else logic which might end-up being an "if-else hell" and quite unmanageable to in future. Since I knew I can chain a Maybe monad through multiple function using bind operator in Haskell. I ended up implementing something like this in JS. Here is the Maybe monad implementation 
 class Maybe { __value; constructor(value) { this.__value = value; } static from(value) { return new Maybe(value); } isNothing() { return ( this.__value === null || this.__value === undefined || this.__value === false ); } just() { return this.__value; } do(f) { if (this.isNothing()) { return Maybe.from(null); } return Maybe.from(f(this.__value)); } 
 }
 With the help of this I can do something like this --
 Maybe.from(1) .do(prevValue => prevValue === 1 ? prevValue + 5 : null) //return Maybe 6 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 5 ? prevValue * 2 : null) //return Maybe 12 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 10 ? prevValue + 30 : null) // return Maybe 42 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 100 ? prevValue + 5 : null) // return Maybe null .do(prevValue => prevValue < 100 ? prevValue + 50 : prevValue * prevValue) // will do nothing here .just() // return null since failed on 4th step 
 Is my understanding of Maybe monad implementation correct? How similar it is considered to Haskell's implementation of Maybe monad?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am struggling to specify org-capture-template to insert a template at a current location in the current buffer. This template will be inserted in multiple files, so I cannot specify the file name explicitly.
 This is a plain text template, there is no substitution, or anything else. I just want to insert a heading with a checklist.
 My current definition is (after some Googling)
 ("m" "Miller Heimann checklist" entry (file+function buffer-name (lambda () (goto-char (point)))) (file "~/org/miller-heimann-checklist-template.txt") :immediate-finish t :prepend t :empty-lines 1) 
 This works, sort-off:
  
If point is in the middle of a headline line, a new child node is inserted as expected.
 If the point is on a blank line or on a text line anywhere in the file, a child node is inserted as the first node in the file
  
Before I go off to single-step through the code, has anyone here faced a similar problem?
 I found one post with examples of org-capture tempaltes, but none of them matched what I am looking for. They all had specific file names as targets. 
 It makes me wonder whether I am misusing org-capture-templates. My other option is to create a plain elisp file that will insert text.
 Thanks,

I often type in the left pane which is in the middle of the screen, and use the right pane for docs, messages, help etc. At least I try to. Often I will have Dired in the right pane too.
 With this setup, I often find myself endlessly switching back and forth between those two windows, which I find a bit unnecessary and would like to avoid.
 Emacs has some commands useful for work in other window, like scroll-next-window or open file in other window, but I do miss some. The way I use Emacs, I want to be able to switch buffers back and forth when reading docs and references in other window, as well as kill buffer in other window.

 Did a tech assignment, which I think I did well, but had a tech interview and afterwards they decided they didn't want to continue with me.
 It feels that they were looking for someone with a lot of FP knowledge (which I don't have that much, I understand the concepts, but where I work in currently it's not that much FP), even though that didn't really reflect from the job posting.
 I feel sad, I thought it was a pretty good fit and I put quite some time in the assignment. I prefer to learn on the job as well, that works the best for me
 Do you get rejected too for scala jobs? Any tips on how to move on from this?

I tried tutorial at: tutorial it suggests installing via `cabal install criterion` - that worked fine but I could not run the Fibonacci example (saved as Fibber.hs) via `ghc -O --make Fibber`. The complaint was about non-existent module `Criterion.Main`. I ended up copying `.cabal` file from GitHub and running `cabal build fibber` (which basically build and installe `criterion` once again) and then `cabal run Fibber -- --output fibber.html`.
 So it worked with `cabal` but why did `ghc` fail. What am doing wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[G'day guys,
 As per the title, whop would like me to start making a weekly group study session and post on here for the purpose of learning Haskell. I am studying this wonderful language at Uni (Australian National University) and am really enjoying the content so far.
 I think a resource like this will be really good for the Haskell community.
 The book is made up of 21 Chapters and has many exercises and practice problems for each of them. Each chapter will cover off on a Haskell concept and then build upon that knowledge.
 I have made a Discord for this and this invite link is: https://discord.gg/2u7GBeZe
 There is a poll for those of you who are interested in this.
 The group posts and "classes will start next week". As I am also a "beginner" in the world of Haskell it will be a learning experience for all of us but I am sure that we will have fun. As the book is 21 chapters long, I suspect that this group learning activity will take 21 weeks!
 For those of you who cannot find a copy of this book, the third edition can be easily found on Libgen. Feel free to PM me for a download link to it :)
 ​
 The .hs files for each chapter can be found here: https://www.haskellcraft.com/craft3e/Home.html

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, the topic.
 I have a file with a scala 3 macro that runs through a package object somewhere and outputs a list of all the objects of a certain type. If this file isn't recompiled any time the program changes, this list becomes stale, and that causes problems. I can't figure out how to do this besides literally writing a timestamp to the file in a pre-build task every time so that the file has a modification to it, but there has to be a better way than this, right?
 ​
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am learning Scala after C++ and Rust.
 I was writing a module to parse some made-up binary opcodes into appropriate case classes implementing some common ancestor class: 
 sealed abstract class Instruction object Instruction { case class Add(t: Type, source: Register, destination: Register) extends Instruction ... } 
 I came up with a solution including a list of Int => Function tuples: (2)
 val handlers = List( (OPCODE_NOP, (_,_,_) => Instruction = Instruction.Nop(_, _, _), .. ) 
 The above code is approximate. The original solution was: (3)
  (OPCODE_NOP, Instruction.Nop) 
 But it turns out the second element of the tuple becomes Instruction.Nop.type, instead of a function as I would expect. My question is why is it so and is there a way to shorten the function (2) with placeholders to something similar to the last code block (3) ?
 -----
 Side note: implementors of Instruction have different argument sets, so currently I split them into multiple groups based on argument sets and handle them using LUTs:
 val handlers_type_reg_reg = List( (OP1, OP1_constructor), .. ) val handlers_type_reg = List( (OP2, OP2_constructor), .. ) val handler_types = List( (OP1, handler_type_reg_reg), (OP2, handler_type_reg), ..) 
 So the top-level function would choose a specific function for a group of instructions based on an argument set and call it, the specific function would look up the constructor for the specific instruction and call it.
 Does it look sane or am I missing some beautiful FP / Scala expressiveness?:)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Core Strats at Standard Chartered Bank are hiring Haskell developers again. We're currently looking for three developers, and we're flexible with regards to seniority / experience.
 The head of our group has given a talk at the Haskell Implementer’s Workshop last year where he described the team and what we do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A70SN7vFsKU
 These roles are specifically for Applications & Services development, so expect some GUI work and plenty of stakeholder interaction.
 Applications should go via these links:
 Warsaw: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2200023433 for direct employment, or [CoreStratsRoles@sc.com](mailto:CoreStratsRoles@sc.com) for contracting
 London: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2200023448
 Singapore: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2200017272
 Shanghai: reach out to [CoreStratsRoles@sc.com](mailto:CoreStratsRoles@sc.com)
 The Warsaw position is open to both contractors and direct employment, whereas the others are only open for direct employment. Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll, and after an initial 3-month in-office period. We cover visa and relocation costs for successful employment applicants.
 Note that the first step of the application is a Valued Behaviours Assessment and it is quite important: our team won’t be able to see your application until you pass this assessment. Feel free to contact us at [CoreStratsRoles@sc.com](mailto:CoreStratsRoles@sc.com) if you have any questions about these positions.

I am Carlos and I live in Spain.

So that's it. I hope to learn a lot and actually starting to build my Zettelkasten.

 I'm a little lost here, I've scrolled through all the posts with "thumb" in various forums a good part of them mostly apply to compile time shenanigans (ruled out because I can see images with dired and pressing 'v' or Windows with the image magick support (and I'm on Debian). Thanks.

 So here it comes:
 Whenever I invoke elfeed (M-x elfeed) it opens both a search buffer (*elfeed-search*) and the elfeed.org file I'm using to list my feeds. This means that, once I've exited the elfeed-search buffer, I see the elfeed.org file there. Is there a way to prevent this file from opening in a buffer (preferably) or to close it automagically when the *elfeed-search* buffer is closed?

 I initialized a project nodew/haskell-dapr (github.com) to bring dapr to Haskell world. And I believe it will make Haskell more productive on web development.
 Since Haskell doesn't have good GRPC support today, so currently, I just implemented the HTTP client APIs. 
 You can contribute the project by:
  
Add more tests
 Add Server module
 Create a sample app
 GRPC integration
 Simplify the APIs
  
I'm not good at writing tests in Haskell, especially testing against such a complex system. Your suggestion will be a great help to me and this project, of course, PRs would be much better!

 I had the idea that yearly would be a better option, letting me see all of the headlines for a given year. But there isn't a timestamp for the entries. Each new date gets an entry but no timestamp within the day. Is this by design?
 Okay, so I can just hit a key combo and let emacs put in a timestamp for me. It doesn't work. C-c . just inserts the date, no time. C-u C-c . also just inserts the date, no time.
 Anyone with ideas on how I can have my journal entries timestamped, short of me looking at a clock and entering it by hand?

 I've used r/ObsidianMD for a long time now, but it seems like it would be a pain to replace the Handwriting capability that I have with Obisidian apps on my tablet etc.
 I didn't do digital handwriting for a while, but I want to have it, just in case.
 So do you know of any .el or package to handwrite using Emacs?
 I really like the idea of one personally customized Program for everything, it sucks to have wasted knowledge about specific programs that I change so damn frequently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A struggle that I often have writing prose in Org-mode (or in any text editor with a markup language) is when I need to review things.
 I like to review from a printed copy, I'm better at catching errors that way. I also enjoy the ritual of getting off of my computer, sitting on a desk with printed pages, a red pen, and a cup of coffee.
 For that, I'll export as latex-pdf or odt and print---no big deal. The problem is that when I go back to the computer to make the changes in the file, the positions of the words and sentences are naturally very different from the ones in the printed page. So I have to be constantly switching my view from two texts that are very differently formatted, and that is tiresome. So much so, that I will often make the changes in the odt file on Libreoffice Writer, losing my god-given editing shortcuts, and once they are all done, I'll copy the text and paste it back on my org file. But then I have to be careful with italics and other stuff that will change once I copy the text in the odt and paste it on org. If all I'm doing is writing some informal text, no biggie. But when on an academic writing, messing with footnotes I'd be playing with fire to work in that way. So I end up writing a lot of my academic writer in Writer instead of Emacs.
 The obvious easy solution would be to get used to review from screen, directly in the org file. But that wouldn't help whenever I have other people's review of my text, like advisors and other professors (and a lot of them will require something compatible to MS-Word anyway, for them to use track changes).
 So... any technical solutions of different workflows that I haven't considered? How do you deal with that?

 However, using some tools, I found evidence that stack IS working. (See details below.) It is just being...silent.
 TL;DR:
 So, maybe stack is communicating with some servers, downloading package metadata. (Like Apache Maven downloading .pom files.) It's being silent that makes me worry.
 Are there some CLI options to let stack elaborate on what it i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I open a header or quickly scroll through a newly opened org-file, I can see how the buffer is drawn in a different font-size and color and with all the leading stars shown, and then it is quickly repaired. Why is that? Did I set some hook wrong?
 I managed to capture it in the moment being drawn (see picture). A fracture of a second later, all the headings will look like "Szenen allgemein". But this is redundant, I would prefer Emacs not to have to draw everything twice.
 I have custom-set the faces of the headings a little bit bigger and set them to Source Sans Pro font. The colors come from the theme doom-solarized-light. I use org-superstars to change the looking of the stars, but even if I didn't, why are there two stars drawn at first, with org-hide-leading-stars set to t?
 If I add +pretty to the doom module list, this behaviour is gone (although it should only load org-appear and org-fancy-priorities), but then there is some bug, everything gets extremely slow, taking five seconds to load a 1.3M-file and 1-2 seconds to open a header. I don't need org-appear and org-fancy-priorities, so I prefer the setting without the +pretty module.
 Any ideas why the buffer is drawn twice and how I can omit that?

The powerful type system and other facilities provided by Haskell are believed to provide significant advantages in reducing defects and minimizing debugging. But there's a steep learning curve to get to the point you can take advantage of all of that. Are there any studies or data supporting the notion that benefits are worth the costs? Do we see fewer defects, less time debugging, etc? Just curious.

Now debugging arcane Polysemy messages for hours while getting very little actual work done. I don't know if the proposed benefits will ever actually come (or whether I can get most or all with an easier language) but so far it's really fucking hard. I don't see much in terms of "beginner friendly" documentation, either - almost all the docs is in the form of "example code" (is that the cultural norm in Haskell?), which presumes a fair amount of preexisting Haskell knowledge, depending on what the example actually looks like.
 Rant over.

 - changing how the table is exported
 - displaying special overlays within that table 
 - allowing LaTeX-previews of the proof.
 I know this is a bunch of different features, so I need to start adjusting at a very basic level. What seems to be a good idea is to define a new org-element ndproof which allows for just that. Does anyone of you have any experience in how to approach this, or whether this even makes any sense?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I enabled the variable pitch mode in Org but it doesn't work well for some blocks such as the front matter. I added these rules to assure the front matter displays with a fixed pitch font:
 (set-face-attribute 'org-indent nil :inherit '(org-hide fixed-pitch)) (set-face-attribute 'org-document-title nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'org-document-info nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'org-document-info-keyword nil :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch) 
 The front matter now displays using a fixed pitch font which is what I want but the indentation is still messed up. It looks like so:
 #+title: Document #+author: Author name #+date: [2022-08-27 Sat 12:50] 
 I would like the indentation in the front matter to be fixed as well. The document, author name, and date don't line up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 I have a space leak in a quite simple conduit, where I don't understand why this leaks. See the link for a more detailed wiki page about it with pictures of the heap profiles and the output of eventlog2html.
 Basically, this is the end of a conduit pipeline, which reads from a network socket, parses packets with attoparsec and passes it to this conduit, which assigns a number to the packet, gets some fields (integral values) out of the header of the packet, formats this into a Text value as CSV and writes it to a file handle. 
 See here: https://github.com/oswald2/AURIS/wiki/space_leak
 Can somebody explain to me, why that leaks and how to fix it? I am staring at this now for some hours and feel really stupid...

 I would like to have the interpreter start at the bottom with the file on top.

 I'm looking for a way to remove tags from all but one org heading (and its subs) without affecting things like DEADLINE: 
 I use org in a GTD-like manner and have just simplified my projects list to be:
  
Priority_Projects (org heading); and
 Everything else (awaiting, someday, maybe, incubate, reference). 
  
I'd like to loose all the context tags `:home:garage:phone:` etc from everywhere except my priority heading. I can't see a built-in way to do that. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble getting this function to work right (or properly set the alist). I have Onedrive who's main directory is a symlink and I'd like to keep /Library/CloudStorage urls from being shown throughout Emacs.(macos) The default-dirctory is showing how I want it to.
 ​
 As I understand buffer-file-truename should be using abbrev-file-alist via abbreviate-file-name function to do this.
 I've narrowed my issue down to this function not abbreviating urls.
 ​
 abbrev-file-alist value:
 (("\\`'/Users/username/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive" . "/Users/username/OneDrive"))
 Function:
 (abbreviate-file-name "/Users/username/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive")
 Returns:
 "~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive"
 Function:
 (abbreviate-file-name "~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive")
 Returns:
 "~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive"
 ​
 Does anyone know what may be wrong with my list?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Re-posting from https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-e-graphs-and-equality-saturation-hegg-0-1/4974 (more discussion there)
 I’m happy to announce the first release of the library hegg-0.1 on hackage: hegg: Fast equality saturation in Haskell 12 !
 hegg
 stands for haskell e-graphs good, and it’s a library featuring e-graphs (a data structure that efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions) and a high level API for equality saturation (an optimization/term-rewriting technique)
 It is a pure haskell implementation found on two recent awesome papers: egg: Fast and Extensible Equality Saturation 3 (2020) and Relational E-matching 2 (2021).
 I’d love to see what you might come up with leveraging e-graphs and equality saturation (there’s a world of applications – check out the papers and other resources), so do let me know about your efforts and how the library could be improved.
 I’ve spent a long while optimizing and making the e-graphs and equality saturation considerably performant. So we are already pretty fast! (according to my symbolic rewriting tests). I’d love to see more involved use cases, because I still see many opportunities for improving performance, and would love to take them when justified by bigger numbers and applications!
 I’ll be happy to clarify anything,
 Thank you,
 Rodrigo

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read a lot of tutorials for monads and applicative functors but for some reason it's just not clicking. I understand specific use cases, but I'm having trouble gaining a general intuition of what monads and applicative functors do. For example Typeclassopedia says "the structure of a Applicative computation is fixed, whereas the structure of a Monad computation can change based on intermediate results". By "structure of computation", do they mean that it behaves similar to an if-else statement? Like if b from (a -> m b) is 5, then do x, otherwise do y.
 What I took away from Graham Hutton's video on applicative functors was that they basically are an extension of fmap but for multiple arguments. This made sense, until I thought about the List applicative. pure (+) <*> [1, 2, 3] <*> [1, 2, 3] equals [2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6], which makes the "multiple arguments" angle confusing. I know that applicative functors can "embedded" functions into context, and that's why the result of the List applicative was so, because of how it models nondeterminism. But idk it just hasn't "clicked" for me yet.
 I was wondering someone could explain the intuition behind monads and applicative functors. Thank you in advanced!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is an Applicative instance for all the polynomial functors except Sum. Not because no instance is possible but because too many instances are possible. When lifting over different constructors we need to choose how to map one to the other, and which to map.
 Abstracting with Applicatives gives the approach of using an applicative morphism, something that preserves the applicative operations (here idiom) to mediate between between InL and InR. This is the approach used by my idiomatic package.
 instance Natural f g => Applicative (Sum f g) where pure :: a -> Sum f g a pure x = InL (pure x) liftA2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> (Sum f g a -> Sum f g b -> Sum f g c) liftA2 (·) (InL as) (InL bs) = InL do liftA2 (·) as bs liftA2 (·) (InR as) (InR bs) = InR do liftA2 (·) as bs -- these are interesting liftA2 (·) (InL as) (InR bs) = InR do liftA2 (·) (idiom as) bs liftA2 (·) (InR as) (InL bs) = InR do liftA2 (·) as (idiom bs) -- Applicative morphism type Idiom :: (Type -> Type) -> (Type -> Type) -> Constraint class (Applicative f, Applicative g) => Idiom f g where idiom :: f ~> g 
  
Can all Applicative sum types be deconstructed in this way
 Specifically can the Free f Monad
 What would you call this approach and does it appear in the literature

 use helm-imenu to navigate file contents. I see all functions, classes + their internals. I can navigate to function's internals (like var or inner function), BUT can't navigate to the function itself?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am trying literate programming and in my attempts to reference a source code block A from source code block B I get the following behavior which is not what i need.
 Is my approach wrong or am I missing something?
 org-version: 9.5.2; emacs-version: 28.1; distribution: spacemacs
 #+name: A #+begin_src js () => { console.log('hello world') } #+end_src #+name: B #+begin_src js :noweb yes let fn = <<A>> #+end_src should the outcome of the expansion be? let fn = () => { console.log('hello world') } Instead I get: let fn = () => { let fn = console.log('hello world') let fn = } 
 I found this article in stack overflow which is very similar if not the same problem I am having; but does not help since it attributes the problem to an old org-mode version.
 Cheers,
 pnoul
