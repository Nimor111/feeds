        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am annoyed that when I C-g out of my expand-region session my cursor does not return to its original location.
 In trying to resolve this annoyance I found that expand-region comes with a variable er/save-mode-excursion that is described as:
  
A function to save excursion state while expanding
  
I set this variable to (lambda (&rest body) () (save-excursion body)) and I found that this does not suit my needs for the following reasons.
  
This variable does not seem to effect any er/ commands outside of er/expand-region. For example if I do er/mark-defun and then hit C-g my cursor position is not returned.
 I often use a key-chord bound to (lambda () (interactive) (execute-kbd-macro (read-kbd-macro "\C-g"))). When I use this key-chord instead of actually hitting C-g my cursor position is not returned. I do not understand why this is.
  
Next I tried taking advantage of the deactivate-mark-hook to programatically hit C-u C-SPC.
 (add-hook 'deactivate-mark-hook #'(lambda () (let ((current-prefix-arg 4)) (call-interactively 'set-mark-command)))) 
 This works great for my non expand-region region endeavours but when I try to use any er/ commands I get unpredictable behavior. I believe the problem is that expand-region resets the mark multiple times and therefore deactivate-mark-hook is called multiple times.
 My next idea is to make my own expand-region-minor-mode where I can probably solve this problem. Before I do this though I want to know if there are already existing solutions.

 One warped Haskell, the theoretically sound and purely functional language, into essentially assembly code. The other (and I'm more fuzzy on this) programmed using only c headers, or something equally absurd that is not intended to write real programs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[See: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences.
 With chrisdone we just added DList & Acc & snoc benchmarks into comparison.
 I think it is useful for everyone to see "if old folk DList recommendation to solve [] problems actually holds water".
 Because there is a direct comparison with numbers now.
 To be sure I additionally checked with spl (DList author) in: https://github.com/spl/dlist/issues/102 & chrisdone of course holds the benchmarking repository.
  
Where is no benchmarks for data types - it implies the library/data type authors consider operation counterproductive to structure & so those operations made not idiomatic (like for simple snocing the [] one needs to list <> [el] - [] does not provide snocing operation for reason of it being counterproductive) - it means the operation to be composite/requires conversion into other data type & so not showable in the benchmark
  
Would note that DList is not designed for strictness.
 DList data design relies on the leverage of Haskell laziness & function composition, please use DList as it is by default.
  
An update:
 Acc claim still checks-out under conditions for purpose of the data type. For example - DList is created to be consumed partially & in a lazy fashion, while Acc is created to be a builder type that goes into full normalization to be converted into a storage type (like Vector or Seq). So every type has its own domain of application & haskell-perf/sequences currently has not enough benchmarks to show all particularities of types under different conditions of use.
 As I opened: 1. Please, make a traverse test: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/24 2. Please, add to/fromList conversion tests: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/26 3. Please, add a NFData normalization benchmark: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/27

 I am trying to use {-# LANGUAGE LinearTypes #-} to make one of my user-facing APIs safer. However, I find myself in a situation where I am relying on a third-party function that has no linear type. Is there some escape hatch that lets me take my argument in a a %1 -> b and give it to a function a -> b?
 I tried to google this and found some references that said there were no such hatch, but they were quite old so perhaps things changed since then. If I can not do this I am afraid I won't be able to use LT for a while. I just want to use LT to make my API safer, not my implementation.

 When I am in a TRAMP buffer I cannot launch vterm. I do not want a vterminal in the remote location of the buffer, but only a simple vterm in my home directory. (I would like to also have a vterm in the remote directory, but it doesn't work; anyways, this is for another post).
 I tried this simple function, but didn't work either.
 (defun run-my-vterm () (interactive) (let* ((buffer "vterm")) (require 'vterm) (if (buffer-live-p (get-buffer buffer)) (switch-to-buffer buffer) (vterm)) (vterm-send-string (concat "cd " "~")) (vterm-send-return))) 
 It seems like vterm tries to open the terminal in the remote location but doesn't succeed. 
 A workaround I use is to jump to scratch buffer and launch vterm from there, or use ansi-term.

 This is my first Reddit post, so be gentle 😊

 I want try using Telegra (Telegram client in Emacs). So Ive been following this link. https://ritschmaster.github.io/2021/06/13/Using-telga-in-Windows-10.html .

I need the MSYS2 version of Emacs, so that Telega will work (it only works out-of-the-box with any Emacs with Linux and Mac).

 Now having installed, my limited knowledge made me confused as to why Emacs opens up as Spacemacs (I thought it would create its own Emacs?). But doesnt matter, coz if I can make Telega work, then there is no need to use 2 separate Emacs, and I wil…]]></summary>

 Indeed, the mistake is that in maybeInsert I am trying to pattern match on a previously bound variable i. But the compiler no longer recognises i as bound, and it compiles fine... but the code doesn't behave as intended. Should the compiler allow this in a where block? I would suggest it should at least include a warning. I imagine many of us have made this mistake at some point...
 For reference, my intended behaviour is achieved by

        <updated>2021-11-21T23:35:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working over the last week to read and process for my ZK a particular book.  It contains about 40 short articles by different authors with "inspirational" messages and discussions of life experiences.  I created a zettel for each article (these were fairly short, mostly one- or two-idea articles).  After a while, I created a structure note for the book, grouping and linking to each zettel/article.
So far, so good - normal use of a structure note.  The little "aha" moment came as follows...
At the end of each zettel, (because the zettel contained an inspirational idea), I added a "What will I do?" question.  I didn't want to just capture the idea, I wanted to see if I could incorporate it into my life in some useful manner.  The "aha" thought was to copy that question and its short answer from each zettel and paste that after the reference to the corresponding zettel on the structure note.  That way, I can simply scan down the structure note occasionally to remind myself of what I wanted to do, check my progress, pick out one item on which to focus for a few days, etc.
So the structure note became a way of reviewing my follow-up actions.  This is a simple addition that I've made to one structure note, and perhaps in retrospect, it is so evident as to be painfully obvious.  But it both simplifies and enhances the way that I interact with my ZK.  I have previously written zettels about various philosophies (regarding ethical behaviour) and have a few structure notes related to those.  If time permits, I may give them the same treatment.
As an aside, I did ask a question about this process before (of acting on ideas we bring into our ZK), which received a few interesting comments.  You can find the previous post here:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently discovered an awesome capability of Emacs, where I can use occur to pull all matching lines into a split window and press e to enter occur-edit-mode. In this mode I can do things like replace-string to modify all of the matching lines in my original buffer.
 This only modifies the occurrences, and is fantastic! The best part is that I can see all of the potential changes to the original buffer in a concise, noise-free area.
 Shortcoming
 This mode does not currently have evil bindings. I can test my regex by using evil-ex - I get my lovely red strike-through and expected changes, but entering evil-ex seems to disable the edit capabilities of the occur-edit-mode and I'm left with a read-only buffer.
 Current Workflow
 I'm modifying 20+ large files with many rewrite rules and have come up with the following:
  
Use eshell to create a grep buffer across all relevant files.
 Test my regex using : (evil-ex) in the grep buffer
 Verify that all buffers will change as desired.
 Jump to each matching file from the grep buffer one-at-a-time
 Apply my regex to the original buffer, scanning for errors
 Save file and repeat for next file in the existing grep buffer.
  
This is not perfect because the regex applies to the original buffer as a whole, not only the matching lines, but so far it's a huge time saver!
 Does anyone have a better workflow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example
 import GHC.Stack x :: HasCallStack => Int x = (srcLocStartLine . snd . last . getCallStack) callStack main = do print x print x print x 
 results in
 7 8 9 
 and after rewriting with a rewrite rule we take for granted:
 import GHC.Stack x :: HasCallStack => Int x = (srcLocStartLine . snd . last . getCallStack) callStack main = do let y = x print y print y print y 
 outputs
 7 7 7 
 That is to say, referential transparency is violated. There's an easy fix: change the type of callStack from
 callStack :: HasCallStack => CallStack 
 to
 callStack :: HasCallStack => IO CallStack 
 Observing call stacks in IO is perfectly reasonable. (So technically it's not HasCallStack that breaks referential transparency, but callStack.)
 But I can't be the first person to make this objection. It must have been made before the proposal to add HasCallStack was accepted. What was the explanation for dismissing it? I can't find the proposal in the ghc-proposals repo. Perhaps the functionality predates that repo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Zotero as reference manager. I use my Zettelkasten for maintaining references that are actually in use but Zotero holds lots of unused and unmaintained references (i.e. not in my ZK), especially webpages that i store offline just in case the source is changed or unavailable.
In Zotero it is easy to find duplicates which is the only maintenance i do. Zotero allows creating folders, tags to help with search but i find maintaining two separate systems is too much effort. I also don't worry much about unused references because i don't see them as backlog, they're just collecting dust. But i know there is good stuff in it and occasionally i'd simply like to dig into it and add something interesting to my Zettelkasten.
I think what would be most helpful to me is a list of unused references sorted by creation date or in general allow communication between both systems for maintenance purpose only.
In previous discussions others mentioned that they use "The Internet Archive" to store webpages or don't store webpages in their RMS at all and instead paste the URL to the note1. Some are maintaining a reading list.
Any thoughts on maintenance?

I just started looking at concur and it seems pretty complicated. I'm thinking making a full scale project is going to be alot of work compared to JS since I want to add tailwind and markdown+mermaid among other stuff. Would it be painful to add non purescript libraries to work with purescript?
 The other option I'm looking at is using Sanctuary + vue, but I love the ADT system in Purescript so much for defining my domain model that I don't want to lose it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been playing with some text processing in Haskell, and I would like to import a text file `"AliceInWonderland.txt"` and see how my functions perform. However, when I try to read the file `alice = readFile "AliceInWonderland.txt"` I naturally encounter the obstacle that `alice` is not a `String` but rather an `IO String` on which I cannot readily apply my `functions :: String -> Whatever`, nor can I `show` their result if I lift their return value to IO (`liftedFun x = return $ functions x` can then be composed as `alice >>= liftedFun`). Aside: Is there a better way to lift a function than `liftedFun x = return $ functions x`?
 Is there a good way around this? I would like to just import the text and keep playing and testing my code, preferably without having to play laborious for every step.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The documents mode are a tree based data structure. A graph based data structure is more powerful to express task dependency. Even we use some plugin like org-edna/org-depend to express a dependant task of a headline h1 who isn't a descendant of h1, all functions on subtask can run only for descendant of a headline.
 For instance, what will happen if 2 projects p1 and p2 depend a same task t1. t1 is a descendant of p1. And we want know the progress of p2, the progress of t1 won't be integrated to calculation of progress of p2.
 To solve this problem, org mode should integrate the notion of symbolic link headline, like in tree based file system, we have file and symlink into a file. I don't think org mode will evolve into this direction, because it is designed to write documents. A document don't need this feature.
 What do you think about this limit of org mode to become the ideal task management? How you bypass the problem?
 I think to switch into a graph based task management system. Someone know a good open source graph based task management system? If possible like emacs, is fully customizable.

 ghci > scanl ( flip (:)) [] [3 ,2 ,1] [[] ,[3] ,[2 ,3] ,[1 ,2 ,3]] 
 scanl is like foldl, so isn't the first call to the lambda have 2 parameters [] and 3?
 The accumulator and x like:
 (/acc x -> x : acc) --so why is it giving [] as the first element of result? 
 The [] is an intermediate accumulator in the case of scanl? So it's like foldl but slightly different?
 This definition on Hoogle for foldl:
 foldl :: Foldable t => (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b
 vs what I imagined it to be but is wrong:
 fold::(b->a->b) -> b -> [a] -> b 
 t a means "the current value of some List of type a"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Emacs 27.2 with emacs -q, calling calc-edit (bound to the ` key by default) with an element on the calc stack will bring up the *Calc Edit* buffer in place of the original calc buffer. When you're done editing the element, you can do C-c C-c to dismiss the *Calc Edit* buffer and the original calc buffer will now have your edited element on the stack.
 However, on a version of Emacs I built off the emacs-28 branch about a week ago, also with emacs -q, calling calc-edit will instead bring up the *Calc Edit* buffer in a separate window, while the original calc buffer is still visible. Then, after editing the element and doing C-c C-c, the window layout becomes messed up: the original calc buffer remains at the bottom, but now there's another calc buffer and *Calc Trail* buffer in the place of where the *Calc Edit* buffer was. I attached an image to show what this layout looks like.
 Since this happens with emacs -q, it seems like it could be a bug, but searching around online doesn't show anyone else bringing it up, so maybe it's either a recent bug, or could it just be me? Can anyone confirm this behavior?
 This is all on macOS, by the way.

Namely, I have "SPC w" mapped to evil-window-map (so I can do "SPC w s" to open a window below or "SPC w l" to move focus right). However, when I evaluate (key-binding (kbd "SPC w")), it returns (keymap evil-window-map evil-window-map) - that is, "SPC w" is bound to a keymap whose elements are two copies of the evil-window-map keymap. This doesn't affect my workflow at all, but it's pretty unexpected, and I thought I'd check on here to make sure I wasn't missing something dumb.
 The minimal config I could reproduce it with is:
 (use-package general :config (general-create-definer leader-def :states '(normal visual motion) :prefix "SPC")) (use-package evil :config (evil-mode)) (leader-def "" nil ;;to prevent an error about SPC not being a prefix "w" 'evil-window-map)

 I'm fiddling around with using transient for building a menu over a CLI. I wanted some insight into typical transient usage. My main use of transient currently is magit. 
 I want to build a transient menu which lets me choose from an arbitrary number of options. I will only know the number of options at run time. How do I paginate this with transient? 
 ​
 for example, show only the first 4 elements and map those to `a s d f` and when the user presses `g` show the next 4 elements. Or is there a better way of using transient menus with arbitrary lists of options?

 This may be an inappropriate question for this subreddit, if so let me know and I will take it down right away, but this is a community who's opinions on this matter I respect.
 I love math and computer science and their intersection, and I have a career choice conundrum. Here is what I want: my dream is to work towards a garageband hedgefund. I love the math and programming challenges in finance, I love the control you get over the direction you take, I love the immediate and direct feedback on your work, I love the excitement and the power and the challenge, I love the data accumulation and processing infrastructure you can create, I love the high and low level thinking involved. I want to be able to whole heartedly work towards a career in this field.
 Here is another set of desires: I also want to contribute to society. I want to work towards making peoples lives better. I want to deepen as a person and work towards being a human of heart.
 These two ideas seem to be in direct conflict and have left me floundering directionless during my Masters degree in software and math. I would really appreciate thoughts from this community which seems to straddle a line between math, programming, and passion.

For example, one of the most obvious things to do after breaking down and linking up the project is to display it as a network diagram - a graph on which each task is a node, and nodes are linked to those they depend on. This lets you get a high level view of the project, in a way in which manually inspecting :PROPERTY: drawers and decoding org-ids doesn't.
 I've done some hacks to create such visualizations in the past, see e.g. this bit of bad elisp that scraps :BLOCKER: entries for trivial ID-based links, builds a graph description and shoves it to Graphviz for rendering. I'm thinking about continuing developmen…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've released on ELPA the new package kind-icon, which adds simple, lightweight text or monochrome icons to the prefix margin of compatible completion UI's, matching by default the font-lock colors of variables/functions/keywords/etc. Many backends like lsp-mode support the :company-kind completion property, which is how kind-icon determines the kind. Since text and icons all take up the space of precisely 3 characters, alignment is always pixel perfect.
 kind-icon is easy to set up, and works either as a "margin-formatter" function (for supporting UI's such as the excellent [corfu] completion front-end), or by wrapping the completion function, for other completion UI's which can handle the Emacs 28+ affixation-function completion property.
 An example of kind-icon in action with corfu:
 kind-icon with corfu and orderless, in lsp-mode
 And with more than 6500 icons instantly configurable by name, you can easily make it your own...

Notice how we pattern matched on (x :-: xs) . That works because pattern matching is actually about matching constructors. We can match on :-: because it is a constructor for our own list type and we can also match on : because it is a constructor for the built-in list type. Same goes for []. Because pattern matching works (only) on constructors, we can match for stuff like that, normal prefix constructors or stuff like 8 or 'a', which are basically constructors for the numeric and character types, respectively.
  
Here the code comes from hs infixr 5 :-: data List a = Empty | a :-: (List a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord) 
 Can you please elaborate this section please.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, we were trying to figure out an ideal way to represent Semver. There are a few ways we've tried representing semver however each has its drawbacks. Here are the 3 possible implementations we've considered each of them have drawbacks:
  
Simple data type data Version Natural Natural Natural
 
Sum type data Version = Major0Minor1Patch0 | Major0Minor2Patch0 | Major1Minor0Patch0 | Major1Minor1Patch0
 
Use a sum type on each major minor patch version. This is the approach we are currently taking: ```haskell data Patch = Patch0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)
 
 data Minor = Minor0 | Minor1 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)
 data Major = Major0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)
 data Version = Version { major :: Major , minor :: Minor , patch :: Patch } deriving (Generic, Eq, Show) ```
 Requirements:
 Serialization/deserialization via aeson
 Complicated pattern matching
 This is important with event sourcing as some consumers may not care about minor version changes only major version changes.
 If we have a new major version and we don't handle it then we want to fail to compile.
 1: Wouldn't give us strong compile-time guarantees. I don't know all actual versions we have.
 2: Forces us to handle all versions even if the consumer does not care. I don't have a way to say I only care about Major versions.
 3: Lets us handle only major version changes, and we know all possible major versions. However, we are representing a product and can introduce versions that don't really exist. e.g. if we have 0.1.0, 1.0.0, 1.1.0 then if we create a 1.2.0 we are now also representing 0.2.0.
 I'm curious if anyone has an alternative representation that might be better. Thanks!

 ok so I've been using vim for a bit and mainly I was just learning programming so it was no problem, but lately I feel like I need a better development environment.
 So I've read a thing or two about emacs and emacs is I think exactly what I need. 
 Problem: I spent a lot of time to customize vim. lots of scripts, functions, mappings so now I really dont feel like switching to something else but I dont have a choice. I tried watching some videos on youtube like emacs introduction something like that, but they dont seem very helpful
 So: if you can give me some documentation or any kinda resource i can read or watch whatever so i can pick up emacs and start writing asap, the more in depth stuff I'll learn as I use emacs thruout. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taking inspiration from Doom, I'm using a "local leader" setup to bind mode-relevant commands, like:
 (general-create-definer local-leader-def :states '(normal visual motion) :prefix "SPC m") 
 This way, I can do stuff like (local-leader-def :keymaps 'ledger-mode-map "r" 'ledger-report), making it super easy to access the report when I'm in ledger mode with a quick SPC m r. However, this approach starts to break down in more complicated scenarios, such as:
 (local-leader-def :keymaps 'org-mode-map "a" '(:ignore t :wk "attachments") "a a" 'org-attach "a d" '(:ignore t :wk "deletion") "a d d" 'org-attach-delete-one "a d G" 'org-attach-delete-all "r" '(:ignore t :wk "refile") "r r" 'org-refile) 
 First, this is kind of ugly - Org has a ton of features, and I try to use a lot of them, so some of my key sequences can get pretty long. I end up retyping the same prefix many, many times, sometimes with multiple layers of the (:ignore t :wk "foo") trick (as seen above).
 Second, (and more annoyingly, IMO) doing it this way "shadows" the which-key description for modes which share a prefix. That is, if I'm in ledger mode and type "SPC m", it yields the suggestion "r -> refile" instead of "r -> ledger-report" as it should.
 I've been futzing around with general's ":prefix-command" and related facilities to try and figure out a way of avoiding this second issue, but so far I haven't been able to get anything to work. Since my current strategy is ad hoc and not based on any best practices I'm aware of, I thought I'd ask here if there's a canonical/idiomatic way of using general's capabilities to define groups of similarly-prefixed commands without breaking which-key.
 (Also, why is there a distinction between :prefix-command and :prefix-map? When do you need to store a keymap as the value of a function instead of as variable or vice versa?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I've been diving into learning some emacs over the last week or so as I'm interested in possibly switching over from using neovim (primarily because I want org-mode). I've been deep diving into a lot of new things and trying to set up alternatives for my major nvim workflows, but one that I've been having a ton of trouble with is searching and the previews for it in particular. In my projects I make heavy use of Telescope within neovim and one of the major reasons that I love it is the ability to preview grep results from files in my project directory within a separate window. I like being able to get more context from the search without actually opening up a new buffer. I've set up Ivy and Counsel and was trying to get the same functionality working, but I'm having a heck of a time with previewing. The closest I've come is realizing that after using counsel-projectile-rg that I can use ivy-next-line-and-call functionality to move the current buffer through the search results with C-M n or C-M p, however, that actually opens the buffer and populates my buffer list. Does anyone know if there's some sort of functionality to open a new preview window and navigate through those search results in it by default with C-j (I'm using evil mode). Essentially I'd always like this type of preview whenever I'm doing searches. Also, I'm not attached to any particular completion or search framework, so if this is easier in something like Helm then I'd be open to solutions from that as well. I attached a gif of what I'm talking about working in Telescope

 What's next?
 In the next couple of months I'll be working with maintainers of downstream packages to identify migration opportunities. The plan is to patch entire head.hackage (which includes, for instance, pandoc) before cutting a final release of text-2.0.
 Thanks to Ben Gamari's efforts, text submodule in GHC source tree has been already bumped to 2.0-rc1. The next major release of GHC (9.4, ~Q3 2022) will ship with text-2.0.

 I have been following DT, System Crafters, etc. I even went to a very basic ~/.emecs.d/init.el file with 5 commands to setup Org and org-agenda with the requisite org-agenda-files list pointing to one org file with 2 TODOs.
 I have tried this on a ThinkPad Ext Gen 4 running Ubuntu 21.10 and a ThinkPad w520 running Ubuntu 21.04. But, I keep getting the same error. I am running Emacs 27.1 on both. But, I tried 27.2 earlier with same results.
 Is anyone else having issues? I was only able to find one helpful mailing post regarding a change to the Org installation doc as follows: "Important: You need to do this in a session where no '.org' file has been visited ..." - not sure what I should do with this.
 My next attempt will be to reinstall Ubuntu and then install on another distro. I suppose, I could also try pre-27 emacs versions, but I like the 27 upgrades.
 Anyone have any idea what could cause this (before I reinstall)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A tree model isn't the ideal model to represent the tasks.
 If few projects depend a same task, we can't express it with tree model without redundancy. A graph model is better.
 It seems org-edna allow express the graph dependency of task (I never have use it).
 But org-edna miss some operation on graph, for instance visualize dependency graph of tasks.
 In https://karl-voit.at/2020/08/14/project-mgt-draft/, the author use plantUML to visualize dependency graph of tasks. But he doesn't haven say how he generates the code of plantUML from org headline.
 I think maybe org-roam could be a better approach to interact with the dependency graph of tasks.
 Does it is possible to integrate org-roam to org-edna to interact with the dependency graph of tasks?

 Why it is showing me this error
 ~~~ No instance for (Show a) arising from a use of ‘show’ Possible fix: add (Show a) to the context of the type signature for: tellCar' :: forall a. Car' String String a -> String ~~~ Where i have written deriving(Show) in the defination of Car'

 Here's the description:
  
em-compile tries to determine what commands it should defer to a 
 compilation buffer, and alerts you when it's done. It determines 
 which commands it should defer by keeping track of how long each 
 command took to finish. By default if it takes more than 5 seconds 
 then it will start to defer that command whenever it's invoke via 
 eshell. You can of course customize the amount of seconds or offer 
 a list of always defer or not defer.
  
Link: https://github.com/gopar/.emacs.d/tree/main/lisp/eshell/module
 I have no interest in making this into a package (i was at one point but not anymore), so if you want to turn it into something. Go for it :)
 Have you created anything that you've been hiding? :)
 Also, plz ignore the messy config files. Too lazy to clean up.

 Some of my notes will be changed from time to time. Information will be replaced (e.g. I'm regularly borrowing a book to people and the note remembers to whom I lend the book currently).
 The deleted information is not of much use, but sometimes it could be necessary to recover it (e.g. after a while the book got tatty, so I'd like to know its history of borrowers).
 (Note: the above book example is just an example to explain a concept)
 Would it be practical to create a git repository out of my org-roam notes folder, or are there unwanted side effects with that approach (i.e. inconsistent database, confused org-roam, ...)?
 Edit: thanks for all the positive feedback, that keeping org-roam notes in a git repository is possible and works.

 I'd like to add a face definition to whitespace-mode's customize group faces, so that I can pick that color, but I can't figure out how to do it. Could anyone give me any pointers?
 Specifically, I'd like to pick this one from org-mode:
 (defface org-hide '((((background light)) (:foreground "white")) (((background dark)) (:foreground "black"))) "Face used to hide leading stars in headlines. The foreground color of this face should be equal to the background color of the frame." :group 'org-faces) 
 But I don't know how I'd do that. I also don't know what the background function does here or how this works. All I know is that this makes characters invisible unless you highlight them or otherwise change the background color, which is what I want.
 The name of the face doesn't matter as long as it does what the above face does.
 Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So as I understand, something like this
 data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a) 
 is considered a sum type because it is a sort of set theory "sum" or "disjoint union" of the two constructors. A disjoint union, as I understand, is just when you have a union of sets that have nothing shared; you "summed" the sets. So we imagine our List above a sort of disjoint union of Nil and Cons a (List a). Correct? What gets confusing is from a Wikipedia article on Algebraic data types :
  
In set theory the equivalent of a sum type is a disjoint union, a set whose elements are pairs consisting of a tag (equivalent to a constructor) and an object of a type corresponding to the tag (equivalent to the constructor arguments).
  
The disjoint union article was fairly understandable, but I'm not making the connection between my List above and this quote above about tags and constructors and constructor arguments. Nice if someone could shine some light on this for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently using General for leader-key bindings, and I have various categories of keybindings under different prefix keys like "f" for files, "b" for buffers, etc. I use SPC as my leader key, so to access my file related commands I would press "SPC f", where I would be presented with a list (via which-key) of my file related keybindings.
 Ok I'm sure many of you are with me so far. Here is my question: I'd like to create keybindings for language-specific commands, but I don't want to create a separate prefix key for each language. What's the best way to manage that?
 One idea I've thought of is to use "l" (for "language") as a prefix key for whatever language mode I'm in. So if I'm programming in Scheme, and I press "SPC l" it would bring up my scheme keybindings. But if I was in javascript, and I press "SPC l" it would bring up my javascript bindings.
 However I'm not sure how to implement that. I'm a bit of a emacs noob to be honest.
 Is there some other recommended way to deal with this? I'm open to other ways of organizing.
 Another idea I thought of is to create another level of prefix keys under "l" where each key would bring up the keybindings for a given language. So maybe "SPC l j" would bring up the javascript menu, and "SPC l s" would bring up the scheme menu. This is something I probably could do without too much trouble, but I prefer the first approach.
 Any help appreciated, thanks!

 It works, but it is very basic currently. My problem with it is that I wind up with a lot of Async Shell Command buffers. I'd like to have no buffers created from the function. Is there something besides aysnc-shell-command that I can use?
 ​
 I also have to answer y/n to 
 A command is running in the default buffer. Use a new buffer? (y or n) 
 when cader/kill-lofi is called. How do I just make it exit without additional input?

 22.4 Creating Keymaps make-keymap &optional prompt [Function] ... A full keymap is more efficient than a sparse keymap when it holds lots of bindings; for just a few, the sparse keymap is better." 
 From reading about this in the manual I have 2 question:
  
Why is a full keymap more efficient than a sparse keymap? Is it just because of the overhead of accessing an element in an alist vs a char table?
 Is there a definitive way to determine when to use a sparse-keymap vs a full keymap?

 I'm attempting to finish up a package that uses comint to wrap around an external REPL.
 The program itself has tab-completion already, but obviously running it in a comint buffer doesn't allow for the tab-completion. In the REPL, pressing TAB on say some-module.s will bring up all the available functions that match and pressing TAB again will cycle through them.
 How does one go about having this functionality in a comint buffer? Or is it better to make use of term or vterm?

 I have found this guide: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IBusMode
 But the problems is that it does not work anymore.
 I have tried the set-input-method for japanese but it does not work well with converting hiragana to kanji.
 I would like to use ibus-anthy since all of programs already use that.
 So far I have set this in my /etc/environment:
  
export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
 export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
 export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
  
I have tinkered with the .Xresources file as well but none of the options did work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm experimenting with literate coding. In the process I couldn't properly evaluate a block. I wanted to use both:results output and :export both, and I'm getting troubles to make those work with :defines. This is the code I have: 
 #+property: header-args :includes <stdio.h> #+property: header-args :defines cool_macro(x) x #+property: header-args :exports both #+property: header-args :results output #+begin_src C printf("cool_macro(7): %u\n", cool_macro(7)); printf("cool_macro(7): %u\n", cool_macro(7)); #+end_src 
 As it is, both :exports and :results have no effect. I figured that if I place them above the :includes then they'll have effect, but I get a compilation error because it cannot find the macro, as if now both :includes and :defines doesn't have effect.
 If I place those 2 after the #+begin_src C then everything works as expected, but it's inconvenient since I want those to affect the whole buffer..
 #+property: header-args :includes <stdio.h> #+property: header-args :defines cool_macro(x) x #+begin_src C :results output :exports both printf("cool_macro(7): %u\n", cool_macro(7)); printf("cool_macro(7): %u\n", cool_macro(7)); #+end_src 
 Am I doing something really wrong or what?
 Thanks.

 Hello r/emacs
 Recently I was facing an issue with my org roam config. Specifically, I wanted to share my notes on a subject with a friend and I realized how annoying it is to select every note that points to an index and copy it to a folder which I can share with someone. The easiest solution I could find was to open the org-roam-dedicated-buffer of the index and slowly mark every file there in dired and finally copy them to a location. But that is really slow to do.
 So, since this is emacs, I decided that if a feature doesn't exist, you just create it yourself. Today I found the time to work on this and got a working result. Not…]]></summary>

I would like to be able to see where this link points without clicking on it. Right now the only work-around I've found is to open the email as HTML in my browser, and THERE hover over the link to see where it points. There must be a better way, but neither web searches nor customization searches have helped me here. How can I see the target of a link from [Gnus] article mode viewing HTML emails?

If anyone wants to show off their awesome configs, I would highly appreciate it. Also, I know for the most part we want to place things that are not GUI related, but do we have to provide the file? Or does emacs find it on its own in the ~/.emacs.d directory? Anyways, Tips are greatly appreciated for a newbie like me!

 lazy val a = (project in file("a"))
 lazy val b = (project in file("b")).dependsOn(a)
 lazy val c = (project in file("c")).dependsOn(b)
 ...
 and so on (actually 11 of them)
 each of them has its own version.sbt file, like that:
 version := "2.3-SNAPSHOT"
 question:
 is there a way / plugin / sample configuration that will trigger the build from the certain project in the middle, let's say, project c
 and rebuild everything from c to the end of the chain, incrementing the major/minor version depends on some command / setting. 
 I use sbt-release plugin, it works well for any other project which has only one version.sbt for all subprojects in the repo
 but here I need to maintain a different version for each subproject
 Actually, this isn't rocket science, but probably this thing is already created.
 Thanks in advance

 For example, the way I have configured i3 right now is so that Windows key + F will bring up a firefox window. So, I can press Windows + F where-ever and a new firefox window spawns. I want to do the same with emacs, but with new frames rather than emacs instances. (Frames are faster to create, and I have some idle timers that sync directories which would be unnecessarily duplicated when more than one emacs instance is spawned.)
 Is this possible? For reference, my firefox configuration in i3 is simply bindsym $mod+f exec firefox. Is there for example a exec emacs --create-frame-from-existing-instance?

I was thinking of adding a character at the end of the tags. For example, ;, , or .. But, I'd have to change the tags manually since the Tag Wrangler plugin won't let me add those characters. And that can take some time.
I could use Obsidian's tag: search operator. Instead of searching for #idea, I type tag:idea and get what I want. I'd prefer to stay software-independent, so no thank you.
I couldn't find anything on this around here or in the Obsidian forum.
So, I would like to ask how you guys go about this. Mind sharing?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the POC code to generate a table report, I put it as an org-mode dynamic block to help me deal with the table data management.
 https://gist.github.com/Trevoke/c91cc8c97476f681f82f9ce44efdac9b
 ​
 e.g. do this:
 #+begin: clockreport-by-project #+end: 
 and hit C-c C-c on the begin line.
 It generates this:
 ​
 #+begin: clockreport-by-project | | 2021-11-15.org | 2021-11-16.org | |------------+----------------+----------------| | EA | 0.18 | | | internal | 0.83 | | | management | 0.47 | 1.70 | #+end: 
 ​
 It makes two big assumptions:
 * you use a PROJECT property on things you clock
 * you are using files named after the day of the year (e.g. `2021-11-16` but really whatever makes sense for you)
 ​
 * right now it's not using any of the clocktable report filters, e.g. "thisweek" -- that's a relatively easy change you can make on line 14
 * You can adjust the path to the files on line 15.
 ​
 When you run this, it will take you away from the buffer where you put the dynamic block. I don't yet know how to not do that, I thought save-excursion would do it, but obviously not.
 ​
 feedback and improvements welcome :D

Specifically, I want to slowly replace all this code in our proprietary language with code in an off-the-shelf, functional language.

 The definition of function tramp-ensure-dissected-file-name is missing, but I could not find the definition of it in all the tramp source file.
 I tried to toggle-debug-on-quit but no useful information is given. toggle-debug-on-error does not help either.
 Does anyone know what is going on? I use straight.el btw, I am not sure if that is the issue, because the tramp I am using is the latest git version.

 I am working with a lot of TCL files where each file defines a new namespace and have class/proc definitions under the new namespace. The regexp way of creating tags for TCL mentioned here only gets the tags for procs. It doesn't qualify them with the namespace information.
 Tag Tcl files: etags --language=none --regex='/proc[ \t]+\([^ \t]+\)/\1/' *.tcl 
 I wrote a script to parse each of the TCL files and then dump out the tags for classes, its methods and procs qualified with the proper namespace information.
 for example:
 # File: f1.tcl namespace eval ::A::B { ::A::Util::new_class create C { method M1 {} { ... } self { method SM {args} { ... } } }; # class C proc P1 {} { ... } }; # namespace ::A::B

As such, this new safe interface accomplishes the same
thing that inline-java’s safe interface does; it helps to ensure safe
management of Java references at compile-time using linear types.
As discussed in this earlier post,
we need to be careful to free Java references provided by inline-java when they’re done

 I am trying to write a report in org mode of which the references are handled by org-cite. So far, everything is working really well, meaning I am able to include references from a .bib and export them to a .pdf via latex-export without any major issues.
 However I noticed the inline citations in the final pdf, print the citation number twice like so: "1[1]". I would like to get rid of the first '1' in a way the result looks like: "[1]". I am probably (not) doing something that causes this. 
 Here is what I do to replicate the issue:
 references.bib:
 @article{hello, title={Hello}, journal={Journal of Hello}, author={Test McTesty}, year={2018} }

Haskell has been used in production for years and we're actively growing the team. If you're interested in applying please use one of the following links:
 Full Time: https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/software-engineer-data-tools-82891
 Spring Internships: https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/software-engineering-internship-spring-2022-98585

 Also, please send us an email at "vehiclesoftwarerecruiting at tesla" and let us know you saw this post.
 A few frequently asked questions:
  
US work authorization required
 The full time position is in Palo Alto, CA, not remote
 Internships can be remote, but preferred to be on-site (it's more fun, anyway!)
 We're looking for candidates with 1-3 years experience developing Haskell (or an equivalent functional programming language) in a production environment. This is a flexible requirement but that is the ideal candidate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the common complaints with the Haskell ecosystem is the existence of libraries with little expository documentation. Sometimes these libraries are quite useful and, in fact, are part of the mind space of the more seasoned members of the community. Yet, for a newcomer such libraries can seem impenetrable. Yet is all hope lost? The code is there after all. That’s the documentation, right!?
 What are your strategies for familiarizing yourself (to the point of pragmatic proficiency) with a sparsely documented library? 
 Do you have any stories or tales of a time when you achieved something “great” in such a case?

I consider myself a relatively intermediate Haskeller, insofar as I understand and regularly use the more advanced parts of GHC. Though I rarely use it in production (as almost all my programming is for personal projects of interest), I find myself extremely productive in Haskell, and can generally get GHC to do what I want.
 Except when what I want is good performance. It’s not that I don’t know about laziness: I know what it is and (roughly) how it works, and I take advantage of it often enough. It’s not that I’m unaware of space leaks: if the profiler shows a great big triangle shape, or my program slows down as it runs, those are usually pretty good signs that I have one.

 It's been a daily lesson on humility. For most other languages, one week of studies at the end of a work day plus the whole weekend would be enough to have a firm grasp of its fundamentals and make decent stuff. But with Haskell it's been three weeks from monday to monady and it is kicking me hard on the butt, nuts, teeth and anyplace else that hurts. I think this is more related to the way I think as an imperative programmer (more than OO or even immutability) than being a difficult language. Maybe it is a difficult language. I don't kow.

 This answer seems to suggest there is no way to do this.
 I tried making sense of this but could not.
 Finally, I tried to wrap the function in async-start but even that did not work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using Scala and following it for years. Scala is declining in usage because Java is becoming better and Kotlin is getting pushed hard and is a smaller step for many Java developers. Personally I really love the Scala language over all the other languages I have tried. I have been following on Twitter and on Reddit and the only thing I feel is that I want to stay as far away from that mess as possible. I sugest the leaders in the comunity to travel somewhere and get a professional mediator and resolve all issues. You don't have to be friends after that but at least stop making Scala look more like daytime soap opera than an excellent comunity with smart people. You all want this to succeed. Perhaps it is more complicated and I'm being naive but from a bystanders perspective it looks pretty bad.
 The reason why I went to all the Scala conferences was because of all the smart people and the technology. Please bring back that focus and become that comunity again.
 As said before I don't have the details. I'm just describing how it looks from my perspective and others might feel different or that it's to complex to resolve these issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've been keeping track of time I've worked using this very simple format: time: 8:58-12:10 1:30-5:00 5:20-6:00 Typically a day‍ fits easily on a single line, with the advantage that it's not a major mode and can be ancient with modes such as (ORG, reStructuredText, MarkDown... etc). I keep this in the same document I maintain my work log. Recently I extracted this functionality into a package to clock in/out, and reports a summary of the last time: as well as accumulating all available times (which I use to show the time worked in a week). Link to the utimeclock repo. Locally I have the mode-line display the accumulated time for the day & week which I quite like. Although this would need some more work to split out from my init file (see this question) since it's piggy backing on which-function. ---- Before creating the package I checked on other time tracking utilities, as far as I can tell they're more verbose, and don't fit so easily into editing a text document which happens to contain a time log. Feedback welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did a little searching on the forum and didn't find a whole lot about this idea. (the main thing I found was someone's setup for creating journal entries) A lot of new note-taking applications (e.g.: Roam, Craft) have the idea of creating a dedicated note for specific days of the year when you access the application. This allows for easy access to journaling, creating stuff that you'll see on specific days, idea entry that you can sort later, etc. which I personally find to be quite nice. I don't necessarily always have some specific title in mind for something I want to write about, or even links to other things.
This seems to be a bit at odds with how The Archive wants to nudge you into adding to your Zettelkasten. And just basically somewhat opposed to the idea of creating atomic notes that are heavily interlinked, since it's more of a scattered "note" that might just have thoughts about stuff on a specific day. But I also wouldn't want to give up the ability to link to things in my Zettelkasten (and have stuff in separate locations, because goodness knows I've used a lot of applications and have notes scattered everywhere), or searchability across everything, because I want to write stuff related to specific days. (I have made at least one note in the style of the linked post, using just YYYYmmdd, which maybe just solves the issue but I haven't done much with that idea yet so I'm not sure how it might work out long term)
Does anybody have experience working with "Daily Notes" in The Archive/Zettelkastens in general? Is there something specific you do to make it work well? Is this discouraged? etc.]]></summary>

 ediff-directories is great if I want to see which files are different but I don't see with it which filenames are missing from the other directory.

I only chose company because it seemed to be the most efficient and best choice, however I am doubting that now.
 I'm asking for help here as a last resort to find solutions or personal fixes of all kinds to get simple code completion (including variable names) inside emacs using whatever module is best. What I have in mind is VSCode-like code completion with the drop down menu we can go through, however if there's an alternate kind thats fine as well. Whatever help you have, keep in mind I'm a relative emacs newbie, so if it could be explained simply / explicit config lines that would be most helpful.
 Thanks in advance.

 The only Meta key that behaves as expected is the left hand side of the space bar. I need both to behave as modifiers otherwise emacs is very difficult for me to use.
 ​
 I have started with emacs-gtk -q --no-init-file to ensure it isn't something I have enabled. The only way it works is to run emacs in the virtual console with no X.
 Even emacs in X terminals (gnome, xfce, Mate etc.) still have the right Meta disabled.
 Does anyone have an fix? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data.Vector.Unboxed essentially gives a Structure of Arrays representation - Vector (a,b) can be stored as (Vector a, Vector b). 
 This has some minor issues - deriving doesn't really work, writing the typeclass by hand is really annoying, GHC cannot optimize away dead reads if you only use one field - but overall it's a reasonably nice and composable abstraction.
 I'm currently playing with some code which accepts messages and must store them efficiently before they get batch-executed. To make this extensible I'd like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.
 But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn't matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.
 This lead me to a number of questions:
  
Is there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?
 Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational
 Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -> Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values
 Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like
  
 
type ExtractPII<Type> = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; 
 If people have ideas to any of these points I'd really like to hear about them!

 I've tried to write some functions but I cant find how to get prompted in order to paste the youtube url. 
 I've tried with a defalias function
 (defalias 'you (lambda() (interactive)(shell-command "/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads"))) 
 And also with a defun function
 (defun youtube-download () "download youtube video" (interactive) (shell-command "/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads"))` 
 Both works but I do not get prompted to paste the youtube url. What am I missing in order to get prompted so I could paste the youtube url?
 Thanks in advance.
 New Edit: Working now. Thanks to @RadicalDownist / @ieure
 (defun youtube-download (Y-URL) "Download Youtube Video" (interactive "sPaste YouTube URL: ") (shell-command (format "%s %s" "/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads" Y-URL))) 
 If you do not want any shell output buffer. Replace shell-command line with:
 (call-process-shell-command (format "%s %s" "/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads" Y-URL nil 0)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Very recently I switched to native compilation branch of emacs (aka gccemacs). It works nice so far.
 Now a few questions arrived.
  
How to clean up eln-cache? I have multiple files of the same package, all the same size. Probably the older file is obsolete, can I identify obsolete files by its date? Is there already some available mechanism to use for deleting obsolete *.eln files?
 Example:
 -rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 628720 13. Nov 01:06 yasnippet-026a6aeb-f8d0d467.eln
 -rwxrwxr-x 1 user user 628720 12. Nov 20:11 yasnippet-4376b1db-f8d0d467.eln
 
Emacs is distributed with lot of lisp files, all those compiled *.eln files are kept at ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/*/. The result is, every user on the system needs to compile those lisp files and every user allocates HDD|SSD memory for those lisp files. Is it possible to keep those *.eln files at a central location on the HDD|SSD (e.g with the emacs installation)? How to do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /r/emacs,
 recently I've been working a lot with tables (with text rather than numbers), and for the first time in years I came to the conclusion that Emacs is not the best tool for a task (especially one it could in principle be good at), and thus for now I'm doing my tables in Google Docs. 
 table.el is in principle suitable, but 
  
it is not snappy,
 having multiple lines per cell requires empty lines between them, otherwise they will be collapsed into a single line (since I need multiple lines per cell I can't use the org-mode table editor)
 it has its own separate mode which doesn't work well with org-mode (particularly I'm missing lists and org-ref links)
 it is easy to mess up the table structure by accidentally typing on the lines,
 it cannot temporarily hide rows or columns (a Google Sheets feature I didn't expect to be so handy) and
 both navigating around and repositioning columns and rows is rather tedious.
  
Of course it is still a great piece of software, but I think it can be improved. I'll start to tinker with it soon-ish, but my elisp knowledge isn't the greatest, so I thought I'd ask here if anybody has ideas where to start. In particular, I have the hunch that child frames can be used to address the lack of snappiness, the empty lines issue and the lack of org-mode integration, but I haven't used them much myself, so perhaps someone with more experience has thoughts about their appropriateness. Also if there are other ideas how to improve editing text tables I'd love to hear them.
 Cheers!

 I just set up a new host with Xubuntu 20.04 LTS which comes with GNU Emacs 26.3 (build 2, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.14) of 2020-03-26, modified by Debian.
 Of course, I'm reusing my config from here which worked on Emacs 28.0.50 (my previous host that died and had a snapshot release installed which I could not re-install) and which still works on Emacs 26.3 on another Xubuntu 20.04 LTS machine - the very same Emacs version.
 Therefore, I'm puzzled of this error message on startup:

 I have the following in my config
 (setq org-stuck-projects '("+project+LEVEL=1" ("NEXT" "IN-PROGRESS" "WAITING" "DONE" "CANCELED" "DELEGATED") nil "")) 
 And when I list stuck projects I get the correct output.
 The problem comes when I use the org-agenda-custom-commands like so:
 (setq org-agenda-prefix-format '(("r" "Weekly Review" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-skip-function '(zin/org-agenda-skip-tag "work")))) (tags-todo "+tickler-DEADLINE={.+}-SCHEDULED={.+}") (stuck) ;; problem here (todo)) ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down)) (org-agenda-files "~/.emacs.d/org/weekly-reivew-agenda-files.org")))) 
 Whenever I run this custom view, the list of stuck projects that is being produces is different than whats produces when I run the stuck projects command alone. I've tried passing the same list as I have above but doesn't change anything. I'm not sure how to debug this :(
 ​
 Org mode version 9.4.4 (release_9.4.4 @ /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/org/)
 Any ideas/hints would be appreciated! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 Yesterday, I finished up putting my first custom keyboard together. It comes with a lot of extra keys, a couple of which are bound to 'Hyper' by default. 'Hyper' is a 'modifier' provided by QMK (the firmware that powers this board) that maps to pressing 'Control-Alt-Super-Shift' all together. Because there are no default mappings in the Hyper space, it seems like a good place to put some global Emacs shortcut keys that will absolutely-for-sure not ever get clobbered.
 While it would be easier to bind C-M-s-<foo> instead of H-<foo> and get more or less the same effect, I would like to be able to utilize C-x @ h (event-apply-hyper-modifier) as an option to 'gracefully degrade' on computers where I don't have my keyboard (for example: the Chromebook I occasionally play with Emacs on). That way those global binds can stay available and reasonably within reach. It doesn't seem possible to chain C-x @ mod application functions together, but even if it were possible, chaining 4 of them together would get really old really quickly.
 I would prefer for this to get handled by Emacs instead of getting handled by the OS, just for that extra level of 'don't need to account for some random specific machine configuration', but I'm open to suggestions on what to do there if no good options exist on the Emacs level. My main machine (the one the keyboard lives at) runs mostly Fedora Workstation, and sometimes Windows 10 Pro (though I almost never use Emacs in Windows).
 Thanks, all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've finally come around to updating to org version 9.5. A change that I'm a fan of is the default for org-adapt-indentation is now nil since 9.5. However, my primary org file has been written with the hard indentation from org-adapt-indentation t. Is there an easy way to logically remove the preceding whitespace from this? I've tried using delete-whitespace-rectangle, but this doesn't preserve the indentation of subsetted bullets.
 Is there any way to essentially shift the hard tabbed indentation to the left to remove the spaces but preserve the structure?

I use the "Saved Searches" heavently, so the included Icons don't tell me enough about the saved search. I've for example "Saved Searches" for Lisp and for Haskell programming.
The easiest way would be to use the language specific icons, so I've done this, but the Icons looks not so nice in the sidebar (I use the small icons), they are blurred. Is there is a Icon size, I could use, so the icons I create look as good as the built-in ones? :-)

 newtype MyPair a = MyPair (a,a) deriving Applicative via (Data.Functor.Product (Identity a) (Identity a))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Saturday Fellow Scala People!
 Quick announcement that Indigo 0.10.0 is now available for all your FP Scala.js game building needs.
 This release features a completely re-written Clone system for when you just have to render thousands and thousands of things, and new variation on the theme called Mutants! It also contains many bug fixes, API improvements, and performance enhancements - it even works on Windows!
 Please note that this is the first Scala 3.1.0 version, so if you have an existing project you'll need to upgrade!
 Full release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.10.0
 The docs are - possibly for the first time! - up to date and are now fully checked by mdoc: https://indigoengine.io/docs/quickstart/setup-and-configuration
 We now have a Giter8 template! You could have a simple game up and running on your machine in 5 minutes - why not give it a shot? :-)
 To get started, try `g8 PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8` or `sbt new PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8` from your command line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[SOLVED] Thank you all!
 I am attempting to create a custom theme using ThemeCreator, but this problem also appears for other custom themes that aren't installed in bare Emacs, but come from the color-theme-modern package.
 For these themes, and the one I created and installed from a local file, the colors appear to be broken in my terminal (bash via GNOME terminal on Manjaro + GNOME). Using TERM="xterm-256color" changes nothing, and in fact using TERM="xterm" is slightly better (in the sense that it's closer to the original theme).
 I suspect something fishy is happening though, as the real issues set in after I agree to run the Lisp from these themes. For example, let's say I'm running wombat theme but want to switch to taylor. Everything looks fine (or what I consider fine) in wombat, I navigate up to taylor and hit enter, the colors change to something that looks nice but probably isn't Taylor (maybe some previous selection that isn't wombat), but then as soon as I allow the Lisp from Taylor to run, I get an absolutely horrible scheme that is almost unreadable.
 All appears well in GUI Emacs, but I am not interested in using that unfortunately.
 I have also tried other, more esoteric settings for the TERM variable, but to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 I've been experimenting with Org Agenda recently for my school schedule, birthdays and other TODOs. I saw on the Org layer site that it can have agenda notifications and I thought "Great, I can have an useful agenda now that can remind me stuff!"
 But I simply haven't been able to get it working no matter what, this is what I have for my org layer in .spacemacs:
 (org :variables org-enable-github-support t org-enable-reveal-js-support t org-enable-org-journal-support t org-enable-hugo-support t org-enable-sticky-header t org-enable-valign t org-enable-notifications t org-start-notification-daemon-on-startup t) 
 Here's my Spacemacs config, if it's required. (also, I'm on the develop branch and it's up to date with HEAD).
 Anyway, if I add this in my agenda:
 * TODO Go for a walk <2021-11-12 08:30> * TODO Go shopping <2021-11-12 11:00> 
 I don't receive any notifications for those 10 minutes prior. Is there something I'm missing? Is it something wrong with perhaps org-wild-notifier that seems to be the Org Agenda notifier thingie? Thanks for your time!

 Simple todos:

 * Jump 20 times [13/20] * Read 3000 words [1340/3000] 
 It doesn't make sense to break down this kind of tasks into subtasks, but I still need to track their progress in numbers.
 Ideally, I would also want org-mode to "understand" these numbers so that I can search/sort them out later.
 So, is there a good way to do this in org-mode?

I am interested in your init.el, in key-bindings, in capture-templates, tags (+filetags or others), categories (+category), other helping packages or other magic stuff I have never heard about. How is your org-roam specific ZK-workflow?
There is a lot of very good tutorial stuff out there about org-roam but not from experienced ZKlers. Even David Wilson (SystemCrafters, Emacs From Scratch) talks about that topic but do not dive into it very deep.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted to say that the new landing website is shaping up pretty nicely. I particularly like the Features page, which I wish I had when I started using Emacs. Org mode has so many features that sometimes I think newcomers get overwhelmed, and this page summarizes the most important ones and has plenty of links to good resources.
 I also use the Quickstart and the not yet complete Syntax pages when I want to remember some of aspect of the markup language.
 Thank you to the people putting in all the effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 I'm learning spark, in an exercise I have used transform in spark sql query, it is this one:
 spark.sql("""
 SELECT celsius,
 transform(celsius, t -> ((t * 9) div 5) + 32) as fahrenheit
 FROM tC
 """).show(false)
 I have defined the dataframe as follows:
 val t1 = Array(35, 36, 32, 30, 40, 42, 38)
 val t2 = Array(31, 32, 34, 55, 56)
 val tC = Seq(t1, t2).toDF("celsius")
 tC.createOrReplaceTempView("tC")
 I am trying to do the same but without using spark sql, but I can't do it. This is the code works in Databricks azure cluster,:
 tC.withColumn(
 "fahrenheit",
 transform(col("celsius"), f => ((f * 9) / 5) + 32)
 ).show(false)
 In IntelliJ IDEA does not work. The errors are:
 - Cannot resolve symbol *
 - Cannot resolve symbol /
 - Cannot resolve symbol +
 Thanks for your help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After using The Archive for some time,  there is one feature I couldn't get used to it: the ESC shortcut for Reset Search. It happens quite often that while I'm writing a note I end up pressing ESC twice in a row (for example to cancel a search in the note, or the spelling box), and suddenly I lose the view of the note. While I can easily go back to the note, it still takes a bit of time to find the line I was at. Plus, there is an annoying break in the flow.
I was wondering if others had a similar experience and if they have a solution. Maybe redefining ESC with Keyboard Maestro, in such a way that one can still use this to cancel the other boxes (find, spelling etc.)? I find the role of ESC to Reset Search more intuitive in the Omnibar (when it's active), rather than in the body of the note itself.]]></summary>

 i'm using it to work with some scala 3 code courtesy of metals (0.10.9) and LSP. that's because i can't bring myself to invest time in vs code and because i've already set the record for intellij idea bug reports related to their scala plugin and scala 3:-). until recently, this setup worked well. 
 but during the last week, something strange started to happen. i use the tab bar in multiple windows. in one window with primarily text files, i was able to use the mouse to interact with the bar successfully (e.g. selecting a tab, closing a tab). but in a window dedicated to working with scala 3 code, use of the mouse with the tab bar began to fail.
 any attempt to interact via mouse button one triggered the error "<nil> <mouse-1> is undefined". "<nil>"? "describe-key" only sees the "<mouse-1>" event, no "<nil>". if i switch from Scala mode to Fundamental mode, normal behavior returns (the mouse can select tabs, close tabs, etc). if i turn Scala mode back on, the failures return.
 i'm looking for suggestions about how to debug this. thoughts/comments?

 how it shows on small characters like ";" https://imgur.com/a/axr9Ot4
 how it shows on bigger characters like "x" https://imgur.com/a/S6pgAkl
 ​
 I really need to fix this cause i wanna work on this new machine instead of ubuntu. On ubuntu this issue is non existent.

 Haskell has separate namespaces for types and values. When types and data constructors share a name, Haddock, Haskell’s documentation generator, can get confused. In this post I show how to disambiguate types and values in Haddock documentation.

 For example, [[id:some-guid][Link Name]] would be a different color than [[file+emacs:file-path][My File]]. 
 Has anyone tried to do this before? 
 Just to clarify, the idea is not to apply different styles when publishing, but rather in-buffer. 
 (Bonus: how would you hook into a theme palette when specifying color?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working with Scala (Functional) and Clojure for the last ~ 4 years but I still can't give a proper brief answer whenever someone asks me "Hey, what is FP and why should I use it?" 
 I generally start with concepts like immutability, local reasoning, referential transparency, functions as first class citizens, currying etc. But I soon find myself going all over the place. For example, I find myself giving unconvincing arguments when someone asks me "what practical benefit does referential transparency actually provide to the developer?"
 There are arguments like imperative programming depends on the order of execution of statements, while FP is declarative. But FP also depends on the order of execution (you insert into database and then read, you can't do vice-versa). Sure, you can say that "ordering" that we are talking about here is in the context of mutating global state. There isn't any global state in FP. But at the core of it ordering does matter right?
 Then there is the argument that immutability allows use of different cores in parallel. But I have never seen this happening in any business application, i.e, immutability used to parallelize processing. Sure, making a value immutable makes it thread safe (since no one can change it). But most real life scenarios require mutability. So we model them as Atomic, Ref etc and make them thread safe. But these things exist in imperative languages as well. So, what exactly is the connection between immutability and parallel processing & thread safety.?
 Then we have the lazy evaluation of IO which provides referential transparency. I have used IO and I love it. But I can't seem to find practical/objective points as to what benefits it provides. So when I say that all my DB operations and external API calls are an IO, I again find myself giving unconvincing answers about their benefits.

I sometimes do programming livestreams and typically use Emacs as my editor to try and introduce it to those who may not even be aware it exists. Since I am not much of a LISP developer, I feel like this is the best I can do to support the software and get more people using it; but I have found myself wondering how else I can contribute or introduce more people to Emacs. In my experience, once people realize how cool and versatile it is, they quickly become curious about its various functionalities. How can I help Emacs maintain its longevity?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I've been iterating over my previous shot at a Big Sur style icon and I've produced a new version that I consider to be more polished and hopefully a bit less amateurish. The changes are:
 - The background is now vectorized and sports a slight shadow at the sides and bottom, this is based on a svg template for Big Sur icons. It should be easy to make the background circular or squircular for those of you that prefer so.
 - I further smoothed the curves by removing extra degrees of freedom.
 - The logo shadow is now blurry and less opaque.
 - There is a subtle radial gradient that spotlights the logo and turns darker near the edges.
 - The upper and lower halves of the logo are slightly more proportionate.
 I've learned the basics of Inkspace and, against my expectations, I actually enjoyed using it :)
 I'm sharing a png image and its svg source (not permalinks, sorry, I promise to keep them online for some weeks at least).
 - png: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BDnwlGa17ds0CZI1kNBNghqt4TSqVEl/view?usp=sharing
 - svg: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14L_roGCSD9dMnhL4Cq3w2_sfP4vvlk0_/view?usp=sharing
 Hope you like it.

 Is it possible to make the Escape key send Ctrl-g just during evil/isearch?

 2) make the menu contain:

 xref-find-definitions for text which is marked in region
 ack for text which is marked in region

 However, version 9.2.1 of that package seems to have a dependency that has been included to deliberately make it impossible to build (depends on unbuildable (>1 && <1)).
 Is there an ETA when a working version will arrive on Hackage or some kind of workaround for this issue? I could not find anything on the GHC issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The red book talks a lot about Laws, but I don't understand the concept and why it's useful. For example in the chapter 9 about Parser, it says that that map is structure preserving and one can stipulate that law the following way: map(p)(a => a) == p
 What does this actually mean and why is it useful? 
 Then they go on to make their laws executable by using a library:
 import fpinscala.testing._ trait Parsers[ParseError, Parser[+_]] ... object Laws { def equal[A](p1: Parser[A], p2: Parser[A])(in: Gen[String]): Prop = forAll(in)(s => run(p1)(s)== run(p2)(s)) def mapLaw[A](p: Parser[A])(in: Gen[String]): Prop = equal(p, p.map(a => a))(in) } } 
 How is this different from testing? What is actually happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a project with ~200 hundred files and I wanted to move all of them one level deeper, so that all of my modules become prefixed with the name of the project. This results in me needing to rename all the module names, all the imports of those modules, and then also qualified calls in the code.
 Compiler guides me through that but it is a lot of manual work so I wrote a small script that does most of the work for me - it updated module names to reflect their paths and also corrects old imports to use the new name (it doesn't take care of qualified calls though).
 Script is pretty naive, in the sense that it uses just regexes and therefore risks false positives, but it actually worked very well for my use case, I had only 2 false positives which I easily fixed. I still needed to do manual work to find those false positives and I needed to correct qualified calls, but it still felt like much less work than without using the script.
 Script: https://github.com/wasp-lang/misc/blob/master/hs-fix-modules.hs .
 How would you go about this problem, what do you do / use? I tried looking for existing solutions, including retrie, but it didn't seem anything out there supports this kind of refactoring.
 If I wanted to make a proper solution that parses the code and looks at AST in order to figure out what needs to be updated -> how would I go about that, where would I start, and is that feasible?

 ```elisp

 But FiraCode does not support italic, so currently my emacs can't display italic.
 I found another font that supports italic and matches FiraCode font: Dejavu Sans Mono
 Now I want to mix both fonts. Main font must be FiraCode and I hope only italic letters are displayed by Dejavu Sans Mono.
 Is it possible for emacs to do this? I hope so and I am expecting it can do that. How can I write proper configuration to achieve that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am writing some bit level functions for Word128 data type in Haskell, and one function involves extracting n bits from the t-th least significant bit in a word x. I also intend to write a function that will essentially be a reverse of this above function of extraction (a function that basically restores the extracted bits). I have designed a C pseudo code for the extraction function, and this what I have written so far for the extraction function in Haskell-
 In C :
 extractBits (unsigned int x, int t, int n) mask = ((1<<n)-1)<<t; unsigned int extractedBits = x & mask;
 In Haskell :
 extractBits :: Word 128 -> Integer -> Integer -> Word128 extractBits x t n = x .&. (shiftL ((shiftL 1 n) -1) t)
 The above code seems to be fine type wise. However, a suggested solution that we have for this function is as follows -
 extractBits x t n = shiftL ( x .&. (shiftL 1 n-1)) t
 Not quite sure however I think the function above does not seem to be logically the same as my implementation? They are giving different results for some values. Does it have something to do with how overflow is handled by each if these functions? 
 Additionally, I am having trouble thinking about the reverse of this function and how it can be implemented. Any suggestions if possible would be much appreciated. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I am a new user of emacs, and really exploring the configuration options around. But I just found some very annoying aspects that are driving me crazy.
 First:
 How on earth can I just use tabs in a sane way?
 In VSCode I found tabs pretty smart. Press the key once, and it dropped you on the correct indentation level for the line, press it more times and it inserted spaces to your liking. In emacs apparently the default behavior stops at the first part, but for example, in PHP I'm writing a SQL string and to avoid wraping I press enter, but then it goes to the beginning of the line and if I press tab it just won't work because it thinks it is still at the correct level of indentation. and to correct the string I have to press space for doing so. I have no idea how to search for this in google, and the few posts I found give no solution whatsoever, and some say "just get used to it".
 Second:
 Are modes always "wonky"? For example, I am writing PHP at the moment, and web mode is pretty deficient for it, inserting a ">" character when I write "<" in a comparison because it thinks I'm writing an html tag. For that I installed PHP-mode, and now... formatting the file is impossible because it says that clang-formatter is not found. For web mode I installed Apheleia, and it works fine, but now I can't use it with PHP-mode. So how can I configure it so it works?
 And when I was just using web-mode, it suddenly, and apparently at random, just go back to fundamental mode. And had to enable web-mode manually several times. This is what made me install PHP-mode in the first place.
 I hope someone has an idea of how to fix this stuff, or at least point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, 
 I am currently working through the LYAH book and on the bottom of this page it goes into creating a Monad by example. So far, so good... 
 The only thing I can't get my head around at all is the final function:
 import Data.List (all) flipThree :: Prob Bool flipThree = do a <- coin b <- coin c <- loadedCoin return (all (==Tails) [a,b,c]) 
 In my head a <- coin results in a being: [(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)]
 same for b, and for c it results in [(Heads,1%10),(Tails,9%10)] 
 Now.. why does (all (==Tails) [a,b,c]) work?
 When I am loading it up in ghci and trying
 all (==Tails) [[(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)],[(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)],[(Heads,1%10),(Tails,9%10)] ]
 results in (as expected) countless errors.

 any help is appreciated, thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys!
 I'm in the middle of a project in which I need to do some kind of upsert to a nested map structure (3 levels deep), creating all the intermediate keys if they don't exist and just retrieving them and continue going down if they do. The structure would be something similar to this:
 haskell data NestedMap = M.Map Key1 (M.Map Key2 (M.Map Key3 [Item])) 
 You can assume Key* and Item are simple Strings.
 I wanted to try using Lens to do it, but I'm having trouble understanding some concepts. For example, I have seen that to manipulate map-like structures in this way at should be used, as well as non to provide the keys when missing and continue operating. However, when looking at the docs for non I have found this:
  &gt;&gt;&gt; Map.fromList [("hello", 1)] &amp; at "hello" . non 0 +~ 2 fromList [("hello",3)] &gt;&gt;&gt; Map.fromList [("hello", 1)] &amp; at "hello" . non 0 -~ 1 fromList [] 
 I don't understand the second result at all. Shouldn't the result be something like fromList [("hello", 0)]? Why it's not the case?
 To be honest I'm also having trouble trying to think on how could I chain all the ^.s, ats, nons and ?~s into an expression to finally add a [Item] at the bottom of the nested map, but as I'm not understanding the non function I'll need to go step by step.
 Could someone please help me understand this better? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellow 'macsers,
 TL;DR: wanna compile a number of lists (tracklists to show friends, one list per year), maybe in a kind of database. I want duplicates to be detected. Ideally, I want the ability to export to a nice-looking format. Package tips, programming suggestions, everything welcome. Thanks :)
 I have a somewhat unconventional taste of music - at least when compared to my friends. I rarely play music I enjoy personally other than some beat tapes which are simply lit when hangin' out together.
 Now, I have been asked by one friend of mine to compile a list of music that I have enjoyed throughought the year. Since I actually enjoy sharing/discussing music, I agreed. So I compiled a list of songs - free form, no format etc. 
 However, I've been wondering: I might be doing this every year from now on. First off, it was a bit tedious to do the freeform entry. Secondly, and more important, I don't want to manually search for duplicates when compiling my 2022 list. Finally, it would be nice if I could have this list (or a subset of such a list) exported either in a nice-looking pdf or in some other conventient form. 
 Then, I thought to myself: well, since you can do practically everything with emacs, why shouldn't it be able to help me out this time?
 Thus, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter. It might be some kind of database thingy that is able (programmably) to detect duplicates. It might be a program that does EXACTLY what I want. It might be a hint on how to do autonumbering on an unformatted file. It might be a tip on how to automate the "finding duplicates" process. Anything, really :)
 Thanks a bunch, have a good day, fellows! :)

Linked information systems
In providing a system for manipulating this sort of information, the hope would be to allow a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve with the organisation and the projects it describes. For this to be possible, the method of storage must not place its own restraints on the information. This is why a "web" of notes with links (like references) between them is far more useful than a fixed hierarchical system. When describing a complex system, many people resort to diagrams with circles and arrows. Circles and arrows leave one free to describe the interrelationships between things in a way that tables, for example, do not. The system we need is like a diagram of circles and arrows, where circles and arrows can stand for anything.


From Tim Berners-Lee's original proposal for the worldwide web. Emphasis mine.
It is quite fascinating how this fact seems to be rediscovered again and again.]]></summary>

In /r/AskProgramming, it has been received very well. All of the commenters engaged with the actual question.
 
In /r/functionalprogramming, it has not been received so well. Many commenters declined to engage with the question.

 I'd like to avoid using the minibuffer-setup-hook for simplicity's sake. The simple functionality I'm after is inserting the text at point as the first minibuffer text for the yas-insert-snippet command, but I can foresee needing similar functionality in more complex circumstances.

I thought emacs-jedi (for python) was something close, but not fully what I was looking for. Any suggestions for just python or just tcl or both (preferably) is highly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a couple of things that come to mind as a prelude to this issue:
  
switched to ZSH and Oh-My-ZSH a couple of days ago. 
 built Emacs 29 (latest from source) today on Ubuntu 20.04.
  
After installing the newly built Emacs, I noticed that the icon in the Ubuntu Dock didn't seem to work. I removed the icon. I then went into Applications and launched an instance of Emacs. It worked. I added it to the favorites in the dock. I closed the instance. I then went to click the icon again. It opened a weird Emacsclient instance, which didn't split the frame into three windows like it always does at startup (I have this written in .emacs).
 To summarize, whenever I launch from the applications, I can start a "normal" Emacs version. As soon as I add its icon to the dock, the icon begins launching Emacs(client) version.
 In the applications, I have three icons: Emacs, Emacs(client), Emacs(Terminal).
 Any help on figuring out what is going on is appreciated. For one, I would love to learn what this client thing is as I have never seen nor used it. It would also be great to get to the usual behavior of just getting good old Emacs after clicking the icon in the dock. If there is reason to this client madness and it can be beneficial in this case, I am all ears.

The subject is automating texture management through using statically analyzable code to implement the games and then analyze certain functions for the textures they use.
 The reason I need source code for games written in Haskell is to be able to compare metrics from a game without my added structures and typeclasses vs with my typeclasses. I would change the way the game is written using my classes and see what the impact is on performance, compile size/time, memory usage. 
 I will cite all the games used and their developers of course. I've found some github repositories here and there of finished games, but wanted to see if any of you know of some good resources.

I like Haskell. In my experience, it is at once the strongest and the most approachable programming language in the world. Haskell is the answer to the problems raised by John Backus and Edsger Dijkstra. It also has a community that I am honoured to be among. So, whenever I see a problem that can be solved by a computation, I want to have a solution in Haskell because I expect it to naturally turn out better than an alternative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce the release of Copilot 3.6, a stream-based DSL for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones.
 This new release supports three new operators: atan2, floor, and ceiling. Additionally, the target directory of the code generated by Copilot can now be customized. Release 3.6 also includes a battery of unit tests for the library copilot-core. This release introduces other fixes in the code and in the documentation, and deprecates definitions that have been superseded or that were largely unused.
 Current emphasis is on facilitating the use with other systems, and improving the codebase in terms of stability and test coverage. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started with JavaScript.
 Indium is suggested everywhere as the standard development environment for JavaScript, so I've used it with some success. It works beautifully for Chrome, with evaluation of code, inspection, REPL, etc. but only up to a point.
  
When it comes to Node, I've no success. I can start the node server but I cannot connect to it. I'm not sure it starts the node server correctly; in the documentation it says that you can start the node server manually and then connect to it, but the code says otherwise (it always asks if you want to close the previous connection, doing nothing if you chose `no`, starting a new server if you choose `yes`)
 Evaluating TypeScript code leads to errors, even though the documentation and the discussions that I've seen lead to the impression that evaluating TypeScript should be no different than evaluating JavaScript code.
 Async functions cannot be evaluated with `indium-eval-last-node` since it only evaluates the code after the `function` token, ignoring the `async` token, which leads to the error that `await` cannot be used in non-async functions.
 The Indium setup documentation references functions that are no longer available, like `M-x indium-connect-to-nodejs`
 the last commit is from March 2021 and there are still open issues from 2017 and no responses from the developer
  
Developing such a huge and nice package is surely overwhelming. I (and maybe others) would just like to know if we should bother with it, that's all. There might also be some people who would like to take it over, who knows. Does anyone have any info regarding this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a problem to solve which I'm almost sure has been encountered by people before (so expecting there to be reasonable library for that), but I don't know what exactly to search for. - I'd like to run potentially long-running actions triggered by some user HTTP requests in a web app - These actions have to run on the server receiving that request. Imagine something like initializing user-scoped sqlite file in the filesystem where the haskell web server binary is running (so no external "job runner" service) - The actions should run in separate thread (async?) - For any user, there should be at most 1 parallel copy of that action running at any given time (i.e. if user triggers 2nd copy of that action while the first is still running, the 2nd action should be skipped)
 My idea about solution so far includes: - some data structure (?) for managing bunch of locks, addressed by integers (user ids) - ensure locks are released both when the async action fails or succeeds
 Here's a dirty prototype (most likely not bug free) demonstrating what I'd like to achieve https://gist.github.com/jhrcek/5123bc0ad42522dff837be5580e9766e
 Is anyone aware of some libraries that would make this kind of thing possible?

 From my research it looks like EAF is the best option for that. From their docs it seems like they support Windows. I did the full install as the Readme advises and everything seems to be working fine. At least the "demo" application runs as expected.
 With eaf-browser i'm at a dead-end though. All i get is an empty buffer and a Message "Process *eaf* exited abnormally with code 9". No further Information what failed. All dependencies are installed, update runs through fine.
 Has anyone gotten this to work under Windows?
 My current config for eaf looks like this:
  (use-package eaf :load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/" :custom (eaf-browser-continue-where-left-off t) (eaf-browser-enable-adblocker t) (browse-url-browser-function 'eaf-open-browser) :config (require 'eaf-browser) (require 'eaf-pdf-viewer) (require 'eaf-demo) (eaf-bind-key nil "M-q" eaf-browser-keybinding)) 
 Any help on this would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My new goal this year is to learn a new programming language and do at least one project with it. My current (uneducated) choice is between Haskell and C. 
 I’ve written down bullet points to help organize my thoughts, and I was wondering if anyone could share their thoughts on what to learn first and correct me if any of my thoughts are biased. I would really appreciate it!
 Here’s a little context for me first:
  
On a gap year before entering college as freshman next year
 Have done Java as part of intro to CS class + Python for majority of projects (overall ~3 yrs of coding experience)
 Interested in pursuing Machine Learning / ML Systems
  
My short term goal:
  
Push outside my comfort zone and gain a deeper understanding/practices in programming
 Prepare myself for rigorous CS curriculums I’ll soon face
 Hopefully, gain a small advantage in resume screenings when I apply for DevOps/MLOps internships after sophomore year.
  
Why Haskell?
  
The idea of Functional Programming itself interests me, and many have said it’s a great way to push outside the comfort zone and understand more deeply about ‘programming’
 I’ve heard many companies use Haskell for their “low-latency, high-volume database access”
 Project Ideas: Map-reduce?
  
Why C? (Or maybe C++)
  
Learning C will expose me to more fundamental inner workings of computer systems.
 As I am interested in ML Systems, I’ve heard “writing highly performant/error-proof systems-level code” is an essential skill to have/practice
 Project Ideas: Database, Distributed File System

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been an emacs user for years now and have yet to find a jsx/tsx setup that works perfectly (indentation, AC, etc). If anyone has a configuration they think works perfect, please post it. If not, I’ve been learning elisp for some time, but am at the point where I need to build something. Is anyone with experience (preferably also interested in having such a major mode) willing to help me make something like this? React is so popular and really needs solid emacs support
 With tree-sitter and lsp, I’m guessing it shouldn’t be that hard? Assuming the hardest part will be getting the indentations right

 Is it possible (in other words is there a Melpa package I guess) that lets me specify scheduled tasks with a duration:

 rather than 
  * TODO ... SCHEDULED: <2021-11-08 Mon 15:00-16:00> 
 Note that in the first sample I specify 15:00hr + 1 hour rather than second example where I have to calculate the end time myself.

        <updated>2021-11-08T18:24:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently reached an initial milestone in the development of SLinC (Scala Link to C), a library in the vein of Java Native Access and Java Native Runtime. I'm designing SLinC to use cats' `Free` monad for a native effect type called NativeIO, and it's powered by Scala 3's macros and Java 17's foreign incubator.
 An example usage of SLinC is binding to stdlib.h's div method:
 C representation
 struct div_t { int quot; int rem; }; div_t div(int numerator, int denominator); 
 Scala 3 binding and usage
 //scala representation of div_t struct type div_t = Struct { val quot: int val rem: int } //method binding for c stdlib's div val div = NativeIO[(Int, Int) => div_t]("div") //usage of our binding //Struct returns require native memory allocation, so an allocation scope is needed Native.scope( for result <- div(5,2) quot = result.quot.get rem = result.rem.get yield println(s"quotient: $quot, remainder: $rem") ) //natively allocated data is freed after this point .foldMap(NativeIO.impureCompiler) //compiles and runs the native kernel we just defined, prints "quotient: 2, remainder: 1" 
 The library is still in development, so it's not as fully featured as JNA or JNR, but I'm hoping to improve it in the coming month. It's also very promising performance-wise: despite me not putting much of any effort into optimization, it's already rivaling JNR in performance, and resoundingly beats JNA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I compiled Emacs PGTK Nativecomp and running it on my machine which is fairly good. Surely, using nativecomp is a new experience and everything felt very fast as compared to Emacs 27. But yesterday, I was facing Emacs freeze while editing a simple dockerfile which is hardly 100 lines ig and I inspected it in Htop and found that Emacs using 100% CPU. Then I killed emacs and run another instance and profiled it while editing same dockerfile but again I left with freezed Emacs. Again I tried same and found in profiler that evil (especially evil-ex command), timer.el(IDK what it is) and selectrum(precisely selectrum--update) using CPU. Then I removed evil packages from my init.el and replaced selectrum with vertico. Now, Emacs is usable. But it still lags (not freezes) in between and its due to native compilation turned on. 
 Is this only happening to me or anyone else facing same issue? Is there any workaround for it?

 1st of all, I don't mean for blog posts, like emacs's org2blog package. I mean to actually develop the wordpress site itself by coding in emacs.
 Is there a simple way to do this?
 I'm guessing I'll need ssh, tramp, git, ftps, etc... to set this up?
 Thanks in advance for the help!

 ​
 Unfortunately, it looks like macOS Monterey regressed the performance of vfork, which means magit is once again slow and gets slower the more packages you have loaded. See https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2017-04/msg00201.html
 I'm curious if anyone out there has an M1 Mac w/ Monterey and Emacs 27.2 or greater and would be willing to run this and report back the timing information:
 (benchmark 100 '(call-process "/usr/bin/true" nil nil nil))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I've been learning haskell for school and I have an exercise Im trying to do where I have to implement a function firstWhen :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Maybe a, 
 the function is meant to return Just n if n is the first member that satisfies the condition and Nothing if no member satisfies the condition. So my first thought is to use foldl since it will check everything from the left to the right and I have my accumulator set to Nothing. 
 My current implementation is: 
 firstWhen p = foldl (\acc x -> if p x then Just x else Nothing ) Nothing
 The problem is it always returns the result for the final member. is there some way to make the function return the first member that satisfies the condition and then stop iterating? or am I thinking about this the wrong way? Thanks in advance for any tips or gentle nudges in the right direction :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I am currently trying to learn some haskell by going throught he LYAH book and got two questions.
 ​
 1) I think it was written when Applicative was not required for the Monad typeclass. It states in this capter (http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more) that there are some functions that do the same as the functions on Functors. But specifically written for Monads (e.g. liftM and fmap; ap and <*>).
  
Which ones are you using?
 Is there a rule of thumb?
 Perhaps something like "always liftM when the value is an instance of Monad and only fmap when it is an instance of Applicative and not of Monad?"
  
​
 2) There is a small task to do this tightrope walker example (http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads) with the Either type instead of the Maybe type.Thats what I did here and wondered if I could use the state Monad in combination with the Either Monad to clean up the code by avoiding all these ```first <- landLeft start second <- landLeft first etc..```
  
Is this possible? ( I did not yet fully grasp the State Monad stuff, so it would also be a decent practice I guess)
  
​

 thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are there good options for automatically adjusting text size for a frame based on the current display?
 I didn't find anything so I made a small package textsize that currently fits my needs quite well. It automatically chooses a font point size for the default face for the current frame, based on:
  
monitor resolution: if it's lower res, typically want a smaller point size
 pixel pitch: higher point size on finer pitch screens
 manual per-frame adjustment available to shift the calculated value
  
For me there is one current omission where automatic adjustment is fired via window-size-change-functions, which does not fire if the resolution is unchanged. e.g. Going from my 1080p laptop to a 1080p external. The only options I've seen for that require polling, which feels kind of distasteful. Anyone know of triggers I might catch for that?
 I could add rules around monitor size and/or frame size, though personally I haven't particularly wanted it. The manual adjustment is available for transient needs.
 I'd welcome comments both on the functionality, how I achieved it.
  
Is this reinventing another wheel I didn't find? This EmacsWiki page outlines some details but I didn't see automatic adjustment.
 
I feel like my coding of 'thresholds' is clunky and a little obtuse - are the Elisp examples of something similar that's cleaner and clearer?
 
My default pixel pitch thresholds are guesses, as my day-to-day doesn't have a lot of variation on that.
 
 If you want to try it, load textsize.el and run (textsize-setup), and move things between disparate monitors (providing their resolution isn't the same!). Tweak the customizations and let me know if you think the defaults could be better or if you would want other rules.
 I can put it on MELPA if there's interest, but I feel like it could do with a bit more depth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm a psychology student from an Eastern European country. Currently I'm using the method to learn more about the neuroscience of emotions and personality psychology and how they are related to each other.
I was reading some neuroscience textbooks in the past few days and I wanted to take notes from them, because I know little to nothing about neuroscience. However, I have some trouble with finding connections between the notes in my Zettelkasten (probably because there are only two dozen notes and because I have deleted my previous Zettelkästen a few times).
I thought that knowing the types of links would help me with making the connections. These are the types of connections I know of yet:
So, do you think that having a personal typology of link types is helpful in making more meaningful connections between ideas?
(P.S. Stupid me deleted my previous Zettelkästen because I wasn't satisfied with the connections I made. Most of them were of the type "This is a note about object X, this is another note about object X, I can sense a connection!", which is a link type better encapsulated with a tag. Because of that I got few insights over the months I had been using the method.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using mu4e for a year and I am fairly satisfied with it except for how slow it can be. This slowness really annoys me when mu re-indexing blocks all other email operations including opening emails.
 I decided to switch to notmuch instead and upon configuring it (based on prot's config) it seems much faster and the fact that there can be multiple open searches and emails is a huge draw for me.
 However, there are features in mu4e that I want to replicate in notmuch, at least in the beginning while I get used to the tags system. These include:
  
Moving messages between folders and deleting messages.
 Multiple accounts and automatic context switching. In mu4e, when replying to an email the correct email account is used.
 Viewing messages from a search without the related messages in a thread. The tree-view includes all messages in a thread (and is not aligned correctly by default) and the non-tree view shows a list of threads rather than messages.
  
Does anyone have a configuration that implements these features?
 Finally, to be able to use tags, I am wondering if there's a way to sync notmuch's arbitrary tags with the mail server. I have two machines that access the same mail server and I want to configure notmuch on them separately, replicating the email tags (I cannot ssh to either machine from the other and I don't want to rely on a Dropbox like service to sync the notmuch database).

 ​
 But I think Monads are likely overmystified, what with the burritos and all. One thing, after I finish getting Monads, is that I'd like to explain Monads to my mother. She's not a programmer by trade, but was studying for a Java certification years back, so it might be a little bit easier.
 ​
 I'm wondering, does anyone else want to explain Monads to their mother? Even if they didn't want to do so, would you have a strategy for explaining Monads to your mother? Come and share, both proposals and experiences!

I followed this advice and got a bunch of feedback loops and not a lot of structure. I started giving myself permission to use Structure Notes as much as I want, and I find these structure notes to be much more helpful than direct links from one note to the next.
If I have a stream of thought that spans 10 notes, I find it easier to back to the structure note to click through each note than to do a whole bunch of to/from links in each note.
Anybody else experience this? Anything I'm missing out by not linking directly?]]></summary>

 I have tried connecting to a local mac machine and a VPS. Tramp stucks at "Tramp: Opening connection nil for user@host using ssh...failed". I toggled debug on quit, and find that tramp stuck at tramp-maybe-open-connection . I also tried to use my mac machine to connect back to my arch machine, the mac machine is also on the latest commit ba278e4a9b, and they both have the same issue. Also, I have tried to open emacs using emacs -Q , but tramp failed also without loading my config.
 Tramp was working a week ago. All I did is compile Emacs from the latest source. 
 I am curious to see if that is my problem or a bug in Emacs. Does anyone of you unable to use tramp using the latest commit?
 Is there anything I can do to find out what is going wrong?

I'm working on a problem that requires an algorithm that finds all sequences of natural numbers that add up to a given number. So, for example, 4 is broken down into `[[1,1,1,1],[1,1,2],[1,3],[4],[2,2]]`. There's a solution online I found (https://origin.geeksforgeeks.org/find-all-combinations-that-adds-upto-given-number-2/), but it's for other imperative languages and doesn't translate well to Haskell. I managed to write an algorithm that works (I think), but seems to be terrible inefficient for higher numbers. I think trying to parse through it would just further confuse anyone reading. I was wondering what someone more well versed in the ins and outs of Haskell would do to implement this algorithm. Thanks.

When using `lsp-ui`, the documentation viewer, which appears in a childframe, causes a blank frame to be created when emacs is in full screen. This appears to happen with other apps as well that use childframes. 
 I've disabled using a child frame for the doc which is upsetting because the in frame version is way worse and doesn't have clickable links.
 Anyone know of a workaround? I'm new to emacs and still just trying to get my emacs config to work without major bugs.

 Recently I realized I have no idea how should I define version bounds for my library and I got pretty confused before I finally figured out the reasoning behind it (thanks to r/haskell and Adam Bergmark from Stackage), so I thought I would capture that reasoning in a short article: https://github.com/wasp-lang/haskell-handbook/blob/master/dependencies-version-bounds.md .
 I would appreciate any feedback, be it if I got something wrong or if I could improve clarity in some way.
 Article is aimed for Haskell developers that are publishing a library for the first time or are about to distribute their first executable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realize this is a common question - e.g. see here but I want to ask a slight variation on the usual case.
 I have created my own class file with definitions called my_article.cls, with code like:
 \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e} \ProvidesClass{my_article}[Article class with style modifications ] \LoadClass{article} \RequirePackage{titlesec} \RequirePackage{setspace} \onehalfspacing \RequirePackage[a4paper, hscale=0.8, vscale=0.8, includehead]{geometry} \RequirePackage{amsmath} \RequirePackage{amsfonts} \RequirePackage{amssymb} \RequirePackage{graphicx} \titleformat{\subsection}[hang] {\large\fontfamily{lmss}\mdseries\raggedright} {\thesubsection} {1em} {\underline} 
 To use this normally, I put this file in the same folder as the .tex file I am editing, and use \documentclass[11pt,letterpaper]{my_article}.
 I want to port this to org-mode, so that I can specify something like #+LATEX_CLASS: my_class at the start of the document.
 Is there someway that I can do this without having to repeatedly copy the .cls file into the working directory of the org file? I.e. specify this in my init.el file? For instance, this method in the worg tutorials is often suggested, but it seems to be for org-mode < v8.0.
 An alternative I've tried is to use #+SETUPFILE:~/my_template.org, which is a file that contains various #+LATEX_HEADER:\usepackage{} lines. This works for declaring which packages are necessary, and for defining shortcuts, but I'm not sure it will work for defining pagestyles for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings everyone!
 I am very new to the programming world and was introduced to this world by a friend of mine. After several hours of researching I accidentally stumbled upon haskell & the world of functional programming!
 At this very moment, I find myself puzzled about whether I should mainly write in haskell or not since the syntax of haskell, compared to other prgoramming languages, is rather more attractive I dare say.
 So I am here to kindly request help from more knowledgable haskell programmers to help me answer several questions that I am currently struggling to find answers to:
  
Should I be worried about software performance in general? I have been considering writing several applications in haskell that are somewhat performance dependent and as previously mentioned, I would rather have them be written in haskell than not if the performance is not strongly affected by this.
 Does haskell have good graphics libraries? If so, what is the performance disadvantage it has compared to languages like C/C++? I am interested in working with something similar to Inigo Quilez work.
 What is the current status of AI research in haskell? From my very simple searching, I noticed that it's not a popular programming language in the field of AI and I am honestly confused about why that is. Perhaps someone more knowledgable about this can explain to me why a language closer to mathematics is somehow further away from the mathematical research environment.
  
Other than that, I would like to thank you all for keeping this subreddit alive for newcomers like me to explore & learn from!

 However, that does not work. In the `heroku logs` it says that it can't find said directory. Also tried removing the production keyword for the command as suggested in a stack overflow question. Also tried ./dist/build/appname and every other variation :))

 Does anyone know how that path is chosen? Is it somehow linked with the buildpack that I've used?

 Pretty sure I'm just being stupid but I can't make blame echo work. The headings just appear empty.
 If I use `magit-blame` again and cycle styles, a couple of them actually works fine so maybe there's something wrong with font colours?
 Any ideas?

 allUppercase :: [Char] -> Bool

 So far, my code looks like this:
 allUppercase [] = False
 allUppercase (x:xs)
 | isUpper x == True = allUppercase (xs)
 | isUpper x == False = False
 Which always returns False. How do I make it return True?

 https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/issues/313 for a long thread of on some of the issues
 The main issues I have had are due to navigating when in normal mode and then switching back to insert mode (cursor can jump back to end of line) and other editing features like "Change-Inner-Word". 
 I have also tried disabling evil in Vterm and using a Vim mode for zsh, but that is super slow and unresponsive (changing modes takes like 0.5-1 second).
 Im pretty new to being evil, so wanted to know if anyone has any nice vterm setup to recommend. I have tried the solutions offered in that issues thread, but haven't had too much success.

One person described the book he read as "a chaotic mess...It read, in my opinion, like something written by a sentient library catalog, full of disordered and tangential insights, loosely related to one another."
While I know that a great guitar builder can be a terrible guitarist, I wonder if it matters that the "founding father" of the Zettelkasten system wrote books that felt disorganized and random.
[And I understand Luhmann wasn't writing for the masses but for the sociology community, so maybe his writing was par for the academic course.]]]></summary>

 Tab completion for structure template expansion isn't working on my end.
 I can run C-c C-, to select my templates for inserting source blocks and such, but running say `<p TAB` to try and insert a python source block doesn't seem to work (meanwhile C-c C-, p works totally fine).
 Couldn't find any recent posts on here, so just wanted to ask quickly before I do a deep dive and see if I have made an error.
 Emacs Version: 27.2
 Org Version: 9.4.4

 Just wanted to see if anyone else has had similar issues, or if I am being a Gordan Ramsey certified idiot sandwich :p

 EDIT: Solved, as u/john_bergmann pointed out just needed to activate org-tempo module.

 I recently started reading A prettier printer by Phil Wadler, which describes his algorithm for formatting documents. After describing the core operations, Wadler introduces the following laws required to reduce a document to normal form, "taken together with the fact that <> is associative with unit nil":
 -- text is a homomorphism from ++ to <> text (s ++ t) = text s <> text t text "" = nil -- nest is a homomorphism from + to composition nest (i+j) x = nest i (nest j x) nest 0 x = x -- nest distributes through concatenation nest i (x <> y) = nest i x <> nest i y nest i nil = nil -- nest is absorbed by text nest i (text s) = text s

 Here's an image to see what I'm talking about: https://ibb.co/wzxN7gm

 Chemacs2 uses its own functions to set the environment variable DOOMDIR
 ( ("vanilla" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/emacsen/vanilla/emacs.d"))) ("doom1" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/emacsen/doom1/emacs.d") (env. (("DOOMDIR"."~/emacsen/doom1/doom.d"))))) ("doom2" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/emacsen/doom2/emacs.d") (env. (("DOOMDIR"."~/emacsen/doom2/doom.d"))))) ) 
 Is it possible to use something like that to extend the PATH, ie ~/emacsen/doom2/doom.d/bin/doom?
 One way I can think of is run emacs with a script that adds the configurations bin/doom before calling emacs, but I prefer it do it in the manner Chemacs2 sets the DOOMDIR, within an Elisp configuration script.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a package called binary-instances providing Binary instances for various commonly used types like vectors and aeson Value but I couldn't find an analogous package for cereal.
 I prefer cereal over binary because the Double encoding in cereal makes sense, but cereal is lacking quite a few things that binary has, such as instances for Scientific. The lack of instances from packages can be quite an obstacle to consistently using cereal.
 Is there a package for cereal providing instances for Scientific? I couldn't find one. I'm wondering whether to write a package cereal-instances similar to binary-instances. It would be my first Hackage package. I'm wondering whether people will find it useful and whether I would end up semi-plagiarizing binary-instances since the code is probably very simple and similar to the one in binary-instances.

 I wanted a tool to discover and explore new code bases inside emacs. While I was looking for this tool, I saw some pictures of ranger and I really liked the layout. I wanted that kind of layout for emacs.
 So I wrote bfs :)
 ​
 BFS - by Tony Aldon
 bfs (Browse File System) implements for emacs a dynamic tree view of the file system à la ranger.
 This is a new "environment" accessible via the command bfs.
 I hope you will like it.
 ---> https://github.com/tonyaldon/bfs
 ps: As I said in the README:
  
bfs doesn't try to implement the features offered by ranger (only the layout),
 bfs isn't a file manager (I personaly still use dired, wdired and any shell for more elaborated tasks applying to files).

 Think projects as verticals and such infrastructure tasks as horizontals.

 The horizontal infrastructure may or may not have progress cookies that are per affected project.

 I know TODO dependencies use org-edna. so was wondering if i also need to use another package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello community,
 Do you have suggestions on state of the art libraries or frameworks to parse huge XML files? Alternatively, what's the best approach in tackling this problem with Scala?
 ​
 Disclaimer: I don't have a CS or IT background and have very little experience with pure Scala, I mostly use Spark and Python daily, but I wanted to start filling my skills gaps within the data engineering realm for a long-term goal. I think I know the difference between SAX and DOM parsing, so I was looking for something to implement the former (amirite? :D)
 ​
 Disclaimer 2: this question stems from an interview assignment that required something like this plus other features (streaming solution, JSON output), but after spending too much time just on learning the different parsing approaches I told them I wouldn't proceed: even though it's something easy for the average programmer, it clearly shows my huge gaps in knowledge and programming skills. But I still want to work on it in my own time.
 ​
 Thanks a lot in advance and sorry if it's a silly question. Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working off of a few blog posts as well as the org-manual, and I can't help but feel like I'm almost there.
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("d" "Daily agenda and all TODOs" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 4)(org-agenda-tag-filter-preset (quote (""))))) (alltodo "" ((org-agenda-tag-filter-preset (quote ("-habit"))) (org-agenda-compact-blocks t) )))))) 
 The code should show me four days of schedule plus whatever TODOs I have lying around that aren't scheduled (showing both means this post doesn't really tell me what I'm doing wrong). But it either fully excludes the Habit tag (which is sometimes used for recurring/upkeep style tasks, like mopping the kitchen floor, and that "sometimes-but-not-always" nature of them excludes this post) or the command fully includes it, with no middle ground. I had hoped that setting the filter preset for each phase individually would prevent this (by making it have no filter for the agenda, and then a filter for the todos) but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.
 The code as listed filters out habit from both agenda and todo. If I remove "-habit" from the second instance of filter, it shows habits in both places. It does feel like the filter preset is only being checked once, but I'm honestly in way over my head already and at a loss for how to fix it.

Inevitably, these will be proprietary frameworks, and I haven't spent a lot of time exploring them or figuring out how they work, but all this hype makes me wonder: How do these frameworks relate to Haskell?
 For me, I love Haskell because of it's huge potential for abstraction. And at least a lot of the time, abstraction means less, and more concise code. So, in many ways, I'd like to say that many Haskell libraries are actually "Low code" frameworks -- I think postgREST might be a perfect example of this. You generate a whole, possibly very complex API (which would be a lot of work by hand) with just a bit of SQL. Heck, throw in some entity-relationship diagrams instead of raw S…]]></summary>

Im quite happy and have basically all I need (you never have all you need but being realistic here). However I would really like to have a helper like in doom emacs, when I press my leader or even normal prefix keybinds I got a popup buffer telling me my options and that was really helpful to remember old or not so often used commands. Right now I think I don't have too many struggles but that's probably because Ive just made the file and have all the keybinds set up and read all the documentation of dozens of packages, if I ever dont use a leybind but remember vaguely how it starts, it would be awesome not to use some find functions or scouting my emacs file and or package files for the answer. 
 Sorry for slightly over explaining, help would be appreciated, thanks for your time.

great
benefits,
but comes with costs.
One of the most visible cost of laziness is hard to predict memory behavior, and so we
have, and need, tools to profile and measure the heap of our Haskell programs.
Most of the time, we live in a high-level world of type classes, monoids, and
isomorphisms. But at the end of the day our code needs to run on actual
machines, and when our code is run it needs to be performant. Typically, “be
performant”, means “have reasonable computational complexity” and so we usually
focus on good asymptotic behavior instead of constant costs. But when our
programs meet our CPUs, constant costs are important, and thus having low level
tools is helpful for low level optimizations, i.e., when you want to squeeze

 I am new to Emacs and have used it in the past few months mainly for VHDL coding. It had these wonderful shutter and electric modes which auto-filled the VHDL syntax making it easy for me to code (I was new to VHDL and emacs saved me).
 I have been using python for a few years now and wanted to enjoy some fun python coding on emacs. I mainly use libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib (pylab), pytorch and so on. I would really like to find a shutter-mode equivalent kind of mode for python. However, I am not sure of what to use since google had so many options and none of them very widely recommended. 
 So I would like you guys to help with some mode/add-on that would help me auto-fill the functions from these libraries and also any cool thing that would make my python coding with emacs fun!!

That is to say, I'm generally in the dark about Haskell package install. I did a stack ghci --package diagrams which seemed finally to install diagrams (after nine stack.yaml extra-deps additions) and start up a REPL (8.10.4). IAC, I could get the basic starter code DiagramsTutorial.lhs to load from the ghci prompt -- after doing :set -package diagrams-lib and :set -package diagrams-svg as it errored on Could not load module ‘Diagrams.Prelude’ etc. All right, then I tried as the tutorial says, i.e., $ ghc --make DiagramsTutorial.lhs This, however, errored out just like the ghci load with 
 diag1.hs:5:1: error: Could not load module ‘Diagrams.Prelude’ It is a member of the hidden package ‘diagrams-lib-1.4.3’. You can run ‘:set -package diagrams-lib’ to expose it. (Note: this unloads all the modules in the current scope.) Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. 
 and same for import Diagrams.Backend.SVG.CmdLine I'm confused over the whole stack versus cabal thing in general. BTW, what's the most popular IDE for Haskell? I've been using Emacs, trying to use the org-mode babel depending on a REPL session, which is iffy at best. Also, a $ ghc --version says 8.8.4. I'm confused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using Stack for long time and never gave Cabal a try because I read a while ago, when starting with Haskell, that Cabal is more complicated and can get me into problems like dependency hell and similar. Also, there was a compelling benefit of Stack handling ghc for me.
 However, recently I got more into learning about cabal due to trying to publish a library on Hackage and having to better understand what a cabal package actually is and how to determine version bounds for my library, for its dependencies.
 As a result I decided to write a small article that gives overview of what Cabal and Stack are and also compares them, based on what I learned: https://github.com/wasp-lang/haskell-handbook/blob/master/cabal-and-stack.md . I focused a lot on comparing Cabal with other package managers out there.
 I would love to hear if I got something wrong in it, or if I missed something - any feedback is very welcome!
 Article is aimed for Haskell beginners, but assumes they already had some experience with other programming languages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last two-three days, I have been trying to wrap my head around functional reactive programming. I came across threepenny-gui while I have been trying to understand the concept.
 My understanding is that the difference between reactive programming as opposed to event-driven programming is that in reactive programming, one describes the behavior of the UI as a time varying function rather than how it behaves when certain events are triggerred. For example, Spreadsheet allow for reactive programming since we can say that a certain cell is related to some other cell in terms of a certain formula -- instead of having to say [When those cells update, change this cell according to this formula]. 
 When I look at the different examples included with threepenny-gui, I get the impression that they have not designed their programs reactively. For instance, if you see Mouse.hs, you see that they are saying
  on UI.mousemove wrap $ \xy -> element out # set text ("Coordinates: " ++ show xy) on UI.keydown wrap $ \c -> element out # set text ("Keycode: " ++ show c) 
 which binds the \c -> element out # set text ... handler to the events. This looks like event driven programming to me, instead of reactive programming. In a reactive program, one would just say that certain fields are bound to the coordinates of the mouse.
 I have also looked at Reactive.Threepenny and I think I understand the combinators but I do not understand how to use them to actually write reactive code.
 Is my understanding correct?
 If you have suggestions on how to phrase my code as reactively as possible in threpenny-gui, that would be welcome. If this is not the correct library for this sort of programming, what would be a good way to exemplify these ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes I want to create some one-off modes to control more of my day-to-day tasks from emacs. Elisp is fun enough to code in, however one thing I find somewhat daunting is putting things into a buffer so that it looks nice.
 I am sure there must be some higher level "widget" or tui libraries out there that speed up that process without fiddling with manual placement of text and text properties, faces etc. I would really love to collect together some libraries here that you know. I couldn't find another comprehensive resource for this.
 To make a start, here are some I'm aware of:
  
magit-section: Create a ui like magit
 Taxy: Uses magit-section but in some cases makes it even more convenient and fast to put data into a buffer
 Tabulated List Mode: Not to forget the built-ins, tabulated list mode can also help setting up a buffer really fast if a tabulated list is all one needs
 Hierarchy: Put hierarchical data into a buffer with several convenience functions to display, query and action callbacks. Seems to be merged to emacs and even though the library is there, there is not documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals, so the git repo README is still useful for documentation.
 tree-widget.el: There seems to be a tree-widget.el in emacs core, seems this also can be used to build trees in buffers but I haven't used it and there seems to be no documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals about it so I don't really know how useful it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are trying to get a working Haskell dev environment on MacOS M1, and are having various problems with the different approaches we have taken.
 Our project currently uses an older nixpkgs that comes with ghc[js]-8.6.5, but this unsurprisingly does not work and is likely a wontfix.
 The obvious choice was upgrading nixpkgs to a new version. However it seems like entering a nix-shell with ghc does not work, even for a very simple project. It complains about a broken compiler-rt-libc, and allowing for broken packages leads to a failing build of compiler-rt-libc.
 Surprisingly nix-build does work for ghc, however our project is too large for nix-build to be practical for development, as build times are on the order of an hour.
 Another problem with newer nixpkgs is that ghcjs doesn't work at all, again even on simple projects. It errors out with a complaint about the happy test suite failing.
 Yet one more problem is that while newer ghcjs on non-M1 MacOS does work, it is massively slower, taking on the order of a day to build our project, occasionally requiring restarts due to running out of file handles.
 There are also problems with running newer ghcjs versions on Ubuntu, as our project deterministically fails with an Data.Binary.Get.runGet at position 0: not enough bytes error.
 Due to the above we have been instead focusing on getting ghc-8.6.5 working on MacOS M1 without nix via Rosetta.
 However this has been very difficult due to C dependencies. We have uninstalled and reinstalled the necessary brew libraries in x86 arch mode, but cabal does not seem to be able to find them either way.
 So what I was more or less wondering was what other people have gotten working on MacOS M1, in case there is anything we can learn from that to get our project building on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[org-depend is nice, but it feels clunky to me - I use org-capture to add tasks to my to-do list whenever they occur to me, so I often end up with something like:
 * TODO Task 1 * WAIT Task 2 * WAIT Task 1.5 
 ...where I forgot there was a task that needed to be done between 1 and 2, and have to add it in later. In this situation, the "chain-siblings" trigger keyword to move tasks from "WAIT" to "TODO" doesn't really work out - plus, what about situations where Task 1 is a blocker for multiple other tasks, not all of which need to be completed in sequence?
 The trigger that works based on IDs seems more generally useful, but also even less ergonomic. If you want Task 1.5 to be enabled automatically after Task 1 is done, you have to create a UUID for 1.5, copy it, navigate to Task 1, and create a trigger property for it with the copied UUID value - which would certainly be a pain in the ass to do from e.g. the agenda.
 Something like org-linker-edna would be nice, but its functionality is tied pretty closely to Helm (I'm an Ivy user). Is ergonomic dependency creation (that is, with completion) something I'm gonna have to script up myself, or are there existing developments in this space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going kinda crazy trying to understand what's going on here...
 Do org blocks allow TAB indentation without going into special editing mode via C-c ' ?
 I have the following relevant settings in my custom-set-variables block (i.e. edited via customize-mode.
  '(org-edit-src-content-indentation 0) '(org-src-preserve-indentation nil) 
 I used these settings because I was getting sick of editing code in the source block and having all the lines jump 2 spaces to the right.
 org-src-tab-acts-natively is set to t as well. 
 But now when I write
 #+begin_src python def hello(): | #+end_src 
 the cursor is stuck at the start of the line and I can't use TAB to indent to add a new line, i.e. to make it look like:
 def hello( ): print("hello) 
 TAB used to work -- or atleast, I thought it was working. This github comment suggests that this facility was never actually available, and we always had to use C-c ' to edit code properly.
 Now, I have also set org-adapt-indentation to nil, because I prefer org-headings, sub-headings and text to be aligned with the buffer edge. If I set it to 1, it looks like there is some aligning going on when I hit TAB, but this is not perfect. Does this explain the "pseudo-indenting" that I had before, and there really is no inherent TAB indent in org blocks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started learning Common Lisp, mostly because there is a university class I could take in the future in which they just assume you already know the language going in; and so I downloaded the Portacle IDE, which is a bundle of (a forked version of?) Emacs, SBCL, QuickLisp, and Git. 
 Currently, I am only using Emacs for my rudimentary Lisp programming, because I don't quite understand how to use Emacs properly. To put it into perspective, I find the much maligned text editor Vim far easier to use than Emacs, even though I had never really used the terminal in such a involved manner before I started programming with Vim. 
 If I decided to download the "regular" version of Emacs to use for every programming language I know later in time, would that interfere with Portacle's version of Emacs?

But I am still fairly new to both web development and Haskell as a language, so it'd be great to have somebody on a similar level of knowledge to talk things through and help each other.
 We would work on a project from scratch (doesn't really matter what, it's just to practice and learn) for about one or two hours a day until we're satisfied with how much we've learned. We can do it in either English or Spanish (my native language)
 So, I'm sending this to the universe, hoping there's someone in a similar position to me... Just write here in the comments or DM me.
 Thanks for reading, and happy hacking!!

 I want to have something like
 (add-roam-node-hook "Writing" "1:M" #'(auto-fill-mode electric-quote-mode zen-mode ...) 
 Basically have the hooks run after nodes that have a backlink to writing. This way I can completely have certain experiences for certain nodes in relation to others.

 I'm also thinking of doing a mode just wanted some insight on the easiest path if something exists already

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This small package essentially provides glue code between org-odt-convert and org-table-convert-region, enabling one to open a spreadsheet file (e.g., xlsx, ods) or a text-delimited file (e.g., csv) in a special buffer, edit it with org-table- and orgtbl- commands, and then save it back to the original file in its original format.
 https://github.com/shankar2k/orgtbl-edit
 I made this package because I often find myself wanting to make small edits to CSV files that would be very convenient to do with org-table- commands (e.g., shift a column left or right), but I don't want to deal with the overhead every time of importing the file, converting it to Org, and then exporting back to the same file format.
 Because a picture is worth a thousand words, here is an example XLSX file:
 An example XLSX file.
 And here is the same file when opened in Emacs using orgtbl-edit:

 One thing to note is that for spreadsheet files, because this currently uses CSV as an intermediate format, when saving back to the original file, all formatting and formulas will be lost. 
 I hope some of you find this useful!

 I should specify: using the terminal, sending mail with msmtp/sendmail works well with multiple accounts. The problem is with emacs itself not using it correctly... Or something?
 If you use this setup, how do you do specify the account you want to use to send the mail? Is there a configuration that makes this work?
 (I tried just editing the field in the compose window, but that doesn't work)
 Don't know where else to ask, seems like a good place. Couldn't find any good resource online.

 If we treat this as definitive:

 ​
 Haskell is about 33% more concise than Python, and 85% more concise than C++ / Java. It's less concise than Coffeescript by about 22%. However, this resource is sort of obsolete, and SLOC is not necessarily a good metric (it doesn't consider how many elements exist on one line).

Integrated support for ivy-erlang-complete and company-erlang to work on Erlang code without an Erlang node while having full auto-completion and cross-reference navigation across Erlang project and the Erlang library.
 Support for EDTS
 Support for LSP via lsp-mode and erlang-ls
  
PEL attempts to unify the use of several commands. For instance you can use the M-. key for cross-refernce navigation with any of the supported cross reference packages that work with Erlang. You select the package you want to use via customization and that's what PEL uses by default, mapping the command to the M-. key. During an editing session you can…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently on ChromeOS 96.0.4664.25 (Official Build) beta (64-bit). After the most recent update (to this current version of ChromeOS), my emacs GUI appears garbled. The menus, text, etc. just leaves black marks and fonts appear one over the other!
 However, the emacs in terminal works fine.
 Has anyone using emacs on ChromeOS faced this issue? 
 I am not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I am also not sure if I should be asking this is the chromeOS subreddit.

 I'm trying to write basic functions like get an Integer-list as input and apply some function, nothing complicated. But I fail to find anything usable, that helps me doing this. I just want to instantly know when I write total garbage. For example if my functions have the wrong type, etc.
 I'm currently trying to tweak atom with ide-haskell, but I only get default syntax highlighting of keywords. When I run ghci my_program.hs I get shitloads of errors because my functions are not even syntactically right. Is it possible to get these errors in the IDE while typing (like in any other language)?
 Is this all that I can get from this plugin, or am I missing something?

 I also get that if I make those operations non-blocking, I'm no longer limited in this way: I give an operation to a thread, it kicks it off, and then it's free for more work.
 What I don't get is how this is so. Is the thread handing the operation off to the os and saying "tell me when it's done"? If so, how does the os not get jammed up in the same way as our blocking/5-thread app? It seems like at some point there must be a thing that waits on the operation to complete.
 If it helps, here is an example of contrasting behavior: the first is async and parallel, the second blocking and parallel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! 
 I've started learning and practicing Scala less than a year ago for my current job, and so far I love it. I learned following the Coursera course from the wonderful Martin Odersky, but I quickly realised that my company was still in the middle of its transition from Java to Scala, with most of our code base looking more like scalaified Java than pure FP Scala like I learned at the beginning.
 I like functional programming, I've liked it from the first moment I learned common Lisp even thou the language felt antiquated, and, well, I wouldn't say I cried, but I was somewhat moved by the....purety ? Mathematicality ? of scala ( don't judge, IK my sense of esthetic is somewhat weird ). 
 Things seem to be somewhat moving in this direction at work, and I wanted to accompany this, and satisfy my own curiosity, by learning the move fp-extremist stuff I could find in Scala. 
 I could easily find resources on cats and the rest of the typelevel ecosystem, but then I discovered ZIO and that became my latest obsession. I like the project, I like how ZIO code looks and what the whole obsessive typing of everything thingy brings to me as a Dev.
 And then I tried to learn Zio 2.0 ( because why start with the old one when the next one is almost there ? ) but I have a hard time finding learning resources.
 Which bring me to my question ( thanks for reading my life story if you did ) : is the Zionomicon, and Zio in general, worth the time and money I would invest ?
 
 TLDR : weirdo ranting on his new fp zealotry wants to know if paying 50+ bucks for the Zionomicon is worth it

 ​
 Gives an answer like this.
 My question is if i could zip the lists of a list, so that i could get [(0,0,0) (1,0,0) (2,0,0)] and so on.

This looked very useful but I can't find the package name or video anymore. Does this ring a bell for anyone? I believe the package was quite new.
 Bonus question, I'm looking to combine a weekly and daily entries automatically. I would like to have a list of todo's for the week, defined in my weekly entry, and display those at the top of my dailies automatically (creating the weekly if no exists yet). I don't want to use carry over in org-journal as that doesn't quite do what I'd like. I'm certain this could be achieved somehow 😃

 Hi there,
 I hope that the minibuffer prompts in emacs left bottom corner, such as M-x Find-file, which is produced by Function (minibuffer-prompt) defined in C source code, could be hidden/ disabled/ removed/ deleted.
 I have tried, but failed:
 (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda() (put 'minibuffer-prompt 'disable t)))
 (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda() (fmakunbound 'minibuffer-prompt)))
 Could somebody help? : (
 ​
 Update:
 It's done! Making selectrum + mini-frame + posframe pops up as company-mode does. Thanks _viz_ !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this doesn't make sense, but I'm struggling to find out how to express this question.
 Someone recently submitted a post or a comment about how they use use-package to configure all the packages they've installed in their init.el. I'm not sure exactly what I mean by all packages, I think I mean packages/settings that weren't installed using use-package ensure, or straight inside the use-package configuration, or maybe even that the packages weren't installed via MELPA, but by cloning a git repository. 
 In any case there was a comment that (briefly) explained how to configure the package setup and behavior using a use-package configuration; I thought I'd saved it but didn't, now I can't seem to find it. If anyone has any idea what I'm going on about, please let me know!
 EDIT: I believe what I was looking for was use-package emacs and storing Emacs settings like (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) there, as raised in this post, found by u/graduale and u/scbagley. From other comments, it sounds like you can also configure built-in packages like dired using use-package as well, so that's helpful. If you have any further thoughts on this, please feel free to add them!

        <updated>2021-10-31T20:04:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce my first library on Hackage, jordan. Jordan provides abstract and inspectable JSON parsing and serialization, using the Applicative (for parsing) and Divisible (for serializing) typeclasses.
 Jordan has you define ToJSON and FromJSON classes in terms of instructions, such as "serialize a string" or "parse an object with these fields". These instructions are then evaluated by various interpreters, which actually do the work of parsing or serializing. This has a few benefits:
  
Intermediate structures are entirely avoided: there is no Map.Map Text JSONValue anywhere in the library, and JSON fields are directly parsed using permutation parsers. This also means that we can always serialize a JSON directly to a bytestring, avoiding the need for anything like toEncoding from Aeson
 Since JSON interaction is kept abstract, you can generate documentation for parsers and serializers, directly from their definitions. This is provided in jordan-openapi.
 This library provides a fun excuse to use contravariant functors, so you can feel like a super small functional programmer
  
The github page for this project is located here. While I'm not gunning to replace Aeson or anything, I would really appreciate any feedback anybody has to offer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For comparison: Akka actors can manage mutable state without thread-safety concerns, since each actor will only only process one message at a time.
 Taking the principle to fibers, is there any thread-safety or practical problems with using mutable state inside fiber (think vars), as long as the state is not share with other fibers? I'm not talking about Refs, which use AtomicReferences under the hood. I'm talking about closing directly over mutable state, and reading and writing to it as required on a per-fiber basis.
 An example of this may be the re-use of buffer: Array[Byte] in this part of the Cats Effect tutorial.

 make sure that epg-pinentry-mode is set to 'loopback in emacs

 Is it also true that if sptr is the static pointer of created in module M and I add some unrelated entries in M (the same module) the static pointer sptr does not change ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[data Set obj = Sphere { radius :: Int, color :: String } 
 Is it possible to retrieve all the contents of "Sphere"?
 I am trying to retrieve the contents through an external function which I make like this:
 SphereData :: obj -> [] SphereData (...) 
 I am pretty new to Haskell and have been looking around on the internet for a solution, but none have had the specific "problem" that I have.
 ​
 I could maybe use pattern matching. In my head this is the best bet I have, but that won't work, because "obj" is given and based on the pattern match either an Int or String is returned. In no way or shape can I return all the "properties" of this Set.
 ​
 Any ideas, tips, tricks?

 I was watching this great talk on Reproducible Research by Thibault Lestang, demonstrating the power of Org Babel. His org file is here:
 https://github.com/tlestang/org-mode-reproducible-research/blob/main/org-mode-examples/RR.org
 The initial C++ code block works great to produce the array initial_data, but the subsequent python code block to plot the array doesn't work:
 #+header: :var timeseries=initial_data :results file :dir "./figures/" #+begin_src python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt timeseries = np.array(timeseries) plt.plot(timeseries[:,0], timeseries[:,1]) plt.savefig("timeseries_vis.png") return "timeseries_vis.png" #+end_src #+RESULTS: [[file:figures/timeseries_vis.png]] 
 If I run the above I get: 
 #+RESULTS: file:figures 
 and no actual png output file is produced. If I run the block in :session mode that gives me IndentationError: Unexpected Indent. If I remove the indents and re-run I get SyntaxError: return outside function. I can get rid of this error by re-writing it as a function, and it then works. But I'd really like to know what is wrong with the original code, and how can I run it without :session? 
 Many thanks!

 I have browsed the dired chapter on emacs manual, but have not found how to do something very simple: preview file contents like with ranger. With ranger I can move up or down over a list of files with arrows, and I can preview their contents at the side, regardless of the content being simple text, image, pdf, etc. How can I do the same with emacs? I saw a video of someone doing that with Doom Emacs, however I am not keen on using Doom or similar packages, I prefer to have a simple init.el that I can understand.

 I've attempted sortBy and sortOn, but I failed.

There is a lot of examples in our systems: activities are related to ranges of dates and time in job planning, filters with intervals in online shop, etc. Scala's standard library provides the great collections framework. But it implements ordinary sets and maps, for ordered ones there is no such thing (upd: i'm sorry for some confusion with terminology, please see comment).

 Morton Ordering
 If you have multidimensional data and interleave the binary representation of each key, you get a neat space-filling curve called a z-order curve. Ed wrote a series about using them to do sparse matrix multiplication.
 I've also seen them used when you need to crunch multidimensional keys into a single dimension e.g., when you need to be able to use a DynamoDB sort key to search across multiple dimensions.

 From the command line command with time gives me the time used even if it is not so precise.
 Do Unices have some similar utility for finding the maximum memory usage of any script at all?

 That said, I would really really like a way to integrate org-mode functionality on my Nextcloud server. So I was wondering if it's possible to compile emacs to WASM.
 The biggest problem I foresee, as far as usability goes, is that the browser would swallow/usurp/hijack many of the default emacs key chords. For evil users, this is not such a problem, :-) , but not everyone is evil.

However, the name conflict between lense and traditional field selectors makes it a bit awkward to use : you either go full lenses or at all. Mix and match doesn't really work.
 Also having to rely on TH induces some problems, and type errors can get overly complicated.
 I basically given up on them (the only real use being nested update which are kind of rare, and should be solved soon within GHC).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am still evaluating the idea but the goal is to enjoy flutter cross platform UIs with the purity and clarity of ps for my next startup beginning from January. Dart is not terrible, but I always miss the ML types and abstractions, and very specially the strict purity.
 I see there are many backends out there, and dart supports many purescript data types (with some lack). Also not sure how to deal with the mutable aspects of dart in the purescript side.
 If this is a feasible work to do under two months I would give it a try and ask for some help in order to build a robust open source backend with the goal of becoming a real ASAP.
 Is there any information relative to making new backends including standardized tests? Is there anyone interested willing to contribute?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I encounter some font spacing problems on macOS when I switch my font from time to time: especially when the default font :weight 'light is used, something about bold constructs throws whitespace off, of all things -- the space character is rendered a bit too wide, then.
 (defun ct/use-face (font weight height) (let ((the-font (format "%s-%d:%s" font height weight))) (message the-font) (setq default-frame-alist (append (list `(font . ,the-font) '(min-height . 1) '(height . 45) '(min-width . 1) '(width . 101) '(vertical-scroll-bars . nil) '(internal-border-width . 24) ;; frame padding around the text '(left-fringe . 0) '(right-fringe . 0) '(tool-bar-lines . 0))))) (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font font :height (* height 10) :weight weight) (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font font :height (* height 10) :weight weight)) (defun ct/use-medium-face () "Use Roboto Medium 18pt, for smaller screens" (interactive) (ct/use-face "Roboto Mono" 'medium 18) (setq-default line-spacing .2)) (defun ct/use-regular-face () "Use Roboto Light 22pt, for larger screens." (interactive) (ct/use-face "Roboto Mono" 'light 22) (setq-default line-spacing .3)) 
 I would love to replace this manual font switching, which might be broken, with something more robust that ideally adjusts to the frame size.
 Use case
 I'm switching from my MacBook's 13" Retina display on the go to a 1440p ultra-wide at my desk, and enjoy different font settings for each. The desk's monitor is further away from my face and I use the 22pt font setting for most of the time there. That's way too big for the built-in laptop screen, though, so I use the 18pt font variant there.
 Do you know of any well-tested package that supports changing font sizes (and weights) to make the best use of a frame's size given the circumstances?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Zettelnauts,
now that a major leap forward (for me) is done with the second edition (the beta phase in German begins soon and after that I will attack the English translation), I am turning my eyes on more specialised applications.
The development of the second books so far was driven by beginning with Luhmann as the core idea and unfold it with the help of philosophy of science. So, I deem the foundation to be layed out.
The next two branches that start to grow (in my Zettelkasten first) are:
Specialised applications of the Zettelkasten
Thinking tools that work within the frame work of the Zettelkasten Method. Cognitive Mapping is an example. (Big shoutout to u/thomasteepe for the term Integrated Thinking Environment (originally Integrated Thought Development Environment))
The first aspect is now what I am preparing in my Zettelkasten. So, I want to ask you if I forgot an important user case. In my Zettelkasten, I have the following:
Students
Teachers (Mostly geared towards the German Schools System at the moment)
Bloggers
Visual Artists
Fiction Writers
Non-Fiction Writers
Lawers and judges
Theologicans (and studying the bible)
Scientists
Humanities
Non-Scientists (~private use like dog training, cooking, hobbies, child upbringing etc.)
Anything missing?
Live long and prosper

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs has cooperative threading which AFAIK does not prevent a badly behaving thread locking up the UI. Since real multithreading is hard to add to Emacs could forking support alleviate this? 
 So unlike emacs-async which starts with a fresh emacs, you could create from lisp a copy of the current process with all the settings, variables, etc. being the same, so, for example, a lisp autocompletion library could use fork to spin up an other process and calculate the possible completions of the current position, returning these asynchronously to the parent process thereby not interfering with UI updates.
 I know creating processes is more costly than creating threads, but with today's computers it may be still fast enough to produce asynchronous results for completion, etc. without blocking the UI thread.
 Forking is supported by all major OSs, so could this be a good enough solution for async processing?

Oh my! It all blows up in our face! If there’s no monster, it doesn’t have 
 a head. When using head, tail, last and init, be careful not to use themempty lists. This error cannot be caught at compile time so it’s always good 
 practice to take precautions against accidentally telling Haskell to give you

In Python I would do something like:

I've used emacs for 20 years but never managed to discover org mode until a month ago. Ever since then I've been reading everything I can get my hands on to better master this tool. I've found a couple of tutorials, guides, docs, and walk throughs but to a person new to all this, it can be a bit overwhelming. So, to help the next new guy who comes here I'm posting my org configuration complete with comments. 
 I doubt most people will use org anything like what I need to use it for, however this configuration shows you how to configure a lo of things that might not immediately be obvious and will hopefully serve as a good foundation for building your own work flow.

This function has :override advice: selectrum-completing-read-multiple. Read multiple strings in the minibuffer, with completion. The arguments are the same as those of completing-read. [.etc.] 
 I know that the "outermost" :override wins over the "innermost", and if they are at the same depth then the last one to be added wins. But how I can see what depth they have and in what order they were added?
 Based on my init.el and package sources I suspect that in my case they are at the same level and the consult-* function was provided as advice second. But how can I be sure? I couldn't find a way to inspect the details of a function's advice with a look through the elisp manual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generators in Haskell can either take the form of lazy lists or some generator library.
 Lazy lists are wonderful to work with, but may be hard to create for some sequences (such as those which require the use of mutable state to generate efficiently).
 Various generator libraries make it easier to generate such sequences, but the trade-off is that using them is typically more cumbersome. 
 Theoretically, one would be able to get the "best of both worlds" by converting a generator to a lazy list. Is there a good way to do so in Haskell? If so, what is it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, some quick background on me:
  
I am trying to get into Scala as I wish to work with Spark. I have good scripting knowledge in a few high-level languages (PowerShell mainly, plus Python and general Bash/awk scripting), and I'd like to break into a more rigorous programming paradigm. Another potential plus is that my company product is written in Java. I don't implement any code, but I do handle its technical implementation and design augmentations for customers. I may find an opportunity to leverage Scala in the JVM for some side projects to help me practice. 
 At any rate, my motivation for learning Scala is that it seems well-aligned with my goals and circumstances for entering a more programmatic world.
  
Books
 After looking around, I've picked out 3 books:
  
Programming in Scala Fifth Edition
 
Hands-on Scala Programming: Learn Scala in a Practical, Project-Based Way 
 
Programming Scala: Scalability = Functional Programming + Objects
 
 I saw a lot of good things about Programming in Scala Fourth Edition, and being that it's written by Martin Odersky, it seems like a solid choice. However, the Fifth Edition claims to have been overhauled for Scala 3, and it's too new for me to find any reviews on how this overhauled edition has turned out.
 Hands-on Scala Programming has good reviews and seems like it might be oriented toward a beginner specifically with its "project-based" approach. However being published in 2020, I'd expect it to have been written for Scala 2. I figured if I am jumping into Scala, I should go for a Scala 3 book.
 The book by Dean Wampler seems like a solid book, but I can't find much info on it in terms of reviews.
 Does anyone have experience with any of these books and could provide their 2 cents on it?
 Thank you!

 I can't seem to track down where this function should be defined. Is there something I should have installed but missed? I was surprised by this error.
 ​
 Anyways hope this helps someone else and if you have any ideas as to where this error originated I would love to know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm loving Org Mode, but every time I edit an org document, I get conflicted between editing for the org-file and latex output. In particular when it comes to newlines. I frequently use \\ when I want to start a newline in my LaTeX output, but don't want extra spacing. Is there a way to hide this symbol in org-mode? I find it visually quite distracting. I have hide-emphasis-markers activated, but this doesn't affect the \\ symbol. Any way to hide \\? 
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm trying to automate grading of Haskell assignments. I don't know whether the students have defined all of the functions I need to test. Thus, I'd like to run something
 ghci> try (map foo [1,2,3])
 rather than manually comb through submissions like
 ghci> map foo [1,2,3]
 <interactive>:1:5: error:
 Variable not in scope: foo :: Integer -> b
 I know shell/bash well enough to do this there, but it would be nice to be able to do it in Haskell. Is it possible?
 ​
 (edit to note that I'm not fluent in Haskell myself (I'm trying to just keep ahead of the students), and have been using Haskell From First Principles as a guide).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started reading about optics in haskell, and was wondering if any of the haskell optics libraries supports the concepts of alignment from the view update literature?
 Here is an example of what I want to do:
 Source (a): [ { name: "Patrick", age: 40, job: "Programmer" }, { name: "Jonathan", age 30, job: "Teacher" }, { name: "George", age: 20, job: "Office worker" } ] Target (b): [ { name: "Bob", job: "Policeman" },//person added { name: "George", job: "Office worker" }//Order changed, is now before Patrick { name: "Patrick", job: "Haskell Programmer" }//job changed //Jonathan removed ] Expected result (a): [ { name: "Bob", age: null, job: "Policeman" },//person added with default age { name: "George", age: 20, job: "Office worker" }, { name: "Patrick", age: 40, job: "Haskell Programmer" }//Job updated //Jonathan removed ] data Lens a b = Lens { get:: a -> b, put:: b -> a -> a } 
 How can I write the "put" function that takes "Source" and "Target" and returns "Expected result"? The put function must align the persons by name (key based alignment).

 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html , in which emacs daemon runs as soon i startup systemd.
 But i've found that just running "emacs" doesnt connect with that server, we have to put
 "emacsclient -nw" or "emacsclient --create-frame" for gui, in order to have as many as client but one server. i put in gnome, "emacs.desktop" to run that emacsclient gui. but it takes "2 seconds to load" , while normal emacs command loads in 0.6 second. with in that, It automatically closes when i dont touch it . I also tried to add 8.8.8.8 "emacs" on /etc/hosts but it doesnt works. 
 I think dont understand , about client and server on emacs, which is client or which is server and what should i put in order to run emacs client in that server. 
 I've taken reference to make .desktop put "emacsclient --create-frame" and run from 
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/31704/run-emacs-gui-from-emacsclient

 anybody please guide me,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically what the title says. 
 I've been using org-tree-slide, which works fine for simple presentations, but I'm looking for something slightly more elaborate while still working inside emacs (i.e. no org-reveal or beamer). Something that offers a few presentation commodities like simple animations and a little more control over slide appearance. 
 Is there such a package?
 ps: I've looked into org-present, but it seems to be even more bare-bones than org-tree-slide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 cgroup-rts-threads is a new library that solves a problem we experienced while running our haskell code in docker containers.
 In short, the GHC RTS -N flag will happily spawn threads exceeding a container's configured cpu limit, leading to drastically reduced performance.
 See the package README for details.
  
We'd be happy to accept contributions, including one to reduce the dependency footprint -- this code was previously part of a bigger codebase.
  
Somewhat relatedly, a quick plug: we're actively hiring for a haskeller to join our team (remote - US/Canada/Argentina) to work on our dependency analysis tool and associated backend components.
 This is the first package we've published, and we'd love to contribute some more. Come help us do that!

I do use doom emacs on my chromebook (so no issues with this there) but on my other systems, I simply use vanilla emacs.

 Any ideas what variable or settings may have caused this behavior? It was working as designed a couple of weeks ago. I recently got doom package running, but no change when I comment that out in the config.

 I tried clearing my straight cache and pulling a few more times, nothing seems to fix it. Looking at the elisp for org, the function org-in-archived-heading-p seems like its defined in org.el, so I'm confused as to why the symbol isn't being found.
 Has anyone else seen something like this?

the relevant .saves-[etc]~ file seems to only list unsaved files, so apparently if there were things I had had open but had saved they don't appear. Non-file buffers also don't seem to be listed.
 when i attempt to recover the session, it asks if I want to recover one of the six files listed, then seems to quit. Even when I press ! which the help tells me will 'recover all remaining files', it only reopens the one.

 I'm starting to accept the idea that I won't be able to get back to where I was last night, but is there a way to set up emacs so that it saves all aspects of a session, so that next time I can actually recover and get back all my frames, windows, tabs, and buffers after a forced (or even voluntary...) shutdown, not just a single unsaved file?
 And (Or?) how do I get it to at least recover the other files M-x recover session knows about but doesn't seem to be reaching?

 does anyone know of an open source project/web app/library, written in Haskell, that makes terminal interface accessible via browser?
 An example of what I'd like to achieve:
 Start R repl process withing a docker container on the backend (e.g. `docker run -it --rm rocker/r-base`) and allow user to interact with it using terminal-like interface from their browser (with stuff like TAB completion working etc.)
 It seems that xterm.js is a popular choice to implement the client side of such a thing,
 but I'm looking for some inspiration of how a backend of such an application could be implemented in Haskell.
 Examples in other languages that do similar thing to what I'd like:

 I wrote a strong-path package, which I published on Hackage. I am using Stack to build it: I have stack.yaml and package.yaml as sources of truth, while strong-path.cabal is generated by Stack but I also commit it into vcs.
 When I started developing strong-path, I haven't specified any dependency versions in package.yaml, since I knew it will pull whatever is provided by the Stack resolver I am using, and that worked fine for me.
 At some point I started needing the newer version of `path` package than the version that was present in the LTS resolver, so I added `path-0.9.0` und…]]></summary>

 votesCandidate :: [(String,(String,String,String))] -> String -> Int 
 and finally electionWinner, that knowing what each country voted and how many points each got, will tell you the winner
 electionWinner :: [(String,(String,String,String))] -> String 
 for example:

 I've been doing some type-programming lately, and realized the stuff I'm writing is significantly different than the world as it existed in 2018. We now have quantified constraints, HKDs, kind-generics, and all sorts of other cool techniques. 
 Since 2018, there have also been lots of other books! I haven't been great at keeping up --- but has anything superseded TwT? If so, there's probably not much reason in pushing out a new edition.
 But if there's sufficient interest, I'd be more than keen to put it together. Let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,I'm trying to create a "visit_count_file" property for each org file I have. The code I'm doing should:
  
create the property value equal to 1 if it's not here yet
 increments the property value each time you open the file
  
Here is what I came up with for now
 (defun lkr/increment-visit-count () "increments the 'file_visit_count' property +=1" (interactive) (org-entry-put 0 "file_visit_count" (number-to-string (+ (string-to-number (org-entry-get 0 "file_visit_count")) 1)))) (defun lkr/update-visit-count () "creates or increments the 'file_visit_count' property" (if (org-entry-get 0 "file_visit_count") (lkr/increment-visit-count) (org-entry-put 0 "file_visit_count" "1"))) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'lkr/visit-count-update) 
 the problem is that it creates the property value in the first heading of the file if the heading is in the first line, and create the property at the top of the file otherwise. How can I do to always put the property at the top of the file?
 behavior:
 ​
 * first heading :PROPERTIES: :file_visit_count: 1 :END: 
 wanted behavior:
 :PROPERTIES: :file_visit_count: 1 :END: * first heading 
 I just started to fiddle with org mode and emacs lisp so I'm not very good at it. Thanks for reading.
 Bonus question:would it be easy to do the same but instead of putting it in a property drawer, putting it in
 #+visit_count_file: 1 * first heading 
 like this? what would be better in your opinion?Thank you again.

Ability to subscribe to multiple calenders (via ics urls).
 Ability to have multiple calenders (like in Google, for example, I have one for work and one for personal events).
 Ability to create, delete and edit events.
 Ability to sync calendars with Google calendars (and Microsoft calendars if possible), so I can check events on my phone.
  
I imagine that these requirements are shared by others, so there must be a way to satisfy all of them. I just couldn't find it.
 Does anyone have a working setup for calendars that they can share?

 Edit: This seems to only be occurring on Windows. I just tried it on Debian and there's no issue. I've read that this has something to do with a Let's Encrypt certificate expiration, but have not found an immediate fix.
 Trying gpg --homedir ~/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg --receive-keys 066DAFCB81E42C40 as one answer from SO suggested does not work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep all my Org files in a Git repo, so the archiweirdval feature feels a bit redundant -- though I keep using it, because C-c $ / $ (in the agenda) is so convenient.
 There's tons of .org_archive files littered around my repo, and if I complete two different tasks on different machines, I get merge conflicts in the archive files. I think I'd rather just have it delete the entries and use Git in the unlikely even that I need to dig through the archives -- I think it's happened maybe two or three times in the 12 years (yikes!) I've been using Org Mode.
 I guess the only thing I'd be missing is explicitly recording TODO completion. If I just delete the TODO, it could have been done and closed, or unnecessary and not done. I'm definitely not going to change state, commit, delete, commit -- I think I can live with that loss for a cleaner repo.
 Is there a thing that makes archival work better with Git repos? What are y'all doing for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a task that I've done using some Emacs and some command line tools (sort and cut), but it's slow and error prone and I reckon I could do it all in Emacs, but I don't quite know how.
 ​
 Please help me learn how to write some elisp to solve this...
 ​
 My problem:
  
I want to sort lines in a file based on a date string in the line itself.
 For simplicity: 
 There are two types of lines, but the structure is consistent within a type.
 type A might be: INSERT INTO tableA VALUES (something, something, '2021-11-11 11:11:11.111+00', something);
 type B might be: INSERT INTO tableB VALUES (something, '1999-12-31 01:01:01.001+00', something, '2021-11-11 22:22:22.222+00', something, something);
 I want the second date string in type B
 
 So based on seeing uniqueA or uniqueB in the string I know where(ish) the date string is
 Naturally, each line has different data for the something values and different date-time strings.
 There is a chance that the "line" may actually be broken with new-lines in the text, so what I know is that it starts with INSERT INTO and ends with );\n
  
​
 What I've done
  
Emacs: Define keyboard macro to search for tableA, then isearch-regex-forward for ..-..- to get my date string, copy that string, move to the start of the line, paste with a following space. C-u to apply lots of times, iterate until I have done all the lines
 Emacs: Define keyboard macro to search for tableB, then blah-blah-blah paste date at start of line with a following space. C-u to apply lots of times, iterate until I've done all the lines
 Jump back to my shell. sort the file, cut -f3- -d' ' the file and then I have my sorted file.
  
(I tried working out how to do the Emacs part in sed, but failed to see a useful example online...)
 ​
 This approach is complicated and error prone and not very reproducible.
 How would you go about it in Emacs?

In 2018, most options did not completely cut it for me, due to e.g. only formatting certain parts of the source file or having many unfortunate bugs. Upon discovering Ormolu in 2019, I was first appalled by its style, but this reaction was only short-lived, as I found these stylistic preferences to be easily malleable via familiarisation.
I started using Ormolu for all personal projects, and submitted bug reports and minor pull requests. Therefore, an internship to work on Ormolu full-time came like a call!

Because of the size of our stack we use a variety of languages, to choose the most appropriate tech at each level of the stack. We use Haskell, SQL, and Rust, with a splash of C and Python where it makes sense.
 Quick Facts:
  
This is a remote position. If you prefer an office environment and live in or are willing to relocate to Toronto that works for us.
 We are looking for a mid/senior level hire. We love to hire junior candidates with great promise, but at this point the team isn't yet large enough to share the training effort.
 The working hours for this position are in Toronto local time (ET)
 Authorized to work in US/CA is a slam dunk. Other countries are possible but we may need to do some investigation before we promise we can make it happen.

 This works (which is good), but it only grows the window by one character width, so I'd like to be able to use "." to repeat it. However, this command does not appear in the ring for some reason, so whatever was used before :ewh is what ends up repeated.
 How can I use this alias/command I want while also having calls appear in the ring so they are eligible for repetition by "."?
 Unfortunately, prefacing the command with a number like :5ewh does enlarge the window by five characters, but it also moves me to line 5. This approach would also be okay if it didn't navigate to a new line.
 Thanks!

My question is that, I use lsp-java but I guess it is effective with just springboot projects. But Im using various frameworks. How can I configure my Emacs as Java IDE as well. And debugging part is important for me. I'm dealing problems for configuring spring debugger. I also listen your ideas.

What's the best way to do Vue-style components and applications, but using Purescript instead of Typescript?
 I'm using Jest + Stryker to do (property-based, mutation) testing. Should I use them with Purescript (how?) or switch to some other testing framework?
  
I'm quite comfortable with Haskell, and I have an existing Vue.js + Typescript application that I wrote (and host at https://iguanasuicide.net/) but I'm not really comfortable with npm / node / vue -- there's no specification I can read ala the Haskell Report so I'm always uncertain when editing the configuration. I'm even uncertain on the latest Typescript changes -- I learned it from the specification that is no longer updated.

 I'm on a mac, and testing this on a prebuilt Emacs 26 from homebrew, and emacs 28.0.60 I compiled. It seems that in my v28.0.60 if I open a tramp connection to a remote server that is behind a VPN, if the VPN connection is killed, emacs completely freezes. (to test, I just open a dired remote directory, and sever the connection. Instant beachballing.) I've tried setting tramp verbose mode to 10 and sending SIGUSR2, but am having trouble getting useful information (for me). Once the freezing happens, I can't recover and its becoming extremely frustrating. SIGUSR2 can at least let me get back into emacs, but in a debug mode. The only message I could see was about a premature ending and Forbiddent reentrant tramp. (I don't have the exact messages right now, but could get them.)
 I do have a copy of my v26 emacs, and it does not have the same problem. When the VPN/remote connection is killed, emacs locks up for a few seconds, before it simply times out, and I can keep going. Annoying, but not a show-stopper.
 In each case, I am starting with emacs -Q option and the only extra command I'm using before opening files is ido-mode.
 I did stumble on  this issue  which mentions that start-file-process-shell-command was changed between v26 and v28. Is what I am noticing something related to that?
 The behavior is very different between versions on the same computer (and ssh configuration), and I am loading things with the "-Q" option for no init file. Any pointers to how to track this down would be helpful. Did I compile without some magic flag in the configuration that was needed?

 type family Last ts :: * where Last '[t] = t Last (t ': ts) = Last ts 
 When using the type family as part of a program, I'm encountering an error as follows (summarised):
 Could not deduce: Last ts1 ~ Last (t : ts1) from the context: ts ~ (t : ts1) NB: `Last' is a non-injective type family 
 From my understanding, the last type in the list ts1 must be identical to the last type in the list t : ts1, the presence of an extra item at the beginning should not have an effect on which item is at the end. Therefore, Last ts1 should be the same as Last (t : ts1), but GHC cannot guarantee this.
 What changes can I make to get my code to compile?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I apologize for this question but I have been trying this for a while and getting a bit stuck.
 I have installed the Emacs Application Framework and been messing around with it. It's awesome, but I can't play video files in it! As far as I can tell, everything is set up as it should be but it simply is not playing anything.
 Here is the relevant portion of my .emacs file:
 (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/") (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/app/eaf-video-player/") (require 'eaf) (require 'eaf-browser) (require 'eaf-pdf-viewer) (require 'eaf-terminal) (require 'eaf-video-player) 
 As you can see, the video player is indeed installed. I also installed qt-ubuntu from snap and ffmpeg from apt (I am on Ubuntu) to see if either of those would help (they didn't but I haven't restarted my computer since I installed those so maybe that would do something [update: rebooting did not do anything]?)
 The web browser, PDF viewer, and terminal work just fine (I haven't messed with the other plugins yet). However, when I try to run the video player on a video file, this happens.
 As you can see, the video editor is in fact on, in some sense, but nothing is here! I am not a Linux or powerful text editor newbie (I am a recent veteran of Neovim which i customized heavily) so I know may way around installing stuff and troubleshooting, but I'm nowhere near experienced enough to debug super complicated issues, so I've found myself stuck here. Any ideas on what might be going on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 This might be a stupid or rather difficult question. When you are surfing on the web, and you come across a tutorial that you were looking for hours, and you consider that tutorial or parts of it a piece of gold to avoid boilerplate and save tons of hours of re-googling, how do you store that information using org-mode? 
 Technically speaking, we are talking about non-actionable information that could be used potentially in the future. Do you use org-roam for this kind of stuff or what? And how do you organize the files, independent from your GTD workflow (if you have)? 
 Would love to hear your methods, since I have a lot of tabs temporarily saved in bookmark on Firefox but I know that I would like to store that information filtered and processed by me. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just came across Ctrl-Shift-E.
 It's shy though:
  
it pops up a tiny window that disappears if I try to screenshot it (and comes right back after the screenshot is taken).
 
C-h k C-S-e doesn't even help!?
 
C-q C-S-e doesn't want to quoted-insert it.
 
Search engines have never heard of it apparently.
 
C-g doesn't extinguish it. enter and esc do.
 
For both global and local, (local-unset-key (kbd "C-S-E")) doesn't unset it.
 
 So how does it behave?
 It opens a tiny window, that you can type in, and if you hit enter it places those contents at the cursor. But you can't type spaces. The tiny window is draggable. The tiny window has a hardcoded character e at the beginning of it, for who knows why.
 What on earth is this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,I searched far and wide but, with my limited competency, I was unable to find a writing tracker for org-mode that could tell me how many words per hour I produce. I want to know this to become more prolific.
 Here's an example writing tracker implementation done in Google spreadsheets: https://thespreadsheetwiz.com/automatic-writing-tracker/
 I don't need something as elaborate. But there doesn't seem to be any solution that pairs word count with clock data.
 There are a few packages that will count words for you, such as org-wc, which produces nice overlays of total word count per subtree: https://github.com/tesujimath/org-wc
 Or tracktable that embeds a table with a daily word count into your buffer: https://github.com/tty-tourist/org-tracktable
 But nothing that combines word counts with clock data, both of which I have in my file.
 Unless I missed something? Please let me know if you know.
 I use DOOM if it makes any difference.

For instance, I may want to see how much memory Slack is really consuming in my Firefox window. From the CLI something like =top= gives good information, but attempting to search for emacs wrappers of top has proved an exercise in frustration. What recommendations have you folks, for viewing resource usage of system processes?

 The EAF wiki only has instructions for DOOM Emacs and Spacemacs users , I tried to implement it for normal evil mode , but was unsucessfull. Does anyone have a setup they can share ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, we have Control.Monad.Trans.Cont for continuations:
 `newtype ContT r m a = ContT ((a -> m r) -> m r)`
 `type Cont = ContT r Identity`
 `reset :: Cont r r -> Cont r' r`
 `shift :: ((a -> r) -> Cont r r) -> Cont r a`
 We have `shift` and `reset` for performing continuation, but it is hard to wrap my head around what these does..
 Like, what does "captures the continuation up to the nearest enclosing reset" mean?
 Why does it capture up to the enclosing reset? How does it interact with callCC and others?
 I am lost. Could you give me pointers on how to understand it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I've written a small "proof of concept" type package nrql.el for interacting with NewRelic (an application performance monitoring and logging tool). In my current job, I do a lot of investigation into our production issues. org-mode is a huge part of my daily workflow, and I wanted something that would make it easier to save NewRelic queries (and their results) in org-mode as I typically will export an org-mode heading to html to format the text in a way that is easy to share between many different services (Confluence/Jira/Github/ect.). 
 If there are any other NewRelic and Emacs users out there hopefully this is useful! Also, I'd love some feedback elisp wise as it's my first serious attempt at writing a package for Emacs. A lot is still pretty rudimentary like error handling, but if you have interest in something like this let me know as it currently meets my needs, and I'm wondering if I should take it further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting with emacs -Q -l ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el, I then eval-buffer this buffer:
 (straight-use-package 'org) (with-eval-after-load 'org-agenda (setq org-agenda-files '("~/todo.org")) (setf (cdr (assoc 'todo org-agenda-sorting-strategy)) '(effort-up)) ;; Sort just by effort (setf (cdr (assoc 'todo org-agenda-prefix-format)) " %i %-12:c %-6e")) ;; So I can see effort in the todo list 
 If I then do M-x org-agenda t, I'm presented with
 todo: 0:30 TODO C todo: 0:15 TODO B todo: 0:45 TODO A 
 However, if I comment out (straight-use-package 'org) (i.e. using the built-in Org instead of the latest version), I get the expected output of
 todo: 0:15 TODO B todo: 0:30 TODO C todo: 0:45 TODO A 
 org-version and load-history confirm that the first version is using Org 9.5, while the second is using Org 9.4.4. Did sorting agenda items by effort change in 9.5?
 For completeness, inbox.org just looks like:
 * TODO A :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:45 :END: * TODO B :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:15 :END: * TODO C :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:30 :END: 
 I'm on GNU Emacs 27.2, with Arch Linux, Linux 5.10.64-1-lts x86_54, and Org 9.5-g531577.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was doing a problem sheet to play around with haskell syntax and I have to write a function :
 graft :: Rose -> [ Rose ] -> (Rose , [ Rose ])
 graft = undefined
 which takes a "parent" tree and a list of "child" trees and grafts each of the children to the leaves of the parent as we move from left to right. What is the most efficient way to do this?
 Notice how the function returns two pieces of data: the grafted tree as well as a list. This second value can be used if the length of the list of children does not match the number of leaves of the parent. For example, if there are not enough child trees in the list, your function should simply continue without modifying the remaining leaves and and return the grafted tree as well as the empty list. Conversely, if there are more children than there are leaves of the parent, then your function should return the grafted tree as well as the list of child trees which are left over.

 As far as I can tell, the way to do this would be to supply the output of (region-beginning) and (region-end) to a function that would insert text at a point.
 Unfortunately, I can't find a function to do this, or even functions to manually set the point, and then use (insert) to place the text.
 Am I going about this in the way? I know it's a very simple task just to write the tags, but I have to do it a lot and would like to automate it.
 EDIT: I figured it out, the function is a little hacky, but it does work. Note: the mess in the (insert) functions is to make it output \( \), disregard it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.1.2.
 What is Iron ?
 Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.
 Here is a simple example: ```scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.log)
 log(-1d) //Compile-time error ```
 New features of 1.1.2
 Mathematics
 This release make Iron closer to mathematics by providing two features: - A new A / B alias which has the same meaning than x € A / B(x) in mathematics. The old A ==> B alias is kept but deprecated for retrocompatibility reasons.
  
A new algebraic system allowing the user to write their constraint like a mathematical equation: ```scala
  
def acos(x: Double / (-1d <= ?? <= 1d)): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.acos) acos(1d) //Right(0) acos(1.5) //Error ```
 Check this page for further information.
 Compile-time evaluation support for composed constraints
 Before 1.1.2, constraints like And, Or, Not etc... Weren't evaluable at compile-time. They were evaluated at runtime only. This update now allows you evaluate complex/composed constraints at compile-time: scala def acos(x: Double / (Greater[-1d] && Less[1d])): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.acos) acos(1.2) //Compile-time error 
 Note: Compile-time evaluation is also supported by the new algebra system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an exercise, where I have to write a function that returns True if the first parameter's list's length is larger than the second parameter (Int type).
 Now, there's a test case where the first parameter is an infinite list ([1..]), therefore I can't just simply write `| length x > y = True` in my pattern guard, since that would cause an infinite loop. How can I check if a list is infinite or not? If it's infinite, then the function should always return `True`.
 ​
 EDIT: The second parameter is only a number, so my example should look like this:
 longer [1..] 3000 == True

 I have looked up on google and found a similar problem in this google group. 
 Like if there is a {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} or a single line comment in the first line, this error will show up.
 Everything can build successfully so I think the problem is on VScode...
 Is there anybody encountered with the similar problem?

 ```scala case class Coordinate(azimuth: Double, elevation: Double)
 def method(arg: Seq[Byte]): Coordinate // represents a point on a globe ```
 I need the method to be approximately equal to the value corresponding to the catalog entry for the byte sequence that represents it. Basically, I need this test to pass:
 scala val testValue: Seq[Byte] = ??? assert(method(testValue))(approximatelyEquals(Coordinate(azi1, ele1))) //values from spec catalog correlating byte sequences to expected Coordinate values 
 The signature of approximatelyEquals is
 scala def approximatelyEquals[A: Numeric](reference: A, tolerance: A): Assertion[A] 
 I am unsure of how to make this work with the Coordinate class. I need an instance of Numeric for Coordinate, but it doesn't make much sense, since for example it's not possible to order points on a globe.
 Basically what I need is to make sure that the elevation and azimuth values are close to the azimuth and elevation values that are expected. As it relates to the title, I need to get an ADT to understand the typeclass of its arguments, if it has arguments that all have the same typeclass as this type does.

If so here is what I have to do
 Implement the function puzzle, it will simulate the game similar to 15 Puzzle. In our case, we have 25 squares, where 24 squares are ocupied by tiles with big case letters from 'A' to 'X'. One tile is free, it is denotated by ' '. In one move, you can move a tile (denotated by its letter) into the free one. The function gets the original configuration and a sequence of valid moves. It will output the resulting configuration.
 If anyone would help me I would really appretiate it, though I am quite broke so I can't afford paying, I am rellying on generosity and charity of this community

 Which Emacs theme would you recommend for a glossy screen in order to minimize glare when working in a well lit environment. Currently I'm using doom-vibrant, and even though it looks great in a dimly lit room, when it gets brighter, there a lot of glare even with the screen at 400nits.

 With the advent of Emacs 28's native compilation, it's only possible when we apply the highest available native-comp-speed (which is non-default) so it's unreliable.
 Today I happened to jump into named-let in subr-x.el, which according to the manual can be used just like Clojure's loop - which can be utilized in place of TCO funtions - therefore I decided to define a clone for the latter.
 lisp ;;;###autoload (defmacro clj-loop (bindings &rest body) "Evaluates BODY in a lexical context in which the symbols in the BINDING-forms are bound to their respective initial bindings or parts therein. Acts as a recur target." (declare (indent defun)) `(named-let recur ,(seq-partition ;; Convert vector to list (append bindings nil) 2) ,@body)) 
 ```lisp
 (clj-loop [i 0] (if (= i (expt 2 20)) i (recur (1+ i)))) ;; => 1048576
 (defun fibo-2expt (num) (clj-loop [a 0 b 1 n (expt num 2)] (if (zerop n) a (recur b (+ a b) (1- n))))) (fibo-2expt 3) ;; => 34 `` Although initial expressions' indentations are a bit funny & there's no destructuring, I think it's still helpful to share, because I haven't seen anyone suggestednamed-let` as a built-in workaround for TCO. (Sorry for shamelessly ripping off documentation from Clojure's).

 ​
 How do I add I implement Foo.equals(Foo) for Foo / for every extending class? (So Bar.equals(Foo), Baz.equals(Foo) would need to be implemented.)
 Ideally Bar(x1) == Bar(x2) <= x1 == x2, Baz(y1) == Baz(y2) <= y1 == y2.
 Does it need to be a sealed abstract class rather than a sealed trait?Foo must be sealed because I need to use pattern matching.

 type CacheObject a = { fetch :: forall m . MonadEffect m => m a } get :: forall a m . MonadEffect m => CacheObject a -> m a get c = c.fetch 
 while the following does not
 type CacheObject a m = (MonadEffect m) => { fetch :: m a } get :: forall a m . MonadEffect m => CacheObject a m -> m a get c = c.fetch 
 The compile error starts with
  Could not match constrained type MonadEffect t3 => t3 a1 with type m0 a1 
 Can someone explain why this is?
