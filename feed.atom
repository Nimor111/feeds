 Remote work is possible, but Houston candidates are preferrable. Or if remote then as close to the CST time zone as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading about "storyboarding" as a useful way to arrange research and prepare to write. The book (Turabian) said the utility of a storyboard versus an outline, is that you can easily move information around. This made me think of org mode, which I already use productively for outlining. 
 So I know it already can do the basic task of storyboarding as is. However, I was curious about whether org mode could display information more like a "storyboard." Either horizontally or (maybe better for not having to scroll so much) tiling.
 I imagine this would work with the top level heading defining a card / unit and then units would be displayed horizontally or in a grid, rather than a vertical list.
 Is this something that already exists?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fourmolu is a formatter for Haskell source code. It is a fork of Ormolu, with upstream improvements continually merged.
 0.12 comes with some pretty notable changes: * GHC 9.6 support * A new single-constraint-parens option for disabling the feature of adding parentheses to contexts with one constraint * A new column-limit option for breaking lines at a given length (as much as possible) * A new --print-defaults CLI flag for generating a default fourmolu.yaml config file
 With this release, we're also excited to announce a new website: https://fourmolu.github.io! The website contains a web app where you can paste in Haskell code, change configuration values, and see the result. It also contains docs for each of the configuration options with examples. As this is the first release of the web app, there are bound to be bugs and things that could be improved, so please write an issue for anything you find in the web app!

 Long time user of emacs (since 1994 or 5 using emacs in terminal on a sun sparc workstation) but not a long time init.el file customizer. But now I'm trying to fix some things that really bug the crap out of me and this is one. I use which-key (because my memory sucks), but as you see from the gif, it shifts the buffers in the main windows. Is there a way to prevent this so that when the side window goes away, the buffers (and cursor position) remain at their original position?

 I've used the profiler, but there's nothing to see, it's just opening/saving the file.
 I've looked at task manager and I'm spotting any culprits (the two machines have different AV setups).
 I'm using the 64 bit 28.2 version on both machines. 
 I've chased all over the internet looking for things to try and nothing seems to make a difference. I've been using emacs in one version or another since the 80s and this is the first time I'm considering giving up on it. 
 Using docker or cygwin is a possibility on one of the machines, but not the one I use for client work.
 Any ideas?

 I use the API to parse the buffer and I select headings for further processing:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am still trying to get two-way sync'ed calendars working in Emacs (it seems to me this is the most under-developed aspect in the Emacs eco-system).
 I found vdirsyncer which seems like a nice and promising idea similar to maildir which I already use with notmuch, even though it seems too opinionated and the support for Google calender seems largely untested/unsupported.
 More annoyingly, Microsoft Exchange calendars do not support CalDAV which means one must use tools like davmail. I've had little success getting DavMail to work with two-factor authentication and vdirsyncer also warns that davmail can lead to data loss or strange issues (davmail seems too big, being in Java, for me to hack around). 
 Has anyone had success using Exchange calenders in Emacs? What is your workflow?
 Is anyone using vdirsyncer with Google and/or Exchange? Any hints you can share?
 Thanks!
 PS: I've asked a similar question before and I know of org-caldav, which still requires a CalDAV proxy and org-gcal, which only works for Google.

 Back when I discovered flyspell, it was (for me) a big leap forward in usability and speed. I've used it since, until now. Even so flyspell is nice, it still made editing feel a bit sluggish. Therefore I enabled it only, when editing prose and never while coding.
 But jinx is so fast and non-disturbing, I keep it globally enabled all the time.
 You might like it, too. :)
 (I'm using it on Linux, and do not know how well it works on other OSes, since it utilizes libenchant.)

 I want to parse a simple line with a Regex.
 Regex match will return a Maybe (Array (Maybe String)). I'd like to lift the inner array. Is there a library function that does Array (Maybe a) -> Maybe (Array a) (or even Array m a -> m Array a)? I can't find anything with that exact signature on pursuit, but I'm not crazily experienced using it... ;)
 Also, is this a very bad approach? My target files have some lines matching the regex and others that don't. A valid line will match all groups, and I need to access all of those groups individually in the next step.
 I'm also not that fluent yet in the group theory speak...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a problem that intrigued my mind which i solved lately.
 I have many org files under a Dropbox directory. And also i have a scratch.org file on my desktop. I have wanted an easy way to refile all headings from scratch.org file to files in dropbox. I thought of an elisp form at the top of the file which will act like a button by evaluating with eval-last-sexp command.
 I also wanted this refiling thing for the files in Dropbox. Every file would refile to a specific file.
 I couldn't create those elisp forms that will act like buttons easily. It was harder than i thought. I found org-refile function hard to work with programmatically. 
 After wasting so much time about this problem, i found a rather simpler and maybe even intuitive solution.
 I add local variables to each org file. An org-refile-targets and org-archive-location variable for every file. This solution doesn't give a one click way to refile all headings to a file, but it does give a simpler and focused way to refile and archive headings to specific org-files. 
 I found this solution very satisfying for my workflow. If is there anyone wasting 4 months in order to setup their essential org workflows, i hope this helps.

Capture someday-maybe items as entries with a date 2 weeks in the future
 I evaluate everything in that file every week. If I want to keep the item, I promote it by either moving it to another file, or removing its timestamp.
 For each item, if I haven't promoted it by the time its timestamp rolls around, then org-mode deletes the entry
  
This means I want a plugin or a command or something that will delete items with expired timestamps. I looked through the org manual, and found C-u C-u C-c C-x C-s (https://orgmode.org/manual/Moving-subtrees.html) that will archive items under these circumstances. I want to delete them.
 I suppose I could set up the archive file to be /dev/null ! I'll try that and see what happens.
 [EDIT] I tried to set #+ARCHIVE: /dev/null::%s at the top of the file in question (someday.org), but when I archive using C-c C-x C-a it sends it to ./someday.org_archive instead.
 [EDIT2] I just made it re-read the file and tried again, this time I got the answer that /dev/null isn't going to work :( File exists, but cannot be read Copied: Subtree(s) with 19 characters funcall-interactively: Buffer is read-only: #<buffer null> 
 [EDIT3] I've made peace that someday.org_archive is workable - I'll just think of it as landfill. So where I'm stuck currently, is to make org's capture template set a date 2 weeks in the future when I capture an item to someday.org. I looked through the org manual's entries on capture templates again, but it doesn't look like there's an answer for this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Release Candidate version of Indigo (a Scala 3 pixel art 2D game engine for Scala.js) is the result of six months work and will hopefully become a full release after undergoing a bit more testing. Feel free to take it for a spin! 🚀
 It contains a good number of general improvements that are based on real usage during the production of our biggest demo to date, hopefully coming soon-ish!
 The main bulk of the work is a total replacement of all GLSL based shaders in favour of programs written using Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet is a Scala 3 shader program writing library that is currently aimed at WebGL + GLSL. The purpose of this work is to begin to separate Indigo from Scala.js and WebGL, so that the project can look at supporting other rendering technologies (WebGPU is the next likely target), and one day, other platforms like the JVM and/or Native. Custom GLSL shaders will still be supported for the for the foreseeable future, but existing shaders will require very minor modification to be compatible.
 Indigo's website is slowly going through a necessary rebuild, so for now it's advisable to check out the release notes below if you decide to try this version out. Alternatively, do come and say hello on our Discord server if you need any help, or even just to show off what you're making. 😁

 I am quite stuck with trying to think of a way to implement a createDecisionTree function. But first, some background!
 Here's the DecisionTree datatype, which is pretty much just a Rose Tree
 data DecisionTree a = DecisionTree a [DecisionTree a] deriving Show 
 I am trying to explore the Decision Tree of a game by modelling the different states one can take from a particular state
 possibleGameStates :: GameState -> [GameState] 
 There's a possibility of a lot of overlapping GameStates, so I introduced a Set into the picture
 uniqueGameStates :: SET.Set GameState -> GameState -> ([GameState], SET.Set GameState) uniqueGameStates alreadyExplored g = let allPossFiltered = filter (\x -> not (SET.member x alreadyExplored)) $ possibleGameStates g newSet = SET.union (SET.fromList (g : allPossFiltered)) alreadyExplored in (allPossFiltered, newSet) oneLayer :: SET.Set GameState -> [GameState] -> ([[GameState]], SET.Set GameState) oneLayer s [] = ([[]], s) oneLayer s (g : gs) = let (iRes, newSet) = uniqueGameStates s g in (iRes : fst (oneLayer newSet gs), newSet) 
 I want to write a createDecisionTree function 
 createDecisionTree :: SET.Set GameState -> GameState -> DecisionTree GameState 
 But I have no idea how to compose oneLayer together with uniqueGameStates to create the DecisionTree. Oh, and btw, I have a inEndState :: GameState -> Bool function as well for the base case of createDecisionTree. I have no idea what the recursive case looks like. Help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last year or so I've been trying editors and environments to see what fits me. 
 I installed doom emacs and really quite fell in love with it. But I couldn't make an Emacs config from scratch. Just wasn't a task I could do. It would take maybe a week worth of effort to me.
 Just this weekend I decided I'll give neovim a chance. I started making my config from scratch and found it MUCH easier. Followed some videos and after 2 days I have something I really like and more importantly I understand every snippet of code that went into the config.
 I miss some things. The commands pallete on doom was amazing. Every command, every keymap all just there. Magit is a godsend. So is org mode.
 I have no doubt I will eventually hop back to emacs but neovim has given me the confidence to be able to write my own config. 
 What do you guys think?

 I am curious as to what colors you use for the different levels of headings and if there is some logic behind it...
 Do you simply pick random colors based on gut instinct or do you subscribe to some color theory?
 Or do you differentiate the different levels in another way - using different font-sizes maybe? Or maybe different fonts AND different colors?
 What is your style and why (I am looking for some inspiration...)?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I've tried LSP so many times and I'm too frustrated with how difficult and hard it is to configure. Trying to look at other people's configs for this is a nightmare.
 I wanted to ask: Does anyone have an Emacs config that configured LSP or Eglot mode along with proper indentation that 'just works' for the following modern web development frameworks and languages:
  
React
 Vue
 Ruby On Rails
 JavaScript
 TypeScript
 Python
 HTML
 CSS
  
​
 Anything related would be wonderful as I'm sick of trying to fight Emacs to even get this to work properly, even when indentation is concerned.

 I'd like to be able to continue from a session (window/tab layouts) when I reconnect over ssh.
 Is there some way to get emacs to save the previous session so that when I ssh back (after disconnecting) I could continue from a previous emacsclient session the way tmux allows attaching to an existing session?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know TRAMP slowness is a recurring topic here, but I didn't see a suggestion on this particular phenomena yet, so asking for advice.
 When I connect to a host at work, TRAMP is trying to find version control configuration all over the file system on the remote host. Git / Bzr / Hg / Svn, in current directory, one directory up, and up, and up... I can trace it in the debug buffer it is taking more than a minute to finish this process which is awkward. I am working from Eastern Europe via VPN, and the remote host is in the US, so it takes a couple of hops while one command completes.
 Is there any way to prevent these checks? I care about version control on my local machine only.
 Thanks.

One inconvenience is that when I run `helm-find-files` under a Windows mount (e.g. /mnt/c/Users/me/Downloads) once, then I later add a file under that folder, and then I run `helm-find-files` again, the latter doesn't seem to update and show the latest files added. Dired and shell work correctly. Also regular files under ~/ work as expected. What could it be? And how could I have an up-to-date output with `helm-find-files` even in mounted dirs? Thanks!

 In Doom Emacs, the frame appears as soon as Emacs becomes ready for usage. How is that? Doom Emacs says it took 0.7 seconds to startup, while my vanilla emacs config took 0.37 (i already tweaked early-init), so i guess the DOOM Emacs' devs have configured it so that either the messages do not appear in the echo area or the frame appears only when emacs becomes ready for usage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For my own reasons, I've come to use the di- prefix to mean half, in opposition to bi- meaning twice. This has affected me in that difunctor seems to be an older / alternative term with the same meaning as profunctor, as is evidenced by the Profunctor class itself:
 haskell class Profunctor p where dimap :: (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> p b c -> p a d lmap :: (a -> b) -> p b c -> p a cw rmap :: (b -> c) -> p a b -> p a c 
 It is actually quite awkward, this straddling of both pro- and di-. The type class name uses the pro- terminology (as in pre, and post), but the functions use the di-, l-, and r- terminology. This is unfortunate, as the Profunctor thus claims essential parts of both terminologies.
 For quite some time, I've actually thought of these in my head as promap, premap and postmap, as I have my own orthogonal use case for the di- nomenclature, having derived another dimap (and rmap, lmap) - but they clash in name with the existing profunctor functions, even though prodifunctor and prodimap in my nomenclature are actually sensible classes worth exploring. Privately I've been content with masking this, as I have alternative ways of deriving names, but I thought it was worth discussing with the community.
 What are your thoughts on the positives and consequences of changing the Profunctor nomenclature such that dimap = promap, lmap = premap, and rmap = postmap?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently migrated from straight to elpaca. I'm generally very pleased with the results, but there is one issue I don't know how to resolve, even after reading the manual and trying various searches online. The issue is pretty simple: I don't seem to be able to get elpaca to load updates to any use-package expression after Emacs has started.
 For example, let's say I want to set the value of the user option org-hide-emphasis-markers to t in my config file. I then add (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t) to the use-package section of org-mode:
 elisp (use-package org :demand t :config (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)) 
 (Assume for simplicity that I have no other org-mode customizations.)
 To test the effects of this change, I run eval-last-sexp with point at the end of the macro. However, nothing happens: the new value is not set.
 I thought this may be related to the asynchronous nature of how elpaca handles packages. But evaluating (elpaca-process-queues) has no effect.
 Apologies if I'm missing something obvious.

 Specifically, a C/C++ programmer may have some fun using OpenCL, vulkan or coda on NVIDIA hardware. I know that there are bindings for scala to many of these libraries but honestly I don’t see using them in a functional context to add much wrt the imperative way, instead they tend to be more limited in scala.
 Even more, recent devices like rk3588 are equipped with a NPU, is there a way to have fun with it with Scala?
 What’s your thoughts about this? ZP

 For example, say we have a simple expression language...
 data Expr = Num Int | Add Expr Expr | Mul Expr Expr makeBaseFunctor ''Expr 
 We can define a "debug print" for an Expr which prints its tree structure. Taking inspiration from the example from the recursion-schemes docs, we can use an effectful fold in Reader that keeps track of the current depth:
 type Depth = Int debugPrint :: Expr -> String debugPrint e = runReader (cata debugAlg e) 0 where debugAlg :: ExprF (Reader Depth String) -> Reader Depth String debugAlg e = do depth <- ask let (name, body) = case e of NumF n -> ("Num " ++ show n, []) AddF e1 e2 -> ("Add", [e1, e2]) MulF e1 e2 -> ("Mul", [e1, e2]) ss…]]></summary>

Seeing that he was left org-mode for a new tool, discouraged me from using Emacs and building my own config. It also encouraged me to try Logseq, which is one of the most popular PKM tools alongside Obsidian.
 He says in the tweet:
  
It gives me a lot of what I've used Emacs org-mode for in the past, but with a less fussy interface and less temptation to tinker. (Moving from a system best described as Big Bag of Google Docs, per topic or person.)
  
For me, it was the opposite. I was never as productive as when I was used Emacs. Logseq out of box is very powerful in some aspects, especially in handling multimedia. For example, you can embed a YouTube video and take notes based on …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new release of SBV is now on hackage, supporting quantifiers, quantifier alternation, quantifier elimination, and skolemization. This allows users to express and prove first-order logic theorems. (Of course, the underlying solver---typically z3---may not be able to determine theoremhood, since first-order logic is semi-decidable. However, modern SMT solvers can handle most instances that come up in practice.)
 Here's a simple example:
 Prelude Data.SBV> :set -XDataKinds Prelude Data.SBV> sat $ \(Forall @"x" x) (Exists @"y" y) -> y .== (x + 1 :: SInteger) Satisfiable Prelude Data.SBV> sat $ skolemize $ \(Forall @"x" x) (Exists @"y" y) -> y .== (x + 1 :: SInteger) Satisfiable. Model: y :: Integer -> Integer y x = 1 + x 
 A set of first-order-logic examples are included in the release. As usual, bug reports, comments, and contributions are most welcome at the github repo.
 Happy proving!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've developed pure Haskell quicksort on mutable vectors while aiming to match performance of std::sort from C++. While not really hitting that bar, the result is within around 20% in sequential mode and is faster in parallel mode.
 In addition, the package exposes reasonable default sort for most users suitable for just importing and sorting without thinking twice what's going on under the hood.
 Parallelisation is implemented via both sparks and threads and the method is selectable. Unfortunately threads don't show much speedup but users can define ther own, hopefully faster, methods to parallelise. Sparks-based parallelisation is much faster but unfortunately will use all available capabilities at runtime so it's less controllable.
 The repository is https://github.com/sergv/vector-quicksort and the benchmarks are under https://github.com/sergv/vector-quicksort#benchmarks.

 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.6.2
 If you want to see Tyrian in action, check out the amazing all new Rock the JVM "The Typelevel Rite of Passage"* course to watch the build of a full-stack web application from scratch! It's an excellent introduction to Scala.js.
 https://rockthejvm.com/p/typelevel-rite-of-passage
 Also keep an eye out of Daniel Ciocîrlan's recent Scalar Conference 2023 talk when hits YouTube. (Hopefully soon, I hear good things and can't wait to see it!)
 If you'd prefer to read about it, Gabriel Volpe's brilliant new book "Functional Event-Driven Architecture" includes a bonus chapter featuring Tyrian, in which he ports his trading app from Elm to Tyrian.
 https://leanpub.com/feda
 https://github.com/gvolpe/trading/tree/main/modules/ws-client
 Tyrian's giter8 template has also been brought up to date, meaning that you can get your first Tyrian app up and running in five minutes flat! Give it a try, what's the worst that can happen?
 sbt new PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian.g8
 Many thanks, as always, to Tyrian's contributors and community. I love it when people drop into our little Discord server to show us what they've been building!
 (* Please note that while the course and book mentioned above are both based on the Typelevel and Cats Effect ecosystem, Tyrian works with any compatible effect type, and we have a small but growing number of Tyrian+ZIO users too.)

 main :: IO () main = do print $ funAlias data1 == False print $ funAlias data2 == True print $ funAlias data3 == True ```
 And I got errors.
 sh src/06.hs:19:17: error: • Couldn't match type ‘Char’ with ‘Int’ Expected: [Int] Actual: String • In the first argument of ‘solve’, namely ‘data2’ In the first argument of ‘(==)’, namely ‘solve data2’ In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘solve data2 == True’ | 19 | print $ solve data2 == True | ^^^^^ 
 I (maybe) understood I can't define an alias of polymorphic function but I can't figure out what is happend actually. 
 Please show me what is wrong. And making an alias of function is bad manner in Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I'm trying to find a concise name for a special pattern of using return type values as a place to collect evidence about an underlying implementation.
 The essence of the pattern is to replace what would usually be Unit with a new, distinct type. On the trait definition level, the return type is kept abstract, so that each implementation can decide for itself what it means for it to be correct. On the implementation level, however, the type is defined such that it enumerates what evidence is necessary to consider this specific implementation correct. When multiple levels of traits/implementations are at play, the evidence is propagated from level to level in its abstract form.
 The following example should give you a general idea of what I'm talking about:

 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library enabling developers to attach constraints (also called "refinement") to types. These constraints are evaluable at compile-time and/or at runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive = 5 //OK val y: Int :| Positive = -4 //Compile-time error! val z: Int :| Positive = -4.refine //Runtime exception. Variants for `Option`, `Either` etc... exist 
 Check the Github page for more information.
 Features of v2.1.0
 New error messages
 Iron now has enhanced compile-time errors, clearer and more explicit.
 ```scala def log(x: Double :| Positive): Double = Math.log(x)

 I have come across Alex(https://serokell.io/blog/lexing-with-alex) and Happy which are libraries for scanning tokens and parsing but as a beginner I would like to look at code that uses Haskell directly. There is a toy grammar for this.My goal is to learn FP for this use case so that I can use the new pattern matching features using records in Java.
 I can compile and execute Haskell( or Ocaml ) in Spacemacs.
 Is there a book for that ? I know about Appel's books. I am particularly interested in patterns like zipper which I have already coded. Are similar patterns useful for parsing and scanning ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm looking to migrate to vanilla emacs, and I thought I'd kick things off by asking you all for advice.
 I'm terrible at emacs, but I've been managing to limp along with it as my primary driver for a good number of years now. I used vim for many years, but then I switched to spacemacs for some time and moved on to doom a little while back. I absolutely love the idea of a modal space menu, and the evil integrations have been fantastic for me.
 BUT. Even though they're great projects, I'd really like to be done with things like spacemacs and doom. They've been a great way for me to see what's out there, but all the built-in customization makes it really hard for someone like me to understand where various behaviors are actually coming from, and at least a few times I've discovered that after much hair-pulling what I thought were plugin bugs were actually problems with the customization layers. I feel like I always end up stripping away as many of the customizations as possible.
 My use case is essentially solid support for C++, maybe some python and glsl, and that's pretty much it. I know eglot & clangd/ccls work well for the c++ part, which i feel covers quite a bit of what I need. With eglot and things like use-package becoming a part of emacs in 29, I'm really getting the itch to just build things up from vanilla emacs, so that I know exactly what is custom and what isn't.
 External things I know I'd like:
  
spacemacs-style menu (is this a package?)
 magit
 ranger for file browsing
 evil integration everywhere possible
  
What major headaches do people see lurking here if I'm keeping things pretty minimal?

 I am running emacs on a Linux machine in terminator with a dark background. The default colors are hard to read, with dark blue on black being used for certain faces and I believe emacs is misunderstanding the background color.
 I think I should be able to set frame-background-mode to help with this. I tried adding (set-variable 'frame-background-mode 'dark) or (frame-set-background-mode 'dark) to my .emacs file, and still when I go into emacs it shows the variable value as being nil.
 Any advice on this, and whether this is the right approach?

My week has been wonderful. I got my Python programming project to a stage where I could release it. I've slowly restarted working in the woodshop. My health is starting to stabilize. I'm getting back in the gym with regularity.  I guess you all didn't want to hear all that personal stuff.
Zettelkasting has been slow, and life is distracting. My seminar is wrapping up. Only 2 more classes, a larger writing project, and a public reading left. This will take up much of my time over the next 3 weeks. My seven-day zettel production reflects my zettelkasting speed. Most of the content is ENGL501 Traditions of Food Writing related.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 there's a specific type of buffer where I can't view non latin characters (hebrew in my case). In all other buffers and minibuffer pop-ups hebrew characters are presented fine, but I'm using prot's `denote` package, which creates a backlinks buffer (nvm exactly what that is if your unfamilliar) using xrefs - and the text in that buffer gets displayed withe characters' numbers, but not the actual letters.
 I have the following in my config file:
 ;; UTF-8 as default encoding
 (set-language-environment "English")
 (set-language-environment "UTF-8")
 (set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8)
 (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
 (set-input-method 'hebrew-full)
 ;; do this especially on Windows, for python output problems
 (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
 And I'm using Doom emacs on windows.
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi community,
 as syntax is contentious a topic as ever, David (the main proposal author) and I would like to invite you to give your input on https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/585, where we propose to change the syntax of the accepted proposal #522 introducing Or patterns. In particular, we'd like to know
  
Whether you like the syntax ((one of 1,2,3), 4) in the original proposal better than the amended one mirroring case of: (one of {1;2;3},4)
 
Whether you like that it is subject to layout, similar to case of, e.g., 
 f (one of 1 2 3) = 4
 Which looks kind of funny here, but perhaps has foreseen use cases.
 
Whether you think it's good or bad to allow f (one of {}) (with layout just f (one of), even), and whether the semantics should be a strict match (mirroring case x of {}) or lazy (like case x of _ -> ...)
 
If you have experience with writing tools for GHC Haskell, whether mirroring case of syntax poses new problems for you, especially caused by it being subject to layout rules
 
 (Note that we understand that you might not like either syntax. That is fine, but the linked proposal thread is not the place to have that discussion. In all honesty, the syntactic appearance is not why we like Or patterns, rather the opposite.)
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, my emacs started having all sorts of problems connected to utf8 characters. I think I traced the problem back to emacs not opening my init.el with utf8 encoding for some reason. I set utf8 characters as the values of several variables in init.el, and this causes problem in other buffers even when emacs determines the encoding of these other buffers correctly.
 I tried using #'recode-region and #'set-buffer-file-coding-system to reencode init.el, but if I restart emacs it keeps detecting the file as "no-encoding". I also tried using (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8-unix) but that didn't help either.
 I'm out of ideas. Does anyone have suggestions for what else I can try?

 Today I wanted to write a set of functions to communicate with hammerspoon (the idea is to display in the menu bar the name of the task clocked in, and a continuous update of the time spend in it). I was able to complete my goal faster using chatGPT. When the task is clocked out, reset the menu bar.
 Here is example of what it shows "[0:07] (doing som.." truncated so it does not take too long

 ever since macOS decided to drop emacs, I’ve been wondering for quite awhile what terminal editor is intended to be used instead? I’ve been focusing on using nano (in both Ubuntu and macOS) for about a year or two and I’ve discovered I can’t unlearn emacs bindings after using it for over 25 years - it takes *more* effort to slow down and translate what I want to do into a nano binding which just doesn’t seem efficient to me (not to mention all the times I’ve had to undo my mistakes!)
 I‘m well aware I can just install emacs through homebrew and just wondering what alternatives exist out there compatible with emacs bindings? [and I’m not looking for anything fancy - 95% of the time I’m just doing basic editing of a config file or README.txt]
 I could have sworn there exists a lightweight terminal editor compatible with emacs bindings included with macOS now and I can’t find any reference to it so thought I’d wave the white flag and post here!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand one little mystery in my init file, but can't seem to figure it out.
 I have the following snippet in my init file to add some custom searches for rg:
 (with-eval-after-load 'rg ;; Provide some custom searches for Lisp libraries (rg-define-search rg-emacs-lisp "Search the Emacs lisp default libraries." :dir "/usr/local/share/emacs/" :flags '("--search-zip") :files "*.{el,el.gz}" :menu ("Emacs Libraries" "b" "Built-in")) (rg-define-search rg-emacs-elpa "Search Elpa packages." :dir package-user-dir :files "all" :flags '("--glob=!*.elc") :menu ("Emacs Libraries" "e" "Elpa"))) 
 With that snippet, right after startup, if I call M-: (featurep 'rg) the answer is t. But, if I comment it out, the answer is nil. So that bit is triggering the loading of rg. But, since it is set (with-eval-after-load 'rg ...) I'd expect this to run only after rg is loaded for some other reason. How does trigger the loading of the package? Is there any way to make these settings while avoiding the loading of rg?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a long time vim user, just started to use emacs a few weeks ago. And there is a feature I like so much in neovim that I wonder if it is possible to acomplish the same in emacs:
 The file tree displays a sign next to folders that have uncommited changes when in a git repository, and also shows a sign when the file or folder contain some error detected by the LSP. Like in the following image:
 nvim-tree
 Is there a way to do this in emacs? I use neotree, but I would be comfortable using any other file tree plugin if I could get this behavior.
 Thank you very much in advance!

 11-1: Document Title (or more accurately this chapter's title)
 INDENTED (1) Some stuff in paragraph form about the intent behind document, etc
 INDENTED (2) Some more stuff
 11-2: Next top level heading

 Reddit dumped the indentation, so I added "INDENTED"

 I'm very new to emacs, my journey has been vim followed by VSCode and now I want to dabble with emacs. I managed to set up evil, which was very straight forward but now I am struggling a lot with everything with typescript. 
 I've identified that I need lsp-mode, lsp-ui, tree-sitter, dap, tree-sitter-langs and tide to have a decent environment up and running. I have the following script setup:
  (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "nongnu" (format "http%s://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/" (if (gnutls-available-p) "s" "")))) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t) (package-initialize) (require 'use-package) ;; EVIL (require 'evil) (evil-mode 1) ;; DAP-MODE (use-package dap-mode) (setq package-list '(dap-mode tree-sitter tree-sitter-langs)) ;; TREE SITTER (require 'tree-sitter-langs) (require 'tree-sitter) ;; Activate tree-sitter globally (minor mode registered on every buffer) (global-tree-sitter-mode) (add-hook 'tree-sitter-after-on-hook #'tree-sitter-hl-mode) (setq package-list '(dap-mode tree-sitter tree-sitter-langs lsp-mode lsp-ui)) (use-package tree-sitter-langs :ensure t :config (tree-sitter-require 'typescript) ) ;; LSP (require 'lsp-mode) (add-hook 'prod-mode-hook #'lsp) (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l") (dolist (package package-list) (unless (package-installed-p package) (package-install package))) 
 I've installed the packages but don't really see anything. No syntax highlighting, nothing. Any clue where to even start?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[State machines are a common abstraction in computer science. They can be used to represent and implement stateful processes.
My interest in them stems from Domain-Driven Design and software architecture. With this blog post I’d like to explain why I think that state machines are a great tool to express and implement the domain logic of applications.
Moreover, I’d like to present crem, a new Haskell library to build state machines, and explain why Haskell plays an important role in making crem special.

The origin: Domain-Driven Design and state machines
If you are familiar with Domain Driven Design, and Event Storming in particular, you have probably already seen the following picture:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone, I created a curated Scala jobs aggregator FairJoin.com - right now it has 350 Scala jobs from 80 Companies. I created it because I've been a Scala Engineer for the past 10 years and it's always been a pain finding jobs that actually use Scala. 
 An example of why it's a pain: LinkedIn claims to have 30,000+ Scala jobs, but you click on most of them and they say "Requires experience with languages like Python C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Rust, Go, Scala, or Kotlin". They just use Scala as a keyword, and you'll never actually use Scala in that job.
 With FairJoin I review every job posting to ensure it has a high likelihood of actually using Scala. It's early stages, but some of the next features I plan on adding are filters for things like location and Scala specific attributes (i.e. Functional, Akka, Cats, Data Engineering), as well as more company info.
 ​
 I hope it's useful, and I'd love to hear your thoughts either here or email me at stephen@fairjoin.com

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using emacs for several months at this point. A few months into it, people started talking about using straight.el instead of package.el, so I moved my configuration over to using straight.el. However, now people are saying package.el is the best option and that people should not really use straight.el anymore. I have had good experience with straight.el since some packages I like are not on melpa. Additionally, I have tried downloading and using emacs-29, and it seems to run into issues when using straight which makes me lean more towards using package.el unless there is some way to fix this. Which package manager should I use, and why (I have also heard about elpaca which seems to have nice UI and fixes some issues that straight has, so what about that versus straight and use-package)?

 Or maybe there is a better approach to the problem I have that I haven't imagined?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On April 20th at 19.30 UTC, I'll be speaking with Simon Peyton Jones, one of the team behind Haskell, on a YouTube livestream. 
 Simon is renowned for his work in lazy functional languages, and I'll be exploring his career of building languages, especially Haskell, but also C-- and most recently Verse. We'll dig into his work at both Microsoft Research and Epic Games, and exploring the lessons we can take from a monumental career. At the end we'll put your questions to him in an AMA.
 Everyone is welcome to come and join in and ask questions. You can set a reminder on YouTube.
 The interview is part of Exercism's #12in23 - a year long challenge to encourage people to try 12 new languages throughout the year. So far, I've interviewed José Valim (Elixir), Louis Pilfold (Gleam), Cameron Balahan (Go), Josh Tripplet (Rust), and  Bjarne Stroustrup (C++) - they're all available to watch back on YouTube!

 I used to use CEDET 15 years ago, and I liked the way it kept the layout fixed, with a lower buffer (similar as to VSCode does it) "capturing" all what could be considered process-output. And then up on top I'm free to do whatever.
 Is there something comparable? I'm wary getting CEDET itself into my life, as all its tools seem to be pretty dated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a short "introduction," I am a 16 year old student from Canada. I've been programming since I was 12, although it wasn't much until I was 14. I picked up python initially so I could "show off" to one of my friends, but I ended up getting hooked on writing C until about halfway through last year, in which I started learning Haskell. I'm firmly convinced that I won't leave Haskell anytime soon, as everything just feels superior to how I was doing stuff before, even if it was harder initially (and still, to a certain extent.) I want to eventually work in I.T, but I'm unsure of the availability of Haskell developer entry positions for once I could actually fathom getting a job working as a developer. I know I'm young and not locked into using any 1 language / stack, but I'm still kind of just wondering what I should consider doing for the future? Thanks!

 My fasting started from 20:05 last night and expects to end on 12:30 today. I firstly tried to calculate the interval by formula "$5=24-$2+$3;U",but it compute a wrong result. So a new column Format 24 hours should be added.
 How could get it done without a cumbersome new column of 24 hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an application where, in my domain types, I have an Event which has many Tags and belongs to a single Venue:
  data Event = Event { -- more than this but tags :: [EventTag], venue :: Venue, } newtype EventTag = EventTag { tagName :: Text } newtype Venue = Venue { venueName :: Text } 
 In the database schema, however, I have tables for tags and venues, and a foreign key relation to the events table.
 I had been using hasql for my database interactions, but found it extremely painful, so I switched to persistent, for which I defined the following schema:
 ``` TagRow sql=tags name Text UniqueTagName name
 VenueRow sql=venues name Text UniqueVenueName name
 EventRow sql=events title Text description (Maybe Text) url URL venueId VenueRowId startDate UTCTime endDate UTCTime origination OriginationURI UniqueOriginationURI origination approvedAt UTCTime rejectedAt UTCTime
 EventTag sql=event_tags eventId EventRowId tagId TagRowId |] ```
 What I'm not sure how to do, is how to insert non-existent tags and venues, and then insert the events, using persistent, in a relatively efficient way. I had done this previously using hasql as can be seen here, which is quite ugly but did the trick.
 I can think of three approaches with persistent, one is to do something analogous to what I'm doing above: write the tags, collecting the ids and names in a mapping, do the same with the venues, then stitch all this together when inserting the events. This one I do not know how to do with persistent. The other would be to process the events one at a time, inserting the tags, then fetching them again, doing the same with the venue, and then inserting the event. This one I think I know how to do with persistent. The final one would be to write it all as raw sql and process it that way, which I'm really not fond of as an idea (and haven't looked into).
 Any pointers / help would be much appreciated.

(setq inhibit-startup-screen t) (setq hello-key (kbd "C-c C-j")) (global-foo-mode 1) 
 I have split the code above into 2 parts. The first part contains the code for the minor mode. The bottom three lines show how the user may use the mode.
 The user wants to set the hello-key to (kbd "C-c C-j") before enabling the mode. But the minor mode ignores this new value of hello-key because it has already used the old value (kbd "C-c C-f") while defining the keymap for the minor mode.
 Is it possible to create a minor mode in a way that every time the user enables the minor mode, the minor mode re-evaluates its keymap?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to use a variant of the EXWM function ((exwm-workspace-move-window (frame-or-index &optional id)) to move an EXWM to another workspace/frame.
 Normally this is accomplished with the C-c RET key combination, but in this case the window in question is an EXWM window running under Xpra so it traps the key combination and handles it itself.
 The way around it is to get the window title of the Xpra window from Emacs/EXWM, derive the window-id from it or find it some other way then pass it to the ((exwm-workspace-move-window (frame-or-index &optional0 id)).
 So begins my excursion into finding Emacs window ids, the X window values and those of frames as well.
 Where do I start?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the pretest version has been released, I cloned and built Emacs 29 on OpenSUSE TW. I used the following options:
 --with-native-compilation=aot --with-x-toolkit=gtk3 --without-xaw3d --with-xinput2 --with-tree-sitter --with-json --without-compress-install CFLAGS='-march=native' 
 I faced an issue, so I searched and found the following comments on Arch AUR:
  
Native JSON support was removed from emacs sometime in the first semester of 2022. In my tests leaving JSON support out had some breaking bugs that made it a non-starter. I have to test it again before adding such switch to t build script.
  
I checked the official Arch package recipe and found that they do not use the --with-json option. The same is with OpenSUSE official package. However, Fedora package does use that option for their building. '
 Anyway, I found a tip that running make bootstrap could solve the issue, and it works. Emacs 29 got compiled successfully, and it now runs flawlessly on my machine since morning. Actually, I'm not sure what the issue was and if it was caused by --with-json option, but I wanted to raise a discussion about whether using this option is not recommended anymore by default.

 There is a variable lsp-css-validate which is set to t in emacs. So I assume it does some validation https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-css/#lsp-css-validate
 But maybe the LSP validation is not as strict as the W3 css validator? https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en
 Scenario where I ran into this was that I had written "scale (1)" instead of the correct "scale(1)". Spent quite a bit of time to hunt this down manually.
 In hindsight I would've spotted the error immediately if I had put the css file through the W3 CSS validator. Maybe next time I'll remember this.

 I'm working on a new project using effectful after having not touched effects in a while. I previously used polysemy and it was a pretty good experience.
 Pawel Szulc once again made a nice talk on using an effect system and it gave me a refresher and some other good information: Effectful | Paweł Szulc | Lambda Days 2022 .
 It's perfectly possible to just implement only the IO interpreter and test that while developing with effectful, and for a while I did just that.
 However things became more interesting once I wanted to start testing. So here are rambly thoughts I've had bouncing around that others might want to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many fonts now support this readability enhancement: to display zero with slashes. This is not a different character (such as a slashed o character: „ Ø ”), but a variation of how zeros are displayed. 
 (This can also be enabled in web browsers with JavaScript script extensions such as Stylus, Stylebot etc.). 
 I understand that some people may be not welcoming change (including this one), but this is important for many things, including programming. I kept trying to make chat-gpt understand what code I'm asking for but it never provides any useful answer, as my current font in Emacs already supports this feature, it is just Emacs which does not make the font display this useful differentiation (variation). 
 Please don't be harsh, for now I'd like to just improve some annoying things in the meanwhile of beginning to learn some more Emacs topics. Regards :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My level is pretty poor, but I've been told--and seen elsewhere--innumerable times that it's a good idea to start working on open source projects.
 I'm aware of one particularly friendly project called Bevy, which is a game engine written in Rust. They have "good-beginner" issues and are extremely nice in both the comments and in Discord, and are very active in helping newcomers. 
 I'd like to not jump into projects that aren't able to allocate resources to helping beginner programmers on trivial problems. It would be a huge waste of their time and I assume disrupting their workflow. 
 I'm mostly just wanting to find projects that mostly meet this criteria. Bonus points if there's an active discord/slack community. 
 Any sector is fine, since I'm trying to branch out and learn what I like. Pretty much any subject goes. I'm more interested in the coding experience/learning the ropes than anything. It'll take time to find out what subject I really like. Right now, I have so much fun coding that the project itself rarely matters.
 My only limitation is that my math background is very poor, so a lot of research-based projects are probably too difficult for me.
 Any info would be really welcome. 
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edits
  
Title should read org-bullets, not bullet-mode. Thank you /u/github-alphapapa.
  
Problem & background
  
New install of default emacs GUI (27.1) on a new EOS 7 install.
 
H4 level bullets are rendering differently to previous 27.1 GUI, they are too big.
 
Examples: Tidy H4 stars on old GUI. New, large flowers on current GUI.
 
 Information
  
Emacs version 27.1 for both. GTK+ Versions - Old: 3.22.30 New: 3.24.30
 
Same config file
 
Same font: "Roboto Mono:pixelsize=13:foundry=pyrs:weight=normal:slant=normal:width=normal:scalable=true"
 
Stars render in the 'old' way if emacs is launched in a terminal using "emacs -nw". 
 
 Desired resolution
  
Get the H4 bullets to render in the same way as the old GUI.
  
If anybody has encountered the following issue, or has ideas for how to fix it, the help would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I run projectile-replace in a file that isn't part of a "project", meaning (as far as I understand it), that the file is located in a directory that doesn't have a .git or a .projectile file, I get blocked by a "Switch to project"-buffer. Is the only solution to actually create one of those marker files in it's directory? Or can I configure Projectile to allow me to run that function on these files?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm struggling to figure out why something isn't working on my end as it should be. And now I'm stuck trying to make sense of the definition of TeX-check-engine. 
 From what I can tell, this function will ask to check the engine only if (but not only if, since there's a few other conditions I'm not listing here) the value of TeX-check-engine-list is set to something other than its default value, presumably to the list of engines required by the file being visited. 
 So here is my question: what is supposed to set the value of that variable? Looking at the docstring, I see that it should depend on what engine is required by the "loaded TeX packages". But I don't see what determines what the loaded TeX packages are, nor how that list is supposed to be updated. 
 (I'm running into difficulties using emacs -Q after reinstalling auctex etc., so I don't see how this could be due to something in my config.)
 If anyone has any pointers, even if not a complete solution, I'd be curious to know what they are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Emacs 28.2. Here is my code:
 ;;; foo.el (define-minor-mode foo-mode "Foo mode" :lighter " Foo" (message "foo-mode %s in buffer %s" foo-mode (buffer-name))) (defun foo-mode-on () (foo-mode 1)) (define-globalized-minor-mode global-foo-mode foo-mode foo-mode-on) 
 This works like I want.
 emacs -q -l foo.el 
 Then I run these things:
 C-x b *scratch* M-x global-foo-mode C-x b foo C-x b bar C-x b baz 
 I find that all buffers foo, bar and baz have Foo mode enabled. But https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Defining-Minor-Modes.html has got this to tell
  
Globally enabling the mode also affects buffers subsequently created by visiting files, and buffers that use a major mode other than Fundamental mode; but it does not detect the creation of a new buffer in Fundamental mode.
  
But in my case, it did work for fundamental mode buffers too. Why did it work when the documentation says it should not have worked? Or the documentation does not say that and I am misunderstanding something?

 I am trying to correct a problem with a theme I am using. As you can see, the next character in the list of options is practically invisible.
 But I don't have any idea where to start looking. I know the file from which the theme is being loaded, and I can modify it. But there are sooo many definitions that I have no idea which one is the one being used.
 What would be the best way to identify the theme class used by this text?
 (by the way, this problem started with my last update to prelude, which I use. I am also using the leuven theme, which I load after prelude).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This has been an issue for a while, and I hope someone can tell me what's really going on. I use transient-mark-mode and normally it works great. But once in a while it gets "wedged", where the region doesn't deactivate properly after something that should deactivate it. As a concrete example, if I mark a region and hit delete, the region is removed, but not deactivated. So if I move the point, it expands the region again, leaving the mark where it was. And if I just start typing, I only get the last letter, as each letter replaces the previous. The only way I've found to fix this is to exit emacs and restart it.
 Ideally, I'd like to figure out what setting gets "bumped" that makes this happen, and prevent it. Failing that, a way to correct it short of not using TMM would be nice. In the worst case, knowing what triggers it so I can maybe avoid it would be better than where I am now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! Some time ago I published my very first couple of packages, both of them related to note-taking. Having essentially used them for a rather long time, they have proven to be very useful to me and I wanted to share them with you.
 I did not want to write here when I published them, to try and fix any bugs or problems that would arise by their new bundled form, but they seem to be working properly so... here they are:
  
KLP is a general package, focusing solely on making the consistent naming as easy as possible, with a note_category_title.org, template. This allows for arbitrary categories to be easily defined, built and search through. Some use cases for it would be cheatsheet files, easily accessible notes on cli tools ... generally static notes.
 Org-lectures. Now this one, even though it shares quite a lot of elements with KLP (it was developed almost simultaneously) allows for the easy creation and management of courses and lectures files. By assigning a couple of keybindings and complementing it with a package like CDLatex or Yasnippets, a really fun workflow was created that allows me to take (in real time) lecture notes for my university courses.
  
Feel free to try them!
 P.S. My experience in writing packages is limited, so any feedback would be more than welcome (this is the reason why I decided to post here after all, :P). Literate programming files also exist in their respective repos, allowing for easier understanding of these simple packages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have searched online, but this is the best I could come up with, I'm not sure if it is correct, please correct these definitions.
  
seq :: a → b → b
 Evaluates first argument to weak head normal form (WHNF), when that is completed only then the second argument is returned (ensure arg1 is completed before proceeding with arg2).
 
pseq :: a → b → b
 
 Evaluates first argument to WHNF however does so in parallel using spark, when that is done the second argument is evaluated..
  
par :: a → b → b
  
Evaluates first and second arg in parallel, with hope that arg1 will be fully evaluated by the time its result is needed. It is useful in cases where the evaluation of first arg is expensive and is acceptable to delay its result until later.
 ​
 Now consider this quicksort algorithm:
 import Control.Parallel (par, pseq) 
 parSort (x:xs) = greater ‘par‘ (lesser ‘pseq‘ (lesser ++ x:greater)) 
 where lesser = parSort [y | y <- xs, y < x] 
 greater = parSort [y | y <- xs, y >= x] parSort _ = []
 It will be almost as (in)efficient as the sequential version:
 sort :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a] sort (x:xs) = lesser ++ x:greater
 where lesser = sort [y | y <- xs, y < x]
 greater = sort [y | y <- xs, y >= x] sort _ = []
 Why is that?

 I've recently updated my emacs to v29 --with-native-comp and I noticed that now when I do C-h f -> consult-grep for example I'm getting the doc for that function as expected but the link to the source code where the function is defined leads to my packages.el file where I use use-package to install consult. 
 I just checked and I have similar issue with projectile functions too.
 the message says:
 projectile-grep is an autoloaded interactive native-compiled Lisp function in ‘../../packages.el’
 There is no such issue with variables defined by projectile or consult. The issue is there for some packages and for some not. For example orderless functions have no such issue and the doc points to orderless.el as expected. php-mode is fine. Magit has the issue. 
 Have you noticed anything like that in your setup? Is it native-comp related? Is there any way to guide Emacs so it knows where definitions are? It seems like Emacs knows that let's say projectile-grep is there, it knows the docstring as well. But for some reason it just points to wrong file. 
 Just for some additional info: - I'm on MacOS - I use emacs-plus@29 compiled with brew - I use use-package with straight
 Any idea on how to solve it is highly appreciated. Thanks

 I suppose, that creating mock by hand (not using macro) will fix the issue, but is there any other way?

 For example, I want emacs to be able to resize photoshop or final cut pro.
 I haven't found anything on how to do that on Windows, Mac and ChromeOS.
 Does something already exist to do so?

I tried adding (setq python-shell-interpreter "/path/to/python3") to my init.el and setting my environment variables within Emacs and all of the other suggestions I found online, but still kept receiving the error. I even tried creating an alias for python in my .bashrc and calling emacs from the command line. 
 I finally solved the problem by creating a symlink to python: ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python Hopefully if someone else encounters this issue and searches for a solution, they find this post and it works for them as well.

 Side question: Should I just drop pdf-tools from my packages? I have a love hate relationship with it, on one side it is very useful to have all of my pdf files in Emacs, but at the same time scrolling is not smooth and it has a lot of quirks like zoom reset when changing pages or getting stuck on a page. :/

 ​
 - I run a command (`display_run_stack` or something), and a new window opens with `run_stack` displayed in a special readonly buffer. Each entry of `run_stack` should be one line.
 - Each element of `run_stack` is a struct with a `uuid` field. When point is over a given entry, pressing Enter calls a function (`goto_uuid`) on that uuid.
 ​
 The thing I have in mind is something like Org Agenda. Any advice how to program this? Kind of a noob wrt emacs application programming. Not sure where to even start. Example code from some other project would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Long time lurker here but first time poster.
 I thought this community might be interested in my dissertation. It’s an evaluation of effect systems / design patterns in pure functional languages, from first principles. It operates at the intersection of the academic literature and real world software development. Haskell was the most obvious language for this task, so I used a small program involving four key effects: environment, state, errors and I/O.
 A lot of my time was spent trying to understand the history of the domain and drawing out the most important criteria for working programmers. In the end I settled on: expressiveness, modularity, extensibility, ergonomics and performance. These are the basis for the comparison.
 I don’t expect anyone to have the time to read the whole thing, so this post summarises some of the key take aways: https://www.dantb.dev/posts/dissertation
 I also compiled a list of my favourite resources (there should be a few familiar names from this subreddit… 🙂): https://www.dantb.dev/posts/effects-bibliography
 This evaluation may be useful for people wanting to understand the trade offs involved in selecting tools and techniques in pure functional languages. This was one of my personal goals for the project, as someone who has used pure FP in Scala for several years but never went deep on the theory before. I saw a bit of a gap in the literature regarding the application of these design patterns from the perspective of a software developer, which is what I’m most interested in.
 The structure is broadly chronological and a lot of it is probably old news for experienced Haskellers. With that in mind, I'd highlight Chapter 7 which contrasts extensible effects with the earlier approaches.
 Comments are open 🙂

Unsure why. when I use helm-run-external-command I'm able to launch without problem but its a litttle roundabout and creates it's own buffer which is annoying

 I had to sprinkle in some more lazy until it didn't produce stack overflows anymore.
  
Edit 1: When I write lazy val sum the forward reference error goes away and an infinite-loop warning appears. When I write that: => Parser[T2] instead of that: Parser[T2], that warning goes away as well. I'm going to report back and see if it works with an implementation!
 The problem is that I don't really know what I'm doing. I just understand that in Haskell, everything is lazy and in Java, everything is eager evaluation, besides stuff like &&, which I guess works "lazily" in Java as …]]></summary>

  (let ((default-font (pcase system-type ('gnu/linux "Liberation Mono 16") ('darwin "Avenir 16") ((or 'windows-nt 'cygwin) "Corbel 16") (_ "Verdana 16")))) (cond ((find-font (font-spec :name "Fira Code")) (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font .

"DejuVu Sans Mono 16"))) (t (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist `(font . ,default-font))) ) ) 
 However, instead, Liberation Mono is set to be the font for some reason. I thought that find-font would return a list if a font is found, which is truthy, but that doesn't appear to be the case. And yes, I'm sure that Fira Code is installed properly:
 (find-font (font-spec :name "Fira Code")) -> #<font-entity ftcrhb CTDB Fira\ Code nil iso10646-1 regular normal normal 0 nil 100 0 ((:font-entity "/usr/share/fonts/truetype/firacode/FiraCode-Regular.ttf" . 0) (:name . "Fira Code"))> 
 The output below the elisp snippet is what I get when I evaluate it.

 Is there a similar Emacs package to convert from text to professional-looking directed diagrams like decision trees?
 I searched Google, Reddit and Emacs SE and the best I encountered was:
  
graph.el - converts a difficult to parse elisp lists to a similarly difficult to read text diagram.
 a bunch of packages for converting org docs to diagrams of various sorts, none of which were quite suitable for making arbitrary directed diagrams.
  
My hope is my google-fu has failed me and there is a great package I've missed. Also open to non-Emacs suggestions that could be integrated into Emacs with some work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use doom emacs and am having an issue tracking down a key binding.
 While in insert mode, I like to use C-h as a binding for backspace since it is more ergonomic. However, while in org-mode, C-h seems to be bound to org-beginning-of-line.
 In order to find out why C-h was behaving this way, here's what I did:
  
Open a .org file
 Enter insert mode
 Type M-SPC h k C-h
 This takes me to the documentation for org-beginning-of-line
  
Here's where it gets weird:
 Under "Key Bindings", it only has:
 org-mode-map C-a org-mode-map s-<left> 
 ... no binding for C-h! But that's the key I pressed to get to this help page!
 Why does C-h not show up here? Where did this binding even come from? How do I override it?
 I've tried doing:
 (map! :after org :map org-mode-map :i "C-h" #'backward-delete-char) 
 ... but this doesn't seem to override the binding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use doom emacs and am having an issue tracking down a key binding.
 While in insert mode, I like to use C-h as a binding for backspace since it is more ergonomic. However, while in org-mode, C-h seems to be bound to org-beginning-of-line.
 In order to find out why C-h was behaving this way, here's what I did:
  
Open a .org file
 Enter insert mode
 Type M-SPC h k C-h
 This takes me to the documentation for org-beginning-of-line
  
Here's where it gets weird:
 Under "Key Bindings", it only has:
 org-mode-map C-a org-mode-map s-<left> 
 ... no binding for C-h! But that's the key I pressed to get to this help page!
 Why does C-h not show up here? Where did this binding even come from? How do I override it?
 I've tried doing:
 (map! :after org :map org-mode-map :i "C-h" #'backward-delete-char) 
 ... but this doesn't seem to override the binding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[static-ls is a low memory language server for Haskell that serves as an alternative to hls with less functionality by using statically generated information. It is intended for (Highly recommend hls instead if you aren't having these issues):
  
enterprise sized projects that are either too large or make extensive use of template Haskell leading to high memory usage for hls
 for machines with too little memory where hls can end up using too much memory
  
and provides a small subset of haskell language server's functionality namely:
  
Type on hover
 Find references
 Go-to definition
  
Future features I'd like to implement include: - Haddock documentation on hover from interface files - Diagnostics from ghcid - Autocomplete in scope from hiedb
 It has been tested it on a codebase with over 180,000 LOC and works relatively stably. With a combination of ghcid, an hiedb filewatcher and the -fdefer-type-errors flag you can get pretty solid IDE behavior. Currently only ghc 9.4.4 is supported but happy to personally help people set this up if interested!
 Any feedback is appreciated!

 The problem occurs when using pandoc or org-export. Anyone have any idea how I can fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce the 0.4.0.0 release of generic-persistence! Here is the Hackage Link.
 generic-persistence is a Haskell persistence layer for relational databases. The approach relies on GHC.Generics. The actual database access is provided by the HDBC library.
 New things in this release:
  
A query DSL
 Connection pooling
 A fail safe API that uses Either to safely return all database runtime errors
  
changes:
  
all retrieve* functions have been renamed to select*
 the function retrieveAll was removed. Selection of all entries os a table can now be done with select conn allEntries
  
All new features and changes are documented in the tutorial.
 I've also created a sample project that demonstrates how to build a Servant REST service using generic-persistence for database access.
 All Feedback, bug reports and pull requests are welcome!

 I wonder how the objects are represented so that rules can allow or filter an event.
 I wanted to learn Haskell and give this problem a try; I am thinking in terms of identifying sensitive information in logs. For example, let's say we are looking for AWS Access keys, i.e. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
 Let's represent a rule in YAML (because not sure how it should look in Haskell) yaml access_key_violation: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: f…]]></summary>

this is a new idea of mine that I don't understand well yet:
The value of a position in chess consists of its probability of victory for the player. Moves are evaluated according to how they affect this probability of victory.
We can apply this to our thinking: knowledge-based value creation consists of enriching data, information, and pre-existing knowledge with value-giving properties. Value-giving properties include: Accuracy/Completeness, Reliability, and Usefulness.
An evaluation of thinking would look like this:1

 I'm kind of a newbie on configuring emacs, so here is the context:
 I decided to install cmake-ide. It seems that rtags came along with the former. Fine, but I also decided to use the vertico package. It also seems that rtags has a support for Helm, but from what I understand, Helm and and Vertico fall under the same category of packages and therefore I can only have one of them.
 I found this friendly tutorial on how to install cmake-ide and I'm pretty satisfied with the customization used in it. I thought that by omit the helm line in the config scope and by changing (setq rtags-display-result-backend 'helm) to vertico would workout with my configuration, but it failed.
 So my question is: is it possible to combine vertico and rtags to work simultaneously?

 Often times with niche languages, it's easy to get a job despite the total amount of jobs being limited. If no one is applying, the competition is pretty weak or nonexistent. 
 I've seen that many jobs in Haskell are in the healthcare sector. It seems to be pretty standard enterprise stuff that likely was done with Java at some point in the past. 
 Are these jobs, or Haskell jobs (non-research) in general competitive?
 If you were rating the difficulty of getting a job in Haskell as a self-taught programmer on a scale of 1-10 (with 1 being a webdev at a no-name website and 10 being a FAANG job), where would you put Haskell jobs?

 (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist `(,(rx bos (or "*cider-repl" "*nrepl-server" "*cider-test-report*" "*cider-error" "*cider-result")) (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-direction) (direction . right) (window . root) (dedicated . nil) ;; (window-preserve-size . (t . t)) ;; (window-width . 0.30) )) 
 Now, you can see that I have a couple of things commented because they don't appear to work. it looks like I'm not using the right combination of display-buffer functions. Or maybe something else is wrong.
 What I want is:
  
I want buffers to appear initially on the right side with specific width (0.30 of the frame)
 If I change the position of the window, e.g., move it to the left side, I want Emacs to remember my choice, and when I bury the buffer and pop to it again, I want it to come from the left. Currently, it always pops on the right side
 The same for the width. If I change the width - I want Emacs to preserve it and the next time I pop the buffer, it should not resize the window.
  
Can someone help me tame display-buffer so it works as I want? Thank you!

Additionally ranger.el doesn't look like it's being actively maintained at the moment, 
  
 I've tried using dirvish, which has the added benefit of being recently updated. The previews seem to work nice, but (I realize this sounds crazy) there seems to be too much going on feature-wise. I keep trying to have the ranger like view with three panels, but dirvish seems to switch to a more standard dired like view despite my config. On top of this, there isn't a nice C-h to hide dotfiles and I occasionally get a Selected deleted buffer error if I want to look at a directory I've killed.
  
 Does anyone have a smooth ranger.el or dirvish setup to share, or ways of overcoming the problems I mentioned above? Or a different way to browse files that's more robust?

 I used to read functor /applicative/monad ref a lot , coud you guys comment my understanding is right on `Functor`
 fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b 
 fmap is just a funciton that :
  
describe how to extract `a` from the container `f-1`
 then run function (a -> b), to get `b`
 then describe how to plug back `b` to container `f-2` ( f-2 doesn't have to be same with f-1)
  
The key is : on different types, the effect of fmap is describling how to extract parameter and how plug back the result to a container (maybe a new container with some state change as well ) ?

 https://github.com/konrad1977/emacs/blob/main/localpackages/overlay-usage.el
 Feel free to improve it.
 Swift (SourceKit-LSP Doesn't support Code-lenses, so if you have support for that for your language you're better off keeping you current solution)
 Enjoy!

 I work frequently with a (proprietary) application that uses the .Net standard serialiser. I often manually edit these files, as they also contain a DSL embedded in some of the content, that I find easier to tweak this way rather than via the application itself.
 I was considering developing a small prog mode to assist me with some or all of the following features:
  
hide most of the XML boilerplate (but retain the structure)
 display the DSL code, ideally with syntax highlighting. This code is embedded within two XML elements.
 where multiple code elements exist in an XML file, provide some mechanism to display this in a natural way
  
I'd be amazed if something similar hadn't been done previously, so I'm looking for an example or two that will provide me with a flavour of what is possible.
 Thanks

 Why is agenda not editable?
 Around a third of my workflow is going through filtered notes in a table and adding various things. This is very dynamic - I might want to suddenly have another column in the table (or remove it, or resize it), to add more information, or to not have something clutter the view.
 So far, it seems the agenda is very "set in stone", and I am going to be unable to do things on-the-fly. Only possible to spend time preparing a view, then use and re-use it.
 Is orgmode really this unflexible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I am using org-mode and org-attach via doom emacs. Whenever I have made notes and tried to attach something using either org-download-screenshot or org-download-clipboard, by default the heading has an "ATTACH" tag signifying that there is an attachment in this heading. Example shown below.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/dcx9pfdb9esa1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b453b1d160882ee09624e84c5598ec222c5f3ec
 Now when I try to export this to GFM using pandoc, this is what it does
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/2keyfcri9esa1.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=57aa82093888ea635644fcedc5be3eaf376f21f4
 Essentially it exports the ATTACH tag out. I have a couple of questions.
  
What's the purpose behind the "ATTACH" tag? The reason I ask this is because I can easily set org-attach-auto-tag to nil and this tag is not attached and therefore not exported. But does it have other consequences that I might not be aware of. Reading the documentation, it doesn't appear so, but I am then left to wonder why this would be the default behavior.
 Is there a way to keep the org-attach-auto-tag to the default value of "ATTACH" but not have it exported. I tried setting the EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS to ATTACH but then of course the whole content doesn't get exported.
  
Thanks for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking for a workflow where I'd paste images from clipboard all the time. I figured I could do it with the org-download package like so (with use-package):
 (use-package org-download :ensure t ;; this makes sure the thing is loaded if not present :init (setq org-download-method 'attach) :config (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'org-download-enable) :bind ("C-y" . org-download-clipboard)) 
 Which works, until I try to paste text. Emacs freezes completely, and is unusable.
 I realized this also happens if I just call org-download-clipboard directly without a shortcut, when there is no pic in the immediate clipboard.
 So my question is: am I doing something wrong? Is there a simple solution here without having to use different shortcuts?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I usually don't post on Reddit, so I apologize in advance if I make some obvious mistakes. I've already asked similar question here on a different subreddit, but I was wondering if there are better solutions.
 ​
 I previously owned a Mac Book 2020 and used Emacs for editing texts. I really liked that the OS X had a global/system wide shortcut that allowed cursor move/act like in Emacs (e.g. C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p C-a, C-e, C-k). For example, I could use the Emacs move for browsers (Chrome/Firefox), File Manager, etc.
 However, I recently had to return my Mac, and purchased a Steam Deck which has a Arch Linux like OS called SteamOS, which does not have the Emacs movements enabled globally/system wide.
 I tried to configure cursor movements/actions similar to the Emacs moves via KDE Custom Shorcut (details of how I configured can be seen here), but this solution does conflict with several applications, and I have a feeling that there might be a better solution.
 By any chance, does anyone know how to configure non-Mac OS (in my case SteamOS/Arch Linux) to have shortcuts similar to the Emacs in a global/system wide manner?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How has your week been? What are your plans for the coming week? Tell us about the state of you zettelkasting journey.
My week has been busy with medical issues that prevented me from making many new notes. I feel good now. 
I got my first two essays back from the professor in my food writing class, and I feel good about them. I am of a different generation than everyone else in the class, including the instructor. There are a couple of writers in the class that seem to be able to write a first draft of a 'writing prompt exercise' that is far more polished than my 'shitty first drafts'. They are modeling a skill that I aspire to.
While journaling this morning, I found a gem in an entry from one year ago today. It's very meta, and this is all very circular.

  
Zettelkasting and journaling are like workouts. You have a busy day ahead. Why journal? Journaling is not just another task. At first, you stumble with form.  Like when you are a beginner at weight training, you struggle with repeatedly getting to the gym. You think it will help your physical health, but at first, you feel sore, tight, and tired, not at all the pinnacle of health. Eventually, if you stick with it, you might find a coach that helps with form, you might set up your environment so going to the gym feels natural, you might start to feel strength building, and you've started progressing on the climb to physical health.
All these weight training actions can be applied to zettelkasting and journaling. They train your mental health in the same way exercise trains your physical health. It's a slow process at first. You can't see the improvements day to day or even week to week. Improvement only comes with consistency.


I think I'll move this gem from my journal to my ZK. I have a couple of relevant notes on the mental health benefits of journaling.

 I'd like to support a couple of Emacs maintainers but I'm not sure to whom and how much.
 For example I can choose the maintainers of my favourite packages and transfer some money on a regular basis. Is it okay to support many maintainers with less money or should I support few maintainers with more money? Or should I support FSF in general?
 I'm thinking of $50 per month. So, should I give 10 maintainers $5 per month or 5 maintainers $10?
 I will find an answer for myself but I'm interesting of how do you handle it.
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Emacs 28 with tree-sitter.el. I'm trying to extract import-statements from C sources, and fail miserably.
 I can see the node tree using tree-sitter-debug-mode. But when playing around with queries - either interactively with tree-sitter-query-builder or with code (see below) - I don't get any results.
 My code looks like this, and runs:
  (tsc-query-matches (tsc-make-query tree-sitter-require 'c) [(preproc_include)]) (tsc-root-node tree-sitter-tree) #'ts--buffer-substring-no-properties) 
 The result is  [(0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . [])] 
 Which makes sense given the actual 6 include statements I have in the source file. But apparently no actual contents are extracted. Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey.
 I'm just getting started with emacs, and I can't even really start because of errors. Please help me stay here.
 I tried the debian package. It is bugged to say the least, and I found out quite quickly (see https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cdei4p/failed_to_download_gnu_archive_bad_request/)I decided to install a newer version, as described by emacswiki (ganneff.de)https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsSnapshotAndDebian
 ​
 When apt was installing it, it would throw a much of eager-macro-expansion failure lines, something like
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 5) 
 When running it, everything seemed fine, but, when I open a .org file, it throws
 (New file) File mode specification error: (error Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)) 
 It does not do this if I run it with emacs -Q.
 Someone with a similar issue was https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/74421/eager-macro-expansion-failure-message-when-starting-emacs-28-2-from-the-mac-te , however, there is no fix there that worked for me
 HOME=/tmp emacs 
 ^^ This still produces the error, even with an empty tmp.
 sudo apt remove --autoremove emacs emacs-common emacs-gtk 
 ^^ I did run this before installing the new one.
 Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you.
 ​
 EDIT: I tried deleting everything again, and installed the snap package. Same issue. There must be something leftover I'm guessing from those past emacs.

 [EDIT] After using yantar92's advice and folding before/after, I managed to get closer to the expected look:

 But there is still space between them, although now it's not really a breaking issue.

It is mentioned in several places that there were dos versions of hugs or hbc, but all the links (many pointint to universities FTPs) are broken. Some are so obscure that even archive.org did not deign to make a copy. 
 I found the source code of hbc for linux. Attemps to compile it with djgpp failed.
 So is there somewhere one can get a dos version of haskell these days?

 (use-package copilot :straight (:host github :repo "zerolfx/copilot.el" :files ("dist" "*.el")) :ensure t :bind (:map copilot-mode-map ("<tab>" . my/copilot-tab) ("s-n" . copilot-next-completion) ("s-p" . copilot-previous-completion) ("s-w" . copilot-accept-completion-by-word) ("s-l" . copilot-accept-completion-by-line)) :config (defun my/copilot-tab () (interactive) (or (copilot-accept-completion) (indent-for-tab-command))) :hook (prog-mode . copilot-mode)) 
 I had been using corfu and cape for completions with Tabnine (another code analyzer thing.) After disabling these I get the expected suggestions from copilot, appearing as grayed out code that I can accept with <TAB>.
 I'd like to get the sort of experience shown in the gif at the zerolfx/copilot.el github page. Short completions pop up in an overlay - I don't know if they are multiple suggestions from copilot or coming from another backend - and copilot suggestions appear in gray for acceptance.
 But if I re-enable corfu/cape/Tabnine I only see the overlaid completions, and don't get copilot suggestions.
 I don't have a good understanding of how corfu does it's thing or how I can integrate copilot's suggestions.
 How should I progress?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am currently using evil and corfu, but I want to configure such that pressing a single escape will invoke corfu-quit when its UI is active (because pressing "C-g" is harder).
 The problem: even after
 elisp (define-key corfu-map [escape] #'corfu-quit) ;; yes, I think that won't be usable in terminal Emacs but (kbd "ESC") will ;; complicate a bunch of other "M-" keys 
 In evil insert state, pressing ESC will always invoke evil-normal-state even when corfu's UI is displaying. Thus the above snippet is fine without evil, otherwise the key will bring me back to normal state without discarding the popup completion list.
 Can someone tell me how to take over evil in some circumstances such as the above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given: 
 type Image a = Position -> a
 type Position = (Float, Float)
 type Region = Image Boolean
 We would like to create a function that replaces the values of one image with another using paste.
 paste :: Region -> Image a -> Image a -> Image a
 paste reg im1 im2 = (\p -> if (reg p) then (im1 p) else (im2 p))
 My question is where does p come from? paste takes 3 parameters reg, im1 and im2. So where does p come from? When using lambda in Javascript for example myList.map(x => x+5), it's clear that x is a value from myList. But here I get a little bit confused as to where p comes from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to list the Org mode apps available and summarize their flaws, harshly. I won't have gripes about not supporting obscure Org syntax, or anything like that. Instead, can it read and write Org files? Trickier than you think.
  
Organice - It can't access files from your phone's filesystem, something that should be simple, but it's difficult for a web app. You have to store your notes in 3rd party clouds like Dropbox or connect your own WebDAV server.
 Orgro : read only
 Orgzly - The most featureful. An unfortunate mechanism that can't be turned off saves over your file with re-done spacing -- blank lines are added between headlines automatically, which isn't Org specification nor everyone's style. This clogs git, if you're using version control, with changes that are just whitespace. One may notice a toggle to turn off adding blank lines between headlines, but that just means turning blank lines off entirely, forgetting ones that you may have added. Fundamentally, as of now, Orgzly's parser doesn't try to remember the blank lines in your notes that you may have added with purpose.
 Metanote A newcomer, but it has stayed proprietary.
  
I have more hopes about are full-fledged Emacs with termux or Emacs on F-Droid. None of the org mode apps today are very usable.

 Using C u C c p s s give an option prompt in the minibuffer where you add the flags you want, -w in this case but that didn't work.

 In the worst case I could add a hook on buffer creation that checks if the buffer belongs to a project that looks 'Rust-ish' (contains a Cargo.toml at project root or whatever) and binds the relevant keys, but I don't want to duplicate effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs 29 has got new startup options: --init-directory. Here is how you can use it (for those daredevils who build their own Emacs, until 29 is finalized):
 In your shell, clone those repo(s) you would like to test:
 git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs git clone https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude git clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax 
 You can now run your Emacs from command line in respective directory:
 emacs --init-directory=~/spacemacs& emacs --init-directory=~/prelude& emacs --init-directory=~/scimax& 
 Easy. 
 I actually never tried anyone's setup before, but always had on my to-do to actually try those (+ Doom, but Doom seems to require slightly more fiddling). As a small review: Spacemacs and Prelude worked out of the box without any issues. Scimax is a bit older, and for some reason, it choked a bit during the installation. I had to press C-g once or twice to get it going. Also, every time Emacs starts, it is chewing on something until I press C-g. I haven't investigated on what. But other than that, despite all the warnings during the package installation, it seems to work quite well. I am impressed with the amount of polish and integration all three has done. I can certainly recommend any, especially Scimax for those of you who are doing lots of org, org-babel and who write scientific articles and reports. Spacemacs seems to be the most polished of them the three, visually and technically, while Scimax seems to be actually most useful, especially if you are an academic.
 If you are new to Emacs and learning, it is not worth spending hours chasing packages and configuring stuff. Install Emacs, and you can be going solidly in less than five minutes with any of those three. Probably Doom to, but can't be just cloned and auto-installed via provided init.el as those three guys.

 I am trying GNU Emacs both on a Mac and a Windows PC. On the Mac, inserting a date with C-c ! shows [2023-04-04 Tue]. On Windows, it shows [2023-04-04 di]. Both machines have current-language-environment set to "Dutch". The rest is mostly out of the box.
 It looks like Windows is properly detecting my locale, but the Mac isn't.
 I want to use my local language ("di") instead of English ("Tue").
 What am I missing in setting this up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using embark for some months now, I like it, I like the concept, the way it works, and it's already part of my workflow in a number of tasks. On the other hand I also find it somewhat overwhelming. The keymaps are very large, and comprise numerous tasks which could potentially be performed through Embark. As a result, unless the binding is already part of muscle memory, having to resort to the embark-verbose-indicator is a time consuming step, because the list is so long it feels like finding a binding in C-h m. True, C-h offers completion, but at this point I'm already wondering if it wouldn't have been faster doing the task without using Embark.
 So, it works very well for bindings I know by heart. Which are a few. For others, I can't help but feel I'd prefer to have less alternatives. Thus, I'm considering adopting a "bottom-up" approach to Embark. The idea would be drastically reducing the available Embark bindings, and then adding the ones for which I feel the need. The question is: is there a "proper" way to go about this? I don't think nuking embark-keymap-alist to just a few maps is the way to go, since the keymaps put the bindings in the proper context. But, on the other hand, going around disabling each binding seems tedious. So, any advice on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep track of certain reports in an org file and need to record the date the report was submitted. I use a property "REPORT_DATE" for this and then call org-time-stamp-inactive from the minibuffer in order to pass the value of the property in the desired format. 
 I am looking for a way to streamline this process, so that when I call org-set-property and select REPORT_DATE, I don't have to manually call org-time-stamp-inactive, but instead I'm just prompted to select a date (i.e. a way for org-time-stamp-inactive to be called when I select the property REPORT_DATE via org-set-property). 
 I realize I could define a wrapper that would do much of what I need (prompt for a date and then call org-set-property with REPORT_DATE and the formatted output of org-time-stamp-inactive as arguments), but I'm wondering if this is necessary.
 I've looked into allowed values but, from what I can tell, I can only specify a list of values, which isn't quite what I need.
  
EDIT: this does the trick. 
 (defun org-completing-read-date (prompt collection &optional predicate require-match initial-input hist def inherit-input-method) "Like `completing-read' but reads a date and outputs an inactive time-stamp. Only PROMPT and DEF are really used." (format "[%s]" (org-read-date nil nil nil prompt nil def))) (add-to-list 'org-property-set-functions-alist '("REPORT_DATE" . org-completing-read-date))

 Notable changes:
  
better performance
 using experimental features will now produce an appropriate warning, which can be disabled with the --suppress-experimental-warning option or the suppress-warning.experimental-features global configuration key
 experimental and restricted configuration keys are now only available in the --power mode
 deprecated using directive syntax has been dropped (multiline directives and others)
 and more, refer to the release notes for details

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a while since I last posted a post regarding Eask. So I would like to share some of the significant changes since v0.1.0.
 For those who don't know Eask, you can treat Eask as a successor to Cask.
 Project repository: https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli
 🎉 Features
  
Unlike Cask-file, Eask-file is an elisp file. You can manage dependencies with elisp code like:
  
elisp (when (version< emacs-version "26.3") (depends-on "package-name")) 
  
Node.JS is not required to use Eask; you can download the binary at our release page
 Out-of-the-box linters and test runners (checkdoc, package-lint, ert, buttercup, elsa, etc)
 Work across all OSs (Unless Node.js doesn't support it :P)
 Automatically download packages when they are used
 Fast, won't start Emacs unless it's needed
  
✨ Changes
  
Eask now has all the commands from Cask and more (If Cask works, then Eask works)
 eask status to display the state of the workspace (eask info is also cool! :D)
 Convert Cask-file to Eask-file using eask init --from=cask
 eask generate workflow [action] to generate workflow files (support GitHub Actions, GitLab Runner, CircleCI, etc)
 eask generate [type] to generate common files like-pkg.el, -autoloads.el, LICENSE, .gitignore, etc.
 eask cat to display file with highlighting (uses e2ansi)
 Differentiate workspace with flag --global and --config, so you can use Eask as either a general tool or package management tool for your personal configuration
 eask create [type] creates elisp project (package or ELPA)
 webinstall is now available, install it with curl!

 I'm working on using MobileOrg with webdav, but it only works partialy: 1. "captures" works, the content can be sync'ed back and forth 2. but the outlines are not working, I set up the url to be something like =http://host/org/index.org= and it links to a foo.org, both .org files have a line in =checksums.dat= Every time I click "sync", it seems ok but the foo.org is not fetched, the outlines panel is blank. And MobileOrg didn't try to fetch it, as I observed with tcpdump.
 What could be wrong? How can I troubleshoot the problem? The MobileOrg version is 1.7.5
 Thanks in advance.
 P.S. I submitted an issue at https://github.com/MobileOrg/mobileorg/issues/290, but nobody responded yet, so I re-post it here to see if someone here knows how to fix it.

systems that foster cross-team communication. Using a monorepo is an excellent
way to do that. A monorepo provides:
Visibility: by seeing the pull requests (PRs) of colleagues, you are easily informed
of what other teams are doing.
Uniformity: by working in one central repository, it is easier to share
the configuration of linters, formatters, etc. This makes it easy
to use the same code style and documentation standards.
Uniformity smooths the onboarding of newcomers as well as the reassignment of engineers
to different internal projects.
Easier continuous integration: new code is picked
up automatically by CI, without any manual interaction, ensuring uniformity and best practices.

 The syntax here is that prod represents a DPT, [1..n] represents a set of integers from 1 to n. x.B is a type function with argument x. I am trying to calculate the number of elements of the resulting type. 
 Although I understand the concept of DPTs I don't actually understand how they work in practise i.e. this example. My guess is that the cardinality of the resulting type is 6, (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,1) (3,2) and (3,3). Can anyone give a better explanation of how this works?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was going to quickly write some complex computations and took a look at the source code for Data.Complex just to see what tools I get out of the box. Many of the formulas are what you would expect like:
 sin (x:+y) = sin x * cosh y :+ cos x * sinh y 
 But the instances make no sense at all:
 instance Monad Complex where a :+ b >>= f = realPart (f a) :+ imagPart (f b) instance Applicative Complex where pure a = a :+ a f :+ g <*> a :+ b = f a :+ g b 
 I'm not seeing how the bind definition works at all. f is going to return a real and complex number when applied to both a and b so you are going to have to scramble. Moreover unless f is linear there is no reason to believe that f(a +ib) = f(a) + i*f(b). It would seem to me a much more reasonable assumption would be to use numerical methods and compute a Taylor expansion for real a and then extend to b. That's still highly questionable but at least don't fail for functions as simple as f x = x^2. Similarly the definition for pure makes no sense at all.
 Haskell normally doesn't get obvious math wrong so I'm assuming the fault lies with me. What am I missing?

This would autocomplete parentheses and allow me to work comfortably with s-exps. Just turning on lispy mode causes some annoying behavior in the repl. Specifically, if im typing

 and point is at . then pressing ENTER evaluates the form, rather than inserting a new line. Maybe I set this up wrong or the lispy package doesnt interact nicely with sly?

 -- in ModuleB import ModuleA
 fun :: arg -> X a
 newtype Y a = Y (ReaderT Bool X a) deriving (...Monad)
 funY :: arg1 -> Y a ```
 What I would like to achieve is to replace usage of concrete type X with a (constrained) abstract type without touching code in ModuleB - shadowing ModuleA import with a Cabal mixin.
 I tried: ``` class ApiX m where ...
 type X a = forall m. (ApiX m) => m a ```
 It almost works - except newtype Y a above. Compilation fails with the message that X is partially applied. Note that this already exists in ModuleB and the goal is not to touch source code in this module.
 Is there any way to achieve that (using type families or whatever)?
 EDIT: The end goal is to make all functions defined in ModuleB polymorphic without touching any code in this module. In other words transform all functions from
 f :: a -> b -> c -> X d
 to
 f :: ApiX m => a -> b -> c -> m d

However, even when I include a non-breaking space (C-x 8 SPC), commands like forward-sentence and backward-sentence will still stop on those.
 My sentence-end variable is nil, so according to the sentence-end function, the value will come from the variables ‘sentence-end-base’, ‘sentence-end-double-space’, ‘sentence-end-without-period’ and ‘sentence-end-without-space’. I've checked all of them, and the only one that seems to be pertaining is sentence-end-base, which says:
  
Its value is "[.?!…‽][]\"'”’)}»›]*" 
 Regexp matching the basic end of a sentence, not including following space.
  
It doesn't say anything about distinguishing spaces from non-breaking spaces. Any clues on how to change this behavior?
 Also, can you see any unintended consequences of the setup I'm planning to use (one space after sentences, one non-breaking space after things that should not be ending sentences)?

My concrete example of yesterday was a compact hex-representation of some joystick input data. I discovered recently the highlight-functionality, and that has already been super helpful in making visibly distinct marks in long logfiles.
 I know that Emacs can do overlays (and I know that they are costly), so I wonder if anybody is aware of something like svg-annotate/git blame where for each line I get an annotation of the meaning of that line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realized a while back that it should be pretty easy to write an unordered split function for the pqueue package.
 splitU :: Int -> MinQueue a -> (MinQueue a, MinQueue a) 
 splitU n q divides q into a priority queue of size min n (size q) and a priority queue of size max 0 (size q - n). I believe this can be achieved in amortized time O(log(min(n,|q|))) and worst case time O(log(max(n,|q|))) by operating in a manner analogous to binary subtraction. Which elements end up in which priority queue would be largely arbitrary. Would such an operation be useful for anything in practice? I haven't been able to think of anything, but I really want to have a reason to write this ;-).
 Edit: those bounds are wrong, but the real ones are still logarithmic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a printed book to read after finishing with Manning Publication's Get Programming with Haskell.
 Some things to consider are that, though I can't say for sure why, I don't like this book. I think the issue is that it's light. Not just verbose, but lacking in substance. Since it isn't entirely vapid and having paid money for it, I will finish the book. It's just anemic. And the capstone projects are fun.
 Two books which worked well for me are Manning's The Joy of Clojure 2nd Ed. and PragProg's Programming Clojure 3rd Ed. This is of particular significance since at least 90% of the first seven chapters of The Joy of Clojure are redundant with Programming Clojure, which I read first. I feel like I'm getting less from reading Get Programming with Haskell than I did reading content I had already covered in another book. The content just isn't there.
 (Also, it's worth noting that the code examples are kind of crappy. I'm finding myself refactoring this "expert's" code because it's ugly and horribly redundant. One thing I like about Haskell is that it's beautiful, with minimal boilerplate, and code I write in Haskell looks great to me. I don't like looking at unsightly code, and his code is mostly that. But for the sake of learning, I can look beyond that.)
 So, with this in mind, what might /r/Haskell recommend as a second Haskell book?
 Edit: I should probably mention (admit?) that I am not a programmer, and if you exclude my Numerical Analysis textbook from grad school, those two Clojure books are the only programming books I've read. I have been programming at some level for decades, but I don't have a typical CompSci background. (Which may or may not be a good thing since it does also mean I don't need to unlearn OOP.)

 However, the EWS url returns a 401 when an attempt is made to access it. Increasing the verbosity of the logging from request ((setq request-log-level 'blather)) allows us to see that basic auth is being attempted against the https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Services.wsdl url.
 This article would indicate that Basic Auth is no longer supported: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/basic-authentication-deprecation-in-exchange-online-september/ba-p/3609437
 I think this means that Excorporate can no longer authenticate with O365 as a result.

 It initially starts up with a tiny, tiny font size, so I managed to set up a one line .emacs to increase the font size, so it is at least readable.

 But once I selected a new agenda view, the buffer I was editing regained focus.
 So the answer is, just press C-c a and then choose the new view you want.
 --
 Original post:
 Let's say I'm in the week view of the Agenda (C-c a a) and I want to go to the view of my to-dos.
 I could press q to quit the week view, then press C-c a t.
 Is that the quickest way? I was wondering if there is a way to go "back" from an agenda view to the dispatcher, or to "switch" from one agenda view to another without quitting the agenda view entirely.
 I'm sorry if this is documented somewhere. I've looked in the manual and online and I'm coming up blank.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having a problem with byte-compiling a package that uses defhydra.
 The package defines a hydra only if the hydra package is available, but since it's a macro, it expands during byte-compilation and some users see "void-variable" error when trying to use the package.
 The relevant code looks like this:
 (when (require 'hydra nil :noerror) (defhydra powerthesaurus-hydra ...)) 
 The idea is not to explicitly depend on hydra (or transient), but still define such interfaces if the corresponding package is available.
 I tried using eval-after-load and with-eval-after-load, but no luck there.
 I'd really appreciate any advice or approach to try. Thanks!

I'm doing a literature review as part of a phd, so academic level critique needed.  The referencing I can easily cite at the end of the note so that isn't a concern. Does one research paper produce many notes, how does one title these notes please?  Is it the concept or the book etc.  thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,  newbie here.  I'm not overly confident or comfortable with notion, have seen hypernotes that seems easier for me, however I've been using Notion for a while.  I like notion as I can directly link out to a google doc.  I've sort of constructed the page to use notion and files embedded as if it were scrivener.  I digress.  I am writing a phd.  I do a lot of literature reviews etc.
My question here is there really much value in having a tool that presents a map of notes as per obsidian.  If I build my zettelkasten in notion which is basically a relational database is this not sufficient.  I do really want to concentrate on writing.  As notion supports my writing very well the idea of having the zettel database in the same tool is appealing to me.
Any thoughts please?
thank you Zoe]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I was planning to use org-agenda to empty my head of the (long-term) tasks that keep bothering me to focus better on the present. However, one requirement for whatever goal/task-planner system I wanted to use came up as having a system of "prerequisites". 
 For example, say I want to do a book/course on Advanced Calculus, then a prerequisite for that would be Basic Calculus. Now, I'd love the planner system to not show the Advanced Calculus until I complete all its prerequisites. But when I do complete all its prerequisites, I want it to automatically show the Advanced Calculus goal.
 Is this pre-provided by org-agenda? If not, could someone please suggest what modifications I might need to do in order to enable this?
 org-enforce-todo-dependencies seems relevant, but this seems to assume that one task's completion may only enable at most one other task (its parent), while I can imagine that there can be one-to-many such links.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was inspired by code metrics that was announced a few days back that shows the complexity of a function as a overlay above the function so I wrote a simple POC that uses RipGrep to shows number of references of that function signature. SourceKit-LSP that I uses for code completions doesn't support code lenses so I thought it would be nice to have something similar. 
 Now to my problem. When my overlay-usage-mode is enabled the scroll/trackpad is starting to behave extremely bad, it hangs and sometimes it scrolls back to the area over and over. Its the exactly the same behavior I get when using pixel-precision-mode in Emacs 29.x
 So I would like to get some help to fix my code, or at least some pointers in the right direction.
 I am using Emacs 29.x on MacOS on a M1 Pro Max so I got a lot of CPU power.

 (setq-default scroll-conservatively 10000) (setq-default scroll-margin 5) (pixel-scroll-precision-mode t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-use-momentum t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-mice t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-large-scroll-height 10.0) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-page t) (global-set-key (kbd "C-v") 'pixel-scroll-interpolate-down) (global-set-key (kbd "M-v") 'pixel-scroll-interpolate-up) 
 This lets me scroll smoothly with the mouse wheel as well. Only problem I've encountered is that I always scroll by the same amount, no matter the buffer size.
 There's buffers that are quite tiny, like the documentation popup that corfu provides. I can place my mouse on top of it, and smooth scroll with the mouse wheel, but it scrolls too far, and it doesn't let me see very much.
 Is there a simple way to make the scrolling dependent on the vertical height of the buffer?

 How could add ~ as elements of smartparents.

 I checked with the compiler and it gave me this one foo :: Eq a => a -> a -> a -> a
 First I thought about something like this foo :: (Eq a, Eq b) => a -> b -> a -> a
 So why does it forces x and y to be of the same type? Wouldnt the second option be more general as it gives the option of x and y being from the same or different type?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 So I've honestly been guilty of always writing notes via text on my phone but never pulling them into my Emacs 'ideas.org' file on my local file server that I can access via SSH and via Tramp Mode with a related Hydra.
 That being noted, here's the workflow of what I want to achieve:
 Desired Workflow:
  
I write an 'idea' note on my Android phone's Emacs Org Mode app
 I want the heading of the actual note to be like this (with the bulletpoints via Org Mode style to be intact):
  
```
 * Week of (Monday's date --> ex: 3-27-2023)
 ** (Title of Idea)
 *** Notes:
 (Blah blah blah my notes)
 ```
 ​
 With that in mind, can anyone point me in the right direction for a good Android phone app that does some of this heavy lifting? Also, can someone help me create the right syntax for the date insertion stuff above and format of the 'Title of Idea'? for org mode note ingestion?
 I've only done something similar for a work based todo list for ticket work, but its been a long time.
 Also, a general explanation of how I can do this process via the same Android app would be great since I have never synced notes to an actual notes file over SSH, and only did this kind of thing locally to a todo list.
 Thanks so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mainly made the switch because I wanted a tool that I can rely on for years to come (but also, Org-mode). Looking back, I have switched notebooks/editors 6 times in the past ~15 years for various reasons, either because I switched OS or the old tool could no longer satisfy my needs; it's just not sustainable and migrating contents ended up being a headache every time.
 It's only been a week, but so far, I like to think that I have found a forever home with Emacs.
 Here are some questions I have. I looked through some of the old threads but couldn't find the answer I need. Any relevant info is appreciated.
  
What are some suggested options for syncing Org-mode files across different OS platforms, preferably E2E encrypted? One combination appears to be file sync client + Cryptomator, though unsure if that'd prove to be problematic in the long term.
 
How do people keep their configs consistent across platforms (also backing them up)? Let's say that I carry around a Linux-powered laptop, but at home I switch between Windows and macOS for different purposes; each of them may have slightly different configs that correspond to the platform.
 
Is there a built-in cheatsheet of sort, or a toggle reference tool that can be customized, for a beginner to use as a reference while learning common keystrokes and commands? I have been killing by searching with apropos and then yanking to a separate org file; it works, just somewhat clunky. (Love the terminology, by the way.)
 
I plan to be using Emacs for academic purposes as well ­ drafting papers, processing data with scripts, so on and so forth. Any tools or advice that comes to mind?

 https://github.com/makingthematrix/signals3
 Signals3 is a lightweight event streaming library I made, based on code from the Android client of Wire, an end-to-end encrypted messenger. Its Android app was probably the biggest Scala project on Android in the world. I worked on it for five years, and extracting a small part of it to a separate library was one of the nicest and most productive tasks I remember from those days :)
 I released Signals3 1.0.0 two months ago. It was a direct rewrite of the old version from Scala 2.11 to Scala 3 (hence the name). The whole thing is an implementation of the observer pattern and in Wire, it helped a lot to connect different parts of the app, made it react quickly to events, and made the code pretty and readable.
 Say, you sent a request to t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I guess what I mean by "main" is that there are a decent amount of jobs in a company that specifically hire Haskell programmers for various work. I'm aware of some niche use cases of it, like Facebook's spam filter, but I wouldn't necessarily count that as a "sector."
 Are Haskell jobs reasonable to search for if you're self-taught and no degree?
 Certain Haskell jobs are obviously eliminated since it tends to be used in very math-focused areas and academic sectors.
 I'm reasonably good at Haskell, and enjoy the language more than most, so I was curious what's out there.

 It seems like there are a few different ways this could be done, but I figure someone has worked through this before. There are some open tickets in lsp-mode that discuss this.

 I've been at this Emacs stuff for a while, but only set up the Sponsors page now.
 At the moment I'm between employments, so on the odd chance the donations thing takes off (unlikely as it is), I could hold off a little longer before looking for the next job, giving that time to extra Emacs-related development.
 Please check it out, and maybe throw several bucks my way if you're so inclined. It's the thought that counts anyway.

I've only been using Emacs for roughly one year, but it has been a life changing choice. I am starting to feel that it's my editor, If I miss something I write a package for it or customize it to my will. 
 What's your approach to support open source software, and Emacs. Is it possible to donate to the core team, the ones that works with Emacs it self?
 Have a nice weekend Emacsers.

Compile times are getting longer and 2. projects are getting out of sync. I hope you can give me some advice on how we should arrange things conceptually and technically to mitigate both issues. The question is not unrelated to this one here, but involves a second library.
 Here are some core infos on our setup:
  
In one repo we have a library A with two main executables Ex1 and Ex2.
 Another repo provides a library B with an executable Ex3.
 Everything is build with stack.
 Library A defines core data types and logic and is needed for Library B and all executables.
 Ex1 makes use of almost all features of A. The subcommands of Ex1 fully live …]]></summary>

 I created a small package that some might found useful. As disclaimer: I would first point out that I'm quite new to emacs-lisp so there might be ways of doing some of this much better and much more efficient. 
 But it serves the purpose (for me at least) , I use it to create libs header and flags to my org-source blocks, using conan in the background.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lsp-bridge have a powerful remote code completion feature that does not rely on tramp. It comes with the following advantages: high-performance file synchronization, ssh tunnel for bidirectional communication, and server-side no need to install Emacs. More technical details are in here .
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/ap2fhnlme1ra1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff898954cd787a11e436f7ffe62771b59cb3d2b5
 Other highlight features of lsp-bridge compared to other Emacs lsp clients:
  
Fully asynchronous and high-performance: computationally intensive parts are all implemented in Python using asynchronous methods.
 
Out-of-the-box support for multiple LSP servers: lsp-bridge supports various LSP servers for code completion, diagnostics and fixes.
 
Seamless integration of multiple completion backends: lsp-bridge has a completion framework called ACM, which integrates lsp, TabNine, template, file path, English, Tailwind, Citre, and other completion backends. All these backends are seamless integrated.
 
 ​
 After 11 months of continuous improvement and refinement with over 84 contributors, lsp-bridge is more stable and functional than previous version.
 Welcome to try lsp-bridge.

 Using org-html-export-as-html seems to me that the filename is ignored. It is not rendered somewhere.
 From the users perspective where would you like to have that filename in the resulting HTML output? Here some ideas:
  
Display it in a tooltip (<pre title="/myapp/tests/test_myapp.py">).
 Render it in the upper right corner of the resulting codebox.
 Render it as a top/bottom caption.
  
Something else?

It is very annoying and actually I can't close it because it crash mi whole emacs for some reason. Since I'm not using emacs frames at all (at least not to show multiple buffers at once, maybe some completion tolling does use it, maybe company?), is there way to prevent any opening of new frame in emacs globally? Are there any probable consequences to this?

I can run it from the command line, but when I do M-x lsp-install-server eslint, i get the following error: LSP :: Server eslint install process failed with the following error message: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil). I don't think it's something related to my lsp config itself, because I was able to install the ts-ls server perfectly, but my lsp config is the following:
  (use-package lsp-mode :straight t :init :commands lsp :hook ( ((typescript-mode js-mode) . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :bind (:map lsp-mode-map ("TAB" . completion-at-point))) (use-package lsp-ui :straight t :commands lsp-ui-mode) (use-package lsp-ivy :straight t :commands lsp-ivy-workspace-symbol) (use-package company-lsp :straight t :commands company-lsp) 
 Thanks in advance!
 ​
 Edit: I justo found out what was happening. Eslint comes inside a .zip file and it seems emacs was trying to use the program "unzip" to ... well, unzip it. I didn't have unzip installed. So there it goes, if anyone has a similar problem, try installing unzip.

 When I have the line

 in my init.el, emacs freaks out on startup (but no errors) and what I get is emacs inside of emacs, which is entirely unusable. I suspect this is because term-mode is actually invoked during setup or something, but I could equally just be making a mistake.
 If this won't work, what is the best way to achieve this behavior (ansi-term starting in the normal state for evil)? Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SimpleX Chat is probably the first ever Haskell app that works on Android ARMv7a 32 bit CPUs. Huge thanks to u/angerman who made it possible. Now that Haskell GHC compiler support ARMv7a, I hope there will be other apps, not only on Android, that benefit from it!
 New in v4.6:
  
support for Android 8+ and ARMv7a devices!
 hidden profiles – you can hide your private chat profiles with a password.
 group / community moderation.
 improved audio/video calls - fully re-implemented in iOS to use native iOS interface for calls and improved on Android.
 reduced battery usage, particularly when sending the messages to large groups.
  
Also, since v4.5 release we added Dutch, Czech, Chinese and Spanish interface languages, thanks to the users' community and Weblate!
 See more details in this post and download the apps via the links here.
 v4.6.1-beta.0 is also already available on GitHub and in our F-Droid repo - it includes experimental support for sending files up to 1gb via XFTP (it can be enabled via Developer tools) and many fixes.
 Please ask any questions about SimpleX Chat in the comments! Some common questions:
 Why user IDs are bad for privacy?
 How SimpleX delivers messages without user profile IDs?
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc.?
 SimpleX Chat security was assessed by Trail of Bits in November 2022.

 I’d like to try DOOM for 6-8 weeks to get a taste, but I couldn’t care less about org mode or magit or integrated browsers. I just want to go about my usual Python workflow: Copilot, pyright, testing, pre-config, grepping, linting, file switching, … the usual suspects. 
 I tried VSCode and walked away because the polish didn’t seem to be there for a lot of the plug-ins. On the Vim side, we’ve got all the tpope stuff that has been around for years and is mature and nuanced.
 I judge an editor by how it performs on things I do 100s of times a day. What should I look for in Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use vertico-multiform do create key bindings on the minibuffer-local-map specific to certain commands. Some hints by minad suggest it should be possible (e.g. https://github.com/minad/vertico/issues/321#issuecomment-1399902077 and https://github.com/minad/vertico/issues/320#issuecomment-1399261079), but I can't seem to make them work. I tried those, and also with local-set-key, but no bliss.
 For the sake of concreteness, here is one actual case I'm trying to have one such binding: I'd like to bind ' in the minibuffer for find-file and related commands which takes me to consult-find at the current location. So I have: 
 (defun gb/consult-find-for-minibuffer () "Search file with find, enter the result in the minibuffer." (interactive) (let ((dir (file-name-directory (minibuffer-contents))) (file (file-name-nondirectory (minibuffer-contents)))) (gb/minibuffer-quit-and-run (funcall-interactively 'consult-find dir file)))) ;; http://oremacs.com/2015/07/16/callback-quit/ ;; But this version comes from Ivy. (defmacro gb/minibuffer-quit-and-run (&rest body) "Quit the minibuffer and run BODY afterwards." (declare (indent 0)) `(progn (put 'quit 'error-message "") (run-at-time nil nil (lambda () (put 'quit 'error-message "Quit") (with-demoted-errors "Error: %S" ,@body))) (abort-recursive-edit))) 
 I currently bind this with:
 (define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd "'") `(menu-item "" gb/consult-find-for-minibuffer :filter ,(lambda (cmd) (when (memq current-minibuffer-command '(find-file find-file-other-window find-file-other-frame project-find-file)) cmd)))) 
 But I find this procedure somewhat clumsy, and would prefer to use vertico-multiform for that.
 So, is there a general procedure to use vertico-multiform to make a keybinding on the minibuffer-local-map for specific commands?

 I've been trying to use 'tmux' in 'vterm' to manage some terminals, but the tricky part I have found is to grab buffer text from split terminals that are split horizontally (aka one top terminal and one bottom terminal) for log trackback stuff.
 That being said, does anyone know any good Emacs packages could open up a buffer to quickly switch between available 'vterm' instances on the fly? This alone would be super helpful to me since I usually have to run at least two separate 'vterm' terminals for web dev stuff for Ruby On Rails and React (aka on terminal for 'npm start', and one terminal for 'rails s' for local development).
 Thanks so much!

One of the things I have a hard time liking is that when I enter a multiplication like "a * b" what calc shows on the stack becomes "a b". I could care less how it looks on the stack but I do care that this is also how it looks when I yank it into an org mode buffer. I tried it with and without no-simplification and also with latex Mode but it doesn't do anything different. Ideally I would like it to display "*" when in normal mode and \cdot when in latex mode.
 I am on Emacs 28.2 and also tried this with emacs -q.
 Is this intended behavior? Is there an option or a way for me to get my wishes granted?

 Some users asked for Windows support in Eat, so I'm considering it. I don't use Windows, so I need help from someone who is familiar with Windows.
 After searching the internet, I found that Alacritty supports Windows. I discovered that the TERM in the Alacritty terminal on Windows is xterm-256color, instead of alacritty or alacritty-direct. I also discovered that there's also a dumb TERM environment variable in Windows, but no TERMINFO environment.
 Now, my questions are:
  
Does Windows have any mechanism to inform the program about the terminal's capabilities (like terminfo in Unix-like systems), or is it fixed to the XTerm escape sequences?
 
Why M-x eat and M-x term says Spawning child process: Invalid argument on Windows?
 
Does set-process-window-size work in Windows?
 
Is it possible to support Windows only using Emacs Lisp (without any C code)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am excited to announce my new Emacs package, ancilla.el, which is my first attempt at writing a bigger Elisp project than just customizing my own stuff. The motivation behind this package was the recent discontinuation of OpenAI's Codex API, which caused another Emacs package, codex-completion, to stop working. I wanted to improve the AI-coding interaction and came up with some new ideas that I implemented in ancilla.el.
 I must admit that parts of the code were actually written with the help of ChatGPT and GPT-4, which was a really weird and fun experience.
 Thank you for your attention and I hope you give ancilla.el a try!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've asked myself how much of linear logic can be done in linear Haskell. I'm pretty sure that pure Linear Haskell isn't enough. Let's define:
 type Not a = a %1 -> () 
 This is the type of "obligations for an a" or "slots for an a". I don't think that there's a way to implement Not (Not a) %1 -> a, which is a requirement for linear logic. But looking through the linear-base library I found the following function:
 alloc :: Int -> (DArray a %1 -> ()) %1 -> Vector a 
 In other words: "Give me a way to fill an array with n elements and I'll give you an array with n elements". This means that alloc 1 is already what we want!!! linear-base (maybe accidentally?) implies all of linear logic. Of course it's a bit cheaty, alloc uses unsafeDupablePerformIO internally, but if the linear-base authors have decided that it's fine I'm okay with it.
 I wrote up some basics of linear logic in Haskell (over here). Using double negation you can implement both of the missing monoidal operations (& and ⅋/Par, the other two already exist: ⊗=(,) ⊕=Either) and interpreting Ur as ! also gives you ?. I've also done some laws including (iso-)mix and both exponential isomorphisms.
 I think it's a bit surprising that it's actually doable. I would have expected that it's either already done or deliberately impossible. But I haven't found anyone talking about doing it, the closest is this library by Edward Kmett which uses some magic to embed linear logic inside of linear Haskell. Unlike this approach I don't think it gives you linear logic for all of LinHask, but only for some types.

 i normally use visal-line-mode and olivetti-mode, but had to turn them off to get a better view of the table.
  
I've thought of binding some keys to jump to the next/prev column.
 I've looked at https://github.com/misohena/phscroll, but was wondering if there are other approaches
 as i was writing this post, i noticed org-end-of-line provides nice horizontal navigation (it kind of goes to the end of the visible line, not the literal end). however, org-beginning-of-line goes straight to the beginning of the line

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had a curious psychological reaction to using Emacs for pretty much everything on a minimal linux desktop over about six months. I think it was to to with the plain text and almost complete lack of graphical interest. I just started feeling really flat emotionally. Like the screen I was looking at was utterly uninteresting.
 So I went back to windows for a while, using VS Code, a graphical git client and so on and strangely there I felt the opposite, like the graphical density with so much on the screen was almost overwhelming after months without all that graphical clutter. That faded over a week or two and I found myself adding a few non-Emacs apps with more graphical elements alongside Emacs to mix things up.
 This was quite strange, I learned to program using VT terminals and actually worked in places where my daily computer was a vax system with a VT terminal and never felt anything like this.
 I'm not intending this as a slight against Emacs, but I found it was interesting that my brain just started to shut down a little due to the lack of stimulating stuff on the screen. I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? I know some of you guys pretty much live in Emacs 24/7, do you find it overwhelming to use a very graphical application after that? Or people who do the opposite and work in a graphically intensive environment a lot, do you find it relaxing, or boring, or have any other reaction to switching to Emacs (or any other plain text environment) afterwards?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, I've been trying to create a function that can be called to load a CSV into a string array, but I'm having trouble returning it outside the array once it's captured. Here's the code I have so far:
 object CSVImport extends App: println("Running CSVImport") def run(path: String) /* : Array[String] */ = val bufferedSource = io.Source.fromResource(path) //val outputArr = new Array[String](5) for line <- bufferedSource.getLines.drop(1) do val outputArr = line.split(",").map(_.trim) bufferedSource.close //outputArr 
 I'm attempting to call it in Main:
 @main def Main() = val arrayOutput = CSVImport.run(csvPath) 
 I've tried to make the Object Def output to an Array[String], however I've been struggling with making the output work. When I execute the code as-is with the extra bits commented out, I get a nice Scala array which I can call individual columns using println(s"${flightData(1)}"), but when I uncomment the extra code the output becomes a mess, I think due to the Array format being from java. I get the output [Ljava.lang.String;@35f983a6.
 My question is, is it possible to export the outputArr without converting it to a java format, so I can keep the legibility and pass it through to other functions? and if not, how can I format the gibberish output into something usable?

 I come to you with a tale of woe, for I have been both blessed and cursed by the Emacs wizardry. As my fingers dance across the keyboard, conjuring powerful Emacs incantations with ease, I find myself unable to enjoy the mundane GUIs and simple apps that litter the software landscape. 🧹🖱️
 You see, dear friends, Emacs has spoiled me with its boundless customization, incredible extensibility, and mind-bending keybindings. Now, I dread the moments when I must use the pedestrian applications my company forces upon me. Oh, how I long for the sweet embrace of Emacs in those dark hours! 💔🕰️
 In my despair, I turn to you, my fellow Emacs magicians, for camaraderie and counsel:
  
How do you cope when the world demands you to use lesser tools? 🛠️😢
 Are there secret spells to imbue these uninspired apps with even a fraction of Emacs' power? 🔮✨
 Can we petition the powers that be to make Emacs the one true editor, unifying the world in a harmonious symphony of keystrokes? 🌍🎼
  
I eagerly await your wisdom and insights. In the meantime, I'll be huddled in the corner, clutching my Emacs manual like a treasured tome, dreaming of the day when all software is as magically magnificent as our beloved editor. 📖💭
 Yours in Emacs enchantment, 🧙‍♂️

I was thinking about breaking this existing file up into many pieces by date into it's own subdirectory and naming the files by date. Maybe having a file by day, though I could possibly get away with the files still being small enough by having a file per-month versus per-day.
 As such I need new captures to go to a new file (automatically naming file like YYYY-MM-DD__suffix.org) if it is a new day and then continue to put additional captures to that new file throughout that day. Then it would begin the cycle again for the next day.
 I believe this is beyond the existing functionality of org-capture from my research so maybe there is package out there that works like this or maybe I just have to figure out how to code an e-lisp solution if not?

But when I do C-c n f it gives me the error.

 Been using it to convert sql to honeysql and it can do a pretty good job saving me converting it currently doing it in browser but would like some closer integration.

 launch an emacs web server, in a new session, to serve the files contained within the "public" directory, which is located in same directory my script is called.
 THE APPROACH:
 use a basic shell script (./launch.sh) to run an emacs-lisp build script (./build.el) that uses org-publish to publish my org files to HTML files in the (.public/) directory, mentioned earlier, then serve them in a web server written in emacs-lisp.. amazing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I was wondering a while ago how Haskell "decides" if a given recursive type definition should be given by the least or greatest fixed point. In particular, for a given type equation there are two canonical solutions given by the least and greatest fixed point respectively. But certain types "feel" more like one than the other. For example, lists or Peano numerals "feel" like least fixed points, whereas streams "feel" like greatest fixed points (and in fact the LFP solution is just the empty type, ignoring bottom). So then how does Haskell decide which form to take if the user never specifies?
 So this got me thinking: are Haskell recursive datatypes always given by greatest fixed points? This does seem to make sense mathematically, as for example gfp X. (1 + X) would give the naturals plus a point at infinity, and this translates in Haskell to
 data Nat = Z | S Nat zero = Z one = S Z two = S (S Z) ... inf = S inf 
 (i.e. we can implement a term representing an infinite stack of successors)
 So is this actually the case? Does Haskell justify recursive datatypes by greatest fixed points? Or maybe does it not really care about any mathematical justification (i.e. you just get what you get by making a tagged union and putting pointers to the right types)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it possible to treat headings with TODO keywords fundamentally different in the LaTeX export? I'd like to not treat them as headings, in a normal document structure, but rather render them as insertion, interupting the document structure, but i still want to render normal headings as normal headings, which are part of the document structure.
 I'd prefer to do this using pandoc, but if there is an easy alternative, I'd happily take it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I am about to say is best reproduced with an empty configuration. So if you want to reproduce this issue just back up your ~/.emacs.d and any other init files to a different folder and try this.
  
First I run M-x customize.
 In the search box I search font-lock-comment-face. The default color is shown as Firebrick and the default state is STANDARD.
 Change the color to green.
 Then Apply and Save. The state becomes SAVED and set.
 Check ~/.emacs. It has this code inserted: '(font-lock-comment-face ((t (:foreground "green"))))
 Now Revert > Erase Customizations. The face is now -- Empty face --. The state becomes EDITED, shown value does not take effect until you set or save it. (This is where I have trouble. Why is the state not STANDARD again? Why is the face not Firebrick again?)
 Then Apply and Save. 
 Check ~/.emacs. It has '(font-lock-comment-face ((t nil))).
 The comments are now black in my code.
  
Why does "Erase customizations" remove the default value? Why does it not revert the customization to standard state as mentioned in Emacs documentation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure if chatgpt these days is powered by GPT-4 or not, but it's showing improvements in some areas compared to where it was a few months ago. Nowadays, if I ask it "Why do sharks eat elephant eggs" it doesn't tell me that sharks rarely get a chance to do so cause elephant eggs are so large and on land, but rather that elephants do not lay eggs.
 Today I decided to test it by asking how one would use Scala 3 macros to get the types of the inputs and outputs of a method. It had some decent suggestions to do that for someone that is new to macros, but a lot of its answer was false, suggesting people use something called QuotesContext, not recognizing properly what extension methods are available for the Symbol type, and worst of all, trying to splice Type values into an Expr.
 If they can manage to get chatgpt to actually tell the truth consistently (like saying "I don't know how to do that" rather than just lying) I think it will be a nice resource for discovering how to do stuff you don't currently know how to do. Sadly, it's still got a nasty habit of making stuff up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was just going through my older journal entries and found the following entry: 
  
I do not think that AI is the right choice for a lot of our things if the underlying problem of freeing humans always remains. It makes more sense to me to be a part of a group where the focus is on freeing our time through removal of shackling of our time than to build AIs that feed the capitalist to extract more wealth from underpaying humans and from keeping them subjugated to 8 hour work days no matter how advanced the AI is. Eventually, the AI is going to be a prime worker for the capitalist than for the betterment of humanity. 
 I refuse to be a part of this process and that is why I am choosing not to get into those domains in any which way. 
 Emacs therefore remains my stronghold that I would like to curate and build my freedom from. If one cannot free themselves from 8 hour senselessness, then they can build stuff to free up time and work from home and do other more productive and happiness, mental peace bringing things. Productive here means that doing what I really want to do and doing it rather than producing as much value for the capitalist who would rather discard me if there was a more productive person or an AI.
  
This reminded me about one of the prime reasons why I wanted to use Emacs - it's extensibility that enabled me to build shortcuts and workflows that help me with shaving off sufficient amount of time which I spent on repetitive tasks. The trick however is to not to be vocal about your efficiency to your bosses because the time saved will be used against you to staff you with more work whether you want it or not. 
 Go use the time saved to spend with your loved ones, yourself, exercise, learn something, do nothing or even just calm and rest. It's your reclaimed time. 
 Who else does this?

The closest I have found in the docs to doing what I want is org-toggle-item, but at least the standard behavior doesn't preserve the depth of the heading that you convert, and it also doesn't work on a whole subtree, but instead just over a single item. 
 Why isn't this a common enough use-case to be built-in functionality? How is this not something that everyone else wants all the time too?

After going through books like Get Programming with Haskell and Haskell in Depth and making some projects I want to delve deeper into the more advanced stuff available with the language an become proficient with it (usage of DataKinds, GADTs, HKTs and so on, even linear types).
 However, I'm finding it difficult to come with use cases for these features and examples where these features can be the most appropriate answer. I struggle to wrap my head around the concepts as they are exposed in Haskell in Depth for example. Of course I don't blame the book, but I feel there wasn't enough room in it for me to get the clear picture (as obviously there were many more things to cover in around 600 pages)…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was introduced to Haskell by a friend a few years ago (he has a PhD in Automatic Theorem Proving). I tried learning, but got bogged down by the mathematical intricacies.
 Fast forward a few years and I went to a couple sessions about category theory by Bartosz Milewski (in person), but it still seemed way over my head.
 I've been a software engineer for ~6 years now, and have always been interested in the concept of formal verification, "proof-based" correctness, etc, and Haskell always seems to come up. How do I learn Haskell properly this time? The "Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!" didn't quite resonate with me, so open to suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Information
  
Overview: Khoj now exposes a chat interface to your second brain. Uses GPT models by OpenAI.
 Background: I'd posted about Khoj a few months ago. Since then khoj.el has become available on MELPA, gotten a Chat interface and can automatically set up the backend python package. Thought I'd provide an update for folks to try it out.
 Chat Features 
 Faster answers: Find answers faster, with less effort than search. No need to manually scan through your notes to find answer
 Iterative discovery: Iteratively explore and (re-)discover your notes using multi-turn conversations
 Creative assistance: Smoothly weave answers retrieval with content generation
 
  
Quickstart:
  
M-x package-install khoj
 M-x eval-expression RET (setq khoj-openai-api-key "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")
 M-x khoj RET c via transient
  
See readme for proper setup instructions
 Warning: Your query and notes in search results are sent to OpenAI for ChatGPT to respond.

 Progress so far: * CentOS 7 yum install ghc provides 7.6, but ghc 9.0.2 requires ghc 8.8 to build (which requires 8.4, which requires 8.0, which requires 7.8, which can be built with 7.6) * Wasn't able to figure out how to cross compile for this platform using this doc: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/building/cross-compiling * Ubuntu bionic does provide ghc 8.0 with the same glibc version, which does work when copied into CentOS 7 * Building ghc 8.4 on CentOS 7 is now giving me "C99-compatible compiler needed"

I then end up with a file that should be in the package com.exmaple.bar with the statement package com.example.foo. Is there an lsp-java command to fix the package statement, assuming that the directory is correct? 
 I can write something that searches for the package statement and checks it against the directory, but if the code already exists, I'd rather just use it. And it's probably been checked against some corner cases that I'm initially going to miss (like if there is no package statement at all).

Slowly I am getting more interested towards it. I am programming for more than a decade. Much of my programming is around C#, Java & JavaScript(Currently). I am exploring functional programming for few months now, just out of curiosity. Now am thinking to move my career towards new paradigm and projects.
 1. How big is job market for Haskell and which are the major industries? ( of course location is important, am currently based out of India), But generally.
  
Where Haskell stands against other functional programming languages like Scala, F# & Clojure, in terms of usage in industry and which are those? 
 
Optimal learning path and projects to start with!
 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem with missing "org-assert-version" is known and described a lot. Also the workaround. But I don't get it.
 I'm using Emacs 27 from Debian 11 repo. I removed the whole ~/.emacs.d/elpa folder just to be sure that org is "deinstalled".
 The I created this el file
 ``` (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))
 (package-refresh-contents) (package-install 'org) ```
 And loaded it via emacs -Q -l x.el. But I got the message that org is already installed.
 I don't know how to go along.
 Some background info: That Emacs 27 was working very well the last year. But I tried Emacs29, build it myself. But then I removed it (via sudo make uninstall and make distclean). Something must happens since then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So far I've been using tree-sitter.el with the tree-sitter-hl-mode for syntax highlighting. As far as I understand, Tree Sitter is now built-into Emacs 29 and above as treesit (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/admin/notes/tree-sitter/starter-guide), which makes tree-sitter.el obsolete. There is also this package https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto which seems to handle the installation, mapping and activation of the language modes.
 But what I don't understand is, how do I activate syntax hightlighing with treesit, without having tree-sitter-hl-mode? Is this done automatically once the major mode for a given language supports Tree Sitter? With the help of treesit-auto?

 Sacha Chua has solved this: https://sachachua.com/blog/2021/04/emacs-hydra-allow-completion-when-i-can-t-remember-the-command-name/
 Except, the binding to tab in the hydra-base-map doesn't work, I can't figure out why. The my/hydra-execute-extended function works great though, if you invoke it after quitting hydra.
 Any ideas how to fix the binding?
 P.S. Huge thanks to Sacha, I learned a lot about emacs through her blog.

 Just trying to find a way to do spellchecking in English and my native language in Emacs without spending days setting up workarounds to make things work.

 <M-x> compile <RET> docker-compose -f /very/long/path/to/my/docker-compose.yml up -d 
 and it actually works. However I still have many other simple commands, for now I can navigate up/down one-by-one to find the exactly command, but it would be more productive to have the list of history suggestions (just like fzf command history) when I press "<M-x> compile <RET>"
 How can I do that in emacs?
 p/s: I use vertico.

I understand this is not the latest Haskell compiler - I intentionally want to match versions and work through specific examples, that are over a decade old. My goal is to work through the exercises as Bruce, the author, intended. 
 Are there any pre-built VMs, or community resources for easy-installations for older versions? I tried asdf and the version of Haskell was just too old to get the right pieces together for compilation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I released the first version of the Jinx spell checker on GNU ELPA. Jinx aims to be efficient and unobtrusive, such that you can enable it always. Jinx provides the jinx-correct command to correct the nearest misspelling via completion or all misspellings in the whole buffer if invoked with a prefix argument.
 For performance reasons Jinx directly binds to the libenchant native library and lazily checks only the visible portion of the current buffer. Libenchant provides backends like Hunspell and Nuspell which also power the spell checking in word processors or browsers.
 I am interested in your feedback. The package is still young, so expect some rough edges. See the following links for more details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this must be in docs somewhere, but I haven't been able to make it cooperate and it's been driving me to cocoa puffs. 
 What causes org-roam to jump to the capture even when `:jump-to-capture nil` is set on the template it uses? https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/1292 (seems to be an issue others have run into)
 ​
 Looking through the code it appears a `:finalize` template keyword is used to potentially run either `org-roam-capture--finalize-find-file` or `org-roam-capture--finalize-insert-link` (it seems to be running the former now) 
 Everything I change in the template seems to be irrelevant. 
 At this point I'm thinking of just removing the entire org-roam-capture--finalize hook from org-capture-after-finalize-hook. And just resyncing the db separately?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A "morgue file" is a collection of notes, articles, and files kept by investigators or journalists for possible future use. Today, I have developed a morgue file that in my zettelkasten that collects items that I think might provide fodder for my fiction writing.
I write speculative fiction and so I track newspaper articles or reports that I think might serve as the germ of a story. Then, as part of my writing process, I'll make a new (structure) note and include links to articles or pieces that might inspire pieces of my story (whether character, setting, or plot).
For example, I recently learned about Point Nemo, a "spacecraft cemetery" in the Pacific Ocean that is a "pole of inaccessibility," the location farthest from any land. This was intriguing enough, so I did some more cursory reading and learned (among other things) that it is also a remarkably lifeless part of the ocean because it is so far from land. Also, in spite of not being officially identified as the "pole of inaccessibility" until 1992, Point Nemo is near where H.P. Lovecraft placed R'lyeh, the lost city where Cthulhu is imprisoned!
At any rate, I now have a cluster of notes about Point Nemo that is forming the gensis of a story about scavengers trying to salvage material in this remote location. The real-life details are helping me flesh out the skeleton of a plot and raising more questions for me to explore. (For example, I know next to nothing about what might be involved in this salvage operation, so I now have some more reading to do!)
I thought I'd share in case others are interested in using their zettelkasten to generate ideas for fiction, and to learn from others who might implement a similar practice. Do you have any other tips or advice? Pitfalls to avoid?]]></summary>

I read through the post here:https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8t461y/how_to_run_a_graphical_emacsclient_on_a_remote/ which covers the main steps, however, once I run the x2go client, It runs into a blank white screen.

Is there a way to convert the md-files to org and at the same time keep the links and connections in my vault intact (I have a lot of notes so editing the links would take a looong time)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to switch to eshell from vterm+zsh and I find some of the user experience frustrating. For example, while pcomplete opens a new window for completion it does not switch to it automatically and it does not escape the spaces. This means that every time I have to add quotes myself or escape the spaces manually. I would also like pcomplete to be like orderless and vertico and allow me to select entries the same way.
 I am now using corfu with eshell and it is a bit less frustrating but it is still not smooth as much as zsh completion system is. For example, I have to press escape otherwise I cannot stop the corfu autocompletions once it is activated.
 So my questions are:
 ​
  
Is there a way to make pcomplete escape spaces and special characters when completing in eshell? Ideally I should not have to switch to the pcomplete window but it should be done automatically.
 Is there a way to use vertico and orderless, rather than pcomplete, or even in tandem with pcomplete? I would like my eshell experience to be as close to the rest of the Emacs.
 Is there any other suggestion or improvement that makes you life in eshell easier?
  
​
 Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Just updated to the newest Emacs 29, with straight.el:  (use-package expand-region :straight (expand-region.el :type git :host github :repo "magnars/expand-region.el") :bind (("M-e" . er/expand-region)) ) 
 While this package used to work correctly on an early December 2022 snapshot of Emacs 29, currently it no longer seems to work correctly. As soon as I invoke the command er/expand-region, the entire document is selected instead of (sub)sections of an org document, or paragraphs in a text document.
 Did anyone encounter this issue?
 Bad
 PS: I encountered some other issues with this Emacs 29 version that could be fixed by just re-loading the top elisp file of a package (e.g., yasnippet), but this would not work here.

I marked a region on the Git history I was looking at and tried unsuccessfully to re-word all of them (each at the time), it is the commit under the pointer or nothing.
 The same happens when I want to remove commits. And I also don't understand how to cherry-pick commits from one branch to another (I did learned about "donate" commits using Magit, which does what I want with a region of commits)
 How am I supposed to use these features from Magit? What am I doing wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 today I updated to the latest HEAD of the Emacs 29 branch. It looks like it broke several packages.
 First: yasnippet. When enabled via yas-global-mode it regularly causes errors like this:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-number-of-arguments #<subr vertico-exit> 2) vertico-exit(undo 0.5) yas--post-command-handler() 
 The second one is highlight-indent-guides. When enabled it throws errors like this:
 Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments #<subr get-text-property> 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1501) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments #<subr get-text-property> 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 3001) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments #<subr get-text-property> 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 2488) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments #<subr get-text-property> 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 3988) signaled (void-function nil) 
 I can't get a backtrace via toggle-debug-on-error, sorry :(
 It also looks like I can avoid these errors by disabling nativecomp: when setting this in early-init.el:
 (setq native-comp-jit-compilation-deny-list '(".*") native-comp-speed -1) 
 all errors are gone.
 Is this my fault?
 Best regards, CK

I use it mostly with python, but I'm guessing it should work OK with other languages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So let's say I have a main where I try to process input arguments, perhaps open a chosen file with specific extension only, read something from the file in an expected format, etc. And I have proc_args, check_extension, proc_file_data, functions. Each of those functions can fail, eg if necessary argument is missing, file with wrong extension has been provided, the file doesn't follow the expected format. Based on what I know about haskell, using Maybe type as the return value of the functions seems reasonable to me, Nothing if it fails, Just result if it succeeds. What I'm having trouble with is how to actually utilize this in main. I do something like this
 let proc_args_result = proc_args args if proc_args_result == Nothing then die "Invalid arguments" else return() ... -- continue working with processed arguments 
 the problem is that if I want to continue working with the processed arguments, I still have the Maybe value instead of the actual value of the result. Alternative is using
 case proc_args args of { Nothing -> die ... Just value -> ... -- continue here } 
 but that will lead to uncontrollable indentation

 Notes:
 - I changed the file-naming convention with this version. Binary sets are now named to include the git revision short code instead of the date of build.
 - My build script seems to work gooder than ever b4 so I'll probably start making these snapshots pretty aggressively, as I see commits to the Emacs 29 branch, during the final push to release of Emacs 29.1

 [[ $TERM == "dumb" ]] && unsetopt zle && PS1='$ ' && return
 ​
 When remoting in, it will list files at the home directory, but when I try to switch into any folder remotely, I don't see a directory listing.
 When looking at the Messages buffer, I do see this message: 
 Invalid face reference: dired-directory-face [72 times]. 
 Is it possible this is related, and is there a workaround?

 (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-1") (lambda () (interactive) (message "Hello"))) 
 But if I press C-S-1 I get this error:
 C-! is undefined 
 I know that this works:
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-!") (lambda () (interactive) (message "Hey"))) 
 Now on pressing C-! I do get the message "Hey".
 But I want to know why my first key binding C-S-1 does not work?
 Note: I am not trying to solve any specific problem. So I am not looking for suggestions on how to "solve" the problem. There is nothing to solve. I am only trying to understand why C-S-1 does not work. Hopefully understanding this will teach me a thing or two about how Emacs key bindings.

  (setq global-auto-revert-mode 1) (setq auto-revert-use-notify nil) ;; e.g. for dired buffers (setq global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t) 
 After starting emacs I checked the value of that variables and they are as expected.
 But auto-revert doesn't work even in a simple txt file. I open a txt file. Then I also open it with another editor (geany), edit and save it. Nothing happens in emacs. When I try to edit that file in emacs I'm informed about that this file was modified. But this is to late. I want to make the revert automatic without asking me first.
 Then I disable(!) the global revert mode and enabled it again. Then it works. Modifications I do with Geany are loaded in the emacs buffer automatically.
 First I thought something interfered with my python/eglot/xyz setup. But as I say it also happens with a txt file.

 The error is
 Diagnostics: 1. • Couldn't match expected type ‘p’ with actual type ‘r -> Int’ ‘p’ is a rigid type variable bound by the inferred type of getter :: Example -> p • In the expression: field In an equation for ‘getter’: getter (Example {field}) = field In an equation for ‘fieldL’: fieldL = lens getter setter where getter (Example {field}) = field setter _ f = Example {field = f} • Relevant bindings include field :: r -> Int getter :: Example -> p 
 Why can I not create a lens for an existential data type? How can I make lenses for existential data types?
 Update: The real code is
 data RowHdr n e = forall r. RowHdr { draw :: ListFocused -> WidthDeficit -> RowHdrCtxt -> r -> Widget n , width :: AvailWidth -> [r] -> RowHdrWidth , toRH :: e -> Index -> r } 
 I just want a lens into this data type.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've been using org-roam to make notes and what not. And it has been going great. Now, I have an exam, which is an open-book exam, so I think printing out my notes would be very useful, since it can get into details of things. So, I wonder if there is a way to export all the linked notes to HTML/PDF, so I can easily print them? Now, i don't want notes to be in some order, it is just that I want if A -> B (A links to B), and if A is getting exported, so should B. (I know there can be cycles, so I will traverse only few depths before I return).
 Does this sound like something which has been accomplished before, or I should try to do it before exams? :)

 With one exception (see below), all the info/libraries that I have found are a little dated, and I would like to know how to interpret that fact: have the existing 3D libraries/tools just come to a stable stage where they no longer need updating? Or is Haskell not (/no longer) a serious option for 3D graphics? In particular, is the OpenGL library a viable option today, or is it no longer worth looking into?
 Here's some of what I have found so far:
  
The wiki page about Graphics. Unless I am mistaken, the last 3D-related edits on that page are more than 10 years old.
 The OpenGL page on the wiki. Here again the information seems to be a little dated.
  
The exception (to the things I've found being old) is h-raylib, Haskell bindings to the Raylib library. It's very nice, but I'd be interested in knowing about the other options, notably lower-level ones.
 By the way, h-raylib doesn't appear on the Haskell wiki page. Should I add it?

@Massimo_Curatella said over at Ideas We're Grappling With March 23, 2023::
I am thinking about designing a tutorial on how to create your user profile to get the best out of participating to online communities.


Not sure that even a sparkling user profile like mine  is good enough to bolt us into participating or be a tornado hurling others to interact with us. But I could be wrong.

  
I need to set specific boundaries to my exploration and that was the smallest unit of value I could think of.


Concentrating on the user profile is a small gesture but who knows where it could lead? I'm willing to follow along and help where I can.

  
I started to talk about that idea to friends and, surprisingly, they found it useful.


I have a mildly snarky question, are you talking to us "about the idea as friends" or are we the "real people" you want to experiment on?
This is a superb idea, and I'll participate. I think this forum would benefit from anything that would enhance engagement.
To start this off, here is a screenshot of my profile.]]></summary>

 If I use the Evil shortcut `SPC w h` on the right buffer, trying to goto the Treemacs window, I get an error saying `No window left from selected` . 
 This is certainly not the case as Treemacs is open on the left. If I'm in Treemacs buffer, I'm able to go out with `SPC w l` but not back in. 
 I feel like I have done something dumb with my config. Do you know how to fix this behaviour ??
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there folks,
 pretty much got my emacs-based IDE working like a charm, save for one issue. But I'm REALLY banging my head against the wall with this one. Maybe someone can try to reproduce? I'm using lsp-mode with ts-ls. Works great for the most part, can't get yasnippet to work with autocompletion no matter what I try, but I just bound inserting a snippet and it's enough, so don't mind that.
 I'm getting an error message from lsp-mode if I chuck in the following piece of code and move my cursor over the function name (triggering suggested code actions):
 function somefunc(arg_without_type) { } 
 The error message reads: https://hastebin.com/share/onatikugar.php
 Blurts it into the message and mini-buffer, too, so I can't just ignore it, sadly. Looks like an error with the language server and not my config, but you never know. I'm pasting the mode configs that might have something to do with it below. If it isn't my config, can someone recommend me a good alternative? I'm thinking tide.
 (use-package lsp-mode :after company :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l") :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t)) (use-package lsp-ui :bind (("C-," . lsp-ui-peek-find-references) ("C-." . lsp-ui-peek-find-definitions)) :config (progn (define-key lsp-ui-mode-map [remap xref-find-definitions] #'lsp-ui-peek-find-definitions) (define-key lsp-ui-mode-map [remap xref-find-references] #'lsp-ui-peek-find-references))) (use-package flycheck :diminish :init (global-flycheck-mode)) (use-package company :diminish :hook (prog-mode . company-mode) :bind (:map company-active-map ("<tab>" . company-complete-selection)) (:map lsp-mode-map ("<tab>" . company-indent-or-complete-common)) :custom (company-minimum-prefix-length 1) (company-idle-delay 0.1)) 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am kinda posing a question in the form of a package here: basically, what’s the most efficient way to bind keys? It’s one of those questions I had neglected to ask for so long that I’m a little afraid to ask now, cuz keyboard macros are kind of a core feature to Emacs. Anyway, here's what I wrote:
 https://github.com/Overdr0ne/skey
 I felt like there was a missing define-keys function, so I tried to provide it in this package. Rather than writing:
  (define-key some-map (kbd "x") #'my-func) (define-key some-other-map (kbd "x") #'my-func) (define-key some-map (kbd "y") #'my-other-func) (define-key some-other-map (kbd "y") #'my-other-func) etc...  skey lets you write:  (skey-define-keys '(some-map some-other-map) '(("x" my-func) ("y" my-other-func) etc...)) 
 As of this writing, skey is 9 lines of code in one function. Is there already a standard way to do this? Is everyone just using raw define-key, maybe in a loop? general? use-package’s :bind? Reinventing your own key definers? I explain more in the readme some of the ways I bind keys, but I was just curious how other people are doing things.
 Suggestions for additional features to this package are welcome, but I would be just as happy to learn that there’s a simple, standard way to do what this package does. Maybe add lazy loading by default or something? I dunno, this is kind of a weird post lol...

 I'm told that the right way to upgrade Emacs is through the same method it was installed. But that's hit a bit of a stumbling block.
 I've installed Emacs through Synaptic. According to Synaptic, I'm on the latest version (Version 47??? What does that number refer to?). So I can't update through that.
 I'd love to be more up-to-date, but I don't want to create any problems through installing from another method. What's the right way to do this? 
 Do I have to un-install from Synaptic and re-install from the command line? And if I do, what happens to all the packages I've installed, do I have to re-install every single package again?
 While we're at it, is Emacs 28.2 the recommended version to update to? Or should I try something a little less bleeding edge, if that's still showing any problems?

 https://ag91.github.io/blog/2023/03/24/moldable-emacs-what-is-the-public-api-of-this-elisp-buffer/
 I was thinking to extend it with another view that evaluates the API: any chance anybody has a good reference for evaluating APIs? I am thinking things like how many functions should an interface have to remain usable and understandable for instance.
 Anyway hopefully this gives more ideas on how to use tree-sitter apart for major modes ;)

This week I've been distracted by schoolwork. The second paper in my ENGL501 class was due. I feel good about it, but we'll see. I spent too much time programming, according to my sweetie. She is probably right, but getting lost in programming problems felt so good.
Thoughts about construal level theory have surfaced again in my ZK, leading me to Robin Hanson, Associate Professor at George Mason University, and his paper on the sacred. We See The Sacred From Afar, To See It The Same. I quickly looked at the paper, and while I don't agree with everything, Robin's look at the construal-level theory and how it relates to our concept of sacred is fascinating and well-referenced.
A week filled with productive distractions. Next week I'm afraid other people's expectations of me will creep up the priority list.
What's happening in your ZK?

 The code above is correct, but i could also bind C-c to a keymap which contains "z" and "o" bound to another keymap which respectively binds "p" and "s" to to 'backward-char.
 ​
 The question is: when is it needed to define a new keymap?

 Is there any kind of (runtime) instrumentation possible in Haskell similar to Java? I need to add some OpenTelemetry monitoring to existing Haskell software and don't know how to approach it. Is the only way forking the source and have custom build of a library (talking about PostgREST / hasql in particular).
 EDIT: I am aware of two OpenTelemetry Haskell libraries. What I am really asking about is if it is possible to inject monitoring logic into existing software without modifying/rebuild it?
 In Java there is instrumentation framework that can be used to do that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 You can find Leafy-mode on GitHub here: leafy-mode
 I've developed a new Emacs minor-mode called Leafy-mode, designed to seamlessly integrate ChatGPT within org-mode documents. This allows you to have long-running, tree-structured AI conversations similar to the web UI.
 Here's a quick rundown of the features:
  
Intelligent token prioritization: Leafy-mode prioritizes sending sibling branches and ancestor nodes to the OpenAI API when the token context fills up, dropping less relevant content.
 Easy model switching: Switch between GPT models with a simple click on the status bar, upgrading to GPT-4 temporarily if GPT-3.5 gets stuck.
 Document cost tracking: Leafy-mode tracks total costs and tokens per model as properties in your org-mode document.
  
Interestingly, ChatGPT not only played a major role in writing the code for Leafy-mode (using both the web UI and Emacs) but also came up with the name!
 Here's how I've been using Leafy-mode:
  
I have a "project documentation" org file open in one window and my code in a separate split window.
 I keep a high-level description of my project and a list of important functions for quick reference.
 I break down tasks into small, manageable pieces, working on each in its own org headline.
 Once a task is complete, I delete unnecessary details or archive them using an :ignore tag to maintain a clean workspace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, folks. I'm not much of an expert in emacs, so I need some help in debugging freezes when I edit python scripts with elpy-enabled (from MELPA). Here's elpy-config:
  Emacs.............: 28.2 Elpy..............: 1.35.0 Virtualenv........: None Interactive Python: python3 3.11.2 (/opt/homebrew/bin/python3) RPC virtualenv....: rpc-venv (/Users/user/.emacs.d/elpy/rpc-venv) Python...........: python3 3.11.2 (/opt/homebrew/bin/python3) Jedi.............: 0.18.2 Autopep8.........: 2.0.2 Yapf.............: 0.32.0 Black............: 23.1.0 Syntax checker....: flake8 (/opt/homebrew/bin/flake8) 
 As for elpy mode everything works fine. I see syntax highlighting, minibuffer help, autocompletion, etc.
 However sometimes when I remove quotation mark like this:
  print('Some text') -> print('Some text)  to edit a line or type backslash like:
  some_var = '' -> some_var = '\' 
 emacs hangs. Ctrl-g doesn't work. I've managed to get debugger log:
  Debugger entered--entering a function: * #f(compiled-function () #<bytecode 0x8811d380906745a>)() syntax-ppss() python-nav-end-of-statement() python-nav-end-of-defun() python-info-current-defun() #f(compiled-function (info) #<bytecode -0x106ed42f3a0db866>)(nil) elpy-promise-resolve([*elpy-promise* #f(compiled-function (info) #<bytecode -0x106ed42f3a0db866>) elpy-rpc--default-error-callback #<buffer myscript.py> nil] nil) elpy-rpc--handle-json(((result) (id . 314))) elpy-rpc--filter(#<process *elpy-rpc [project:~/prj/ environment:/opt/homebrew]*> "{\"result\": null, \"id\": 314}\n")  I have no clue what happens and why. My suggestions is it somehow related to highlighting, because removing or escaping quotation mark leads to changing syntax colors of the rest of the file and emacs can't handle it.
 I'll report the error to corresponding package developers or to gnu/emacs team directly, but first I need to found out what package/command is a problem.
 Any ideas?

 If so, should the dir be called slug or something more generic like src?
 Is a README.md expected or does the mode commentary in the source make that redundant? 
 If I'm going to write additional helper libraries that aren't directly connected should they go in a separate dir?
  
What are some projects you consider well structured/organized?

https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/10ilrpj/rules_update/
 https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/j8df0/moderator_guidelines_thems_the_rules/
  
Following some feedback on rule 1, it has been changed to the following:
  
 Top-level posts should be primarily about Haskell. For example a post about OCaml would only be allowed if there was a connection to Haskell. Posts about topics that are adjacent to Haskell, like for example functional programming, are typically allowed.
  
 Hopefully this expresses the intent of the rule more clearly. Obviously this is a Haskell sub-Reddit, so we're all here mostly for Haskell content. Here's some further clarification: 
  
The rule applies to top-level posts, not comments. 
 Posts should be about Haskell, but they may be about other related topics. 
 You should be able to complete the sentence: "This post is about Haskell because _."
 Moderators are only likely to take action for egregious violations. In general if a post is well received by the community, the moderators will let it stand. 
  
Thanks to u/adamgundry and u/bss03, among others, for bringing this to my attention. 
 I'm happy to answer any questions people have about the rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I've been debating workflows recently, and what I would really want is some way to make a rectangle frame within a current code buffer to quickly access dired to switch a file instead of having to split the window, and access Dired that way.
 Is there any way for a rectangle frame to appear ontop of the current one?
 And no, I don't want it to popup as a separate Emacs window itself, just need a rectangle centered in the center of the current buffer to show a dired buffer real quick.
 If that above is possible, is it possible to also use a fuzzy finder utility in Emacs the same way as well? Would love to quickly find a file and edit it real quick too.
 Thanks!

danger. We believe that with an appropriate set of tools and techniques it is
possible to improve the reliability of both existing and new software without a
huge upfront investment.
Formal methods do not have to be “too expensive” or “too time consuming”; simple
things can drastically improve the assurance of software, even without complete
verification. Furthermore, academia is constantly generating new ideas. Which of
those translate into suitable tools for a given context? There is a spectrum of
assurance and we believe in combining different techniques to gradually bring
software from zero assurance to fully verified. We aim to identify, use and
improve upon the most suitable tools for the job.
We offer high-assurance services and team augmentation for clients who either
have high-assurance needs or are themselves solution providers in this space. In
particular, we are happy to assist in the following areas:
Specification: help craft and lay specifications, and asses their aptness
to an original goal by proving relevant properties about them
Testing: help create better test suites, and build tools for executing
them over complex domains
Auditing: comprehensively test a system, report and showcase behaviours
that are potentially harmful to system security or safety, assess code quality
Tooling: improve existing tools to suit the testing/verification needs of
a particular project, or write domain-specific tools from scratch
Refactoring: help improve existing code bases through the use of
modularisation, strongly typed code, purity, and other compile-time guarantees
Full-fledged verification: assist in projects aiming to develop a
completely verified piece of software]]></summary>

I think there are two parts to why certain ideas gain traction and Farley leans toward performance while I look a lot at ergonomics. He says he agrees to some extent with Robert Martin's idea that language features (like type checking) are intended to constrain us, so we can't shoot ourselves in the foot. There are various reasons for adoption of language features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I've tried Tab Bar mode and Eyebrowse Mode, and I honestly don't like either one of them. The default tab styling and workflow for Tab Bar mode is not ideal for me, and I couldn't really get Eyebrowse mode to not freak out keybinding wise no matter what I did.
 With this in mind, going forward and ignoring the two above, I'm wondering, is there something similar to like 'i3' window manager, but within Emacs itself?
 Looking for something similar where it has like 5 window options where you can just swap between them on the fly, etc. Plus something that could save those buffers for later use would be great.
 ​
 Not sure if I qualify as someone who should just learn Projectile or something though since I have a few web dev projects I swap out to sometimes. I usually have Treemacs on the left pane with code being edited in Emacs on the right. I also need a separate screen for two split vterm terminals, and a separate screen for an org mode buffer notes pane. If I could manage this all within some kind of in-built window manager within Emacs in a sane way, I would be very very happy.
 ​
 Thanks.

 Now the GitHub ecosystem is getting better with the inclusion of GPT-4 (which is better than ChatGPT for simple code generation, which is in turn comparable with or better than Codex which is essentially behind Copilot) and some projects built around it: 
 - Copilot X: https://github.com/github-copilot/chat_waitlist_signup/ (basically a chat buffer) 
 - Copilot Voice: https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-voice/ (voice input) 
 - Copilot Docs: https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-docs/ (ask anything about the docs) 
 - Copilot for PRs: https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-pull-requests/ (helps in writing PRs) 
 - Copilot CLI: https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli/ (helps you with the ffmpeg and ghostscipt cli interfaces 🥴) 
 ​
 With all this AI hype and products shipping at an insane pace, I can't stop thinking of how the Emacs ecosystem could answer with an open and better alternative. I think Emacs is very well suited for this new text-based smart-ish assistant tech interface-wise (much more so than VS Code). 
 There are some "open-source" alternatives for the open-AI generative LLMs there, like LLAMA https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp trained and leaked by Meta, and made available in c++ and actually runnable even on a MacBook Air. Sure it's not as great as Codex, GPT-4 and such, but it's a start (there are also open datasets with lots of code https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack, so maybe in the future the gap will close). 
 Maybe we should work on something like this? 
 ​
 Very interested in what the community thinks about this in general.

 Does anyone know how to correct this within emacs? (Ideally, I want to be reading the pdf in one pane and making notes in org-roam in the other.

 ​
 tl;dr If your Emacs on Windows takes long to start, exclude its folder from Windows Defender.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a tiny helper library, which generates html tables from case classes (or Product, generally).
 https://github.com/Quafadas/scautable
 I guess it's kind of hard to get excited about html tables, but I felt it might be interesting enough to post, for two reasons; 
 - It seems a practical use of `Mirror` - there's no "macros" or seriously gnarly meta-programming, and yet it's fairly generic! I found it an interesting exercise ... and got some help from this forum earlier - thanks to those people.
 - It's entirely scala CLI. 
 The scala-cli part was remarkably quick to get all the of the project boilerplate in place, publish out of CI etc. Even better - it cross compiled (super easily), and it cross platform tests really easily! And has different tests and capabilities for the JVM etc. I think these parts of scala-cli might still be subject to change... but it was amazingly easy / fast to get all of the "project grind" in place. 
 Ultimately, there wasn't really a barrier, or a reason _not_ to (cross-)publish it - even something this small - and I think that's kind of fun :-).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Emacs Org mode to create fiction for over a decade, and I've slowly built up a pleasant system for laying out and linking files while I'm writing. I like linking quickly to relevant notes whenever names or keywords are mentioned in the main text of a story, and being able to manage those notes with the minimum of effort. It's always worked really well for me, so I coded up a package to have Emacs make it even easier. And, thus, Org Novelist was born. 
 I also wrote some code to export the stories to a standard manuscript format for submission to publishers. 
 The package takes care of most of the boring stuff for me, and lets me get on with actually writing.
 I realize that the set of people using Emacs for novel writing is likely to be quite small (and I coded this for my personal use rather than for public release), but if you think it could be useful, you can find Org Novelist on GitHub.
 Thanks for reading, and keep on writing!

You can help us by participating in a user study which investigates the quality of type error messages.
 The study will take about 15 to 20 minutes, and your task will be to evaluate the helpfulness of error messages for defective OCaml programs. There will be a short introduction to OCaml if you are not familiar with it.
 While the study uses OCaml Syntax, our results will be equally applicable to Haskell and other functional programming languages :)

 I have problem with Emacs and Slime. As of writing this post,
 Debian 11 apt keeps Emacs 27.1 and
 Fedora 37 dnf keeps Emacs 28.1
 On Debians Emacs you can instal Slime package
 M-x package-install RET slime RET 
 and it will run with e.g. sbcl without no problems. However on Fedoras 28-Emacs it will not. On start up, Emacs will give warning:
 Package cl is deprecated 
 Such a warning is described in this post for Emacs 27. But for what I understand it does not speak about Slime issue... But I continue, it is "only" a warning. Fedora version of Slime is 2.26.1 and after running
 M-x slime 
 I get
 Wrong number of arguments: (3 . 4), 2 
 and Slime won't start.
 What I tried:
  
installed dnf package emacs-slime
 edited and recompiled hyperspec.el in slime library as written here (also tried adding "unknown" as mentioned in comment of the post)
 tried to downgrade to Emacs 27.1 but Fedoras dnf does not maintain older versions than 28
 tried to install Emacs 27.1 from Gnu's archive but I get errors in make which might be for other post all together.
  
​
 If anyone encountered and solved these problems with Slime on Emacs 28, please let me know what you did. Also if anyone wants that make error output I can give you that.
 Thank you.

 Additionally when in evil mode there are some agda-mode keybinds beginning with C-u that I really wish could work. I'm not sure what they get remapped to, if anything. 
 Thank you for any help in understanding this. I'm very new to emacs (need to use it because the vscode agda extension is buggy), and I'm partial to doom. So I really hope I can find a way to make this all work

 ​
 I followed the manual (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables) and added with M-x add-file-local-variable-prop-line the line:
 ;;; -*- eval: (set-input-method 'latin-1-prefix); -*-
 to the beginning of the file, but when i open it the input method is not latin-1-prefix.
 If i explicitly evaluate the expression, then the input method is changed.
 Does any one know a way to specify the input method for just one file?
 I am using Emacs 30.0.50 with pgtk.

 Anyway, dap-mode only works with lsp-mode, so I was wondering if there was any plans to implement something similar to eglot, but for DAP.

 I can't believe this is something every emacs user just bears. There must be a correct solution for that.

 I was hoping someone had a flow where they then use org-roam to link up their notes with those Zotero stored pdfs with org-noter, make notes in org-roam (linked to the pdf), and then have the bibtex exported for when it's actually time to write those citations into a paper (which looks like zotero will do already_ to a file i could then use from emacs.
 Has anyone got a workflow llike this (with configs)? 
 I've googled most of the day trying to come down on any one person's setup for both the bilbio management (and citations) as well as the annotating of those source materials but did not find one that was focused more on the knowle…]]></summary>

 Are there non-GPT LLM integrations for Emacs? I'm looking for a free software or open source model that can either be run locally or self-hosted and integrated with Emacs. I've seen lots of OpenAI GPT integrations but I really think the Emacs community could get behind an open, free model, even if it's less impressive for now. 
 Is anyone working on this? I'm not a great elisp coder but I'd love to help.

There's some interesting in this for sure, but I feel like I haven't seen people recognizing that this isn't just another interesting trend we can integrate into our favorite editor, this could be a really pivotal moment for emacs, because I contend there isn't another application out there that is so well suited to working with LLMs.
 First of all, the primary thing you want when dealing with LLMs is integrate it with your writing environment. Emacs can do that, and already does, via many different packages. And with Emacs, you can use it to write just about anything. Code, documentation, technical paper…]]></summary>
