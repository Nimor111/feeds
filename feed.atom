        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is org-mode difficult to use on Microsoft Windows?
 Org-mode is a highly versatile and powerful tool for organizing notes, tasks, and documents. While it was originally developed for use with the Emacs text editor on Unix-based operating systems, it can be used on other platforms as well, including Microsoft Windows.
 However, using Org-mode on Windows can be more challenging than using it on other operating systems for several reasons:
 Emacs installation: Emacs, the text editor used to run Org-mode, is not included in Windows by default, so users need to install it separately. This can be a complex process, especially for users who are not familiar with command-line interfaces or Unix-based software.
 Compatibility issues: Some of the advanced features of Org-mode, such as exporting …]]></summary>

Some times the characters are a few ones scattered on the screen, some times they align in a line, and you can't select and delete them. They only disappear when you close and reopen the buffer. I also didn't find there is an operation pattern that triggers this. Anyone knows why, and how to solve this problem? thank you very much.

 I read that splitting up Org files is not always a smart idea. I was thinking if I should put all them in one file and eventually create "custom agenda views" to separate the personal and work tasks in case things start to get crowded.

 Credit where credit is due: 
 When building this, I had a long hard look at Bufler by alphapapa, especially the implementation in bufler-workspace-tabs.el

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current opinions (subject to change):
  
Most websites should mostly work without JS enabled. (In fact, they should mostly work even on text-only browsers.)
 Most "single page apps" (SPAs) could easily be ordinary websites that mostly work without JS enabled.
 Most SPAs therefore suck (because of the fact that they are SPAs to begin with).
 Calling Haskell functions it not possible from the standard JS/DOM on an ad-hoc basis, is it? (Only in this way is it possible to enrich a website that mostly works without JS enabled, with certain features in cases where JS is enabled.) Note: Rumors of one or two individuals doing it with some obscure trickery does not count. It should be supported by the ecosystem as a fully fledged feature.
 Therefore, you are confined to SPAs when using Haskell/JS.
 Therefore, Haskell is simply not a suitable language for web development in general and that's just the way it is. (Apps that are legitimately SPAs only are a rare minority and that's not what I'm talking about here.)
 This is precisely where PureScript shines.
  
Someone please debunk the above, because I really would love to be wrong so I could use Haskell for everything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Zettlers,
inspirated by this thread I thought that perhaps we might be able to collect case studies successes and failures (=learning experiences!) of AI-supported knowledge work.
My hypothesis is that it is to early to move above the layer of phenomenology. The best method to access such an unknown field is trial and error.
So, I am collecting individual use cases (or perhaps even: instances). Whenever I try something I document it and leave it there. Occasionally, I will write add hypothesis to it. I will add an example to show what I mean.
If my notes on this matter reach a level that is worth publishing I will bring everything together to a document that will be available as donationware.
If you have any case study, successful interaction or failure or thoughts in general, I'd be happy if you share it.
Live long and prosper

 Then months or years later, How could refile all the done tasks under heading of Plans to GetThingsDone heading in one single command? 
 Current solution is first to use occur to popup all the done tasks "C-u M-s .*DONE.*" in a narrow to subtree window, then copy them to heading of GetThingsDone; 
 Second to delete them under Plans heading with regex in the previous narrow window.

 I'm using Company with the company-tng-mode and I would like to trigger the completion on the selected item with <return> when the completion window is open.
 This is how I configured the package
 elisp (use-package company :bind (:map company-active-map ([down] . nil) ([up] . nil) ([return] . company-complete-selection)) :config (global-company-mode t) (delete 'company-dabbrev company-backends) :custom (company-minimum-prefix-length 2) :hook (after-init . company-tng-mode) :init (setq company-dabbrev-downcase 0 company-idle-delay 0)) 
 For some reason, when the completion menu is active, I select an item and I press <return> the editor creates a newline.
 Is there something I'm doing wrong? I tried different things but I'm totally lost

 I settled on a layout that I love:
 - Capslock as Ctrl
 - Enter (when held) as Meta.
 It's symmetrical, and feels identical whether using my macbook pro's keyboard or mechanical split keyboard with array of thumb keys which would otherwise be great modifiers. Enter still works as usual newline if you tap it.
 When navigating with something like C-f, I appreciate my left hand doesn't have to move to go from C-f to M-f.
 I use Karabiner to make this possible. 
 On macos
 .config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications 
 Create a json file 
 (omit "conditions" - I use this to only apply this modification for built-in macbook keyboard. My mechanical keyboard is programmable and has it's own configuration to achieve this function which is a little smarter but same effect)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been invited by one of the contributors of org-mode to help with the documentation of org-mode Babel. Unfortunately, I'm a beginner with elisp, having spotty experience with CL only. How can I really get up to speed with elisp? What path of study would you suggest? What I've seen with elisp is that it's very close -- always seems to be getting closer -- to CL -- buuuut it has its own "best practices" realm, i.e., you can't just take your CL code and CL mentality verbatim into elisp. I've also heard that the traditional An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp hasn't really been updated to include the lexical scoping yet -- which is a game-changer that can't be avoided, i.e., you're learning/doing it wrong if you don't work with lexical scoping. Any ideas how to chart a course of study to become a competent elisper?

 I'm a product guy with non-prod-levels of previous coding experience (HTML/CSS, Python) and I'm learning Scala with the intent of making it the first language I'm proficient in to the degree that I can write software in it.
 Looking at the big picture - obviously Scala is multi-paradigm and sets me up for tackling a lot of different use cases by itself, but what language(s) do you consider to be the best ones for matching with Scala once I've mastered it?
 (I appreciate that the simplest answer to this is probably "Depends what you want to work on!" I'm still mulling my options in that sense, so getting a sense that 'Scala + x = Great prospects in y" would be incredibly helpful).
 Thanks!

  Friday 12 June 2022 8:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:47 ┄┄┄┄┄ ← now ─────────────────────────────────────────────── 12:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 16:00-20:00 Teaching 16:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 18:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 20:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 
 This can be rather confusing at a glance, as it might lead to think that I could arrange a meeting at 18:00. Moreover, it doesn't help visualizing easily how much time an activity (such as Teaching, in this case) demands. 
 How would I go from that (above) to this (below):
 Friday 12 June 2022 8:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:47 ┄┄┄┄┄ ← now ─────────────────────────────────────────────── 12:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 16:00 Teaching 18:00 Teaching 20:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 
 so I can see how much of my time is blocked by activities?
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nothing but anecdotal data, but when a newcomer is faced with a choice between Emacs or Vscode, they will very likely choose Vscode, one of the reasons being that Emacs has a rightful reputation of having a steep learning curve. The idea of having to install a dozen packages to get modern IDE-like features and write Elisp right away in order to customize them can be daunting and overwhelming. Personally, it took me a couple of years before I even bothered to start learning Elisp to become a more advanced user.
 By providing a more streamlined and user-friendly way to customize Emacs, we can help make the platform more approachable and welcoming to new users.
 One approach could be to provide a series of customizable templates or configurations that new users could choose from when first setting up Emacs. These templates could be designed for different use cases (e.g., programming, writing, project management, etc.), and could include pre-installed packages, keybindings, and other customizations that are tailored to the user's needs. This would allow new users to get started with a powerful and customized Emacs setup without having to dive too deeply into the details of Elisp code.
 Another approach could be to provide a more user-friendly interface for customizing Emacs, such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or a set of interactive prompts that guide users through the customization process. This would make it easier for users to discover and experiment with different customization options, and would help them feel more confident and in control of their Emacs setup.
 I think we need to put some work and effort on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really like corfu, especially how it can be integrated with orderless to customize candidate sorting.
 However, one thing in corfu require more effort than company is how we can select candidate with corfu-index mode. 
 In company, to select 1st candidate, I can press Alt-1, 2nd candidate is Alt-2. But in corfu, we have to press Alt-1 RET to select 1st candidate, Alt-2 RET to select 2nd one...
 Is there anyway I can configure corfu to behave like company?

 First and foremost I am super new to emacs. Specifically I am using Doom Emacs and I just got a new system up and rolling and installed Doom Emacs. I have done this many times before and have never had a problem. After Emacs is installed I usually go into the init.el to add the languages that I will be using along with editing the config.el file to change the font as well as the theme of emacs. This time I am getting an error anytime I try to open a file https://imgur.com/a/1BTOvrh - I have never seen this and I can't seem to find anything via a google search. I am sure that I haven't given enough information so if that is the case let me know and I will share anything that is needed!
 Appreciate the help in advanced.

 I started a podcast focused on Emacs and plan to release one episode a week. I've never done anything like this before, so I'm sure there's a lot of room for improvement :-). I've made a Git repository that contains the show notes, for those who aren't interested in listening to the podcast or me.
 In the fist episode, I discuss how I make use of locate, to recursively find files based on the current projects scope. You can read the episodes show notes here. Let me know if you have any questions, thanks!

I use web-mode & the typescript-language-server for my day-to-day work, so I already have an LSP server bound to `*.ts` files. What I need is some what of specifying (probably in a directory e.g. with project.el) that the project `*.ts` files I'm working on are in fact deno files and need to initialize lsp-mode with the deno language server.
 Does anyone have guidance for configuring lsp-mode to work in this situation? I effectively want the default to be my current configuration, using typescript-language-server. When I'm in a deno project, I want to use the deno language server.
 Here you can see my web-mode configuration specified for `*.ts` files:
 (use-package web-mode :ensure t :mode (("\\.ts\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.js\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.mjs\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.tsx\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.jsx\\'" . web-mode))) (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t :hook ((web-mode . lsp)))

 Dear all,
 I just want to send you all a quick note to let you know that we have an opening for a student internship, on-site at NASA Ames Research Center, this summer:
 https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000000y6o5EAA/onsite-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime
 The student, if selected, will be working on extending our capabilities to test cFS/ROS/FPrime applications, especially those using Ogma and/or Copilot for monitoring. Both Ogma and Copilot are open-source software written in Haskell.
 Applicants for this internship must be U.S. Citizens and meet a minimum 3.0 GPA requirement. Prior experience is not required. Knowledge of the following will be considered a plus: Haskell or other functional languages, C/C++, Bash, git, Docker, Linux, NASA Core Flight System, Robot Operating System, FPrime. Please note that the academic level listed in the opening is merely indicative and students at other levels (e.g., PhD) will also be considered.
 For further details, or if you have any questions, see intern.nasa.gov and the specific listing at https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000000y6o5EAA/onsite-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a set of annotations and a case class as follows:
 import scala.annotation._ class GreaterThan(level: Double) extends StaticAnnotation class SmallerThan(level: Double) extends StaticAnnotations case class Quantity(@GreaterThan(0) x: Double, u/SmallerThan(1) y: Double, n: String) 
 I would like to access each field of the case class, its type, its annotation(with value) in order to do something with this information.
 Like I would like to know that there is x in Quantity, that is Double, that is annotated with GreaterThan, where the value of the annotation is 0. 
 Is there a way to achieve that in Scala? I know reflect could achieve part of what I want, mainly the fields and the types. But the annotations .. Can't find a reference for that!
 Many thanks

I want to use emacs to write all of my php code using php-mode and all the utilities it brings but the indentation is not what I want. When I type ENTER after a function I want to write the left curly brace with the same indentation as the function definition. Something like this:
 https://preview.redd.it/fmcbgnisnjia1.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=124a72aa69244a781bf6f401b191522d6003b224
 But instead when I hit enter after defining the function the brackets are like this:

 I guess php-mode is doing this but I'd like to change it. I've tried overriding the c-set-style to "linux" and many other styles but it doesn't work. Does anyone know how to do this without rejecting php-mode and use web-mode instead? I really like php-mode.

I've tried to define this hook: (add-to-list 'org-metaup-hook (lambda () (interactive) (prog2 (transpose-lines 1) (previous-line 2)))) (add-to-list 'org-metadown-hook ⠀ (lambda () (interactive) (progn (next-line 1) (transpose-lines -1) (previous-line 1)))) But is doing strange things and I don't understand transpose-lines very well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a newb programming question, and unfortunately Googling has failed me. I see this kind of code all the time in minad's packages where an anonymous function is put inside a named function:  (defun tempel--completion-table (templates) "Return a completion table for a list of TEMPLATES. The completion table specifies the category `tempel'." (lambda (str pred action) (if (eq action 'metadata) '(metadata (category . tempel)) (complete-with-action action templates str pred))))  What would be the purpose of doing that? My guess is that the named function is later going to by applyed or apply-partiallyed, and the other function that will do the applying wants to influence the result in some variable way with an argument to the named function, and the lambda inside the named function only accepts a fixed number of arguments (because that’s how the underlying lisp code that is being hacked was written), and so there needs to be this middleman named function. 
 Am I close, or hopelessly far off? Are there any other reasons one might put a lambda inside a named function?

 The following worked...

Like many other language-specific package managers (e.g. cargo, cabal, etc.), opam

Download the sources.
Resolve the needed dependencies of a package.
Provide those dependencies such that the build system can find them.

 I cannot mix emphasis properly ie.*T*his *should* be *bold* should bold "T", "should", and "bold" but instead bolds "This should"

Prolog is unique in that it's like a database where you enter "facts" into a running REPL, then do queries on those facts in the running REPL. This means a Babel, in order to be useful, must be able in one code block to add new facts to the REPL, then give answers to a code block acting as a query. Just the normal prolog-mode will only allow you to write out a database of facts in a buffer, then pose the queries in the the running REPL -- not both together. (This is not dissimilar to any other interpreted language with code and REPL separated.) Again, Babel should offer both in the same buffer.

 For a comparison, the same file opened in gVim, with whitespace mark only at beginnings and ends of lines:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey reddit,
 from time to time my (spac)emacs is slow, which I try to resolve using the internal problem. However, it seldomly points me a in a useful direction. Most recently, one of the lags occurred when I tried opening an org-roam node using helm. Typing characters in helm was slow, so I profiled it
 ​
 CPU profling
 ​
 Memory profiling
 It points (unsuprisingly) to Helm and org-roam, whereas I was hoping that there is a third component involved (like a minor-mode) that's making problems.
 ​
 My question is essentially: How would you go from here to identify (and mitigate) potential underlying issues?
 Best,

 When I'm typing a method name, i.e. `this.myMethod`, when the company auto-complete kicks in, it seems that lsp-mode or flycheck decides that's a great time to check my code and point out problems, when I know full well I'm in the middle of typing a line of code.
  
Is this lsp-mode or company mode doing this?
 Can I tell it to wait a bit? Maybe until I'm done typing the symbol? Or even done typing the line?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because I've been concerned that emacs packages could contain exploits I've been manually auditing them all before manually installing them... This takes a long, long time to do for the hundreds of package I have installed, so I rarely update them all.
 I'd like to speed this up and ease my pain by using a package manager, but need to find one that will let me audit package before installing them. In particular, I'd like to go through diffs of package updates in ediff, and have the option of accepting our rejecting each update instead of just blindly installing it.
 Related to this, I'd also like to have the package manager store checksums (modern ones like sha256, not just git's sha1) for every version of a package I install, so that if I need to reinstall I can be assured I don't have to re-audit the code because it's exactly the same that I audited and approved earlier.
 Are there any package managers that would fit my needs?

 I'm trying to figure out how to specify, for a particular document, how to get latexmk to build using xelatex instead of pdflatex, particularly for org-beamer.
 Right now I've got:  %%% Local Variables: %%% coding: utf-8 %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-engine: xetex %%% TeX-command-extra-options: "-xetex" %%% End: 
 But this doesn't seem to do anything, looking at the org-beamer output, it's still saying ``Run number 1 of rule 'pdflatex'. 
 From what I can see, the +latexmk option imports the auctex-latexmk package, which adds latexmk to tex-commands-list and sets it as the default. So what I'm trying to figure out is how to get the -xelatex option to latexmk from emacs.
 I've tried futzing about with .latexmkrc but it seems to ignore it

 The goal of this project is to make it as easy as possible for someone with a light coding background (e.g. some experience with Python) to pick up the core ideas of Haskell quickly, without them giving up because of the unfamiliar syntax, complex types, seemingly restrictive purity, ill-documented ecosystem, and the many choices of set up. 
 In this respect, The Haskell Guide is not a tutorial, project-based guide or textbook, which aims to give a more complete walk through the language, in a linear fashion, but more like a reference guide that is carefully designed to be accessible and clear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was introduced to the world of linux and opensource softwares the previous year. At first I tried emacs because its features caught my eye. I found it hard to use at first so I decided to try something else and I found website and as of now I have some experience with vim. I use .org for taking notes. After some months I decided, I'll once again try emacs and then I found 'evil keybindings'.
 Right now I have few questions..
  
Which keybindings should I use?
 Will I need to use default emacs keybindings even if I use evil?
 Will I need to remap a lot of keys when using default emacs keybindings?
 Is one efficient over the another or is it just personal preference?
  
Hope I made my question understandable
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every-so-often I end up logging into a container for local triage. 
 Emacs is not installed by default on these images, but can be apt-gotten. However, default image size pushes the limits of the local storage. 
 I could install jed or jove or mg, but those are great VI replacements, not lightweight emacsen. These are all that google finds for me, given a range of search terms about lightweight emacs.
  
Q: Does there exist a true emacs (not work-alike) distribution that is made lighter through the separation of formerly default package into add-on libraries? For example, for my usecase, terminal-only core with python and comint and shell modes would be all I need, so I'd like to apt-get install emacs-core emacs-shell emacs-python and avoid all org-mode, mail, gnus, ... and also the graphical UI code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to upgrade the stack lts on one of my project (from lts-10.9 to lts-20.11).
 The project uses Persistent and Servant and I encounter the following issue.
 The following code
 ``haskell -- |Appis the monad stack used in the Servant Handlers. It wraps -- Servant'sHandlermonad in aReaderTmonad that holds the server's --Config` data. type App = ReaderT Config Handler
 type AppSQL = SqlPersistT App
 -- | Run & return a database query. runDB :: AppSQL a -> App a runDB query = asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query ``` doesn't compile anymore (with the following error message)
 ``` /home/max/devel/mae-website/server/src/Server.hs:49:22: error: • No instance for (unliftio-core-0.2.1.0:Control.Monad.IO.Unlift.MonadUnliftIO Handler) arising from a use of ‘runSqlPool’ • In the second argument of ‘(>>=)’, namely ‘runSqlPool query’ In the expression: asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query In an equation for ‘runDB’: runDB query = asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query | 49 | asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query |
 ^
 ```
 I understand that the "new" version of Persistent requires Servant Handler to be MonadUnliftIO which is not the case. I also understand that I am suppose to use acquireSqlConn somehowe (following this this), but I can't figure it out. Any ideas ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 So one year ago I started learning Scala. Because it's a challenge and also because I want to get to know functional programming without hopping immediately into something like Haskell. Keep in mind that my current job and all my skills are within full-stack typescript development. So Scala is definitely something else and that's also why I am so intrigued by the language. 
 But now my question is, I kinda want to move away from typescript and go the Scala way. Because I think Scala has much bigger problems to solve and the language is more mature (also because of pay).
 I am hoping to do this one year from now. I am currently learning Cats and have been reading a lot after my working hours. I recently purchased "The definitive guide" for Spark, in order to maybe spark an interest in data engineering (see what I did there).
 A lot of co-workers look weird at me when I say I have been learning scala. And they ask me why. And they think it's a waste of time (because "java is bad")
 I have been looking at jobs, and I don't see a lot of remote junior scala positions (I will be working from Belgium). As I don't have any JVM experience, I do have a passion for learning. Does this seem possible to all of you or is this a stupid idea? 
 Nevertheless, learning this language has never been a stupid idea since it has taught me so much.
 But just wanna get an opinion from some of the pros.

 I have two years of Scala experience in the industry, and I have some career gap now and studying Scala and so on.
 Is the portfolio still important and something must have for future interview? or should I just concentrate in coding interview? What do yo think?
 I'm not sure where should I concentrate on first.
 For the portfolio, if I have to make, I'm thinking of some web app written in some nice looking code with cats effect like that.
 Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

involving data types such as real numbers, arrays or strings. They use various

SMT solvers are particularly good at what they do, and are thus often used as

Haskell, which provides formal verification of Haskell

often rely on SMT-LIB, a language that allows the expression of the basic

Is it possible to create an O(n) run time algorithm in Haskell for this problem? 
 I can create an algorithm in C to solve this problem, but the only algorithm that I came up with modifies the input array which is something that I don't think I would do if I was programming for someone else.

 Should I stick withe GHC 8.10 (and use lts-18.28) or should I upgrade to GHC 9.*.
 My problem with GHC 9 is that ,GHC 9.0 might have some bugs in it, but the going to GHC 9.4 might means less library are available to stackage. 
 I don't really need any of the fancy new stuff, I'm just upgrading to keep up to date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am more and more in situation when I have to use compact and laptop keyboards witch chiclet keys. I have no issue with flat chiclet keyboards, except of the typical layout of the last row. 
 Two examples, the upper one is a laptop keyboard, the bottom one is a compact desktop keyboard.
 https://preview.redd.it/hgsa2xfz0yha1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=824cc12df8fc5dce11ffeac1d4239f160d101eec
 Other features, common in Europe, are a short <shift> on the left side and a narrow two row <enter>.
 I need to figure out how to use them with emacs efficiently and possibly ergonomically. I am used to use a standard keyboard and my palm to press <Ctrl> but this clearly doesn't work here. 
 How do you type on keyboards like this? Did you change your typing habits? How do you use <Ctrl> and <Alt> on the right side next to the arrow block? What fingers do you use to press them? Do you change the keyboard or command map?
 Any hint and experience is welcomed.

 A couple of weeks ago I posted about how I think that Erlang/OTP's behaviours are more fundamental than lightweight processes and message passing when it comes to building reliable distributed systems.
 The post got a couple of comments, including one from Robert Virding (one of the Erlang creators), basically saying that one needs lightweight processes and message passing to in order to implement behaviours, even though I sketched an implementation that doesn't use lightweight processes at the end of the post.
 Anyway, this inspired me to start working on a follow up post where I flesh things out in more detail. This post quite isn't ready yet, but I've finished a first Haskell prototype implementation which I'd like to share:

 As usual I'd be curious to hear your thoughts!

 I need to submit a summary of a series of events to a lawyer, and I wrote it up in an eleven page org document as it was most natural. Now I am trying to export it into a PDF file, because he is not going to know what to do with an org file or even a text file for that matter. The problem is, I need it to remain a nested outline, and not have nodes converted to headings. 
 It seems that a good approach is to export it to an HTML file first, and then convert the HTML file to PDF later. To do this, I thought about using AWK, but it would take too long to learn and perform. I was also looking at using some python with beautiful soup, which might work, although uncertain. Then, there is always the masochistic approach of editing the file by hand. I know sed might do the trick, but my sed pants are not big enough to tackle that one. 
 Help me, please...

 It is our great pleasure to announce the first OSS release of guardian, a dependency boundary constraint checker for Haskell monorepo!
 https://github.com/deepflowinc/guardian
 If you have a trouble with Haskell monorepo with increasing complexity of the package dependencies, then guardian could help the situation! It is developed at DeepFlow, Inc. and has been used almost for two years.
 With guardian, you can divide the packages into several "domains", and define the allowed dependency between those domains. Guadian will make sure that the only predefined dependencies between domains are introduced by package dependencies and report the result.
 For more details and motivation, please refer to README.
 Thanks!

 So far I have used the lts-20 as resolver for my project and it worked fine. Since amaonka supports only ghc 8.10.7 I used lts-18.28 as resolver. 
 I'm using Mac m1 Monterey (12.6.2). I installed llvm@12 via brew and when I type clang --version I get the following output. 
 Homebrew clang version 12.0.1 Target: arm64-apple-darwin21.6.0 Thread model: posix InstalledDir: /opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@12/bin 
 Any suggestions on how to fix this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built an interpreter in Haskell for a made-up language, but what I actually want to build is a compiler for it, which means that everything must be mapped to machine code and do the whole 3-address-code and assign address rooms for variables and so on. What I'm not sure about is how I want to go about that.
 This isn't a question related only to Haskell, but I'm more interested to hear what you guys have to say about that and which approach is best to follow and whether you could recommend some resources for me to read and go through, thanks!

 I have been working on this for several months now, but in this version I cleaned up a bunch of the types and made the library much less painful to use. It's still very new and has very few users, so there's probably some bugs in it.
 The usage instructions are in the readme

 I found that some other people had similar issue, but with melpa I believe, and they solved it by putting this at the top of the init.el file:
 (setq gnutls-algorithm-priority "NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3") 
 It didn't however solve my issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a problem with my org-habit consistency graph. Mainly, I do not understand how it works.
 I have a habit which repeats every day and I mark it "DONE" on that day if I have compeleted it. If I do not, I don't change it's state.
 I have done it for 6 times during the past 2 weeks and this is my agenda org file contents for that habit:
 * TODO EXAMPLE SCHEDULED: <2023-02-12 Sun +1d> :PROPERTIES: :CATEGORY: EXAMPLE :STYLE: habit :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-02-12 Sun 20:17] :END: - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-12 Sun 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-11 Sat 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-10 Fri 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-05 Sun 20:15] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-04 Sat 20:15] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-03 Fri 20:15] 
 But when I open my org-agenda weekly view I see this:
 Here for example, all the days that were "DONE" are marked as "DONE" but they have different colors. I would like to see blue bar on the days that it was done and red bar for the days it was not.
 Also, could I assign different colors for different keywords?
 I would like "DONE" to be blue, "NOT DONE" to be red, "DELAYED" to be yellow and such.
 Right now, every keyword that is logged is marked as "DONE" in the consistency graph here and has different coloring even though all the states are "DONE".
 I am using Doom Emacs and org-super-agenda
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read NixOS documentation and Nix package manager specific docs about the way to configure packages (specifically Emacs since there are sections reserved for it) and everywhere it assumes we are using a global configuration .nix file or home-manager which I'm not using since I'm on openSUSE.
 My configuration goes in ~/.emacs.d and it only picks up my early-init.el (it wasn't being picked up in ~/.config/emacs for some reason) and nothing from my init.el which includes downloading packages through package.el and I'm sensing Nix wants to manag them.
 So I'm wondering how should I configure Emacs or if Nix expects a config .nix file (and where) or if it's a bit of both ways? How do you configure Emacs if you are not in NixOS and you installed it via Nix?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to all!
 I don't know about you, but sometimes with embark I need to insert something into the minibuffer, not the main buffer. That is, I do for example M-x cp/consult-ripgrep-with-directory (personal command that calls consult-ripgrep but asks where to search before with a folder path), and there I need a directory. So I do M-x in the minibuffer (see enable-recursive-minibuffers) and type consult-recent-file, remove the filename to get the folder name... and then I want to insert what I have in the previous minibuffer. My problem is that embark-insert only allows inserting into the main current buffer... 
 Same problem when I know that I need the path of a bookmark.
 How do you do this guys ? Have you an idea to resolve this issue ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I got to know about Babashka, I realized that it is something I've been looking for in Emacs.
 It brings to mind Emacs ludicruous speed which is another way of prepping emacs configurations for fast startup.
 Would the combination of native compilation, emacs ludicruous speed and some of the features of Emacs 29 make an Emacs version of Babashka a practical thing?

 I've reinstalled my emacs with
  brew install emacs-mac --with-dbus\ --with-starter\ --with-librsvg\ --with-imagemagick\ --with-natural-title-bar\ --with-emacs-big-sur-icon\ --with-native-comp\ --with-mac-metal\ --with-xwidgets 
 And this thing started to appeared above my completion ui. I use corfu, but I don't think this is caused by it. More interestingly, after I set (tool-bar-mode -1), this ui no longer appears.
 But I want tool-bar, is there any method to turn it off without setting (tool-bar-mode -1)? I've google it but I cannot find anything related.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I want to give emacs another shot. Last time I tried it, I attempted to make my own config, and I installed some packages and whatnot, along with evil mode.
 It felt really sluggish and slow, it even paused while I typed due to the LSP plugin. I didn't really like it. Plus, evil mode made the entire experience very inconsistent. I love vim keybindings, but emacs is not just a text editor, and that's kind of the appeal of it, and emacs is built around its own keybindings, so trying to force vim ones on it just makes a mess really...
 So how usable is emacs as a text editor with the default ones? Having to reach for control all the time sounds annoying, although I guess I could replace caps lock for control, since that's far more reachable. How fast are you editing text with it? Do you prefer it over vim keybinds?
 People like the guy in the "tsoding" channel use emacs without evil mode, and he can type quite fast. Any tips about this?

 I'm trying to start a scala project. I tried to setup a basic environment project: I've installed metals as a vscode extensions, and I've installed scala and sbt from coursier like official scala docs. 
 Metals create lot of directories which I don't know what the are used for. Sbt also do that when creating a project with it. It was a bit overwhelming, so I just flush those and tried to start with the simplest dev environment I could get. 
 Well, I couldn't resolve a single custom package, so I just reset the regular way metals and sbt wanted it to be. Still can't resolve custom packages, unless the file is at the project root. 
 Is it "normal" to feel lost with the dev environment, or am I missing some point ? Is there some exhaustive-ish resources you would recommand to get started with scala ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally posted to the emacs stack exchange here, but figured id ask here as well!
 When I narrow to a subheading in emacs, I would love for it to be displayed as if it was the top level as opposed to it staying the level it actually is.
 For example consider this tree
 * Heading 1
 ** Heading 2
 *** Heading 3
 **** Heading 4
 ***** Heading 5
 foobar...
 In my emacs displays it more like this:
 * Heading 1
 _* Heading 2
 __* Heading 3
 ___* Heading 4
 ___* Heading 5 foobar...
 And if I narrow to heading 4 it displays like this:
 ___* Heading 4
 ____* Heading 5 foobar...
 However I would like it to display like as a 'top level' header like this:
 * Heading 4
 _* Heading 5 foobar...
 And when I wide, for it to display normally again.
 I'm very new to emacs, but I haven't found anyone else with this issue when searching, which suggests that either I'm doing something wrong or everyone is fine with it as is!
 If the latter is the case, I know overlays could potentially provide an solution but I'm very new to lisp (and especially elisp) so I have no idea whether it's even possible or not.
 I'm using the following version(s) of emacs on windows. I can attach my configs if needed!
 GNU Emacs v28.2 nil
 Doom core v3.0.0-pre HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD e96624926 2023-01-01 21:55:13 -0500

 I installed Emacs using rpm-ostree and the command line version runs fine, loading the doom configuration as it should from .config/emacs and .config/doom. But the gui version does not run well with the doom configs - the window is initially black, and it only intermittently accepts keystrokes. If I disable my configs by running emacs -Q, the window opens and responds fine, there's just no doom goodness.
 I would appreciate any suggestions!

 I looked through the code of both erc-desktop-notifications.el and erc-notify.el and neither of these packages support this feature.
 It seems that I could potentially edit the erc-notifications-PRIVMSG function from erc-desktop-notifications.el to add the desired feature, however I am not able to figure out how to detect the current channel name from this function.
 I was wondering if anybody knows of a way that this can be done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a begginer at Haskell, but lately at work I have to read and modify lots of haskell codes. The general context is you have lots of data (just imagine excel table), and the codes usually try to compute something from these data, but when data contains error, we want these computation to revert to a simpler form,
 Example: you have function that multiply a column A by 2 and put the result in a new column B, but when data contains error, I want this function to just put 0 in new column B. 
 What would be a good global strategy to modify the codes? , since there are tons of these functions, I don't want to modify them individually. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FYI. It looks like ruff (a pretty fast python linter) just work with flymake out of the box.
  (add-hook 'python-base-mode-hook 'flymake-mode) (setq python-flymake-command '("ruff" "--quiet" "--stdin-filename=stdin" "-") 
 If you are using Eglot, you have to add it to the diagnostic functions:
  (add-hook 'eglot-managed-mode-hook (lambda () (cond ((derived-mode-p 'python-base-mode) (add-hook 'flymake-diagnostic-functions 'python-flymake nil t)) ;; if not adding diagnostic functions to other modes just use an if ;; ... (t nil)))) 
 Also if you are in Emacs 29 shellchek just works on bash scripts. All that is needed is to enable it:
  (setq-default sh-shellcheck-arguments "-x") ; follow sourced libraries (add-hook 'sh-base-mode-hook 'flymake-mode) ; requires shellcheck 
 Hope this helps someone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Scheme you simply do a define for everything where you want to assign a name to a form. In CL you have many options (visit the zoo). So what is the best practice for elisp? For example I see setq, which seems generic, i.e., you can define a new symbol or update an existing one with setq (e.g., change a nil to t). So, e.g., how would I attach a name to a lambda anonymous function in elisp? Again, with Scheme it's simply put define in front of it. Once again, how much of CL do we, can we bring over to elisp?

 So I want to be able to somehow switch the 'git' user on the fly to switch between the 'git' user to push stuff to my personal GitHub repos vs my GitHub user for my work stuff.
 I have two separate GitHub accounts (one for work and one for personal stuff).
 How can I easily configure this in Emacs?
 Is this more of an Emacs config thing, or can I swap them out on the fly with the use of an interactive Hydra or something?
 Please link to any related guide if you can, since I can't seem to figure this out. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have a really well working lsp configuration for Scala? When I say well working I mean in contrast to mine that isn't that bad but has some problems:
 - Jump to definition works 95% of the times
 - Search symbol in workspace works 70% of the times and sometimes throws an overflow (?) error
 - I do not have the fancy intellij functions that find all subtypes for example or generally play with the type hierarchy
 - Many commands just fail saying that metals is not supporting the executeCommand command and I should check the capabilities of the session in which there actually is an executeCommandProvider with many commands reported available which do not work in reality
 ​
 Is metals just bad or have I possibly missconfigured it?

I had a DropBox fiasco this week. For some reason, all my zettelkaten files, on my office mac suddenly have a 3 Feb 2023 timestamp, both the modified and the created. The files on my shop laptop remain unchanged. But I'm worried and have temporarily turned off DropBox syncing. I've started a super-top-secret coding project that uses these file parameters and am worried my file's timestamps will get mucked with.
Oh well.
I spent a ton of time this week learning about manipulating python dictionaries. In the coming week, I'll be looking at html and css tools.
I'm really happy that my zettels are non-zettelkasting and life-focused.

 I'm considering which database library to use for a production system. For now I wanted to use persistent, however stumbled upon beam and it looks nicer to me. I've seen this post, however most of it is about persistent, and I didn't find how they differ in real production life. What I'm interested in is how do they compare in terms of 
  
features
 type safety
 scaling
 performance
 migrations
 productivity
 overall production readiness / adoption
  
I'm not afraid of a bit complexity, but I definitely hate TH / generated code. I'm keen on trying beam, but I'm just not sure if it's a right choice for a production system. Can someone more experienced with both libraries give their thoughts / opinions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last couple weeks while putting the treesit-auto package together it gained adoption much faster than I had expected. While I'm incredibly happy others found it useful, that also means that many assumptions in my hacky code were quickly blown apart. Also, in no small part due to my poor documentation, it was confusing to figure out exactly how/what would be supported when trying to add a new language.
 The key learning since I first tried to launch this package is that there's no reason for the grammar name in grammar.js to match the Emacs major mode, and there's a possibility that there are many "fallback" modes that should upgrade to the tree-sitter version, rather than just one. For these reasons and more, I needed to adjust the structure of how these modes are described internally alongside their grammars. As a consequence to that, some of the public functions/variables have been changed or removed. 
 I am sorry to anyone who has already picked up the package and started tweaking it. However, I think the changes will make the package more maintainable down the line, and it’s better to do this sooner rather than later. Most folks will probably not notice a difference if all you have set is treesit-auto-install and global-treesit-auto-mode. 
 Hopefully this is the last post I will need/want to to make about the package!
 TL;DR
 treesit-auto-fallback-alist no longer has any affect. If you want another language to be supported by treesit-auto, there is now a guide for contributing recipes

 and
 #+begin_src nix :noweb-ref A :noweb-ref B google-chrome-dev #+end_src

 but this isn't very DRY and I'm fixating on this atm.
 Did a few websearches and even prompted GPT-3 but no dice. I think I need a human expert. 🙊
 # TL;DR
 For my home-manager Nix config, I am tangling a package name `google-chrome-dev` into the package listing `home.packages` (location A) and also to the `nixpkgs.config.allowUnfreePredicate` function body (location B) which just maintains a manifest of non-FLOSS packages that I want to clear for installation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 For many years, my Org workflow has depended on the Agenda's ability to display entries that have active timestamps in the :PROPERTIES: drawer. As of version 9.5.5 this is working fine for me, as it always has. 
 However, I remember a discussion on the Org developer list some months back that the developers planned to remove this feature at some point in the future. I cannot, however, locate the thread where I read that. A search of this Reddit forum does not mention this matter either. 
 So, I thought I'd ask specifically: Is it true that the Agenda is going to lose its ability to act upon active timestamps in the :PROPERTIES: drawer?
 If true, that would be very unfortunate for me. But I want to be prepared if it happens. I see nothing about this matter in the Release Notes for Org 9.6, so I surmise it's safe for me to upgrade -- for now. 
 Many thanks for reading, and to all the Org developers for Org mode, which is a work of genius.

 I started with the coursera class, however a team member told me that this class was going way too deep and that I wont be using anything learnt with it (the code is "easy" scala, without expert concepts). However, I have also been told that a team member was coding poorly because he kept coding like we would do with imperative programming (using loops and coding in a way where several lines could be simplified with one or two by programming the way scala is supposed to be used). 
 So I'm kind of stuck because I'm being told that the coursera class is going too deeply, but I still have to find a tutorial so that I dont end programming in scala like I would do with an imperative langage. What can I do ? What do you suggest ?

Now that I've reached an almost definitive config (yeah, right!) I would like to rearrange the different sections by grouping them under a same parent heading, moving them around, etc. Is there a built-in way (or a package) that would show me the TOC for my file and allow me to sort the file contents by just moving the headings in that TOC around?
 How would you go about doing this? (bear in mind the file is quite large now)
 Thanks in advance for your help.

 This is not the same as simply adding a timestamp, something much easier (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/32150/how-to-add-a-timestamp-to-each-entry-in-emacs-messages-buffer).
 Today I am getting the following error and I have no idea where it's coming from, and it's frustrating.
 Error processing message (file-missing "Cannot open load file" "No such file or directory" "company"). [2 times] 
 That's just one of a ton of different sorts of errors over the years that were unhelpful due to lack of indication where the fault is. I've learned to write all my error messages with more background info, but we can't expect every package author to do this.
 Any ideas on the necessary architecture? I guess the C source needs a patch, but can we do it in such a way that we don't need to update the calling convention i.e. so we don't need package authors to update every message sexp in their codebases?

 I'm trying to create a DEADLINE on every last day of the month with the following entry:
 * TODO Pay something DEADLINE: <2023-01-31 Tue +1m -3d> 
 But I noticed when marked as done, it does not go to the next month's last day, which in this case is 2023-02-28. So I googled some answers and the only one that I found was this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/31683/schedule-org-task-for-last-day-of-every-month
 Using the mentioned function:
 * TODO Pay something DEADLINE: <%%(diary-last-day-of-month '(1 31 2023))> 
 Which works perfectly, but I want it to be repeated.
 Did you guys know some way to schedule/deadline that repeats on every last day of the month?

It works as expected initially, then I run into two problems:
  
At start up, sending a really large input will show Data.Binary.Get.runGet at position 32: not enough bytes.
 When sending multiple small inputs, I eventually get RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds. I see this happening in the hs.free() JS call, the hs.malloc() JS call, or the malloc Haskell call
  
Printing out the pointers shows that the input pointer uses the same memory address every time, and the result pointer isn't continually increasing, so it doesn't seem like a memory leak. Regardless, the pointers + length are well below the size of hs.memory.buffer.
  
How do I go about debugging this? I've never worked this low-level before, and I'm not really sure how to start
 I've attached the relevant files below; am I doing anything obviously wrong?

 Anyone know when this changed, and why?
 EDIT: to partially answer my own question. I see that starting with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Gnu Emacs was replaced with mg. Catalina was released in October 2019. I don't know anything about Mg but it seems like a neat project.
 If I were to guess the "why", I'd say it has to do with licensing?

Why would I want to run a NixOS virtual machine on macOS?
My colleague at Tweag, Dominic Steinitz, asked me this question after I shared
my first minor achievement in this area, and it struck me that I have never
described why exactly I run virtual machines (VMs) on my laptop and why I want
to make it easier for myself (and others).
Like many members of the Nix community – more than 25% according to the Nix
community survey – I rely on macOS to provide me a stable
shiny desktop environment. However NixOS is based on Linux and so many pieces
that are used for developing and testing it require running it in VMs. I’ll
describe some major use cases for it below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/haskell. Almost ten years ago, I wrote a version of the boardgame Yinsh in Haskell. The project included a web-based frontend and a backend for the computer opponent. Everything was running just fine (on my website) until a few weeks ago when Heroku shut down its free tier, where I was hosting the backend.
 Since then, I made multiple unsuccessful attempts to resurrect the game somehow (for example: compiling either the frontend or the backend). The main problem is that I have been developing in other programming languages and ecosystems since then and I'm not familiar with the modern Haskell stack anymore. But it would be sad to rewrite the project in another language. Haskell was actually a really nice fit for this project.
 Back then, I was using Haste to compile Haskell to JavaScript for the frontend part. But now I fail to properly restore the environment to make the hastec call work. Also, I'm not sure if Haste is still actively maintained.
 The backend was 'plain' Haskell, but I have trouble setting up an environment where I can use ghc to compile the backend. I have an old .cabal file that I was apparently using to deploy the backend to Heroku, but it seems that too many things have changed since then.
 I could probably try harder to restore that old state somehow, but I think what the project really needs is some kind of ecosystem modernization. I would be very glad to hear your suggestions on how to move on. If someone is interested in the project itself, I would also love to take contributions on https://github.com/sharkdp/yinsh.
 Yinsh, by the way, is a really fun abstract board game (two player, zero sum, perfect information) which is similar to Gomoku/"Five-in-a-row". As far as I know, there is no other implementation of Yinsh out there that features an 'AI' opponent (my implementation uses a classical minimax-style search in the game tree).

 Is there a way to specify the EDITOR environment variable to something which would open a new emacs buffer? I use vterm inside emacs, so if I run a command which calls the default Editor, emacs freezes. I am not really surprised that this happens since this looks "recursive". Does somebody know how I can work around that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 Related Setup:
  
Emacs running via WSL2 with Ubuntu on Windows 10
  
​
 Related Issue:
  
Copy text from Windows 10 and pasting into Emacs via 'C-y' Emacs keybinding totally works as intended to paste stuff into Emacs
 However, I cannot do the reverse: 
 Ex: I cannot copy and paste text from Emacs using selecting text in Emacs, hitting 'M-w' in Emacs to copy it to the clipboard buffer, and then just click 'Paste' wherever I want in Windows 10
 
  
​
 Related Research I Tried:
  
I tried referring to this guide page: 
 https://shelper.github.io/posts/setup-emacs-in-wsl2/
 
 However, the 'copy paste sharing between wsl2 and windows host' section just says you can use 'GWSL' above.
 However, I referred to that section, and found the related 'GWSL-Source' GitHub repo and its associated Windows store link: 
 https://github.com/Opticos/GWSL-Source
 https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/gwsl/9NL6KD1H33V3?hl=en-us&gl=us&cid=storebadge&ocid=badge&rtc=1
 
  
​
 Question:
  
Can anyone confirm how this works for the clipboard manager?
 From your related YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6GXBEQ5KzA), it looks like you can easily launch GUI programs from various Linux distros all from Windows 10 etc which is really really cool
 But, it doesn't really show how the clipboard functionality would work.
  
​
 Thanks!

 I was typesetting a document that I want to be exported to html and latex, and I'm using the latex package bussproofs in it (for derivation trees but the exact package is besides the point) that package, like many others is available in MathJax v3.2 but org html export uses MathJax v2.7.
 I tried customizing a bit the template so that it would load MathJax v3.2 but it didn't work(I can edit to elaborate on what I tried) so here is my question.
 How could it be done?
 Is there any reason for it to use v2 over v3?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I experience the following anoying behavior: If the text in the minibuffer get's longer then the display width and lines are therefore continued on the next line, the minibuffer scrolling no longer works.
 What I mean by that is that it "logically" works as when I press <down> or <up> the indicator correctly displays the number of the item I am supposed to choose when pressing <RET> yet I can't visually see what I would select.
 First I thought it is a marginalia issue but that's not the case. With marginalia it only shows much more easily as marginalia adds text to minibuffer entries thus making lines longer. So this is a thing I can easily reproduce when making the whole Emacs window narrow enough to trigger continuation lines in the minibuffer.
 Seems to be an issue with the highlight line logic and scrolling? Report it as a bug?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been taking notes in org-roam and publishing them online for my own use. It's worked really well and has been immensely valuable. I did run into something today that was a puzzle--I knew I'd taken a note on a topic, couldn't find it easily and didn't have access to my home machine. My thought: I'd be fine if I could search everything for the word 'awk'.
 I'm thinking the following would be elegant:
  
Index the notes generated by org-publish using sqlite's FTS5 capability.
 Add a search field to the generated sitemap.
 Update the publishing script to copy the indexed database along with the notes.
 Write a CGI to handle the searches and link to search results.
  
Minus the CGI part it was stupidly easy to get indexing with stemming working:
 #!/bin/sh sqlite3 t.db<<EOF CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE notes USING FTS5(title, body, tokenize=porter); EOF for file in $(ls *html | grep -v sitemap) do data=$(cat $file | sed "s/'/''/g") sqlite3 t.db<<EOF INSERT INTO notes(title, body) VALUES('$file','$data'); EOF done 
 I did run into one ugly that I need an elegant idea to help solve--indexing the generated HTML leads to poor search results (e.g. searching for `awk' finds every note due to the export language boilerplate). I've had the following thoughts:
  
index the org files. Downside: this will pickup the #* lines which works poorly for some searches (e.g. session).
 use an HTML parser (e.g. Beautiful Soup) and carve content out of the generated files. Intuitively, this seems like it would be brittle.
 publish to text as well, index those and associate the results with its HTML counterpart.
 use some combinations of org-export filters to index the content.
  
As an aside, I realize there are services for this but there's no fun in that.

 Is this a result of bitrot? Or do I have weird interactions with another package?
 I've been adding debugging messages, and truly it seems that the directory variables don't get updated when you navigate across the directory tree...
 Anybody else seeing the same behavior?

 :var myvar=mydir/my.org:mytable 
 Problem with this approach is that i have lots of tables, and sometimes i need to pass 5-6 at a time, so i had to write 
 :var myvar1a=mydir/my.org:mytable1a :var myvar1b=mydir/my.org:mytable1b :var myvar2a=mydir/my.org:mytable2a :var myvar2b=mydir/my.org:mytable2b :var myvar3a=mydir/my.org:mytable3a :var myvar3b=mydir/my.org:mytable3b ... 
 etc, i would love to be able to just use
 mypythonfunction(tbls=['mytable1a', 'mytable2a']), etc 
 Or even
 mypythonfunction(tabletype='all table_a') 
 I considred merging all remoute tables in one, but it won't work cause they have different structure between types (table A, table B) and even with same type they can be a bit different. So it won't work.
 This suggestion looks promissing, but it's for local tables, is it possible to adjust it to make it work with remote files? So i can
 :var myvar=mydir/my.org 
 And then
 mypythonfun(myvar, tabletouse=''table1a") 
  
This is what i use now
 #+BEGIN_SRC python :var vara=data/my.org:table_a :var varb=data/my.org:table_b :var varc=data/my.org:table_c :hlines no :colnames no :results value table :return ttout import scripts.bimp_figures as bf ttout = bf.calcrtn (vara, varb, varc)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 
 I am trying to use data from a JSON to fill in an HTML template. I have decided to use hamlet from yesod, but I am opened to easier-to-use alternatives.
 I am struggling with defining correct types to make it through typechecks ... :D
 Given such JSON (shortened from what I am working with):
 test.json
  {"parameters": [ {"name": "name", "required": true}, {"name": "limit", "max": 10} ] } 
 If I parse the JSON with aeson like:
 ``` newtype Parameters = Parameters { parameters :: [Parameter] } deriving (Show, Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON)
 data Parameter = Parameter { name :: Text , required :: Bool , maxValue :: Maybe Integer } deriving (Show, Generic, ToJSON)
 instance FromJSON Parameter where parseJSON = withObject "parameter" $ \param -> do name <- param .: "name" required <- param .: "required" maxValue <- values .:? "max" return ( Parameter { .. } )
 newtype Parameters = Parameters { parameters :: [Parameter] } deriving (Show, Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON)
 template :: Parameters -> Html template parameters = [shamlet| $doctype 5 <html> <body> <h1> Page generated from the JSON data source <table>
  <tbody> $forall Parameter name required maxValue <- parameters <tr> <td> <p> <code>#{name}</code> $maybe realRequired <- required <span style="color: red">REQUIRED</span> $maybe maxInput <- maxValue <li><strong>max:</strong> #{maxInput} 
 |] ```
 I am getting an error (rightfully so I guess) that the types don't match -- the template expects all it's inputs with the type Text, but I have multiple -- some are simple types like Integer, others are Maybe Integer or even Value (they can be either string or integer).
 How can I satisfy the hamlet template constraints? Should I go about it differently?
 I can add full code if neccessary, it's not long, I just don't want to make this question longer than it already is :D
 Thank you for any help with this :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm writing some content for a game that has its own data file format. So I figured I'd whip up a derived mode for it to make things easier.
 The problem is that the game engine only uses tabs for indentation, and nothing I've tried has managed to get that working.
 Here's the behavior I want when in this major mode: hitting the tab key inserts a tab character at the beginning of the line. If that can't happen, I'll settle for hitting the tab key inserts a tab character at the cursor. I'm not concerned right now with behavior during region operations.
 I also want to define keywords and use font-lock to highlight those (and strings).
 How do you get that working in a derived mode? Or is it the sort of thing that would be easier to do by writing a mode from scratch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title should actually be that imenu for org mode is broken in emacs 28.2
 I have a big org file. When calling imenu, it will only contain a few dozen entries that I can jump to and no more. It doesn't contain any entry after some point in the file. What's more it doesn't parse the headlines correctly as shown on screenshots
 When I use imenu command, then press tab for completion, it will autofill a * , then will show me dozens of entries starting with a star:
  
Abc
  
** ABCD
 *** Thing
 ******Stuff
 When on a working version, pressing tab will only show me the first level of org headlines, the topmost level, to choose from.
 This happens with emacs 28.2 started with -Q This works perfectly fine with emacs 26.2 started with -Q
 I tried updating the org mode that comes with emacs to 9.6.1 but that doesn't change a thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just created a package related to notetaking, hoping that it would be useful to others as well. It can be found here, https://github.com/chatziiola/klp, still in its infancy. The problem is that, using the snippet I have in the readme file, I get an error that the package can not be loaded (even though it gets properly downloaded). If I load it manually, it works, but it is unacceptable.
 I must have done something wrong when writing the package, but since it is my very first one, I do not know where to look for more info. 
 Installation Snippet:
  (use-package klp :straight (:host github :repo "chatziiola/klp") :init (setq klp/static-notes-dir "~/path/to/dir")) 
 Error
  Error (use-package): Cannot load klp Disable showing Disable logging 
 Manual loading command
  (load "path/to/klp.el") 
 I do not need a solution. I tried following the information I found online, related to package creation but I know I have a long way to go. Suggestions on where to look or possible points of failure are more than welcome.
 EDIT: I used the (setq debug-on-error t) command in my init.el to have more data for you but the error remained the same.
 EDIT 2: Corrected the installation command

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if this is an issue for anyone else, but when I use lsp-java, emacs becomes very prone to crashing and I have to kill the whole process and restart emacs to recover. When it's not crashing emacs, the lsp loves to make very strange formatting decisions for me. For example, I'll get to the end of a line, then I put the semicolon and suddenly the line gets partially deleted. And if I undo that, it returns to normal, but put the semicolon back causes the deletion again. Not to mention the seemingly random indenting of lines that it likes to do. Does anyone else have this issue? Is lsp-java really this poorly made?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like what ghcup project and what they do, I think it is a fantastic tool for many people. But since I am using NixOS mostly, and I also use nix flakes for projects, I often use these buildInputs for devShells instead:
 nix devShells.default = with pkgs; mkShell { buildInputs = [ cabal-install haskell.compiler.ghc94 haskell.packages.ghc94.haskell-language-server hlint stylish-haskell # ... other packages ]; }; }); 
 If you wish to have a specific version pin down you could even do:
 nix haskell.compiler.ghc944 haskell.packages.ghc944.haskell-language-server 
 However, this often leads to building the entire haskell.packages.ghc94.haskell-language-server since the official cache doesn't have it. I am wondering, if there is enough people doing the same thing, if so it may be a good way to share resource and have different versions of ghc and their HLS-es built and cached as a untrusted substitutor?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title,
 I am using eglot + pyright for only 1 week, and i love it (great improvement over my pre lsp days :)), features that are most usuful to me are variable/function highlightning, xref-find-definitions, eglot-rename, etc. But i am unhappy with performance, sometimes it's relively fast, but often (usually after i edit variable or function name) it can get to lagging state when everything is very slow, highlightning does not work (forget about autocomplete), etc. I have only 7 files in project, so it should not happen i think?
 1, usually what's the reasons for lags? Is it eglot/client/device side or is it server/pyright/internetspeed side?
 2, is it good idea to try to turn off some features? which are most resource hungry/less useful? i was thinking to turn off error checking while i am in "creation mode" and turn it when i am ready to clean up. 
 3, did anyone try lsp bridge? how did you like it?
 Here is my init.el
 (use-package eglot :ensure t :defer t :bind (:map eglot-mode-map ("M-f" . xref-find-definitions) ("M-F" . xref-go-back) ("M-r" . eglot-rename) ("M-t" . xref-find-references) ("M-j" . flymake-goto-next-error) ("M-J" . flymake-goto-prev-error)) :config (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(python-mode . ("pyright-langserver" "--stdio"))) :custom (eglot-autoshutdown t) (eglot-events-buffer-size 50000) (eglot-send-changes-idle-time 3) (flymake-no-changes-timeout 5) (eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p nil) (setq eglot-ignored-server-capabilities '( :documentHighlightProvider)) :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) ) 
 I tried looking at eglot events buffer, but didn't find any clues on lags.
 Update: here is the list of capabilities that can be disabled

 I'm trying to setup my Django environment using pylsp, corfu and although i manage to setup everything ok, i now get two minibuffers with completion-at-point popups. I've been trying to figure out how to find which packages are being used by the functions but describing-functions or -variables don't seem to point me anywhere other than the source file and the description. What am i missing?

 Just want to get rid of the one in the background but it would be nice to learn how to trace this functions.

 I've been using Emacs for about a year now, and it's single-handedly the best program I have ever used. It has ultimate extensibility, and it's just the perfect tool for so many tasks.
 Among those tasks however, I want to add note-taking, could someone please help me find a method that fits this criteria?
 I want to write notes in markdown, be able to see and use these notes on mobile through a sync client like Nextcloud, have bi-directional link support, and maybe some tags.

 I first tried using org-roam with the md-roam, but I don't really like the node system that it creates, or the IDs for each file, I feel like it's almost locking me into a sort of org-roam ecosystem, I prefer something more like a tree approach, with folders and subfolders for different categories.
 I think what I'm trying to replicate is basically the functionality that a program like Notion gives, but in Emacs.
 ​
 What suggestions would you guys have? Any and all would be greatly appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 I'm happy to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.1!
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!!
 This is probably the largest release to the Yampa project in a decade: The unit tests for all of Yampa's public API are now complete. Many of the new tests are implemented using QuickCheck, and care has been taken, whenever possible, to express the properties based on the continuous-time (FRP) interpretation of Yampa's primitives and combinators.
 Hopefully, this battery of tests will help speed up the process of accepting new features and changes, and will free resources that can be dedicated to investigating other issues.

 This is part of my config:

 When opening "*.ts" file, typescript-mode is enabled and eglot too. OK for me.
 But when opening "*.js" file, javascript-mode is enabled and eglot does not launch: I have to M-x eglot in order to have eglot launched.
 What is wrong with my config?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understandably not everyone wants auto-formatting to be all-or-nothing, previously only formatting the entire buffer was supported, so if someone wanted to auto-format a single block or function it wasn't possible.
 Now two new commands have been added:
  
elisp-autofmt-region auto-format the selection.
 
elisp-autofmt-region-dwim auto-format the selection, using the surrounding/adjacent S-expression when there is no selection.
 
 This makes it useful as an editing feature for emacs-lisp, so you can paste code and format it, wrapping by the fill-column, removing unnecessary space & indenting.
 It's available on melpa as elisp-autofmt, see: elisp-autofmt for details.
  
Example for reference:
 Unformatted text:
 (defun hl-indent-scope--next-sexp-by-syntax (end level) (let ((found nil) (pos-init (point))) (cond (hl-indent-scope-show-block-fn (while (and (hl-indent-scope--search-forward-open-sexp end) (not (when (funcall hl-indent-scope-show-block-fn level) (setq found t) t))))) (t (setq found (hl-indent-scope--search-forward-open-sexp end)))) (unless found (goto-char pos-init)) found))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've noticed in certain situations (setting a header is one that comes to mind), we use :eval rather than eval.
 Here's an example:
  (setq-local header-line-format `(:eval (funcall #'message "hi"))) 
 When I try running the same line but with eval instead of :eval, it appears that the header is not set properly (it becomes an empty line rather than “hi”).
 But as far as I can tell, :eval is not its own separate function: when I try to call describe-function on it, I get "no match" unless I remove the colon (":").
 So my question is, what is the purpose of the colon here? Why is it necessary, and where else should/could it be used?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 As my previous post stated, I am in the process of learning Haskell (mainly from learnyouahaskell.com at the moment).
 I've played around with folds a little in the past when learning Scala, and the learnyouahaskell site is currently introducing them.
 One example it gives is an implementation of the elem function (omitting type declaration):
  elem' y ys = foldl (\acc x -> if x == y then True else acc) False ys 
 I have implemented it as a pattern matching function (whether from a previous example on the site or just to try it I can't remember):
  elem' _ [] = False elem' e (x:xs) | e == x = True | otherwise = e `elem'` xs 
 I can understand the foldl version no problem, but my question is regarding performance on large lists. Is the foldl version a worse performer if there exists a matching element early in a long list?
 Would it run forever on an infinite list?
 The pattern matching version obviously terminates as soon as it hits a matching element. But the foldl version appears to just "note" that there exists an element, but continue checking the rest of the list anyway.
 I understand this is just an example to understand how folds work, and behind the scenes is probably not how the elem function is implemented. I just want to make sure my understanding is correct regarding this fold example. That is, that there is no way to terminate the fold process early.
 Thanks!

 Open-source SimpleX Chat – developed in Haskell! - now supports multiple chat profiles – and your traffic will be isolated from other chat profiles in the app.
 Also in v4.5/4.5.1:
  
unsent message draft.
 filenames based on UTC time, to prevent leaking timezone.
 reduced battery usage.
 fixed WebRTC calls for users with blocked UDP.
 fixed some important bugs and one medium severity vulnerability (it had no impact on message or connections security though) - we will publish the disclosure in 2 weeks, together with our bug bounty programme announcement.
 Italian interface, thanks to the users' community and Weblate – with 5 more languages in progress (Chinese, Dutch, Japanese, Czech and Hindi)!
  
See more details in this post and download the apps via the links here.
 We need your help!
 We are looking for a Haskell developer who is more competent in network stack and memory management than we are to help us improve the stability of the platform. Please get in touch if you are interested in a short-term contract.
 Some common SimpleX Chat questions:
 Why user IDs are bad for privacy?
 How SimpleX delivers messages without user profile IDs?
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like to have to have a rather minimal mode line per buffer instead of seeing the same (global) information repeated again in each mode line. For example, I don't want to see the task I have clocked in or the song that is playing right now on every's buffer mode line.
 What is your approach to that?
 Currently, I have (setq mode-line-misc-info nil) to avoid the global-mode-string in the mode line and this helps already a lot. 
 Now, where to put the global-mode-string information instead? I've found the minibuffer-line-mode package and this displays my global-mode-string in the minibuffer area, which is great in 95% of the time. However, sometimes there is important information displayed in the minibuffer that is too fast overridden by minibuffer-line-mode. The cases are rare enough, that I don't have an example right now. But when it happens, it's super annoying.
 So using the minibuffer is maybe not the best option here. So I'm wondering if it's possible to display global-mode-string right-aligned in the menu bar? At least I have it activated and the text in my global-mode-string would fit here (length).
 Is that somehow possible? Couldn't find anything into this direction...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really like Emacs. It's powerful and has so many packages it feels like it can do just about anything.
 My use case is that it's mainly my text editor for anything that it isn't worth opening my IDE for. The problem is, this means I'm not using it every day and therefore I'm not really getting past that early pain while you learn shortcuts/commands. It's almost like I'm starting from scratch every time I use it. Every simple action requires looking through a cheat sheet or doing a web search.
 I know that Emacs isn't supposed to be used in a mainly mouse driven way and many will say that half the point is all the powerful shortcuts that will, eventually, improve productivity. I'm just never getting past the early pain and I'd like something with more menus and more mouse driven support, but still all the features and extensibility of Emacs.
 I'm not looking to switch from my IDE for the heavier stuff, although that would probably help me get over the learning pain, but I've already done that with the IDE and don't want to give that up.
 I did see mousemacs and I really hoped it would be the solution I was looking for, but it seems a little buggy and actually makes things more complicated to use - not less.
 Can anyone suggest either an Emacs alike that fits my needs or a simple way to setup Emacs in this way?
 Edit: Specifically, what I want to be able to do is much of the every day stuff via menus. Either context menus or menu bar menus. I want to be able to list buffers and switch/remove to them. I want to be able to access the customisation via a menu - especially themes and packages. Also - ideally package specific commands as well as being able to assign various commands to a custom menu.

 Anyone have a system that can be setup fresh today?
 Thanks. (If I need to use apple cal or something else I’ll switch, but google is obviously most convenient).

 For example, given the tree:
  │1│ ┌────┴─┴────┐ │ │ │ │ ┌▼┐ ┌▼┐ │2└─────┐ │4│ │ │ ┌▼┐ │3│ 
 Reparenting it on node 3 would produce the following tree:
  ┌─┐ │3│ │ │ ▼ │2│ ┌────┴─┴────┐ │ │ │ │ ┌▼┐ ┌▼┐ │1│ │4│ 
 This looks like a job for a Zipper. However, I also think this can be done with a Lens, although I'm just getting started with Lenses, and not entirely sure. I'll probably end up implementing both approaches for kicks. but I'd like to hear from Haskell veterans that, given this problem, which of the two would be your choice, and why.

 As I understand lisp the quote caused the helpful-mode-map to be sent to evil-define-key unevaluated, so why would it result in its application to all the windows?
 Is it because of the way evil-define-key is defined, or is it some general feature of Emacs Lisp?

 I'm a 2 year old typescript web developer. I'm a bit tired of web development and typescript, and I'm willing to learn something different. I could use your expertise about scala, more precisely to know if it is suited for my needs : 
 1/ I'm willing to learn a functional programming language. I tried recently purescript (haskell like), it made me afraid of purely functional programming, so I though "why not start with something less rigid ?". 
 2/ I would like to make native application (specifically CLI tools), and it has a scala-native compiler. 
 3/ I also would like to make GUI apps. Is it doable with scala ? Does using JavaFX and ScalaFX prevent compiling with scala-native, and make my app require the JVM to run ? 
 Also, would you consider setting up a reliable development environment for scala simple or complicated ? For example, I consider typescript development environment a bit too patchworky to set up. 
 Thank you for any clue you can give me and thank you for reading ;)

 It's been some time that I have been trying to figure how to work out configuring an exchange outlook account for notmuch with Oauth2 / multifactor verification, since basic authentication is now deprecated by microsoft.
 In my UNI there is a 2FA/Oauth2 authentication for Outlook. I am definitely by no means expert on this, however, I have tried all sorts of different setups (using a setup for offlineimap with oauth2 authentication, a mutt token generation script, among others).
 Unfortunately, my university does not give permission for other registering additional clients (and apps in general) therefore I can not use azure for registering new applications therefore I can not use thunderbird's client_id and secret for generating a token. Long story short, I can not use my favourite editor for composing/sending email for outlook.
  
I have IMAP enabled, but is not possible to register application
  
Is there any way to configure outlook with 2FA/oauth2 :
  
without having to bypass my university's regulations
 any other solution at least for
  
 Composing email within emacs and somehow telling outlook application to send it ? (osascript?)
 Fetching new email and exporting to maildir therefore I can create a notmuch-friendly database?

 This release introduces kele-list, bound to s-k <resource type> l. In previous versions of Kele, you could only fetch single resources; there was no way to view groups of resources at a time. Now, with kele-list, you can create ad-hoc “overviews” of specific resource types within a given context and namespace; hitting Enter on any entry in this list brings up the resource’s full manifest.
 Here's a screenshot
 For more details, see: How-Tos > Usage. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you'd like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.

 Let's say you have a list of lists of Doubles [[Double]].
 [[-0.5,-0.5,4.5,4.5],[1.5,-1.0,6.5,9.0],[1.0,2.0,5.0,6.0]] 
 How would you go about iterating (map) over each one, and making a new list with the elements at index 0. Then doing a new list with elements at index 1, then at index 2 and finally at index 3.So essentially the first list will have all the elements at index 0, second list at index 1, etc.
 Result would be:
 [[-0.5,1.5,1.0],[-0.5,-1.0,2.0],[4.5,6.5,5.0],[4.5,9.0,6.0]] 
 Or it could also just be function that takes [[Double]] as first parameter and the index as second parameter and then returns a single list.
 createList :: [[Double]] -> Int -> [Double] createList list index = map function list index function :: [Double] -> Int -> Double function list index = list !! index 
 Something like that.
 Then I could do something like:
 let list = [[-0.5,-0.5,4.5,4.5],[1.5,-1.0,6.5,9.0],[1.0,2.0,5.0,6.0]] let listAtIndexZero = createList list 0 let listAtIndexOne = createList list 1 let listAtIndexTwo = createList list 2 let listAtIndexThree = createList list 3 
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got Emacs 28.2 (self-compiled, 739b5d0e52) on one host of mine.
 Whenever I do invoke M-w (for kill-ring-save) of a region that has - I guess - non 7 bit US ASCII characters included, I get "Non-ASCII string must be encoded in advance" followed by the region text with re-coded characters in the minibuffer. As a matter of fact, the message appears even before that when the region gets expanded to the first non-ASCII character and the later kill-ring-save is failing when kill-new is invoked within its definition.
 Good case: I mark a region like "foo bar" and am able to push it into the clipboard by invoking M-w as usual. Perfect. No issue with marking the region or pushing to the clipboard.
 Error case: However, when I try to create a region with "foo€" or "fooä" or "fooß" or "foo¼" I get the weird behavior described above as soon as the first non-ASCII character gets added to the region and the clipboard doesn't get any new content pushed to when I do try to kill.
 I'm not sure if this is related: when the region gets defined by pressing C-SPC and then expanded by right-char I also get "Replaced 0 occurrences" with every new invocation. This is suspicious as well. Maybe they both are related? 
 With emacs -q, there is always normal behavior (good case) without the error message. So it has to be related to my configuration.
 The same configuration using Emacs 27.1 also does not have this weird behavior. 
 How can I debug this? Does this sound familiar to you? Do you have an idea what that might cause? 
 My config is rather hard to impossible to bi-sect with a sane effort. :-(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately, I have been thinking of playing with desktop GUI in Scala (I know that "desktop is dead", but I am not a fan of Electron and have always been fond of reading about native GUI, so I want to try it out). There are already tools like Skija and JWM which provide a good starting point, but I miss an important feature that a GUI framework should have: the ability to hot reload code, so changes can be seen on the screen quickly.
 I have come across three alternatives so far:
  
Going with a markup language: I could create my own XML-like language or use a template engine to parse the UI and generate components. This approach is used by Gtk, WPF, JavaFX, Avalonia, and others. While this solution is good for simple projects, it becomes annoying for more complex UIs that need to be dynamic. It also seems burdensome to connect all events and signals.
 
Embedding an interpreted language, like Graal-js and interoperating with Scala for non-UI code. The downside of this approach is that most of the code would likely be written in JavaScript, kind of defeating the purpose of having a Scala GUI.
 
Joining forces with other projects like HumbleUI, which already achieves this goal, and bridging them to Scala. The downside again is that HumbleUI is written in Clojure, not Scala. I like the idea of contributing to the success of other projects, but I am not sure if most people will want to deal with a Lisp.
 
 I am wondering how I can achieve this feature. Is a Scalajs-Graaljs-Scala combo worth the complexity? Should I go with a templating engine? Would it be possible to do some Scala hot reloading of the view with Ammonite, and if so, how? Are there any other ways I am missing? I have been asking myself these questions for some time now, but I cannot find the answers on my own.
 Maybe I am spoiled by web development, and hot reloading is not that necessary. What would you like to see in a modern GUI framework to make desktop apps that can compete with Electron ones?

 Kill current word. In the line void foo(int a, |int b) { /*do stuff*/); the cursor is right before the second int declaration. Can I kill this word without having to use Ctrl-3-d?
 Select and modify all identical words on the same line, i.e. in the line void bar(double a, double b, double c, double d) I found out it would be better if each argument was an int. Can I for example select the first instance of double somehow, then as I retype it to int, all other instances are also changed? I think I've seen tsoding do this, so it's probably just a matter of installing a package. 
 Any input on how to efficiently selecting large blocks of code fast would also be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created this issue a few months ago: https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/8270
 I also made a reddit thread about this same topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskellquestions/comments/vi0tcm/how_to_redirect_cabal_haddock_output_to_a/
 I would like to be able to redirect cabal haddock output to a folder of my choice. In issue comments it was suggested to add an --only-documentation flag to cabal install.
 I've been trying to implement this change and realised that I don't actually know what would be the most desirable behavior for this command.
 Should it only copy documentation that's already been generated? Or should it generate documentation? If it generates documentation, then should it be also able to re-run haddock and overwrite the existing documentation even if documentation already exists?
 If it's able to run haddock (and not just copy documentation) then should it put the documentation in the standard folder first and then make a copy? Or redirect the documentation where the user wants it and create just this one copy?
 Is adding this option to cabal install the most reasonable way to do this? Are there other, maybe better ways of achieving the same end? Wouldn't it be better to add some kind of additional flag / argument to cabal haddock?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have this issue with org publish and I can't solve it...
 I want to make a different postamble for different parts of my project (the same problem applies for the head variables).
 I define two different postamble as this:
 (setq pages-html-postamble "<footer>My postamble 1</footer>" blog-html-postamble "<footer>My postamble 2</footer>") 
 And then I reference them in different components of the org-publish-project-alist variable like this:
 (setq org-publish-project-alist `(("pages" :html-head ,pages-html-head :html-postamble ,pages-html-postamble ;; ... :recursive t) ("blog" :html-head ,blog-html-head :html-postamble ,blog-html-postamble ;; ... ("blog-images" :base-directory "blog/" :base-extension "jpg\\|gif\\|png" :publishing-directory "docs/blog" :publishing-function org-publish-attachment :recursive t) ("assets" :base-directory "assets/" :base-extension "css\\|ttf\\|ico\\|png" :publishing-directory "docs/assets/" :publishing-function org-publish-attachment :recursive t) ("all" :components ("blog" "pages" "blog-images" "assets")))) 
 ​
 Then if I publish from command line using emacs --batch --load publish.el --funcall org-publish-all I cannot get the result that I expect of two different postambles but only the pages postamble is used. Is there anything I am missing? I tried with org-html-postamble-format but I encounter the same issue.
 Org version is 9.6 and Emacs version is GNU Emacs 29.0.60 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, X toolkit, cairo version 1.17.6, Xaw scroll bars) of 2023-01-10.
 Any help is appreciated, thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm rather new to Emacs and have been trying to move all my coding setup to Emacs. I started setting up with Doom Emacs, but its buffer management wasn't exactly what I wanted. (Otherwise Doom Emacs has been a great starter for my use cases, though.)
 ​
 What I am hoping to get is the following
  
Each project has dedicated buffer list
 I can easily navigate between projects
 I can always see the current project + list of projects
 I can close and recover project at any time (or hide project)
 I can see the file tree of the current project (probably with Treemacs)
 (Bonus) I want to dedicate some "perspective" or "tab" for programs such as Org Agenda, Elfeed, etc.
  
​
 I am currently trying with perspective rather than persp-mode, as it segregates the buffer list as I like (#1 above). I've got projectile with persp-projectile, and that seems to give me what I need for project navigation (#2 probably, still not 100%). I get some help in my mode line for project focus (#3, partially).
 But I'm rethinking about my approach, as tab-bar-mode would give me nice visual help (#3), and it seems difficult to recover a perspective using perspective, and persp-mode may be a better fit in that sense (#4). The Treemacs integration isn't working for me either, and I get the same list of file trees for all perspectives -- I'm pretty sure I'm doing something stupid, but this was handled nicely with Doom Emacs's workspace support (#5). But perspective seems to work best for segregated buffer list (#1).
 ​
 I would probably have to tweak and customise more to get my setup exactly to my likings, but I'd appreciate if experts here can shed some light into how they manage multiple projects!

However there appear to be some issues with it. I am not at all familiar with how exactly emacs runs under the hood, and have pretty much used it only as a basic editor before, due to this I have no idea what exactly the issue is, but when I open the configuration page for the elpy module I see these warning (below). What is the issue exactly here, did I mess something up when installing the package (I just used the list-packages and installed it from there):

And we can also use the deferred.el library to write asynchrous code, but it's just trying to pass other actions to run another process asynchrous, while still on the same thread. It's still not possible to run things parallel on same Emacs process, which makes harder to run multiple tasks on Emacs, or with EXWM and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This comment got me thinking more generally about the capability to see what impending updates will do to my emacs installation or what a recent update brought in.
 From what I can find, paradox has a limited capability to do this, but paradox was recently closed down/abandoned.
 It seems like users of quelpa or straight may have an easier time given that packages are pulled in natively from their respective source repositories, but installing a package from a repository like melpa may be harder since the package isn't tied into a repository commit or revision - you may have to see if the package ships with something like a NEWS file, scrape the package description for a source URL (which the aforementioned reddit comment does) and clone it to view raw commits, or something else.
 I would really like to have this capability but wanted to check to see if I may be missing something before trying my hand at some novice elisp to try and solve the problem in a very general way.

2.6d Create Zettels
In this step of the Zettelkasten process, we take our Literature Notes full of contextualized ideas and add them to our Slipbox as de-contextualized ideas. (see [[2.6.1 The Zettelkasten Process]])
Purpose
We create zettels to confirm our applied comprehension of an idea and to re-contextualize it against other ideas found in new sources. (see [[2.6d1 Creating Zettels Improves Applied Comprehension]])
Creating Zettels
Create Zettels  --  Decontextualize Ideas


Open Literature Notes taken from Capture Ideas (see [[2.6c Capture Notes]]) on second monitor.
Read through Literature Notes and Zettels.


What does this note mean for my own research & questions within my slipbox? Why did these notes capture my interest? 1
What ideas would help me continue a discussion in an existing Zettel?

Create a new Zettel to capture that idea. ([[2.3a Conditions for Strong Zettel]], [[2.3a1 Obsidian Zettel Template]])

Review Zettel


Does my title actually summarize EVERYTHING in this Zettel?  If not, it's 2+ ideas.  Split it up.  ([[2.3a2 Zettel Titles]])

Link Zettels -- Recontextualize Ideas


Make it easy to RETRIEVE. (see [[2.6d2 Make Zettel Linking Easier By Considering Your Desired Contexts]])
Use my Five L's to link Zettels together. (see [[2.5a The Five L's to Connecting Zettels]])

Zettel Creation Tips
When developing a topic in your Zettelkasten, a new zettel should be in direct response to an existing Zettel 2 (see [[2.6e Develop Topics]]).  This ensures we're focusing into fewer topics (and thus making more progress), rather than scattering our focus across many topics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In "How to Take Smart Notes", Ahrens states that before you add a slip to your slipbox, you should:
"Make sure it can be found from the index; add an entry in the index if necessary or refer to it from a note that is connected to the index." (p. 104)
Originally, I thought it was just important that no slip gets orphaned and is connected to some thread of notes, but this statement gives me the impression that every slip must be no more than 1 degree of separation away from the Index. But once your slipbox grows a significant amount, this will cause your index to get cluttered, which runs counter to what he says later:
"[Keywords in the index] should be chosen carefully and sparsely. Luhmann would add the number of one or two (rarely more) notes next to a keyword in the index." (p. 106)
How do you interpret this for Zettelkasten? Is it crucial that there's no more than 1 degree of separation from your index? Or is it just important that it's eventually connected (e.g. with potentially 2, 5, 10, or more notes between the Index and the new slip)?]]></summary>

 I have a question for all the Meow users. Basically, how did you get used to its unique selection behavior?
 I am a former evil user, who recently switched to god-mode. In customizing my own god-mode setup, I am finding that I am basically trying to recreate several aspects of Meow. The one stumbling block I find is the auto-selection since it is so different from vim's visual-modes or Emacs' mark behavior. 
 Alternatively, has anyone been able to recreate the Beacon state without meow or modified meow to have a more traditional selection.
 Lastly, if you don't know what Meow is please check it out. Even if it is not for me, I think it is a super cool project that I want to succeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been modifying my modeline. I have an :eval-based construct to show whether the current buffer is modified using the colour of an "M":
 (:eval (let ((mod (buffer-modified-p))) (propertize "M" 'face (if mod 'my/modified 'my/unmodified) 'mouse-face 'mode-line-highlight 'keymap `(mode-line keymap ,my/modeline-modified-map) 'help-echo (format "Buffer is %smodified. \\{my/modeline-modified-map}" (if mod "" "un"))))) 
 The faces are red for modified and grey for unmodified. This works in that it displays a red "M" when the buffer is modified, and a grey one when it isn't. But if I switch to another window, away from a modified buffer, the M stays red. The text of simpler string constructs (e.g. "%b") in my modeline goes a lighter grey in the no-longer-active buffer. How can I make the M do this too? (Ideally, with a darker red, rather than straight grey-ing out.)

 So what should I do. Which typeclass do you always derive ?

 So I'm on debian 11 using doom emacs and I want to use jedi as my python language server.
 I use pip to install it, which puts the binary in $HOME/.local/bin.
 I add a line to my .bashrc file and sure enough /home/*myName*/.local/bin/jedi-language-server shows up when I run which.
 But when I opened a .py file in emacs, I would get an error message about the language server not being installed, and a message in the *lsp-log* buffer saying that jedi-language-server was not found in path.
 I fixed it by adding this line to config.el:
 (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/home/*myName*/.local/bin")))
 So, I guess my question is, why did I need to add that line?
 Where does (doom) emacs get its default path variable from and why does it not just copy the users path?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am customizing AHK-mode to meet my needs. Because that mode derives from prog-mode, I understand it inherits prog-mode's syntax table. The problem is that there are often an odd number of unquoted quotation marks (") in a single line in my AutoHotkey code, which causes emacs to interpret large swaths of multi-line text as one single string.
 How I can I modify the syntax table for ahk-mode to force emacs to believe a string ends at a newline character? I made a couple changes to at least prevent the fontification of multi-line strings (I changed the variable ahk-double-quote-string-re to "\".*?\"", and I followed this advice when defining font-lock-defaults), but emacs still believes the multi-line strings are there, which messes with other things like imenu and hl-prog-extra.
 Any help would be much appreciated!

 Basically:

 Update. ensure-list (for emacs 28.1+) does just this. The manual even lists this as an explicit example:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on an exercise to build a simple parser for the Forth language). The grammar and data types I came up with are given below.
 Grammar
 Int = @{ ASCII_DIGIT+ } Add = { "+" } Sub = { "-" } Mul = { "*" } Div = { "/" } BinOp = { Add | Sub | Mul | Div } Dup = { ^"DUP" } Drop = { ^"DROP" } Swap = { ^"SWAP" } Over = { ^"OVER" } StackOp = { Dup | Drop | Swap | Over } Rhs = _{ Int ~ BinOp } BinExpr = _{ Int ~ Rhs } CompoundExpr = _{ BinExpr ~ Rhs } BuiltInCmd = { Int | BinOp | StackOp | CompoundExpr } COLON = _{ ":" } SEMICOLON = _{ ";" } WHITESPACE = _{ " " } HyphenatedWord = _{ ASCII_ALPHA+ ~ Sub ~ ASCII_ALPHA+ } Word = @{ HyphenatedWord | BinOp | ASCII_ALPHA+ } Cmd = { Word | BuiltInCmd } Defn = { Cmd+ } WordDefn = { COLON ~ Word ~ Defn ~ SEMICOLON } InvalidWord = { COLON ~ ANY* } LineItem = { WordDefn | Cmd | InvalidWord } Line = _{ SOI ~ LineItem+ ~ EOI } 
 Types
 newtype Line = Line [LineItem] data LineItem = WordDefn Word [Cmd] | Cmd | InvalidWord Text data Cmd = Word | BuiltInCmd data Word = Word1 Text | BinOp data BuiltInCmd = Int1 Int | BinOp1 BinOp | StackOp | CompoundExpr Int [Rhs] newtype Int = Int Int data Rhs = Rhs Int BinOp data StackOp = Dup | Drop | Swap | Over data BinOp = Add | Sub | Mul | Div 
 Now, BuiltInCmd is either an Int, or a BinOp, etc. The problem is, I get compilation errors like "Multiple declarations of ‘BinOp’", so, I'm forced to create a wrapper BinOp1. But surprisingly, Word is defined similarly and doesn't have a problem. What am I doing wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working with this TypeScript source code, which is large, and I'm really missing some features offered by a tool called Go Guru for the Go programming language. Go Guru has the following commands, that work after you correctly set its scope:
 callees show possible targets of selected function call callers show possible callers of selected function callstack show path from callgraph root to selected function definition show declaration of selected identifier describe describe selected syntax: definition, methods, etc freevars show free variables of selection implements show 'implements' relation for selected type or method peers show send/receive corresponding to selected channel op pointsto show variables the selected pointer may point to referrers show all refs to thing denoted by selected identifier what show basic information about the selected syntax node whicherrs show possible values of the selected error variable 
 So, in Go I use callers to figure what functions are calling the function at-point (where currently the cursor is in Emacs) and try to follow the flow of execution from there. I don't recall if go-guru Emacs package has support for callstack command, but that's what I do.
 for TypeScript, I don't know any tool that would allow me to do something like this. At most, I perform a project-wide search for the name of the function I'm interested, but this is too cumbersome if I want to investigate the flow of execution.

 Threads are often created in rooms where I'm subscribed. I'd like to be able to unsubscribe from threads that I've determined aren't relevant to me, so that I stop receiving tracking notifications about new messages sent to those threads. My best guess about how to do that, after browsing the not-fully-documented emacs-slack code, was to call the slack-message-unfollow command while visiting the thread buffer I wanted to unsubscribe from. However, it doesn't work; I keep getting notifications about new messages in that thread afterwards.
 Is it possible to stop getting notifications about particular threads? If so, how?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I'm wonder if I'm doing something wrong or misunderstand but I'm currently facing some issues on my NixOS system.I'd like to use something like direnv to load flakes. My setup below works great when just launching emacs, but when using emacsclient, it seems to not be working, even though I'm not really receiving any errors from the envrc buffer. It loads the .envrc, build the flake input and export. It just looks like the path does not work afterwards.
 So I've configured Emacs to run as a services using services.emacs.enable = true. For my shell I added programs.zsh.shellInit = ''emulate zsh -c "$(direnv hook zsh)", but I've also tried eval "$(direnv hook zsh)".
 Direnv is installed using the nix-direnv installation instructions under "Via configuration.nix in NixOS".I read some recommendations that envrc.el is a better alternative then direnv.el, and after some testing I have to agree.(envrc-global-mode) is enabled in my config. This works perfectly with a normal emacs instance.
 For some reason it just does not seem to work with the emacsclient.Starting emacs --daemon specifically with a emulated zsh shell does not seems to work.Executing envrc-reload and direnv-update-directory-environment also don't seem to solve it.
 I honestly don't know why this does not work. That's also why I'm posting here and not in a github repo, since I'm not sure where the issue is occurring from. Most of the time I just run normal emacs, but the bigger the config become, the more I'd like to switch to running the daemon.
 Any info is greatly appreciated.

 nng: https://github.com/jimenezrick/nng-haskell
 The original nanomsg-haskell bindings are from Ivar Nymoen and Ben Gamari, thanks to them!
 I think the Haskell ecosystem needs a big push in terms of improving its offering of supported RPC/messaging libraries, hence I wanted to have some basic bindings in a workable state.
 For context, if you are familiar with ZeroMQ, Nanomsg and NNG (its evolution) are equivalent RPC/messaging libraries with some technical differences, but in essence the same concept. These are in my opinion a bit a more lean technologies compared to the more bloated gRPC ecosystem.

 I don't like the default dired behaviour of directories' buffers persisting even after you leave them, so I've set it up to always reuse the same buffer.
 The problem that I have now is that it does it even when just visiting some files and that makes it long and difficult to go back to the place I was before doing that.
 For some context: I have configured my dired-map to move upward and inward using h and l (on the lines of distrotube's config, I'm an evil doom-emacs user).
 For the outward movement I'm using this:
 (kbd "h") '(lambda () (interactive) (find-alternate-file "..")
 Taken from http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/emacs_dired_tips.html 
 For the inward movement I'm using this:
 (kbd "l") 'dired-find-alternate-file
 Which works great when visiting a child directory,…]]></summary>

 For example, if I have somewhere in my multi-file and sprawling config the statement:
 (require 'elisp-settings) 
 then, the next call to (require 'elisp-settings) will catch that this file has already been provided, and skip re-loading that content.
 ​
 However, every time that I call:
 (literate-elisp-load "elisp-settings.org") 
 It will keep loading all that configuration code. Does anyone have a way to only load each literate config file exactly once?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I deal with transmission protocol files that are based on NISO/ANZI standards and do not use line feeds (C-q C-j). Working with big files without line feeds can be slow. The standard specifies records and uses a character to indicate the end of such records. I thought if I could make Emacs interpret that character as a line feed, I could then better work with files.
 I tried using an Emacs display table to replace the ^] with \n but it did not seem to improve performance, even though it did visually change the display of text. So, I assume I need to work at a lower level. Does that seem correct?
 Do I need to create a new coding system to get Emacs to consider that end of record character as a line feed? I had also thought of some kind of hook that replaced ^] with \n upon every read and vice versa with writes. Any other suggestions? I would prefer it be a seamless process for other users because I may write a mode to handle such files. Thanks.

 I searched there from LinkedIn and certainly there are a lot of scala jobs. But when searching with keywords like 'scala visa' or 'scala relocation', only handful of jobs were searched.
 Maybe I approach is wrong, is there other place to search? 
 Or maybe most Scala jobs in those countries are Visa supported but not mentioned on JD, so I should try them also even though they didn't mention about visa or relocation support?
 Or is there other way I need to try?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering if there is a package that can do the few things listed below for braces and parenthesis? I recently had to use Intellij and noticed it had some features by default which I would love to get working in Emacs.
 ​
 Make braces/parens in pairs.
 ​
 When a pair of braces/parens are made, with the cursor in between, hitting enter makes it so the bottom brace goes down two lines and my cursor is in the same position as if I'd hit enter once
 ​
 When on a bottom brace, show the name of the function of statement that is attaches to. An example for this would be if I had a brace for a function that is longer than my screen, when I put my cursor on the bottom brace, something would pop-up (or mini-buffer) saying something like def test() or for etc.
 ​
 Edit:
 So I found electric-pair-mode which solves the first two problems. Anyone know of a package that does the third?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am getting annoyed by automatic formatting rules which I don't know where they come from, every time I press RET on a line with a function declaration. Modes in the buffer:
 Minor modes enabled in this buffer: Auto-Save Company Eldoc Flymake Font-Lock Lsp-Completion Lsp-Diagnostics Lsp-Headerline-Breadcrumb Lsp-Managed Lsp Lsp-Modeline-Diagnostics Lsp-Modeline-Workspace-Status Whitespace Word-Wrap-Whitespace The major mode is C++//l mode defined in cc-mode.el: 
 Example:
 void test()<cursor, pressing RET> // gets formatted into void test() // 4 spaces added // removed 4 spaces added previously, // added one curly brace, and hit RET: void test() {<pressing RET> // gets formatted into void test() { // curly brace moved up one line // 2 spaces added 
 In my .emacs however, I have explictely set:
 (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook (lambda () (setq c-syntactic-indentation nil) (setq indent-tabs-mode t) (setq tab-width 4))) 
 Asking for help with C-h k <RET> gives me:
 RET (translated from <return>) runs the command newline (found in global-map), which is an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’. It is bound to RET. (newline &optional ARG INTERACTIVE) Insert a newline, and move to left margin of the new line. With prefix argument ARG, insert that many newlines. If ‘electric-indent-mode’ is enabled, this indents the final new line that it adds, and reindents the preceding line. To just insert a newline, use M-x electric-indent-just-newline. 
 However, toggling electric-indent-mode or just calling M-x electric-indent-just-newline makes zero difference in behavior.
 TLDR: I don't want emacs to try to be smart about formatting, I can't detect what particular mode / variable needs to be changed in order to just insert newline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I’m familiar with the use of C/++ and Rust using various architectures, though most of my (home lab) boards are in the STM32 family, so a resource that uses them as a reference point would be ideal for starting quickly.
 This would basically be my first major foray into Haskell beyond the LYAHFGG book, and, thus, my first time trying to get as close to purely functional as possible in the embedded space. 
 My current startup strategy is pretty meh in my opinion, which was to just use the generated assembly from a *.hs and link it together with some other tooling, but that somewhat goes against the spirit of what I’d like to do, which is to approach “provable embedded software”. 
 If there are any good books or text based tutorials out there that you can recommend it would be much appreciated.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple weeks ago I posted a little bit of code for getting Emacs 29 to automatically switch between major modes and their tree-sitter enhanced versions, and I couldn't be more thrilled with the response it got. Since then, I've spent some time refining the package, getting it on MELPA, and adding a couple features that I felt were missing. In particular, I wanted Emacs to install and use a grammar as soon as I visit a file that has a tree-sitter version available. treesit-auto 0.3 introduced the treesit-auto-install variable, which can be nil, t, or 'prompt. I like to set it to 'prompt, in case my internet connection isn't great. This is what it looks like when I visit a Rust file without the grammar. If treesit-auto-install is t, it will skip the prompt and install the grammar right away. 
 Otherwise, when this variable is nil (the default), it will try to fall back to one of the original major modes, such as python-mode, js-mode, or rust-mode. The exact details on how it finds a fallback are documented in the README on GitHub.
 Thank you to all who have contributed so far! It's been a fun project to work on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been going id crazy with links to my daily plan file (ala rainer's udumy course). It's been great, but there is one gnarly bug I need to squash that comes up randomly.
 TL;DR: I need a way to force org to rebuild the db. org-id-update-id locations doesn't get it done. org-element-cache-reset doesn't help.
 Repro: I'm not sure exactly what I do, but several undos and a save of my personal.org file got my follow from agenda to stop working (only some items, old items that used to work). Maybe I moved some orders around. But I'm looking right at a top level headline that i can't org-id-goto, even when I copy paste the id I'm staring right at in.
 ​
 Test: Refiling to another file and then trying the update and goto doesn't fix it. It's like the item is bugged. So here is the item just in case I'm being blind (note, this item was not touched recently and seems random that this wound up bugged... along with many others)
 * Test ** NEXT call xxxx for haircut SCHEDULED: <2023-03-01 Wed> A line with name and number (notes text anytime) :PROPERTIES: :ID: 272A86E5-E711-469C-8059-C7D11A4C8717 :END: :LOGBOOK: - State "DONE" from "WAITING" [2023-01-19 Thu 08:35] \\ haircut yesterday - State "WAITING" from "TODO" [2023-01-16 Mon 14:00] \\ texted - State "TODO" from [2023-01-15 Sun 08:47] :END: 
 Thanks for any and info. I don't use org-roam, and the only mentions of this issue seemed centered on that.
 ​
 EDIT: Another oddity, when trying to jump to the id in another file it would just fail to find it. After a restart I get the option to create the heading in the current file. So it seems to have gone from half broken to full broken.

 This works, but notice that isValid tediously repeats the argument x for all functions on the right. I'm wondering if there's a way to avoid this. I thought of the &&& Arrow operator, but as per my understanding, it'll output a 3-tuple, and I've to combine the values manually.

 for one of my college courses im using haskell, and the lecturer asked us to use quickcheck on a set (list) of functions, problem is, i don't know how i should check the property to the list, and GHC (ver 9.4.4) throws me errors each time i try to compile or change the type signature of the prop function to (Natural -> Natural)
 ​
 this is how the main function should look like according to the proffesor
 main :: IO () main = quickCheck $ prop_fac [fac1, fac2, fac3, fac4, fac5] 
 btw, for anyone interested, the quickcheck is for verifying all functions in the list are valid implementations of the factorial

 Often when working on a project there are a number of different org headings that are relevant. These headings are spread across files, and may even be children of each other.
 What I’d like is the ability to add headings to a group (possibly named) and then be able to either switch between them (like ido-switch-buffer) or open up all of them at once (in indirect buffers), or search within just those headings.
 You could go through and tag all of the headings, but this seems cumbersome, and it feels wrong to modify the heading rather than just pointing to it.
 All of my headings have ids, so I’m not worried about ambiguous references.
 I’ve seen packages that work in similar ways for collections of files, or buffers. But I haven’t seen one whose object is a heading.
 Do you know of a package that already exists like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, let me just say that I had written a huge text explaining what I was trying to do, but realized it was too much text and nobody has time for that. So I'll resume it as:
 I have this constructor:
 data Fruit = Apple {quantity :: Int, price :: Double} | Banana {quantity :: Int, price :: Double} | Grapes {quantity :: Int, price :: Double} 
 I have this list of lists:
 [["apple", "2", "1.50"], ["banana", "5", "2.15"], ["grapes", "4", "1.00"]] 
 I'm trying to build a function that iterates through the list of lists and that leverages the constructor above to access the second and third item in order to compute a total:
 total :: [[String]] -> [[Double]] 
 The result would be a list of lists of doubles:
 [[3.00], [10.75], [4.00]] 
 Questions
 Is something like this below valid or am I going in the wrong direction and should use instead some list comprehension or the map function, etc ?
 Notes:
  
qty = quantity
 p = price
 I assume I'll have to convert my list of lists to match the constructor types, or change my constructor to all String, and then convert right before computing numbers.
  
What I want it to do:
  
Grab first list.
 If "apple" is in the first list, then use getters to access the quantity and price.
 Call some function to compute the two numbers and add the result to first list of lists.
 Recursive call on the rest, which should be the next to lists with banana and grapes
  
​
 total :: [[String]] -> [[Double]] total (x : xs) | "apple" 'elem' x = computeFunction(qty, p) : total(xs) | "banana" 'elem' x = computeFunction(qty, p) : total(xs) | "grapes" 'elem' x = computeFunction(qty, p) : total(xs) 
 Something like this behavior --> [3.00] : [10.75] : [4.00] : []

That was the first step in improving the user experience and paved the way for many future enhancements.
Today we are announcing another update to the API, a new project name, jupyenv, and new features on the site.
You can now find the new site at jupyenv.io.
Why the name change?
We want to reach a bigger audience.
If you are a regular Nix user, jupyterWith is a good name.
It is analogous to the python.withPackages function in nixpkgs.
But outside of the Nix ecosystem, the with naming scheme is non-existent.
To better target people outside the Nix ecosystem, we are changing the name that emphasizes Jupyter environments (hence jupyenv).

 I am stuck at a crossing road between Emacs, ERT, Geiser, SRFI 64 and Guile ! Too much for my current knowledge.
 I would like to evaluate a temporary buffer with Geiser. The said buffer is filled with a Guile script that should write to a file how many tests have been run with a SRFI 64 test suite.
 All of this is part of an ERT test that finally reads from the written file a number to compare to the expected.
 Unfortunately, my script does not seems to write anything to a file.
 If my explanations are not that clear, here is the script I am working on :
 https://framagit.org/Jeko/emacs-srfi64/-/raw/master/srfi64-test.el
 And here is the command line I use to run the ERT test :
 emacs -batch -l ert -l srfi64-test.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit 
 Thank you for anything you could bring to my attention !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My goal is to be able to move up and down the treemacs buffer and select files without needing to actually select the treemacs buffer. I would like to bind M-J, M-K, M-RET to treemacs-previous-line, treemacs-next-line, and treemacs-RET-action respectively, but it does not work. If you run any of those commands while not inside the treemacs buffer, they do nothing. As soon as I place my cursor in the treemacs buffer, they work fine.
 Anybody have any advice on how to get this simple functionality?

 I started using god-mode and I'd like to be able to tell if it's on or not. However, I don't want to use the fringe for that (it's just too far down my screen)
 I was thinking about flipping the colour of the cursor but it doesn't seem to be possible without some ugly hacks. Also, I was thinking about flipping the theme itself but I think it's a bit too extreme
 For now I just switch cursor type to bar (from default box) but that's too subtle
 Any other suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title of the question may not do the justice for what I am seeking so I will try to describe my intent.
 I am already familiar with core functional programming concepts (ADT, pattern matching, lists, error handling, types, etc.) and I have been playing with Haskell for last few weeks and I am now comfortable with syntax and overall ecosystem.
 Now, I want to embark on the journey of solidifying my understanding of Haskell and theory behind it - basically trying to understand why things are the way they are. I understand that this puts me in mathematical domain (I did some intermediate maths in my higher college but mostly centered around physics - calculus, linear algebra, etc.).
 After endlessly trying to search for right starting point, I found myself stuck in Discrete Mathematics, Lambda Calculus, Set Theory, Category Theory and Abstract Algebra. I am vaguely familiar with these branches but absolutely have no clue how they or which one connects the dots with Haskell. I saw some introductory category theory video but it is just too abstract to understand at this stage.
 To reiterate, the goal is to get better understanding of Haskell concepts from more theoretical perspective and build a better mental model. The literature is literally countless. Where should I begin assuming good programming background but very little mathematical background?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched from Helm to Vertico+Consult+Marginalia, and so far I love almost everything about it. The one thing I really miss is having things set up so that when I execute a command that asks for a file, the completion defaults to a file at point.
 I know I can use M-n or PgDn to get to the next item in future history, which may be the eligible thing at point. But I orchestrate a lot of my work from an org file which has bare filenames in it, and it's handy to be able to do C-x C-f RET and open one of these files. Or C-x g (magit-status) RET and go straight to a git repository listed in the file.
 That said, I always had a little trouble when I tried one of these commands and point was on something I didn't want suggested, and I could never remember how to get back to whatever things would be like if it weren't. So maybe I should just deal with this. But more often than not, immediately suggesting the thing at point is what I want.
 I also tried Embark, and it immediately gave me errors, so I turned it off. Plus, I think I'd like to keep doing this in an action-suggest-enter mode rather than what Embark allows.
 Any suggestions for how to do what I want efficiently?

 My wife is preparing to open her medical practice in the next year. We've discussed that it would be nice to have a website where patients can book apppointments, receive reminder e-mails, read her medical notes, etc. I think it would be fun to do it myself.
 In the past, I've played around with Yesod to build simple prototypes, mostly for learning how to build web applications. However, back then, my biggest hurdle was deployment; I didn't know how to deploy and maintain a web application.
 My question is: what platform do you recommend I use to deploy a Haskell-based web application and a small database? I've taken a look at Heroku, and I've estimated the cost at about ~75$/mo. 
 Should I instead learn Nix and rent a dedicated server?

 I would like to learn how to parse JSON in Haskell with the aeson library. 
 I have the following JSON: 
  { "parameters": [ { "name": "restart", "type": "enum<string>", "required": false, "values": { "enumValues": [ "month", "year" ] }, "description": "The restart period.", "notes": [ "Note.", "Note 2." ] }, { "name": "operations", "type": "uinteger", "required": true, "values": { "min": 10, "max": 800 }, "description": "Short description." } ]} 
 You can see that it's a bit weird, but it's close to a JSON I was working with at work.
 I wrote the following code to parse the JSON:

Is that a error of native compiled Emacs?, there is not much information on web about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s anything all the discourse and posturing of the last week has made abundantly clear: the Scala community needs an S-tier IDE.
 I am proud to announce a community initiative to achieve this goal. I am hoping this thread be a transparent forum for us to set the agenda going forward, and offer some suggestions to get the discussion going:
 - Let’s not re-invent the wheel. I propose we start with Ensime:TNG. This project is the seminal work of one of the most respected men in our community. The obvious alternative would be Metals, but let’s be real: Metals has made their bed with Scala Center, and Scala Center has proven to value Political Correctness over Commercial Success.
 - Minimize Distractions and Getting Stuff Done. I propose after this thread conclude we band together under a private github organization. This will prevent bad-faith actors from sabotaging our work, and it will protect you from being canceled for being a collaborator. I have already squatted some github orgs and domain names that could be used. Since I am the owner of these I will obviously benevolently administrate them.
 - Market the IDE. I’ve offered enough suggestions and I HATE marketing. Maybe others have an idea about how we do this. Perhaps a conference CFP? Does anyone know of any conferences happening later this year that will soon be accepting proposals?
 Looking forward to a fearless future with a grade “A” Scala IDE, long live Scala!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I'm super new to haskell and I just can't seem to get this working at all. The code is supposed to create a multiplication table from the users input.
 main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "What number for multable?" input <- getLine let num = (read input:: Int) multable num multable :: Int -> IO () multable = do map inc[1..x] [1..x] inc :: [Int] -> Int -> IO () inc list i = do print (foldl (*) i list) 
 I think the problem is with the inc function where it needs bot list and integer input but I'm still completely baffled by haskell syntax..
 Help and feedback would be appreciated!

 I have two questions. 
 (1) Are these features available within Emacs?
  
Bi-directional linking between pages and blocks (paragraphs), feature that is present in Roam, RemNote and Logseq
 Graph representation of all the connections between pages (concepts)
  
(2) Judging by my needs, is it worth it for me to devote my time to learning Emacs? How is "bad" the learning curve?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I mentioned that it would be nice to have some large example org files for testing, and to satisfy people that modern org deals very well with large files. I created such a file based on XML versions of all of Shakespeare's plays. It has about 33k headings, 150k lines, and a million words. I included the simple python parser in case people would like to play. The file itself consists mostly of nested headings with some styling. It might be good to add drawers, COLUMN properties, etc.
 On my org (emacs-mac 28.2, org 9.5.5, slow laptop) everything is super fast, except org-indent-mode, which takes ~30s to initialize; perhaps that could be done more lazily ala font-lock. Feel free to use or link to this however you like.

 The only thing that comes up in my searches is this reddit thread from 3 years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fro9jy/no_usable_sound_device_driver_found/
 aplay -l returns the following:
 **** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices **** card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC662 rev3 Analog [ALC662 rev3 Analog] Subdevices: 0/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 7: HDMI 1 [LG Ultra HD] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 8: HDMI 2 [HDMI 2] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 9: HDMI 3 [HDMI 3] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 1: Microphones [Blue Microphones], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 
 I also have pulseaudio installed.
 The OP of that reddit post found a workaround by running (start-process "aplay" nil "aplay" "/home/xyz/sounds/message.wav") but that doesn't seem to work for me either.
 i am using Manjaro if that helps.
 I would love to be able to use my chronos setup again! Any assistance or insight would be greatly appreciated!
 edit: the file plays fine outside of emacs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Veautiful (my little front-end Scala.js library) 0.3-M6 has been pushed to Maven Central.
 com.wbillingsley %%% veautiful % 0.3-M6
 com.wbillingsley %%% doctacular % 0.3-M6
 This release will probably also get called "0.3.0" soon. As we get closer to the new (Australian) academic year, my focus tends to shift from updating the library to updating my educational sites / OERs that use it. So, it will probably make sense to give this version the 0.3.0 moniker as several sites with materials will move to it.
 The most noticeable change is that DeckBuilder and Challenge are now in the doctacular package. Rather than having to, somewhat undocumented, import veautiful.templates.
 Some additional methods were also added to make it very quick to write and publish a single slide deck (e.g. from a scala-cli script). Roughly
 import com.wbillingsley.veautiful.html.* import com.wbillingsley.veautiful.doctacular.* import installers.* val root = mountToBody(<.p("loading")) given root.installMarked() DeckBuilder(1920, 1080) .markdownSlides("*Markdown text*") .veautifulSlide(<.div("Some components")) .mountToRoot(root) 
 Naturally, you can also install marked via webpack or any other means (as many of my sites do), but root.installMarked() which is available as an extension method in doctacular.installers provides a very short way to get a markdown parser in if you're just trying to publish a single deck from a script.
 Release notes here https://github.com/wbillingsley/veautiful/releases/tag/v0.3-M6
 API docs are on javadoc.io
 Documentation on https://www.wbillingsley.com/veautiful/ is slowly improving.
 Another example of something built with Veautiful is also up: the hour of code session run as part of the "Science Experience" outreach in Armidale on Jan 18th. Go on, see if you can win at Cards of Doom, or land your lander on the Moon.

 As a member of the Swarm developers, I am happy to announce a new release:
  
https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/releases/tag/0.3.0.0
  
Swarm is a 2D terminal programming game with its own language based on polymorphic lambda calculus.
 The big new feature is an LSP OnHover handling, so you can inspect the types of variables and description of predefined functions in Swarm language. The handler lives in LSP.hs and the code itself is in Hover.hs.
 ​
 OnHover demo with return command.
 Another fun thing is that the playable scenarios can now use arbitrary boolean expressions in their objectives (must form a DAG) so you can have alternative endings or lose early.
 Finally, a rather academic (but useful) improvement is pretty printing of the CESK machine that is used to execute Swarm code. If you run into a bug, at least you will be able to read what happened. :)
 There are many other fixes and improvements including several new playable scenarios and challenges. If you have any questions, feel free to ask here or raise an Issue.

Emacs, the text editor that lets you read mail and play Tetris, is often cast in opposition to the Unix philosophy of “do one thing well” and “combine small programs”. It’s a false dichotomy. Emacs can do a lot on its own and be combined usefully with other programs. 
 run‑command makes the combination convenient through a simple configuration format and an interaction flow that stays out of your way. Instead of reaching for a shell or a specialized major mode, you give run‑command a simple “recipe” and you get a contextual command palette where you can browse, select, and run commands without leaving Emacs.
  
Demo:
 https://i.redd.it/aufb2k4q2dfa1.gif
 I use this daily for compilers/linters in watch mode (think npm test:watch, cargo watch -x run, etc), development servers, and some one-off's (e.g. looking up the word at point in wordnet). For other examples of practical applications, check out the cookbook. For installation, quickstart etc see the website.

 If I do help(numpy.random), for example, the shell prints the line WARNING: terminal is not fully functional, and hitting RET then prints out the relevant documentation page by page, with a prompt at the end in the form of :.
  
  
1. How am I supposed to quit this documentation view? I usually hit q RET at the : prompt, which works, but I get a message reading NameError: name 'q' is not defined.
 
2. I can scroll down the help documentation using C-d (or hitting RET repeatedly), is there anyway to scroll up? Page-up just moves the buffer up, rather than scroll. I guess not, as even in a non-Emacs terminal running the interactive shell there isn't a way to do this. Is there a guide to motion/scrolling in inferior-shell-modes in general?

 This is what I typed and what shows in the terminal if I cat the file:
  (package! simpleclip :recipe (:host github :repo "rolandwalker/simpleclip")) 
 But from within Emacs, it changes what it displays to:  (package! simpleclip :recipe (:host github :repo "rolandwalker..."))  It basically truncates the string literal using an ellipses. I think this is confusing and I don't want it, but I've looked through docs and Google. Ultimately, I don't know what to even call this feature, so I can't really find out how to turn it off.
 Would someone please point me in the right direction?

Some of my diffs show multi-line regions of text that I know have moved into another file with a different file name. I suspend my ediff and find the other copy/copies of the moved text using helm-ag.
 Usually I would use compare-windows to compare the two buffers. However, often the org-mode headings are at a different level. E.G. everything might be promoted a level higher in one buffer than in the other.
 How can I compensate for this? Can I narrow a buffer to a temporary heading level? Or do I have to actually change the headings levels to match and then change them back afterwards?
 It's quite possible that one hunk of text will have been pushed into multiple other files, so I can end up comparing quite a few different files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I am in the process of learning a bit of Haskell and am trying to work out what is possible and impossible when playing with infinite lists.
 One "toy" problem I came up with was the idea of listing out all the possible integer-sided right triangles up to a max length.
 Of course, this is easy if I "pre-define" a triangles list with the max length already a part of it
  triangles maxLength = [(a, b, c) | a <- take maxLength [1..], b <- take maxLength [1..], c <- take maxLength [1..]] 
 and then use an "isRightTriangle" function as a filter for a rightTriangles maxLength function.
 But is it possible to have an infinite triangles list
  triangles = [(a, b, c) | a <- [1..], b <- [1..], c <- [1..]] 
 that is then later truncated for each tuple element? By that I mean essentially
  take 10 triangles 
 but where a take function operates on the individual infinite tuple elements? The above would of course give  [(1,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,1,4),(1,1,5),(1,1,6),(1,1,7),(1,1,8),(1,1,9),(1,1,10)] 
 rather than the combinations of (a, b, c) where each has had take 10 applied
 I understand this would not really be a great way to define things, but I am curious if this is doable or not.

A major contribution from the last few years is the Haskell Language Server (HLS). I wanted to learn more about GHC internals, and the general compilation pipeline. What better way to learn about these than to work on HLS, helping further improve Haskell tooling in the meanwhile?
In this post I will discuss the experience working on HLS during my internship at Tweag.

What is Haskell Language Server?
Before we move on to digging into the inner workings of HLS, let’s first take a look into what HLS is. Quoting the HLS documentation:
The haskell-language-server (HLS) project is an implementation of a server (a “language server”) for the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

 In particular, I notice that in org-mode, M-TAB ultimately tries to autocomplete using the ispell dictionary. Is the best way therefore just to install ispell and add my strings to a user-defined ispell dictionary? That seems awkward.
 Or is it preferable simply to use lazy-completion-table to define a table, and then to define a custom completion function try-my-list which searches that table? Or does that depend on completion.el, which is the wrong thing to use in the textual context of org-mode?
 Basically, I'm confused by the variety of existing autocompletion and template technologies: abbrev, dabbrev, hippie-expand, skeleton, tempel, yasnippet, corfu, cape, etc.. I now use vertico, orderless, and marginalia, but I'm not sure which technology will fit best into this mix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My work laptop is now running windows, and all my project management, notes ecosystem, latex production, general text editing, git management and more is done in emacs. The big pain point is that the speed is an order of magnitude slower on my (newer) win laptop than the older linux one. Do you have any recommendations for this? I read somewhere that it might be related to the win filesystem and that using wsl doesn't really solve speed issues. Virtual boxing would complicate things exponentially I fear. Maybe there is some win-optimised build I am not aware of?! I installed emacs via scoop. Any suggestion is highly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I'm setting up a notes system in emacs using denote and related tools. I had been configuring consult-notes and saw a section on embark support in the readme. However, when I added that code to my init file, I get an error. (I don't know that this functionality is fully necessary but I figured it wouldn't hurt to add)
 Here is the code:
 (defun consult-notes-open-dired (cand) "Open notes directory dired with point on file CAND." (interactive "fNote: ") ;; dired-jump is in dired-x.el but is moved to dired in Emacs 28 (dired-jump nil cand)) (defun consult-notes-marked (cand) "Open a notes file CAND in Marked 2. Marked 2 is a mac app that renders markdown." (interactive "fNote: ") (call-process-shell-command (format "open -a \"Marked 2\" \"%s\"" (expand-file-name cand)))) (defun consult-notes-grep (cand) "Run grep in directory of notes file CAND." (interactive "fNote: ") (consult-grep (file-name-directory cand))) (embark-define-keymap consult-notes-map "Keymap for Embark notes actions." :parent embark-file-map ("d" consult-notes-dired) ("g" consult-notes-grep) ("m" consult-notes-marked)) (add-to-list 'embark-keymap-alist `(,consult-notes-category . consult-notes-map)) ;; make embark-export use dired for notes (setf (alist-get consult-notes-category embark-exporters-alist) #'embark-export-dired) 
 And the warning received when I start up emacs is "Symbol's function definition is void: embark-define-keymap"
 ​
 Is there something I need to change about the code? Or do I need to add something to my configuration of embark (which I can paste into a comment if requested)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 ​
 We've put together a small addition to the hasql ecosystem: hasql-listen-notify (GitHub source).
 ​
 Users may be already familiar with hasql-notifications, the first library in the hasql ecosystem to provide asynchronous notification support. So here are a few reasons you may consider switching:
 ​
 - More "hasqly" API featuring Session where appropriate.
 - No dependency on hasql-pool.
 - Safer identifier escaping that uses PQescapeIdentifier() rather than a custom Haskell implementation.
 - More minimal/fundamental poll / await combinators for receiving notifications, rather than a monolithic waitForNotifications that accepts a callback.
 - Correct reconnection handling: it's possible for a libpq connection object to be temporarily disconnected from Postgres, and this library will not throw an exception in this case.
 - Backend PID from notification payload is not thrown away.
 ​
 Thanks and don't hesitate to file an issue or ask a question.

 All 5 of these programs do exactly the same thing: print "Fibonacci Numbers", then "F(0) = 0", "F(1) = 1", and so on, up to "F(19) = 4181".
 My Haskell version is below. It works fine, but I'm not a Haskell expert, and I'm wondering how others would do it. So, how would you write this and/or do you have any comments on my code? (Keep in mind that I want my code to be nicely organized, modular, and understandable to relative newbies; this isn't code golf.)
 module Main where -- fibo -- Given n >= 0, return Fibonacci number F(n). fibo n = currfib where (currfib, nextfib) = fibopair n -- fibopair -- Given n >= 0, return a pair of Fibonacci numbers: (F(n), F(n+1)). fibopair 0 = (0, 1) fibopair n = (nextfib, currfib+nextfib) where (currfib, nextfib) = fibopair (n-1) -- printListWithName -- Print items in given list, each preceded by "NAME(#) = ", where NAME -- is the first parameter, and # is an increasing index starting at the -- second parameter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For consult users (or the consult curious) minad just added a wonderful new feature to consult: consult-info. I bind it to M-s i. You can choose one or more info manuals to search (comma separated), and then it acts much like consult-grep and friends, searching over the info nodes. 
 Really great for quickly peeking at some topic without the usual rigamarole of entering Info. It's also simple to bind a key to a command to go right to searching your most used info nodes.
 If you add embark into the mix, the power amplifies again: you can narrow down to just the search terms you want using the regular consult "two stage" filtering (e.g #process#async), then embark-export these live filtered results to a Collections buffer, effectively building your own clickable custom index (or three) for the topic(s) you are investigating.
 Clearly the fastest way to RTFM. Take that Google.

 Here, say in project A, I open many files: fileB, fileC, fileD...etc. Let's say I have fileB takes up the whole window (via C-x 0) . I can then easily switch between existing files that I have opened with projectile-display-buffer . I can then choose the buffer/files I want and press Enter. This is all good.
 The problem is this would switch to that buffer but split the screen horizontal. Using the current example, I have fileB and using projectile-display-buffer and pick fileC would result in a horizontal split: fileB on the left, fileC on the right. How do I customize this behavior, i.e. what if I do not want it to split or if I want it to split vertically instead of horizontally?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I was trying to create a new toy project with scala 3 to see what is going on but I almost gave up. After a few attempts that I actually stopped and tried again, I let it run and took entire 10 minutes to create a new project. 
 I never saw it in any language I tried before, even full bloated node projects can build the first time faster that It took me to run a hello world. 
 There is any trick/config/black magic to speed it up?
 It will take all this time each time I add new dependencies or change sbt version? 
 It's not just my connection with maven central since it took a lot of time on the "(this may take some time)" thing before even start downloading jars, I also work with Java I never saw it before.
 Edit: I deleted some sbt caches and tried to run it with gnomon and I had this output 
 ``` sbt run | gnomon 4.1159s copying runtime jar... 167.3534s copying runtime jar...-sbt sbt 1.8.0 (this may take some time)... 168.2152s copying runtime jar...2.17 (for sbt)... 0.6487s [info] welcome to sbt 1.8.0 (N/A Java 17.0.6) 0.1416s [info] loading project definition from /home/OP/projects/th eunamed/project 7.4709s [warn] jline-2.14.6.jar no longer exists at /home/OP/.cache /coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/jline/jline/2.14.6/jline- 2.14.6.jar 0.0947s [info] loading settings for project theunamed from build.sbt ... 204.1043s [info] set current project to TheUnamed (in build file:/home/OP /projects/theunamed/) 1.4517s [info] compiling 1 Scala source to /home/OP/projects/theuna med/target/scala-3.2.1/classes ... 0.1659s [info] done compiling 0.0638s [info] running helloWorld 0.0223s Hello, world 0.3625s [success] Total time: 206 s (03:26), completed Jan 30, 2023, 11:55: 52 AM 0.0001s

 ```
 More than 6 minutes and seems that It even doesn't need to download the project dependencies, It loaded jars and configurations related to sbt only in the slowest steps.

Convince yourself of the previous claim (that the lifting operation can be generalized) about 'ReaderT' by writing and comparing several MonadMn instances for 'ReaderT'.
  
Here's the instance for MonadError found online.
 liftThroughReaderT :: m a -> ReaderT r m a liftThroughReaderT x = ReaderT $ const x class (Monad m) => MonadError e m | m -> e where throwError :: e -> m a catchError :: m a -> (e -> m a) -> m a instance (MonadError e m, MonadError e ((->) r)) => MonadError e (ReaderT r m) where throwError e = liftThroughReaderT $ throwError e catchError m h = ReaderT $ catchError (runReaderT m) (runReaderT . h) 
 I understand the notation m -> e means "e is determined by m". What does e ((->) r) mean?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I would like to share a couple of packages I have been using for some time for FPGA/ASIC design and verification:
 - https://github.com/gmlarumbe/verilog-ext/
 - https://github.com/gmlarumbe/vhdl-ext/
 These add some extensions to SystemVerilog/VHDL and are built on top of Emacs `verilog-mode' and `vhdl-mode' respectively.
 Here are some of their current features:
  
Tree-sitter support (requires Emacs 29)
 Improve syntax highlighting
 Hierarchy extraction and navigation (verilog-ext)
 LSP configuration for `lsp-mode` and `eglot`
 Support for many linters via flycheck
 Improve imenu entries: detect instances, classes and methods
 Code navigation functions for RTL and Verification environments
 Beautify modules and instances (verilog-ext)
 Extended collection of custom and yasnippet templates insertion via hydra
 Additional misc utilities (e.g. code formatter integration for Verilog)
  
Looking forward to receiving some feedback! And contributions are of course also welcome! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am confused by the Tramp documentation regarding the auto save feature. According to the documentation (emphasis mine):
  
4.20 Auto-save, File Lock and Backup configuration 
 To avoid TRAMP from saving backup files owned by ‘root’ to locations accessible to others, default backup settings in backup-directory-alist have to be altered. 
 Here’s a scenario where files could be inadvertently exposed. Emacs by default writes backup files to the same directory as the original files unless changed to another location, such as ~/.emacs.d/backups/. Such a directory will also be used by default by TRAMP when using, say, a restricted file /su:root@localhost:/etc/secretfile. The backup file of the secretfile is now owned by the user logged in from TRAMP and not ‘root’. 
 When backup-directory-alist is nil (the default), such problems do not occur. 
  
First, it states that the default value of backup-directory-alist must be changed to avoid saving root files as a normal user in a local directory.
 But then, it says that it does not happen with the default value.
 When running Emacs (both -q and -Q, master from Dec 4th), it behaves like the first paragraph: when opening a file using su (or remote ssh+su), it warns about writing a local backup and aborts opening if you say no. Therefore, it looks like the last sentence "When backup-directory-alist is nil (the default), such problems do not occur. " is wrong.
 Is it actually wrong, or am I misunderstanding it?

 What is Iron?
 Iron is a refined types system. It enables the user to attach constraints to types, checkable at compile-time or/and runtime.
 scala val x: Int :| Positive = -1 //Does not compile! 
 This is especially useful to avoid invalid domain values:
 ```scala case class User(name: String :| Alphanumeric, age: Int :| Positive)
 User("John", -35) //Does not compile! User("John_", 35) //Does not compile! User("John", 35) //Compiles ```
 Or, at runtime using Eithers:
 ```scala def createUser(name: String, age: Int): Either[String, User] for validName <- name.refineEither[Alphanumeric] validAge <- age.refineEither[Positive] yield User(validNam…]]></summary>

 Is there some programmatic way of knowning which keys or key combinations are not used in a particular window?
 Of course they will be some additional modes which might be using other keys not used by normal/evil, so should be accounted for as well.
 I'm looking for keys on the main row, ie excluding the Function, Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys and numeric keys. That will be limiting, but any routine which can list unused keys in any mode will be fine.

 I bought a MacBook, but it has very little storage space. I learned that emacs can use configuration and rich plug-ins to achieve many functions, such as code editing, document editing, markdown editing, rendering and so on. In addition, I am a programmer, and I usually write some java, scala, python, shell, Go, Rust, nodejs, and a very comprehensive code language assistance is also very useful! Any caring veterans here to tell me how I should be able to start this journey? Or a configuration to let me just dash forward?
 I'm so so sorry about my poor english,
 But I think everyone can feel my appeal, thank you again!

 would make the list into [2,4,6,8] in ghci but what if I wanted to premake the list [1,2,3,4] so that when I call doublemap it will become [2,4,6,8] without having to add the list on ghci.

 I'm learning haskell and also interested in functional programming relatively newly. I used to develop in many programming languages such as Rust, Ruby, Python, C++, C#, Java, Kotlin and Swift. So I got used to all those programming approaches, design patterns etc. After all, I had seen the functional programming way and really loved the idea and that gave me another way of thinking. I'm still learning. 
 I think I understood what a monad is, even that knowledge helped me in oop way of programming. And now I'm learning about monad transformers. I have read a few blogs and pages about them but they are still not that clear to me. 
 Could anyone please explain those to me? Maybe with examples or comparisons to oop. 
 Because such questions always have answers out there but they are usually either so high level therefore only the ones who have experience in the field can understand or so basic examples and information that no one can properly understand the "needs" and the importance of it so it becomes useless. It is why I'm asking here to the community. 
 Thank you for your answers in advance

 Before adding the above line everything in my config was fine. But now it messed up all the formatting in my config.org file like the following example:

 It now creates errors when I load up doom emacs since the config.org was tangled into config.el. I am trying to figure out how to fix the formatting and I am not sure why some of the brackets are red since I never had any issues before.

 tldr; Probably a total noob Q, but I need to edit my config.yaml file on the headless pi running my HA instance. That file needs to be accessed as my home assistant user (not the regular user of my local or remote machine)
 I can:
  
Edit the file remotely:
  
 $ ssh me@raspberry_pi $ sudo -u homeassistant -H -s $ nano /filepath 
  
Visit my regular user's files in emacs:
  
``` SPC .
 /ssh:me@raspberry_pi:/file/path ```
 I am struggling to understand what I need to do within emacs to replicate (1). 
 The main issue I'm finding baffling is the logical jump from editing as my normal user, to editing as the HA user (a user setup with no password). 
 Is anyone able to explain to me like I'm 5?
 Also, maybe a doom emacs issue, but tramp crashes emacs a lot. For example if I mistype a password or file path. Which during trying to figure out the above has caused me to enter many a killall emacs into my terminal emulator

 I understand that Martin Odersky is an academic and his job is to do language research, not necessarily support industry or Scala adoption, so it's not for me to say that Caprese isn't the best way to do that. However, I think it would be much better for it to be released as a completely separate language as opposed to the next version of Scala. Scala 3 is awesome as a language but it was disruptive to commercial efforts in Scala. I am not sure we can take another hit like that.

 - beOrg defaults to using it's org dir in iCloud... is there a way I can link my current ~/org into iCloud? I move between mac and pc and would rather not make my org dir live directly in the clould dir and then need to link out.
 - People mention webdav, are people still rolling their for this?
 - Working Copy would work but then everything has to go through a commit, which seems silly. (I use github, but not for everytime I check off an item).
 ​
 Anyway... what's your setup and how do you like it?

 I want to add line on the 80 character mark. Rather simple think right? But Customizing Emacs is so overwhelming, that I don't even know how to do it. 
 Is there some config file? Is every customizing option in M-x customizing menu? How to save such a settings globally, to have it whenever I run Emacs? 
 Thank you for you answers.

 When I start the interpreter on a default emacs install in Ubuntu, it seems that I can only enter one command at a time. How do I get the interpreter in the bottom window to run all of my code in the top window? Why do I have to re-enter my code into the bottom window? Sorry if this is an obvious question, but I can't seem to figure it out myself

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have written a python function that takes a string input and performs a semantic search in my org-roam-directory and outputs the results in the following format after 2 seconds of computation:
  
[{'score': 0.9137982130050659, 'file:': '/Users/user/org/example.org', 'content': 'In this article, we introduce a new algorithm.'}, {'score': 0.9033759832382202, 'file:': '/Users/user/org/statistical_model.org', 'content': 'Statistical Model for Denoising.'}]
  
So it is essentially a list of dictionary with score, file location, and content. I can call the python function in the command line by invoking: /Users/user/org/anaconda3/bin/python /Users/user/org/sentence-transformer.py "algorithm and model" and then it gives me the above printed output in the terminal.
 I want to present this output in the emacs minibuffer just like consult-ripgrep, and be able to select one of the options and open the file's content in another buffer.
 I am currently trying to do this in elisp as follows:
 (defun open-file-from-python-script (input-string) (interactive "sEnter input string: ") (let* ((python-script-path "/Users/user/org/sentence-transformer.py") (output-string (shell-command-to-string (concat "/Users/user/org/anaconda3/bin/python " python-script-path " " input-string))) (output-list (json-read-from-string output-string)) (file-path (completing-read "Select a file: " output-list :key #'cdr :predicate #'stringp))) (find-file file-path))) 
 However, it does not work and only outputs: Bad String Format: 10
 I am not too familiar with elisp so I was wondering how to do this properly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellows, I am using this repo to build emacs on aarch64 mac. During the building, there are a lot of warning messages like: 
  
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/install_name_tool: warning: changes being made to the file will invalidate the code signature in: /Users/Desktop/build-emacs-for-macos/builds/Emacs.2023-01-26.d865e18.master.macOS-13.arm64/Emacs.app/Contents/Frameworks/libexpat.1.dylib 
  
And after the build finished, the Emacs failed to open with the crushing message that EXC_BAD_ACCESS (Code Signature Invalid). 
 I found a temporary solution that re-signs the emacs (I guess?) with codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/Emacs.app. 
 But, why these warning messages appear, and what's going on about those dylib? Do you guys have met the same issues on your side?

 I changed this before so that I could have emphasized text between a word.
 Now there is an issue that my special blocks (for latex) underlines the text between the #+begin_<environment> and #+end_<environment> lines. Additionally, if I want to caption something w/ attr_latex: :options{caption] the begin_<environment> line becomes begin<environment>. Since neither SRC or EXAMPLE blocks have this issue, I am wondering if there is a solution to fix my issue.

 I'm relatively new to org mode but find it very useful so far. I am wanting to move away from Obsidian and bring my notes into org. I was able to convert my markdown files to org, using pandoc and following some online answers about removing the property drawers that pandoc creates and automating the conversion.
 The admittedly vague question that I have is how to use the tools of org mode to help organize the information. In obsidian I used tags, included nested tags. (I also had some "structure notes" for topics linking to notes) But I wonder what is a good way to do this in org. I'm focused right now on transferring my literature notes, which are notes on one article, book, or chapter. Should I use properties instead of tags? 
 Would anyone be willing to share how they structure their literature notes (or anything similar)? Examples would be great.
 I should also say that I'm currently using citar and am considering using denote (and citar-denote). So if anyone is using those tools and have advice on setting that up, it would also be appreciated.

 \"ghci is not recognised\" - I installed the 'Haskell' extension and installed through GHCup.
 Editing the file in VScode and then loading it into PowerShell terminal works perfectly fine, but I would prefer to use the terminal in VScode instead of having to have PowerShell open. Any help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use corfu with eglot.
 I can make it bring up the completion frame at point, but the frame is just an empty box. I can see it's doing something in the background since CPU usage shoots up, but it's just stuck. If I press C-g a few times, it will eventually render the completion options, but the frame is still frozen.
 I've tried using corfu-terminal as well, in case it was something funky with child frames, but it's the same.
 company-mode seems to work fine.

 I've written a post about Erlang and what, I think, makes it great for implementing reliable distributed systems in:
 https://github.com/stevana/armstrong-distributed-systems/blob/main/docs/erlang-is-not-about.md#erlangs-not-about-lightweight-processes-and-message-passing
 The reason I post it here is because I think it doesn't necessarily look anything like the distributed-process effort and I've started working towards a different approach in Haskell.
 I've already shared some bits of this work in the past couple of weeks, and I got the code for supervised state machines and hot code swappable state machines mostly done. Some more work is still needed on documentation, then I'll post about that here as well.
 As always, I'm curious to hear your thoughts, comments or questions!

 I suspect Emacs doesn't have anything like clojure.spec and those fancy utilities mentioned there, but for someone new to TDD in any language whatsoever, how do I go about writing tests for my Emacs-lisp code?
 My tests now are to make up for the for the lack of types in Emacs first because that is what bites me the most. I know that is the way it is with dynamic languages, whether Lisp, Javascript, Ruby or whatever and that is how these languages get some of their power, but it gets truly frustrating.
 The correctness of the logic comes later as my understanding of Lisp improves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was messing around with a toy compiler concept and had this idea I’ve been wanting to ask about. 
 (Also I suppose it’s not strictly related to Haskell, so feel free to delete this post, but the Haskell community is very lively with new language ideas so it seemed like a good place to start I suppose.)
 TL;DR
 Anyway, some languages have syntax to turn a valid prefix function into an infix function, and could you do so at the type level?
 Such as,
  f :: from X to Y 
 Which denotes that ‘f’ should be between some given ‘x’ and ‘y’. I.e. x f y.
 The idea was to try to mimic methods from OO languages. 
 Furthermore what if we had something like (note the words between fn and the type signature, the function name itself is has name),
  fn has name :: from Person to String -> Bool 
 Such that you could do,
  result = person has name “Colbyn” :: Bool 
 Pretty sweet syntax I’d say, but is this possible?
 Would this be possible to infer and type check? 
 Because idk maybe it's a dumb idea (I was just playing around).
 Thanks! 🙂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have created my first package for Emacs, it is a very small package to manage the resizing of windows. I remember when I started using Emacs one of the things that I found very awkward was the way Emacs handled the resizing of windows. So I've created a way that is more "intuitive" to me and may be useful for those just starting out in Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, my favorite font is JetBrains Mono. It is working great with emacs, although as you can tell by the title, it's missing something. The font seems sharp everywhere else except some aspects of the modeline as shown in the screenshot below. I'm using my own configuration from scratch and i want to note that the blurriness happens even in the default modeline. The blurriness also persists even if i make the font a lot bigger.
 The way i have set my font is the following:
 (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "JetBrains Mono" :height 120) 
 I'm quite new to emacs and i was wondering, maybe i'm setting it the wrong way? Any input as to what might be causing this is very welcome.
 Thank you for your time!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm new to emacs, and slowly building my config. I installed counsel, swiper and Ivy, which seem pretty good. One thing I'd like to be able to do though, is pass the results of a custom find command to counsel. The idea would be that I could fuzzy find over the results of a recursive file search. At the moment, counsel only lets me fuzzy find the current directory, and i have to press C-j each time I want to go deeper into the file tree, which can be a bit slow.
 On the command line I can do something like find ~/ | fzf with some flags to deselect directories or files etc
 Is that achievable with counsel, or do I need to look at a different completion system?
 ​
 Thanks

 What I would like is one of two options:
  
Open the agenda view to see when I am free, and then to schedule an event directly from a focused day on the agenda view. Of course I could use a capture, but then from the capture I'd have to open a date picker and navigate to the same date that I already found via the agenda view, so navigating to the same day twice.
 
Have information about existing events displayed in the date picker.
 
 I'm sure there's an easy way to do this but I haven't found it yet!

 (defun my/custom-elfeed-colors () ;; Custom tag faces (defface elfeed-search-starred-title-face '((t :foreground "#d3869b")) "Highlight starred feeds") (push '(starred elfeed-search-starred-title-face) elfeed-search-face-alist) (defface elfeed-search-podcast-title-face '((t :foreground "#689d6a")) "Highlight podcast entries") (push '(podcast elfeed-search-podcast-title-face) elfeed-search-face-alist) (defface elfeed-search-youtube-title-face '((t :foreground "#fabd2f")) "Highlight youtube entries") (push '(youtube elfeed-search-youtube-title-face) elfeed-search-face-alist))) 
 When I call the function (my/custom-elfeed-colors) the changes don't get applied, but if I go manually to the end of the first line "Highlight starred feeds" and select eval-last-sexp doing it manually applies the change.
 I will make those hex values change depending on the theme, a hook will fire which will change the hex values when changing the color scheme, but it works on the idea that the function is called each time the theme is changed and if the function doesn't apply the face rules then nothing works.
 I'm pretty sure Elisp is aware of the code inside the function but after calling the function it behaves like it is parsed but discarded. Maybe there is another way that tells Emacs to run those line when called no matter what?

 I’m curious about the haskell community’s opinion of what could be done better when it comes to infix operators for these sort of functions. How could it be made more intuitive? Make more sense? And anything similar.
 Basically, if you had the chance to redesign haskell’s stdlib binary operators from the bottom up, what would you do?
 Any input would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

All you need is higher kinded types by Las Safin
Haskellers (and even worse, dependent type brained people) are prone to making complicated types to maximise abstraction and correctness. However, you might be surprised to know that you (technically) need nothing more than ADTs, HKTs, and rank-N types to do almost all of the magic you need.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been attempting to define two sum types and then compose them into a single type. I view this operation as defining two type constructors, each with a set of data constructors of cardinality greater than one, and attempting to form a new set that is their union. I thought this would be fairly straightforward.
 Here is a distilled version of my attempt:
 data As = A1 | A2 | A3 data Bs = B1 | B2 | B3 type A = As type B = Bs 
 And then, despite the appearance of various syntactic innovations, I've had no success. Essentially, I'd like to do something of the sort: type C = A | B, but that does not work.
 So my questions are:
  
If there is a way to properly do this, how to do so?
 
If there is not -- why not? Haskell is very well thought out and so there must be some reason for disallowing such action. Perhaps it's not so much that the action is itself problematic, but that it would interfere with other language semantics. In any case, I'm curious what the reason is. 
 
 Edited: As an aside: the project I'm working on involves parsing. As such, I wanted to create a simple parse tree for a basic 'arithmetic grammar', as in "3 + 2 - 5", etc. To start off, I wanted to create a binary tree and within that tree I wanted the nodes to be able to hold types that were either binary operations or numbers. I don't think this is optimal, but it was what was driving the original attempt. The project is in large part for learning as well. So upon trying to do something like: type NodeVal = Op | Val, errors arise. I'm adding this aside for some context.
 Thank you.

 I am having issues with font-locking and indentation in org-mode.
 For some reason I cannot attach a picture to show the issue for font-locking. Essentially, between consecutive special block definition lines (eg. #+begin_definition above #+end_definition) I end up with the contents in the middle being underlined, and any other special blocks are font-locked to normal text (I'd like these lines to look like the lines of an SRC or EXAMPLE block's definition lines). Additionally, I can work around this by adding empty lines between these blocks, but it is annoying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Some context: ki is a lightweight structured concurrency library. You can find a previous release announcement here on Discourse or here on Reddit.
 ​
 @TristanCacqueray has discovered a small correctness bug affecting ki-1.0.0 and ki-1.0.0.1; now ki-1.0.0.2 has been uploaded to Hackage, the only version not known to contain any bugs ;)
 ​
 In short, a child thread that throws an exception during cleanup induced by its scope closing would likely fail to propagate its exception, leading to deadlock (usually if not always detected by the GHC runtime, which would then blast out BlockedIndefinitelyOnSTM exceptions).
 ​
 Here is the issue: https://github.com/awkward-squad/ki/issues/19
 And the patch: https://github.com/awkward-squad/ki/pull/20
 ​
 Please update your dependencies accordingly and happy new year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started a new job where most of my work is done by remoting into servers. Was trying to use TRAMP but it's pretty hit or miss when editing. So I decided to port over what I could from my local emacs config to the servers. 
 I use evil-mode. When testing my config locally by launching emacs through emacs -nw, I can enter insert mode, and exit via <esc>. However, when running emacs in ssh-ed server in console-mode, I'm unable to exit insert mode with <esc>. From my understanding, it's a terminal issue. However, I'm not sure why it works locally vs not over ssh.
 Does anyone know how to map <esc>? 
 Terminal: Iterm2
 Local emacs version: 28.2
 SSH Emacs version: 25.3.1

 I've got an issue with AutoKey since I've upgraded my hosts from Xubuntu 20.04 LTS to Xubuntu 22.04 LTS: character output of scripts do get inserted wrongly.
 I've written a bug report to AutoKey on https://github.com/autokey/autokey/issues/763
 Since I noticed that emacs -q as well as emacs -nw -q does not show the faulty behavior, I'm wondering if somebody else is facing this issue?
 Maybe somebody has an idea what I might change in my large setup in order to get rid of this issue ...

 I've researched the problem as best I can, but none of the relevant posts seem to have an answer. People seem to be asking the question, but the answers seem like they're answering something different. Maybe I'm just misunderstanding them.
 The behavior I want is to use ESC to "escape" commands and stuff. I hit M-x or C-x or M-x M-f, realize I didn't mean to, then hit ESC to make it go away. I do not want ESC to ruin my window layout. I honestly can't comprehend why anyone would want that to be the default behavior anyways.

It will continue to keep growing and I have begun to wonder the most efficient way to retrieve the information. I could use ripgrep or rg.el to find the notes efficiently, but I imagine that if the database is very huge and I don't have the correct regular expression in use, then I might not retrieve the correct files. 
 Inspired by chatGPT, I was impressed at how it retrieves info from the internet and speeds up my time for finding information even when I do not know the correct keywords. I figured a NLP model primarily trained on my database would be an easier task and I was wondering if someone had already created something like this or how would they go about it?

 So far I have this but it doesn't do what I want:
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") (lambda () (interactive) (query-replace-regexp ".*" "³\&³")))
 I also have a suspicion that this will draw on the entire buffer rather than just the active region, even though I read somewhere that query-replace-regexp should only affect the active region when there is one.
 I know there are other ways of doing this but I've settled on regex replace as that is a single step and I can also undo it in one step. I'd like this to be as non-interactive as possible (e. g. not having to press 'y' to confirm) apart from the command working only on the active region.
 Many thanks!

 Based on this answer, I need to load minted with the newfloat environment. If I try to do this in my setupfile, I end up with an options clash for minted.
 My configuration is sort of a mess too, so I have multiple places where I load the minted package, and I'm not sure how to combine these or which are really necessary to keep... ``` (add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("" "tikz") "minted" "xcolor") (setq org-latex-listings 'minted org -latex-packages-alist'(("" "minted")) org-latex-minted-options '((...options here...))) (add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("cache=false" "minted"))
 ```
 After exporting to pdf, the associated tex code for the #+src block looks like...  \begin{listing} \begin{minted} // code here \end{minted} \caption{ caption } \end{listing} 
 What I would like is to just be able to write in an org-file ```
 +caption: my caption
 +begin_src <insert language>
 // code
 +end_src
 ```
 and have it export appropriately, where in the pdf I have the caption above my code block in the algorithm style.
 Any help is appreciate. Thanks in advance.

 I have this code right now, and I'm sort of stuck. On ghci, this works using reifyNat {- int -} fizzString, but if I take out the -- on the FizzBuzz u, I can't coerce the Nat into a Symbol usefully, because ConsSymbol apparently is not instanced into KnownSymbol.
 ​
 I've asked around on IRC, and I was told that there's no way to usefully instance the FizzBuzz because type-level information disappears at runtime, but I really don't want to have to try to learn Singletons. It's working as long as I don't have to do a type-level show for Nat, but doesn't this suggest that I can somehow finagle the code to work without having to resort to Singletons?
 ​
 
 ​
 Edit: gah, got a regression. I can't even get this code to work without the NatToSymbol stuff. Seems as though I've forgotten something.

 I don't want to start from scratch by defining the type, and Functor and Applicative instances, so I imported Control.Monad.Trans.Except, and used a OVERLAPPING pragma as instructed in the GHC user guide here. 
 {-# LANGUAGE InstanceSigs #-} {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} import Control.Monad.Trans.Except (ExceptT (..)) instance {-# OVERLAPPING #-} (Monad m) => Monad (ExceptT e m) where return :: a -> ExceptT e m a return x = ExceptT $ return (Right x) (>>=) :: ExceptT e m a -> (a -> ExceptT e m b) -> ExceptT e m b x >>= f = ExceptT $ do y <- runExceptT x case y of Left ex -> return (Left ex) Right k -> runExceptT (f k)

I tried asking ChatGPT because I get to torture it indeinitely until I understand, lol. I think I figured it out, but I need confirmation from actual qualified people:
  
We have the category of endofunctors, which in the context of Set/Hask are just all functors (because we’re limited to a single category).
 For any m <= Monad m, we take all morphisms of type Identity a -> m b (natural transformations between functors Identity and m) and make them a separate category.
 That category is a monoid, with (<>) = (>=>) :: (Identity a -> m b) -> (Identity b -> m c) -> Identity a -> m c (Kleisli composition), and mempty = return :: (Identity a) -> m a, where the Identity monad is simply elided for out convenience.
  
Did I get it all right? And if so, wouldn’t the correct definition be “a monad is a monoid in the category of morphisms from the category of endofunctors”? Upd: Or is it what monoid as a category already implies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to understand regular expressions in Emacs. Here [1] I have seen, that parentheses and braces need a backslash in front:
 \( \) start/end of group \{3\} previous character or group, repeated 3 times \{3,\} previous character or group, repeated 3 or more times \{3,6\} previous character or group, repeated 3 to 6 times 
 But brackets do not:
 [...] any character between brackets [^..] any character not in the brackets [a-z] any character between a and z 
 Now, in the minibuffer I can use these rules, BUT in Elisp code I have to use double backslashes where I need only one in the minibuffer.
 Questions
 Can someone please explain, why we need a backslash in front of some characters to begin with? Are they otherwise interpreted?
 Next, why the doulble backslash in Elisp code?

 But suppose also the eval-expression (M-:) command still works for me, and I can still evaluate Emacs Lisp commands.
 In this situation, is there a function or command could I run to set the running Emacs Lisp image back to the state it was in when Emacs first launched (up to loading of init.el) but without loosing any of my open unsaved buffers or halting any running child processes?

 Sometimes I find it annoying to keep track of which prompt caused which output, especially if there are many lines of output for each prompt, meaning I often have to scroll way up (or run comint-previous-prompt) just to check the prompt, and then get back down.
 So, I wrote this pretty simple package that creates a header at the top of a shell-buffer, displaying the prompt above the window. This makes it easier to keep tracks of prompts because you'll always see the prompt associated with every line of output currently visible in the buffer. (see screenshot)
 Here's the package repo with a more detailed README. Feel free to reach out with any questions/critiques/feedback :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 So I need to browse and work on a very large codebase (LLVM). I am not a power user of Emacs with C++, but for what I understood LSP with clangd is now pretty mature. Moreover, IIUC, LSP provides code navigation via Emacs' xref.
 Historically the usual way to explore code was using a tag utility, like ctags, etags, rtags or gtags. I've tried searching online, but the resources I found are pretty outdated, and I suspect they are not even aware of LSP.
 So the question is:
  
would you say an external program is still the best way to explore C++'s code on Emacs, or is clangd + xref enough? Is it becoming the de facto standard? Is there something that a tag program can do but clangd can't (or viceversa)?
 
I have heard that C++ code can be quite difficult to index, due to complex include nests, preprocessor directives and what else (because C++!). Is this problem still relevant in 2023? If yes, what solution handles it best?
 
 Thanks!

 I often want to search forward in the agenda to see when a particular appointment is, and what else is going on that day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just found out on Bastien Guerrys page with org advice (https://bzg.fr/en/some-emacs-org-mode-features-you-may-not-know/) that S-RET in a table can increment a date stamp by a day. That would be a wonderful help for me.
 But when I hit S-RET in the leftmost cell in the last row, the next row isn't started with 2023-01-21, but with 2024-01-20. 
 | 2023-01-18 | 18.035 | 22.579 | | 2023-01-19 | 18.056 | 22.603 | | 2023-01-20 | 18.046 | 22.592 | 
 How can I make org-table-copy-down work with the days instead of the years? The variable org-table-copy-increment was set to t, I tried setting it to 1, but that didn't help.
 Thank you for any advice!

Maybe I can create specific notes about the definition of Internet and Web and link them? Create a note about the relationship between those two terms? Help me make it better!

# Web and Internet Are Different Terms

It is common to observe people using the terms _Web_ and _Internet_ in such a way that it appears that both define the same concept: a giant invisible network that interconnects people and realities. However, it is important to understand that both terms have different meanings, although they are connected.

The Internet is the medium through which all information travels between servers and users. This information, being very general, needed to be contained in standards so that all connected devices could understand and communicate with each other. Therefore, the Internet is made up of applications that exercise this function of regulating communication through protocols.

The Web is an Internet application. It allows users to interact with servers through websites: interactive pages that allow navigation between files and pages present on the server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm happy to announce the third part of a five part tutorial on property-based testing stateful systems in general, and distributed systems in particular:
 https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial/blob/main/docs/Part03SMContractTesting.md#readme
 In the previous part we introduced concurrent state machine testing to test for race conditions using linearisability.
 In this part we will build upon the second part and show how to test bigger systems in a modular way. We introduce the property-based testing equivalent of fast and deterministic integration testing against fakes and show how to ensure that the fakes are faithful to the real components.
 I hope to announce part four on fault-injection next week.
 Any questions, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using straight.el to manage Emacs packages, however for some reason I have incorrect Tramp version, at least this is how Tramp reports it via tramp-version command. The reason I ask about this is Ivy stopped working with su:: if I use Tramp installed by straight.el.
 If I put this in my config, then tramp-version reports 2.5.1.1 and Ivy doesn't work when I type su:: prompting an error:
 (straight-use-package 'tramp) 
 If I remove this line, then Tramp reports a newer version (the one that comes with Emacs 28.2 which I use), then Ivy works correctly.
 I checked files manually at straight/repos/tramp and it seems that the Tramp version should be 2.6.0, but for some reason it isn't. I can't even find a string 2.5.1.1 in the whole repo of Tramp so I'm not sure where it's coming from.

 Expr is a Rose tree, but that's irrelevant to the question since the evaluation happens on a string.

 If you have read both books, can you pick me one option from the following: 
  
Read SICP only - (my guess: it's a great book about FP so you don't need to read "Functional Programming in Scala" any more) 
 Read "Functional Programming in Scala" only - (my guess: This book covers most of the general FP concepts in depth so no need to read SICP any more)
 Read SICP then "Functional Programming in Scala" - (my guess: "Functional Programing in Scala" doesn't tell FP thoughts in an easy-to-understand way so you want to read SICP at first)
 Read "Functional Programming in Scala" then "SICP" - (my guess: "Functional Programming in Scala" is in depth enough, but it doesn't cover FP topics outside Scala. So you want to read SICP later)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a directory of files with properties like Type Start Fin Title etc.
 I'm not sure it's possible after thrashing on it a bit last night and some googling, but I'm trying to come up with a boolean query that looks for anything with a Start >= 2022-01-01 and where the Fin date is >= 2023-01-01 or where the Fin date is /not/ present.
 So, as pseudocode: (start >= 2022-01-01) AND ( Fin >= 2023-01-01 OR Fin ""))
 Something like:
 tags "Type={.}+Start>="<2022-09-23>"+{ Fin>="<2023-01-01" \| Fin = "" }"
 So, first off,
  
Not quite sure to ask for a second condition (ie. >= and !=) on a prop. I've only seen +Fin={this \| that} example-wise
 How is a NOT done (I had assumed it was !=) but that does not give (my =] ) expected output. Can you even query on the non-presence/no-value of a property?
 Also, not sure those queries honour math order of ops?
  
Is there a way to create that query with those 3 properties or do I need to add another prop like Done: false to get around the above issues? (ie. Start in 2022 AND (Fin since 2023 OR DONE=false) )

I understand it's possible to pass a table and some other data types into a python script, but I can't find anything about passing headlines or the content of org files. 
 So in short it'd be cool if I could pass an inline python script a headline :ID: (or its name in the worst case) literate-programming style and then access its child headlines (and maybe even its :PROPERTIES: tags) as a structure to generate a graph from. 
 Does anyone know if this is possible, or if there's a way to achieve something similar? Thanks.

 Alas, running org-protocol needs to be authorized in Firefox. However, it used to ask for permission "once and for all", but after I made a fresh OS install, now Firefox asks for permission on every site I want to run org-protocol in, which is certainly inconvenient.
 I'm not sure the newer OS got me a more recent Firefox version (current is 109.0) for which the policy changed, or if something in my settings was lost along the way. Does anyone else get the same behavior? Does anyone know how to tell Firefox to just run org-protocol whatever the site?

 (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c gdl") '(find-alternate-file "~/downloads"))

 When i run this I get an error "Wrong type argument: commandp".

 Does anyone know what I am doing wrong? Maybe it has something to do with interactive and non-interactive functions (I only do a little coding as a hobby so I haven't learnt about that yet)?
 ​
 Also, I'd rather not use C-c as a prefix, but just use 'g' as a prefix for jumping to shortcuts in dired. Is there a way to set that up?

 I am wondering whether the following is possible in Scala:
  
Given some vector x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) in R^n and a function f that maps R^n to R, I would like to replicate this concept in Scala. The idea of Scala's partial function/currying should hold here (i.e. when applying a single value x_i, return a function that is defined only for a subset of its input domain). For example, when n = 2 define f(x, y) = sin(x + y), then trivially, f(2, y) = sin(2 + y).
  
However, the dimension (n > 0) may vary from case to case and may even be provided in input. Partial application for n = 2 is:
 def leftPartialFunction(f: (Double, Double) => Double)(x: Double): Double => Double = f(x, _) 
 but how can this be generalized for arbitrary n?
 For example, how can I apply the function in position i?Something like this I assume would not work ...
 def partialFunction(f: IndexedSeq[Double] => Double)(xi: Double): IndexedSeq[Double] => Double = .... // cannot work well with indexed seq as they are not "disjoint"

 For some context:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Basically the title. When I execute the following code in a Julia repl, 
 a=[0 0.5 0.5;0.75 0 0.25;0.75 0.25 0]; print(map(x->getindex(a^3,x),[1,4,7])) 
 I the definition for a is empty, as I've silenced the output with the semicolon.
 However, when I run this code from within org-mode, I get the following output: 
  #+RESULTS: : 3×3 Matrix{Float64}: : 0.0 0.5 0.5 : 0.75 0.0 0.25 : 0.75 0.25 0.0 : [0.1875, 0.40625, 0.40625] 
 That last row is the one I actually wanted to print, whereas the Matrix definition output should definitely not be there.
 I assume one of two things is happening: either org-mode is ignoring the semicolon when it executes the src block, resulting in this error, or julia is wigging out in the org-minibuffer since it's not in a vterm (which apparently matters to julia for some reason).
 I've referred to the julia specific docs, as well as the org-mode evaluation of code blocks and results of code execution docs, with no solution. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

To record timelapses of drawings, just use the camera with the left hand while you paint with the right and record a couple of seconds.
Paul Heaston (@paulheaston) shared on Instagram that he's not using tools to hold his camera while he's recording sketches most of the time instead of using a table mount.
Usually, he picks up the phone mid-sketch with the left hand, draws with the right, and records the drawing process for a couple of seconds only to capture something interesting on video. Finally, combine the clips into 1 video.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A common pattern I've found has been wanting to chain m (Maybe a)s, such as IO (Maybe a)s, or Parser (Maybe a)s (where a may differ at different points). The obvious way to me to do this would be
 (>>=?) :: Monad m => m (Maybe a) -> (a -> m (Maybe b)) -> m (Maybe b) xm >>=? f = xm >>= \case Just x -> f x Nothing -> pure Nothing 
 or use MaybeT like
 (>>=?) :: Monad m => m (Maybe a) -> (a -> m (Maybe b)) -> m (Maybe b) xm >>=? f = runMaybeT $ do x <- MaybeT xm MaybeT $ f x 
 but the pattern seems common enough that I feel like there would be a "best practice" or accepted way to do so, or some existing operator, that I'm unaware of. It also feels like there should be some way to generalize Maybe to any instance of MonadFail but I haven't been able to figure that out.
 Is there a less verbose way of doing this, or are the two options above what I should stick with, or are there existing implementation(s) somewhere in some library/libraries that are accepted as the idiomatic way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just looking at something I'd written earlier in the week and noticed that org-mode had (somehow) changed a source code block I'd created from having the emojis I'd had in it (quite a few, which is how I noticed), to escaped numeric codes. I am unsure why this may have happened (and the fact is, I can add in the emojis but the file is a bit broke at the moment.
 Eg. 🐧 to \360\237\220\247 
 Is there any particular reason why this would have happened, and more to the point, is there a way to prevent it? (I should point out I'm on OSX and these were default emoji from Apple's font.). It's the first time I've seen it happen in files (though I recently changed my config which, for example, removed the Apple emoji front from being defaulted.). I'm on emacs 29.0.60. Latest version of org-mode and using org-roam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm wondering if anyone else is using the Haskell Language Server + CoC + Vim, and how useful they're finding it. To be honest, I'm finding it has only one advantage over ALE + Vim + the now defunct Intero – namely, it offers auto-completion – and has a number of drawbacks (no way to get a variable's type, that I can see, and requires an entire Node.js installation). Is there some killer feature of HLS that I'm missing?
 tbh, most of what I'd want out of HLS can already be got from ghci (using the :type-at and :loc-at commands), so I'm thinking of writing a small Vim plugin to hook ghci into Vim similar to what Intero did.

 It has a few other related features as well.
 It has really improved my experience editing LaTeX in emacs, and I'm sure it would be useful to anyone who does so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using eglot for coding c++, which is lightweight and provides just enough functionalities for me (Glad it's integrated into emacs 29!)
 One thing I'm not 100% satisfied is the diagnostics when the cursor is hovering on a symbol. By default it shows the information in the echo area through eldoc, which is not quite convenient because usually it's far from where the cursor is. A better solution is provided by eldoc-box, which shows information in a child frame, like this.
 As can be seen in the screenshot, the child frame blocks some part of the window. I'm wondering if possible to set the child frame transparent so that I can see the code below. I tried to set eldoc-box-frame-parameters with (alpha . 0.5) but it has no effect. What do I miss?
 Moreover, the eglot shows the information with some formatting. There is a long line separating different kinds of information, which is fine for the echo area, but in the child frame, it is wrapped into several pieces, occupying additional lines. I'm curious if there is a way to change the format. 
 Another question which is related is that the documentation is truncated. I'd rather to see a long child frame to show all the information, which is usually possible if there is no redundant things like the wrapped line. I cannot find an option in eglot to turn off the truncation. Is there any solution for this problem?
 Thanks for reading this long post!

 I'm trying to setup my emacs to edit markdown files.

 Does anyone have a setup like this? I found this, but I'm wondering if there's a solution that works per fragment instead of per line (and isn't a "quick and dirty proof of concept", as the author describes it).
 Thanks!
 edit: add links to org-appear and org-fragtog

 But according to my experience, on my mediocre desktop, it probably takes less than 10 minutes for native compilation. And I wonder if I'm doing it in a correct way. I run `./configure --with-native-compilation` then `make -j$(nproc)`. I also tried `make NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1 -j$(nproc)` per EmacsWiki. But the compilation time is always very well under 10 minutes. After compilation, the evaluation of (native-comp-available-p) returns t.

 Here TxGVNN/guxti is my Guix channel to maintain packages and patches.
 Pros
  
Patches are centrally stored, easy to see what is patch and don't need to fork any source to modify.
 Reproducible, I can roll back any point (time traveling).
 It will be easy to install package need external libs like vterm, telega(Telegram client), tree-sitter,...
 Build your ELPA by elpa-mirror power tool. I exported to my giaelpa TxGVNN/giaelpa@master, so it still works well for my dotfiles without GUIX
 Keep working with use-package style.
 With guix pack --format=deb I can install all of them (emacs version, packages, 3rd libs) on debian machine without GUIX
 When cloud IDEs are using more (Gitpod, Codespace), it helps me to a certain uniform environment. I implement on my Gitpod dotfiles, you can have a look TxGVNN/gitpod@701546
  
Cons
  
Heavy and slow, I think

I want it to be a vertically-displayed completing-read menu over some sources (recent files, recent buffers, bookmarks, etc.). I can write the completion command easily enough (and I already use vertico, so I would get the standard vertical display), but I want the completion candidates to fill the a whole window, a bit like vertico-buffer does. Importantly, I only want this to happen for this one thing -- the dashboard -- I don't just want to enable vertico-buffer generally. If I switch to another buffer and invoke a minibuffer command, it should show up at the bottom like usual.
 It would be really great if invoking any minibuffer-using command while in the dashboard buffer would reuse the dashboard buffer for completion, but that might be a separate issue.

So I ran the uninstall program and I realize it's deleting other programs in my folder... I had Blender, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, DaVinci, etc. Now because most of it got corrupted, I now will have to reinstall most of them. I just formatted my pc recently so fortunately there wasn't much. But GOD DAMN.

 I have two ideas to install this package:
  
git clone to one of the load-paths and just use-package. cons: I need install the dependencies first.
 use straight.el (maybe? I just start to read its long readme).
  
Then I find there is a ejira/ejira-pkg.el file in the repo, is that the package definations? Can I use this file directly to install the ejira with all its dependencies automaticly?

 manager' <- newManager defaultManagerSettings res <- runClientM (<object> :: ClientM Type) (mkClientEnv manager' <url>) 
 where <object> is some big tree like structure which needs many requests to build. The problem is that the lichess API is rate limited (here they say: only one request at a time and wait for a minute after receiving 429). Is there a way to slow down servant-client (or http-client) so that they obey these restrictions?
 I haven't found anything in the docs of servant-client or http-client, and googling only gives result for the server side part. servant-rate-limit has a client module, but when you look at the code you see that it doesn't do anything. managerConnCount and managerIdleConnectionCount don't help either.

 The functions delete|remove, delq | remq remove an element from the list, with the former using equal to compare and the latter eq to compare.

eq
  
Return t if the two args are the same Lisp object.
  
(delete '(a b) ((a b) a b c d e) works and (delq '(a b) ((a b) a b c d e)) doesn't.
 Why do eq and equal treat the (a b)/'(a b) comparison differently?

 https://github.com/vifon/tmsu.el
 While not a full replacement for more intricate TMSU CLI use cases, tmsu.el handles all the regular workflows such as tagging, tag modification and tag based queries (with results in dired, similar to M-x find-dired).
 It was one of my goals to integrate tmsu.el with the Emacs ecosystem as well as possible:
  
tag editing uses the standard completing-read-multiple (or any frontend to it, such as vertico)
 most dired features are usable in the query results
 the queries can be saved both with the Emacs-native bookmarks (C-x r m) and the org-mode links (M-x org-store-link)
  
Here is a screenshot of an example query made with M-x tmsu-dired-query:
 https://preview.redd.it/m3frsus24fda1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1bbe0270074bf8186bb416fb86c6529d3ba4d866
 tmsu.el was usable for quite a while, but only recently I've published it as a separate project (previously it was just living in my ~/.emacs.d/) and consider its feature set relatively complete and stable. Hopefully someone else will find it as useful as I do!
 Any further input is very appreciated.

 In this post I’ll describe how to write a minimalistic Haskell persistence layer (on top of HDBC). My approach will rely heavily on Generics (Data.Data, Data.Typeable) and Reflection (Type.Reflection).
 The overall design goal is to avoid any boilerplate code for the API user.
 The library is by no means complete. Right now it’s just a proof of concept. But it shows that it is possible to use Generics to eliminate a lot of handwritten code for API users.
 I’m explicitely asking for your feedback here:
  
Do you regard such a persistence library as useful?
 Do you have any suggestions for improvements?
 Which feature would you like to see most urgently?
 Do you think it makes sense to extend this proof of concept to a full fledged solution, or are there already enough libraries out there that do the same?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see that a lot of people have moved into org mode, and say org mode is amazing as task management solution. So I've been convinced org mode is the ideal task management tool for geek.
 Then I discover that org mode miss some essential basic feature for task management. For instance, I estimated the effort for a project. After finishing some tasks, I try to track the remaining effort to complete the project. I discover that there is no straightforward solution to do that in org column view, org column view can only display estimated effort. I should write a custom function for this basic and essential feature of task management. No built-in solution or elisp package exists for that. Only a advanced emacs user (who masters elisp) can do this basic and essential action. I suppose probably that it exists maybe other basic and essential feature aren't implemented in org mode.
 That make me to doubt when so many people says org mode is a amazing task management tool. Did they used really org mode in production for task management? I can't understand how people can survive in task management without such feature.
 Org mode is maybe a good platform to build a task management tool, but it isn't a mature task management tool.
 Fortunately,org can export to taskjuggler, I intent to explore the taskjuggler solution.

 tags "TODO=\"TODO\"+SCHEDULED<=\"<today>\"+PRIORITY=\"A\""
 Is bringing up Todos with priority A, but also those with no priority. I can filter those no priority ones out with an org-agenda-skip-entry-if command (notregexp to drop anything that’s not explicitly [#A]) but that seems like it should be unnecessary.
 And then, I can’t figure out how to show anything due today/overdue with no priority in a separate search. What’s the best command for that?
 Any thoughts for me?
 —-SORT OF SOLVED—-
 I set the default priority to “D” (which is not one of the priorities I cycle through) and set up a search for that priority. Not sure if that’s the orthodox solution, but it works.

 Need a slick, "modern" countdown timer for the Lunar New Year? Of course Emacs can do it! I'm working on a screencap. This package won't be on any package repository soon, so use the install instructions for straight, elpaca etc.
 Also see the countdown package.
 I left some notes in the Elisp so you can figure out where to customize further.
 I'm also working on another "game" package that is similar to snow, but we will see if it's time time for this Lunar New Year or has to wait until next NYE.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a mathematics graduate student who has been dabbling with Emacs for a little under a year, on and off. I have the following use case, and I've felt a little overwhelmed at the possible choices of packages, so I'd like some advice on how to set up something that works for me.
 In my studies I often find myself encountering problems and ideas that I had thought about a long time ago, but can no longer reconstruct. What I'd like to create is a system where I can dash off my summary of a theorem or proof technique that I encounter, and be able to link these documents to each other. More specifically, I'd like to have a big folder filled with LaTeX files (or org files) that are tagged somehow so I don't have to keep track of them myself. I want to be able to refer to specific theorems/definitions/equations in other files in the system, as I would in LaTeX. And, importantly, I want to be able to produce a nicely formatted PDF from a selection of these files, with all the internal links to equations, definitions etc. working properly. So for example if this semester I'm studying harmonic analysis, I want to produce notes on all the theorems and techniques I pick up, and by the end I should be able to stitch them together in a PDF. If next semester something I'm studying relies on one of those theorems, I want to still be able to point to the corresponding file and again include it in a different PDF. A nice plus would be the ability to smoothly manage citations and references to books, papers etc.
 There are packages in the so-called personal knowledge management ecosystem (org-roam, deft, org-brain, Zetteldeft etc.) that seem to do what I'm looking for. I'd appreciate anyone who's tried out a bunch of them giving their opinion on what makes the most sense to do. If anyone's done something similar, any advice, links or helpful blog posts describing your setup would be very appreciated.

 Since it's really easy to export your agenda to a file, what conky is doing now is just reading the file where I export my default agenda view of the week. But I've encountered a few problems:
  
I would like to make the days of the week different colored, but since conky is just reading the file it's not possible (at least I couldn't do it, please tell me I'm wrong)
 The TODO and priority levels are really annoying (this is easier to deal with, but still)
 I have multiple files for different tasks. While I do want all the tasks to be listed and, when I'm on agenda view, from which file they come from, again, is really annoying on conky
  
Have any of you guys dealt with this before? How would you implement that?

 When running as a script I used (file-name-directory load-file-name), but that is nil when running the file with eval-buffer etc.. So for those cases I use the default-directory variable. This is my current solution:
  (defun my/get-script-directory () (if (null load-file-name) (expand-file-name default-directory) (file-name-directory load-file-name)) 
 My main concern is that default-directory does not always point to the same directory that the file is in since it can be changed with cd. 
 Thanks in advance!

 EDIT2: I found org-info-js which is said to be outdated. 
 Ideally to be used across several subpages, beyond the way Read-The-Org simple wiki page layout. Use case: for knowledge base building, and quick access. I explain something to a co-worker and, using their computer, I can quickly search a topic I am explaining, and this topic is present on my website with my openly available notes.
 I could not see a search box in the pages generated from org to html.Someone said a few years ago that this required JavaScript to run, and that was not a feature of org to html conversion at a time.
 What are the solutions today?Thank you for your help and support. Please point me to right direction if I missed something obvious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, been using emacs and Org Mode for a few years now. global-auto-revert-mode used to work fine -- if I changed a file remotely, the emacs process would pick it up and revert that file's buffer.
 Around 6 months or so ago it became only 'intermittently' working... maybe 1 out of 5 or 10 times, it will notice the file has changed and revert the buffer. Most of the time (almost always) it doesn't. I find myself now doing 'C-x x g' to revert by hand, before I start modifying my Org agenda, otherwise I'll have a conflict when I try to save.
 I have this in my .emacs:
 '(global-auto-revert-mode t)
 I have also tried it with '1' instead of 't' but made no difference.
 My setup is:
 - Fedora 37 as a Virtualbox VM (running under a Windows 10 host)
 - emacs version 28.2
 - file in question is being synchronized via Syncthing (the remote device is an Android phone, as my main use case is Orgzly)
 I've done some searching but haven't found an answer for this scenario so far. Can anyone give some pointers on what else I might look for, or any means of directly troubleshooting this?

 (setq default-frame-alist '((top + -334) (left + -3769) (width . 230) (height . 75))) (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 230 75) 
 The result is it pops from the laptop to the main monitor, but the height is clipped to the height of the laptop. And the minibuffer and modeline are gone/hidden, like the bottom of the frame is truly clipped. Any meaningful interaction in this state, like expanding an org headline, results in a crash/core dump.
 I need to drag the bottom a bit with the mouse to snap emacs out of it and get the minibuffer back and leave the crash-ready state.
 Executing the set-frame works fine when the frame is already on the second monitor, but i can recreate the same issue by moving the window to the laptop and executing the size and then dragging the window back.
 Anyone experience this? Ideas for a fix? Thankyou for any info.

I want to surprise him by learning it and making a game in Haskell as a gift for his birthday in March. But I don’t know how Haskell works or if you can even use it for games.

 I would like to tell helm~ag to ignore showing files that have the extension ".org_archive", and probably later also ".html".
 Based off the sample configuration on the github readme...
 (custom-set-variables '(helm-ag-base-command "ag --nocolor --nogroup --ignore-case") '(helm-ag-command-option "--all-text") '(helm-ag-insert-at-point 'symbol) '(helm-ag-ignore-buffer-patterns '("\\.txt\\'" "\\.mkd\\'"))) 
 ... I figured that that would require me to add the following to my emacs init.el file:
 (custom-set-variables '(helm-ag-ignore-buffer-patterns '("\\.org_archive\\'" "\\.html\\'")) '(helm-ag-ignore-patterns '("\\.org_archive\\'" "\\.html\\'")) ) 
 I probably don't need both. However this doesn't seem to be true. I.E. it doesn't exclude those files, although I do see my customisations via customize-group.
 Can someone please tell me what I'm failing to understand?
 Thank you.

 I sometimes accidentally create new captures with wrong inputs by mistake or choose the wrong template. I then try to abort the capture process (C-c C-k or org-capture-kill). Unfortunately, this still creates an empty file for that capture and performs a find-file on it. 
 I added :no-save t to my templates (inspired by this thread), but this makes aborted captures' buffers to stay open. Adding :kill-buffer t somehow causes org-capture to write the file to disk on abort (ignoring :no-save t). 
 Is there a way to not create an empty file and to close the capture buffer when aborting an org-capture process?

 If it isn't supported by the core language, I'd appreciate links to libraries implementing this functionality via FP primitives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a junior self taught developer (for +- 2 years). Currently ending a 9 month front/back-end + python course. I like working with Django.
 I am currently intensely looking for my first job position as a developer where I will work with python and Django.
 My question is - should I mention in my CV and be proud of that I am using Emacs as my text/code-editor/note taking app/calendar/etc, because that will show, that I like to tweak things not only for work, but for my own pleasure, I don't feel the need to use what everyone else is using, I like to understand the tools that I am using, I value efficiency(after using emacs for almost a few years, I can not imagine writing code and using my mouse or arrow keys often) and etc... 
 Or... it will show that I am weird for using some ancient editor and it's going to be too hard to blend me in a team of other developers using vscode and stuff.
 Curious to know what you think.

 First of all: I want to say thanks for that whole thread, I really enjoyed reading some of the feedback. There were some recurring questions and comments there, so I decided it best for me to address them all in one place.
 There I was also visually adviced to write an elevator pitch to quickly explain the central point (thanks, u/tonicinhibition). You can read that here now: Project Mage: The Elevator Pitch.
 And if you want a more detailed discussion and motivation for structural editing, there's the Rune section here: The Power of Structure/Rune.

 Does M-x org-roam-capture-templates RET support to have a key to create directories?
 It would be good to have something like M-x org-roam-node-find RET p RET active RET paper RET, where p corresponds to some template and a projects directory.
 Now there is another problem, when one does
 mv projects/active/paper.org projects/done/paper.org 
 org-roam-node-find would not find paper.org. Edit: nevermind, had to org-roam-db-clear-all and org-roam-db-sync.
 TLDR how to have an org-roam-template choice with a recursive directory/filename choice? Found out, that I can move files in my org-roam-directory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was using neovim - but had some issues related to indentation that I couldn't fix, and the community also seemed to agree that it was a known issue, and so I moved to using doom emacs.
 ​
 So I moved to doom emacs - tested the indentation, and it was flawless, exactly how I wanted it to perform.
 ​
 What I want, which was working:
 - If I open a block, auto indent ready for typing based on where the block currently is
 - If I delete all indentation in front of a line, and hit tab, autoindent that line to it's correct indent level
 - If I have a line indented correctly, and hit backspace at the beginning of that line, remove 1 indentation (even if this would be incorrect to what is expected)
 - If I have a line indented correctly, and I tab at the beginning of the line, indent that line once (even if this would be incorrectly indented)
 ​
 This is pretty much exactly how VSCode handles indentation for PHP, it's very practical and flexible.
 ​
 I want to know how I can get back to this, because today after opening my emacs, if I hit tab, the editor will just check if the line is correctly indented, and fix it as per it's own opinion. 
 I do not want this aggressive style of controlling indentation, because it is not at all practical of what I actually need from emacs
 ​
 For context - I work on an eCommerce site, the entire project is 7 million lines of code, and not one single file has been well mantained - some of the files are 30 thousand lines long.
 ​
 Of course - one option would be to try and indent the entire file, but then I can't get my PRs approved on GitHub.
 ​
 Accepting the aggressive indentation is not an option for me, I need to be able to have flexible control over it.
 ​
 Can anyone suggest ideas for this?
 ​
 Currently, C-h k is set to c-indent-line-or-region

 many Emacs users don't use eshell very much.
 Many users of other shells, are not familiar with eshell's features and capabilities.
 On a Slovak Linux site a while ago I published an article about eshell, aimed at a wider audience who don't use Emacs, and I mentioned some of the features that make it interesting and attractive.
 Maybe it makes sense for English-speaking users (of PC, Linux), so I made a translation of it (note: English is not my native language, so please forgive mistakes and awkward expressions).
 (BTW: I use eshell as a daily tool and I can't imagine going back to another shell. )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm evaluating scala3 for the type of applications I do (business logic in logistics, e-commerce) and I'm looking to scratch an itch I've been having with other languages and their ecosystems.
 First some definitions
  
a clean domain model is a package/module/layer which does not depend on anything but the language and itself
 no external libraries, in-line annotations (eg javadoc) or off-line annotations (eg xml) are allowed in the domain model
 the domain model can provide contracts that other models/modules can implement in order to pass data into the domain model; data can also be injected by constructing model entities outside of the model and passing them as parameters to the model
  
With all this in mind, I landed at the first candidate: slick from https://scala-slick.org/ that you all probably know.
 Given my requirements, I have an issue with the example on their front page
  class Coffees(tag: Tag) extends Table[Coffee](tag, "COFFEES") { 
 because their abstraction requires me to pass into the model an abstraction specific to the library (a table), but I need to pass into the model the Coffee type defined above (supposedly defined in the domain model).
 Basically the extends gets in the way. I would envision my requirement being met if the slick abstractions would be mixins, and my class StorableCoffee would extend Coffee and mix into itself the storage features from slick.
 Then I would be able to pass into the domain model StorableCoffee, but to the model that would just be a Coffee.
 So since I've never coded in scala, my questions are:
  
is it possible to achieve my goal without convoluted scala3 artifacts and slick or another library?
 if not, what are the possible hacks I could employ?
