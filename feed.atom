        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.16 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Copilot has been used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA's Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.
 This new version provides comprehensive tests for the C99 backend, and introduces a breaking change in the definition of the type Arg in copilot-language. For details, see [2]. The new version is already available on Hackage [4].
 As always, we're releasing exactly 2 months since the last release. Our next release is scheduled for Sep 7th, 2023.
 We are also extremely excited to announce that Copilot has received full approval for release as NASA Class D open-source software. Current emphasis is on increasing test coverage for the two remaining libraries without tests (copilot-language and copilot-theorem), removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo [3].
 There have been many updates on the Copilot front in the last few months. We'll be able to announce more soon. Stay tuned. Happy Haskelling!
 Ivan

 Every few months I check the NEWS file for the master branch of Emacs to keep up with anything that'll be useful to me. This time around, I discovered a built-in way to have a right-aligned modeline! (Added April 1, 2023.)
  
Modeline elements can now be right-aligned. Anything following the symbol 'mode-line-format-right-align' in 'mode-line-format' will be right-aligned. Exactly where it is right-aligned to is controlled by the new user option 'mode-line-right-align-edge'.
  
Put simply, all modeline elements following mode-line-format-right-align are right-aligned (according to the mode-line-right-align-edge setting). My modeline looks like this:

        <updated>2023-07-08T04:24:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found this answer:
 ``` (eval-after-load 'dired '(progn (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "c") 'my-dired-create-file) (defun create-new-file (file-list) (defun exsitp-untitled-x (file-list cnt) (while (and (car file-list) (not (string= (car file-list) (concat "untitled" (number-to-string cnt) ".txt")))) (setq file-list (cdr file-list))) (car file-list))
  (defun exsitp-untitled (file-list) (while (and (car file-list) (not (string= (car file-list) "untitled.txt"))) (setq file-list (cdr file-list))) (car file-list)) (if (not (exsitp-untitled file-list)) "untitled.txt" (let ((cnt 2)) (while (exsitp-untitled-x file-list cnt) (setq cnt (1+ cnt))) (concat "untitled" (number-to-string cnt) ".txt") ) ) ) (defun my-dired-create-file (file) (interactive (list (read-file-name "Create file: " (concat (dired-current-directory) (create-new-file (directory-files (dired-current-directory)))))) ) (write-region "" nil (expand-file-name file) t) (dired-add-file file) (revert-buffer) (dired-goto-file (expand-file-name file)) ) ) 
 ) ```
 here. It does what I like, which is that pressing c will create a new file in dired mode, but what I don't like is that it's by default named untitled.txt. For example, if I press c in dired with this inside ~/.emacs.d I get Create file: ~/.emacs.d/untitled.text, but what I want is Create file: ~/.emacs.d/ so I can pick the name myself. How can I accomplish this?
 I tried editing the code myself but it didn't work as I expected. I'm not very familiar with Elisp.

 The problem is that id is totally useless not only because I refer to the main heading (so domain/otherfile.html is equivalent) but also the html file does not contain any div with that ID, so even when I refer to a subheading instead of the file, the ID does not work. 
 Is there anyway to change this behaviour? I expect it to link to the file only (without ID), however, when a subheading is refered to instead of the main heading itself, then a working id should present.

 Haskell seems to have the opposite problem: too many frameworks and options! Could someone suggest a roadmap of interesting frameworks/libraries which manage the complexity of modern web services with novel (compared to Go) paradigms?
 Starting with "Learn you a Haskell" seems good. But afterwards? I've seen books like "Production Haskell", interesting examples by James Carlson, frameworks like Mu, Servant, Legion, (although Haskellers seem to shun frameworks like Gophers). I'm looking for the most "different" or "paradigm shifting" option to get me out of my comfort zone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've noticed that Emacs seems to treat ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE as a word character. You can even see that if you do M-x describe-character:
  position: 4297 of 5814 (74%), column: 3 character: ﻿ (displayed as ﻿) (codepoint 65279, #o177377, #xfeff) charset: unicode (Unicode (ISO10646)) code point in charset: 0xFEFF script: arabic syntax: w which means: word to input: type "C-x 8 RET feff" or "C-x 8 RET ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" buffer code: #xEF #xBB #xBF file code: #xEF #xBB #xBF (encoded by coding system utf-8-unix) display: by this font (glyph code): mac-ct:-*-Arial-regular-normal-normal-*-13-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#xBD9) 
 Consequently, spell-checkers see words with a no-break space after them as being misspelled.
 Maybe related too: if I have something like ~foo~---bar in org-mode, foo is correctly fontified as code. But if I use an em-dash like ~foo~—bar then foo is not fontified correctly. Is there some way to tell org-mode that — should be treated like a dash?

  $ emacsclient --create-frame --alternate-editor='' emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server? emacsclient: To start the server in Emacs, type "M-x server-start". emacsclient: error starting emacs daemon  I also tried M-x server-start inside an emacs session, and it succeeds, but then emacsclient fails the same as above.
 However, this works:  % emacs --daemon ‘epa-file’ already enabled Starting Emacs daemon. Restarting server $ emacsclient --create-frame --alternate-editor='' Waiting for Emacs...  and it works great, and it lets me even remove (server-start). My question is: what is going on, and do I need to fix anything? I've found that I can even remove (server-start) from my init.el at that point and it still works. Also, what does the epa-file mean?
 The weird part is I can't even find the emacs --daemon when I use the ps -e command and I'm worried I have a few running around due to the server-start and not finding the socket.

 S-mouse-1 makes a selected region from the previous point to where I clicked
 Googling either suggests mouse-save-then-kill, which is not what I want or:
 (define-key global-map (kbd "<S-down-mouse-1>") 'ignore) ; turn off font dialog (define-key global-map (kbd "<S-mouse-1>") 'mouse-set-point) (put 'mouse-set-point 'CUA 'move) 
 which no longer works. I think the CUA property does not exist anymore, at least what this person found in cua-base.el is not there anymore.
 I've tried using mouse-set-region and mouse-drag-region but I cannot make it work (and I don't think they are intended for something like that).
 Maybe I should define a function that does set-mark (or cua-set-mark since I'm using CUA) at the point and then does mouse-set-point? Even if this is the answer I don't know how...
 What should I do?

 I am using emacs explicitly inside a terminal (-nw). Do you have any modeline packages that don't look terrible? I tried installing doom-modeline but there was no icon support (even after installing nerd-icons). Any suggestions are appreciated!
 Update: Figured it out. 1) As suggested by u/spudlgo I used use-package to install doom-modeline and run nerd-icons-install-font in emacs. This downloaded NFM.ttf in .local/share/fonts 2) Run fc-cashe -fv to update font cashe and then fc-list | grep .local/fonts . This makes a list of all the fonts in the directory. One needs to note down the name of desired font. 3) I opened dconf editor and searched for 'fonts' under terminal folder. The terminal profiles are going to pop up. I copied the name of the font I wanted to the 'font' bar. 4) change the terminal profiles and it's done.
 Note that the changes need to be done in the local machine. I tested it after using ssh to connect to the server and icons appear as intended.

 Does anybody have a script that uses id's for linking between two files and after id use an internal link.
 For example
  [[id:b7b07a14-5dbb-48ed-9d9d-70df49e83231:a heading][Heading]] 
 Here a heading won't work because its not supported method by default. 
 If anybody has a script that works on these type of links please share it with me.

I understand that as of Emacs 27, it's no longer used by default in favor of some built-in image manipulation routines. I also understand that historically ImageMagick has been prone to various security vulnerabilities which has been a headache for Emacs users and maintainers.
 I'm not worried about future security vulnerabilities, what I'm interested in is powerful functionality, which I know that ImageMagick is known for. For those of you who build your own Emacs binaries, do you build it with ImageMagick? What's your use-case and reasoning for doing so, or for not doing so?
 Interested in hearing any thoughts about ImageMagic in Emacs, legacy, history, the good, the bad, etc.
 Thanks!

 Does anyone know an elisp function that converts either HTML or shr-dom structure to a table.el table? I can probably try to write my own, but having to deal with all those spans makes me feel it'll be a bit tricky. I bet someone already solved that problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am on a mission to fully replace all my terminal/shell usage with shell-command.
 To that end, I wrote the package env-commander.el to help with setting up environments for shell commands. To quote the readme:
  
env-commander-mode is a simple mode which allows any shell commands that Emacs invokes to run one or more commands beforehand to initialize the shell environment. There are many Emacs packages which can configure process environments, for example, direnv, but they lack the ability to go a step further and define shell functions and aliases, which is often required by "virtual environment" tools. For those who prefer interacting with shell commands via shell-command rather than shell, eshell, or term, env-commander-mode is here to assist.
  
If you are a fellow shell-command enjoyer, you may also be interested in shell-command-x.el which I posted about recently.

Bindings: you can choose to have a dedicated keybindings (By default M-TAB or C-M-i on the common major modes) or set tab-always-indent to 'complete in order to make TAB have a double function: either complete or indent if there's nothing to complete.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 lately when I am coding I get annoyedd by the autocompletion popping up. Mostly it is just visual noise and it essentially does not interfere with typing, but combined with copilot it just becomes a noisy kindergarten. I was wondering if there are others out there with similar concerns and how you would tackle this ? 
 I have rebound my tab to company-completion for while, but I found it to be a bit uneven, for instance you´'d get nothing if no completion was found, making you doubt if it was working at all. Also, since then I have moved to vertico and from what I gather its completion trigger is organised differently and it also does not solve my copilot issue. 
 The reason for this post is that all info on completion is about automating all the tings and shower you with info while doing the dev, b/c we want to be vscode so much. 
 Instead I was looking for some inspiration regarding a different paradigm, an on-demand approach with the option to get more info on the class/function/type, or in the case of copilot, a snippet.
 thx.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using eglot + pylsp to edit Python files. Most of the time it works fine, but occasionally (frequently enough to be very annoying, but infrequently enough to be hard to reproduce!) it seems to get "out of sync", and I get a bunch of random errors that don't match the file I'm editing.
 For example, I'm currently editing a file that has no genuine errors or problems, but flymake-show-buffer-diagnostic reports 1 error ["unmatched ')'"] and 30 warnings (indentation errors, "unexpected spaces around keyword", etc.).
 Saving the file makes no difference.
 C-x C-v reloads the file and the errors disappear. Running eglot-reconnect also fixes the errors.
 eglots-events-buffer is a bit hard to interpret but it looks like at least some of the spurious errors are being received from pylsp.
 I don't know how to track down this problem as I don't know which component has the problem. Presuambly it's not flymake, but is Eglot sending the wrong file data? pylsp reporting the wrong thing? Some kind of JSON RPC issue? Something else I'm missing?
 Any tips on how to track down the issue?
 My eglot config is minimal:
 ```
 (use-package eglot
 :ensure t
 :defer t
 :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure)
 :bind (("C-c r" . eglot-rename)
 ("C-c C-r" . eglot-rename))) ```
 I'm running
 emacs 28.1 (same problem occurs with 29)

 I'm using emacs as a systemd service (as described in https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon#h5o-2), with the emacs.service file that comes with the emacs sources. All was working well in debian 11, but since I upgraded to the new stable the graphical emacsclient isn't able to connect to the daemon, I suspect because the daemon is started before gnome session. If I restart the systemd service it works, but not the first time I log in into gnome.
 I see that there is a solution to this (or similar) problem for KDE users in https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon#h5o-17 but my tentatives to replicate it for gnome were not succesful.
 Anyone knows how to fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I found good use in the EditGPT App which can helps tracking/editing changes. Basically, you instruct ChatGPT to "Proofread the following text" and can accept/decline the suggested changes. Any idea on how one could do this in Emacs? In particular, the part where the diff of two texts is created, and an interactive editing of the resulting changes is possible. The creation of the improved texts can simply be done using any of the LLM APIs.

 Everything is functioning properly except for when I attempt to open feeds in Elfeed; in that case, the following message is displayed:
 Elfeed: libxml2 functionality is unavailable 
 I tried rebuilding emacs but the --with-libxml2 or --with-libxml option is not recognized as a valid compilation flag. I also tried installing libmxl2 and libxml2-dev packages on my Debian system via APT but same issue.
 Do you have any idea which compilation flag I might have missed that could include the libxml2 library?

 I can't really explain the issue but will love any input. The problem is that eglot works but I have to constantly keep doing eglot-reconnect because somehow the session is lost. When I say constantly I mean like every minute (or less) when I'm in the middle of writing C++ code. I'm also using corfu (instead of company-mode), not sure if that changes anything.

 I want to create todos from roam notes. But since I do not want to add all my roam notes to the org-agenda, I refile my todos, which is alright so far.
 My capture template includes the mention of the original file and block where I was working as I created the todo, so I know from the agenda side where the todo comes from.
 But how shall I know from the roam note that a TODO has been created from there and what its state is (waiting, next...).
 Are there kind of backlinks for Todos in roam?

 I am using Spacemacs and I am struggling with a couple of things:
  
Perspectives. In theory, I should be able to open a new window (frame, I knwo) with a brand new perspective but I can't find the option for that. My Google-fu is failing me on this. If not, I am happy just being able to open a new blank perspective on the same Window and assigning it a shortcut. I can then use perspective switching to move between them.
 
I don't seem to be able to install multi-vterm. If I do package-install, it does not appear to be available. I like having multiple terminals and would like them all inside of Emacs. What am I missing? I am using the default config, with melpa enabled.

For the last three weeks I've done the tutorial and then read up some information on keybinds to try and info pages to read. While my muscle memory is improving, I still have the strong urge to use the trackpad to navigate. I don't do well with the control keybinds especially on my thinkpad laptop. I also often fat-finger the super key which throws me out of focus.
 Its terribly frustrating but I soldier on in the desire to reach nirvana. Please send me your emacs energy and any tips you have for training myself using a default emacs on either linux (fedora) or windows (11). I use them both on a daily basis.

Buck2 is a from-scratch rewrite of Buck, a
polyglot, monorepo build system that was developed and used at Meta (Facebook),
and shares a few similarities with Bazel.
As you may know, the Scalable Builds Group at Tweag
has a strong interest in such scalable build systems.
We were thrilled to have the opportunity to work with Meta on Buck2
to help make the tool useful and successful in the open-source use case.
We also have a strong focus and
a lot of experience with the Bazel build system.
To connect the two
I will give an overview of how Buck2 differs from Bazel.

 Emacs behaves perfectly well with full opacity, but flickers and produces static-like artifacts when transparency is enabled, especially when typing or scrolling. It seems less pronounced when the window emacs is stacked on top of is mostly a flat color. 
 I was using emacs-gcc-wayland-devel-bin 28.2. I tried building emacs-pgtk-native-comp-git 29.0 to no change. 
 So far, it is the only application with this issue. Oddly enough, this happens even with full opacity on Sway.

Until the next reboot. Now, I think, I prefer it this way. But it bothers me that after a reboot, the first task I have to do is attempt to open an encrypted file to trigger a prompt. I have two questions with all that:
  
Why does it now require the password and not store it between the reboots (as it used to)? I don't think this is Emacs doing. Probably some gpg.conf setting.
 
How can I initiate the prompt in Emacs without having to open an encrypted file?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi people, 
 I saw quite some versions of creating a Zettelkasten in Emacs using Org and one implementation of Building a Second Brain in Org. So, I would be really curious how one would merge both in org. I wrote an article on theory and practical method on how to combine those two methods: https://zettelkasten.de/posts/building-a-second-brain-and-zettelkasten/
 From experience, solutions in org ooze a great deal of creativity. So, if anyone wants to combine these methods, I will be happy to assist, in part to satisfy my curiosity.
 Live long and prosper Sascha

 clang-formatter provides a function for formatting the current buffer using clang-format. It's not a mode, but I limit modes to only languages that are supported by clang-format (C/C++/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Protobuf/C#). It also make it easy to customize formatting style from local variable (.dir-locals.el). 
 Some part of the code is inspired by gofmt function from go-mode.

Sometimes it works fine, but most of the time the scrolling of pdfs gets really slow. If I change the resolution to 1920x1200 it gets back to normal and scrolls smothly. When I use the builtin doc-view instead of pdf-tools it works fine. I tried running both on xorg and wayland and got the same result. Also, I tried running on a fresh emacs installation with the only package being pdf-tools, and the issue is still there. Does anybody experienced something similar? I am using emacs 27.1 on PopOS 22.04.

 When working with NodeJs on a machine with multiple cores you are forced to spawn multiple Node processes to utilize it. With Kube though, there is no reason to do so. Instead of giving a single process 8 cores you spawn 8 pods with cpu:1.
 My question is - how much of a reason do I have to give my cats-effect app 8 core vs spawning 8 instances?
 And also how much of a bottleneck is the process of serialization with cats services trying to do a lot of concurrent IO aka web servers? It's anecdotal since I was not there but at work, it was observed that NodeJs is dying very fast under the pressure of grpc encoding/decoding. But it seemed to me to be a mistaken judgment since it should be the same in cats/tokio/what-have-you so I think it was just easier for them to ramp up those core numbers with scala.

 💭 Why?
 I was never satisfied with any theme nor any fonts, some or the other time, always felt to have a change.
 For long duration I was settled on modus-vivendi only, other than that I liked cattpuccin and doom-gruvbox, the later two lacked some face highlights in some mode (info, eww.. ). But modus is obvious masterpiece.
 This is emacs, so obviously I want to modify if something bother me.
 As a result, I finally started making a theme that felt fine to me. (I say fine because, I don't think it is complete or perfect)
 📜 Info
 There is no science or principle behind this theme. Just some colors lying on your screen. If many of you do not like it, i might tweak and change some colors for community purpose. Or else, i might improve and add some goodies.
 Screenshots are here: https://github.com/idlip/haki/blob/haki/gallery.org
 As of now, I dont plan on making light theme, I'm not a light theme user. But if many want light variant, I might take it up in near future.
 ⭐ Features
  
Usually in themes, background of mark region, completion bar gets noticed. So i made haki-change-region, which changes region color in many places on the fly.
 There are variables like haki-*-font, which has respective use cases to look good in org, markdown, elfeed.
 Also for meow or evil users, you can use haki-modal-mode-line which changes the mode-line border color accordingly to states.
  
Too long, Don't wanna read;
  
https://github.com/idlip/haki.
 It is available in melpa!
 Screenshots => https://github.com/idlip/haki/blob/haki/gallery.org
  
As a side note, I manage my whole system (nixos) and emacs in literate org-mode and it has been great. Check here: https://github.com/idlip/d-nix

 It happens not infrequently midsession, that when I run dap-java-run-test-method, I am presented with a dap-server-log buffer, which says at the top:

 M-x lsp-restart-workspace or just M-x lsp have no effect on this. Short of restarting Emacs I can't get it working again. Does anyone have any advice?

I am always testing other pieces of software to improve my coaching, since not everybody uses The Archive. But whenever I start to use other apps, I am put off by their stutters and bugs. I think I report once every six months that something is off.
I started to use Apple Notes for collaboration (family stuff, with Christian, for a Podcast etc.). If I imagine that there are teams behind Apple Notes while Christian is 100% on its own, just with nagging me as a support, I am baffled.
In some way, I have the blessing to experience The Archive as a user with the most intimate user support possible. I have very high requirements for the software that I use to access my Zettelkasten because my work is very intense (after 6 hours of work I am often soaked in sweet). The software needs to get out of my way. The Archive is almost invisible to me now, almost like air. And similar to air, The Archive provides a vital foundation for me functioning.
So: Very good, @ctietze !]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Im basically using 2 versions of Emacs. 28 and 23, one on WIndows. The short story is that, the company Im working for uses Windows and a specific GIS software that ONLY can works with 23 (unless I do more research with the incredibly scant documentation on this unusual setup). Im okay with it so far, coz I havent dont any proper training, and Emacs isnt the main focus. And I managed to improve and learn a lot by doing some manual loading of eLisp files in Emacs 23.
 ​
 My main question, which fonts do you all prefer? Any arguments/reasons for it? Im using Julia Mono on the companies, and Source Code Pro on my personal setup. I find Source Code Pro to be more pleasant.
 Oh, one last thing, the Emacs on my Windows appears "less sharp/low res". Though it could just be a trick of the eye.

 These 4 comments could all have different faces.
 // Single line comment. /** Doxygen. */ /* disabled code. */ /* * Comment block. */ 
 I have some local configuration that can do this, but it seems like it could be made into a small package (possibly with string support too).
 e.g. 
 (setq my-custom-faces '((:type comment :match-literal "/**" :face font-lock-doc-face) (:type comment :match-regex "//[:blank:]" :face font-lock-doc-markup-face))) 
 Does something like this exist, or is it worth writing a new package?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The VC system in Emacs supports a bunch of version control systems including old ones like RCS and new ones like Git and Mercurial.
 Is it possible to write a package to add support for another version control system? At work I use a version control system that's not supported by VC.
 I've noticed that VC has emacs lisp code for each system ("vc-git.el", "vc-hg.el", "vc-cvs.el", and so on). Is all that's needed to write one of these? Or is there code in other parts (like vc.el) that is specific to the system. I notice that vc-src.el is very simple. So, I'm suspicious that there may be code in other places.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GPT-4 is completely confused and going in circles, I can't get a good explanation out of it.
 My situation is this: I was trying to define a sum type whose branches had some fields in common. Ultimately, this is what works:
 ```purescript type GraduatedFields r = ( graduatedMax :: Number , graduatedMin :: Number | r )
 type GridFields r = ( gridCellSize :: Size , gridOrigin :: Point | r )
 type HorizontalFields r = ( isOpposite :: Boolean | r )
 type CommonPanel a = { alignmentFocusName :: String , data :: Record () | a }
 data Panel r = Graduated (CommonPanel (GraduatedFields r)) | Grid (CommonPanel (GridFields r)) | Horizontal (CommonPanel (HorizontalFields r))
 ```
 But if I simply switch the () to {} (which I thought was the same thing) for GraduatedFields, for instance, this no longer compiles:
 ``` Could not match kind
 Type 
 with kind
 Row Type 
 while checking that type GraduatedFields r has kind Row Type while inferring the kind of CommonPanel (GraduatedFields r) in type constructor Panel ``` Why is this the case? What is the subtle difference between these two?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adding an update on my last post. 
 Since I announced consult-gh, we have now added some more features, including support for opening issues in magit/forge and create/edit posts from the forge buffer. This allows you to visit issues of any repo in an ad-hoc fashion and with an intuitive UI, eliminating the need to opening GitHub in a browser. 
 As mentioned in the last post, this can improve your GitHub workflow and now with forge integration will even make it more efficient and intuitive than before. Especially for repositories that you don't actively want to contribute to (so o cloning, no contribution, ...), this can simplify your magit/forge workflow.

 This week, I ran a poll on my Mastodon to see who uses Vanilla Keybindings vs Modal. As a Meow user since a year, I was curious. Given the results (hugely in favor of Vanilla), I decided to go back to trying Vanilla. And I'm really loving it. I feel like I'm actually faster in a way. It's hard to describe, but I prefer it over modal. Then again, I'm not a coder so I think maybe the reason that coders like modal is maybe it fits their typing/editing patterns better? I'm not sure.
 Anyway, as I said: I love Emacs and Vanilla keybindings. Except, as we all know, Emacs can be a bit of a relic. And sometimes, it's like the people in charge refuse to even acknowledge that the world has …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've been using org mode to store web bookmarks. I'd like to keep track of files using org mode, too.
 My goal is to have headlines to act as some sort of "abstraction" over my heterogeneous collection of bookmarks + local files. I can tag them, sort them, reference them (through ids), annotate them in the same way (despite web bookmarks and local files being so different).
 The idea is to just use attachments: attachments do use the usual ID property, the data dir is global (~/data). Inheritance for attachment is off for the sake of simplicity and to avoid problems when refiling.
 Whenever I want to index a file I just use org capture, i specify a file path (or file on point if using dired) and it automatically creates creates a headline with the file attached (moved) in it. 
 The only difficulty i see so far is to make org attach a file during a capture. It looks feasible, though.
 Does anyone here a similar workflow? I'd like to read advices or some experiences in this regard

 Some hacky methods I've seen involved a keybinding bound to a chain of resizing keystrokes. I wondered if there is a better way of achieving the same thing. Like how when you use tmm-menubar, when it opens, it doesn't do a 50/50 split but instead was more like 70/30 (I'll leave a picture in the comments for reference).

 How would you approach this? I don't want to assign unsafe runs to buttons, there must be a better way to create a ZIO which deploys the GUI in the end.

 I tried running an app in Windows's Program Files with M-x term and basically I can't figure out how to do the autocomplete for the space.
 I tried escaping it with '\' and just inputting it as is ' ' but neither seems to work.
 There must be a trivial solution for this.

 emacs-groundup
 Hi,
 Announcing v0.2 of emacs-groundup! There have been a number of exciting changes since v0.1.0. First, a quick recap of the objectives:
  
Provide a solid, ootb workflow for task and project management.
 Pre-configured for Julia and python programming.
 Can be used as-is by setting only a handful of (including zero) parameters. Ideal for users looking to 'try emacs'.
 Provide a carefully crafted set of keybindings using evil (pure emacs experience also possible).
  
Finally, here are some new features available in v0.2:
  
Module-based architecture, providing an excellent springboard for writing your own modules or tweaking existing ones.
 A project-based programming workflow using emacs-native tab- and project-management tools.
 LSP using the now built-in eglot.jl
  
And many, many more. A detailed CHANGELOG (v0.2 ← v0.1) available here.
 Give it a go! All user feedback and contributions are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello tout le monde,
 I (quite) recently wrote an extension (called by the name "Aby") for our beloved Emacs which is capable of dynamically handle (code/text/you name it…) snippets within your buffers. *Aby* is extensible via Elisp and thus pretty versatile. I'd be glad if you'd find some use in this work. A minor package-version is pending, but -- as of now -- Aby is working fine under the current circumstances. The (ROBOdoc) code documentation will give you some more insight on how it works: https://code.rubenphilipp.com/aby/
 Here you'll find the repository: https://github.com/rubenphilipp/aby

The "interactively sort" part is critical because I don’t want to recreate the list of candidates, as often that would require re-calling the original command that brought up the minibuffer in order to get the right candidates.
 I know you can customize consult--read to sort the originally displayed candidates, but what about changing the sort of the already-displayed candidates? Might embark-become offer a solution?
 Thanks so much for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 Khoj has added a bunch of features since my first announcement, so thought of sharing updates here in case you folks want to try it out and give feedback.
 Demo
 Uses Khoj to Search, Chat with the Khoj Github repository from Emacs
 Feature updates
  
Unified Search: Fast search across all (text) content types from a single interface
 Simplified setup 
 Installing Khoj on Emacs will automatically install the server if you have python, pip installed
 Khoj now works with python 3.11. So search is 25% faster and works with the default installed python on most operating systems
 We've started onboarding folks to Khoj cloud. Get on the invite list if you're interested in using Khoj AI on your phone and other devices (or don't want to self-host Khoj)
 
 You can quickly test out Khoj on the FAQ page. It'll let you search and chat with the Khoj Github repository 
 Khoj can now index issues, commit messages and docs from any Github repository
 
  
Quickstart
 Install Khoj from MELPA and call M-x khoj to run it
 See khoj.el setup instructions for more details or just ask Khoj on the FAQ webpage

 Dirvish with media-progress-dirvish package
 media-progress-dirvish and media-progress-dired packages displays position where you stopped watching video file in emacs's file manager buffer. Under the hood it extracts this data from media player (currently mpv only, but I suppose vlc support is also possible). Both packages available on MELPA. Hope this package will be useful for community! Any feedback highly appreciated!

 Lspce is a simple lsp client for Emacs, it only supports a small set of LSP features ( and I don't want to add more ATM), but for the last year, it was my main lsp client and it worked well, so maybe it's useful for others too.
 The highest priority of it is not to freeze Emacs, I cannot say I have achieved this goal, but I think it's in a good shape in terms of this.
 It's implemented as a module with Rust. It takes advantages of threads and caches results from lsp server to reduce Emacs's burdens.
 Its code ( especially the elisp code) needs some more improvements, and bugs are expected. You're warned :)
 You can find more details in the README. Enjoy it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do (Scala 3) trait parameters interact with parameters of classes that extend the trait?
 I thought I wanted to write something like this:  trait ExampleTrait(val param: Int) case class Class(override val param: Int) extends ExampleTrait(param) val x = (Class(1): ExampleTrait).param  However, the compiler rejects the class line, saying:  ... error overriding value param in trait ExampleTrait of type Int; value param of type Int cannot override val parameter value param in trait ExampleTrait 
 I'm not clear on why that "value param of type Int cannot override val parameter value param in trait ExampleTrait".
 I tried several variations (e.g., no var on trait parameter, no override on class parameter, no val on class parameter), but nothing I tried that still had the trait parameter and had a class parameter with the same name worked. (Using different parameter names worked, but they're logically the same thing, so I want to keep the names identical.)
 Of course, I can do it without trait parameters, as in:  trait ExampleTrait { def param: Int } case class Class(override val param: Int) extends ExampleTrait val x = (Class(1): ExampleTrait).param 
 However, I thought maybe that would be doable using trait parameters.
 (No, it's not essential that I use a trait parameter. However, I'm also trying to learn Scala 3, so I'd like to understand what's going on and what the rules are, and whether trying use a trait parameter makes sense for my use case.)
 Thanks.

 I've written a simple package to help me install packages. Maybe you'll like it too. So I make this post. 
 I copy some description from the README ( read README in the repo for more details)
 Introduction
 Pie is a very simple Package Installer for Emacs.
 I used to use package.el
 (and elpa/melpa etc.), but it has some drawbacks IMO, including:
  
A single repository may be split into several packages. Some people like it, but not including me.
 It does not support optional dependencies.
  
I’ve only tested/used it on Linux, maybe there are some problems on Windows and/or Mac.
 Features
 Pie supports the following features:
  
Support cloning a repository or downloading files (e.g. from emacswiki) directly.
 Support cloning a particular branch/tag/commit
 Support git’s shadow clone
 Support customized building logic
 Support specifying dependencies according to your actual needs
 Support generating autoloads files and loading it

 There are many long-time users here who've been using Emacs for many years. In all these years, how well do you think Emacs has evolved? Are there some things that you think Emacs did very well in these years? Are there areas where Emacs did not do so well?

 Hello /r/emacs,
 shell-command-x.el is a package I wrote to improve the experience of using shell-command and async-shell-command without straying too far from the behavior of vanilla Emacs. Its primary features are:
  
The names of process buffers can be customized on a per-command basis; for example, the buffer name for the command ls -la can be automatically set to *shell:ls*, *shell:ls -la*, or any other number of desired values.
 
When a command completes, its output buffer can emulate special-mode; this is useful for quickly dismissing (with quit-window) or quickly re-running the command (with revert-buffer).
 
When a command completes, the point can be moved to the beginning of the output buffer if the command wasn't interactive; this is useful for paging through the output of commands like grep --help.
 
 The project readme also contains some tips and tricks for a smoother experience. The goal of the package is essentially to make shell buffers display when and where you want them, depending on the kinds of commands you run, and for those buffers to behave more like native special emacs buffers like help-mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my post isn't meant to bash on Magit, but rather I am trying to understand what kind of issues people had with the git CLI that made them love Magit. 
 I remember before entering the world of emacs, people would say the two packages that would change your life would be Magit and org-mode. I have been using emacs for a few months now and I can safely say that I never use org-mode and still use the git CLI as I find it faster. Really the package that I felt was unique and made me stick with emacs was Tramp. The ability to open a remote file in an instant, with no subscription fee (looking at you Jetbrains) and without it interfering with my workflow was amazing.
 Now I am a young adult (~26yr) and am still early in my career as a software engineer so maybe I am just ignorant, but really the only git commands I use are git diff, status, pull, push branch and merge. And honestly in my bubble of using git, Magit is not really that much different than just using the CLI. Heck in the terminal I can even create aliases and chain commands with && which is even faster.
 Are there git commands that I don't know about that feel horrible or are the projects and responsibilities I deal with still small enough that I do not see the downfalls of using the CLI for much larger projects?
 TLDR: What aspects of Magit make it a better experience for version control than just using git in the terminal?
 EDIT: I want to thank each and everyone that replied. It seems that the way I commit code (multiple files at a time) is super elementary and for better debugging and readability people actually commit specific LINES of code not even files, which Magit in unmatched for. I learned a lot of new tools in this post specifically ediff and git bisect which I had not heard off. I plan to take these lessons forward in my career. I apologize if was not able to reply to everyone but I do promise I read your message. Thanks again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I'm trying to get a maybe unusual configuration work with eglot + clangd + projectile (or maybe project.el, any would be fine really)
 My projects are organized roughly like this:
 common project_a/.projectile project_b/.projectile project_c/.projectile 
 All dirs are git repos and common is shared between the three projects. Inside the .projectile files there is a +/../common line to include the common dir when looking for project files.
 The three project dirs include a compile_commands.json that also knows how to compile files in the common dir.
 Each project may set different defines or compiler flags to compile common code.
 Now I have two problems:
 - if I open a file inside project_a and then try to open a file in common with C-p f it switches to a new project root and from now on common is a project on its own (probably because it detects a git repo?)
 - if I jump to a symbol inside project_a defined in common, new project root again, clangd looks for compile_commands.json inside it, doesn't find it and fails to resolve symbols.
 I want each project to behave like a single one including common dir both in project navigation and in clangd.
 Any idea? Should I may be disable git project detection in some way?
 Thanks!

 A sample line looks like this:
  
0007600 *words words words $7.20 12/27/21
  
If I just highlight and convert to table, it doesn't recognize the "words" part and I have too many columns. For example:
  
| 0007600 | *words | words | words | $7.20 | 12/27/21 |
  
I have a way to use M-x replace-string to add a "|" before every "$" or the date and even at the beginning of each line (the last step).
 Question:
 I need to find a way to insert a "|" after the initial numbers. I have tried replace-regexp with "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]", but I cannot find a way to add the "|" after those.
 Is there an easy way to insert a "|" in the 8th position, or after a set of numbers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I decided to integrate some GoJS code into a PureScript Halogen application. I have some funding to do this, so it's not just a hobbyist project (though it started that way).
 Creating the Halogen components would be simple enough if one takes inspiration from gojs-react. The issue is that there are no PureScript bindings for the GoJS types themselves, but GoJS does provide .ts.d declarations, which means I could use purescript-read-dts, but that library's maturity/usability seems somewhat ambiguous, according to an author's post from 3 years ago.
 Conceptually I'm thinking of generating the bindings, trying to call the code from just PureScript, and adjusting the bindings manually for implicitly effectful computations. I'm not an experienced PureScript (or Javascript really) developer so I'm wondering what the community thinks of such a project. I know it's big.

 Instead, I’d like some suggestions for VB macros to help me send outlook message links to org-mode. I have org-outlook and a VB macro that copied the link to the message, but here’s what I’d like: a single macro that copies the message link, subject, body, etc., focuses emacs, calls org-capture, then archives the message in Outlook. 
 I just don’t know VB well enough to know where to begin. Anyone have other workflows they have developed to work with Outlook?

I used The Archive for a long time. Since then I've progressed through org-mode, obsidian, and any number of other weird tools for my linked writing. At the moment, I'm mostly using neovim with Renee's (remember Renee? He's still around!) Telekasten plug-in (check it out if you're using neovim).
Anyway, on a whim, I opened The Archive tonight to see how it would deal with the bizarre mess that my zettelkasten is. It works, flawlessly. The only issue is that I had to abandon putting things into subdirectories, which is something that I had been considering doing anyway. So, I did that, and, just in playing around, I got more actual useful connected thinking done tonight than I have in a long, long time.
Much love to Christian and Sascha, again.

On the 9th of March in the year 2023 or our era, Topiary was born or, at
least, its version 0.1.0 was released. Thus began the quest to package it, to
make it available in various ecosystems. Topiary is a universal formatter engine
written in Rust and packaged with Cargo. Packaging it in nixpkgs was a breeze
because of nixpkgs’ support for Rust, but mostly because someone else did it for us, for which we have to thank our contributor figsoda. It is
therefore already possible to do:
$ echo '{"foo"  : "bar"   }' | nix run nixpkgs#topiary -- -l json
{ "foo": "bar" }

Great.
Now, Topiary comes with support for OCaml and we want to be able to reach
this community and make it easy for them to use Topiary in their projects.

Does anyone know of a way to get org elements in a file that match some tags/props matcher progammatically (or even just match on a regex), or tell whether those elements exist so that I can use them as a function on org-blocker-hook? I tried e.g. org-tags-view as well as org-occur-in-agenda-files, but it seems like both of those just open a buffer with the appropriate lines and return nil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Even before trying out emacs in a more decisive way I had read about emacs pinky and had remapped my caps lock to left ctrl and vice versa and I was awed by how much more sense it makes. (Funny thing is my brother who is not a software engineer made fun of me for switching with the argument that the whole world uses it as is.)
 Now I am finally getting more comfortable in emacs I am trying to figure out whether I should remap the M key somewhere more comfortable.
 In typical keyboards and laptops M is in the left Alt position and therefore feels a bit uncomfortable to type M-x since I strike M with my left thumb and x with either the pointer or the middle finger.
 Is it my left thumb that is useless or does it feel more natural to hit M with the right thumb in the right Alt or AltGr? Currently my right (dominant) thumb feels more flexible and even though I know I will probably get used to it soon, I wonder if there are any clear cut better places for it. What do you guys prefer?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just found this nice minor mode for org.
 One thing I'm not quite satisfied is that the indentation for the plain text under deep levels is too much. For example, there are like 5 spaces difference between the heading and the text at level 5. 
 I think this behavior is controlled by the internal variable org-indent--text-line-prefixes, which specifies 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, .... In the mean time, the org-indent--heading-line-prefixes is like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.... This is weird to me, as I would think the indentation for the text should be a constant offset relative to the heading. 
 Does anyone know how to fix this? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have lsp-java mostly working. About 80% of the time, when I expect a completion menu to appear, I get one after a few seconds. When I don't, reloading the buffer often fixes the problem.
 More concerningly, emacs will occasionally lock up for a minute or more. If I send a USR2 signal to emacs, that appears to inject a Quit command and create a backtrace. That, or that with several C-gs, will usually get me back to a point where I can issue command and enter text. That stack traces usually have lsp-process-send near the top. 
 These tend to happen when I try to save a file or wait for a completion menu. (I am using company for completions.)
 At times, the lsp server (jdtls) will start using 8-9 CPUs for several minutes. 
 I'm assuming this is not normal behavior. :-) Are there things that I can look at to try to understand what is going wrong?

 b) should I convince direnv to not unload upon visiting these files?
 c) should I tell LSP mode to not try to reconfigure upon visiting dependencies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago I posted about how I was changing light and dark themes in Emacs. I wanted to provide an update, as it has changed a bit. 
 I am now using the top-right menu on Gnome to enable and disable dark mode. However, old GTK3 applications do not "see" this setting at all.
 To solve this problem I am using:
  
Python script that monitors dbus and changes the GTK theme when selecting dark
 Systemd unit to ensure the script is running all time
 Emacs snippet to react to this change
  
With this setup, having Emacs complied with pure GTK, changing the dark mode on gnome triggers a theme change, while the script triggers a change on the frame decoration. It sounds hacky, but the transition is very smooth and seamless.
 Also, this new code, makes sure that only one theme is configured in Emacs, as having multiple themes selected might be problematic, if themes change different settings.
 (use-package dbus :init (defun theme-switcher (value) ;; 0 = No Preference ;; 1 = Prefers dark ;; 2 = Prefers light. Not currently used by Gnome (let* ((dark-theme 'ef-dark) (light-theme 'ef-frost) (new-theme (if (= value 1) dark-theme light-theme)) (switch? (not (member new-theme custom-enabled-themes)))) (when switch? (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes) (load-theme new-theme)))) (defun handler (value) (theme-switcher (car (car value)))) (defun signal-handler (namespace key value) (if (and (string-equal namespace "org.freedesktop.appearance") (string-equal key "color-scheme")) (theme-switcher (car value)))) :config (dbus-call-method-asynchronously :session "org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop" "/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop" "org.freedesktop.portal.Settings" "Read" #'handler "org.freedesktop.appearance" "color-scheme") (dbus-register-signal :session "org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop" "/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop" "org.freedesktop.portal.Settings" "SettingChanged" #'signal-handler))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been using Neovim as my "ide", like to switch to Emacs.
 Neovim pros:
  
Very fast workflow
 well chosen keybindings
 great Project overview
 works in Terminal
 Tabs ❤️
  
Cons: - lack of features (no standardized) - many plugins unstable - sometimes freezes - not all plugins Crossplatform
 Emacs Pros:
  
Lots of features for development and more
 Lisp better than lua or vimscript
 GUI and Terminal
 Org-mode, Magit, ...
 self documentation, file opening, ...
  
Cons: - Bad default movement - complicated Keybindings general
 Some things that are important to me. Biggest thing holding me off from switching are the Keybindings. Just Moving the cursor is already such a strech. I've installed Evil mode but you have to configure it with every other plugin and often end up with doubled behaviour and not everything working as expected. It's still very hacky and i'm not sute if i should be using it.
 My Question is if i should just commit to the default binding? I've heard that they are subjectively bad and cause pinky strain and don't allow a fast workflow, and i can see that being the case. But maybe it just comes down to practice.
 Any of you had the same experience coming from Vim? Who uses the default bindings? Do you experience any problems with them?
 Thank you in advance!

Is there any way to get this type of functionality within The Archive?
If not, is there an external editor that would be good for this?

 (If anyone is able to help me with the pdf-tools installation, I would be immensely grateful! I have tried downloading XQuartz, poppler and automake and set up my init file as per this answer, but I'm still getting the error that symbol is not found in ARM64 architecture)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs experts, I need your help. I run Emacs in text mode in 16-colour terminal emulator. I recently upgraded from Emacs 27 (shipped with Debian 11) to 28 (shipped with Debian 12) and all the colours got horribly messed up. Here is an example from customize-face:
 https://i.imgur.com/KdaaC2J.png
 I speculate this happens because the default colours now assume 256-colour terminal, and indeed if I switch to 256 colours in the terminal emulator the settings look readable:
 https://i.imgur.com/dE2jUCv.png
 The question is how do I easily revert to earlier settings from Emacs 27? I could possible go through all the options and set font faces to desired values, but this will be an extremely tedious task given the amount of options, and I feel like there must be a simple solution for this.
 EDIT: It seems that the problem with colours only happens when running Emacs from inside Tmux, but not when running it directly from a terminal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, When I try to create my daily note with org-roam-dailies-goto-today , the note (title and name) takes yesterday's date. The calendar shows the right day for today (if I want to select another date), so it knows today's date. But the function goto-today / capture-today is wrong.
 My capture template for the dailies is the default one. And org-roam-dailies-goto-tomorrow also captures yesterday's date. Where shall I place the edebug() command to get more feedback from emacs regarding these functions?
 I am using emacs 28.2 on Windows, with org-roam v2.2.2-42
 Any idea? Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently (as in right now) designing a short (first iteration 5 hours of structured lecturing in total 2 open consulting hours) workshop that is directly geared towards beginners or people who make sure that they nailed the basics.
There are 8 open slots per workshops. A workshop means that you don't have to compete for time or attention as if you are in an underfunded public school. So, I decided 8 is a reasonable size. So, it is rather limited.
It is a no-fluff-concept. I won't tell you about the history of the method or my backstory. There are no complicated workflow terms you'll need to learn or note typology (which is only clouding the applicable knowledge). It is 5 hours of intense learning to get you started (most likely divided in 3 sessions with 2 additional open consulting hours).
Cost: 250-300$ for the whole workshop.
There will be an official announcement. If you are interested, subscribe to the newsletter, send me a daily carrier pigeon and ask how it is going, check the page hourly or use your preferred method of keeping updated.
I am happy to answer any questions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, I wrote up an idea of mine here which some very wonderful person (Karthink) made for me!
 He even gave it a wonderful name: Dired-Delight
 (No, I'm not renaming it to Dired-Summer, guys 😛)
 Anyway, I thought some of you might want to check it out. Uses would include (for me):
 1) Sorting through lots of files and directories and marking them with colors to say if they're processed, or still processing.
 2) Coloring files differently that belong to different categories but you need to keep them in the same folder.
 3) You have a folder with lots of pictures from different decades/eras and you want to visually mark them off.
 Etc...
 Plus it kinda looks pretty.
 Karthink says he wants to give it to me and I'll be the maintainer but, as I really have zero experience doing that, I may hold off on that for now. I am learning elisp right now but it's slow-going. I'm doing my best tho. It's just got nothing to do with my job so it's sometimes hard to find the time for a few hours to get through more lessons. But I'll get there. 🙃

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Org mode is incredibly flexible, and I particular I've recently turned my attention into the customizable regexp, they're all named something like org-*-regexp: 
  
org-emphasis-regexp-components
 org-outline-regexp 
  
My question is if they could be modified so that org-mode becomes a sort of markdown, for example replacing the stars '*' with hashtags '#' and the like, and if so, how much it would break (I'd assume pretty much everything as I'm using Doom emacs which has a lot of packages I'm not aware of). For example org-ql has also defined a similar set of variables named org-ql-*regexp (although I've not checked if it's a one-to-one correspondence between org regexp and org-ql regexp but is seems promising)
 Also I sort of remember that org-mode was moving away from parsing files using regular expressions in the long term, so even if today was more or less possible, then with each passing year, support for regular expression tweaking would be smaller.
 To what extent is this possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many packages like org-krita/org-yt/org-excalidraw/org-xournalpp allow custom files to be displayed inline by means of a custom link type. However, they don't work when the file is linked as an attachment, which makes me think that there may be a better way to achieve this. 
 ​
 The org-display-inline-images function uses some functions and variables from image.el such as image-file-name-regexp and create-image to respectively check if the file is an image and to create the image descriptor to display it inline.
 The packages above (except org-yt which is more general) kind of work the same way: there is a project binary file (e.g. .xopp) that gets converted to an image format such as .png and .svg and then it gets displayed inline.
 Would it be possible to define a custom image handler (e.g. for .xopp) that would work exactly the same as, let's say, .png, except that it performs a conversion (.xpp -> .png) before actually handling it? And then the second questions: would it be a silly idea?

 I'm trying to convert from using an Option of some (concrete) type T to using a union type that "unions" a type representing being empty with that original type T. (See OldCellState vs. NewCellState in the code below.)
 Specifically, I'm trying to convert the logic at the line labeled with "#1" (a for-comprehension generator(?) that limits processing to only non-empty cells and gets the ball color in a variable for further use).
 What the right/normal/usual way to convert that for a union type?
 My conversion attempt at the line labeled "#2" fails compilation with the error message "value withFilter is not a member of Example.NewCellState". I partially understand that desu…]]></summary>

I'm on a Mac and I almost never use the Finder anymore to sort through files and manage them because dired is so amazing. But, here's a suggestion for a package (and please let me know if one already exists that does this):
 I want to colorize files/directories to visually group them. And I'll explain:
 In MacOS, you can select files and folders and click on File at the top menu and get a selection of colors which you have defined. They are essentially tags and you can add multiple colors to files/folders this way and also define them however you want. You can also search for them in this way. Tagging files and folders will put a colored dot next to their icon or next to their name in the Icon view. My idea for this package would be:

Things work without a problem until I use MS Teams for a video call (using an external webcam). Once I've done that, every time I return to Emacs I get multiple errors saying 
 <XF86WebCam> is undefined 
 When I press a key the error goes away and I can use Emacs as usual but if I move to another application and then back to Emacs the error messages return again. I'm not using any packages that I know of that require a webcam. This behaviour only seems to have started since the recent .7 update to Emacs and happens using both Wayland and X11. I can't seem to replicate the problem on my laptop that has a built-in webcam. I'd be very grateful if anyone could provide some ideas as to what's going on or how to identify the problem. Thanks!

 I ran the ./configure command with native compilation and pgtk3 options and it seemed to run fine.
 When I run make, I get an error and it fails. I don't know much about C (or elisp for that matter) but as far as I can tell, the crux of the error message is this:
 ​
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (void-function seq-some) make[2]: *** [Makefile:916: bootstrap-emacs.pdmp] Error 255 make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/me/computing/emacs/src' make[1]: *** [Makefile:544: src] Error 2 
 ​
 Does anyone know what is going wrong?
 ​
 I have also tried to build and install aur packages for emacs 29 using an aur helper and run into a similar error.
 ​
 Thanks.

 PS. sorry if this is lacking information, i am not very experienced with this process.

Contretemps with a local tax appraisal agency inspires me to track their activities. I want to take notes and link to appropriate statutes.
When the statutes are updated, I want to replace the old copies with the new. Like anyone both wanting and eating cake, I'd like for my links to survive the file replacement.
I can link to a document. I can link to a document name, and that solves the problem if the document name remains constant over revision.
What I would really like is a link to "all files containing Texas Unemployment Compensation" and "201.011".
Right now, I'm using Devonthink. I can save a search as a smart group and then link to the smart group, but that's quite a bit of friction for creating a link. I think it also may not fit intimately with Devonthink's AI based See Also feature.
Any thoughts appreciated. I also appreciate the hospitality here.  The discussion is wonderful.]]></summary>

 I have `outline-minor-0` wich has some attributes applied. I don't care which attributes are applied on the face, I just want it to have a *red* foreground. So i write the following line in my init file:
 (set-face-attribute 'outline-minor-0 nil :foreground "red")
 However, the truth is that `outline-minor-0` has already applied these attributes: `:background "light grey" :weight 'bold`. The 3 attributes get mixed together so the resulting attributes of `outline-minor-0` are: red foreground, light grey background, bold weight when I just wanted a red foreground! 
 ​
 I could specify `:background 'undefined :weight 'undefined` to remove those attributes, but I'd like to implicitly reset every other unspecified attribute. How can I do it?

Any help or clarification would be much appreciated, or if one could point me in a good direction or to a resource that would be great too.

 You guy must have a working config for Emacs lsp-mode for typescript major mode.
 Seems my config keeps producing an error : "The connected server does not support method textDocument/declaration...use M-x lsp-describe-session"
 M-x lsp-describe-session --> produces an empty buffer...so no values there.
 Tried few config tricks but none seems to work, and C-c l does not work either:
 (use-package lsp-mode
 :commands (lsp lsp-deferred)
 :init
 (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l") ;; Or 'C-l', 's-l'
 :config
 (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t))
 ​
 (use-package typescript-mode
 :mode "\\.ts\\'"
 :hook (typescript-mode . lsp-deferred)
 :config
 (setq typescript-indent-level 2))
 ​
 Any help is greatly appreciated.
 Thank you

 I would like to do some own little projects in scala to get deeper into it and exercise before the exams.
 I've my setup in IntelliJ and I am using sbt.
 So far the issue I am having is I do not get how to manage dependancies correctly.

I presume that single cards will be sufficient for my notes in most cases, and if I need some more space I can always make a "double" note by using two cards (or even more).
What do you think? What size are your cards?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Doom Emacs for the past 5 years, and I'm ashamed to say I don't really know Emacs. Today I came across meow and wanted to try it out; I commented out my .emacs.d folder and started from scratch.
 Simple things like the M-x popup isn't actually stock. In Doom, it's provided by a package called vertico. Then other packages provide fuzzy matching in vertico.
 To get out from M-x I had to press Escape 3 times. And this is without bringing up how unintuitive the keybindings are (like moving around).
 Emacs could do with much needed polish. Without Doom Emacs (and its configuration) and the amazing packages people provide, I don't think I could use Emacs.
 It's no wonder Emacs isn't really brought up in conversation. I would like to see improvements in usability. It needs built-in quality-of-life improvements to be more accessible to people. Emacs being extremely powerful and extensible means nothing if the average person isn't able to use that to their benefit.
 I hope I didn't come across as too criticising; I do love Emacs and spend most of my day in it. Thanks

 I would like to use the siunitx latex package. 
 I installed the package doing:
 sudo apt -y install texlive-science
 When I compile my document using directly latex:
 pdflatex mydoc.tex
 it works, but when I'm within emacs, the latex-preview-pane package cannot compile my document.
 I guess I have to tell emacs and auctex where to find the packages I installed when I installed texlive-science. 
 How can I solve this ?
 PS : I know that the error in latex-preview-pane comes from the \usepackage[siunitx], because if I comment this line, it works perfectly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
 Functional applications offer numerous benefits in modern software development. They enhance testability, modularity, and composability, leading to more maintainable and scalable codebases. In this article, we'll explore the syntax and semantics of functional applications and introduce the app-toolkit library—a powerful tool for building functional applications more efficiently.
 Syntax and Semantic of an App
 At its core, an app can be represented as a function that takes an input (I) and produces an output (O). By incorporating side effects, we extend this representation to I => F[O], where F[_] denotes the ability to handle side effects.
 Resources
 To build an app, we rely on resources such as app information, input arguments, a logger, and configuration settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After struggling for years to manage my personal finances, found ledger/hledger. My goal is to find my yearly expense so that I can make FIRE plan. Ledger is great, but required to create transactions in ledger. Struggled with parsing bank/card pdfs, manually creating entries and nothing worked. Eventually realized that I can just copy the text from pdf into emacs and then format it using emacs macros. Then next task was to convert the transaction lines into ledger entries. This gave birth to `ob-ledger-convert` or `ob-lc` to provide `lc` src blocks in the org mode which when executed convert the given transactions into ledger format. It does need parsers and I have provided some of the parsers used by me in the `ob-lc` module. New parsers can be added easily.
 This post is to share the enthusiasm of the emacs being such a fascinating machine which lets you do anything you want and also to get the feedback from the community on the package.
 The sample org file provided in the repo provides a gist of how to use the module.

recently, which cuts down the maintenance cost to use LH

 maccalfw
 This is a project born by personal need and mostly for personal use and very much still work in progress, so use at your own discretion. I am still testing it as I had to customize large parts of calfw and calfw-blocks to my liking (working on the interface for modifying and adding events now).
 Bug reports and possible improvements are welcome.
 ​
 A bit of background: I was trying to find ways to view and modify my calendars from within Emacs which lead me down the rabbit hole of figuring out calendar clients for my Google Calendar, my Apple calendar and my work Office365 calendar. Clients for Office365 are particularly annoying with the new Oauth2 system; an app has to be trusted by Microsoft which pretty much means that all open source clients are unusable unless one has admin control over the Azure environment.
 After some pointless struggle, I decided to just rely on my local MacOS calendar app to handle all the authentication and to sync my calendars. I wrote a simple interface in Swift which can be imported in Emacs and then used to feed events into calfw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just as the title says, Scala's community looks very pessimistic on how the language is progressing on the basis of what I read here and from say blog posts.
 Context is that I'm an AI engineer in R&D. Currently I do just about everything in Python, SQL with a sprinkle of R. I know some Scala 2, Java and C++ as well. To me, Scala always felt like the ideal marriage of having a great type system and not having the annoying things you'd associate from static typing.
 I think the pessimism hurts adoption as folk like myself become skeptical. That's sad because at least in theory the language does exactly what people like me need: a pragmatic yet principled way to make software. Scala 3, especially, looks flexible enough for scripting and interactive stuff with for example polynote. Type safety also reduces the footguns compared to Python.
 It won't deter me, I'll keep on going but at the very least I wanted to share my thoughts.

 My goal is to take a single buffer and divide it into multiple regions, so that, for example, the top half could display a calendar (I use calfw, so I had intended to show the one week view here) and the bottom half could be divided into left and right.

It causes some calendar clients to read them incorrectly by scheduling todo headings with current time or showing scheduled events in a todo list.
 I wrote a systemd .service file (with a bit of help) to switch all scheduled todo headings as VEVENTS and unscheduled as VTODOs. From initial tests it seems to be working correctly on Thunderbird and calcurse.
 It works by checking if an entry in the .ics file uses current time for DTSTART (that's what icalendar assigns to unscheduled todo headings). If it does then it should be a VTODO, otherwise a VEVENT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does the Refined library for Scala (at https://github.com/fthomas/refined; "eu.timepit" %% "refined") work in Scala 3? Does it work differently?
 I'm having trouble in migrating some code that uses Refined from Scala 2 to Scala 3.
 The code is:
 import eu.timepit.refined.api.{Refined, RefinedTypeOps}
 import eu.timepit.refined.numeric.Interval.Closed
 object Example {
 type MyType = Int Refined Closed[1, 3]
 object MyType extends RefinedTypeOps.Numeric[MyType, Int]
 val good: MyType = MyType(1) // 2.13: works
 val bad: MyType = MyType(42) // 2.13: correctly fails with error re 42 > 3
 }
 It works fine with Scala 2.13.11 (with dependency "eu.timepit" %% "refined" % "0.11.0"), compiling per the comments.
 However, with Scala 3 (I tried 3.0.0, 3.3.0) the line with good fails compilation with the error "object MyType in object Example does not take parameters".
 It looks like an apply method implemented using RefineMacro.implApplyRef disappeared for the Scala 3 version of eu.timepit.refined.api.RefinedTypeOps. 
 Does the Scala 3 version still support compile-time validation of literal values to refined types? 
 If so, how? (That is, what do I change "MyType(1)" to in order to have it work in Scala 3?)
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been really frustrated lately, trying to get black text on white background. I want to I use my e-ink tablet as an external screen when programming out in the sunshine. But it has turned out that something as simple as a high contrast theme with a pure white background and black text is beyond my abilities. 
 For some reason, M-x set-background-color white sets the background to gray when running emacs in a terminal. Even setting the background color to #ffffff results in a gray background (and in me shouting frustrated at the monitor). I can get pure white with xemacs, but I'm mostly working on our development servers remotely over slow ssh connections, so xemacs is out of the equation. 
 Of the standard themes, whiteboard comes closest, but is also gray background, smudged and hard to read on e-ink. Literally every light theme I've downloaded has been some variant of smudgy yellow, gray or teal for the background. Grayish text on grayish background is virtually illegible on e-ink. 
 I found an "e-ink" theme here: https://emacsthemes.com/themes/eink-theme.html. This gets me black text on a white background... mixed with white text on a white background (#includes and other syntax highlighting), so also not useable. 
 Can it really be that difficult to get real black text on real white background? What is the obvious thing I'm missing? I'm happy to have some syntax highlighting in (dark) gray, but the main text needs to be pure black, and most importantly the background should be actual white. 
 Please help, my inability to get something so trivial to work is hurting my self-esteem!

However, in emacs 28.3 a lot of his commands seem to be missing. Does anyone know what package provides org-batch-store-agenda-views or org-agenda-export-to-ics ?
 Doom emacs only provides org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files for exporting .ics.
 This command seems necessary to replace VTODO with VEVENT types.
 WORKAROUND: You can just run sed command on the exported .ics instead whenever cron job exports .ics to replace all VTODO with VEVENT: sed -i 's/VEVENT/VTODO/g' org.ics

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for here, so this is going to be a bit open-ended. But I was wondering if there was a way to produce statistics on a group of org files. Here are some examples of what I mean.
 Example #1 - Tag Count
 You create TODO items over an entire year. Your TODO's all have at least one, but possibly more, tags. Those tags are "Work", "School", "Personal", "Spouse", "Home", and "Fun", for example. At the end of the year, you want to know how you divided your time. Is there an easy way to produce output like this:
  
Work - 30
 School - 28
 Personal - 24
 Spouse - 20
 Home - 17
 Fun - 11
  
Example #2 - Avg Time
 You spend a year completing tasks. At the end of that year, is there an easy way to display how long tasks took to complete? Maybe broken down by tag?
 I'm sure there are lots of other ways of summarizing and splicing the various meta data collected, so if anyone has any suggestions, I'm open to it.

 My question applies even if I skip the tmux step. In my term window I may want to edit a file that is local to the remote. Running emacs in that window, I loose control of emacs shortcuts: everything including closing the remote emacs goes to my emacsclient running on my laptop. Is there a way to solve this? Can I keep my workflow, and edit a file remotely like this? 
 In solving this, I don't want to give up on all shortcuts passed to my local emacsclient when I am not editing a file remotely like this.
 This is not the same as running emacs inside multi-term that is running bash locally. For that, I use emacsclient (my local emacs is running as a server) and so I can open any file in my emacs client locally. One solution would be to pass -X to ssh and have a gui running locally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there!
 I am pretty new to emacs and at the moment I try to configure lsp-mode with pylsp. In my understanding I can just use a hook at prog-mode to run lsp (seems to work). The only problem is that emacs wont find pylsp. I allready hacked something together to prepend the emacs intern PATH var (read by using (getenv "PATH") with the path to the directory which contains the pylsp executable but it just says that it cannot find it. This problem only exists when starting emacs via dmenu and not via a "normal" terminal which uses my zshrc with the appropriate PATH var I guess.
 My config can be found here
 Any help would be appreciated. Have a Great Day!

Basically, I started the Emacs journey from Spacemacs, to another programmers (stranger, Kaushal Modi) config (init.el). Im okay with learning slowly at my own pace, and Im learning eLisp at my own pace. I ve been using S-<right> and S-<left> for navigation (same goes for up and down). I was okay for months, but now Im looking to remove that Shift for good. Using hardcore-mode seems to work, but Id have to do it everytime I startup. Setting (hardcore-mode 0) doesnt work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been making "come-here..." eyes at emacs for a year or more now, but also had a pretty crazy year, which has led to a return to school for a career change. Looking for a good, cross-platform note-taking/workflow thing, and heard about Obsidian, Evernote, Roam, Foam...and came across this thread. Talm' bout eMacs being able to do a lot of what the new-fangled apps are bragging about. Put it this way - I got a couple months that are kinda-sorta free, so if you're telling me this is a valid excuse to run through emacs, I'm sold. One step closer to achieving true FOSS nerd-dom, after dabbling in it from the edges.
 But, like I said in the title, I'm mostly a fan of FOSS for ideological reasons, and past recognizing names of things I don't actually have that much ability. So, I gotta be that guy and ask for any advice on easy-to-set-up-and-understand emacs-centered solutions to note-taking. Specifically, I need something that I can sync between my Linux Mint laptop and Android, or that I can make sync. Searchable across devices/files is big, too. I can go a step further in being an entitled new guy, if there are any good resources - youtube playlists, blogs, articles, whatever - on something like "designing/customizing workflow for your industry/goals in emacs," that'd be cool, too.
 Thanks for bearing w/me, here's hoping I'll finally be joining this community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I'm a new Emacs user who's been using Doom Emacs but I recently decided to switch over to a personal config. One things that I want to do asap is set up a lot of my keybinds to mostly mirror the ones set by Doom. That being said, there are a lot of binds to copy over and I don't want to do all of the hard manual labor of setting them all. More specifically, I want to copy over a lot of the useful leader key functionality that Doom sets. For instance, if I were to hit <leader> W in Doom, it would function about the same as if I hit <C-w> in evil mode. As of right now, I'm using the general package to set my binds for the leader key manually but it's kind of a pain in the ass, especially for such a massive set of commands like the <C-w> or <C-h> functionality. Is there a way to either 
 A.) More easily port over most of the keybinds from Doom? (I know a lot of them are package specific but still)
 B.) Easily set certain default Emacs keybinds to other key combinations? (E.g set <Leader> W to be equivalent to <C-w> and <Leader> H to be equivalent to <C-h>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! I'm a bit confused with the goal of permanent note in a standard ZK workflow.
Sometimes, I feel it is redundant or useless.
Context: I mainly use note-taking to capture and convert informations into pieces of reusable cards (for technical docs). My main interest are science (physics/math) and computer science (programing/software/web).
What I pretend to know about permanent note
In pure theory, I believe (maybe I'm wrong ) a permanent note is a card :
that should contain enough text about a specific topic (atomic)
that should contain enough informations to "live alone" (self-contained)
that should be reusable in other topic context (portable)
that should contain links to spread the web
that should contain references to sources (context)
The permenant note, from my head to paper
When I have an idea, I write it down to paper (fleeting note) and I must convert this note into a well-formed, in my own word permanent note.
I am unconfortable with this new permanent note because there is no reference at all.
The permanent note, from books to idea
When I read about literary note (or reference note), it is said I should pick up an interesting passage, write it into my own words and so on.
literary note into multiple "ideas" which are called permanent note.
I really don't see the difference between the aggregated permanent note in my literary note.
This feeling is intensified when I write a technical subject (e.g. http).
Maybe I suffer from misconception and you could provide some keys to understand please.
If someone knows about some basic samples of ZK implementations, it would be great !
Thank you !]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Please install https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/emacs-gc-stats.html and send the generated statistics via email to emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org after several weeks.
 Many of us know that Emacs defaults for garbage collection are rather ancient and often cause singificant slowdowns. However, it is hard to know which alternative defaults will be better.
 Emacs devs need help from users to obtain real-world data about Emacs garbage collection. See the discussion in https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/87v8j6t3i9.fsf@localhost/
 I wrote a small package https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/emacs-gc-stats.html that will collect garbage collection stats during Emacs sessions. Please, install it and later (after few weeks) submit the results to emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org
 Usage:
 Add
 (require 'emacs-gc-stats) (setq emacs-gc-stats-gc-defaults 'emacs-defaults) ; optional (emacs-gc-stats-mode +1) 
 to your init file to enable the statistics acquiring.
 When you are ready to share the results, run M-x emacs-gc-stats-save-session and then share the saved emacs-gc-stats-file (defaults to ~/.emacs.d/emacs-gc-stats.eld) by sending an email attachment to <mailto:emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org>.
 You can use M-x emacs-gc-stats-clear to clear the currently collected session data.
 The following data is being collected after every command:
  
 GC settings gc-cons-threshold and gc-cons-percentage
  Emacs version and whether Emacs framework (Doom, Prelude, etc) is used
  Whether gcmh-mode is used
  Idle time and Emacs uptime
  Available OS memory (see memory-info)
  Emacs memory allocation/GC stats
  Current command

 I have found an issue when update the header line(although I am not sure if this even is an issue).
 While displaying information in the header line, not everything is updated at the same time in the *Messages* buffer.
 Code I used to enable header line in scratch buffer:
 (setq wat 0) (defun initialize-header-line () (interactive) (setq header-line-format '(:eval (message (format "header line updated %d" (setq wat (+ wat 1))))))) 
 My question is:
 Why is the header line being updated on every key movement, but the *Messages* buffer doesn't display the "header line updated" on every key movement? Is this expected?
 I also added a gif screencast to show this issue(sorry for the quality, This is the best that I was able to record):

 Getting an error that org-agenda-mode-map is void variable 
 I also tried
  
 both :map commands under 1 :bind heading
 define-key org-agenda-mode-map style of binding (same error)
  
of note after my startup config loads I can run this execute and it executes which seems to me like there is some load issue with the map during the use-package setup but once my config loads I can "rerun" the code block and make it work...not ideal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Orgzly is a popular android client that allows you to edit org files in a feature-rich and intuitive way. However, for over 4 years its syncing mechanism for local repositories (not webdav) suffered from a critical bug.
 If you try to delete a file on one of your machines orgzly (running on another machine) will recreate it - meaning you can't ever delete any file in your org-mode directory AND have it synced with orgzly. This makes any form of administration that relies on many disparate files impossible (e.g. org-roam):
 https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android/issues/287
 If anyone has any experience with developing on android and would like to support this otherwise great project, this may be a perfect opportunity to do so.
 UPDATE: it is possible that the project might have been abandoned.
 UPDATE2: As mentioned in the comments syncing with WebDAV instead of local directories may not to have this issue. I'm checking if nextcloud provides encryption when using WebDAV (if someone has already configured it please let me know).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried Chemacs2 but switching to my Org Mode based Emacs config that has a 'config.org' with 'init.el' doesn't work as easy as just literally using GNU Stow with 'stow -t ~/.emacs.d'. The problem with that is that I have to constantly wipe out that '~/.emacs.d' directory each time, let it install everything, and let 'vterm' compile again which takes a good 5 mins each time.
 ​
 Goal:
  
I'm trying to switch between my normal config and the Spacemacs config.
 This is because I've been trying to check out Spacemacs to see what I like from it to later then adapt it with my own config or just use Spacemacs for web dev projects since I hate configuring LSP myself.
  
​
 Questions:
 Q1. Has anyone with an Org Mode based config used anything similar, and if so, what have you used?
 Q2. Or should I somehow add my actual Emacs config to the Spacemacs config too? If so, how?
  
I ask this because there are some quality of life changes I have in my normal Emacs config that annoy me so much for the defaults for Emacs in general, especially with Org mode defaults sometimes.
  
Thanks

 *bold*
 =code=
 ~highlight~
 By default selection seems to include them even when they are toggled off (not shown) in the buffer. Copying such small portions of text frequently to the clipboard can get a bit annoying after a while.
 If you are using evil mode (vim keybindings) key combination v i W will select the entire word and those surrounding characters. It would be nice to find some way to avoid this.

 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32423127/how-to-view-the-next-days-in-org-modes-agenda
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/12517/how-do-i-make-the-timespan-shown-by-org-agenda-start-yesterday
 But this question is about "scrolling" aka "moving agenda view up or down" by adding previous or subsequent days to the view.
 You can change org-agenda-start-day variable, but I'm not sure how to "regenerate" the view then? There also doesn't seem to be an equivalent "org-agenda-end-day"? Perhaps someone knows a better way to approach this?
 SOLUTION: If you are using doom emacs you can "scroll" by showing previous/next "period" with square brackets ([ previous and ] next). Commands are called org-agenda-earlier and org-agenda-later (a bit hard to find).
 If someone still knew how to "scroll" by adding/removing earlier/later days in the current view that would be still very useful.

 Is there a command to write all committed changes to the corresponding files?
 This question was addressed already on emacs stackexchange: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/477/how-do-i-automatically-save-org-mode-buffers
 The command is org-save-all-org-buffers and is bound by default to C-x C-s
 However what if you have some other org buffers opened that you didn't mean to save when editing org-agenda items at the same time?
 Maybe there is something like org-save-all-org-agenda-buffer to only save the buffers edited in org-agenda?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've repeatedly seen the claim that frequent breaking changes to the language are one reason why Scala isn't more widely adopted in the industry. While I can only speak from my personal experience I don't really see the point here. It seems to me that other languages and ecosystems get away with big changes:
  
Python's adoption has only increased after the infamous 2 -> 3 version change.
 JavaScript itself is backwards-compatible with older versions, but the JS ecosystem keeps changing a lot. For example the industry was happy to adopt React even though it introduces breaking changes with major version updates.
  
What are your takes on this matter? Is feature churn that much higher in Scala? Has language instability been discussed in your organization? Has it impacted any team's decision to use or not use Scala? Will the introduction of LTS versions help Scala's adoption grow in the long-term or will it just make library maintainers happier?

I saw this thread: https://github.com/jimeh/build-emacs-for-macos/issues/45 where it was mentioned that you have to turn off the MacOS specific flag, so I’m not sure if it’s more harm than good, and what benefit it may serve. Anyone have experience optimizing their emacs on MacOS as much as possible? I basically run native comp vanilla emacs with only about 100 lines in my init file, which I byte compile (I’m not sure if the init file byte compilation helps? It seems like even though packages get compiled down natively, going into the native code folder (alongside byte compilations) , init.el doesn’t have an option for it).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 All-the-icons maintainer here.
 Over the years, all-the-icons have been inundated by user issues about mis-aligning fonts, tofus and font installation or code point clashing problems. This is all the result of cross-pollination of a set of Web front end tricks of a certain era to Emacs.
 The problems of using icon font are
  
They require extra manual installation of fonts
 Amalgamation of different icon fonts designed for different grids and negative spaces result in non-uniform display of fonts
 Code point clashes
 Updating the fonts and their mappings are painful
 Fonts don't scale properly even with a lot of manual adjustments
 The project gets an incessant amount of issues opened due to all of the above
  
Since last August, I have been experimenting with simply using the SVG sources of these fonts directly instead, and I'm happy to announce that I'm satisfied with the result enough that I want to invite the community to try out the SVG branch.
 There are now over 18000 icons included in the package, and over 31000 when you count all the variations. Chances are, if you are looking for an icon that looks good and appropriate, it's probably in there.
 The public API largely remains the same, but there are some backward incompatible changes in the private APIs. Please refer to the README for details.
 Judging from Github searches, these changes do not appear to cause too much breakage, but I could be wrong. Please let me know on Github as I do not plan to come back to Reddit too often because of a certain u/spez.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm interested in creating forms using org-mode where information entered beneath each heading can be saved to an sqlite database, with each org-mode heading being the column heading for the sql table.
 I am using the emacsql package for saving the information to the database, and so long as the entries are placed in a vector, an emacsql function will be able to save the entries to the sql table.
 With the help of chatgpt, I've found several ways of parsing the org-mode headers and saving the entries within each header to a vector. When I display the vector in emacs, the entries look exactly as I would expect.
 However, when I save them to the database, each entry not only includes the text that I want, but a bunch of elisp code around it that appears to be coding the relative position of the text within the org file. It's as if the text has a bunch of Metadata attached to it that is invisible within emacs but becomes visible when taken out of emacs and put into the database. I've tried many different ways but all end with the same outcome.
 It's clear that there's a problem with the methods im using, so I'm wondering if anyone has been able to successfully do something like this before or has some suggestions as to why this is happening and how to fix it. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 ​
 I'm new to ZIO and currently exploring the concepts of ZIO environment, ZLayers, and ZEnvironment. As I delve into the ZIO documentation and source code, I feel like I'm missing a few pieces to fully grasp how they fit together. I'd greatly appreciate your insights in helping me form a complete picture.
 ​
 In the `ZIO[R, E, A]` effect, the type parameter `R` is referred to as the environment type or the ZIO environment of type `R`. The ZIO environment can be constructed by composing ZLayers. By using accessor methods provided by the ZIO datatype, we can access the ZIO environment of a specific type to execute the effect.
 ​
 Here's where I am seeking clarification: Is it correct to say that ZIO constructs the ZIO environment of the required type `R` from the ZIO environment built by composing the layers? The ZIO environment constructed from the layers will have a different type, but ZIO effects need a specific ZIO environment of a particular type.
 ​
 Furthermore, I am curious about the role of ZEnvironment in all of this. How does it fit into the overall picture?
 ​
 I am grateful for any insights or explanations you can provide to help me better understand these concepts and their interactions.
 ​
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star buffers are sometimes useful but I almost never need them and see them as clutter. Consult makes it really easy to modify and add sources. Here how to put star buffers out of mind but still include them in the buffer list by putting them at the bottom of your buffers list when using consult-buffer. This example removes star buffers from the main buffer source and creates a new source for them.
 (defvar consult--source-star (list :name "*Star-Buffers*" :category 'buffer :narrow ?s :face 'consult-buffer :history 'buffer-name-history :state #'consult--buffer-state :items (lambda () (consult--buffer-query :sort 'visibility :as #'buffer-name :include '("\\*."))))) ;; modify buffer source to exclude star sources (setq consult--source-buffer (plist-put consult--source-buffer :items (lambda () (consult--buffer-query :sort 'visibility :as #'buffer-name :exclude '("\\*."))))) ;; reorder sources and add star source at the end (setq consult-buffer-sources '(consult--source-hidden-buffer consult--source-modified-buffer consult--source-buffer consult--source-bookmark consult--source-recent-file consult--source-file-register consult--source-project-buffer-hidden consult--source-project-recent-file-hidden consult--source-star)) 
 If you truly want to hide them you can use :hidden per the documentation https://github.com/minad/consult#multiple-sources but I find putting them under recent files good enough.

You can do it interactively with (delete-other-windows), but it doesn't seem to work from terminal: (progn (org-capture) (delete-other-windows)) .
 There were a few attempts to do it already in 2013:
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15253005/in-emacs-org-mode-how-do-i-get-org-capture-to-open-in-a-full-sized-window
 in 2015:
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21195327/emacs-force-org-mode-capture-buffer-to-open-in-a-new-window
 and in 2018:
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/46460/org-capture-frame-with-no-splits
 None of which seem to work in 2023 (doom) emacs. Has anyone by any chance recently configured this and would be kind enough to share it? Or are you using org-capture in a completely different way that skips this problem altogether? Or are you using some other package for quick note taking?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My configuration of Eglot is simple: (use-package eglot :hook (c-mode . eglot-ensure)). And it works for a single c file. But when I use this setup to read the code of NetHack, it doesn't work for linting and definition finding (M-.), even though eglot connection has no problem. I observed the same problems when reading the code of SQLite. Some specific problems I observed:
 for #include "hack.h"
  
clang [pp_file_not_found]: 'hack.h' file not found
  
for boolean known;
  
clang [unknown_typename]: Unknown type name 'boolean'
  
I think the problem may be due to a mismatch of C version between the code and clangd. But how can I tell clangd to check a specific version of C (eg. C99)?
 (Edit) I just tried to use `c-ts-mode`, and for some reason the linting issues went away but I still cannot jump using (M-.).
 (Edit 2) It seems that the problems in SQLite source code went away when I use c-ts-mode.
 (Edit 3) Still have the following problem when I use (M-.) in NetHack code:
  
No definitions found for: LSP identifier at point

Applications such as a-Shell already provide a terminal environment for running WASM binaries. Running Emacs locally on your iPad has many benefits compared to running it on a remote host.
 One of the challenges with cross-compiling Emacs is the dumping. Perhaps a way around that is to just use “temacs”, which avoids the dumping step.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever I take a course, all the relevant material is spread across multiple platforms: Moodle, Microsoft Teams, personal websites, boards from the previous years...
 Every time I start a new course I have to navigate across all these pages and archive everything that I could possibly need: slides, assignments, exams from previous years, etc...
 However, there are a bunch of issues:
  
Storing everything in the file system is a mess: not everything can be stored as a file. Some things (like an online quiz) are meant to be stored as simple bookmarks. This heterogeneity breaks the purpose of "having only one place to look at" for me
 
Given "exam-2-4-2005.pdf", I'd like to write some information related to it: whether i have already done it, and the solution. Sometimes the solution is on paper, so all I need to write is a simple number that corresponds to the page on my paper notebook.
 
 Using org mode, I can link both local files and Http URLs (also pdf pages!). I could also write notes related to each one of them.
 Does any of you have a similar workflow in your Emacs routine? Is there some suggestion or package that could aid me for this purpose? This is the first time I use org for something beyond note taking, so I really do not have any "concrete" idea on how to achieve all this.

Yas snippet or org-time-stamp commands let you add a timestamp anywhere in the document, but it may get tedious with larger lists. Ideally there would be some way for a timestamp to be bound to the new item creation? Would you just add a yasnippet to a new keybinding (for example Ctrl+Shift+RET)? If anyone has such an example in their config I would really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I tried to use Eglot + pyright on Django project.
 But pyright doesn't works as expected, can not get completion on when import django.db.model
 Any one known how to make pyright works with Django?
 Steps to reproduce:
 ​
  
setup project
  
​
 mkdir django-project cd django-project python3 -m venv ./.venv .venv/bin/python3 -m pip install django source .venv/bin/activate django-admin startproject CoreRoot . django-admin startapp core python manage.py migrate python manage.py runserver 
  
Install Pyright
  
sudo npm install -g pyright
  
Install pyvenv for activate virtual environment in Emacs
 (use-package pyvenv :hook (python-mode . pyvenv-mode) :config (setq pyvenv-post-activate-hooks (list (lambda () (setq python-shell-interpreter (concat pyvenv-virtual-env (if (eq system-type 'windows-nt) "scripts/python" "bin/python")))))))
 
Start Emacs and open the file: django-project/core/models.py
 
M-x pyvenv-activate and choose the .venv directory
 
M-x eglot, and choose pyright-langserver
 
Try some example code in django-project/core/models.py as below:
 from django.db import models
 class Person(models.Model): first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30) last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
 
You find that you can't get completion for "CharField", see pictures as below:
 
 ​
 can get models
 ​
 Can not get CharField
 ​
 9 . I also tried python-language-server(pylsp), it can get completion but the server is a little slow, I can feel delay while input characters.
 ​
 works as expected with pylsp
 You can test with this example project: https://github.com/Eason0210/django-project.git
 My personal Emacs config: https://github.com/Eason0210/.emacs.d
 my Emacs version:
 GNU Emacs 30.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-apple-darwin22.5.0, NS appkit-2299.60 Version 13.4 (Build 22F66), git sha1 8657afac774) of 2023-06-16

Clicking on any file in the Zettel View window opens the Zettel markdown file in an editor window and causes the file explorer to highlight the selected file.  Since I installed the "Auto-Open Markdown Preview" VS Code extension, the markdown preview of the selected Zettel also appears.
The Zettel View extension for VS Code is available on my GitHub account.
Zettel View makes some assumptions about Zettels. First, Zettels are markdown files with the extension .md. Second, a markdown file's H1 or level-one header has the form # ID TITLE (the ID is to the left; some prefer the ID on the right). Third, ID matches a regular expression specific to my ID scheme. Fourth, ID.md is the filename of the Zettel markdown file with the header # ID TITLE.
The second and third assumptions are hard-coded but could be made configurable in later versions of the extension. The fourth assumption isn't enforced: a mismatch between ID.md and the filename will appear as a discrepancy between the Zettel selected in the Zettel View and the file explorer. A warning will be emitted in that case.
Zettr has the built-in configuration setting, "Display files using first heading level 1 if available." A community plugin for Obsidian called "File Explorer Markdown Titles" once produced a similar display in the Obsidian file explorer. Unfortunately, that plugin no longer works with newer versions of Obsidian. Since VS Code is more valuable for my work than Obsidian, it made more sense to develop a VS Code extension than to modify the plugin to work with the current Obsidian API. I plan to move to VS Code the Pandoc and LaTeX integration I configured in Zettlr.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I m using Doom Emacs and am converting an existing program to an Org mode literate style format with a TOC etc. so as to make clear whats going on. When I insert headings code blocks are automatically indented - which is what I want - but white arrows appear for each indentation and these are overlayed with gray blocks (a bit like Visual blocks), which I don't want. Nothing I have tried seems to get rid of either the arrows or the gray blocks. Is there some function that shuts this off as it's visually really distracting? Thx in advance... 
 P.S. The white arrows might be difficult to see under the gray block but they are there sure enough!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I have been doing some programming in python. I have got it working nicely in Emacs - I may share my configuration another time.
 I'm have a problem with imports though. In Python you bring in a library by "importing" it. I often have to edit libraries that are part of the project I'm working on. The problem is that in Python 3 you can't unload a library, nor can you replace it with a newer version.
 This is a problem because Emacs python-mode is based around the idea of sending python code to a python shell. This works fine unless imports get involved. Once imports get involved you run into the problem that python will never re-import a library after it has imported it once. So, if you're editing a library the only way to update to the new version (which could be what you just wrote) is to stop the python process and start another one.
 Is there a fix for this? Has anyone written a package to at least make constantly restarting python more convenient?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently using C++ in Emacs with lsp-mode. I use CMake to generate compile_commands.json with set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON).
 So far, this has been working great -- until I had to write template implementation files:
 Refresher: 
  
In non-templated C++, #include "header.hpp" goes at start of implementation.cpp file.
 
In templated C++, #include "implementation.tpp" goes at end of header.hpp file. 
 
 Basically, since implementation.tpp doesn't explicitly "include" its header definitions, the LSP thinks I am just writing out things without defining them, resulting in a bunch of squiggly lines.
 I know a lot of people just put their template implementation code in the header file, but I really want to keep it separate. Have any C++ users encountered this problem before and found a solution? Thanks.

 * TODO Task 1 * TODO Task 2 * TODO Task 3 
 After some time you complete these tasks and want to add new ones. Where do you add them? Do you add them to the same file? Do you create a new file after the first one gets too big? Do you manually perform clean up of the file every so often?
 It may be unrelated, but I'm wondering how do you add new entries? I imagine that if file gets really big opening and navigating it may get slow after some time. Do you have custom capture templates for that? Do you manually open that file navigate to the top or bottom and add entries there?
 There seems to be a lot of manual processes involved here, which I assume people have figured out how to automate already, but I can't quite find out where.
 In org agenda calendar view there is some mention of a "diary file" - is that the place where these entries should be stored instead of organizing them manually?

 in this blog post I wrote back in 2018, I had described how to set up a function for org-mode in EMACS, that allows you to take screenshots and include them in your org-file with just one move. An example application looks like this: GIF
 There is now a new version of the function with improved interface and functionality, you can find it in the post above, or directly in the gitlab repo. The corresponding snippet can be found here.
 Hope it helps, I'm looking forward to any kind of feedback.

 I hope you're all having a great day. I'm a newbie to Emacs, and I've been doing some exploring to find the best fit for me. I started with Spacemacs, but to be honest, it felt overwhelming, and I couldn't get all its spirit.
 Then, I gave Doom Emacs a shot, and I was simpler, yet it still seems to have all the functionality I need. For me, doom-emacs offers me a great experience, though. 
 That said, I have a minor concern. I noticed they released the last significant update back in March. More concerning, though, is that there seem to be quite a few unanswered pull requests, some of which appear to be pretty important in terms of features or fixes.
 So, in my complete ignorance, I first want to ask you guys experts about the situation. 
 Is Doom Emacs still being actively maintained? If not, what do you think is the best way, return to Spacemacs or try another configuration kit? 
 Thanks for your insights and suggestions. 
 Best.

I want to export a certain company/project TODO list I am working on, to a CSV file, in order to produce a shareable ongoing progress report of my work onlne. I've gotten the Emacs built in macro org-batch-agenda-csv working somewhat using a command like this:
 (org-batch-agenda-csv "MYTAG1|MYTAG2")
 Where I'm struggling is with date/time information. I assumed that if my TODOs have a typical SCHEDULED attribute that i'd easily discover date/time info in the generated csv. So far, no such luck.
 The help for org-batch-agenda-csv macro talks about optional (rest) Parameters that "are alternating variable names and values that will be bound before running the agenda command." This sounds extremely useful but I'm not sure how to proceed without perhaps examples of how these could be used for some typical uses.
 There are also a handful of references to date/time things in both the Emacs online help for the macro, and in the elisp macro definition. I am not an Emacs Lisp expert though and so far my randomish trial and error has gone nowhere.
 Can you help?
 Thanks!

 I'm writing an application using vanilla js + WebGL and my development stack is:
  
emacs
 lsp-mode
 company-mode
 ts-ls installed through emacs
  
My LSP config is here, and I'm open to suggestions for improving it.
 Completion works fine for the core parts of javascript, e.g. getElementByID() and friends. But if I want to call into, let's say, the canvas API, I don't have completion working. Here's an example:
 var canvas = document.getElementById("foo"); var ctx = canvas.getContext("bar"); 
 screenshot
 Note how the getContext isn't offered by the language server as a completion option.
 Here's a second example:
 xmlr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xmlr.open('GET', url, false); 
 Similarly, the open isn't offered as a completion option.
 How do I fix this? I've tried setting both a tsconfig.json and a jsconfig.json with the following contents:
 { "compilerOptions": { "target": "es2020", "lib": ["es2020"], "module": "commonjs" } } 
 But no dice. I still don't get completion in the examples above.
 What do?

 elisp noob here...
 I am setting a variable depending on the hostname and have this in my init.el:
 ;; here is code that sets mh/org-dir (setq org-agenda-files mh/org_dir) (cd mh/org_dir) 
 the cd works but when I try to open the agenda I get "org-agenda-files cannot be a single directory".
 My question now: If you have the name of a directory in a variable: how do you add all the org-files in that directory to the agenda?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I finally found a few hours to implement 2 features from swiper that I missed in consult-line:
 ​
  
Smart recenter: buffer is recentered only if you jump to match outside of current view. (This can be done in a pretty non-invasive way via hooks)
 Highlighting of matches on all visible lines in buffer. This is a noticeable patch to core consult code. Instead of creating a patch/fork, I just put into a separate file which I load after consult itself, it redefines quite a few core functions. It might break with newer consult versions.
  
​
 Feel free to try: https://gist.github.com/lazy/4f609cf2b956de2531885747e3c3bf88
 Save it to "consult-patch.el" file, open in emacs, M-x eval-buffer, run consult-line, search for something like "let" and enjoy.
 ​
 UPD: gist was updated at least once. Overlay caching didn't move overlays between windows. Now it doef.
 ​
 P.S. I saw another approach to doing that: https://github.com/minad/consult/pull/774. But minad decided not to merge it due to perf and personal preference. Mine is a little better performance-wise: it checks for highlighting only visible candidates and caches the highlight overlays (of which there can be many). But I am not sure if I will be able to overcome minad's personal preference, so don't want to bother with PR. If someone wants to polish this code and try merge into mainline, I won't mind. Think of this code as "public domain".
 P.P.S. I don't use swiper because I have quite a lot of custom vertico/vertico-posframe/consult configuration which I do not want to replicate for swiper.

 I am trying to generate a report from an org file with R code blocks.
 ​
 Blocks are defined such as:
 ​
 #+begin_src R :results output round(cov(phenmz1),3) #+end_src 
 ​
 And I have an option at the header:
 #+PROPERTY: exports both 
 Now, when I run org-html-export-to-html, code is run but the contents of the code block are substituted with nilbody.
 ​
 - What is likely the issue with this case?

I'm curious if Scala can offer suitable implementations, based on its language features, to make the development of asynchronous streaming text applications easier, just like popular older Scala projects in the field of big data.
 AI and LLM have made Python great again; perhaps Scala can demonstrate its power in new domains.
 P.S. I'm currently working on a closed-source Java-lang project for our LLM project, built on Reactor. Just asking for fun.

 It's, well, a calculator for your Android phone.
 It's got all the usual buttons with numbers and operators, and also parentheses as well as buttons for storing the partial results of your calculations to the memory.
 But that's not all. It also has an advanced editor hidden under the "Fx" button. In that mode, you can write an expression with your virtual keyboard, as if you were writing simple programming code. You can use variables and functions from a list, combine them, and even write your own custom ones. They will be stored on the phone so they can be actually useful to you more than once.
 And, on top of that, FxCalculator was written in Scala 3, with JavaFX, Gluon, and GraalVM Native Image. For now it's available only as APK stored on GitHub. You can install it by allowing 3rd party APK installation on your Android, clicking the link above on your phone, and then downloading and installing the APK from there.
 I will try to push the app to the Google store and create a better looking webpage for it later this year.

 I gave a quick run around the posts about emacs server/daemon and I have a couple of questions
  
If you don't put any special arguments by default and you run emacs --daemon this will have a Unix socket right? Which means that both server and client will be on localhost.
 You can also specify a TCP socket allowing the server and the client to live on separate hosts. Is this right?
 Finally, if and when this happens when you edit files with emacsclient do you edit files on the client side or on the server side? Would this be a good use for editing files both on the server and the client? Or you should have something separate to edit files on the server? i.e. use git or ssh or nextcloud
  
Thank you very much for your help.

 Over the past month or so, images in tweets shown in nitter have stopped displaying in EWW, but can be seen on an external browser like Firefox. 
 For instance, in this tweet, there is a profile picture and an embedded .jpg image of a football/soccer player which both show up in Firefox. However, when viewed in EWW only the poster's profile picture is shown. This is not the case for images that show up as "previews" of webpages, e.g. in this tweet, both the profile picture and the previewed image of aircraft from the article both show up in EWW.
 I thought this issue would explain why, but the images I see in Firefox are .jpg, not webp. This might still be a nitter issue, but I would be interested to understand why this has happened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a follow-up to this old thread, I am pleased to announce the first release of the Kreuzberg Library.
 The library's primary purpose is to simplify the creation of declarative ScalaJS components.
 The concept is straightforward:
  
Components can subscribe to models, which contain some state.
 Components declare event bindings (e.g., click events) that, in turn, modify models.
 If a model changes, the components emit new HTML (including event bindings and sub-components).
 The new HTML gets rendered.
  
Additionally, Channels are included, which offer n:m communication and can be incorporated into event bindings (as sources and sinks).
 HTML rendering can be performed via Scalatags and Scala XML, but other mechanisms can also be implemented.
 The rendering engine can be changed. Currently, there are two simple client-side engines available: a simple imperative, and a ZIO-Based.
 A proof-of-concept RPC system is also available. You can declare a trait for a service, and macros will generate a stub for the client (ScalaJS) app and dispatcher code for the server side. In the examples, this is used to implement a TODO app with server-side storage.
 Components, Models, and Channels are identified by IDs, which are currently auto-incremented. This isn't entirely functional. I've experimented with other ideas, like creating IDs via a State-Monad, but they ended up being less practical.
 I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

 I've tried cycling visibility to show level one headers only and doing a visual selection of line Foo2 and Foo3 then using regexp-replace and :s/... but in both cases the replacement takes place on the folded lines under Foo2 and Foo3 too.
 * Foo1 ** Sub * Foo2 ** Sub * Foo3 ** Sub * Foo4 ** Sub 
 UPDATE Setting search-invisible to nil prior to the replacement, works as long as 1) I use regexp-replace, and 2) the search is for plain text (not a regexp) only. 
 If I search for $ then neither regexp-replace nor :substitute work.
 UPDATE 2 Oopsie, I predominantly use spacemacs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am starting a process via start-process-shell-command. The command starts server, and is actually never "finished" as the server is continuously running. However, one can infer when this command is finished, that is to say when the server is up and running, by looking at the output (i.e. when the string "Server is running!" is observed in the output).
 I want to code up an Elisp function that calls the command, wait until the server is up and running, and only then execute the next step. How would I best do this?
 My current method is check the relevant process-buffer every 0.5 sec (with sleep-for) to see if the known regex pattern is observed, however this seems a bit sub-optimal. In particular I am unable to use Emacs until the pattern is observed (even though my process is async).
 I have tried to read up on process filters as my understanding is that they are functions which receive output from processes, but I can't figure out a way to "wait" until the regex pattern is observed via filters.
 Does anyone have any idea how to reliably achieve this, or any pointers on where I should look to understand process filters better to get to my solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven’t really used emacs too much yet, but I love the idea of using it for taking notes and organizing my life with org mode. Funny enough, I feel like I’m procrastinating organizing my life cause I’m thinking “wait I need to get org mode set up first”.
 The problem is, I’ve seen people say it takes YEARS to understand emacs and that it has an incredibly high learning curve. I wouldn’t mind using something like doom or centaur, but at the same time, it seems weird to use a preconfigured editor and not understand what’s going on underneath the hood, especially if there’s an issue and I don’t know how to fix it. You think that’s a big deal or is using those preset editors perfectly fine? I’m looking to use vim bindings so I wonder if I should just stay with doom.
 I’m planning on reading “Mastering Emacs”, working through the built in tutorial, the elisp tutorial (maybe, but it seems weird to not understand the language the entire applications is built and configured in), and maybe Emacs from Scratch and the org mode udemy tutorial by Rainer Konig.
 After all that maybe I’ll know enough to build my own config, or at least understand a lot of what goes on in doom or centaur or something.

with the concept of property-based testing, and have first hand
experience with a framework like QuickCheck or hedgehog. You might

just like what we’ve already been doing for so long, right? Just
generate a bunch of random test inputs, in the hope of exposing an
unknown bug?
Well, actually there’s more to it than that! Recently, I had some fun
exploring coverage-guided fuzzers like AFL++ and libFuzzer. Along
the way, I discovered a simple trick that allows us to compile Haskell
code in a manner that these fuzzers can handle. The experience was

 describe-face tells me the delimiters are getting fontified with the default face. I'd like to customize that.
 treesitter-inspect-mode tells me that I'd need to highlight nodes matching a query like jsx_opening_element "<", jsx_opening_element ">", etc. I saw the recent Mastering Emacs article on Treesitter which was very helpful in getting started, but it wasn't clear to me how to customize fine details like this.

I would have thought this is something done commonly but I'm having issues. At first I made the method like so:
 partitionInPlace[A <: Ordered[A]] (...
 But it turns out common AnyVal types such as Int and Double don't extend Ordered, so that's not suitable. They extend Ordering but that's not quite the same and it seems silly to use a function such as "gteq" instead of a simple operator.
 I have a feeling the solution is some kind of implicit conversion? Please help, I'm kind of new to Scala and I'm sure this is a common issue.

 Thank you for your help :)

 EDIT: Thank you the problem is solving :)
 I added this in ~/.emacs
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I've been programming in Java but wanted to try something new from the ecosystem and chose Scala. However, I've encountered a major problem. Sbt starts syncing my projects but never finishes. I even let it run for entire day and nothing happened.
 I've tried basic troubleshooting: reinstalling IntelliJ Idea (2023.1.2), running different versions of sbt ( 1.9.2, 1.8.3, 1.8.2, 1.7.3 ), reinstalling Scala (2.13.19 and 2.13.17), disabling Windows Defender, installing different JDKs (19, 17, 11, 1.8), removing .lock, file, checking logs - they are empty. I even upgraded from Windows 10 to Windows 11.
 I know that Scala works better on Linux, but I tested a similar scenario on my friend's Windows 10 laptop and it worked like a charm. 
 Here's screenshot of my last attempt:

 Honestly, i have no idea what else I can do. I've read through many GitHub issues for sbt and nothing has helped. Has anyone else encountered simillar problem? Any tips or suggestions on what I can do next would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in the midst of thinking about my overall workflow, may even setup a Linux box to use for work (right now on Mac).
 I've been using Obsidian for notes, it kinda works. But have been thinking about Org mode for a while now for both my personal notes and work notes.
 Generally, I'm assigned to a project/client for a period of time. I have thought about creating an org folder in home then a org/client for the client or project then something like: - meetings.org for meetings and calls - notes.org for client or project specific notes - tickets.org for any sort of ticketing system they use to help keep track of those without having to login to the ticket system.
 TODOs would of course roll up to Org Agenda.
 More general notes would be in the main Org file.
 Any tips or thoughts on how to manage a similar workflow? Open to ideas.
 I would setup some capture templates to make it easier to add data to these. Maybe even org-roam at some point.
 I would have to start small and expand as I go. Just working on thinking through the mental model. I plan to start working on reading the org manual, any other recommended resources would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have looked at the syntax of the org-mode table but I haven't found a way to add percentage proportions on each field. For example assuming my table has 3 fields - name, assgn1, assgn2 and I want to sum the assignments (assgn1, assgn2) but each one has a different gravity, for example, assgn1 65% the other 35% so both sum to 100 but with different proportion. I have tried unsuccessfully, given my understanding but not with much luck: TBLFM: $5=vsum($2/(100\*65)..$4/(100\*35))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a working(!) org-capture extension for org-protocol. It's Firefox-only at the moment but I'm happy to accept patches to support Chromium based browsers. I wrote it because none of the current extensions/bookmarklets were all that usable (security popups, no hotkeys, etc.).
 Features include:
  
Hotkeys. One for storing links, one for capturing the page (or selected text, if there's a selected region).
 Context menu items for capturing: 
 A link to the current page, along with a description pulled from the page's metadata.
 Selected text. Optionally, selections can be captured as HTML. You'll want to use this with something like org-protocol-capture-html to translate the HTML to org mode.
 Media (images, video, etc.). Media can be (optionally) downloaded (through your browser's download manager) before capturing.
 
 A browser action button to perform some default action on click (can either store a link to the current page, or initiate a capture).
 Optionally, capturing a selection will capture the HTML itself. You'll want to use this with something like org-protocol-capture-html to translate the HTML to org mode.

 Does anyone know what are the closest alternatives to functional scala using cats effect or zio?
 Do any other languages (that companies hire for) allow the same effect driven monad\IO FP style? 
 From what I've seen, haskell is the closest alternative, but I was wondering if there are others I'm not aware of.
 I really like the style of developing that scala with cats effect\zio allows, but I think it might be a good idea to look into another language(s) that encourages this style\methodology too, in order to increase the amount of potential companies I can apply to. 
 Many thanks.

did you experimen with the feature ? 
 what do you think of it ? 
 any lib using them rn ? or example projet ? I would be extra interested in error handling examples 
  
I've started playing around with boundaries and breaks for the fun of it with the objective of implementing an async/await ( but I guess dotty-cps-async existing and looking great kinda killed my motivation ^^ ) and making scala more Rust-like with Result<E, A> and "nice" ( all a matter of perspective folks, don't burn me to the stakes yet ) overloadings with .? and .! . Very rough right now though
 I'd welcome any suggestion if you have a lookt at mine, and would very much like to see yours !

 It begins from first principles, i.e. the motion of the players and the ball rather than from some existing statistical analysis of football. The idea is instead to work backwards from those statistical models and tweak the physical parameters until something approximating the real game of football emerges. I hope that this approach sets the simulation up for success as the application of data and analysis to football evolves and better statistical measures of success become increasingly available.
 Motivation
 There are clearly a number of existing football simulation games that are wildly more advanced and capable than this simple hobby project. The closed source and commercial nature of these alternatives makes f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working in Python on a script that presents a history of zettelkasting in a table. It shows notes created each month—a fascinating look at how time has impacted zettelkasting. I'm into quantitative analysis, and this was fun learning a few tricks in Python.
If your Zk is file-based, uses a UID as part of the file name, like 202306XXX..., and you have Python and dependencies installed; it should work for you.
You can clone the repo and contribute if you want.

 against my expectations, I have oauth2ms working in retrieving my mails using mbsync. After much finagling it works as advertised. But msmtp, not so much. I can send mails via thunderbird and k9 using office365 smtp and oauth , but msmtp says no.
 Does anybody have some tips to throw ny way perhaps ?
 thx. S
 edit: yes, yes it is possible:
 ``` defaults tls on tls_starttls on logfile ~/.cache/msmtp.log
 account mymail host smtp.office365.com user xxx@xxx from xxx@xxx tls_certcheck on auth xoauth2 passwordeval "oauth2ms -e xxx@xxx" port 587 tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt ```
 turns out, I had the token stored with encryption and forgot to add the -e xxx@xxx argument....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I watched a video where it looked like the youtuber was using XEmacs (it was not the topic of the video, so it wasn't mentioned), so I went to XEmacs site to see if there had been any updates, and it turns out, there was a release around a month ago!
 I had used XEmacs in the early 2000s, before Emacs 21 or 22, don't remember. But one of the things I liked more, was that help buffers and other popup windows, get focused straight away, so they are easier to navigate and to close, just by using the normal movement keys and q. I always thought it was much nicer than the default in GNU Emacs, where the popup window is not focused so you use C-M-v and C-M-V to scroll it and C-x 1 to get rid of the help window.
 After a short period of XEmacs, I brought with me that XEmacs behavior for help buffers to GNU Emacs. I've been doing that for more than 20 years.
 Well, from the XEmacs changelog: 
  
Improve: Help buffer behaviour synced with GNU (Mats Lidell)
  
I laughed so hard :D

 New in this issue:
 - support for boundary/break API, which was introduced in Scala-3.3.0
 - changed API for custom monad contexts -- now monad context should provide an instance of monad with possible intercepted operations instead await interceptor. This is needed for unification with context-encoded direct style, where we can have no await-s. [And last relative significant change, for which we had kept the '0.x' versioning scheme].

 I have org-src-preserve-indentation set to t because to get the proper alignment of my code when writing it, but I figure that it also causes the misalignment of the src contents w/ respect to the begin/end delimiters.

 I am wrassling with outlook365 and I want to move from thunderbird to mu4e and I have finally been able to get mbsync to login and download the mails. However, with thunderbird I have set up an Archives/[YEAR] subfolders structure that I have used for years with my personal mail that also works as advertised in mu4e.
 But with outook365 I get :
 IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Archives/2022 (reserved character '/' in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Archives/2023 (reserved character '/' in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Calendar/Birthdays (reserved character '/' in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Calendar/United States holidays (reserved character '/' in name) 
 Which I thought/expected to be flattened into Archives.2022 like in my personal setup.
 This is the relevan mbsynrc snippet: ``` IMAPStore outlook-remote Account xxxxxx PathDelimiter "."
 MaildirStore outlook-local Path ~/Mail/outlook/ #trailing / is important ! Inbox ~/Mail/outlook/INBOX
 Flatten "."
 Subfolders Verbatim
 InfoDelimiter "_"
 Channel outlook Far :outlook-remote: Near :outlook-local: Patterns * INBOX* Create Near Expunge Near SyncState * Sync All ```
 Does anybody have some tips or tricks up their sleeve perhaps ?
 thx S

 As part of my Master thesis, I would like study some of Akka's internals, i.e. the code machinery that allow actors and Behaviors to work.
 I am aware of the Actor Architecture's documentation, but I am looking for something different:
  
What are the most important components that allow an actor to come into existence and communicate with others? How do these components interact?
 When an actor does a tell, what components does the message go through until the receiving side processes it?
  
I examined the source code a bit; my understanding is that the ActorCell class is crucial; however, being an implementation component that is not to be touched by users directly, it is not covered by the user documentation. Similar reasoning for the ActorRefProvider class.
 Up until now I have found this resource (it provides a very useful component diagram); I am looking for similar resources, and possibly more comprehensive ones.
 Any resource would be helpful (even conference talks). Thanks for your inputs.

 I currently use Monospace Bold and am quite happy with it. But I looked at a font recently on another post here , and liked that as well (image below). Can someone tell me which font that is? And also, if you have any suggestions based on my taste above, please recommend me fonts to try out (if possible with the lisp code on your init.el so that its easy for me).
 P.S. I also like the red code font used on reddit here

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I messed with my Emacs config recently and uninstalled some Clojure-related packages (clojure-mode, clojure-mode-extra-font-locking, cider) from a couple of years ago. I decided I wanted to explore Clojure again but now, when I run cider-jack-in, if I type an expression and hit Enter, it just creates newlines repeatedly, but does not evaluate.
 I have tried some troubleshooting steps, but have not had any success. What I've tried so far is:
  
Clear out ~/.emacs.d/elpa and let the packages install fresh.
 Upgrade leiningen (with brew on macOS), start a new Clojure project and core.clj file and try to jack in to that. (Has the same behavior.)
 Enabled logging for nrepl-server. No errors are logged.
  
Interestingly, if I run C-x C-e next to an expression in core.clj, it evaluates normally, but the REPL no longer works.
 Could you please suggest more troubleshooting steps or a possible fix? I am running EmacsforOSX version 28.2. I searched the web but have not yet found someone who encountered this same problem.
 EDIT: formatting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, 
 I found the following in Section 16.10 of the Emacs Lisp Info Manual for Emacs 28.2: 
 "Normally, well-designed Lisp programs should not use with-eval-after-load. If you need to examine and set the variables defined in another library (those meant for outside use), you can do it immediately—there is no need to wait until the library is loaded."
 Some obvious exceptions to setting variables "immediately" spring to mind, such as modifying a library's keymaps with define-key(). The keymaps must already exist, of course, which happens only after the library is loaded. I don't doubt that the manual authors had situations like that in mind with their beginning caveat, "Normally . . ." 
 But more generally: what if the library, upon loading, overwrites -- with its own default values -- the values the user had earlier set? 
 It seems to me that it's safer to put all setq()s and whatnot into with-eval-after-load and be done with it. Or are there benefits to the blunter "don't bother waiting" approach that I'm missing? 
 This comment from the Info Manual is tormenting me: I would sooner die than write an ill-designed Lisp program!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit. More background information here. The recent "Ask Me Anything" session with the CEO of Reddit didn't really address the concerns of people, and some subreddits decided that they would shutdown indefinitely.
 I think /r/haskell as a community should be discussing what action to take. On a personal level, this subreddit is pretty dear to me, as it has been my go-to place to keep up to date with the Haskell news over the years, and has been an invaluable source of information when I first started learning the language. So I guess my (kind of open-ended) question is: what is the stance of /r/haskell regarding the events happening on the broader Reddit? I am aware that a bunch of communities are migrating to some federated, open-source alternatives, most popular being Lemmy. Would us as a community consider such a mass exodus? The admin of functional.cafe, a Mastodon instance for the FP community, has recently been gauging interest in spinning up a Lemmy instance, maybe some arrangement could be made through cooperative effort?
 I have created this thread to hopefully seed some useful discussion surrounding these. I am looking forward to hear what the community thinks in general.

Tasks - personal tasks
 Work - for work tasks
 Config - for tasks related to updating my config
 Game Design - tabletop game design tasks
 Programming Study - for learning / growing my programming knowledge
  
You get the idea. Each of these have a filetag so that everything is tagged and I have use categories for top level task types i.e. tasks/meetings/reminders etc (this lets me use category icons)
 The issue I have is for negative filtering. Say I want to filter out JUST my work and config tasks for say the weekend when I can work on a variety of personal projects.
 The documentation (here) states:
 C-u / Hide entries matching a tag. You can successively call this command to hide several tags. 
 If I call this and use Work it filters out work options. I call it again and the prompt is pre-filled with the text "-work" if i change it to "config" then work comes back. So I though maybe it should be "-work-config" when i do this it removes config but brings back work. I'm at a complete loss on how to apply multiple negative filters.
 I've also tried using \ for the Tag filter only mode not the more universal / filter. There same thing if I exclude work and run \ again and exclude config it brings work back

 Documentation on the native android port is hard to find; searching tends to give me decades old stack overflow questions and lots of info about termux.
 Are there good docs about configuring the Android port?
 Maybe the ideal at this point would be just to be able to point the native port to the .emacs.d I have already set up in termux, if there's a way to do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently using Debian-stable, known for its reliability. However, packages in the Debian repository tend to become outdated over time. Therefore, I chose to download the Emacs source tarball and compile it myself, which was successful. Recently, I came across the Guix package manager, which can be installed on Debian. Based on my research, guix install emacs installs Emacs in its own environment without requiring sudo access. This approach seems to reduce the likelihood of future dependency issues and makes package management easier. Is my understanding correct?
 I also observed that GUIX installed a daemon of some sort. I'm curious if this daemon consumes a significant amount of memory, considering it runs in the background continuously.
 Is it possible to install Emacs using GUIX while allowing the management of other packages to be handled by "use-package" as in my old configuration?

Using ! replaces all further matches in the buffer. So if there are matches in 100 files, you have to hit ! in each one. Is there a sort of super-! which says "replace all further matches in all further files"?

 As you can see, all habits are grouped together at the bottom (even though morning habits start at 10am). I want it to show morning habits at the top at the correct position. How can I do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helm is useful in most cases, but it is sometimes very annoying because it doesn't let me put what I want, maybe because it's not in the list. Sometimes helm lets me do that by choosing question mark [?], but that's not always the case.
 One example I experienced today. I'm using spacemacs with helm. I did find-file to a remote directory with TRAMP. So I'm in dired. From there I put M-x shell and it asked me the remote shell path. The default shown in helm text area is "/bin/sh" which is a reasonable default. But helm does not let me press enter there. So I can't open a remote shell.
 I thought there would be a way to just force put "/bin/sh", but I couldn't find any ways. C-f, C-z or whatever didn't work. I'm pretty surprised that helm does not have any unified way to fallback if there are no ways for a mature feature that existed such a long time.
 BTW, for that specific issue, I solved it with this elisp code, but I'm still curious if there's a way to fallback on helm.

 There is a quarto-mode, unfortunately it is not being actively developed (and my elisp skills are not good enough to submit meaningful PRs).
 Personally, I was unable to get quarto-mode to work for me as-is. The quarto-preview command does not work for me as it does not pick up the correct virtualenv, not even with pyvenv. Hence, I started to code up my own custom quarto-preview function, and continued to further write up some really basic elisp functions to make it work for me.
 My setup is summarised here: https://gist.github.com/fast-90/3d7ce3252fff59b0f6d6d1bcadcf4938
 Basically my workflow is (I only use it with Python):

 However, Akonadi (the PIM suite from KDE) is pretty unreliable. I'd like to interact with CalDAV and CardDAV from desktop nicely, but it really hangs more often than not. Is there a way to achieve this with Emacs?

 links appear as download:<PATH-TO-FILE> instead of file:<PATH-TO-FILE>. Then they don't display correctly unless you manually change that url to file:.
 I assume that it must be detecting the file type and at some point decide to use a specific type of url (there is file: in source code, so it should be possible).
 It seems that by default org-downlaod just uses the standard org-mode's attachment mechanism. The question though is why doesn't changing org-download-method to directory switches it to a "download" url type.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If anyone is interested, I've created an Atom backend for Gnus, which can be found here.
 I posted it to the Emacs development mailing list, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like there's much interest in it currently.
 The only major remaining issue with it is that it doesn't use Gnus' inheritance system, since I keep running into weird issues trying to implement it. If anyone is interested in helping with this I can provide more details. This doesn't affect usage at all, but it kinda sucks because I designed the backend to be very modular so it would be simple to quickly build custom backends.
 To use it, add (or browse) Atom feeds as servers, with the address being the URL of the feed (without a "http://" or "https://" prefix due to a limitation with how Gnus parses group names in some cases unfortunately). For example:
 (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '( nnatom "somewebsite.tld/feed.xml" (nnatom-name "<optional custom name for the group>"))) 
 Each "server" will contain a single group with a name taken from the feed or 'nnatom-name'.
 Some design notes:
  
Atom feed entries (articles) can contain both a summary and "content" (or both, or neither). nnatom saves both, and allows viewing either by making the article multipart when needed.
 Every piece of data extracted from the feed is handled by a separate function, and all Gnus backend interface functions are generic, which allows very simple creation of derivative backends theoretically (you only need to implement a set of parsing functions for your feed).
 Every feed has it's own file for data storage, and those are the only files modified directly by nnatom.
