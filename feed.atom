 I use org-mode for a couple of years already. And it's a great productivity tool.
 The only disappointment for me is its logo. It looks like a bad drawing from a child. 
 I don't think it would be hard to find someone willing to design a logo. I know the important part is the tool itself but still, a good logo will bring more people to org-mode (and emacs in general).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently I put everything I can inside of a use-package statement. This keeps everything tidy, but sometimes I'd rather have more flexibility in how I organize things.
 I am considering structuring my emacs init in a more programmatic way, like this (from top to bottom):
  
Global constants (e.g. fonts or any other variables I want to quickly access) 
 Functions which group related configurations together (by e.g. version control, programming, UI, etc)
 Followed by a main() type function that runs all of my configuration functions.
  
I feel like this would massively improve the modularity of the setup. Has anyone done something like this? Or I would be open to hearing other solutions as well.

 I also plan to read Org manual and later the Emacs manual later (would skim it just for completeness's sake cause I think elisp is the heart of emacs)
 I'd love to know which you have read, how long it took, and how good it was or wasn't; did u take notes? and how much you still remember
 I'd also don't mind the input of those who haven't.

 I can successfully create a buffer named *today* which displays today's journal file (e.g. 2021-09-17.org). What I'd like is, instead of the filename being displayed in the bottom of the window, to have the buffer name *today* displayed there (instead of what can be seen here). I'm sure this is possible, but my time searching for a solution was less than fruitful.
 This what I've tried so far:
 (defun my/whatever () (interactive) (let ((filename (format "%s/%s.org" org-daily-dir (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")))) (progn (find-file filename) (rename-buffer "*today*") (org-mode) (display-buffer "*today*"))))

 For example, let's say our compiler project has Analyzer module that has Analyzer.Common and Analyzer.Combinators modules in it. When a new developer looks at the codebase and is about to use Analyzer module in some other part of the compiler, the question is: are they supposed to import only Analyzer, or are they allowed to also import Analyzer.Common or maybe Analyzer.Combinators?
 I would say that often we want the rest of the code to import Analyzer module, while the rest we regard as implementation details of that whole module tree.

 So basically I built a service A that operates on some entity (CRUD with sql DB) and I expose kafka messages on every operation over the entity but everything is built on proto
 eg
 proto - rpc createCart (createCartRequest) returns (createCartResponse) { ... }
 scala - def handleCreatReauest (CreatCartRequst) : CreateCartResonse
 Now I need to create a different service that can at least do thing like CartService.createCart(CreatCartRequst(id="myId")) but ideally whould also have an ability to consume kafka messages as if it knows about the protos thear schema was generated from
 What do I do? Things I read on SBT and protos didn't explain this

 My problem is that in all of my other shells I use C-u very frequently. I guess I do things like kill-backward, then type other commands, and then paste the killed text, etc.
 In term/eshell I can use C-c C-u to do this, but I don't want to build the unconscious habit of sending a SIGINT when I tab over to Bash.
 Is overriding C-u for esh-mode a reasonable thing to do? Will this come back to bite me when I become more proficient in Emacs?
 EDIT: Well, here's what I put in there. I'm still getting used to the half-dozen ways of keybinding. Both seem to work!
 (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook (lambda () (define-key eshell-mode-map (kbd "C-l") (lambda () (interactive) (eshell/clear-scrollback) (eshell-send-input))))) (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook (lambda () (define-key eshell-mode-map (kbd "C-u") 'eshell-kill-input)))

My colleague thinks it's because fail was finally removed from Monad in GHC 8.8 and I think that's probably why, which means there is no longer a fail instance for ((->) r) (which shows up in the error message in the second notebook linked). Can anyone confirm that that is what's happening, and if not, what is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want a pretty light text editing experience, I'm not in computer or data science and just need to use Python for some basic data analysis work so a full-fledged IDE is a bit much for me. Emacs' regular python-mode lacks some features I would regard as essential for my experience, and I'd rather ask around about it first before giving up and resorting to an IDE.
 Running Fedora 34 and GUI Emacs.
 Here are the features I am looking for in a python IDE:
 - Running code cells individually (Spyder creates a cell whenever you type #%% on a new line).
 - Being able to view image output (e.g. from matplotlib) within Emacs. This is the biggest one for me besides code cells.
 - Running a .py file from within the python-mode buffer, to be shown in another window (currently have to do C-c C-c C-x o to enter any requisite input and I would like to at least auto switch focus when I run C-c C-c if I need to provide input)
 - A variable value tracker like Spyder has (a window or screen where I can see the currently held values of the script's variables)
 - View documentation for functions defined within the script on hover (Python documentation itself seems to be supplied by Eldoc though I must admit I don't exactly know how to get it sorted), to be clear I mean the documentation you write into the script yourself right after defining a function. This is optional since it's so complex.

 I'm currently tasked with trying to maintain several Scala Spark scripts. I'm hoping to use some SAST tools to look for issues to resolve. The GitLab SAST scanners use spot-bugs, which I've found to not catch anything. I tried using Sonarqube, which has caught a few things but missed a bunch of SQL injections.
 For context, code is mostly ETL scripts. Lots of SQL injection risks, not in a good position to add unit tests.
 Thank you in advance!

 MD icons not shown on emacs
 I recently installed Doom emacs, and have an issue with displaying Material Design icons. After some reasearch i found out that set-fontset-font command can be used to force a font for a particular set of characters. I added the following to my config
 (set-fontset-font "fontset-default" '(#xF0000 . #xF182F) "Material Design Icons") 
 I think the range covers all the recent icons too, but I still can't get them to be shown properly.
 When I use "describe-char" to check which font it's using I get the output as "display: no font available" 
 Am I doing something wrong or is there some other way to fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s Helm, Ivy/Counsel, Selectrum, Ido, etc. 
 How does one find a good list of completion frameworks? 
 Lately I’ve been thinking of trying different ones. I’ve been a Helm user since I started using Emacs (at the time the only choices were Helm, or Ido related packages). 
 I don’t ever take advantage of Helm specific features - I just started selecting multiple buffers a week ago. It makes me think that maybe I should check out other frameworks. 
 I’ve been interested in the Ivy family of packages because counsel-company looks great! I’m also a fan of counsel-Etags (https://github.com/redguardtoo/counsel-etags) especially since you can define your own command to use for tags (like replacing crags with ripper tags). 
 (I’m also a big fan of binchen in general, I love his Emacs usage and philosophy).
 Anyway - what completion framework do you use and why? I’d love to learn more and try each one out.

 Is there an option that I can use inside the custom-theme-set-faces form?
 for example like '(font-lock-string-face ((t (:foreground "#d7d7af"))))

Announcing Evoke, a GHC plugin for deriving type class instances quickly by Taylor Fausak
I’m excited to announce Evoke, a GHC plugin that automatically derives type class instances without using generics or Template Haskell.
Deferred Derivation by Matt Parsons
Freeing a module from Template Haskell speeds up our build tremendously - not because Template Haskell is slow (it’s very fast) but because compiling at all is slow. The best way to speed something up is to spend 0 time doing it — don’t do it at all!

 capture template code:
 .........
 ("b" "Books" entry (file "~/.emacs.d/OrgFiles/books.org"
 "* %(let* ((url (substring-no-properties (current-kill 0)))
 (details (org-books-get-details url)))
 (when details (apply #'org-books-format 1 details)))")
 ​
 Now here is the output I am getting once select/press "b" from capture menu ...in the capture buffer it is showing this :
 %![Error: (void-function org-books-get-details)] 
 ​
 Now, here is the actual code in the org-books.el :
 (defun org-books-get-details (url)
 "Fetch book details from given URL.Return a list of three items: title (string), author (string) andan alist of properties to be applied to the org entry. If the url is not supported, throw an error."
 (let ((output 'no-match)
 (url-host-string (url-host (url-generic-parse-url url))))
 (cl-dolist (pattern-fn-pair org-books-url-pattern-dispatches)
 (when (s-matches? (car pattern-fn-pair) url-host-string)
 (setq output (funcall (cdr pattern-fn-pair) url))
 (cl-return)))
 (if (eq output 'no-match)
 (error (format "Url %s not understood" url))
 output)))
 ​
 What is going wrong...I am not able to figure it out. I am sure , that I haven't change the file to something else.
 Shed some light.

 Some of our devs are also Haskell devs and if you have a job post to share we can help you share as many jobs you want at our platform also.
 You can see our website here and it is totally free currently.
 You can find some Haskell jobs from our website here.
 We don't have a Haskell job from a real user yet so would appreciate if you share some and can help you find a candidate also,
 It would be greatly helpful also if our first blog post is by a real Haskell developer instead of sharing that first ourselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved away from a hand-rolled configuration and switched to Doom not long ago. After several years of basic functionality, I suddenly found myself with multitudes of modules all loading much faster than my previous config. I couldn't believe I'd waited so long.
 And then it all came crashing down. I found org-spec, which I absolutely want to use professionally. But ob-ditaa... My understanding is that if I set a variable, defcustom should leave that alone. This isnt' happening. Perhaps then (after! ob-ditaa ...) will override the default and I'll be able to export.
 Please, help me set this in Doom so I don't have to evaluate it each time.
 I have tried this:
  (after! ob-ditaa ;; I've tried org here as well (setq org-ditaa-jar-path (dt/trim-last-newline (shell-command-to-string "which ditaa")))) 
 And, actually, ditaa is on my path, so I've done this as well:
  (setq org-ditaa-jar-path "ditaa") 
 This is in my .doom.d/config.el. And when Emacs starts, that's what it is set to, but when I dispatch to export, it's set back to the defcustom specified in ob-ditaa.el.
 I did search far and wide for someone with a config that has this. I've found a few, but nothing seems to work.

 After drop emacs and change to vim. I love so many features in vim, but feels kind of incomplete after using emacs. So, returned to emacs and try it again.

Support for ghc 8.10.6 and 8.10.7
 The ormolu formatter plugin works with ghc 9.0.1
 Call hierarchy plugin has been improved thanks to @July541: 
 Add call from type signature
 Add call from a function pattern
 Go to typeclass instance directly
 
 As usual @isovector has been busy improving wingman plugin: 
 New "intro and destruct" code action
 Streaming tactic solutions: when Wingman times outs, it can still pick the best solution it found
 Let-bindings in metattactics: allows you to bind variables in tactic metaprogram
 Several bug fixes
 
 We have new docs thanks to @michaelpj: https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io
 Now you can ask the executable for included plugins with: haskell-language-server --list-plugins
 There are several bug fixes and features you can found in the merged pull requests list
  
https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/releases/tag/1.4.0
 DEPRECATION NOTICE
  
After this release we will drop support for ghc versions 8.6.4, 8.10.3 and 8.10.4 
 The advise is upgrade ghc to the last minor version: 8.6.5 or 8.10.7
 Take a look to this issue for more details

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Repost due to getting some details wrong in the original title.
 Also, actually, the command doesn't fail: it interprets d 10 as C-u 62-, so d 10 j is read as C-u 62 j, and instead of deleting 10 lines below point, we instead jump 62 lines down. d 20 j is interpreted as C-u 72 j, d 30 j as C-u 82 j, and so on (unless there are multiple 0s in the command; for instance d 100 j is read as C-u 620 j).
 Here's the init.el needed to reproduce this issue; just open a buffer and activate evil-org-mode, then do any evil command with a 0 in the digit argument: y 10 j, d 10 k, y 30 l, etc.
 I discovered that this is due to this line in evil-org-mode; commenting it out removes the issue. However, I'm not sure why that is; what it's attempting to do makes sense to me, and it seems to be identical to what evil itself does.
 I'd use edebug, but I'm not sure if that's possible since the result of the evil-redirect-digit-argument call is just a wrapper of a lambda that I don't know how to step into. Besides, evil-redirect-digit-argument seems to be being used correctly from what I can tell.
 Does anyone know what's causing this issue or how to fix it? I'm super curious.

 Problem description is exactly as mentioned in https://www.codewars.com/kata/5cf3e6d3c6c7fc00269fc475/scala. For brevity, I am not posting the complete question. Gist is to implement *f* such that the following pass compilation.
  assert(f(Some(42)) == 47) assert(f(Some(-35)) == -30) assert(f(Option.empty[Int]) == 5) 
 I tried the solution with method overload as below. Code compiles and works as expected but I am curious if there is any way this would not compile or run.
 //My solution object Main extends App { assert(f(Some(42)) == 47) assert(f(Some(-35)) == -30) assert(f(Option.empty[Int]) == 5) def f(x: Int): Int = x + 5 def f(x: Option[Int]): Int = x match { case Some(v) => f(v) case _ => f(0) } }

 Has anyone had experience in using a dedicated display (an iPad, a tablet, or a small standalone monitor) to always display the org-agenda view? I would like to constantly have it in view, but I'm not sure where to start with setting this up. I have a macbook pro and an iPad, but I would prefer not to use a separate app like BeOrg, since I'm very used to looking at the agenda as I've configured it.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something I did broke magit, many of the commands don't work anymore, for example C-n, C-p don't move me around in the status window (but plan n and p do...) and more importantly I can't trigger a rebase from the log. 
 Whenever I try any of the above I get an error: Symbol's value as variable is void: project-switch-commands. 
 I'm looking into it but I figured I'd post a question in case someone just knew the answer, it's impeding my ability to work :(
 My config is here if it helps: https://github.com/jgerman/jjgemacs/blob/master/settings.org

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing some recreational writing using org-mod. I like it so far. Great. I think I've gotten best results using pandoc to create a PDF, but the results are beautiful. I could do the same from within emacs I'm sure.
 I have one file per chapter, which is natural and works for me. I can maybe be dissuaded. I think every file wants a `#+TITLE:`, at least because pandoc requires it or complains. If I output "one chapter" (file), everything looks great. The (chapter) title looks just the way I like it.
 If I do the following with pandoc:
 pandoc -s *.org -o my_book.pdf 
 The problem is that the titles of the chapters end up all mashed together at the top of the document. Everything is more or less perfect.
 Should I maybe just not do this and manage this as one big doc, using hideability to deal with the unwieldiness? I could be convinced.

  (use-package windmove :bind (("C-S-j" . windmove-left) ("C-S-l" . windmove-right) ("C-S-i" . windmove-up) ("C-S-k" . windmove-down))) 
 However, in org buffers, the C-S-i binding gets overwritten. I can not figure out how it is being overwritten. It seems like it is doing org-cycle global as it will cycle all headers in the file. When I do C-h k I get this: 
 ``` S-TAB runs the command org-shifttab (found in org-mode-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘org.el’.
 It is bound to <backtab>, S-TAB, <S-tab>, <S-iso-leftab>, <menu-bar> <Tbl> <Previous Field>, <menu-bar> <Org> <Show/Hide> <Cycle Global Visibility>. ``` The binding C-S-i doesn't show up in C-h m or C-h b either. The other windmove bindings do show up in C-h b though. When I'm in another buffer with a different mode all of my windmove bindings work fine. It seems to just happen with org buffers.
 I'm really scratching my head as I can't find any smoking gun to what's actually being called or how it is bound.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose : To take clean notes or create a short summary of a webpage (blog, documentation etc.) opened in Firefox browser. 
 Which you can refer again in future (e.g. for revision if you are preparing for exams).
 The notes would be saved in org format in your computer (or in cloud, maybe) so that the user can customize it and print it as well (or even save in a presentation format).
 
  
​
  
Working : How it works is basically when you are reading a blog post- 
 An org file for that page would be created.
 You will highlight the text and a popup button will appear.
 When you click it, various options appear like 
 send the selected text as heading or paragraph to org file, maybe send image and various other features that a sane reader requires.
 
 Live edit the org file
 
  
​
  
Tools : Things to make this project happen 
 Firefox extension would be created using JavaScript.
 Emacs daemon can be used to view the file live.
 
  
Now I am a little confused right now and need your suggestions on this, to make this happen or not, as I don't know the feasibility of this project.
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to add the todo state of a heading which is an org-roam node to the org-roam-node-find UI (so I can easily search for each state I have defined from that menu). To my understanding, the cl-defmethod macro which I need to use to do this, needs a variable which holds this value, so I can display it on that UI. However, I cannot find such a variable, besides org-state (which seems to only exist to store the new state of an item, when its todo state is changed, which won't suffice I think).
 Have I missed something or does there not exist such a variable. And if not, can anyone think of a different way to add this info to the UI. This would be really useful for me, but I am not the best at elisp, and looking through documentation and variable-lists, I cannot find a solution to this. I know I can search for each state with a custom agenda query using something like org-super-agenda, which I also plan to do, but the ability to search for them inside org-roam-node-find will make it even better for me. 
 Thanks in advance, and please do ask me for it, if I missed any info you deem important for the task!

 Maybe you saw https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/jt5893/looking_for_20_haskell_developers_in_eu/ and thought it’s not current. But it still is! Since the last time we posted this, we have hired 9 Haskell developers (plus three Elm devs, to mention other fp roles). But since 9 < 20, we are still hiring!
 Scrive still needs pragmatic, production-oriented Haskell developers. We do a bit of “deeper Haskell” and maintain a few OSS projects, but primarily we build stuff that serves our customers.
 The product is in the e-signing space and this is usually categorized as "legaltech". For me it is more "get the world rid of paper" and "help people reach agreements over distance".
 https://careers.scrive.com/jobs/996814-haskell-developer
 EU residency and work permit is required, as is fluency in English (Norway and Switzerland are fine, UK is not). This part sadly accounts for the majority of rejections we have had to communicate, but we really need these two things.
 We are “remote-first” for developers. I was recruited via this reddit 5 years ago and I am still full remote.
 We need more than 20 people over the next 12-18 months. Don’t be shy :P

 Anyway, for some reason if you open a .hs file with nvim in a stack project, hls will not attach. Instead, try creating a new cabal project, change directory to the "app" folder in it, and open "Main.hs" file with nvim. And for some reason, it's got to be the Main.hs file in app; if you don't HLS will still attach but theres still an annoying error message.
 I have no idea why this works, but at this point, I'm just happy that hls even attached. FWIW, I think the problem has to do with stack getting ghc version wrong. This might help, idk: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/1782

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say I'm typing in a plain text document and I want to insert the name of an emacs or python function without changing the file mode.
 Is there a way to get company or autocomplete to look up functions or keywords in elisp matching what I've typed on a word by word basis?
 This way can type something like buffer and if I hit a hotkey to search for elisp functions, elisp functions matching buffer are offered for selection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I've been writing Emacs lisp, I've obviously come across a good amount of code written in what I'll call the cl style, using cl-lib functions and macros (even cl-defun and the like). I've been putting off using these functions in favor of “vanilla” Emacs forms, though recently I've been noticing the power of the cl-lib tooling.
 Now that cl-lib is built-in to Emacs, I'd love to hear different opionions on whether you use it or not. What are the pluses and minuses of using cl-lib or older parts of Emacs Lisp?

 I wrote a little tool in C that allows you to use normal keys as modifiers.
 I found the other programs that were already providing this functionality either too complicated or not working very well.
 So I thought this could be useful to some of you. I use it every day and I can definitively feel the beneficial effect on my pinky.
 (For the curious ones, my keyboard setup is the following: CTRL on thumbs, CAPS is bound to ESCAPE, and both CAPS and ENTER have ALT as their secondary function. ALT is also on pinkies too, just in case. The "super/windows" keys are either on thumbs (next to CTRL) or palms depending on whether i'm using the laptop keyboard or the external one. 
 For normal remapping I have been using the X config files.)

 Been looking to see if there's a relevant web-mode-function or some variable I can enable browsing them with C-h v (I found "web-mode-enable-auto-closing" and battled with it like one hour wondering why it didn't fold everything, only to find out it doesn't have anything to do with folding, but actually autocompletes matching tags :p it was cool to discover that one though)
 The way it works right now, all tags show unfolded by default, and I set it up to close/open them by pressing tab, but even if I close all of them manually, they just come back unfolded when I close and open the document again, so that's annoying
 If anyone knows how to do this using web-mode that'd be really helpful (soz if I didn't use the right terminology for some stuff, still new to emacs, loving it so far lol)
 (Bonus points if there's a way to have all tags be folded except for <html>, <head> and <body> tags)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It may surprise few but recently I have tried to move my setup from running Emacs in GUI to Emacs running in terminal and it has been rough. With emacs lacking something like vscode-server, it becomes very important for emacs to support terminal mode as first class citizen (to be used in environment such github codespaces etc). Things that don't work for example:
 ​
  
Most themes have poor/non-existant support for terminal. Various things like diff mode etc look pretty bad out of box in some themes (bad as in point of making diff unreadable).
 Out of box for example, flycheck-mode errors don't show up in terminal mode until you hunt down and enable errors to be displayed in margin.
 Since we don't have fringes in terminal, since I was displying bookmarks in fringe, no visual bookmarks either.
 Things like dap-mode etc don't work properly. Again part of this is, lack of fringes in terminal mode.
  
​
 I think having some sort of fringe in terminal emacs will make it better but then it falls to individual mode writers (but I don't know if core emacs can somehow make it easier).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to have a consistent theme across some apps and I'm looking for a way to tangle my conf/css files using color variables but can't figure out how to do it.
 The documentation says CSS doesn't support header arguments, and for conf-mode it's just not mentioned in the list of languages.
 If you have an alternative to achieve this I would appreciate the suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a hard question to ask, because people are used to taking machine integers as primitives, so they don't really get what I'm trying to say. The thing is, all hash functions are designed to be fast in conventional processors. But there are contexts where ints either don't exist, or aren't the most efficient option. For example, zk-snark circuits don't have the usual machine integers, and brainfuck has only inc/dec/if. If you wanted fast hash functions on these environments, it is unlikely that sha2/keccak/blake would perform better than something designed for them.
 I'm particularly looking for a hash function that is efficient on the pure untyped λ-calculus. Without native integers, our best bet is to λ-encode the data, thus, the most powerful primitive we have is pattern-matching. The performance of a hash function can thus be measured/approximated by the amount of pattern-matches it performs. The question is: what are simple hash functions that perform well on such context?
 I've asked this question on Stack Overflow, but it didn't receive attention, which is why I'm reposting here. If anyone has any idea, thought or inspiration, please let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every once in a while I do something -- maybe I hit the wrong key combination, maybe I trigger an error of some kind -- and my window configuration gets completely screwed up. Usuall this means a carefully-configured frame (well tab really) of 3 or 4 windows suddenly gets switched to a single window and displays some other buffer.
 I have just turned on winner-mode, and so far it seems to be helping me recover when this happens. But I would also like to be able to diagnose why this is happening. 
 I have a pretty long emacs-init file and probably I have some bad values configured; in fact, it seems likely to me that there is more than one culprit. I'd love to figure out exactly what is triggering this undesirable behaviour, but I don't know to do this. Like, could I somehow add a hook that logs the name of the function that is forcing the change? Or is there some set of variables that is likely responsible for the issue? I could search my config for those, I guess. 
 Anyway, thanks for the help in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am aware that GUI is not sexy these days, nevertheless it might be interesting how to create a GUI application with Scala.
 Scalqa provides Fx package, which is a wrapper of JavaFx technology. JavaFx is difficult to use because of cumbersome data model, designed more for automated tools, rather than programmers writing logic.
 Scalqa provides observable collections and properties of its own, which are human friendly and are adopted to JavaFx, making codding easy.
 Let's create a simple application "Fri the 13th Explorer", which allows to select centuries, and browse "Fri the 13th" days within.
 import scalqa.{*, given} object Fri13ThExplorer extends Fx.Application(400, 600, "Fri the 13th Explorer."): // Creating UI object View extends Fx.Pane.Split: orientation = HORIZONTAL add(Centuries, 40.Percent) add(Days) // Century Table Definition object Centuries extends Fx.Table[Int]: new Column[String]("Centuries", 100, _.toString + " Century") items ++= 1 <> 21 // Add centuries from 1st to 21st sortMode = \/ // No sorting // Allow multi selection selection.mode = Fx.Selection.Mode.Multiple // Days Table Definition object Days extends Fx.Table[Day]: new Column[Int]( "Year", 50, _.year.number) new Column[Int]( "Month", 70, _.month.number) new Column[String]("Day", 70, d => d.weekDay.tag + ", " + d.number) // On change, re-build days Centuries.selection.onChangeRun { ordering = \/ // Reset ordering items.replaceAll( Centuries.selection.~ .flatMap(c => (c - 1) * 100 <>> c * 100) .map(_.Year) .flatMap(_.days) .filter(_.number == 13) .filter(_.weekDay.isFri) ) } 
 The easiest way to run this example is to "git" samplesFx repository and runMain example.fx.table.Fri13ThExplorer in SBT.
 The GUI will look like:

 Python ones
  
I built my dot-emacs file from a tutorial for TypeScript configuration (TIDE), then added the PHP configuration (Intelephense), and then the Python one.
 I just made it work, because I dont know much about Lisp. But maybe you could help and advise on some redundant or duplicate snippets that can make it better.
 Thank you for your help.

 Terminal 1
 emacs --daemon -Q # Start emacs with default configuration emacsclient -nw . # Start a dired buffer in current directory
 Within emacs navigate to the scratch buffer
 ```

 Terminal 2
 emacsclient -nw .
 then eval the following (quit-window t)

 Expectation
 Terminal 2 client closes back to cli
 Reality
 Both Terminal clients close back to the cli
 Does anyone have any thoughts on why this may be?

I'm looking for a library/package that would provide the drawing functionality for me to minimise development time. I'm thinking of functionality somewhat like Microsoft Visio (e.g. place shapes, connect shapes, move shapes, autorouting of connectors etc.). 
 Are there any libraries/packages either natively or wrapped in purescript? Failing that, are there any suitable javascript libraries I could use through FFI?
 Everything I've found myself is either a dead project, intended for data display (i.e. graphs), static (i.e. closer to MS Paint than Visio) or contains too much functionality (e.g. more general rendering libraries for games or multimedia). I'd rather not roll my own if I can help it :)
 Any help or advice you could provide would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 tldr; I can't see a module for ebay sales / purchases integration, as a hobby buyer / seller that'd be useful for me. Am I deaming or could I cobble something together?
 background
 I've been using org-mode about a year now on all my devices. 
 I'm keen to unlock the customisable power of org, so am setting up things like mu4e (couldn't fathom notMuch)
 what I want to do
 I am a hobbyist who needs to keep track of spend for tax reasons. My accountant said: "treat yourself to a spreadsheet" so that's what I intend to do.
 I basically just have to keep a running total of ebay sales and purchases, which I can run some formulae on at year end. 
 I thought org-tables would be useful for this, and would like to avoid manual entry of the data.
 what I've tried so far
 I've searched for an org or emacs ebay module but not found anything.
 I've researched excel export of ebay data (as a middleman) but not seen anything useful.

 Some devs says
  
Functional code is cryptic, hard to understand so hard to onboard new devs.
  
There is truth to that statement. How do you convince someone like that to use FP? 
 Some say not going to the extreme of FP. Is there any advantages / use cases of going to extreme of FP?
 What benefits you yield by moving to a FP from imperative programming? Please share your experience.

On my Android, I use Orgzly to read the org file. There is syncing between Orgzly and Dropbox, and my computer and Dropbox. Mismatch can happen so I make sure that I only edit 1 version at a time. I can get the notification on my phone from Orgzly, so I can either : check off the task on my phone, or check off the task on emacs. So far so good, but my only source of notification is from my phone, my computer does not give the notifications. Is there a way to make it show the notifications, I only need to show the schedule and time for a todo list? I am using Arch and Dunst is my notification daemon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many articles out there, explaining the famous quote "a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors", but I've only found versions using product categories (, monoidal categories), and join (m (m a) -> m a).
 Is it possible to explain the quoted statement without product categories and join, by using Kleisli composition instead?
 Let a = b = c, functions (a -> b) under composition ((a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> c)) with id (a -> a) form a monoid, and so do monadic functions (a -> m b) under Kleisli composition ((a -> m b) -> (b -> m c) -> (a -> m c)) with pure (a -> m a). I would simply find it nice if this fact could be used for an explanation. :)

However, I find that the commands that I use in a session on the remote shell are not present in future sessions or when I log in to the same machine outside emacs. So what I am trying to achieve is a way to open a shell/term which will save history over multiple sessions as well these history could be accessed when logging in outside emacs.
 I know there is `savehist-mode` but I don't know if it works for tramp sessions and if anyone elaborates on this, that would be very nice.

Often, I have a note (that can be a paper/book I read, or a conversation, or a life event) which I want to appear in several "views." This feels repetitive.

I like to put a link to the book I'm reading in the note file so I can open it when I want to study again. Unfortunately, two things happen that are annoying. The link that I store always has some pdf junk at the end rather than a page number.
 Example: file:~/Library/Written/Medicine/Harrisons_Principles_Of_Internal_Medicine_17Ed_18Ed_19Ed_By_Samerbo/Harrisons19Ed/Harrisons19Ed.pdf::%PDF-1.6^M%\342\343\317\323
 Also, even though it used to open the links in the same frame, but new window, now the links always open the books in a new frame. Is this normal behavior?

 here's my emacs config.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming from a vim + tmux background, the way display-buffer chooses to pop-up or overwrite existing windows can be kind of annoying. At first, I just set display-buffer-base-action to prefer putting buffers in the current window. Then, I started thinking about e.g. help buffers - I actually did want them to pop up sometimes, because I didn't want to have to create a new window, switch to it, and then open help every time I wanted to look up a function. However, after spending an hour working on getting display-buffer-alist to demonstrate my desired behavior, I realized I had created a really similar configuration to the default display-buffer logic.
 At this point, I started to wonder if the problem was just with me - maybe my problem with windows is that I don't grok buffers. Maybe there's a Zen of window management where - when magit appears on top of the mu4e buffer with the commit hash your lead was telling you to look at, or help pops up and squishes the window with your code into a postage stamp - a more seasoned graybeard would react with equanimity, recognizing that carefully cultivated window configurations were ephemeral, but that their contents are everlasting, and be able to retrieve and reorder things without getting annoyed or losing flow.
 Or, maybe display-buffer just sucks. I'm interested to hear what more experienced users think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a beginner and a bit confused about how typeclass names, like Functor or Monoid, are used in speech.
 To make my question more concrete, consider the following examples:
  
The set of all values of type f a and the operation fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b together form an algebra (algebraic structure) which is a Functor. An algebra is considered to be a Functor when it has one operation fmap which satisfies certain laws.
 If there exists an operation fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b, then the type constructor f is called a functor.
 The function fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b is called a functor.
  
Which of these sentences are correct?
 My intuition is that the first example, describing an algebra formed by the pair (values of f a, fmap), is the most correct/universal, and similar thing…]]></summary>

 Today when trying to check some checkboxes in an org file, using C-c C-c as I always do it no longer worked. Instead I get C-c C-c- in the Minibuffer, like it is now treating C-c C-c as a prefix key in Org..?
 It seems to be something in my Init files, as it works as expected with emacs -q and then loading same Org file, but I can't for my life figure out what change might have caused this.
 And it seems Org related as C-c C-c works as expected in other modes (i.e. does nothing C-c C-c is undefined in ordinary text file)
 *Sigh* ... Any ideas where I could look?
 
 When asking in r/orgmode it was suggested to try with which-key mode, which I did. But only difference is then I get
 C-c C-c- which-key: There are no keys to show
 in Minibuffer when I do the C-c C-c on the checkboxes..?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a few days I've been experimenting with Anki and SuperMemo (Spaced Repetition Software).
 One thing that is cool in SuperMemo is that I can import a long document and extract a few parts to create flashcards. Although anki-editor can export an org-mode tree to Anki cards, I would need to change all the notes I've taken (with org-roam) and adapt the structure to create cards.
 I thought that the cards should be as close as possible to the notes so I created a special-block called #+BEGIN_ANKI that has other special blocks for the card fields.
 The block looks like this:
 #+ATTR_DECK: Test #+ATTR_TYPE: Cloze #+ATTR_TAGS: incremental-reading emacs #+BEGIN_ANKI org #+ATTR_FIELD: Text #+BEGIN_FIELD {{c1::Observer pattern}} is a Software Design Pattern in which an object, named the ~subject~, maintains a list of its dependents, called {{c2::~observers~}}, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. #+END_FIELD #+END_ANKI 
 I created a package org-mode-incremental-reading that sends this block to Anki (through anki-connect) so I can learn/remember all my notes.
 I'm sharing this package so that it may help someone who also uses org-mode for notes and Anki.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At work, I'm forced to use an old version of Emacs: GNU Emacs 23.1.1.
 Two things about ediff:
 1) I'm using ediff-window-setup-function to be ediff-setup-windows-plain. What I want and expect is to have, upon ediff invocation, two "windows" onto the two buffers being diff'ed that take up almost all of the frame and a one-line "window" for the Control Frame. Instead, I get five windows: the one I invoked ediff from takes a quarter of the frame, a duplicate of that takes a quarter, the Ediff Control Frame takes a quarter, and the two buffers being diff'ed each take an eighth. Yuk! Can anyone figure out how to make this do what I want?
 2) I have noticed that when it has invoked in that ugly configuration, I can get the configuration to the way I want by hitting "|" twice. "|" is bound to ediff-toggle-split. So I tried to work around the issue by doing:
 (defun fix-ediff-windows () (interactive)
 (message "FEW")
 (ediff-toggle-split)
 (ediff-toggle-split)
 )
 (add-hook 'ediff-after-setup-windows-hooks 'fix-ediff-windows)
 but it appears that somehow this hook is not being honored. If I describe-variable on ediff-after-setup-windows-hooks, it does show that it has the value fix-ediff-windows, but upon invoking ediff, there is no message "FEW" and the ediff-toggle-split's are not invoked.
 Can anyone figure out a solution to either issue?

 Compile error:
 /home/elijah/code/monty/src/NewGadt.hs:15:32: error: • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘'Var’ ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: bexprToExpr :: forall (a :: ExprType).

 I would like to do this so certain functions can only work on a specific type of expr, for example:
 printVariable :: Expr Var -> IO () printVariable (ExprVar id) = putStrLn id printNested :: Expr Nest -> IO () printNested (ExprNest inner) = putStrLn "nested expression" printExpr :: Expr a -> IO () printExpr expr@ExprVar {} = printVariable expr printExpr expr@ExprNest {} = printNested expr 
 And of course, calling printVariable with an Expr Nest should fail compilation.
 Is there a way I can have the translate function return Expr a like this? Or is this an inappropriate usage of DataKinds & GADTs?

 Recently started using org-roam at work for taking and organizing notes. Works so far good. However, since the last couple of days I noticed that org-indent-mode (and also some other org-mode keymappings) gets 'deactivated'. It is fixed by just invoking 'org-mode' again, however it is a bit annoying to quite frequently invoke this again and again.
 I am fairly new to emacs but I am trying to learn what happens and why. I am both interested in why this happens but I also want to know how to properly debug this so I can figure out if this is a feature/bug or just a setting I can tweak.
 What I have found out so far is that it is happening whenever I open a node that is not already loaded into a buffer (e.g. if I re-visit a node it doesn't happen). So seems something is happening when 'org-roam-node-find' and later 'org-roam-node-file' ?
 This is not happening on my personal computer but only on my work computer (so far). Using almost identical emacs setup for both, using doom-emacs.
 Anyone experienced anything similar or have some suggestions on how to fix/debug this further?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. After hearing so much about haskell.nix and its cross compilation capabilities, I finally decided to give it a go and try cross compiling some of my projects to arm linux and android.
 Following the guides provided by haskell.nix, I was able to get my projects building with nix, and successfully built some static binaries that ran on my pinephone using the aarch64-unknown-musl target. Unfortunately, I have not had as much success with targeting android.
 I was wondering if anyone has had any success cross compiling their Haskell projects via nix (be it haskell.nix or otherwise) to run on Android. I know there is mobile haskell, and a couple of blog posts out there explaining how to build a cross-compiling GHC manually, but I really like the idea of using nix, as it seems like a more hands-off approach, kind of like Rust's cross It would be especially helpful if anyone had any projects doing this successfully already that I might be able to take a look at.
 Haskell.nix has worked really nicely for me so far otherwise, so ideally I'd use that. Is there perhaps some additional configuration I need to add to my default.nix to get my projects building correctly to target Android? I am still very much a nix noob, so I'm honestly not even sure what sorts of things I can try. Nothing on the haskell.nix documentation seemed particularly relevant to my situation.
 I'm fine with using any relatively recent version of GHC, but I've been trying to accomplish this with the GHC versions listed as supported by haskell.nix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am new to emacs (via doom), so sorry if this is a simple question. I'm looking to edit remote files on a server, but there are two ssh connections required. Essentially, I need to edit files on Sever B, but I must connect to Server A before connecting to Server B. It goes: ssh Server A -> ssh Server B (while in Server A).
 So how could I accomplish this connection within emacs, so I can use my local emacs to edit files on Server B? Is there a package that's used for this or does (doom) emacs have a built in functionality for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With recent changes to The Archive, I've noticed one oddity in my old notes - perhaps worth pointing out.
First, I create a new note using @Will 's Keyboard Maestro macro.  An empty new note looks like:

Now, I noticed when going into older Zettels, that my internal and external references were getting bolded as shown below (this is from the end of a note on "Equality in Death" containing my comments on a Daily Stoic post of the same title):

I found that to get back to the format I was expecting, I had to add a carriage return after the last bit of text (which was not required previously):

From the perspective of The Archive and how it operates, this is a minor, silly item, but the extra bolding bothers me aesthetically and so I find myself obsessively going through old zettles, adding a carriage return near the end.]]></summary>

 Major improvements on the other popular Emacs keybindings extensions are support for multi cursor compatibility, kill-ring being integrated with the system clipboard, rectangle mode, prefix argument, better variety of meta key assignments such as ESC, C-[ and Cmd, mark-ring, s-exp, and others.
 Please forgive the small bit of self-promotion; just wanted to share this with the community as a fellow emacs enthusiast :)

 I've compacted it down into one file of ERT tests that work up until you try to get the variables' local value in a file in the directory I've set up class variables for. I only ever get the default value.
 Anyone have any experience with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've noticed alot of functions behave totally differently when called via M-x vs a regular call vs a which-key call. Specifically I want to create wrappers around some functions to have them do something before or after a function gets called via a keyboard shortcut, but for whatever reason, I either don't get how / what M-x actually passes as variables or the manner in which it is called and what it does differently and then what makes that different vs an interactive which key. 
 I'm on mobile right now, so it's hard to offer examples, but if you know what I'm talking about, please educate me, because I'm not sure what I should be looking for exactly wrt documentation to autodidact it.

 I constantly see people using use-package instead of 'require and stuff. So i did a little research and started to modify my init.el to use use-package. 
 I have got setted various variables about org-agenda , for example:
 (setq org-icalendar-include-body nil) (setq org-icalendar-alarm-time 5) (setq org-agenda-files '("~/path/file.org" )) 
 These are lines at the end of my init.el ; If i want to use use-package for everything i would have to set that variables after a : (use-package org-agenda :init ) ? Or how? Its the same?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I found a blog post a while ago with a really interesting Emacs mode. Can't find it for the life of me, so I'll give all the details I can remember.
 The mode kept 2 buffers in sync, showing the same data in different formats. Edits in either would be instantly converted to the other. For example, inserting an org header "* xyz" in one might add a markdown header "# xyz" in the other.
 It was (in theory) extensible to use any 2 formats that can round-trip convert to one another I think it only supported one pair of formats currently, as a test. I also think it was from a few years ago, maybe 2017.
 The author worked in (computional?) low-level biology, I think DNA sequencing, or something related like blood research. Can't remember if academic or industry. I think they maybe had a post about using Emacs to edit/explore sequence data from RNA/DNA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To what extent could streaming abstractions replace laziness in a hypothetical fully eager Haskell? It seems fairly doable for lists alone.
 Can this pattern be extended to different shapes of data? Let's assume we can still make certain things explicitly lazy if needed, yet we choose to use this sparingly.
 The goal would be to get more predictable behavior.

 (set-register ?p "#+begin_src perl\n\n#+end_src")

 Now , the trouble is , the damn cursor end up at the end of end_src block....which should be in between the block. For instance ..
 #+begin_src perl
 [But the curson suppose to be here or wanted to be here]
 #+end_src [cursor stand here by default]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellow 'macsers,
 TL:DR: I want to use query-replace in an open dired buffer, which considers the file-names of ALL directories and subdirectories present in said buffer. Is that possible? How?
 I am trying to get my music sorted using the beet music library manager. So far, it works quite well. However, I own some more or less obscure music for which there are no proper musicbrainz entries so that the proper tagging/renaming doesn't work.
 Now, I am tempted to simply ignore one source of error - a suffix such as "(Original Mix)" appended to the "ARTIST - TITLE" scheme. This way, I am able to get more tagging done and have less manual work to do afterwards.
 However, I want this problem fixed at a later stage, and I thought I might as well just open a dired buffer, and query-replace should have me covered (in combination with wdired). And it does - provided that I have opened one particular (sub-)directory to which query-replace is then applied. But since I don't know in which directory the "bad" file namings are to be found, I would have to open any and all subdirectories manually for this method to work. Unacceptable (think of Lemongrab in Adventure Time :D)
 Is there a possibility to make dired / query-replace behave in the way that I expect / want them to? Are there other utilities (in emacs or else) that can do what I want?
 Any tips / advice are very welcome. Have a good day, folks!
 EDIT: It seems like I've just been offered two probably working solutions. One includes invoking M-x find-dired RET RET, while the other consists in changing the subdir switch to include -R (in dired, C-u s, then -R). Will test both in due time, but so far, thanks a bunch, u/protesilaos and u/xenodium!
 EDIT2: I've settled with the solution suggested by u/protesilaos. I appreciate when I can stay within the dired interface, and changing the subdir switch seems more intuitive to me.
 Thanks a bunch, folks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider memoization. A monomorphic top level definition will be evaluated only once over the run of a program. So, one can retain the values of an expensive function in a top level map, so that they do not need to be recomputed:
 memory ∷ Map Int Int memory = Map.fromSet expensiveFunction domain 
 However, this polymorphic variant will be evaluated many times — the values will not be retained:
 memory ∷ Num α ⇒ Map α α memory = Map.fromSet expensiveFunction domain 
 This polymorphic definition can be specialized by the compiler for some special cases that can then be retained. Memoization will work only when this specialization is performed. So, disabling optimizations will spell death to a program that relies on memoization of a polymorphic function.
 Are there any other examples of compiler optimizations changing asymptotic complexity?

 Right now, it's 6:25pm. There's an event I scheduled in an org file, from 6:10pm - 7:10pm.
 When I view org-agenda (doing M-x org-agenda, then pressing (a) to view Agenda for current week or day), I want the event scheduled from 6:10pm - 7:10pm to be more "easily viewable"; at the moment it feels hard to tell at a glance what event I should "currently be doing". This is what it looks like right now: https://imgur.com/a/H9sCewg 
 Any tips or advice? Thank you.

 However, while in lsp-mode, company-capf is appended to the front of the list of backends, shadowing those instances of company-yasnippet. From what I understand (and what seems to have worked for this other post facing the exact same problem), the language server should still recommend snippets if lsp-enable-snippet is non-nil, but this doesn't seem to be working for me. Is there something wrong with my configuration, or am I misunderstanding how snippet suggestion works in lsp-mode?

 I know that you can use DEADLINE for tasks to make them show up in the agenda with a warning about the approaching or missed deadline. 
 Can I get the same behavior (show up in the agenda view with a warning some days before the event when the date approaches, basically reminders) with timestamp events (holidays / birthdays / meetings, for example)? 
 I can sort of achieve this when I make the event as and add DEADLINE to it, but I don't really ever "complete" these events, and logically these are not deadlines. 
 Any help is appreciated!

 I wrote this package as a rage-quit of Wordpress, which I'd been using with org2blog. One day it stopped working! And rather than tedium of debugging what latest version mismatch was probably playing up this time, I decided to jump to WP-free and all-org.
 defblog keeps the distinction between posts with categories vs. pages as in WP, reading Org source from a designated source directory. It generates/rsyncs the whole site at each publish, which might be too much for you if you have a truly huge or very frequently updated site. It also generates Atom/RSS feeds and a .htaccess file, the latter with Redirect specs for old page URLs.
 Hope you find it useful; suggestions/feedback/pointing-out-that-it's-redundant/etc. welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's two ways to embed intuitionistic logic into linear logic as described here. The first encodes a -> b into !a -o b. This corresponds to call by name evaluation and is the basis of the linearity via arrows approach linear haskell uses. The second way encodes a -> b into !(a -o b). This way corresponds to call by value evaluation and is the basis of linearity via kinds.
 Borrowing the syntax from the linear haskell paper, here's an encoding of the !(a -o b) embedding of intuitionistic logic.

 This system uses the same context multiplication that linear haskell uses except it places the multiplication on the lambda rather than the function call. This version of let! let here is limited to only work on functions; but it can be generalized to work with a kind based linearity system or a typeclass based linearity system.
 In linear haskell the multiplicity parameter of an arrow chooses between either !a -o b or a -o b. In this system the multiplicity parameter of an arrow choose between !(a -o b) and a -o b. This choose doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. Here's a system that supports both.

 Though I think this isn't worth the extra complexity.

 Problem is still have no clue about testing in emacs (or testing my text editor behavior, for that matter). Is the built-in tools OK or they are obsolete nowadays? Which runner, framework should I use? Any popular assertion libraries? I don't plan to release a package anytime soon, I just want to test once in a while the features I'm introducing. I'm using spacemacs btw.
 Ok, before posting this I looked up a bit and found this and this. Buttercup seems great. Links or tips from experienced developers are welcome.

 I am struggling with defining an encoding for messages written by error on a windows machine (win10, pwsh, chcp 65001, ghc-8.10.* or 9.0.1).
 Consider this MWE:
 module Main where import System.IO import GHC.IO.Encoding main :: IO () main = do hGetEncoding stdout >>= print putStrLn "latin" putStrLn "кириллица 1" hGetEncoding stderr >>= print hSetEncoding stderr utf8 print "set locale encoding" >> setLocaleEncoding utf8 print "set foreign encoding" >> setForeignEncoding utf8 hPutStrLn stderr "кириллица 2" error "кириллица 3" 
 When executing the resulting binary, the resulting output is
 Just UTF-8 latin кириллица 1 Just UTF-8 "set locale encoding" "set foreign encoding" кириллица 2 codepage-exe.EXE: РєРёСЂРёР»Р»РёС†Р° 3 CallStack (from HasCallStack): error, called at app\\Main.hs:14:5 in main:Main 
 The mojibacke looks like as a result of squeezing a cp1251-encoded Cyrillic text into a utf8-expecting terminal. It is clear that inner workings of error are at play here...
 I am out of ideas for now - is there something else that I can try to make them output correct encoding? Or is it hardcoded?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I think I have a challenging issue in front of me, but I might be wrong. The application I'm building needs to handle possibly non-terminating computations gracefully and remain responsive while running them. I thought most of the problem would be solved by running it in a separate thread, but it seems a bit more complicated than that. I want to abort a computation when it's memory usage hits a certain limit. I thought the -M RTS option would work fine for this, but when the program reaches it's memory limit, it just keeps going while memory usage remains more or less constant. However, it seems the application becomes effectively single-threaded for a while before a heap overflow exception is thrown, which makes it very slow to respond. I'm not able to reproduce it with a simple foldr (+) 0 [1..5000000] though, so it's something specific about the computation I'm running. I'm thinking the GC is trying very hard for a while to free enough memory for the computation to continue, which causes a time-frame where other threads are blocked a lot and don't have memory available for them.
 Ideally, I'd like to just keep the application from freezing for more than 100ms while the GC does it's work, because sometimes the memory-intensive computation does complete after entering the single-threaded time-frame and I'm getting the feeling that GHC is a bit lazy about garbage collection while it has enough space, but a way to prevent the unresponsiveness time frame by killing the thread early would also be okay.
 But if someone has a better idea of what's going on here that would be nice already. I can publish the full source if needed, but I think it would quite a bit of work to go through/install the application.
 Edit: Using GHC 8.6.5 (because of GHCJS) if that's relevant

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have some code in C# that I was wondering how it would be implemented in Haskell. I've only written basic Haskell, I'm trying to learn.
 In C#, it's something like this
 var a = GetSomeData(); var b = GetSomeOtherData(); var c = GetFinalData(); var errors = new (bool isError, string message)[] { (a is null, "Could not find A"), (b is null, "Could not find B"), (c is null, "Could not find C"), }.Where(t => t.isError).Select(t => t.message); var error = string.Join(", ", errors); if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(error)) { return Response(error); } // Process data... return Response(...); 
 In Haskell, I was thinking of modeling a, b, c variables as Eithers with either a value (not necessarily of the same type) or a helpful error String. But then I got stuck. Destructuring sounds like a nested nightmare. I don't think I can use a do block because of the different types (right?) and because I want to keep the error messages.
 How could I model the "aggregate and return all error messages, or if nothing's wrong keep processing data" idea. Is there a neat solution?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a (basic) major mode (my first!) for a simple scripting language with its own syntax. So far I've added font locking, comment insertion/recognition, indentation (but only indenting by 4 spaces when using TAB but that is all that is necessary for now as there is no rules to adhere to). 
 Should a syntax table be a defvar or a defconst or does it matter?
 How can I make comments togglable i.e. how can I uncomment a line, region etc.? I can't seem to get that working. If it matters comments can either start with // and end with I guess "" for a single line comment or start with /* and end with */ for a multiline comment. This is specified in my synatx table.
 I would like to add some snippets as the default editor available to us is bundled with snippets for this scripting langua…]]></summary>

 Today when trying to check some checkboxes in an org file, using C-c C-cas I always do it no longer worked. Instead I get C-c C-c- in the Minibuffer, like it is now treating C-c C-cas a prefix key in Org..?
 It seems to be something in my Init files, as it works as expected with emacs -q and then loading same Org file, but I can't for my life figure out what change might have caused this. 
 And it seems Org related as C-c C-c works as expected in other modes (i.e. does nothing C-c C-c is undefinedin ordinary text file)
 *Sigh* ... Any ideas where I could look?

 I figured out how to make wl auto-detect from which SMTP server to send by which folder I am in. But I cannot figure out how to make wl insert the appropriate signature. Google gave me a hack using mu-cite, but surely there must be a built-in way to do this.
 Another thing that bugs me: can I somehow tell wl to ignore its own SMTP capabilities and just use the msmtp I have already set up? Right now, C-x m uses msmtp, while w in wl does something completely different. Obviously, I want them to do the same thing.

 I know there is dfeich/org8-wikiexporters which can export an ORG buffer to valid Tiddlywiki syntax. However I'm searching for more integrations/tipps&tricks how to get best out of both worlds. 
 Tiddlywiki for example has a great REST API which can be used to create/delete content. Using emacs-request I can access that API and create new content (checkout this function inside my dotfiles). 
 I'm looking forward to any other ideas how Emacs and Tiddlywiki could be used together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I'm a student looking to move from Vim to (vanilla) Emacs.
 I'm interested in using Emacs for text editing, task management (TODO, calendar), journalling, notetaking (for school), and some kind of Zettelkasten system (org-roam?).
 What's the best way I can combine all of these?
  
Zettelkasten and school lecture notes separate
 Store lecture notes under the appropriate tag in org-roam along with regular Zettelkasten stuff
 ??? How does the calendar, TODO, and journalling fit in?
  
#1 has the advantage of preventing a overly cluttered Zettelkasten (although one could argue lecture notes could be useful inside it, #2). I might expect some overlap between Zettelkasten content and my lecture notes.
 It's worth mentioning that I'd like to leverage Emacs LaTeX packages as well.
 It'd be useful for me to hear why and how you guys run your Org mode setups, including your use-cases; and I'm sure it would be useful for other users too.
 ​
 Side note: What's a nice way to sync Emacs calendar/TODO across my devices, and to my iPhone?

 I've trying to get stack working on NixOS, and I'm running into some frustrating difficulties. Admittedly the frustration is compounded by my lack of familiarity with Nix, but I feel strongly that I shouldn't require especially in depth knowledge to get a basic stack build going. I installed stack using home-manager, if that's relevant.
 The first issue I run into when running stack build is: 
  demo@nixos ~/D/f/t/w/workshop8 (my_week8_solutions)> stack build error: attribute 'ghc882' missing, at (string):1:43 (use '--show-trace' to show detailed location information)

 Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.
 module BitCounting (countBits) where countBits :: Int -> Int countBits = undefined

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I always seem to run into snags when trying to do anything but the completely trivial with Haskell I/O. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 The problem is this: if I run a computation in a new thread, the memory used is never reclaimed/garbage collected. My test:
 ``` module Main where
 import Control.Concurrent import System.Mem
 main = do test performGC getLine
 test = do _ <- forkIO $ print $ foldr (+) 0 [1..5000000] print "pre" threadDelay (5*106) print "post" ```
 While running this, I monitor the process` CPU and memory usage. It increases until the sum is printed and soon afterwards it prints "post". Then, a GC should be performed, but the memory usage my system monitor reports never goes down.
 I figure I must be doing something weird, because I can't imagine Haskell being what it is without reclaiming memory from finished threads. I hope someone can explain.
 Edit: using GHC 8.6.5

I created some snippets with some fields (with $0, $1 ect) so I can tab between them when completing them. But when I'm in a field, if I have for instance another snippet I want to use, I can't use tab anymore to expand a key, when I press tab, it goes to the next field. How can I solve this problem? Is there a way to change the "priority" of tab? Or should I just change the key to go to the next field?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Emacsers! I've been using some variant of this code for several months (I started writing it quite soon after I began using Emacs) and have found it extremely useful. Maybe you will too. From the readme:
  
Aside is a package written with the aim of making it easy and convenient to use side windows for arbitrary sets of buffers. Specifically, Aside lets you specify a configuration for a window which determines which buffers are displayed in that window, where the window is located, specific customisations that window should have, and defines a ‘do-what-I-mean’ (DWIM) command for navigating to and toggling the visibility of the window, all in less than a dozen lines of code. Much of this flexibility springs directly from Emacs’ built-in ‘display-buffer-alist’ variable, however Aside can make it more convenient to define configurations for ‘display-buffer-alist’ that you can easily separate and use independently from one another, and Emacs does not come with any equivalent to the DWIM commands Aside can generate.
  
It comes with several pre-made configurations, each of which I use extensively myself. Those configurations set up dedicated windows for browsing projects in Dired, making a Vterm terminal always accessible, and ensuring help, search, and compiler warning buffers always show up in the same place. Some of the configurations are a single call to aside-define-configuration, but the Vterm and especially the Dired configuration are a bit more complex. Please try it out if it sounds useful and let me know what you think. If people find this layer of functionality on top of buffer-display-alist valuable, I'm thinking of asking to have it added to ELPA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everybody !
Being a long time lurker of the forum, I'm making my first post here in order to share with you a free, online workshop that I've created. Basically, it's about discovering Joplin  and other software, along with different methods to manage information and organize in our daily lives. Among these methods is the Zettelkasten method; or, at least, what I understand of it.

The point of this post is two-fold: first, I hope that the workshop might make you discover some interesting things that you might use yourself. In particular, I found it interesting to articulate the P.A.R.A method and the Zettelkasten method together, and using open-source software to wrap it all together.
Second, I would really enjoy having your opinion on how the Zettelkasten method is presented in the workshop. I believe that you all know much more about it that I do, along with having much more experience with it. Therefore, if you feel like I've missed some things, or if you think that it could be explained in a better way (since the workshop is designed for people that have never heard of it), I'd be delighted to hear it. You can share it here, or indicate it as an issue on the GitHub repository of the workshop.
I thank you all for all of your fascinating insights about the Zettelkasten method and your use of it; it has always been a pleasure to come here and read about your experience with it.
Have a nice day !]]></summary>

I've never used VS Code before this so I'm already a bit overwhelmed with it. I've mostly been programming with IDEs from Jetbrains where they hold my hand through all the technical terminal stuff, so I'm not very well versed in this, but I'll do my best to assist.
 I'm getting multiple errors with the Haskell extensions, the HLS support one, and Linter. 
 The Haskell (Project1) server crashed 5 times in the last 3 minutes. The server will not be restarted. (Source: Haskell (Extension))

 Cannot hlint the haskell file. The hlint program was not found. Use the 'haskell.hlint.executablePath' setting to configure the location of 'hlint'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I have been working on PEL while learning Emacs, to help me remember commands, organize my Elisp code and to hopefully help new Emacs users get going. 
 It comes with extensive set of topic oriented PDF quickcards, a manual and code that loads (relatively) fast, with init.el and early-init templates, canned customization files; it controls features through customization. Once a feature is identified by customization it will download it, install it and provide key bindings. No Elisp code writing required by users. 
 PEL supports commands to activate package quickstart and implements a fast startup mode that extends package quickstart idea (by bundling packages into one mega package to reduce the load-path) but also available in Emacs 26. With it I have achieved 0.1 second startup for over 200 external packages (244 directories in load-path). More info on the Github page. I'll be adding support for new packages. PEL won't be for everyone but hopefully some people will find it useful. 
 Feedback welcome.
 Cheers :-)

using Gazelle to generate the build files.
Why Bazel?
With Bazel, I get incremental, reproducible, and cacheable builds.
It’s designed for large, polyglot monorepos
and can be extended to support more languages than the many already available.
Why Gazelle?
Gazelle looks at the Go source files and generates Bazel BUILD files for me.
I used tendermint
as an example Go project, because it’s large
enough to include several interesting problems:
protocol buffers
external dependencies
runtime dependencies
flaky and exclusive tests
How will we be able to tell when it’s finished?
At the end, we’ll be able to build targets for all of the Go sources,
$ bazel build //...

run tests,
$ bazel test //...

and execute the tendermint binary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In github, you can link to an issue just by typing #500. Trac had similar auto-link types for linking to source code lines, issues, etc. 
 I'm thinking it would be great for my org-mode notes to have a similar auto-link functionality in org-mode so #500 auto-links to my issue 500. I'd be happy with a text replacement when typing, or dynamic auto-linking (regex triggering a function that returns the link URL). Is there such a thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Collector's Fallacy, which Christian Tietze has written about, is an example of the Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma, also known as the multi-armed bandit problem.  From Wikipedia:

  
The multi-armed bandit problem models an agent that simultaneously attempts to acquire new knowledge (called "exploration") and optimize their decisions based on existing knowledge (called "exploitation"). The agent attempts to balance these competing tasks in order to maximize their total value over the period of time considered.


In the case of the Collector, the "agent" explores indefinitely and adds to their collection but postpones making the decision to do something with it. Wikipedia gives a list of practical applications of the multi-armed bandit problem, but I can't resist pointing out that the problem of deciding which professor's class to take is almost never counted among such lists, perhaps because professors compile them. Someone choosing among Zettelkasten implementations without really settling on one is another.
Given that the multi-armed bandit problem has a name, has been extensively studied since at least the middle of the twentieth century and has been solved in important cases, one question is whether some of these solutions could guide the Collector toward more productive uses of their time.]]></summary>

I hope you can help me. When working on my zettelkasten, I want to link my new permanent notes to old permanent notes, whose number is growing over time, obviously. Because of this large number, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to find an existing permanent note to link with. I wish you could advise me how to make this task easier or how you do it.]]></summary>

 I know that in the org-publish-project-alist config I can specify files to exclude, but I'd like to do something within the file's config itself.
 #+EXCLUDE_TAGS: noexport and #+FILETAGS: :noexport: will omit all content under a heading (but not the content before all headings). The file will still publish, but be empty, which is less than desirable.
 Does anyone know an easy way to exclude files from publication without tinkering with the config?

I think this deserves a discussion of its own, with a more telling title than the one where it came up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dissertation developed a method of specifying the complexity of finite automorphisms (functions from a set to itself). I'd like to extend this to relations (i.e., no restriction that a single arrow departs a particular domain element).
Working with math in my zettelkasten has been interesting. The only difficulty has been with diagrams etc.  I've found that working mainly physically and scanning the images and cleaning the text digitally has been a nice process without much overhead.
Proofs and particularly the elements of subproofs are natural since linking can double as both relation and implication; likewise examination of backlinks can be useful for examining assumptions / presuppositions.
In summary, its working reasonably well, I just need to work physically first, then transfer to digital.
Any shared experiences re mathematics research in your zettelkasten would be great.
For anyone with a combinatorial or number-theoretic bent, here is a newly discovered sequence of numbers generated by the main algorithm of my paper at the encyclopedia of integer sequences. https://oeis.org/A335725]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the Scala website, I'm reading about futures and callbacks. (https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html#callbacks). Here, it mentions:
 In the event that some of the callbacks never complete (e.g. the callback contains an infinite loop), the other callbacks may not be executed at all. 
 I can't think of a situation where the "other callbacks" wouldn't get to run (unless the ExecutionContext is using just a single thread). Even if the never ending callback permanently "occupies" one thread, wouldn't the other threads be able to pick up the other callbacks?
 In what case would a callback that never finishes (infinite loop) prevent other callbacks from ever running in a multithreaded environment?

(If not, it seems unfortunate to not have that functionality factored out).
 I'm returning to lisp after many years, and realizing just how nice it is in e.g. Haskell where you can search for a function signature! Any tips on how to find functionality when (it seems to me that) the APIs are just alphabetic lists of functions mixed with some fairly-reliable naming conventions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if there's a way to have a scheduled meeting marked as a recurring event in my agenda, and then to have notes for each instance of the meeting under that as a subtree.
 Basically, I have something like this:
 * My Meeting <2021-09-02 +1w> 
 And I want a way to turn it into
 * My Meeting <2021-09-09 +1w> ** <2021-09-02> 
 i.e. make a sub-tree for the (non-repeating) current instance of the meeting, in which I can take my notes, and bump the original (repeating) meeting's date by a week (or whatever the repeat interval is).
 Abstractly, a repeating event is an infinite sequence of events. I want to split this into the first occurrence, and the rest of the sequence.
 I've seen that you can do C-c C-t to use org-todo to mark a recurring event as done, but that seems to create a list-item, not an entire sub-tree.
 Is this possible? Am I going about this in the wrong way?

 I’m new to org mode. Is it possible to have multiple directories for org files and org-roam?
 I would like to have my personal org files and notes for org-roam synced with my private Dropbox and all work related org-files and org-roam notes synced with my work iCloud. 
 Can this be done and preferably in a way so that if I would exclude the work org file directory, all my personal notes and todos stay the same. 
 I know that I can define multiple paths for org-agenda-files but I’m unsure of org-roam files. 
 Best regards,
 David

 org-superstar has this annoying thing where there are dots on the bullets.

Several Tweagers all agreed to gather notes here about our
ICFP (International Conference on Functional
Programming) experiences.
Other posts in this series:
ICFP - Day 0

ICFP - Day 3

These notes follow Arnaud, Noon and Richard through their day at ICFP,
roughly in order. (The talks are not publicly posted at the time
of publication of this post, but we expect they will be over the
coming weeks.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Zettelkasten may look something like the image above, where the arrows represent the direction of the links and the boxes a particular kind of Zettel..
Links aren't always bidirectional. E.g.: Let's say I have an overview Zettel on Maria Popova's note-taking method. From this Zettel, I may link to a Zettel explaining how she uses sticky tab notes. But, the latter Zettel might not link to the former.
Another thing to note is that the item in the bottom of the image may link to further details. This might happen when you break down a Zettel that violates the Principle of Atomicity. E.g.:
Topic-based overview: "Maria Popova's note-taking system."
Idea relevant to the overview: "Idea index definition."
A detail of the idea: "Reading is about identifying patterns."
A detail of the detail: "Pattern definition."
I based my diagram on what's been discussed in the Zettelkasten blog, so others' Zettelkasten might look different.
Questions for the reader:
What would you change of my diagram?
How does your Zettelkasten look like?]]></summary>

I'm an 20-year-old female. I have a bunch of mental issues that are either inherent or results of life experience. I love reading - the only thing that keeps me from continuing to read is mental fatigue, lack of sleep. To me reading is a way of escape.
When I acquire new knowledge, I find myself a little more free from all the mental stuff. Sometimes I find myself doing things in slow motion because my brain is reserving energy for processing information.
However I'm not so happy with the amount of info I retain so I have been looking for a way to take better notes and Zettelkasten sounds like what I need! I have been reading about it yesterday evening but I'm still not able to fully grasp this method (I find myself in slow motion again).
But anyways, nice to meet you, everyone!]]></summary>

I feel a bit relaxed as well, because from my timezone (UK) I get a bit

Noon — On Continuation-Passing Transformations and Expected Cost Analysis
Discussion of the difficulty of costing probabilistic algorithms (i.e. you don’t know what it will do.)
Turns out using continuations makes it a bit easier to reason about (I didn’t quite follow the trick that makes it true),
But, it gives a way to think compute average-cost analysis, which seems pretty useful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious if anyone has experience with a dual-zettelkasten format.  So far, it hasn't caused any (major) problems.
If I write a "good" zettle diligently and feel too lazy to rewrite the full note in digital form, particularly a note with lots of diagrams (mathematics, etc) I'll resort to the following...
Workflow: Physical to Digital
Scan the zettle making sure its readable
Create a zettle with the same id and title in digital form
Insert the scan as a large image
Write the header in digital form (using a physical-scan-template) this is quick
Write any links in digital form
Write a one-sentence summary in digital form.
Liberally use NON-hashed tags for keywords in the scanned text for easy searching.
Keep the physical copy and add to physical slipbox
At some point, if I get around to it, I will slowly convert notes that have been post-semi-digitized per the above into purely digital form.
I find the above most helpful when doing mathematics: the diagrams of category theory can take lots of time to write in latex. So if you have a particularly well-formed note with lots of notation, then I've found this method can work out fine in the short-term.  The most important items -- by trial and error -- from above are 5 6 and 7 so as to preserve the ability to search, link, and see a short summary.
Workflow: Digital to Physical (perhaps this is a bit obsessive)
At the end of each day collect the digitally created zettels from that day (easy with timestamp ID)
Print them out 2-per page and cut in half
Add to physical slipbox
Always maintain a printed copy of any index or structure notes.
Now you have a synchronized digital and physical slipbox. Its not perfect but sometimes the good enough, is.]]></summary>

I'm curious how the interplay between sparing use of folders and "types" (a finite small set of tags on the form) -- for example, when taking notes on a book I consider this a buffer note (I use the haskell type syntax ::buffer ) and place it in my /fleeting notes folder. Fleeting contains anything from ::buffer notes to extracted highlights, to temporary documents etc.
This might become a ::literature note if the ideas in the ::buffer note are reworked to be my own (personal reactions -- things it reminds me of etc)
Finally a literature note becomes ::permanent (and goes in the /zettelkasten folder) when I have massaged it (into one or more) atomic, conceptual, not directly derivative -- but still, of course, referenced and possibly linked to …]]></summary>
