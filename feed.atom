        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of you Zettelkasten fans might be interested in an outdated and idiosyncratic program called Literary Machine. You can learn more here:
http://sommestad.com/lm.htm
The program is powerful but far from intuitive, so here are my personal notes about how to use it:
The core items in LM are:
Concept/category words (in the Dictionary pane).
Text items (notes; little boxes in which you write text).
Projects (collections of selected text items).
In a regular outliner program, you add items to a category (in a tree view or hierarchical list); in LM, it's just the opposite: you add categories to an item (similar to tagging with #hashtags. This is true for LM projects, too. You don't add items to a project; you add projects to an item. All of this is done by dragging a concept (dictionary word)…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Actually, I already tried setting it up in VSCode, I installed stack, then a bunch of haskell extensions, then VSCode told me to install GHCup, and then updated extensions and what not and now nothing works.
 Whenever I try running my program with "Load GHCI" I get this kind of message: 
 <no location info>: error: can't find file: Lib.hs Failed, no modules loaded. 
 And when I try executing the default "someFunc" function (which basically prints a string) I get: 
 <interactive>:1:1: error: Variable not in scope: someFunc 
 What's wrong? How can I fix that? Or maybe I should just start from 0? Or even use a different IDE? What do you guys recommend?
 I'm very much fascinated with Haskell, category theory and functional programming, but how can I get into it when I'm unable to execute a simple Haskell program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a way to bypass org-agenda dispatcher (unsure about the terminology here: I'm talking about the buffer you get immediately upon calling org-agenda), and thought of a simple way of doing it. 
 (defun my/org-agenda () (interactive) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list 'my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((view (cdr (assoc (completing-read "Select an agenda view: " my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view nil))) 
 That worked just fine, but I thought it'd be nice to be able to pass restrictions (to buffer, subtree, etc.) to the function, perhaps using C-u as a prefix for a buffer restriction and C-u C-u for a subtree restriction. So I figured this should work: 
 (defun my/org-agenda-restr (&optional arg) (interactive "P") (when arg (org-check-for-org-mode)) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list 'my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg '(4)) 'buffer) ((equal arg '(16)) 'subtree))) (view (cdr (assoc (completing-read "Select an agenda view: " my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view restr))) 
 But it doesn't. For some reason, no matter which custom view I try to call, I get a CRM prompt asking me to choose a keyword. 
 Now, I thought maybe I was passing the wrong type of object as the third argument for org-agenda, So I tested using this, and it looks like what I'm passing as the third argument is a symbol, which I thought is what it wanted: 
 (defun my/test (&optional arg) (interactive "P") (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg '(4)) 'buffer) ((equal arg '(16)) 'subtree)))) (when (symbolp restr) (message "Yes")))) 
 So I'm going wrong somewhere, but cannot figure out where.

Zettelkasten contains many atom thoughts and this method chains each thought together by their unique addresses. This web of thoughts makes it convenient to visit from one thought to another.

 I tried to bind C-= to er/expand-region from the expand-region package but nothing happens when I press C-=. 
 If I try C-h k C-= it's as if I hadn't pressed any key at all. The minibuffer prompts me to press some keys as if I hadn't pressed anything. 
 For example a bare text-mode buffer C-h k C-= C-p previous-line.
 Further, if i try binding C-S-= the same situation - it's ignored. Yet binding C-+ works so when I press C-S-= what is bound to C-+ executes.
 As far as I can tell my OS (linux) window manager (xfce4 xf4wm) doesn't bind C-= to anything special.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I am working on a Haskell project using cabal. It is a simple executable cabal project with a Main.hs file which imports a few other .hs files.
 Whenever I build it using cabal new-run, the imported source files seem to only get recompiled if something that depends on them changes in Main.hs. This is the case regardless of whether they have been edited since the last compilation.
 How can I change this behavior? Am I doing something wrong? Surely I should be able to edit the imported files and have the changes be reflected upon compiling the project?
 My workaround as of now is to systematically delete, before each compilation, all the files generated by cabal during the last one, which I am sure is not the intended way.
 Sorry if my question is dumb; as might be apparent I don't know much about the compilation process but I'd be happy to know more.

 Recently, I decided to learn a new language (for fun, for job hunt etc) and am thinking of Scala. Since I love Haskell, I wanted to start with Functional Programming in Scala. However, seems like the book doesn’t cover Scala 3. Should I worry about it and use some other resource? Or should I just go with Scala 2.x?
 Also, since I haven’t started learning, I'd appreciate if you let me know if I should learn it or something else (maybe "Go for elixir since you like strictly functional stuff")?
 Thanks!
 Edit: Thank you all for your valuable comments. I made up my mind to give Scala a try. Probably I will start with 2.x and move to 3 after getting some head around it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm making a compiler for a Computer Science class for a fairly simple language based on pascal (Pascal-0).
 In this language, we have a few reserved keywords, the thing is, they are case-insensitive (as are the variables). That means that for example, function, FUNCTION and funCTiOn all mean the same thing.
 As these are reserved keywords, I can easily "hard-code" them into the Lexer with something like this:
 function { \_ -> FUNCTION } 
 But this obviously is not case insensitive.
 I found a possible way to do it with maps, but I really would prefer to do it via regex if possible.
 Obviously, I can also do something like:
  (f|F)(u|U) ... (o|O)(n|N) 
 but that's obviously out of the question as it is not scalable.
 Is this at all possible, and is there a better way to do it other than maps, if regex isn't possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to have a completing-read type command that can perform commonly used file moving/copying operations. For example, I'm constantly syncing a couple of projects to a remote machine where they run. Currently I bind a key for each one to an rsync shell command call like so:
 (defun myprojectA-sync () (interactive) (shell-command (concat "rsync -a --progress --exclude-from='~/myprojectA/.syncignore' ~/myprojectA/ remotemachine1:~/myprojectA/ && echo 'Done.'")))) (map! :leader :desc "Sync my project A from local machine" "c b" #'myprojectA-sync) 
 It'd be helpful to have one single command to call a completion list that can run the pre-defined file operations for Project A, B, C, etc. I don't see why they couldn't act on multiple machines (remotemachine1, remotemachine2, etc.) or use different commands (mv, scp, rsync, etc.).
 Is there some feature/package that already exists to do something like this? 
 If not, does anyone have suggestions for a novice in elisp when it comes to writing the function? My thoughts so far were just a bunch of lists like
 (setq sync-names '("Sync project A" "Sync project B")) (setq sync-method '("rsync" "scp")) (setq sync-dest-dir '("remotemachine1:~/dir1" "remotemachine2:~/otherdir")) 
 to call shell-command wrapped in competing-read.

 I have really tried to keep this as short as possible and could use some help. My friend and I manage a small business together and want an interface to create and assign tasks that we can mutually access and modify.

 Essentially, you name SQL files according to the keys in your `sql-connection-alist`, and with a `dbcnx` extension. The mode adds one keybinding: `C-c C-l`, which connects using the credentials associated with the filename/alist key, leaving you with one buffer containing queries you want to run and another in which to run them and see the results.

I'm building Emacs from source on Mac OS, 12.4 w/ M1.
 
I'm configuring Emacs with native compilation.
 
  ./configure --with-native-compilation \ --with-ns \ --disable-silent-rules 
  
The build succeeds, src/emacs runs like a charm and I make install.
 
My nextstep/Emacs.app runs, but emits a ton of libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver errors to the Messages buffer.
 
 I suspect the Emacs.app package has some misconfigured paths that are unable to find my libgccjit library, which I've installed via homebrew. I've tried experimenting with exec-path-from-shell to ensure Emacs is aware of my shell paths, but to no avail.
 In the meantime, I've been able to use emacs and emacsclient from the CLI with no issues to speak of. The only problems arise when I interact with the Emacs.app application. Anyone have an idea as to what's going on here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using GADTs to model the domain of my programme, and quite enjoying the experience, but have found that it requires quite a lot of boilerplate.
 For example, I am building a series of "filter" functions which filter input datatypes:
  data MyType = TypeOne | TypeTwo data MyEntity (t :: MyType) where MyEntityOne :: String -> MyEntity 'TypeOne MyEntityTwo :: String -> String -> MyEntity 'TypeTwo 
 I can create input filters which I can nicely compose with a fish (>=>) operator:
  filterOnes :: forall a. MyEntity a -> Maybe (MyEntity 'TypeOne) filterOnes x@(MyEntityOne {}) = Just x filterOnes _ = Nothing 
 The thing is, I'm finding writing this sort of case a bit tedious, and it would be much nicer to have something like this:
  filterOnes = filterFor @'TypeOne -- or, even better myFilter :: forall a. MyEntity a -> Maybe (MyEntity 'TypeOne) myFilter = (filterFor @'TypeOne) >=> someOtherFilter 
 But I don't know how to create something like this, which reminds me of the generic-lens library. I feel like this might be a common pattern with GADTs, is there an obvious solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've got some exciting news to share.
 Earlier this year, I've released the first version of HVM, a massively parallel functional runtime that aims to be the ultimate target for pure functional languages like Haskell, Elm, Kind and many others, and finally unleash the inherent parallelism of the functional paradigm. HVM's first version was very limited; it could only parallelize algorithms that recursed in a perfect binary tree fashion, it lacked IO and had some synchronization bugs. Soon, we'll be releasing an updated version, which fixes these bugs, includes IO primitives, and a new workstealing-based scheduler, which is capable of generalizing to basically any functional program that isn't inherently sequential. For example, it can use all cores on the computation of Fib(n), achieving maximal performance!
 The most exciting news, though, is that a GPU runtime is on the works. I've just, right now, finished the very initial prototype, a self-contained, 1200-LOC file that evaluates a busy recursive function on the GPU. It is performing about 680 million rewrites/second on 4096 cores of my Laptop RTX 3080. That's 4x more than single-thread performance, on the very first attempt of the very first prototype. I believe we'll soon be reaching record benchmarks on GPUs. Several API improvements and stability features will also be included on the upcoming update.
 We're ahead of very exiting times for functional programming, and I hope this encourages language developers to target the HVM! Imagine a working STG->HVM compiler? We're also interested in hiring a CUDA professional to help us profile and improve the GPU back-end. If you know someone who'd be interested, please let me know via DM! And be welcome to visit our Discord community and ask anything on the #HVM channel.

 This was an especially noticeable deficiency when trying selectrum with projectile-find-file - I couldn't open my dotfiles and type "init" to find "init.el", as it seemed to want me to specify the entire path preceding it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using emacs to write tex documents for a long time, and recently switched to spacemacs, with evil mode. I use the reftex command reftex-reference to insert \ref commands. In spacemacs evil mode, when I use this, the reference is inserted *before* the cursor (point), so that it's off by one character. I would like to know if it's possible to configure this to insert after. I'm asking here because I think this is a general evil-mode issue rather than a specific spacemacs configuration issue. Details below.
 Here's what happens:
 Have a tex file with some text like the following, with the cursor at the rectangle marker, and with the buffer in evil's "normal state" (like vim's normal mode), not insert mode.
 \begin{theorem}\label{mylabel} theorem text \end{theorem} Now some words▮ 
 Note that this is what happens when there's a space *after* "words" in the text; in evil's normal state, the cursor is a block that occupies the position of a character.
 Then I use the reftex-reference command and select "mylabel". The inserted text I get is
 Now some words\ref{mylabel}▮ 
 with the inserted \ref *before* the trailing space. Then the space appears *after*. I believe the line that actually does the inserting is line 510 of reftex-ref.el.
 ​
 To be clear, this is not because the final character is a space. If I delete the space after "words", positioning my cursor on the final "s", then the inserted reference looks like
 Now some word\ref{mylabel}s 
 with the cursor positioned on the final "s".
 ​
 So, the problem seems to be that reftex-reference is doing the insertion on the *left* side of the "normal state" cursor, not the right. I would like it to insert on the right. Does anyone here know how this can be configured?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I guess this is a rhetorical question because I doubt anyone knows why but it turns out that dired buffers return nil for buffer-file-name instead of the path to the directory they are viewing.
 I believe this has cost me a ton of time but I did learn a lot along the way. lsp-docker highest level function is lsp-docker-start. It calls lsp-workspace-root which calls buffer-file-name which, if starting from a dired buffer, returns nil so lsp-workspace-root returns nil and the LSP server is not started.
 This is my first venture into LSP mode and I was doing something slightly different, a basic low level function was returning nil, so I assumed I was way off track in my set up, and I needed to dig deeper. And, indeed, I came up with a solution. I was documenting what I had found for myself so I wouldn't forget and started asking myself more questions.
 I went back and tested lsp-workspace-root in a file that had LSP mode enabled and it returned the proper path for the workspace. I then restarted everything, loaded lsp-mode but didn't start it, and went to the directory of the project. Sure enough, lsp-workspace-root returned nil (as it had before). I then looked at the code and started to try and follow it step by step. That's when I discovered that dired buffers have no buffer-file-name. I opened TAGS (an arbitrary file within the project) and now lsp-workspace-root returns the proper workspace.
 I think I could have set up my LSP stuff with a simple YAML file had I tried lsp-docker-start from a file rather than a dired buffer and saved the time spent coming up with the solution I pointed to.
 Anyhow... live and learn I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To add to the list of Haskell wishes I posted yesterday: instance derivation for variable size tuples.
 That each tuple size has to be treated separately is really annoying. A lot of effort has been spent on much less important (= less common) problems, it certainly can be solved somehow with the syntax for variable type tuple size + extended tuple size... Actually maybe I'm just reinventing some existing wheel, but I've never seen it used.
 For example:
 class Encoding a where encode :: a -> String 
 Now I have to do:
 instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) = encode a <> encode b instance Encoding (a, b, c) where encode (a, b, c) = encode a <> encode b <> encode c -- and so on until the limit of either tuple size or patience is reached 
 You can see code like this across endless number of libraries, including base
 Why cannot I instead have something like this:
 instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) = encode a <> encode b instance Encoding (..., b) where encode (a@..., b) = encode a <> encode b 
 Never mind the specific syntax, it can be whatever, but the idea is to define instance for all tuple sizes recursively.
 Is it maybe possible already?
 That would also require (and allow) some size-polymorphic operations to add/split the first/last tuple elements, in a type safe way.
 I've no idea why it doesn't already exist.

 I can't quite figure how to search across all the documentation for a specific word or regex if possible. 
 Example: I know that org-clock-report table (or clocktable) has :narrow param. I initially found it in google but now, since I know it exists, how can I quickly find info about this param directly in emacs? For example I want to find a manual page where this param is mentioned. Is there anything like apropos-EVERYTHING command that will look for a word (or regex) in all documentation? 
 Even more. I now know that info about :narrow param for clock table can be found in org manual on a page called The clock table. I know it from google. How could I find this page using emacs? 
 How would you find that page in emacs manual?
 P.S. I know about describe-* and apropos-* (and info) functions but I don't see any function that does the search across everything. There are also similar questions in the internet and there is a suggestion to search the documentation with grep or zgrep which I don't find useful. They just search in *.info files which when opened don't behave as info pages. Is greping the only way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen developers expensing a Sublime Text / JetBrains license to their employer, no questions asked. It would be amazing if one could similarly contribute financially towards emacs development efforts. 
 Would it be possible to cook up something formal enough (through FSF or some other org) like an annual "Emacs support license" with a couple of different tiers based on amounts (such that users can choose the split to different projects of interest). Users might then be able to expense it at work with the justification that it helps improve the specific packages they depend on (including core emacs). The same "licenses" could equally well serve as a portal for personal donations, but I feel that there's likely substantial low-hanging fruit in getting corporate funding in this grassroots manner.
 (I've pondered about this before, but some questions on the emacs survey reminded me of this again.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently switching my package management from Debian to Guix, and so far it's been wonderful. However, I just found something very curious. In the screenshot, you can see my 'old' self compiled Emacs (28.1) and my new Emacs (28.2) installed via Guix. They render the same text in the same file, in the same theme, with the same font (as per M-x describe-font), but they look quite different.
 Here's a screenshot showing the two side by side: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-a7bdddc0.png
 The version to the left is quite thin, the weight seems off. However, the weight is the same. Changing the weight will not remove this discrepancy. 
 Both Debian and Guix have the bold variant of Fira installed: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-36be0060.png
 Generally speaking, the bold variant works insofar that I can use it globally: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-5620acc4.png
 However, when used in a font-face, it won't become bold: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-bb7ddfd5.png
 I'm happy if anyone can point me to the necessary change to make the new install look the same as before. Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 Hi everyone, 
 ​
 I'm trying to write an elisp function that allows me to more easily query org-roam database with various keywords.
 ​
 Suppose I want to find all the titles that contain both "hello" and "world", I know this can be done with a single query instance like the following:
 ​
 (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from titles
 :where (and (like title "%hello%")
 (like title "%world%")) ] )
 ​
 Now I'm trying to turn this into an elisp function to make it easier to use. However, the challenge is my queries can contain an arbitrary number of keywords, for example:
 (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from titles
 :where (and (like title "%hello%")
 (like title "%world%") 
 (like title "%again%")) ] )
 ​
 The function should thus accept a list of keywords and return the notes that contains ALL the keywords in that list, something like:
 ​
 my-func('("hello" "world")) -> should return all notes containing "hello" "world"
 my-func('("hello" "world" "again")) -> should return all notes containing "hello" "world" "again"
 ​
 Can anyone suggest how to implement such a function?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone proficient in Haskell can give me some pointers on a homework assignment I'm currently bashing my head against. We're currently covering higher order functions, and our professor wants us to write a function that acts as a form of simple memory storage. Here's the part of the assignment that's stumping me:
 -- We'll consider a different way to represent memory. Memoryf is a function from variable names to values. type Memoryf = String -> Int -- The function memf1 gives all variables the value of zero memf1 = \_ -> 0 -- The following commands use the function putValue to modify our memory function: memf2 = putValuef "z" 3 memf1 memf3 = putValuef "y" (-2) memf2 memf4 = putValuef "x" 1 memf3 -- putValue should take three arguments: -- 1. The name of a variable, x -- 2. The variable value m -- 3. A Memoryf function -- putValue should assign x to m and return the updated Memoryf function putValue :: String -> Int -> Memoryf -> Memoryf putValue x m memf = _________________________ -- Write your code here -- Example output: -- (putValue "x" 5 memf4) "x" -- 5 
 My thinking is that calling putValue should add something to the effect of "if memf x is called, return m" but I have no idea how to write this. The furthest I've gotten is:
 putValue :: String -> Int -> Memoryf -> Memoryf putValue x m memf = (\x -> m) 
 which is useless because it will return the value of m for any variable, and thus doesn't work as a store of value.
 I'd greatly appreciate any guidance y'all have to offer. I'm giving myself a headache trying to sort through this myself.

 ​
 Is anyone able to compile on the latest MacOS?
 ​
 So far, I've been unable to link the libgccjit hello world: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html
 The farthest I can get is to the following errors:
 gcc-11: warning: could not understand version '13.00.00'
 ld: -rpath can only be used when targeting Mac OS X 10.5 or later
 collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
 At which point, it seems as if the problems are inherent to gcc-11 in combination with MacOS's ld. Anyone able to make this work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I was trying lsp-mode. After getting a bit annoyed with my laptop's fan always getting activated, I decided to try eglot. So far it feels much more lightweight.
 I'm having trouble getting it to do some things though.
 For context, I use pyvenv to manage my virtual environments:
 (use-package pyvenv:ensure t:config(pyvenv-mode 1)(pyvenv-activate "~/miniconda3/envs/myenv/"))
 I have done both conda install python-lsp-server[all] -c conda-forge and conda install pyright in this environment.
 If I use pyright-langserver, then a lot of imports are "unknown".
 If I use pylsp, then those imports seem to work, but I get some funny autocompletion behaviour. 
 import numpy as np
 np.lin
 This says "no completion found". But
 from numpy import linalg
 linalg.
 This works as expected, and I get reasonable suggestions for completions.
 ​
 Can someone tell me what's going on here and I to get this working? I was hoping things would work right out of the box, but...

 I recently switched to straight.el mostly for packages contributing purposes and it works really great. 
 In my init.el I sometimes use package-installed-p function to check if package is installed but straight.el doesn't install packages "emacs way" so that function always return nil. I expect there should be similar function in straight.el but I can't find one. 
 Do you know if it's exists? 
 Thanks
 EDIT: There is straight--installed-p but it expects a RECIPE and I don't really understand what is this. Definitely not a package name

 I'll then C-x 5 2 to create a new frame and start opening files there. Then I switch buffers, and what I see are all my buffers.
 Is there a way in which I could group/filter buffers based on some default criteria? For example, if the buffer belongs to a project (with a .projectile file), filter those buffers into one group. 
 Or better yet, simply add filters so that I can stay organized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use doom emacs and it offers [ ], [-] and [X] as part of the org-todo-keywords.
 In the org-agenda I noticed that the state changes for these states are not listed with the corresponding time when org-agenda-log-mode is active.
 Here is an example to display what it looks like instead:
 Tuesday 25 October 2022 inbox: 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ State: (DONE) DONE Test1 TODO -> DONE inbox: State: ([X]) [X] Test2 [ ] -> [X] 
 The headline with Test2 is displayed without the time. Both headlines have a LOGBOOK drawer that does look the same.
 * DONE Test1 TODO -> DONE :LOGBOOK: - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2022-10-25 Tue 10:00] :END * [X] Test2 [ ] -> [X] :LOGBOOK: - State "[X]" from "[ ]" [2022-10-25 Tue 10:00] :END 
 Further it seems like all todo keywords that start with [ and end with ] are not displayed with the corresponding time but below the time-grid with State: in front like seen above.
 I believe I tracked down the function that generates the State: entries (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/9bfe00dda6b59d9b93eb7a825f6e0868afa1cca3/lisp/org/org-agenda.el#L5943) but I am not really able to understand the function and what is causing this behavior as I am fairly new to emacs/elisp
 Is there someway to show the tasks with the checkbox style todo keywords with time?
 Is this a bug or a feature that I can configure?

 Obviously the solution right now is incomplete, but I keep getting the following type error for a:
  • Couldn't match expected type: [a0] with actual type: ([Int], Int) • In the first argument of ‘zip’, namely ‘a’ In a stmt of a 'do' block: b <- zip a ([1 .. 9] :: [Int]) In the expression: do a <- zip arr ([1 .. 9] :: [Int]) b <- zip a ([1 .. 9] :: [Int]) return _ 
 On inspection in the editor a is given a type annotation of [Any] , rather than ([Int], Int) as I expected

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my internship at Tweag, I got the opportunity to work on Chainsail (see the announcement blog post), a web service that helps to sample from multimodal probability distributions.
A common approach to sampling well-behaved distributions involves Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods derived from the
basic Metropolis-Hastings algorithm; building a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its stationary distribution.
The major benefit of Metropolis-Hastings over more “direct” sampling methods is that it doesn’t require the target distribution to be normalized.
But it does have a big flaw:
if the distribution presents multiple modes separated by areas of low probability, the Markov chain tends to get stuck in one mode, and thus samples the distribution incorrectly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its initial release (corresponding thread) the library has got several improvements (the current version is 2.2.0.0), but the most significant development happened within the ecosystem. Here's the list of new adapter libraries:
  
crypto-rng-effectful - generation of cryptographically secure random bytes and numbers.
 
log-effectful - structured logging with multiple backends.
 
hpqtypes-effectful - access to a PostgreSQL database.
 
retry-effectful - combinators for monadic actions that may fail.
 
 It's worth noting that all of these are light wrappers over existing libraries, not rewrites. As advertised, effectful makes it easy to adapt libraries to be used as effects.
 Also, the Monocle project has moved to effectful.
 If anyone was skeptical about effectful, maybe that'll convince you to give it another look. I'm sure this is just the beginning :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to this: https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/10/20/language-rankings-6-22/
 ​
 What is surprising is that it is:
 - more adopted than Clojure that I thought to be the most popular functional language (even though I think it's really bad).
 - much more adopted than Erlang and F#, I thought Haskell is used less frequently than these.
 - has almost as many projects as Elixir in GitHub, but much more popular on Stack Overflow - shows the strength of the community.
 - as widely adopted as Perl.
 ​
 Looking at this chart I think we can get Haskell into the top 10 (or even 5) languages by solving several problems, as community (I do have a vested interest that it happens – our SimpleX Chat is written in Haskell):
 - make JSON a first class citizen in Haskell code, ideally with some syntax-level support, without requiring QQ, rather than one of the most complex to use libraries. It doesn't seem a coincidence that 2 most popular languages - JavaScript and Python - make it really easy to integrate with JSON.
 - make cross-platform compilation "manageable" (including mobile and web), not just "possible".
 - solve problem of compiled binary size - it should be at least 5x, better 10x smaller – even if it comes at cost of 10x longer compilation time (so that we would only use it for production builds).
 - at the same time, make interpreted tests execution simpler - I still can't figure out how to do it, waiting for several minutes until it builds with most cores idling is very time consuming... Maybe this is a solved problem, and there is a simple answer how to do it.
 - make networking and cryptography more trustworthy - with exodus of some maintainers into Rust-land they are at risk of abandonment – I will share more comments on this subject a bit later.
 ​
 These are all issues that Haskell Foundation and community can help solving, we could chip in some time/money too if there is some concerted effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for suggestions for how to manage repeated tasks with subtasks. Ideally, I'd like to be able to mark the parent heading as done and have all the DONE subtasks (or even better, those without a certain property) be changed to TODO. In practice, what I want is to be able to move from this: 
 * TODO Meal plan for the week SCHEDULED: <2022-10-24 +1w> ** DONE Make list of dishes ** DONE Make grocery list ** DONE Get groceries 
 to this: 
 * TODO Meal plan for the week SCHEDULED: <2022-10-31 +1w> ** TODO Make list of dishes ** TODO Make grocery list ** TODO Get groceries 
 after marking the heading task as done. 
 I suspect I could make use of org-todo-repeat-hook and define a function that will take all the sub-tasks of a given task and change them from e.g. DONE to TODO, or to the TODO state the parent will be in after repeat, e.g. 
 (defun my/org--bequeath-state () (let ((state (org-get-todo-state))) (org-map-entries (lambda () (org-todo state)) nil 'tree))) (add-to-list 'org-todo-repeat-hook 'my/org--bequeath-state) 
 But I'm wondering if anyone has given this more thought and has a better conceived solution they'd be willing to share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I've recently been trying to set up emacs to play nicely with python. The number of options is a bit overwhelming, but a lot of signs are pointing towards using lsp with pyright and lsp-ui. So that's what I've been doing, along with using pyvenv to choose my virtual environments. But I've noticed that I don't get any warnings if my lines are too long. I'm not sure why this is? Does it have to do with my settings, or is this not something lsp/pyright should catch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A year or two ago, straight.el was probably the most recommended package manager for GNU Emacs. As I’ve revisited my configuration today, I noticed that there are a few recent package managers (namely, leaf and elpaca) which are new to - at least - me and (at least elpaca) want to be straight.el’s “successor”.
 Is there any write-up about the state of GNU Emacs package management in 2022? Straight.el works for me (and I need its custom build features for two packages), but I don’t want to rely on deprecated packages for too long.

Well, Flycheck have been showing errors with objects member in classes, but this is a False positive, even company sugest to me the correct completion but Flycheck mark this like error.
 I have searched in web, and found that Flycheck is using wrong dir, but i don't know how customize that. Is there some option to Flycheck work well on Django?
 pylint has an module named pylint-django. Can be this enhabled in Flycheck?
 Edit: I found solution that works to me for now, but isn't automatic.
 1) Install pylint-django pluging with pip pip install pylint-django
 2) Create a pylint config file in the root directory of project. You can do thi from terminal
 pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc
 3)Enhable Django pluging in pylint config file in "load-plugins" line
 load-plugins=pylint_django
 That worked to me. When you start flychek in current buffer, you can see if flycheck is using the config file:

 2) Spark advices any general advice? any advice on how to best use dataframes with Spark in this project? are there general things to be careful of in order not to have bad performances?
 how would it be better to return the results of a query considering that I will have to create a graphical interface?
 3) query tips I use a flight dataset. What might be some interesting aggregate queries to do? I have a lot of columns, so a lot of information about each flight
 I know that is a lot of questions, but answers for just one question will also be helpful.

 📋 https://emacssurvey.org/
 About the Survey
 This time there are no non-free Javascript or user-tracking caveats as this features a bespoke survey framework written from scratch for the Emacs User Survey to support a pure HTML-forms + CSS approach with server-side rendering 🎉.
 See the FAQ for more information on the survey itself.
 Promoting the survey
 It would be fantastic for this to be shared as far and wide as possible, to get responses from a large swathe of the community. If you can share this with the non-Reddit Emacs communities you are a part of, as well as any friends or colleagues that use Emacs that would be greatly appreciated 😊.
 So far the Survey has been shared on: - Reddit - Hacker News - Lobste.rs
 Addendum: all my responses are shown as missing?
 It has been noticed by several people that their results page shows some or all of their answers to be missing for questions they answered. In every case I've checked so far, all responses did get recorded in the database, but there seems to be a glitch that is occurring in some cases with the display/export of results.
 TLDR; Do not worry, your answers are safe.

 I am currently using Org mode to try and write a JET SOP/ write fantasy books or whatever. However, When trying to navigate through the text instead of going through each line, it jumps through each paragraph in chunks. 
 I know that this is due to "word wrap" and that technically it is all one giant line. But how does one change this behavior. I know a few days ago when I tested Visual Studio code I got the same issue. 
 (ignore my bad writing, this is super duper early) 
 TL:DR: how to change function of emacs to make it act more like a traditional word processor?

 Then I started using `next-buffer` and `previous-buffer` and developing an intuition for what buffer would show up.
 It's made my experience of using emacs drastically better in the same way that learning `ctrl+tab` and `ctrl+shift+tab` in web browsers made my browsing experience better. Maybe these kinds of feelings are very subjective, but I feel like this one might generalize to others experiences well.
 By default they are bound to `C-x <left>` and `C-x <right>`.
 Feel free to also share any similar other "wow this makes buffer management so much nicer feeling to use" experiences you've had.

 The :file link created by org-attach when org-attach-store-link-p is non-nil should be to the attachment, not to the original. In fact the link is to the original, not to the attachment. I believe this is a bug.
 DETAILS
 I've noticed some unexpected behavior in terms of the link that org-attach creates and places in org-stored-links when org-attach-store-link-p is non-nil. I'm seeing it when the method of attachment is move, copy, or symlink, either via org-attach-method, or when chosen directly when running C-c C-a. (I haven't tested any of the others.) The issue concerns the target of the created link.
 My expectation is that the target of such a link should point to the actual attachment itself. By that I mean, the target should be the path to the file or link in its place in th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm very new to org-mode although it already looks like something that I've been trying to invent myself (in much more lame ways) for many years.
 One thing that I don't immediately see from them the manual - is there some "standard" or well-know way to work with the outline-organized data that have multiple dimensions?
 Here is what I mean by that:
 Say, I have a lab diary where I track number of processes - each process every day:
 * Day 1 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team my notes on it ** Ongoing Experiment 1 checking out the night results, trying new approaches ** Something else ... * Day 2 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team ... ** Ongoing Experiment 1 ... ** Something else ... * Day 3 ... 
 And this is how it goes!
 So, the first dimension here is the timeline: Day 1, Day 2, ... while the second one is the processes that repeat every day.
 Clearly, depending on task, it would be handy to see this outline from the different points of view: sometimes considering the "time" dimension to be the outer one, sometimes to see the "process" dimension to be the outer:
 Time dimension is outer:
 * Day 1 ** Process 1 ** Process 2 ... * Day 2 ... 
 Process dimension is outer:
 * Process 1 ** Day 1 ** Day 2 ... * Process 2 ... 
 One can easily come up with a case of three or for dimensions like. E.g. "Date/[Home|Work]/Habit/Successes".
 Turning the tree inside out to follow the day by day progress for one of experiments would be very helpful. As well as tracking the daily successes in the second example.
 Is there a built-in feature or packages or a known workflow for such case?
 Like best practice(s) for such data organization, turning the outline inside out, making different OLAP-like views into the outline?
 thanks :)

While this is nice, for something more elaborate tabulated-list-mode is not enough. I am trying to get a view inspired by magit's status buffer, so I thought I could use magit-section for this. However, I couldn't find any guides on how to make something with it, and I am not savy enough to extract the exact usage from the magit code (I did try).
 So my question is, does anyone have any guides or any simple elisp code that I can use for reference to create a new derived mode out of magit-section?
 Edit: Fixed formatting.

 Is there a setting I need to turn on? Or is it simply the case that amm doesn't support indentation based syntax?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, let me say, I accept that this isn't strictly speaking an Emacs question, but a quick search on Reddit suggests that there isn't a better place to ask. And I am using it with Emacs so I'm hoping you'll take a generous view.
 I download mail with mbsync, manage it with mu4e, and send it with SMTP. This all works fine and has for years.
 Except that I find that I suddenly have to deal with email hosted on office365. It does IMAP, so I can read my mail, but it warns
 `Notice: far side store does not support flag(s) 'P'; not propagating.`
 The consequence of this is that the changes I make locally aren't reflected on the server. Refiling or deleting mail doesn't have any effect. That means my INBOX is just going to grow and grow and grow and eventually that's going to be a problem. (Nevermind that if I decide to peek at my mail from my phone or something, it's going to be a confusing mess.)
 In a previous life, I managed with davmail, but dear $DEITY in heaven, I'd really rather not have to do that again.
 Anyone know if mbsync (or the office365 account) can be configured to make things Work Right(TM)?

 My current setup involves Kontact for IMAP and EWS.
 All the setups I've seen so far do download/sync all Emails from the IMAP server. Is it possible only download the headers and then the full emails on demand? My current setup is that I keep my Emails on the IMAP server and fetch only what I want to read.
 Akonadi does this quite good.

 data Object = Object { pos :: Pos, dir :: Dir} deriving (Eq, Ord)
 -- An Walker is an object with a position and a direction. newtype Walker = Walker Object newtype Exit = Exit Object newtype Entry = Entry Object ```
 In order to move them, I have a function that takes a list of walkers all located on the same tile. Several walkers can be on the same tile, in which case they collide.
  -- this function takes a list of walkers with the same position. move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws = ... 
 I'm not so satisfied with this solution, because the pre-condition (all located at the same position) is not reflected. I'm thinking of several solutions to express/enforce the condition: 1. Use a guard 2. Decompose the first argument 3. Use refined types
 Use a guard
 I could use a guard to enforce my pre-condition:  move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws | isSamePos ws = ... move _ = error "All walkers must have the same position" 
 It's an OK solution, however it's a pity that the types don't help us and look clumsy.
 Decompose the first argument
 I could decompose the first argument to express the fact that they all have the same position:  move :: Pos -> [Dir] -> [Walker] move pos dirs = ... 
 It's an interesting solution because now illegal states are unrepresentable. However, I lost the idea that my inputs are walkers and not anything else.
 Use refined types
 I couldn't install Liquid Haskell, but I guess the solution would look like:  {-@ move :: SamePosList Walker -> [Walker] @-} move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws = ... 
 It seems overkill :)
 What is your opinion? Thanks!

 Several walkers can be located on the same tile, in which case they collide. To manage this, I have a function that will move them. This function takes a list of walkers all located at the same position, and calculate their next position:  -- this function takes a list of walkers that are at the same position. move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws = ... 
 I'm not very satisfied with this function, because the pre-condition (walkers must be at the same position) is not encoded in the type. I'm thinking of several solutions: 1. Encode the precondition as a guard 2. Decompose the argument 3. Enforce property with refined types
 Encode the precondition as a guard
  move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws | isSamePos ws = ... move _ = error "All walkers must be at the same position".  It's an OK solution, however it's a pity that the type doesn't help you.
 Decompose the argument
 I could decompose the list of walkers, removing the redundant part (they all have the same position):  move :: Pos -> [Dir] -> [Walker] move pos dirs = ...  That solution is interesting, because illegal states are now unrepresentable. However, I lost the idea that the input is a walker.
 Enforce property with refined types
 I could use Liquid Haskell to check the precondition using a SAT solver. I'm not quite sure how to write it, it seems a bit overkill.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi all,
 a package that i am using defines an a-list of various font properties f.e. 'family', 'weight', 'height' etc. etc.
 i want to set values to these properties progammatically, f.e. on linux + my-home-machine i would want to set 'family' to say "Iosevka Mono", on my laptop i would use a high-dpi friendly font etc.
 i wrote a trivial function like so:
  (defun util:get-host-default-font-family () "return host specific font-family" (interactive) (cond ((utils:host-name-is "host-01") Iosevka Mono") ((utils:host-name-is "host-02") "Go Mono Regular") ((t "Consolas")))) 
 the "utils:host-name-is <name-of-host>" returns 'true' when current hostname matches the provided argument, 'false' otherwise. the above function does the right thing when called interactively on different hosts. 
 however, when i use it like so
  (:default-family (util:get-host-default-font-family)) 
 i get a
  Wrong type argument: stringp, (util:get-host-default-font-family) 
 how do i fix it ?
 
 thanks !

However, there are a couple of issues that I am wondering if Emacs supports: the first is that the message prompt is terminal style, which means that it keeps moving as I receive messages. Is there a way to replicate the interface of other IRC clients where there is a separate frame for inputing messages?
 The second issue is that it seems that receiving files from an XDCC server does not work. Is there some special configuration for it to work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my config https://github.com/vidbina/dotfiles/tree/reorg-for-lit-prog/emacs#-text you may spot that I use visual-fill-column-mode and adaptive-wrap-mode to improve the readability of text in Emacs.
 ⚠️ The gotcha is that I sometimes have bits of context that I want to exclude from being "wrapped" such as tables. My current UX on this is poor as I usually want to see the table fully extended while simultaneously sneaking a peak at text in the paragraphs around it. Is there a way to do this (exclude a region from being wrapped) or is there a term that describes what I'm looking for that I should factor into my web-search queries?
 🤔 There is never really a use case where the wrapped table is even readable for me so it's just a lost piece of screen real estate when I wrap the buffer. It may as well be folded away to be conjured up through something similar to C-c C-v v where can open expanded code into a preview buffer (to see how all the noweb refs resolve). How do you deal with wrapping when tables are present? Hoping to learn what I can improve about my usage to minimize this "pain".
 💡 For now I keep toggling between the wrapped and non-wrapped states and now that I'm typing this, I'm thinking that I can open a cloned frame or buffer. That way I can show the table non-wrapped or extended in one buffer, while I look at the wrapped peripheral text in a cloned buffer and thus have a way to keep the wrapped states apart. This however does alter the layout of buffers which is again a bit of a UX killer as it disturbs the y-flow of the text in the original buffer if you catch my drift.
 Looking fwd to getting schooled. Thanks for helping think along. 🙏🏿

 Relatively new to emacs. I'm looking to use emacs speaks statistics and take advantage of using polymode and quarto mode (https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-emacs) which best I can tell is a version of polymode that allows using quarto based documents.
 So far I can build the quarto document and output a html window, but if I try to run individual chunks or pieces of code it doesn't work. The github page states it uses ESS by default but when I try to use the ESS run commands I get Wrong type argument: window-live-p, nil. I've googled this error message but haven't seen anything similar so far.
 I've also tried having polymode itself enabled with quarto mode and on its own, and using the polymode run chunks command but I get a similar error message.
 Anyone have any ideas or potential solutions?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently released Tecton, a new DSL for authoring CSS. My goal for this project is to make "CSS in PureScript" more practical for real-world use cases, meaning: * Extensive type-level validation * Minimal syntactic overhead * Broad CSS coverage * Alignment with W3C specifications * Exhaustive testing
 If you're interested to take a look, a good place to start might be the Zen Garments example, adapted from Dan Mall's CSS Zen Garden submission in order to assess the library's CSS coverage.
 From there, you might like to see some examples of CSS errors that will fail to compile. Some of these issues are significantly more complicated than e.g. providing a <length-percentage> value where a <length> was expected (although those cases are covered too).
 Hopefully the next step would be to try it out for yourself, using the large test suite as a reference wherever the (WIP) docs currently fall short.
 I am looking forward to any feedback you might have to offer! I would also like to note that contributions are welcome, so please let me know if you are interested via Twitter or [email](mailto:nick@saunde.rs); or, if you have something specific in mind already, just review the contributing guidelines and then open an issue.
 Thanks for reading!

 I can only guess that the Doom sessions orChemacs2 sessions read some compiled scripts in that directory which are not compatible with them. From the Doom docs, there is an EMACSDIR environment variable that is supposed to be the ~/.emacs.d directory for that Doom session.
 After reading the docs I have decided to run doom install with --doomdir, --emacsdir, and I am also configuring the Chemacs2 ~/.emacs-profiles.el to set the relevant environment variables as described in https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/xs0avw/a_way_to_manage_multiple_doom_profiles_with/, which now includes more variables.
 Moving forward I am also adding the EMACSDIR option.
 Should these options reduce the risk of a shared ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/28-xxxxx?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, I would like to learn fs2 thoroughly (how it works, and build some different size of applications with it).
 Before I jump right into learning fs2, I would like to understand its bigger picture. However, I haven't been able to find any useful information about what are the possible use cases of fs2, for what we can use this awesome library, and so on.
 To my understanding, fs2 is used when we don't know the size of the incoming data.
 I am looking for answers to these questions:
  
How does a REST-based microservice look like when it heavily relies on fs2?
 Can you suggest good learning resources for fs2? (for example: github projects...)
 What are the possible use-cases for fs2?
 Can we increase throughput by using fs2 instead of using only cats-effect? (for example in a REST-based microservice?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I’m experimenting with some pretty non-standard layouts’ configurations (using a lot of xkb features like custom types and actions) to work around some wrists problems, multiple languages/layouts I need to work with also attempting to get to a setup that doesnt break the flow (e.g. standard layouts for english and ukrainian have weirdly different placements of non-alphanumerics which doesnt help at all to internilize the physical typing habbits, etc.)
 So far its starting to look pretty well but I have the major problem with getting my multiple layouts work in Emacs.
 Given that at different times a same key on my keyboard could generate a different symbol from six different alphabets, I’m trying to understand how to get emacs bindings to work invariantly to this (well ordered) chaos.
 An idea that came to my mind was this: if emacs did have a central function that performs a key lookup - it could’ve been probably advised - in case of a failed search - to change all the latin letters in the failed to be found sequence to the ones from the other alphabet I use and rerun the search. And do it for every of the languages of interest until it either works out or finally fails.
 I wasn’t able though to confirm from the elisp reference that this is possible)
 Sorry for the probable naivety of this question - I’m really not that familiar yet with Emacs internals and not speaking from arrogance here - just trying to describe my thought process trying to both explain what I need and not to overload the reader with complexities of my setup.
 Probably there is some true and very different way to solve tgis question that I’m not aware of.
 Thank you :)

You know, these combinations of patterns on the bass drums, the snare and the Charley. I have already written a few charts in lilypond / Frescobaldi.
 And I am figuring out that it would be cool to develop an app for emacs that uses lilypond and the various combinations bd/snare/charley patterns to shows exercices to be worked out.
 The question is: is it affordable for someone like me, to start on such a project? I'd like to learn, but I need something motivating... And this would be it.
 Is Lisp a good idea for such a project? Or would Python be a better choice?
 If you have a few crumbs to lead me in the right direction, so that at least I start on the right path.. that'd be cool

French is a fine park, Italien a big, bright, colorful wood. But German is almost a primeval forest, so dense and mysterious, so without a passage and yet with thousand paths. You can't get lost in a park, and not so easily and dangerously in the bright Italian wood; but in the German jungle, within four, five minutes, you can go missing.

 I use doom emacs to edit math notes, full of latex fragments, in org mode.
 I really need to have a quick way to toggle the renderization of all fragments in a document, as if I was going to each one of them with the cursor and doing M-x org-latex-preview, which of course I have keymapped to an easier binding (SPC l p).
 I saw on the web that a way to do this would be prepending C-u to org-latex-preview (in my case C-u SPC l p). But C-u is bound to evil-scroll-up, thus preventing me to do any other combination starting with that C-u. 
 So I've been trying to disable the binding of C-u from evil-scroll-up. 
 Note: in the afterthought, that is not really what I should have been doing, because instead it would be way better to use something like SPC l l p. 
 Anyway, I tried p…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 This is probably quite a simple question and more to do with Emacs Lisp syntax than anything else. I'm trying to set Org's org-tag-alist variable so that a directory containing all my projects can easily have the type of project categorised according to some default tags. Unfortunately, the .dir-locals.el file uses different syntax (dot notation?) to what I'm already barely used to with regular Emacs Lisp, so I'm struggling to make it work. In particular, I'm trying to get some group tags in that variable, but I'm utterly clueless because I just haven't had the time to learn Emacs Lisp yet.
 Could anyone supply a minimum working example of a .dir-locals.el snippet that adds group tags to Org mode? Many, many thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 I've just started using Org and I am fascinated by it and the possibilities it offers over every other system I've ever tried. I've started tinkering with custom agenda views, and I've got this fairly basic custom view happening with the following code:
  (setq org-agenda-files '("~/Documents/projects")) (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("p" "Programming todos" ((tags "programming"))))) 
 Now, I have a number of projects in that projects directory whose top-level headline is marked with the WAIT TODO keyword, but whose children are marked with regular TODO. My logic here is that I want to mark an entire project as waiting or blocked without having to mark every subtree or subtask as waiting, too.
 The problem is, when I use my custom agenda view, the project headline appears (albeit greyed-out), and all its children appear. Is there a way to exclude an entire tree from appearing in a custom agenda view if its headline or one of its parents is marked with a certain keyword, in this case, WAIT?
 Thanks in advance for any help!

 Over the years I have discovered that the sub is divided fairly evenly over eglot and lsp-mode. I was wondering, what makes users prefer one over the other? 
 I am evaluating moving over from lsp-mode, now that eglot is shipped with emacs and it supports emacs-native features where possible. I mainly use python, julia, and web-devvy things like typescript, tsx, css, and html.
 Thanks!

There is however one thing I am missing: keybindings to insert some special snippets/characters I use really frequently. Specifically, I want to bind Control-Shift-m to insert the R pipe operator „%>%“, and Alt-i to insert the assignment arrow „<-“, like in RStudio, as not having these bindings sort of disrupts my workflow. What would be the best way to do this in Lisp?

Middle of the day today, emacs started acting weird for me: The status line (the one with the mode and file/buffer name) started being underlined instead of reverse, and when I scroll down whatever buffer I'm editing, ALL of the text gets underlined. This makes it very hard and annoying to edit.
 I'm on a mac, and this only happens when I run emacs under screen. But I depend on screen, and do everything in a screen session, ingrained habit of decades that would be very hard to change.
 I've been using emacs in plain text shell sessions running under screen on macs for many many years, and I've never seen this before. It started in the middle of the day, in a screen instance I've had running on this mac since…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been using org-mode and org-roam for a bit. I'm finding that my notes are kind of getting into a mess but that's mostly because of my insane life contexts I guess.
 Here is kind of where I'm at in life, for context:
  
Work (routine stuff, development projects underway, ideas, I have a bit of a management role but it's really spread out over a bunch of contexts in and of itself (different functional areas I manage)
 Business 1
 Business 2
 Personal Life
 Personal development projects
 Education goals
 Investment goals/research
  
I like keeping notes and todos together, but I think separate contexts is a good idea so if I'm in work mode I'm not seeing all the stuff I need to do in my business. Something I'm kind of wanting to is a way to mark something as delegated to X person. I don't need them to see that I delegated it, just to remind myself that I told them to do something and to follow up.
 ​
 I started out with a regular org file for each context, then ended up creating new org files for each "thing", which created my mess. Today I decided to try creating dailies in org-roam to see how that works out.
 ​
 Any suggestions for how to keep life organized in org or org-roam when you've got so much going on. From experience, no todo list/notes manager has ever really worked that well for this for me.... a few were okay (todoist on the todo list side and evernote on the notes side.... but they both had their own issues)
 ​
 I like org and org-roam I'm just struggling with how best to setup a structure that fits such a lifestyle.
 Any thoughts or input is very welcome...

However, I noted recently that my TRAMP sessions were suffering tremendous and unignorable lag when navigating within a file. I went through my enabled modes one-by-one and was surprised to learn that vc-mode was, in this case, the culprit. Setting vc-handled-backends like so:
 (setq vc-handled-backends '(Git)) 
 had a profound effect on latency. I'm not sure why this is the case, but its original value holds a bunch of entries for VCSs that died decades ago (CVS, SCCS, RCS…): it's possible that one of my packages was using all of vc-mode's backends.
 My TRAMP sessions to Codespaces are now as responsive and fast as if I were to connect to them via VS Code. Hope this helps someone!

I realized that I was feeling a bit stressed about the day but that the thought of my todo and agenda buffers had a calming effect. I thought to myself, "it's alright, you're organized and at least if there is chaos it is somewhat documented chaos and you don't have to hold it all in your mind."
 Last weekend, I took the time to do a much needed cleanup of my init.el file. I got rid of all the cruft of comments, things I'd tried but given up though not yet deleted. I made a move to using straight.el as my package manager. I switched from Ivy to Helm. I just did some things I'd been meaning to do for a while. I cleaned up my todo file and recommitted to using 'C-c a a' more throughout the day.
 I assume that many of you, like me, find a certain "gee, that's neat" quality to getting some of this working. A sense of satisfaction maybe. I like learning new ways to do things, maybe cleaner, tighter. But the thing that I keep coming back to even more than all that is that this technology, this nerdy system, has a way of calming me and making me feel better. It feels like the world has more and more information each day, more chaos, etc. Using org-mode helps me live in the world.
 I was curious to see if any of you have had similar thoughts about it?

 I'm putting together a little package to preview markdown files similarly to how they are rendered on GitHub. Previously I've used grip (and grip-mode), which are awesome, but I wanted a little more room for customization and to avoid hitting the GitHub API on every change.
 This package does the rendering locally if your Emacs has xwidget support. I'd really appreciate any feedback anyone has!

 Problem is the example projects there all use stack to import pure cabal projects, the latter of which do have mixins, but are not stack-ified themselves. In my case, I want to be able to add something to package.yaml or stack.yaml like:
 -- package.yaml (or stack.yaml) cabal-fields: mixins: base hiding (Prelude) - relude (Relude as Prelude) - relude 
 or something like that, just so that the .cabal file stack generates has this option enabled. I haven't been able to figure out how to do this. Some help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently studying Secrets of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler Inliner by Jones & Marlow (2002), and am trying to understand the "subtlety" they mention about the rapier algorithm.
 On the bottom left corner of page 7, they mention:
  
There is one other important subtlety in this algorithm: in the case where x is not in theta we must delete x from the substitution, denoted phi \ x. How could x be in the domain of the substitution, but not be in scope?
  
However, the authors do not elaborate much further due to space constraints.
 I'm trying to understand what they meant by this comment. Although I can fabricate inputs that produce the scenario they describe, I'm not sure what concrete example would lead to that input, nor why it's important to handle it the way they do.
 Also, the paper only shows two cases of their substitution algorithm that handles lambdas. Do we fall through to the second case if we fail the guard of the first case (i.e., when we match on a lambda introduces a variable already in-scope)? That is, am I correct in reading that as pseudo-Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am really new to Haskell and I came across this discussion about how closures in Haskell can be used to mimic objects in traditional OOP. 
 Needless to say, I did not understand much of the discussion. What is really confusing to me is that, if A is an instance of an object (in the traditional sense) then I can change and update some property A.property of A. This doesn't create a new instance of A, it updates the value. Exactly, how is this particular updating achieved via closures in Haskell? 
 I understand that mutability can have bad side effects and all. But if a property of an instance of an object, call it A.property for example, were to be updated many times throughout a program how can we possibly keep track of that in Haskell?
 I would really appreciate ELI5 answer if possible. Thank you for your time!!!

 I use magit quite heavily in emacs, and I'm regularly working on multiple git repositories at the same time. These are different repositories/worktrees for the same project, just with different branches checked out. I'm not sure if it is relevant, but these are Perl projects, using cperl-mode, and each project has a single TAGS files at the project root. The first time I use `M-.` (`xref-find-definitions`), I get prompted to load a TAGS file, and I select the one for the current repository I'm using. This works as expected. However when I happen to be editing a file from a different repository and hit M-., the previously loaded TAGS file is still used, so this brings me to the source file from the wrong repository. Since the files look identical, I don't notice this and regularly make edits in the wrong git worktree.
 I saw that I can load multiple tags tables using visit-tags-table, and then switch between them using select-tags-table. Is there any way to automate this so that when I use `M-.` it automatically chooses the TAGS file closest to the current file path? I looked into project.el and projectile, but I couldn't find any examples for how to do this.

However, there are limitations, for example, org-modern add space paddings to improve the visuals, which you cannot do with these two variables.
 Exactly for that reason, I will have little use for this discovery, and would rather keep it out of my .emacs.d. But hey, maybe someone would make use of this somehow :).
 You should be able to see an example also below. 
 (with-eval-after-load 'org-faces (setq org-todo-keyword-faces (append (cl-loop for todo in '("TODO" "NEXT" "STARTED" "PROJECT" "HOLD") with faces = '(:height 0.8 :inherit (org-modern-todo)) collect (cons todo faces)) (cl-loop for todo in '("CANCELLED" "DONE") with faces = '(:height 0.8 :inherit (org-modern-done)) collect (cons todo faces))) org-priority-faces (cl-loop with end = org-priority-lowest for i from org-priority-highest to end collect (list i :inherit 'org-modern-priority))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I drank the Kool-aid and I love it. I can't quite articulate what it is that I love about this language but since I learned how to use it... I use it for everything. I occasionally would like a CLI tool that doesn't exist on apt, and so I build it myself. I used to use C for this, and now it's Haskell! The other day I was thinking of spinning up a chess clone because I wanted to build an AI that could beat me at chess (without looking up how chess engines work, just as a puzzle) and I thought, why not Haskell?
 Something about programming in Haskell makes me feel like a god genius programmer. She's so fast, so sleek, such a pure functional mathematical language. It's easily my favorite language by far and I just can't quite figure out what it is that makes me geek the fuck out about it. 
 Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

For some reason it only evaluated to about 5 packages, while it listed over 20 in custom-set-variables. This continued whatever I did (-Q didn't help). So I tried moving my init.el. Without an init.el, package-selected-packages evaluates correctly. However, when I try to put it back, Emacs doesn't recognize it. What's going on?
 Edit: apparently, at some point, Emacs auto-generated a .emacs file. I've deleted it and init.el is recognised now, but the issue with package-selected-packages still remains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, really dumb question but I think I understand this wrong. Ok so... say i had this function 
 f :: a -> Bool
 f x = x==0 
 However, since im using the "==" operator, to tell haskell that i wont be using any other type other than the ones to which (==) has instances, Id make it this correct? 
 f :: (Eq a) => a -> Bool
 f x = x==0 
 But this throws an error telling me i also have to include (Num a) =>
 Why is that? I'm not using any operator that is in the Num a class... Why does it need this? Isn't the whole point of overloading to restrict "a" to only be a type which has an instance in the used operator/function?? What makes me add (Num a) => here too?

 I watched a couple videos on System Crafter's YouTube channel and I like how he can put configuration and initialization code specific for a package within the use-package construct. It seems very tidy and organized.
 I'm going to start playing with it but thought I'd see if anyone else has gotten it to work. It might be that I will need to set :ensure nil in each so use-package doesn't try to load the package since el-get will have already done it.

 What's the best style set of keybindings (in your opinion) for Emacs, and "Why?".
 Background:
  
I ask this since I have a keybinding to easily switch to Vim style keybindings a la 'Evil Mode', but only do so for programming purposes. 
 Everywhere else I use Emacs style keybindings (Org Mode, etc).
 I also use a few custom Hydras as well for weird things like buffer rotation, etc.
  
Curious what you crazy Emacs wizards use these days (ex: Xah Fly Keys, etc). Feel free to provide the "What" you use individual keybinding sets for as well.
 Let's have at it, let the best keybindings win! :)

 I've tried orgzly, but it does not really fit me.

 Is everyone just locked on 8.6 or earlier like we are?
 It seems like https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs/issues/821 is a rigid dealbreaker for any sizable project.
 Our setup of using a hybrid of ghcjs-8.6, ghc-8.6 and ghc-8.10 works well enough, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't being heavily stress tested.
 I'm hoping that ghc-9.6 can potentially come to the rescue with a JS backend, but I was curious if there are other solutions on the horizon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just thought I'd document this fix here.
 I have Emacs running portably on Dropbox through a batch script that sets the HOME environment variable:
 REM Set the environment variable HOME, which Emacs uses as the base directory. set HOME=%~dp0 REM Run Emacs, passing any parameters to it as well. "D:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\emacs-28.1\bin\runemacs.exe" %* 
 I began getting this error whenever I tried to list ELPA packages:
 Failed to verify signature archive-contents.sig: No public key for _____________ created at 2022-10-18T08:05:04+1100 using RSA Command output: gpg: keyblock resource '/d/Dropbox/Apps/emacs/.emacs.d/d:/Dropbox/Apps/emacs/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/pubring.kbx': No such file or directory gpg: Signature made Tue Oct 18 08:05:04 2022 AUSEST gpg: using RSA key _________________ gpg: Can't check signature: No public key 
 My googling led me to this Stack Exchange thread which noted that this was caused by the homedir expansion producing an invalid directory path.
 The fix in my init.el is therefore:
 (setq package-gnupghome-dir "elpa/gnupg") 
 This creates the keys in the directory that Emacs expects (.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/) and allows the whole thing to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using an alist as a means of counting occurrences of characters in a string. However, the values associated with a key in the alist are persistent across function calls, even though I reset the alist in a let form (and, well, it's inside a function!). Here is a minimal working example. Calling my/test multiple times continually increases the alist values:
 (defun my/test () (let ((my/alist '((a . 0) (b . 0)))) (incf (alist-get 'a my/alist)) (incf (alist-get 'b my/alist)) my/alist)) 
 What am I doing wrong? Something tells me the problem is with incf, but I cannot understand how my/alist is stored in memory, since it should have its scope inside the function and be reset when let is run.

 I know with record syntax we can create 
 data somedata ={ sum:: String, sum:: Int}
 What's stopped me from using Haskell for my everyday data science projects was with record syntax I would to modify things so the types and headers to the csv files matched.
 Which is a pain if I am just wanting to download data and play with it.
 Is there a way to create types, say similar to a Dataframe in Python or R where you can turn a CSV to a DataFrame?

Anyone do this today, or have advice on how to configure Eglot for the kernel? All I have ever used is cscope and ctags. I'd like to get it working so that the LSP server picks up the correct headers for the build arch and picks up all the GCC flags.
 I also usually run my builds inside of a container so I don't use my system's gcc toolchain.
 I am not an Emacs wizard, so detailed instructions for an idiot are most welcome.

 This should really be accompanied by a blog post, and it's kinda there in my notes. Would love some feedback.

 I decided to propose a Haskell devroom (like a one/half-days pecialist track or miniconf) for FOSDEM 2023, to be held February 4--5 in Brussels (main site; call-for-devrooms). It would be great to promote Haskell among this audience and hopefully attract new contributors / community members.
 Unfortunately I left it quite late (deadline submission is today). I only just realised I need a secondary contact (i.e. co-organiser) to submit the proposal. So... any volunteers?
 Ideally you are located in Europe or definitely planning to attend FOSDEM. If you are willing, please message me here on Reddit or mail frase at frase dot id dot au. I think I all need right now is your name and email address (and enthusiasm).
 The text of my proposal may be found at https://github.com/frasertweedale/talks/blob/master/2022-02-xx-fosdem-haskell-devroom/proposal.md.
 I have experience organising and hosting FP miniconfs at linux.conf.au including running the CFP etc. I expect FOSDEM will be similar, just on the other side of the world from Australia, where I live.
 Thank you!

 No problem, I thought, I'll just create a parallel directory structure and symlink things in places, and then import that into lsp. However, at some point in the process of importing the project (based on Maven pom files) it canonicalises some paths and ends up importing the original directory structure.
 I realise this is more of an underlying Eclipse issue, rather than an Emacs one, but does anybody have a good suggestion for how to work round this?

 The issue is that when the file is moved, the buffer opened doesn't really know about it and after any change in the buffer and then save, the file gets saved into old location.
 How do I associate a buffer with new location? I found somewhere that I can use `write-file` function and it suppose to change "the pointer" to file but it didn't. It does write to specified location but save-buffer still saves it into old file.

 If so, any alternative projects recommended?

Briefly, what’s Monad-Bayes about? Like Church, Gen and
Pyropyro (among other probabilistic programming languages), it allows a user
to specify a Bayesian model as a program, and automates the process of
inferring the specified distribution. Unlike other languages, it is a
first-class library of its host language (Haskell), rather than an embedded
language. This means that any language feature in the host language is
available to you. It also means that you can have distributions over absolutely

 Does anybody know of any good resources that go over what the general design patterns are, best practices, and tips on debugging?
 (Search engines haven't been much help as most combinations of 'emacs' and 'C code' lead to results about configuring Emacs as an IDE for C)
 I am pretty familiar with Emacs-Lisp, and I can write and understand C pretty well, but I would like to get a good understanding of all the Emacs-specific things I'm seeing in the C code, such as how to go from C variables and structs to Lisp objects, the DEFUN macro, etc.
 The motivation behind this is that, as noted in a previous post, I've noticed that the xwidget-webkit feature is (partially) broken in the latest version for MacOS. I would like to try out some possible fixes: it looks like most issues are simply due to the fact that many functions are only defined for the GTK framework, and not Mac's NextStep/Cocoa framework.
 Also, if anybody wants to help out with this effort, please let me know.
 ​
 UPDATE:
  
if you're interested in understanding Emacs C source-code, take a look at this section of the official manual: I found the part about Writing Emacs Primitives especially helpful. Many thanks to u/7890yuiop!!!
 If you're interested in the xwidget patches I'm working on, I've created this fork of the emacs mirror. I don't know if I'll be able to fix everything, but it's looking good and I've already implemented the estimated-load-progress function

 https://github.com/keithfancher/haskell-notes/blob/master/haskell-notes.md
 These are some notes I started taking about Haskell, specifically about topics I found confusing or which seemed to have many disparate sources of documentation. There's stuff about installation, toolchain, and of course some oddities of the language itself. It collects some basic summaries of the info that I've gleaned so far and a bunch of links to stuff written by people a lot more knowledgeable than I am.
 Of course, to reiterate: I am a beginner. So take it all with a grain of salt! But that can also be useful, since I probably have a similar perspective to all the other beginners out there.
 Also note that it's a work in progress! It'll grow as I continue to learn (and write down) new stuff.
 Anyway, hope this helps somebody!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! 
 I am learning Haskell because I've heard so many great things. I had heard of the language before but Software Unscripted has inspired me to pursue it seriously and dedicate some time to it. 
 So far it's really interesting! I've not had that "ah-ha!" moment but it's only been a week or so. 
 One thing I'm wondering: Can I change the cabal output directory? 
 Right now the output goes to:
  /home/chris/projects/MyPackage-CLI/dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-9.0.2/MyPackage-CLI-0.1.0.0/x/MyPackage-CLI/build/MyPackage-CLI/MyPackage-CLI 
 That is a mouthful lol! I suppose it doesn't matter until I need to deploy (thanks to cabal run) but I am curious to know if I can just have a ~/projects/MyPackage-CLI/bin/MyPackage-CLI -- or something like that. 
 Any ideas? I've searched around and mostly I've found ways of changing cabal itself, not the output or bin directory. 
 Thanks in advance!

In emacs i got this indentation in a file. When i clicking tab it was directly going 15 space forward after std::cout << "enter another: ";. The situation persist in just one file. Any idea what did this happen?

 I just released a fork of all-the-icons-completion. I've added support for more completion categories (imenu, M-x, and more) by taking code from all-the-icons-ivy-rich. I've also added a few quality of life improvements, like proper icon aligning and scaling (once again ported from all-the-icons-ivy-rich). If you use all-the-icons-completion I'd recommend giving my fork a try.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need help to track down an issue but I don't know how to proceed. 
 A specific combination of things makes lsp-mode (with lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode) cause lines below the cursor to move. Those circumstances are: 
  
Using one of the themes from Prot's package ef-themes
 
cc-mode with lsp-mode, lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode 
  
There is no problem with the identical configuration using haskell/lsp-haskell or python/lsp-pyright or any other language. 
 Nor is there a problem using a different theme e.g. modus-vivendi 
 This video shows 3 short clips to demonstrate the problem. 
  
theme: ef-dark, editing a C file showing the unwanted movement
 
identical setup after using counsel-load-theme and choosing modus-vivendi- no unwanted movement
 
theme: ef-dark, but editing a haskell file again using lsp-mode with lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode - no unwanted movement
 
 I'm stuck now and looking for ideas to help me discover what could cause this and how to fix it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Start emacs -Q, create an .org file somewhere with the following contents and add it to the agenda (with org-agenda-file-to-front, say): 
 #+TODO: TODO WAIT | DONE * TODO This is a test :work: * WAIT This is another test :work: 
 Run (org-tags-view nil "work+TODO=\"WAIT\"") and you will see, as expected, an agenda view containing only the task tagged "WAIT". 
 Quit the agenda and call org-todo-list, then run org-agenda-filter, and enter work+TODO="WAIT" at the prompt. Do you get the exact same result? I had assumed I would, but I do not. Instead I get this message: 
 ‘+TODO’ filter ignored because tag/category is not represented 
 So, questions: 
  
Is this as it should be? 
 Is there a way of using org-agenda-filter to filter out tasks with a specific todo keyword?
  
I realize I could do this: 
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("p" "Test" tags "+work+TODO=\"WAIT\""))) 
 or perhaps use org-agenda-filter-by-regexp. My question is just whether org-agenda-filter should allow me to find all entries with a particular todo keyword, and if not, I guess I'd want to know why not?

I pop the disk into my computer; and while the computer recognizes it, it says the disk is unreadable. So I Google what emacs even is. He was into coding, and was even trying to create his own pixel art computer game thing. I figure the backup could be related to that kind of stuff.
 How do I get this CD to open? I installed emacs on my computer (I think?) and nothing changed? 
 (I do realize he could have also used it as a journal. Honestly, I want answers to questions, and I'll never get them, now. Part of me hopes it is his journal. I'm already in therapy so it would just be one more thing to discuss, I guess. I won't let my mom know. I'm desperate. Thank you.)

I set up my environment following the course but it seems that my code is trying to compile Scala 2 rather than Scala 3.
 When I run the following code in IntelliJ: 
 val x = 10 if x < 0 then println("negative") else if x == 0 then println("zero") else println("positive") 
 I get this error:
 /Users/myname/Desktop/miscellaneous/courses/functional_programming_principles/scala-project/src/main/scala/example/example.worksheet.sc:3:4 '(' expected but identifier found. if x < 0 then 
 When I run scala --version in my terminal I get Welcome to Scala 3.2.0 (11.0.16.1, Java OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM) and my REPL also works in Scala 3. 
 I'm sure this is related but I'm not sure how to fix it:
  
In IDEA, under External Libraries, OpenJDK 18 and Scala SDK 2.13.10 are listed.
  
Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks
 EDIT: I fixed the issue by simply starting a new project and following the IDEA new project wizard. Helped me select the JDK and Scala version that I wanted. Thanks!

Overall, things are working pretty well, but I'm having trouble when using *Buffer List* (you know, the buffer menu invoked with C-x C-b or :ls<cr>).
 When I use C-h k o, for example, it shows the proper mapping defined in evil-collection: o is mapped to tabulated-list-sort.
 However, if I use C-h m, it says o is "Select that buffer in another window". And when I invoke which-key-show-mode, is says o is mapped to Buffer-menu-other-window.
 Am I missing something here? Is there a package that "glues" all the help systems together?

 Consumption of social media typically necessitates few repeated actions - like, share, comment and follow. If these actions are assigned to convenient keyboard keys, the consumption becomes easier. Here's an attempt to unify this experience using GNU Emacs and tumblesocks.

 I have all of the above installed --- and working. With Golang, the functions autocomplete with the parenthesis and placeholders for the args, as expected. So the plumbing works.
 But, when working with Javascript (with ts-ls), the functions and methods autocomplete without parenthesis or placeholders. So, for exemple, "document.querySel" autcompletes to "document.querySelector" -- NOT "document.querySelector(selectors)" or something like that.
 Again: yasnippet is installed and working and the entire thing works in other languages. Does anyone know why it doesn't work with Javascript?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a novice emacs user. In an attempt to set the font in my init.el file, I came across two different functions: set-fontset-font and set-frame-font.
 set-frame-font sets the font of current frame correctly, whereas set-fontset-font doesn't do anything. To my understanding, invoking (set-fontset-font t ...) is basically modifying the default font set, making new frames to use the font I specified, so this behavior is surprising to me.
 I frequently fiddle with code that contains non-alphanumeric characters (Hangul, Hiragana/Katakana, Emoji...), and I use different fonts for each of them. It would be great if I can use set-fontset-font as that function has this feature built-in. Is there a way to make it a one-function-to-rule-them-all?
 P.S. I tried modifying default-frame-alist with (font . "fontset-default") but apparently that is not allowed? Now my init.el is broken!

 I am learning using Org Mode and I wanted to cycle through single Headlines by using the Tab key but what I can only cycle through is the first level under the Headline I am pressing the Tab key upon.
 To clarify, I don't want to use the S-Tab to cycle through all Headlines, but I only want to cycle through one Headline and its sub-headlines.
 How can I cycle through all nested Headlines, one by one, with evil mode
 I am sorry if that's a pretty noob question. Thank you all for your help
 Edit: I've found in the manual a workaround (which is actually the official combo key for the action I was looking for) by using C-c C-k. That key combo will expand all subtrees of a headline, recursively. To close the main headline back, I'll use za.
 Sadly, default vim z operations in evil-org look not working. E.G. zO is supposed to perform the operation I was looking for, or zr doesn't open one subtree at a time.
 Edit 2: In the lang: org README file from Doom Emacs I see that this behavior was intentional and that can be reversed.
  
 TAB was changed to toggle only the visibility state of the current subtree, rather than cycle through it recursively. This can be reversed with:  #+begin_src emacs-lisp (after! evil-org (remove-hook 'org-tab-first-hook #'+org-cycle-only-current-subtree-h)) #+end_src

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past month I've been working on implementing my first OOP language with Haskell .. implementing the syntax and context analysis was very easy for me because I'm very aware of the fact that we build parsers using stateful monads using one of the already available libraries (like parsec for example)... so that went easy after defining the context-free grammars that is not left-recursive, and then implementing the parsec-functions to every non-terminating symbol in the grammars... so that went easy with no hiccups... 
 But after I dived into the context analysis that's where shit hit the fan.. it seemed that my programming model has either been very bad or I'm a bad software-engineer because functions started to become very ugly due to many parameters that are passed to the functions, and many other reasons that I don't how to start to explain, but in summary whatever makes haskell beautiful I managed to make it very ugly and complicated with my architecture design..
 So my question is: we already have stateful monads and parsers like parsec as an architectural model to implement the syntax analysis and context analysis. Are there also standardized models to implement the other steps in compilers like the context analysis? Is there literature that answers this question in regard to Haskell?
 Edit: while implementing the context analysis I became very aware of the fact that need zippers because I needed to be very aware ot the context of every variable and method which then I did and made the job much easier, so maybe that's part of the answer that I'm seeking?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "snapshot" binaries of Emacs 29 for Windows posted today should be somewhat less fragile while running without GCC/libgccjit (e.g. MSYS2 installed and on the Windows path).
 https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-29/?C=M;O=D
 Note: the snapshot is dated Oct 13, 2022, but I posted it today, Oct 15th; took me a few days. The last included commit was cbd04ad3d572850775f18bde868c71abcde733ed.
 Anyway, this build use a new "trampolines" target for make. This target pre-compiles (AOT) trampolines, infrastructure that allows natively compiled elisp to call redefined elisp primitives, which are then included with the installer, zip and no-deps.zip distributables. While redefining primitives is discouraged, it does happen, especially via advice APIs.
 Including these trampolines should enable installing and running (e.g.) packages that advise elisp primitives. Previously (in all 29 snapshots and GNU windows binary distributions of Emacs 28) that might have failed because Emacs unconditionally creates trampolines on the fly if they do not exist when needed. Precompiling the trampolines should prevent Emacs from triggering async native compilation even when native-comp-available-p was returning nil, to make them.
 TIA for bug reports & feedback!
 PS, in case others are building Emacs with native comp enabled and not distributing GCC/libgcc with, the new make target isn't on the Emacs 28 branch (yet). It should be fairly easy to patch it in or manually add something like this to your packaging process after success of make all, before make install (or make install-strip or whtv)
  (mapatoms (λ (f) (when (subr-primitive-p (symbol-function f)) (or (comp-trampoline-search f) (comp-trampoline-compile f))))) 
 This code comes from message #50 in bug #58318, and worked for me (however, the 29 snapshot binaries do use the new make target, now - they don't use the above snippet).
 Edit: un-mangled the code block

This is because it’s often hard to know whether the word or symbol I’m searching for is a substring of the word or symbol (especially in a coding environment).
 I’m especially wanting this functionality for completions for dabbrev and lisp symbols. I’m new to completion-at-point-functions, so I was hoping to get some help from the community. Thank you!

 My problem now is with midnight-mode.
 I copied what I found in the EmacsWiki into my init file, changing calendar to diary-mail-entries:
 (require 'midnight)
 (midnight-delay-set 'midnight-delay "4:30am")
 (add-hook 'midnight-hook 'diary-mail-entries)
 My problem is, not only do I get email at 4:30am but each and every time I start emacs.
 If anyone knows what I may be doing wrong or how to correct this I would appreciate it.

 When I use control +/- I can only zoom in up to the font size I set in ~/.doom.d/config.el (doom user here) then it just says "The font hasn't been resized" (not big of an explanation).
 I zoom out and on the right bottom corner it tells me how many "steps" I zoomed back ( (-1), (-2), etc.), and when I press C-+ even just one time it takes me back to "0" ie the default font size I set.
 This what I have in my config regarding fonts.
 ;; ----------- FONTS ----------- ;; main font stuff (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Comic Mono" :size 24) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Ubuntu" :size 24) doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Comic Mono" :size 24)) ;; make italics and bold show without the slash and asterisk (not working) (after! doom-themes (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t doom-themes-enable-italic t)) ;; italic comments and keywords (not working) (custom-set-faces! '(font-lock-comment-face :slant italic) '(font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic)) 
 I'm sorry if the question is high noobeness, I'm not very practical with this and I don't have any idea of how to move forward. I love editing org files in emacs though, so these headaches are worth it.
 Thank you all.

One of the greatest difficulties in understanding the Zettelkasten Method is to separate its specific characteristics from actual knowledge work. Or, how I like to phrase it: “Link knowledge, not notes.” Working with our Zettelkasten is the physical (or digital) manifestation of our thinking. It provides a framework that allows us to think through writing and to create an increasingly complex thinking machine that can help us think deeper than being on our own. The Zettelkasten Method provides a framework for our thinking, but does not prescribe what and how we think.

Start typing @ and get an auto-complete helm box with all the people I have in the system. Selecting one would should the nickname I defined for them in this sytem
 Have a capture template (for example when creating a meeting) where I can select the people I have in the system (multi-select) and assign them to a "with" property under the meeting heading
 Click on a @-link and see all the headings under which this person is mentioned.
 Assign a TODO to someone and later see all the TODOs by them (today I do this with tags but it doesn't work well with people with the same first names unless my tags keep a @first_lastname pattern for everyone) Closest I have seen so far is this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/64502 but it's part of a much more complex package which seems overkill. Plus, I don't see how I could easily use with a capture template.
  
Any ideas? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At random points during the day I see the following error message: 
 file-notify--call-handler: Symbol’s function definition is void 
 Unfortunately, I cannot figure out what the source of this is. I've tried all sorts of things, including
 (setq debug-on-message "file-notify--call-handler: Symbol’s function definition is void") 
 and setting debug-on-error to t. But I keep getting these messages (overnight, the message popped up about 29 times, according to the messages buffer) with no explanation. 
 Any suggestions on what else I can try here?
 EDIT: I realized I failed to add the last bit of the message. It actually reads: 
 file-notify--call-handler: Symbol’s function definition is void: nil

 I'm running into issues with a missing instance of MonadUnliftIO Handler when I introduce ResourceT. The stack is a custom monad that runs with Servant.
 This is my stack and runner (precisely how I make the composition work remains a WIP):
 ```haskell newtype AppObs a = AppObs { iniApp :: ReaderT Env (ResourceT (LoggingT Handler)) a } deriving ( Functor , Applicative , Monad , MonadReader Env , MonadIO , MonadLogger , MonadThrow , MonadCatch -- , MonadError Text Already defined by Server )
 -- ** > Custom monad -> Handler -- | -- Natural transformation required to map the custom monad back to Handler. nat :: Env -> AppObs a -> Handler a nat env app = runStderrLoggingT (runResourceT ( runReaderT (iniApp app) env ))
 ```
 Any guidance or comments would be welcome.

 If core domain object is near service and repository then that module must include the dependency to the SQL or other database library. Now if your other project doesn't use SQL but they need your core object it will drag all the libraries with it.
 If you separate out the core domain class into a submodule that doesn't contain any dependencies, then you can import that to other projects, but then it's suddenly not package-by-feature. Or can we achieve a hybrid model where the core object is separate and then all the rest, SQL, HTTP, API, JSON are in one other module that is the app.

 type mismatch; found : cmd.Persist (which expands to) XXXXEntity#Persist required: XXXXEntity.this.Persist .onCommand[XXXXCommand, XXXXCreatedReply] { case (cmd: XXXXCommand, ctx, state) => cmd.apply(ctx, state) } 
 ​
 I created A Command interface and created Commands from it.
 trait XXXXCommands[R] extends ReplyType[R] { override type ReplyType = Rtype Context = XXXXEntity#CommandContext[ReplyType]type State =XXXXStatetype Persist = XXXXEntity#Persist def apply(ctx: Context, stateOpt: Option[State]): Persist = {stateOpt match {case None => initial(ctx)case Some(state) if state.XXXXStatus == XXXXStatus.Success => success(ctx, state)}} protected def rejectByStatus(ctx: Context, state: State): XXXXEntity#Persist = {ctx.invalidCommand(s"${this.getClass.getSimpleName}: Invalid operation. {Id: ${state.XXXXId}, Status: ${state.XXXXStatus}")ctx.done} protected def reject(message: String, ctx: Context): XXXXEntity#Persist = {ctx.invalidCommand(message)ctx.done} protected def initial(ctx: Context): XXXXEntity#Persistprotected def success(ctx: Context, state: State): XXXXEntity#Persist} 
 I am using (or trying to use) Lagom framework. Persist is a trait that is inside of the PersistentEntity trait. Because of the the inner traits I tried to take the Persist inside the Entity that I created via hash (#) operation. That may be the problem.
 I dont know how could I fix it but its so weird to have that problem. This would exactly work in java but why it did not in scala?
 Edit:
 It happens when I try to run the code below.
 override def behavior: Behavior = Actions().onCommand[XXXXCommand, XXXXCreatedReply] { case (cmd: XXXXCommand, ctx, state) => cmd.apply(ctx, state) }

In the coming weeks I'm considering releasing my hyper-minimal take on Zettelkasten to a wider audience. My rationale has always been to squash complexity in favor of a quick & lightweight method of retrieving notes (nothing at all wrong with other apps that have all the bells & whistles btw). The same codebase runs on any of Windows, Linux, BSD (Apple likely to be included soon as well) with zero issues.
Some screen shots...



The interface as you noticed is commandline driven & features a REPL (Read Evaluate Print & Loop) to process commands. As it stands now, the source code is merely 27 Kilobytes in size & would be great to toss on a USB drive so your notes are easy to access. No smartphone interface as I'm not much interested in that domain. At any rate, if this sounds like something you might be interested in, check in every now & again & I'll hopefully post a download link eventually.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I want to write a simple converter from lambda calculus expressions to SKI expressions using these 6 rules. I have my two types
 data Expr = Var String | Abs String Expr | App Expr Expr data SKI = S | K | I | App SKI SKI 
 With these types, rule 5 does not quite work using general recursion:
 general :: Expr -> SKI general (Abs v1 (Abs v2 e)) | free v1 e = general (Abs v1 $ general (Abs v2 e)) 
 Understandably, this doesn't work because Abs requires its second arg to be an Expr but general returns SKI.
 I've tried implementing it using various recursion schemes (futu, histo, para and ana), but to no success. Is there a way to do this without having to merge the two types together into one?
 And additionally, if something can't be implemented using general recursion, can it be implemented using recursion schemes? Or is general recursion strictly "more powerful"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found that completing-read + embark-act-all rocks. For example, I can update all lsp-related package in straight.el by calling straight-pull-package and then type lsp- to get a list of completion candidates with lsp in the name. Then I call embark-act-all and pull all the selected packages.
 But it would be useful to be able to switch from an arbitrary completing-read minibuffer into completing-read-multiple via a key-press, collect multiple candidates (which don't necessarily have matching substrings), and then just run the original command for each of the selected candidates, e.g. via embark-act-all. This would be much more convenient than just running the command multiple times or what I sometimes do, mapping the function over the list in elisp (M-: (seq-map #'<command> candidates))
 I could write my own function which calls completing-read-multiple, like straight-pull-package-crm, but it would be nice if something like that would be possible from any command. I'm asking because I thought something like that should already exist somewhere or be possible somehow with existing functionality in emacs/embark.
 Feel free to propose other solutions to my problem, as what I'm asking might be an XY problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I just attended a job‍ that was largely JVM-focused. I'm not new to the JVM; I've done previous work in Java (1.6/Android) and spent a large chunk of time writing Clojure. My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I'll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I'd feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I've also been there and done that, and I like types now. Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We're a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. I'm looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general. I'm not opposed to pragmatism either; it's one thing I like about Scala. It seems like there's a lot of excellent libraries because of the existing JVM ecosystem. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To me, I've always thought that data constructors should have a lowercase first letter, because they are term-level and behave very similarly to functions. For example,
 data T = D Int f :: Int -> T f = D 
 Here, f and D are very similar conceptually, so why should they be represented differently?
 I've read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6237775/why-does-haskell-force-data-constructors-first-letter-to-be-upper-case but the only compelling argument to me seems to be pattern matching, since data constructors can be matched on but functions cannot. However as someone who learnt haskell recently it seems to me that it would be clearer if data constructors had a lower case first letter to make clear their term-levelness.

 I’m very efficient in Scala 2, good old runtime-programming and FP, but macro always felt like something not to touch in Scala 2.
 Now there’s Scala 3, and metaprogramming seems to go mainstream. The problem though is that I cannot get used to programming at compile-time. Everything I have in my project is someone else’s copypasta. I’ve read the docs and few blogposts, but still not capable to write it myself. 
 I’m looking for small Scala 3 exclusive (mixing it with 2 makes much harder to distinguish) projects with use of metaprogramming where I can learn more and perhaps contribute. Ducktape (https://github.com/arainko/ducktape) is a great example. Any blog posts would be even better.

stateful systems using traces — sequences of stateful actions — that can be
combined and modified to write complex test cases easily and transparently. This
post elaborates on the combinators used to generate new traces from previously
existing traces.
Writing generators for property-based tests is an art, and there’s often a
trade-off between how many test cases are generated and how meaningful each of
them is. When considering stateful systems, this problem is exacerbated, because
any action taken now may constrain the available actions for the future. This
means that the test generator will already need to track how the state evolves
from each step to the next in order to generate valid inputs. We think that

Vuiet is supposed to show playing track information on the modeline - right about where you’d normally have line/char line counts. Mine very rarely does this; I haven’t exactly pinned it down, but SOME buffers will actually show this information. It doesn’t seem to be vuiet-specific ones exactly, but I think that might be it. 
 I’d really appreciate any suggestions for where I could look to pull that info out of vuiet and add it to my modeline. 
 I tried placing (vuiet-update-mode-line) in the modeline config variable (forget the exact name) but that didn’t help. 
 Sometimes when I run the command manually I can actually see it for what looks like a frame or two.

 ```cabal library exposed-modules: MyLib build-depends: base >=4.14.3.0 hs-source-dirs: src default-language: Haskell2010
 test-suite test type: exitcode-stdio-1.0 main-is: Test.hs build-depends: base >=4.14.3.0 , my-lib hs-source-dirs: test default-language: Haskell2010 ```
 I want to test a "private" function from MyLib. The function is not supposed to be exported by the module. But of course then I can't import the function from my test suite. What's the standard way to deal with this? 
  
Put the tests together with MyLib and export the tests? 
 Make a dedicated module just to re-export the "public" functions and for all other modules just export everything? 
 Never test private functions?
  
All of these options seem flawed to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: I need to specify a :files value inside the use-package form, but this has irritating side-effects.
 I install packages with straight and use-package.
 I use the transient package. I noticed that its info manual didn't appear for me with C-h i. I dug deeper and realized that .../straight/build/transient didn't contain a dir file or any of the doc files. Several other packages, like orderless, did include dir in their straight/build directories, but their repo directories also happen to store the doc files at the top level.
 transient is different in that its repo has a docs/ subdirectory, which seemed to be the source of the problem. But magit has a similar repo structure, and its docs were installing fine.
 I noticed that the recipe for magit has a :files key which pulls in the doc file. Adding
 :straight (:files (:defaults "docs/*")) 
 to my (use-package 'transient ...) form appears to do the trick - and automagically triggers a make docs command for transient somehow - but now I have two wrinkles:
  
straight rebuilds transient every time I start Emacs
 I get a warning "Warning (straight): Two different recipes given for "transient" (:files cannot be both nil and (:defaults "docs/*"))"
  
The first issue is annoying, but isn't a showstopper. I don't restart Emacs very often and my startup time is already slow.
 The second issue worries me, because I don't know whether it means that updated docs will actually get installed in the future. Presumably the clash is between my (use-package 'transient ...) and the recipe that gets used when transient is handled as a dependency of magit (which I also use). But which recipe is actually used to install transient now? Is it getting installed twice every time?
 I don't know why the transient docs aren't getting installed "out of the box" as they apparently are for everyone else. What might I be doing wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I’m pretty new to scala and the usage of underscore to simplify lambdas seems a little obscure to me. For example I can write this:
  readLine.split(" ").map(_.toInt)  And it works as expected, but then I try:  vertices(v).filter(!(visited(_))  and the compiler would complain:
  
value unary_! is not a member of Int => Boolean
  
So I end up writing my lambda expressions with _ and if I see an error then I expand them to “true” lambdas like:  vertices(v).filter(vertex => !(visited(vertex)) 
 This is a little frustrating, so what I want to know, is, what are the rules that the underscore syntax OK in the first case, but wrong in the second one?

 This the another mode or command that can detect and print out the home and end keys?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write FFI bindings for librrd. My code can be found here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/tree/context-bindings
 This is the first time I use FFI and I have not come very far. I can query the version of the library and do some calls to rrd_*_error which run but return empty results. So I'm not even sure I am missing something very basic here.
 This is what I observe: The tests in general run fine, until I enable the one defined here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/blob/context-bindings/test/RRDTool/LowLevelSpec.hs#L41 which calls rrd_get_context. The tests simply crash then:
 $ cabal test --test-show-details=always Running 1 test suites... Test suite hs-rrd-test: RUNNING... Test suite hs-rrd-test: FAIL 
 Started in a repl I get the following:
 ghci> :add *RRDTool.LowLevel Ok, two modules loaded. ghci> rrd_get_context cabal: repl failed for hs-rrd-0.1.0.0. The build process segfaulted (i.e. SIGSEGV). 
 The code of rrd_get_context can be found here: https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_thread_safe.c#L43 It basically does some calls to pthread.
 Can someone help on what to do next?
 EDIT: I looked into this a bit deeper. The problem actually does not seem to be the calls to pthread, but the way I read the rrd_context_t in Haskell (i.e. the peek). I changed my test to simply call the raw functions in C and look at the returned pointer address. That works ok and I do not get a null pointer. So I guess it has to be the peek which triggers the segmentation fault.
 This also happens when I simply call rrd_new_context which according to the C code ( https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_error.c#L121) only does a malloc and then returns the pointer.
 So either the memory pointed to is already taken away from my process (not sure what the proper wording is here) or my Storable instance is broken.

I've been trying to configure my init.el for org and org-roam, and I've gotten to where emacs starts without any error, I can open org-mode and I can open org-roam-mode. Then I'm stuck. Well, I did find that in org I can hit C-x C-f and open a *.org file and enter outline stuff, and save it, but I'm baffled by org-roam. Let's say I found some interesting ideas in the comment section of a blog in my browser. I assume that to record the note (zettel) I need to start emacs and get into org-roam-mode. What do I do then? I mean, what keys to I press to open a new note? How do I specify the type of note (main or reference, I'm starting out small)? Is there a tutorial anywhere that gives this kind of instruction for org-roam or zettelkasten?

 I'm currently moving my time tracking to org-mode after already using it for a few years.
 So far I've managed ok to transition/integrate org-mode in my caldav workflow.
 I found few problems that I have questions on:
  
I've used timestamps such as the one below in some entries however they don't seem to appear in my agenda buffer: <%%(and (diary-cyclic 14 31 3 2022) (diary-block 31 3 2022 30 3 2022)) 07:00-08:30> Is there anything that I need to do so that entries using those appear in my agenda?
 I've then tried to use something like `<2022-03-31 Do 07:00-08:00 UTC +2w> that works however if I include -1d to get a notification a day before they agenda doesn't show it for some reason.
 How does org-mode deal with timezones? I get some calendar invites that contain different timezones.

The third is much better, but it doesn't satisfy the second condition: for input "az" it returns "expecting 'ac'", but not "expecting 'ab' or 'ac'". It's interesting, that if the first symbol doesn't match (for example, for "z"), the desired behavior is achieved. However, this is not enough in my case. How can I do this?
 This is my test code: ``` parsers :: [Parser String] parsers = [ optional ab >> ac , try (optional ab) >> ac , optional (try ab) >> ac ] where ab = string "a" >> string "b" ac = string "ac"
 strs :: [String] strs = ["abac", "ac", "z", "az"]
 test :: IO () test = for_ (parsers zip [1 ..]) $ (p, i) -> do putStrLn $ "parser " <> show i <> ":" for_ strs $ \str -> do putStrLn $ "string "<> show str <> ":" parseTest p str ```
 P.S. I've tried to write my one combinator for this issue, using observing or setState/getState, but have not achieved anything.

 Those counters would be live and would change depending on presses of C-s and C-r.
 I'd prefer counters instead of using avy and playing game of pressing assigned letter. You can very quickly press C-s or C-r given number of times without making a mistake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to be able to actively recall my notes and review them on a regular basis, and I haven’t figured out how to implement them in my notes.
 I read Doubleloop’s blog post on his workflow, but as he stated in the improvement section,
  
I feel like I’m maintaining the flashcards separately from the body of my notes – it’s a bit of a duplication of effort. It’d be good to get a flow where the flashcard is just part of the note as is, and I can pull it out without duplicating it.
  
I tried to manipulate it a bit, and my current workflow is incorporating it directly into my notes.
 Take this note, for example, about Edge Devices,
 * Definition :PROPERTIES: :ANKI_DECK: Computer Networking :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic :ANKI_NOTE_ID: 1665541877624 :END: ** Front What are Edge Devices? ** Back - They are known as End-sytems or Hosts. These devices are divided into two groups: Clients and Servers. - These are the devices that recieves the internet as a service. *And, then here I continue with some more examples on the topic.* 
 And then I export it to Anki for reviewing.
 My question here is this a good workflow in the long run, as all my notes would take this shape?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So I use both ef-themes and modus-themes by Prots as my themes, and I really like the fact that we can customize the org-mode headings by level.
 This is done with this configuration (from ef-themes manual)
 (setq ef-themes-headings ; read the manual's entry or the doc string '((0 . (variable-pitch light 1.9)) (1 . (variable-pitch light 1.8)) (2 . (variable-pitch regular 1.7)) (3 . (variable-pitch regular 1.6)) (4 . (variable-pitch regular 1.5)) (5 . (variable-pitch 1.4)) ; absence of weight means `bold' (6 . (variable-pitch 1.3)) (7 . (variable-pitch 1.2)) (t . (variable-pitch 1.1)))) 
 As far as I understand, we can only configure 8 level, I thought that the last line would set the themes for every subsequent level, but this is not the case in my experience. When I create a ninth level heading, it goes back to the style of the first level.
 This make it weird and not really attractive with file with many levels of subheadings.
 ​
 I don't know if we can overcome this limitation, if so I would be interested in knowing how.
 My second thought was to disable the theming in a specific buffer. But I wasn't able to do it by making the variable local. Is there a way to do that ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Usually, one doesn't encounter new simple monads in the wild, they're nearly all combinations of existing transformers. But I don't know of an existing transformer capturing this:
 data RandomT m a = RandomT { getRandomT :: RandomSeed -> m a } split :: RandomSeed -> (RandomSeed, RandomSeed) instance Monad m => Monad (RandomT m) where RandomT action >>= f = RandomT $ \seed -> do let (seed', seed'') = split seed a <- action seed' getRandomT (f a) seed'' 
 On first glance, you'd say "wait, that's just a reader", but in fact it isn't because of the split function. This could be generalized with this type class:
 class CoSemigroup a where split :: a -> (a, a) 
 While there are no nontrivial comonoids in Haskell, could there be nontrivial semigroups (although I'm not sure whether random seeds are an example because of coassociativity)? If not, do random monads implemented this way actually obey the associativity laws?
 Is this transformer implemented in general somewhere?

OS I recently decided to start adding some extended features and working on my config. Eventually I managed to get lastfm.el and Vuiet working together and it’s awesome! I think I’ve figured out how to make a script with new keybinds for the Vuiet stuff I need to use, but some features are broken, namely searching songs by lyrics. I’m not sure how to debug emacs scripts so if anyone has any suggestions, including a better player, I’m open. Also, I’m shopping around for a completion module, mostly for Python but also C and HTML.
 Edit:
 Vuiet is cool, but seems like a lost cause. I think the only functionality EMMS doesn’t have that Vuiet did, though, is searching by artist for stuff I don’t actually have. 
 My main problem at this point is how to add an SMB share to EMMS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a bad dynamic in America's STEM education where kids going into college computer science out of high school hit a brick wall . . . largely made of math they've never seen before. In general, CS is not at all what they thought it would be. Then they switch/flunk out. So if higher-ed physics, engineering, math has a long, gentle preparatory on-ramp in K-12 with math, comp-sci has absolutely nothing -- or maybe just some "learn to code." And so I've been trying to put together a high-school-level on-ramp for real CS . And I'm basing it on Haskell. Why Haskell? Because the top-tier schools all do some sort of typed functional programming eventually. Functional seems to be the fault line between the top schools and the 2nd-tier. So for example I mix in discrete math with Haskell. You could say I'm high-school-izing the Doets, van Eijck text The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths, and Programming. Or even the Paulson ML for the Working Programmer, another fantastic book. Great, you might say. Trouble is I'm all alone -- as far as I know. For example, if you look at the AP Computer Science stuff, it's basically learn to program Java with a smattering of data structures and algorithms tacked on. Not really much help for a kid walking into Cornell or CMU. Every high school effort I've come across so far has hardly ever been more than "learn to code," typically Python. So my question to you is, should I keep going -- or give it up for a bad job? Am I really on to something, or am I tilting at windmills? The fact that I'm so alone on this is ominous. I've contacted lots of big name professors -- and they're sympathetic but in the long run apathetic simply because they're awash in 96th-percentile applicants. Yeah.... Your ideas would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I binded a function open-file-at-cursor. This allows me to open the file directly from a file (given I've written down the correct path). Now, I want to use something like this where I can give the file paths as environment variable. I've been struggling but couldn't find anything related to this. Please help!
 Edit: Noting down the use case for this
 Let's assume we have a file in path - /home/user/dir1/dir2/file.txt
 I've set some env variable $TEST=/home/user/dir1
 In some other file (let's name it file2.f under dir2), I've mentioned following two lines:
 ../file.txt
 $TEST/dir2/file.txt
 With the "open-file-at-cursor" bind, I'm able to directly open a file.txt when my cursor is on 1st line. However, the same bind breaks down for line 2. I'm expecting both lines to open the same file. ffap does not solve my issue as it opens the final directory that holds my file(this will increase my keystrokes).
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody! Haskell caught my attention because of its powerful type system. I come from a math background so I thought it'd be fun to implement some theorems in abstract algebra in Haskell. From what I understand, there are classes of functions in Haskell like <> for example which represents an associative operation. What I'd really like is to implement a homomorphism type that sends f (x * y) to f(x) * f(y). The trouble I am having is that in mathematics we will always demand a proof that a map is a homomorphism before we give it its status as one. Is this not the case in Haskell? In other words, do we need to manually check that an operation is a homomorphism or is there some way for Haskell to recognize one (perhaps with a bit of assistance from the programmer/type system/something else)?

This can become a problem in any codebase, but there is a trick for NixOS configurations that makes the process a whole lot less stressful.

A NixOS system is defined by a configuration written in the Nix language.
The configuration sets various options and is evaluated into a build task for the system, which incorporates instructions for how to build, along with all the inputs they depend on.

 I want to create a database that keeps track of all people that have access to some data. The database is shared by a couple of organizations, sub groups of that organization and specific characters/addresses/people/user within that organization on one table.
 Traditionally I would just use a hashmap of some nature.. the hashmap could look up the user and we would know what organization they are apart of and we could easily remove that person from the organization access table.
 But if we have an organization of 10million addresses/users that seems like a bad idea.

To open the PDF output file you can now also use PDF Tools, a document viewer for Emacs. With it, as a plus, forward and backward search is accurate at word level.
  
I'm only able to achieve word-level accuracy on reverse sync search. On forward sync search, the arrow that appears in the left-hand margin of the PDF preview buffer can be off by as much as a half-dozen lines.
 Is there a way to configure AucTeX + PDF Tools in order to highlight the word in the PDF Tools preview buffer corresponding to where the cursor is positioned in the AucTeX latex source buffer during a forward search instead of placing an arrow in the left-hand margin, which by construction can only be line-level accurate at best?

 I know about occur-rename-buffer but that gives only the buffer name not the regexp. When I run ibuffer I see this: *Occur: init.el* and *Occur: init.el*<2>. That's not very practical. Something like: *Occur: init.el*<defun> and *Occur: init.el*<global-set-key> would be much better.
 I've found this: rename-occur-buffer-term which it does display the regexp but not the buffer-name :/ I tried to put both together but my e-lisp knowledge is very, very limited atm.

The pool is instantiated lazily with no open connections
 Connections are acquired when requested
 Each connection is exposed as an fs2.Stream[IO, R] where R is the type of the connection
 Each connection is checked for error before release–if error, then dispose of the connection instead of releasing it back into the pool
 The connection pool as a whole is instantiated as a Resource[IO, ConnectionPool[R]] and all open connections are released when the pool is released
  
I would appreciate if anyone could take a look at my code and offer any thoughts/feedback/critiques.

 My question really isn't different from this question that was asked six years ago:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I'm using Emacs 28.2 on windows and Emacs 28.1 on Mac. Same issue on both.
 Spacemacs wants to install evil-escape, but it does not seem to exist.
 https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-escape (Claims the package exists in Melpa)
 https://melpa.org/#/?q=esca (this query shows evil-escape does NOT exist in Melpa)
 https://melpa.org/#/?q=evil (this query also fails to find evil-escape)
 So... what da heck? I hate to do this improperly but do I need to manually download evil-escape from github (first link) and stick it in the .emacs.d folder myself? Or is Melpa broken? Or spacemacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title says most of it. I use a lot of latex equations that I label with #+NAME and reference with internal org links, as these work both in org-mode and turn into into latex references on export. The only thing missing is a quick way to be able to pick from previous equations to reference, like how reftex does it for normal .tex editing. Is there perhaps some existing library that solves this problem?

 I'd much rather have a repl running within emacs - and just be able to "eval line" or "eval region" as I'm going. 
 I have to assume someone in this amazing community has already figured this out - anyone know of any existing libraries/tutorials to hook this up?

 Ever wanted to write a function or command, but don't know what the functions for say manipulating buffers or getting file names are called?
 Version 28 of emacs introduced a new feature called shortdoc. It gives an overview over available elisp functions in a few select categories. Use the command M-x shortdoc-display-group and then type in which category you want to view and a buffer pops up giving you a brief overview.
 Give it a shot. Its great!

 I'm now getting to reading (and taking notes on) a number of publications in epub / pdf format mostly.
 I'd love to hear how everyone is dealing with references in books. My own (planned at this point) system would be to highlight passages in texts and paraphrase them in org-roam nodes.
 M-x highlight seems like the key here - is those highlights something I can reference from org-roam?
 bddean's ereader and nov.el look appealing, especially with nov-xwidget.el for formatting on the latter.
 Should I spend time exploring both of these, or am I missing the point?

I raised a ticket through Red Hat's security response channels at the time: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004547. For some reason got closed but u/juhp revived it and it finally got its CVE assignment: CVE-2022-3433.
 If you needed a canonical CVE reference for the library issue now you have one.

 Everywhere I edit text, I'd use the Vim keymap, it is already an extension of my mind in some way and I feel crampled when working without it.
 Lately, I've started building my Emacs config from scratch, to abstract myself from the computer I'm using and start gravitating towards using Emacs more as an OS rather than a code editor.
 I've been avoiding to use evil-mode and friends for two reasons:
  
I'd need to configure all the unimaginable keybindings to work properly with other packages (I'm aware of evil-collection though)
 I feel like the Emacs keybindings are designed like that in some way and that the part of the community that doesn't use evil works in the same level of efficiency or better due to tighter integration between packages.
  
My question would be: 
 Is it worth the effort I'm taking to learn the Emacs keybindings, or is it just "a different way of doing the same things"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy. It would be much easier for me to do my note-taking if org-roam-node-find had the following behavior: - Pressing TAB changes the text in the search bar to whatever the suggestion list has highlighted. I'd like it to just replace the entire thing instead of doing that default step-by-step completion if possible. - Pressing ENTER opens or creates the exact match of what's entered in the org-roam-node-find search bar. 
 Currently, I'm having some issues. My PKM note hierarchy uses dots as delimiters. Take the note res.lore.sw as an example (my note about Star Wars). I created it first. Now I want to create res.lore as an index for all the lores I've written about, but org-roam-node-find won't let me create it, because it matches with the Star Wars note and opens it. I'd instead like to be able to either press TAB to set the highlighted file as the new search, or press ENTER to open or create the exact note id entered into the search bar.
 My current org-roam config is pretty much the minimum:  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory "REDACTED") (org-roam-complete-everywhere t) (org-roam-capture-templates '(("d" "default" plain "%?" :if-new (file+head "${title}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n#+date: %U\n") :unnarrowed t))) :config (org-roam-setup) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to use eglot with the R language server. However, eglot does not seem to work well with either RMarkdown or Quarto documents as it hangs every time entering when enter a code chunk (up to 5 seconds or so). I am guessing it does this because it disconnects when entering the markdown mode and then needs to reconnect again. I am not sure. 
 I have two questions.
  
How might I be able to overcome this re-connection(?) issue with quarto or rmarkdown documents and still use eglot?
 Alternatively, how can I enable eglot just for *.r or *.R files and not just for ess-r-mode?

 (setq package-selected-packages '(use-package lsp-mode lsp-ui lsp-treemacs dap-mode company-mode flycheck prism aggressive-indent haskell-mode lsp-haskell)) 
 Then, I added this to my init.el (I use use-package):
 (use-package flycheck :init (global-flycheck-mode)) 
 However, even after doing that, when I open Emacs, I still get this error:
 Error (use-package): flycheck/:init: Symbol’s function definition is void: global-flycheck-mode
 It's strange, because even though I installed flycheck, the function seems to be undefined. The use-package configuration is what they recommend on their website, as well (scroll to find the use-package section), so I don't think the problem is calling (global-flycheck-mode).
 Does anyone have tips for what I should do next?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have a created a class called Task that contains SignalRef and then an instance from that class
 case class Task(id: String,, cancel: IO[SignallingRef[IO, Boolean]]) val task = Task(randomUUID().toString, SignallingRef[IO, Boolean](false)) 
 Thereafter, I put the task in a Map and calling it from two different streams.
 The first one is called from an HTTP request to set its value to “true”
  case DELETE -> Root / "tasks" / UUIDVar(taskId) => taskMap.get(taskId.toString) match { case Some(task) => for{ switch <- task.cancel _ <- switch.set(true).start >> IO.println("canceled") res <- Ok(task.toOutput.asJson) } yield res case None => NotFound("Not Found") 
 and the other one is called from a "stream.interruptWhen" to cancel the stream when the value become "true"
  val httpStream = for { cancelSwitch <- Stream.eval(task.cancel) httpStream <- client .stream(req) .flatMap(_.body) .through(decodeUsingHeaders[CsvRow[String]]()) .interruptWhen(cancelSwitch) .map(x => x.toMap) .map(x => x.asJson.noSpaces + "\n") .through(text.utf8.encode) .through(Files[IO].writeAll(Path(s"jsons/${task.id}.json"), Flags.Write)) } yield httpStream httpStream.compile.drain 
 And it appears that I am doing something wrong because they don't communicate with each other.
 P.S. I am Golang developer interested in the functional programming of Scala and its libraries CE3, FS2 and ZIO

org-mode outline, that you see whole content, like in google map, you see whole world and you can zoom in to see continents, then countries, cities, districts, streets etc. and then can easy zoom out.
 
textinfo you can only go to next/previous or direct node, page, section, paragraph, without zoom in zoom out

Are there more abstract concepts in Haskell? Such as higher category theory and the Yoneda lemma. I've heard category theory be described as the linguistics of mathematics, so it only makes sense for it to have actually been used on a language.

 For comparison, if I use the same body on a method, it works as expected. Appreciate any explanation or pointer to where I can read more about this.
 Note: I'm using Scala 2 in case that matter.
 lazy val sumVal: (Int, List[Int]) => Int = (acc, numbers) => numbers match { case head :: tail => sumVal(acc + head, tail) case _ => acc } def sum(acc: Int, numbers: List[Int]): Int = { numbers match { case head :: tail => sum(acc + head, tail) case _ => acc } } val numbers = List.fill(10000)(2) sum(0, numbers) // this works as expected sumVal(0, numbers) // this blows up with a stack overflow

 I use Doom Emacs with lsp enabled. 
 I develop in PHP using Laravel framework. There's a package called laravel-ide-helper that creates stub classes to help on IDE completion for properties and magic methods. 
 The problem is, when I x-ref-find I get two results, one for the correct method and another for the stub (they are all in a file called _ide_helper.php). 
 Is there a way I can filter out these results? Maybe blacklist the filename somehow?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I came across this stackoverflow post and tried to implement my own StateIO monad where I could perform IO actions. Here is my code:
 {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} import Control.Monad.Trans import Control.Monad (ap, liftM) newtype StateIO s a = StateIO {runStateIO :: s -> IO (a, s)} instance Functor (StateIO s) where fmap = liftM instance Applicative (StateIO s) where pure = return (<*>) = ap instance Monad (StateIO s) where return a = StateIO $ \s -> return (a, s) n >>= k = StateIO $ \s -> do (a, s') <- runStateIO n s runStateIO (k a) s instance MonadIO (StateIO s) where liftIO io = StateIO $ \st -> do x <- io return (x, st) class Monad m => MonadStateIO s m | m -> s where getSt :: m s putSt :: s -> m () instance MonadStateIO s (StateIO s) where getSt = StateIO $ \st -> return (st,st) putSt st = StateIO $ const $ return ((),st) 
 Then I run a simple program where the user inputs a positive integer n and I return the first n fibonacci numbers with the use of the StateIO monad. 
 type FibNums = [Int] main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "How many fibonacci numbers do you want to see:" n <- (read <$> getLine) :: IO Int let initialState = [n,0,1] process initialState process :: FibNums -> IO () process st = do (finished, newSt) <- runStateIO addFib st print finished -- for debugging print newSt -- for debugging if finished then do putStrLn "Fibonacci numbers are:" print $ tail newSt else process newSt addFib :: StateIO FibNums Bool addFib = do st <- getSt let newSt = st ++ [last st + last (init st)] finished = length (tail newSt) == head newSt liftIO $ print newSt -- for debugging putSt newSt return finished 
 The problem is in the function addFib the line "putSt newSt" does not really update the FibNums state variable and the initial state is returned. So the program loops on forever. 
 Any ideas what am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often find myself switching between Emacs and terminal (e.g. xterm). A typical example is to run a test suite after editing some code. For years, I've been looking for a clean way to send code directly to a terminal without copy-pasting, and I think I finally found it. Best hack I've come up with in 12 years of using this editor. Here it is:
  
Install the absolutely excellent vterm package:https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm
 Create the following script, put it somewhere reasonable:#!/bin/bashemacsclient -e "(progn (vterm) (vterm-send-string \"$*\") (vterm-send-return))"
 Install ob-tmux and configure:https://github.com/ahendriksen/ob-tmux(setq org-babel-tmux-terminal "<PATH TO THE BASH SCRIPT ABOVE>")(setq org-babel-tmux-terminal-opts nil)
 Enjoy!
 (e.t.a: with (setq vterm-enable-manipulate-selection-data-by-osc52 t) you also get integration between tmux visual mode and the kill-ring, which depending on your habits may be a more ergonomic way to copy/paste between terminal and emacs)

 As part of a project at university, I'm looking to formalize and implement a small DSL for proving statements in first-order logic based on Fitch notation. I'm going to implement this in Haskell.
 The implementation itself would not be a huge problem if I were to go by intuition alone, seeing as natural deduction in first-order logic is quite simple. However, since this is a project for university, I wanted to ask if you guys can recommend some interesting papers on various techniques and approaches (e.g. dependent type theory) that might be of use to me?
 Thanks!

 Currently, I have M-Backspace mapped to backward-kill-word be default, but I do not want to get used to that one because I use C-Backspace outside of Emacs. What is the best solution here? I have looked online and did not find solutions that work exactly like I want. Some remapped C-h which is not what I want to do.
 I am using wsl 2 ubuntu if that matters at all.

 I have environmental variable CFG and usually to use it i do smng like this:
 (use-package fixed-pitch :demand t :load-path (lambda () (substitute-in-file-name "${CFG}/Emacs/fixed-pitch/")) ... ) 
 But i can't make it work with yasnippet, instructions are:
 (setq yas-snippet-dirs '("~/.emacs.d/snippets" ;; personal snippets "/path/to/some/collection/" ;; foo-mode and bar-mode snippet collection "/path/to/yasnippet/yasmate/snippets" ;; the yasmate collection )) 
 And i tried lots of things (commented out):
 (use-package yasnippet :ensure t :config (setq yas-snippet-dirs '(;; (substitute-in-file-name "${CFG}/Emacs/snippets/") ;; (lambda () (substitute-in-file-name "${CFG}/Emacs/snippets/")) ;; (concat (getenv "CFG") "/Emacs/snippets/") ;; (lambda () (concat (getenv "CFG") "/Emacs/snippets/")) "~/snippets/" ) ) (setq yas-indent-line 'fixed) (yas-global-mode 1) ) 
 What's the right way to do it?

 For some reason, persp-mode isn’t loaded on initialization. What’s more interesting is it doesn’t load if I run persp-mode after Emacs is loaded, I have to execute persp-mode two times for it to work properly. Working properly for me means that C-c w prefix works.
 Any idea what I’m doing wrong?

 ​
 Suppose I have the following JSON:
 ​
 { "type": "some.type", "someObject": { "iExistBecause": "type=some.type", "somethingElse": 420 }, "moreFieldsAlwaysKnown": ... } 
 "type" can have a lot of values and in essence decides what "someObject" will be. I will omit moreFieldsAlwaysKnown for brevity. 
 I like typesafety so I naively thought I would encode this statically to make it users of my lib very difficult to create invalid values and track everything on the typelevel. In essence: 
 import qualified My.Module.Containing.SomeObject as SO -- Every "type" that can be transmitted over the wire. data MyType = SomeType | SomeOtherType | SomeMoreType -- Typeclass allowing to go from type -> value level. Serving…]]></summary>

 I’m trying to pick a language for a project I’m working on. Think of something like distributed redis with more persistent data structures and a schema. If you had to pick, would you build something like this with Haskell or would you stick with something like Rust or C++? Especially considering the query language for the database is more functional (term level haskell-like).

 I have already installed Scala.
 I am having difficulty in the initial setup, many guides are confusing and unclear.
 What should I do to start a scale project?
 What should I do to make spark work and therefore also "import org.apache.spark.SparkContext"?
 I would like to use the VisualStudio code.
 Can you suggest a procedure to follow or a clear guide?

 class DoerOffStuff { doIt(typeArg) { (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5) => { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, typeArg, arg3, arg4,arg5) } } val doItThisWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_A) val doItThatWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_B) val doItAnotherWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_C) } 
 I want to avoid having to type the argument list in the class definition, so I wanted to stick with val instead.
 Is there a way I can do that?
 I tried
 class DoerOffStuff { doIt(typeArg) { (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user) => { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, typeArg, arg3, arg4,arg5) } } val doItThisWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_A) val doItThatWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_B) val doItAnotherWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_C) } 
 but the the type checker will say "could not find implicit value for parameter user" for all places of ... = doIt(...)

 I have several common workflows which involve switching between buffers for files (that is, switching between buffers if the relevant file is already visited, or opening a new buffer visiting the file if not). There are generally two or three buffers or files in each group. I don't particularly need any new workflow tools for switching between groups, just between files within a group. What's important though is that these workflows are about switching between different types of file -- it would be very cumbersome to add all of the different pairs manually.

 Hi guys. I know this must be possible. But can you give me some examples in Haskell? Something like representing naturals and booleans with types, writing plus and if/else for them, etc.
 ​
 BTW, is Haskell's type inference engine Turing complete? I guess the answer is no. But why? Does UndecidableInstances have anything to do with this?
 ​
 Obviously, this question doesn't have a lot of practical value. It's a rabbit hole. Sorry for that. I'm just interested. And would be glad to hear from FP experts in our Reddit giving me some hints.

 Thanks all for your informative replies! I have had a busy day. Read your comments tomorrow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to write a website using yesod. The server needs some css and js files that I can include with juliusFile and luciusFile from the shakespeare library. If I add the files to extra-source-files in my cabal file the modules that need them even get automatically rebuild, when I change one of them.
 But I don’t want to write plain javascript or css. I‘d much rather write sass or typescript. So I need to compile those files so js or css if their source changes.
 Right now I use a custom build script with a custom buildHook that extracts the extra-source-files from the cabal file and builds them according to some build rules written in shake.
 How are bigger projects accomplishing this? Are they just using a makefile. Are they dropping cabal alltogether and only use shake? I know thats what GHC is doing, with their hadrian build system.
 I would love to hear of your experiences with different approaches! And yes I am procrastinating writing the thing I want to write really hard right now.

 If I'm editing a buffer with the following Python code

 It's not that big of a deal, but it would be nice to get rid of it.

It's not the first time I've heard people be dismissive of long time Emacs/Vim users. My last personal experience was someone telling me flat out I was wasting company time playing around with Emacs rather than using Pycharm.
 I have also gotten into long arguments that devolve into "feature-offs" where I have to explain how a feature VSCode has is also in Emacs. I tried to explain that you can use GDB in Emacs, and someone literally laughed at me because GDB is "ancient" and VSCode's debugging is modern and actually gets stuff done. It seems like even if Emacs can do something it's also A. Not good enough B. Takes too long to configure instead of just getting the job done.
 So please give me some advice on how I should combat this encroachment on my peaceful Emacs pasture. Or should I just give up my goats and switch to VSCode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 Im having a lot of fun taking my university (electronic engineering) notes in org-mode, using org-fragtog to toggle org-latex-preview and see math equations take life in real time.
 I'd really like to do the same thing with circuits, so I'm trying to use these tikz and circuitikz packages that let you draw circuits in latex.
 It compiles just fine, in fact when I export to pdf (SPC-m-e-l-o) the drawings are there.
 org-latex-preview also seem to try, very hard the first times I go over something, so my best guess is it's actually compiling and actually thinking it's showing it regularly, but no it doesn't. 
 Has someone had any similar experience? or any idea on how to move forward? 
 Thank you guys

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[im trying to convert given formula to an equivalent form, for negation and disjunctive normal form. i feel like i am at a good point but i have a lesser understanding of data types and structures in haskell that are limiting.
 here is how i defined the data type
 data Form = Var String | C Bool | Not Form | For :/\: Form | Form :\/: Form deriving (Eq, Show) 
 and then negation normal form
 nnf :: Form -> Form nnf (Var p) = Var p nnf (C p) = C p nnf (Not (Not p)) = nnf p nnf (p :/\: q) = nnf p :/\: nnf q nnf (p :\/: q) = nnf p :\/: nnf q nnf (Not (p :/\: q)) = (Not p) :\/: (Not q) nnf (Not (p :\/: q)) = (Not p) :/\: (Not q) nnf (Not p) = Not $ nnf p 
 and disjunctive normal form
 dnf :: Form -> Form dnf (Var s) = ((Var s)) dnf (p :\/: q) = (dnf p) :/\: (dnf q) dnf (p :/\: q) = undefined dnf (Not (Not p)) = dnf p dnf (Not (p :/\: q)) = (dnf $ Not p) :/\: (dnf $ Not q) dnf (Not (p :\/: q)) = undefined dnf (Not (Var s)) = Not (Var s) 
 i am struggling to get my dnf function to work properly or finding a correct approach. ive been using the nnf as reference for myself but any help/ suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Don’t worry (about writing Haskell), be happy (writing Agda instead)! by Jesper Cockx
As we all know, static type systems are great to ensure correctness of our programs. Sadly, in industry many people are forced to work in languages with a weak type system, such as Haskell.
Haskell and Visual Studio by Monday Morning Haskell

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was inspired by a question at the end of the Being lazy without being bloated presentation about the library nothunks, which asked if it was possible to do the same check statically.
 I managed to come up with a type class IsStrict which will give a type error if there is a non-strict field anywhere, at any depth, in the data structure given, explaining where the non-strict field is.
 Here it is in a gist: https://gist.github.com/anka-213/440cfef8c8712f5df747029640cfe170
 For example, if one were to ask if String is strict, it would give this error:  Found lazy field of type Char • In constructor: : • In type: [Char] • When checking strictness of: String Found lazy field of type [Char] • In constructor: : • In type: [Char] • When checking strictness of: String 
 It still works if we put the string inside some other data type, e.g. a strict pair ``` data StrictPair a b = P !a !b deriving Generic
 -- Non-strict type in strict field -- >>> nfStrict @(StrictPair Int String) -- Found lazy field of type Char -- • In constructor: : -- • In type: [Char] -- • In strict field of type [Char] -- • In constructor: P -- • In type: StrictPair Int String -- • When checking strictness of: StrictPair Int String -- ... ```
 This is of course more strict than checking nothunks, since you might have forced the data in some other way, so the data is thunk-free without having the data type be fully strict.

 I'm using a clean Emacs (v. 26) and have installed slime on it.
 I've got the following hello.cl and init.el
 https://gist.github.com/LucyJohnson-lua4life/e8c97bf931b7fd5795f5b9b22739c19d.
 I started "slime" and executed "slime-compile-and-load-file" on hello.cl, then i moved my cursor to the "some-function" symbol and executed "slime-who-calls". By now I would expect slime to show me the 3 other lines where "some-function" was executed but instead i got "No references found for some-function".
 Can somebody explain me how to fix this, or how to debug that?

By mistake I pressed a key that i shouldn't( I don't remember which one) and the file was moved somewhere but I cannot find where. I used find, and locate but nothing. I don't have a trash can folder on my system so its rather impossible to have moved it there by mistake. 
 Does emacs, or dired provide any sort of "history of moved files" or something similar that will help me find the file?

 the only thing i miss is being able to see the code actions available in the modeline and the project error list from flymake (not just the current buffer) in the modeline.
 It would be nice if there was a way to go to the previous/next error in project.
 anyone would know how to do that?
 flymake-show-project-diagnostics with eglot is so much better than lsp-treemacs tho, i love it just for that...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having recently been bitten by an unexpected failed Future, I was wondering if there is anything like a "safe" wrapper for Futures. Basically, the goal is to make concurrent API's inside an application not to have the hidden back-channel behaviour, yet still be composable in the usual way. A minimal implementation might be on the base Future to do a .transformWith(t => Future.successful(t.toEither)) and then return that or wrap in EitherT, maybe wrapping either of those result types.
 Would need to support stack-safe flatMap for Cats-effect. 
 Just speculating, thinking aloud here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I'm trying to wean myself off the actor model. I've grown used to thinking of systems as supervision trees. How to represent these trees without actors? E.g., let's imagine this tree structure is my app:
 - app: my app - scheduler: should wake up every quarter hour (0m, 15m, 30m, 45m) and perform a task - my_svc_pool: connection pool to a service that is called from within the scheduled task - my_svc: connection to my service - my_svc: another connection to my service 
 So let's say scheduler wakes up, tries to run its task by calling out to my_svc_pool, but the particular connection that it got routed to in the pool happened to get disconnected right before that. So the service call fails and scheduler blows up and goes away, leaving my app running without the 15-minute scheduled tasks that were supposed to happen.
 How would you structure an app with futures or tasks or any effect system (leaving aside actors) to supervise the system as a whole such that:
  
If a service connection in the connection pool happened to get disconnected and we just found out, my_svc_pool should safely dispose of it and replace it
 If scheduler blows up on waking up and trying to perform its task, app should replace it with a fresh one

In this post I will describe the approach that I’ve recently introduced in rules_haskell
to achieve clear, maintainable and efficient tests for Bazel rules.

Why even bother?
All software needs to be tested and verified, and Bazel rules are no exception. Some of them are
popular public libraries with a lot of projects depending on them, and they need a proper test set
to allow every contributor, frequent or occasional, to propose a change with little risk of breaking the
public API those rules represents. The same applies to the rules that live in huge monorepos growing every day,
where they often act as a glue between different components and can become complex, tricky and fragile.
Also every Bazel rule introduces…]]></summary>

 How can I do this with ZIO? I tried memoize, but, if I map over the task 2 times within a for, it is "cached", but if I call getFruits() 2 times from a zio-http api, well, it goes to the DB again.
 So I have something like this
 DAO:
 case class QueryService(quill: Quill.Cassandra[Literal]) { val fruits: Quoted[EntityQuery[Fruit]] = quote { querySchema[Fruit]("fruits") } } object QueryService { val live: URLayer[Quill.Cassandra[Literal], QueryService] = ZLayer.fromFunction(QueryService(_)) } case class FruitsDao(queryService: QueryService) { def allFruits: Task[Seq[Fruit]] = run( queryService.fruits ) } object FruitsDao { val live: ZLayer[QueryService, Nothing, FruitsDao] = ZLayer.fromFunction(FruitsDao(_)) } 
 service:
  val fruits: Task[Seq[Fruit] = dao.allFruits def getFruits(): Task[Seq[Fruit]] = { val res = for { f <- fruits //f2 <- fruits // memoize would only help here } yield doSomethingWithFruits(fruits) 
 and this is called from zio-http

 When I insert a new line in my Java file, I get a lovely, sexy tab for indentation inserted automatically.
 When I press the backspace key to delete the tab, all my tabs are changed into spaces. This disgusts me. It angers me. I am close to homicidal.
 Does anyone know how to stop this?
 I have tried running "indent-tabs-mode t", but that does nothing, which makes sense, because tabs are already enabled.
 The functionality I want is simple. Tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment. When I delete a tab, it deletes the tab. When I delete a space, it deletes the space.
 I've been googling for quite a while, and can't seem to figure it out.

 I'm creating a wrapper around a pre-compiled C library (GLFW, I know bindings exist, it's for figuring out how to use the Haskell FFI in a practical setting), and I haven't been able to figure out how to get stack to include the C headers in the build. 
 This means that my build works, but I get a number of warnings about implicit function declarations during compilation. e.g.:
 C:\Users\****\AppData\Local\Temp\ghc23648_0\ghc_5.c:8:61: error: warning: implicit declaration of function 'glfwInit' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration] 8 | HsInt32 ghczuwrapperZC1ZCmainZCMainZCglfwInit(void) {return glfwInit();} [...] 8 | HsInt32 ghczuwrapperZC1ZCmainZCMainZCglfwInit(void) {return glfwInit();} 
 I figured out how to add C libraries in package.yaml with extra-lib-dirs: and extra-libraries:. Unfortunately, when I browse the internet, the field it suggests for adding headers in Cabal, includes:, doesn't actually get recognized by Stack:
 C:\Users\****\Workspace\Testing\ffitest\package.yaml: Ignoring unrecognized field $.executables.ffitest-exe.includes 
 Just to be sure, I tried to use the same field in stack.yaml instead, just in case it would be recognized there. It causes the same error.
 What is the appropriate way to include C header files in a Stack project, assuming there is one?

 Hi everyone,
 Today I finally decided to not just watch videos about Haskell but giving it a quick try to see how it works and feels.
 Since I just wanted to get a feel, I didn't want to start installing everything (especially because it was more than one step like downloading one file and installing it, lazy here) so I just went for the many Haskell browser consoles (replit for example) and I just couldn't do anything that I see in the many YouTube tutorials because of this "main =" thingy. I then tried with a "main = do" and writing under it but nothing works as in the tutorial, example "sumOfNums = [1..1000]" among many others.
 What can I do if I want to just play around, test basic functions etc in a browser ? It seems that I am supposed to already know some level of coding architecture and in every basic tutorial I watched there isn't any mention of such main = ...
 It's puzzling me how incredibly complicated this simple beginner step seems to be when comparing to, say, groovy web console, in which you can just type things, functions, classes etc...
 Thanks guys !

 Is there any way to list the nearest header above a TODO item in agenda view, in addition to the file name? I’m thinking of those cases where a file may have several projects broken out under different headers like this:
 File name: ProjectFile.org * Project 1 ** TODO 1 * Project 2 ** TODO 1
 It’d be great if agenda showed:
 ProjectFile:Project 1:TODO 1 ProjectFile:Project 2:TODO 1
 Instead of just:
 ProjectFile:TODO 1 ProjectFile:TODO 1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The transient package has a macro transient-define-prefix (docs). The following defines a complete prefix:
 (setq l1 '(("vl" "visual lines" visual-line-mode))) (transient-define-prefix foo1 () "docstring" [:pad-keys t ["Appearance" l1]]) 
 (The macro allows for a list of "elements" like l1 to be interpolated, something like a ,@ splice in a backtick context.)
 But having the variable l1 lying around feels like a loose end. The following approach looks better:
 (let ((l2 '(("vl" "visual lines" visual-line-mode)))) (transient-define-prefix foo2 () "docstring" [:pad-keys t ["Appearance" l2]])) 
 But it fails with "Symbol’s value as variable is void: l2"
 My understanding of elisp scope is clearly lacking.
 Is the problem that the transient-define-prefix macro is expanded within the let scope but the result is not evaluated until after the let scope is discarded? The elisp documentation for macros says that "[t]he Lisp interpreter proceeds to evaluate the expansion as soon as it comes back from the macro" but I may be misunderstanding this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to implement the following function, for working with cyclical musical scales:
 cyclicIndex :: [a] -> Int -> a -- cyclicIndex is total in its second argument -- provided its first argument is total and not infinite cyclicIndex xs i = xs !! (i mod N) where N = length xs i mod N = unique representative of NZ+i in [0..N) 
 My attempt is
 cyclicIndex :: [a] -> Int -> a cyclicIndex xs i = if i >= 0 then (cycle xs) !! i else (cycle (reverse xs)) !! (-1-i) 
 This seems to work, and the function is a simple enough function, but I am having trouble reasoning about its correctness from my specification. My attempts at calculating its correctness runs into confusion about mod in Haskell and mod in maths. In particular, I noted down the laws
  
cycle xs !! i = xs !! (mod n i) for i >= 0 (note the mod is Haskell's mod)
 reverse xs !! i = xs !! (N - 1 - i) for i in [0..N)
 cycle . reverse = reverse . cycle? (A free theorem? Useful?)
  
How might we approach this correctness problem?

 I want to run emacs inside a development container (as I'm using Fedora Silverblue), but I'm having a weird issue:
 My config files are all in ~/.config/emacs/, but just after the launch of the container (distrobox-enter), emacs creates ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d and ignores the config folder.
 If I stop emacs, delete ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d and restart emacs, my init.el in ~/.config/emacs/ is considered and emacs starts configured the proper way.
 For now I think I will just move my config folder, but if you think this is an issue I might need to report on the mailing list, or if you can help me investigate a bit more, feel free to help me!

 So. 1) Does the concept of PATH exist on Windows? \ 1.1) Can the PATH be changed to include something either from mingw or Debian subsystem?
 Looks like starting up the subsystem takes some time, so I'm also worried about performance. \ 2) Should I be going about this in another way entirely?

I was having a conversation one day and I couldn’t recall the name of a term, something I learned from a YouTube video. That bothered me. After the chat I went back to YouTube, found the video, and started searching through it. I increased the playback speed and went back and forth but still couldn’t find it. After a few minutes of that struggle, I thought: “what the heck am I doing?”. Then I wrote a tiny elisp function to extract subtitles. While reading through the subs I realized how much good stuff went past my ears (while watching the video).
  
It's tiny and very simple, but I think can be used already.

Although this is enough to do basic editing, I would like to learn emacs "the emacs way", as I'm not a vimmer. I'm just using doom emacs as a crutch while I get comfortable with emacs and lisp.
 ​
 Anyway, I've tried the following:
 comment out (evil +everywhere) with two semi colons in "~/.doom.d/init.el"
 ran doom sync
 added (package! evil-mode :disable t) to "packages.el"
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 deleted (evil +everywhere) from "init.el" completely
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 removed +bindings from :config default in "init.el"
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 ​
 I'm not sure what else I should try.
 ​
 EDIT: rebooted my machine and evil is no more. Not sure at which point I could/should have rebooted but here we are.

 In vim, I currently have it set up so that when a line soft wraps, it will be indented by one tab width compared to the first line, as seen here: https://imgur.com/X6GTuaL
 In emacs, I have visual-line-mode and org-indent-mode enabled, which makes the soft wrapped lines flush with the first line (seen here: https://imgur.com/4xfBZnJ). I searched through google and any settings I could think of, but cannot find a way to indent the wrapped lines in emacs the same was as it is in vim.
 Is there a setting I'm missing, or a package that will do this for me? If not, is this something that could be done in lisp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've encountered a design issue several times, and I'm wondering what approach is most consistent with Haskell idioms/best practices.
 I'm implementing a data structure, call it Z a, with an interface for manipulating it where almost all of the functions in the interface return a Z a, with many of the form Z a -> Z a or b -> Z a -> Z a. But for a few of the functions there's no valid result for some edge case inputs, and it makes sense in those situations to return Maybe (Z a). 
 Now at that point, it makes sense to have every function in the interface return Maybe (Z a) because I can then sequence my operations nicely with >>= 
 z :: Z a z >>= op1 >>= op2 >>= (op3 x) >>= (op4 1 2) 
 or something like
 pipe :: (Foldable t, Monad m) => a -> t (a -> m a) -> m a pipe = foldM (&) z :: Z a pipe z [op1, op2, op3 x, op4 1 2] 
 This is pretty convenient, I suppose, but then just one or two operations that have a Maybe result changed the entire interface to the data structure. An alternative would be to make the data structure itself an instance of Monad and make everything again -> Z a. There are several advantages of internalizing, e.g., I can carry some extra information in the Nothing case or even have several failure paths; and several disadvantages -- the non maybe'd functions now have to do the boilerplate to check for the Nothing-ish inputs and pass them along for every function, whereas Maybe does that automatically.
 My question is what are the Haskell best practices/idioms for this decision. Where is the boundary for the choice between internalizing the Monad instance in the data structure type itself and just using something like Maybe for *all* the functions in the interface. 
 I hope my question is clear. Thanks for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Lately, I've been defining my own regular expressions for parsing errors in the *compilation* buffers by adding entries to the compilation-error-regexp-alist and compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variables. However, there's a problem. This list already contains an enormous amount of regular expressions for all kinds of languages that I don't use, however, these regular expressions also match errors of the language that I'm trying to add support to, and this results in extracting incorrect paths to files containing errors. I've set compilation-error-regexp-alist to nil and the problem disappeared, but now when I byte-compile elisp files, I get no way to jump to problems from the compilation buffer (well, duh, the regexp list now doesn't contain an entry for elisp).
 So this creates a problem. I want my regular expressions to be the only ones present in the list when I'm working on a project in this language, and I want other regexps to be available when I'm working on other projects. I've thought about using dir-locals.el but my regexps use functions to get the file out of the error message, and I can't put that into dir-locals reliably.
 Another problem is that the compilation-error-regexp-alist contains names of the languages it supports, but for example, there's no elisp or emacs-lisp entry, yet the byte-compile warnings are highlighted correctly. And there's no way to see what regular expressions are responsible for the matches in the compilation buffer, so it's hard to debug what's overriding mine.
 TL;DR: Ideally, I want compilation-error-regexp-alist to be configurable per project but I use custom functions that can break other people's configurations who work on the same project as me and load dir-locals.el

 When using org capture templates with expansion variables I often find it's confusing because you don't know what information you're being promoted to insert.
 For instance, if asked to a URL and then a description, all you see in the minibuffer is "clipboard/kill value:" repeatedly.
 Is there a way to customise that prompt? Or maybe have placeholders with useful names in the template that get overwritten?

 Does anyone have a hack that does this? I know that the project is essentially unmaintained at this point, but hopefully there's someone in the community who knows. I think it would involve using the Conversation ID in the new API and using something like the existing twittering-get-replied-statuses function.

 Here's the problem. I'm trying to find definitions for a struct, but eglot can't find it.
 ​
 file.cpp has a function
 function (struct type_t *t1, ...) {
 type_t *temp = t1; // this line here
 }
 ​
 When I do xref-find-definition for type_t, it simply shows me the "struct type_t *t1" in the file above.
 type_t is defined in another header, which this file includes. Why can't eglot/xref jump to the definition in the file that defines type_t? lsp-mode, there's no issue at all. (I am compiling my code with bear to get a compile_commands.json file).
 ​
 What am I missing?

 It would take quite a bit of time (we are talking 0.3s but enough to be annoying) to exit the normal mode when inside a tmux session. It would then do some crazy things too between those 0.3s if I start typing some letters...
 I discovered this spacemacs issue and buried in the comments this tmux setting : 
 set -s escape-time 0 
 which works exactly as intended and give you an exit to normal mode straight away...
 so if anyone else has this issue and find this post then I guess you are welcome internet stranger :)

 Does it have anything similar for reading E-mail?
 Most modes that I know of are part of another package (like Gnus or Wanderlust or Mew, etc.) but lets imagine I've fetched my E-mail via some other means; home-grown, if you will.
 I, now, want to read them but I don't want to roll my own mode to do so; repurposing another package's for this purpose would probably likewise be fine so long as it could be isolated from the rest of the package (e.g. mh-show? But we'd want to avoid accidentally triggering mh-rmail while using mh-show, for example).
 I can't seem to find a Mail mode equivalent but for reading mail, instead of sending.

 Then I do C-c C-c and it openes only the 1st file from the list 00.cookbook.pl, then it recovers it from #00.cookbook.pl# and stops recovering session. It doesn't open neither the 00.lwp.proxy.pl, nor the older session file, that was previously open.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a little problem with AUCTeX indentation. I am looking for some kind of settings that would "simplify" the indentation, if that makes any sense? Especially in math and tabular environments. Has someone come across anything like that?
 My reasons. Sometimes I need to move things around, align, or split to have a clearer structure. AUCTeX does not seem to respond well for that kind of manual writing and neglect all the work after hitting TAB or ENTER.
 I used to work with Atom, in which idea about indentation was very simple: when I decided to move cursor two extra tabs to the right, all following lines would hold on that indentation until I'd changed it. This helped me to structure long equations to see them better.
 I hope whatever I wrote make sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working through this blog post on building a simple interpreter, which uses the type Expr Value to describe an expression which evaluates to a value, and Expr (Value -> Value) to describe an expression which evaluates to a function. 
 Now, the type constructor Expr has kind *->* by default, which I think is too general. I see no situation when we would put anything other than functions involving Value into it, and I think it could count as a programmer error if there was a value Expr a, where a is not in F, where F ::= Value | F -> F.
 Questions:
  
Is there a way to enforce this constraint in Haskell, e.g. using type families?
 Is there a nice way to describe F in Haskell?
  
One additional challenge is that data Expr a = ClosedExpr a | OpenExpr Name (Expr (Value -> a)) has useful functor and applicative instances, which I hope can remain.

This will be the next paper I will process. It is highly relevant for the next material for the Zettelkasten Method. Right now, I am processing the application to physics which is also a nice read.
To me, the key learning for the Zettelkasten Method is the heavy emphasis on decision making. I can't express it precise enough to communicate it nicely. But there is a striking similarity to learning the Zettelkasten Method. Right now, many people try to learn it as if they learn something from a textbook. It feels rather "formulaic". But it is important to get a feel for the implicit decisions you make through your actions. Yes, there are principles and good practices. But they will not serve you well if you are not aware of there rational.]]></summary>

Specifically, the pain points with TRAMP shows up mostly in dired and magit, where the turnaround speed (time spent to open a folder in dired, or time spend in any magit command) is quite high. I suspect this is due to the underlying process that TRAMP uses to connect to my remote server. My remote connection is relatively fast (100Mbps+). Things that I have tried till now are:
  
For my remote server, set the following flags in .ssh/config such that TRAMP re-uses the connections
  
 Host myfasthost ... Compression yes ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p ControlMaster auto ControlPersist 90m 
  
I use scp protocol to connect to TRAMP in dired. For example, to open a remote folder /path/to/my/folder, I use the following:
  
 /scp:myfasthost:/path/to/my/folder 
 Is there any other protocols I can use to ensure faster connections? Or any other tips/hacks to improve the TRAMP dired+magit experience? TIA!

 I am about to start a new project in Haskell, model checking with (new) tree-like data structures. I think it is best to start building on a library such that i can already have elegant base functions, yet i am wondering what library is currently the standard? I read about fgl ( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl ), yet it is a very old library. 
 It is a proof-of-concept project, thus i would like to do this in Haskell (clean mathematical code + modularity) instead of a lower level language (C++, C).
 In my project i will need: 
  
memoization (during a recursive depth-first traversal)
 
labelled edges
 
nodes have values corresponding to a ordinal indicating their level.
 
some special nodes which transform my traversal function's interpretation.
 
labelled leaf nodes
 
 Any recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After trying to refresh my email setup, I ended up mistakenly (i.e. deliberately, but without considering the consequence) updating mu and mu4e. I was on version 1.5.5, and I've ended up on 1.8.9.
 This upgrade does seem to break a lot of my little tweaks to mu4e. I've managed to sort a few of these out, e.g. mu4e~proc-remove-id becomes mu4e--server-remove-id, mu4e~mark-check-target becomes mu4e--mark-check-target .
 But there are still a few bugs. I previously stole a function to convert an email to a .pdf file:
 (defun mu4e-action-open-to-pdf (msg) (let* ((date (mu4e-message-field msg :date)) (infile (mu4e~write-body-to-html msg)) (outfile (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d%H%M%S.pdf" date))) (with-temp-buffer (shell-command (format "wkhtmltopdf %s ~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s" infile outfile) t)) (interactive) (find-file (format "~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s" outfile) ) )) 
 Now mu4e~write-body-html is no longer defined.
 My questions are:
  
Is there a replacement for mu4e~write-body-html? Or a different method to convert a message to pdf?
 
I've tried to follow the release notes here, but find it hard to follow... for instance, the releases jump from 1.4.15 to 1.6.0? (So where is 1.5.5?) Is there a compilation of all these changes from e.g. ~ to -- and other general refactoring?
 
 EDIT:
 Just found this warning in the documentation:
 The whole of mu4e consists of hundreds of elisp functions. However, the majority of those are for internal use only; you can recognize them easily, because they all start with mu4e~ or mu4e--. These functions make all kinds of assumptions, and they are subject to change, and should therefore not be used. 
 which explains the instability. Didn't see this/know enough about elisp when I stole the functions. Fair enough.

Undoubtedly the worst binding I’ve had to deal with is C-x on emacs. I took the suggestion from the emacswiki and swapped C-u and C-x. I barely use C-u anyway, and this places C-x right under the pointer in the home row, which is very comfortable. Common sequences like C-x C-s and C-x C-e become optimal homerow rolls.
  
I was wondering how to do that natively in emacs without using karabiner/xmodmap or other OS dependent solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announcing the posit-3.2 library, where Real numbers are approximated by Maybe Rational. The Posit type is mapped to a 2's complement integer type; smoothly and with tapering precision, in a similar way to the projective real line.
 The implementation includes word sizes from 8 to 256 bits.
 The library is implemented with several Haskell Language extensions:
 {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} -- For our main type Posit (es :: ES) {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} -- For our ES kind and the constructors Z, I, II, III, IV, V for exponent size type {-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-} -- For defining the type of kind ES that indexes the GADT {-# LANGUAGE ViewPatterns #-} -- To decode the posit in the pattern {-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-} -- Added Strictness for some fixed point algorithms {-# LANGUAGE PatternSynonyms #-} -- for a nice NaR interface {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} -- To make instances for each specific type from Posit8 to Posit256 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-} -- Allow non-type variables in the constraints {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-} -- To apply types: with '@', it seems to select the specific class instance {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} -- To convert between Posit Types {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} -- To reduce some code duplication {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-} -- To reduce some code duplication, I think the code is decidable but GHC is not smart enough ;) 
 The one area that I think Haskell or my understanding of Haskell can improve is with some code duplication in the internal 'PositC' class. It would be neat to be able to make default implementations of class functions that are polymorphic over an associated type.
 Enjoy!

Im currently using emacs 29.0.50 (commit 72c64dd73c), and so M-<down> and M-<up> can cycle through the completions (directories in this case with the cd command), while keeping the eshell buffer focused. The problem I'm facing now is how to actually insert the currently highlighted completion into my eshell buffer. Clicking on the completion with the mouse will insert it into eshell, as well as switching focus to the *Completions* buffer and hitting RET over it, but I'm trying to do this without having to switch focus from eshell. M-<up> and M-<down>, added new in emacs 29, allow cycling through completions while keeping focus in the current window (my eshell in this case), but I cant select one. The command minibuffer-choose-completion, which is bound to M-RET returns an error saying "Text is read only", which I think is happening because it is trying to insert the completion into the minibuffer and not my eshell window. Moreover, completion-at-point for symbols in elisp files works as intended with M-RET, but not for eshell. Any help on how to sort this would be great. Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running the following R code in a code block in org-mode.
 #+begin_src R :session :results output latex :exports results library(ggplot2) library(xtable) x <- rnorm(1000) g0 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(x), aes(x)) + geom_histogram(); g0 hist_dat <- ggplot_build(g0)$data[[1]] hist_dat <- hist_dat |> select(xmin, xmax, count) print(xtable(hist_dat, digits = c(0, 1, 1, 0)), include.rownames = FALSE) #+end_src 
 This creates the expected LaTeX code:
 \begin{table}[ht] \centering \begin{tabular}{rrr} \hline xmin & xmax & count \\ \hline -3.3 & -3.1 & 1 \\ -3.1 & -2.9 & 1 \\ -2.9 & -2.6 & 0 \\ -2.6 & -2.4 & 5 \\ -2.4 & -2.2 & 7 \\ -2.2 & -1.9 & 14 \\ -1.9 & -1.7 & 11 \\ -1.7 & -1.5 & 20 \\ -1.5 & -1.3 & 35 \\ -1.3 & -1.0 & 49 \\ -1.0 & -0.8 & 64 \\ -0.8 & -0.6 & 67 \\ -0.6 & -0.3 & 108 \\ -0.3 & -0.1 & 90 \\ -0.1 & 0.1 & 98 \\ 0.1 & 0.3 & 85 \\ 0.3 & 0.6 & 84 \\ 0.6 & 0.8 & 62 \\ 0.8 & 1.0 & 59 \\ 1.0 & 1.3 & 35 \\ 1.3 & 1.5 & 32 \\ 1.5 & 1.7 & 22 \\ 1.7 & 1.9 & 25 \\ 1.9 & 2.2 & 13 \\ 2.2 & 2.4 & 10 \\ 2.4 & 2.6 & 1 \\ 2.6 & 2.9 & 1 \\ 2.9 & 3.1 & 0 \\ 3.1 & 3.3 & 0 \\ 3.3 & 3.6 & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular} \end{table} 
 However, when I run org-export-dispatch and select export to LaTeX and As PDF file and open, I get nothing in the PDF (neither code nor the results). I wonder what I'm doing wrong.

 I've been using orderless with some custom dispatchers for a while now, but I've always felt like something was wrong or too complex when using the OR operator (regex: \(pattern1\|pattern2\)).
 So today I invested half a hour into learn basics of Elisp string operations and have created my own dispatcher for that.
 (defun or-regexp (pattern index _total) (cond ((string-suffix-p "|" pattern) `(orderless-regexp . ,(concat "\\(" (concat (s-replace "|" "\\|" (substring pattern 0 -1)) "\\)")))) ((string-match-p "|" pattern) `(orderless-regexp . ,(concat "\\(" (concat (s-replace "|" "\\|" pattern) "\\)")))))) 
 I assume it's not the prettiest code, but it's enough for me

Wright Mills talks about his methods for note taking, thinking, and analysis in what he calls "sociological imagination". This is a sociologists' framing of their own research and analysis practice and thus bears a sociological related name. While he talks more about the thinking, outlining, and writing process rather than the mechanical portion of how he takes notes or what he uses, he's extending significantly on the ideas and methods that Sönke Ahrens describes in How to Take Smart Notes (2017), though obviously he's doing it 65 years earlier.

 Now I'd like to pre-compile all the eln files ahead of time, so emacs does not compile the files every time the container spins up again.

 I have set EMACSNATIVELOADPATH which seems to avoid that doom generates eln files in the tmp directory.
 I have set

 57,655|45,049|45,363 
 Or as
 (57,655)|(45,049)|(45,363) 
 (basically ignore everything except digits and "," and separate elements with "|")
 As i understand i need to create 2 custom paste functions (one regular, one with "()"s) taking original paste function as basis. I found the pasting function (via c-h k):
 (defun cua-paste (arg) "Paste last cut or copied region or rectangle. An active region is deleted before executing the command. With numeric prefix arg, paste from register 0-9 instead. If global mark is active, copy from register or one character." (interactive "P") (setq arg (cua--prefix-arg arg)) (let ((regtxt (and cua--register (get-register cua--register))) (count (prefix-numeric-value arg))) (cond ((and cua--register (not regtxt)) (message "Nothing in register %c" cua--register)) (cua--global-mark-active (if regtxt (cua--insert-at-global-mark regtxt) (when (not (eobp)) (cua--insert-at-global-mark (filter-buffer-substring (point) (+ (point) count))) (forward-char count)))) (buffer-read-only (error "Cannot paste into a read-only buffer")) (t (cond (regtxt (cond ;; This being a cons implies cua-rect is loaded? ((consp regtxt) (cua--insert-rectangle regtxt)) ((stringp regtxt) (insert-for-yank regtxt)) (t (message "Unknown data in register %c" cua--register)))) ((memq this-original-command '(clipboard-yank x-clipboard-yank)) (funcall this-original-command)) (t (yank arg))))))) 
 and as i understand i need to modify "arg" before doing "yank arg", but i have not idea how this "modification" should look like :) Could someone please help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[… would it be possible to implement it?
 I’m thinking of the lambda calculus as purely functional language with only anonymous functions. We could introduce recursion with the Y-combinator (λf. (λx. f (x x)) (λx. f (x x)). In the Haskell idiom it would be: (\f -> (\x -> f (x x)) (\x -> f (x x)) which will give us an error because of Haskell’s type system. 
  • Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: t0 ~ t0 -> t • In the first argument of ‘x2’, namely ‘x2’ In the first argument of ‘f’, namely ‘(x2 x2)’ In the expression: f (x2 x2) • Relevant bindings include x2 :: t0 -> t (bound at <interactive>:19:40) f :: t -> t (bound at <interactive>:19:12) y :: (t -> t) -> t (bound at <interactive>:19:5) 
 Is there any other way we could introduce recursion to Haskell if it wasn’t there already?

It demands the .so module requires recompilation at the drop of a hat. For some reason trying to run vterm after restarting Emacs requires it to be recompiled. It is as if the module itself is missing or Doom detects that some related source files have changed.
 
The vterm windows don't have modelines or titles around them and that makes it hard to tell them apart when they are split. Is there some way to set these?

 This year, I'm participating in Hacktoberfest as a mentor and maintainer. And I'm happy to offer my mentorship in the following two projects:
  
Haskell Beginners 2022 — a Haskell course for complete beginners. It doesn't require any prior FP knowledge at all! And it's format is perfectly suitable for Hacktoberfest. Read more information in how to participate instructions.
 Iris — a Haskell CLI framework I created earlier this year. It's still at the early stage. But it has tons of beginner-friendly issues! Check out issues with the "hacktoberfest" label.
  
Feel free to ask any questions!
 Also, please, don't hesitate to share your projects that participate in Hacktoberfest this year as well! 🤗

 Emacs usually opens the third window with a horizontal split, and I hate that. Say a daily note in org-roam. I would like to tell emacs there should always be two windows, opened side-by-side, not three, not one, no horizontal split. How do I do that?

 The library does not seem to specify how to do this / if it is possible, the library is found here:

 ​
 The readme does not specify this, but the Code itself seems fairly small, i tried understanding it (its hard for me to understand), it seems it mentions something about arguments input, and as specified by "man pdf2svg" i should be able to supply page number as argument so i tried doing:
 ```

 +NAME: fig:l1p2
 +ARGUMENTS: 2
 [[./01_Introduction.pdf]] ```
 with no luck, hopefully a clever guy here knows how i can do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello every one,
 I didn’t pay attention until recently, but I keep seeing the following warning while byte-compiling my preference files:
  Warning: ‘string-as-unibyte’ is an obsolete function (as of 26.1); use ‘encode-coding-string’. 
 I use the following code to convert arbitrary text (usually utf-8, but may be something else):
  (base64-encode-string (string-as-unibyte (buffer-string)) 'no-line-break) 
 I did look at the encode-coding-string, but what bother me is that it seems that I’m obliged to set the original coding-system. But in my case it can change from time to time.
 Is there a way to keep the same "magical" behavior of string-as-unibyte function, with which I didn’t have to assume a possibly wrong source coding system? Am I correct if I say it’d be the undecided coding system? As in:
  (base64-encode-string (encode-coding-string (buffer-string) 'undecided) 'no-line-break) 
 As I’m reading the whole buffer content, is there a (local) variable holding the current buffer coding system?
 Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, my company Mercury is hosting a Haskell meetup on October 20th, 2022 at 6 PM in downtown Portland. If you're interested in giving a talk, we have slots for 25 minute and 5 minute talks. Talks already planned include:
 ​
 Practical STM: An Async Job Queue, by Jake Keuhlen
 ​
  
In this talk, we’ll walk through a brief introduction to concurrency and one of Haskell’s best tools for dealing with it: software transactional memory (STM). We’ll then use STM to build a simple but powerful asynchronous job queue.
  
Make your own Haskell, by Mitchell Vitez
 ​
  
We'll explore the process of making our own Haskell-like language. Composition will lead us to trees, and trees will lead us to languages. We'll grow, trim, typecheck, and reorganize these trees, populating our own little forested enclave. Finally, we'll discover why our language can't really be represented by a tree after all.
  
​
 We'll have pizza delivered and the event will be bartended.
 The event is at the Power + Light Building, at 920 Southwest 6th Avenue.
 Please RSVP here if you're interested: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/haskell-talks-at-mercury-tickets-424633328717. Note: You must RSVP through Eventbrite for building security to let you in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been a Dynalist user for years, as my notes tend to follow a hierarchy, but I’m wanting to transition to org-mode for obvious reasons. When you search a page in Dynalist, you get search results in the context of each parent line ("parent" as determined by indentation level). The same goal is accomplished in ogrep.
 Is this type of search possible in emacs? In org-mode, I know there is sparse-tree, but it is not as "sparse" as ogrep or Dynalist, giving much more context than I sometimes need. This feature is so valuable to me that I'll have to craft a solution with your suggestions if one doesn’t yet exist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem with updating, upgrading and syncing Doom profiles is that you need to ensure that the ~/.doom.d and the path to bin/doom for the profiles do not conflict in your shell and I had to do some experimentation using ~/.emacs-profiles.el and ~/.doom.d/init.el to get this approach working.
 It is based on the idea that when managing your Doom installation with the doom sync, doom build etc commands you run the commands in vterm or term sessions from the same Chemacs2 session.
 You might consider this post an attempt to get others to find any bugs in my approach as I just got it working and the it works on my system caveat applies.
 Settings in ~/.emacs-profiles.el
  ("doom01" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/doom") (env . (("DOOMDIR" . "~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/config") ("DOOMPATH" . "~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/doom/bin") ("CHEMACS2PROFILE" . "doom01") )) )) 
 Command in $DOOMDIR/init.el
  (setenv "PATH" (concat (expand-file-name (getenv "DOOMPATH") "") ":" (getenv "PATH"))) 
 The setenv command in the Doom config's init.el sets the path to bin/doom in that profile and ~/.doom.d is automatically taken care of by DOOMDIR.
 With the $PATH variable including the path to the relevant bin\doom vterm and term inherit them automatically and the doom xxxx commands work as expected.
 The values in ~/.emacs-profiles.el and that command in init.el are the sole source of truth for mantaining that Doom installations. You don't need to set environment variables or paths anywhere else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Very long time emacs user here with a bunch of elisp under my belt - but this simple problem just eludes me.
 For years, I've done all my testing and running in a compile window.
 Emacs knows error messages that appear in that window, and I can use either M-x next-error to get to the error, or hit return on that line.
 This works pretty well flawlessly for me... but now I have a new tool and only a few of its errors get highlighted this way and I cannot see the difference!
 For example, in the run below, only the second error (fasteners.py) is highlighted and can be reached through next-error or carriage return: see https://imgur.com/a/I6P3egg
 -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: "/code/engora-search/" -*- Compilation started at Thu Sep 29 23:34:35 $ TERM=dumb d engora test --refurb engora/network/request/url_request.py:37:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/parser/fasteners.py:107:9 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/server/search.py:26:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/server/server.py:39:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` Run `refurb --explain ERR` to further explain an error. Use `--quiet` to silence this message 
 Why?
 My only theory was that fasteners.py:107:9 had three digits, the others two, but no: https://imgur.com/a/zgZ85M4 
 The output is already going through my own Python program, so I could easily rewrite it a bit without having to touch the refurb source - if I knew what was wrong.
  
Any ideas? This isn't a game blocker for me at all, but it's weirdly frustrating because I can't work it out. :-D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running Eglot or lsp-mode while working on remote files seems to be a common and rather problematic use-case, so I'm trying to understand why so many people need this.
 I have several projects where I can't or am not allowed to execute any code locally, and instead have a remote machine available for computations. But I've never encountered a project were I can't have the source code itself locally. So what I do is to edit the code locally and periodically sync it with the remote machine.
 The syncing part is admittedly a bit awkward, but there are ways to make it easier or mostly automatic. And then all Emacs features and external tools work fast and smoothly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's two problems I'm running into; the first was, as the title says, that all messages in my Inbox would get marked as ancient except, maybe, a few at the top.
 This would happen every time; if I wait a day (and, so, have new E-mails come in) and then open Gnus again for the first time? All new E-mails marked as ancient.
 And then, recently, the E-mails just stopped showing.
 I'd already edited the Group's parameters to include (visible . t) and turned off scoring. I tried gnus-summary-show-all-threads and gnus-summary-limit-include-dormant (nothing happened and I was informed there were no dormant articles, respectively); I tried C-u M-g (I actually think this is what's causing the previous messages to not show up anymore, other than any which are still marked as new in my Inbox).
 I just want to display all messages and for their status to reflect what's on the E-mail server; if it's new there, Gnus should show new, etc. I'm not using any offline storing or anything, just nnimap. Is there any easy way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-mode for taking notes, mostly math and physics these days, typing LaTeX equations inside org files. For this I use doom emacs.
 I've seen that with markup markers such as "*" (bold) and "/" (italics), org-hide-emphasis-markers allows for showing the effect in the text while getting rid of the cumbersome markers. Moreover, when the point is within markers, they show so one can edit them.
 I was wondering if it is possible to do the same with LaTeX environments like "\begin{equation}" and "\end{equation}", for instance. I've tried with hide-lines.el, which allows for hiding lines matching a regex (in this case, the regex are, for instance: "^\\begin{[a-z]*}"). But although this works, it is far from ideal, as one would need to toggle their visibility for editing them, unlike the more practical way that org-emphasis-hide-markers allows for.
 Is there a way to achieve such result? Thanks in advance for all your help.
 Edit:
 To be clear, I would like to enter something like:
 \begin{equation}
 A = B
 \end{equation}
 and have emacs hide the first and third lines when away from the region, so that only
 A = B
 shows. If possible, I would also like to be able to see the delimiters whenever the point visits the A = B line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use to get Emacs for Mac OS X but now I just download the latest source tarball. I do:  ./configure --with-ns make make install sudo xattr -rds com.apple.quarantine nextstep/Emacs.app  and then move the app bundle to /Applications. But that's not what I'm here to talk about 😃
 When macOS switched to zsh I went through a painful transition. Before then, I had my ns-command-modifier set to meta so M-x would be cmd X for me. With bash, that was ok.
 But zsh opened new possibilities for me and it really wanted the meta on the options key rather than the command key. I honestly don't remember what the pain point was. But in any case, I remapped my emacs to be just the defaults where ns-option-modifier is set to meta and ns-command-modifier is set to super. zsh and emacs have a lot of common abilities so I wanted the key mappings to be the same in both. Rather than twist zsh to accept my unique setup I untwisted my unique emacs setup to be more normal.
 Now, I have an entire set of keys, the "super" keys that I've never had easy access to before.
 For example, using tabs in emacs, I can bind s-{ to tab-previous and s-} to tab-next and switch between tabs just like it was Safari. Instead of two key C-c p for Projectile, (they even suggest), one key s-p. I'm mapping s-r to projectile-rails, s-y to Yari, etc.
 It was and still is a bit painful of a transition but it is well worth it.

What I'm currently doing is: I create 2 files, one includes all the entries, and the other one includes only the most important ones (so that lazy student will read them) and then export both as HTML. Is there is anyway to automate that filtration process?

 My installation of HLS on Visual Studio Code / Linux Mint 20.3 doesn't work. It complains that it cannot determine my version of GHC. But HLS doesn't even do that.
 I enabled debugging as per the manual:
  
Right click on Haskell extension
 Extension settings
 At the bottom of the list: 
 Haskell > Trace:Client set to debug
 Haskell > Trace:Server set to messages
 
 Restart VSCode
 Load the file - error messages...
 Go to OUTPUT tab
 Right side, select Haskell
  
And is says this:
 "Connection to server is erroring. Shutting down server."
 "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by /home/francis/.ghcup/tmp/ghcup-ghc-8.10.7_cabal-3.6.2.0_hls-1.8.0.0_stack-2.7.5/haskell-language-server-wrapper)"
 If I run ldd -- version it returns GLIBC 2.31
 Any thoughts please.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I visit file foo.py, Emacs opens it in python-mode because the extension ".py" appears in auto-mode-alist This is true even if the file doesn't yet exist.
 However, if I simply create a new buffer called foo.py, using M-x switch-to-buffer, without tying it to a file, the new buffer is opened in fundamental-mode.
 Is there a way to set a new buffer's major mode based on its buffer name, rather than (or in addition to) its filename? I haven't found any hooks that would do the trick. Conversely, is there any reason why I don't want to do this?
 Thanks,
 (ETAA: this is slightly different from this question. That one is about setting the one mode to use in a new buffer. Mine is about calling a function to choose a mode dynamically. But that question seems to imply that there's no hook to do what I want.)

It was not easy to learn how put things away slowly, so that I‘ll be ready quickly when needed. Investing time now for time later. It means changing my personal workflow I‘ve trained over years.
And I‘m happy with the results. In the „Project Notes“ section of my Zettelkasten I now can find 73 smart sketchnotes I’ve already published here on LinkedIn, on Twitter or Instagram.
When did you start with your Zettelkasten? What‘s your learning experience?

 If you have already migrated your app(s) to an alternative OAuth method, no further action is required. Please note that if your app(s) is natively installed you may have to request your users to update the app to the newer version to stop using the OOB method.

 I have observed many intermittent "hanging" of emacs on macOS for several months.
 This has not ever happened to me. At first it looked that I could trigger this feature when using mu4e, opening an html message and scrolling with an arrow downwards. This happened often but not immediately. Because I thought maybe this was mu4e related I chose to use a diffrent client (notmuch). Using notmuch the "hanging" did not happen. However, lately I noticed that the "hanging" could happen using consult-ripgrep searching a 2G sharepoint. And now also during just navigating between frames (on laptop and to screens).
 Q: what things could I do to get an idea what triggers emacs to hang? I do not mind recompiling emacs with special options if needed. Thank you, Marcel

 Python (ScalaPy) support has been gradually introduced in the last few releases, along with supporting Markdown (compiling and running Scala code in .md files) and Spark / Hadoop. You might also notice a lot of recent efforts focusing on improving backwards compatibility with scala/scalac. 
 For those who do not know it, Scala CLI is a command-line tool to interact with the Scala language. It's great for learning the language, writing scripts, prototyping and such.

 To have the right overview over the length of the current chapter, I wrote a function that counts the number of characters, starting from the outline-up-heading to the outline-forward-same-level, and divides them by 1.800 to give me a feeling for the number of pages the current chapter has.
 If I start the function in the last chapter, though, I get the error message "No following same-level heading". Of course, there is none, and I'd like to use point-max in this case. But how can I find out whether I'm in the last chapter, using elisp? Is there a way to find out whether there is a header of the same level following?
 Thank you for any advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello 
 I understand that this is for Haskell, but since they both are as I understand very similar, does anyone know any resources for Clean? practice sheets, syntax sheets, tutorials, any resources will be extremely helpful. We are taking it as a course in university and I am facing a lot of trouble trying to search anything related to it on google. Or of course if anyone knows a better place I shoud be asking please let me know.
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have org-roam set up on both personal and work machines. I've researched how people are using roam / roam-alikes but I am reluctant to get going with note-taking as:
 (1) It feels like a big overhead. I don't feel I have time for journalling / processing notes each day; 
 (2) I am concerned that the very beginning of my roam career is crucial to success, and I may develop bad habits or bad practices which will hold my Zettel back; and
 (3) I live on mobile, and roam workflows are not mobile friendly.
 I'd be interested in testing, by reflecting on the experience of others, the following assumptions I have:
 (a) that roam isn't necessary in a professional environment. I already subscribe to regularly-updated professional resources full of hyperlinks;
 (b) that roam doesn't replace my current org-mode setup of a GTD-like system (which I also struggle to review regularly). Rather it sits alongside it as a "reference" asset;
 (c) that the biggest use of org-roam for me would be in hobbies. For example if I wanted to make a video tutorial, or blog post;
 (d) roam isn't a place to store sensitive everyday information (like passport no, social security details etc); and
 (d) roam is not mobile friendly (I hear logseq works, but only for v1)

 I am sysadmin dreaming about shift my career into software development. I have some basis in bash, sql and python and I am using Emacs as an IDE and org mode without deeply hacking my init.el
 Now I decide to learn Elisp from an excellent An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp inside Emacs Info mode and it's quite a lot of fun for my but I am also wandering on my maybe future job or general programming skills will benefits from it and looking for additional motivation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am somewhat new to Haskell, but I wonder, is it possible to write a little automation for my mundane tasks in this language?
 The idea is to program a Windows service that will listen to a hotkey combination and perform some actions after that, for example, with selected text or some buffered data, and then put the result in the clipboard.
 Is it possible to program such service using only Haskell? Or maybe writing pure functions in dll to be called from some Windows-friendly language will be a better solution?
