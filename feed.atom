 I use too much slang and abbreviations I don't want to include in the dictionary and the lingering squiggle annoys and distracts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I'm using vhdl-mode a lot and just decided that it would be a great idea to include compiler vhdl-mode option into my workflow with Emacs. I have to say that I set custom file location for "Easy configuration" on Emacs. 
 (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/emacs-custom.el")
 (load custom-file)
 To select compiler in vhdl-mode there are two ways, and it is little bit confusing to me. I want to use Xilinx XST compiler. Let me explain.
 First, you can select compiler from drop-down menu. There are Compiler1 and Compiler2 options. If you tinker with these options, some text is saved to my emacs-custom.el file, but I can't see that something is configured there. To me it seems like it copied just to whole compilers list into that emacs-custom.el. Maybe it saves some options in other place too and I'm not aware of it?
 Second, which works, but its value is not saved anywhere! It looks like this. I have tried to put (vhdl-set-compiler "Xilinx XST")
 and it returned that error that function is void. If I do it manually by fallowing vhdl-mode drop-down menu, and then selecting "Xilinx XST" compiler, it works. But just in this emacs session. After the restart of emacs, I have to do it again manually :/ 
 my emacs-custom.el : https://pastebin.com/iaTQbK17
 my init.el : https://pastebin.com/4GNLJMQB
 Any help is appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, how are u doing?
 So, I've been exploring ways of implementing "type-dependent"(i think this is the name) validations! But I just stepped into a doubt that is related to "scala-specific" knowledge.
 Lets imagine that I have the following error trait:
 scala sealed trait DomainError trait ValidationError extends DomainError 
 and I want to specify a generic interface for a given Id type that wraps a primitive! This is what I thought on writing:
 scala trait Id[ValueType] type Value val value: ValueType 
 First question: - Is this the right way of writing a trait which defines something like a ProductId that is, basically, Id[UUID]?
 Second Question: - How can I define the interface for the apply method which I should return something like Either[ValidationError[ProductId], ProductId]]?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From TAPL by Pierce:
  
Kinds are built from a single atomic kind, written * and pronounced type, and a single constructor ?. They include, for example:
 * the kind of proper types (like Bool and Bool=>Bool)
 *=>* the kind of type operators (i.e., functions from proper types to proper types)
 *=>*=>* the kind of functions from proper types to type operators (i.e., two-argument operators)
 (*=>*)=>* the kind of functions from type operators to proper types
 Kinds, then, are the types of types. In essence, the system of kinds is a copy of the simply typed lambda-calculus, one level up.
  
If thinking of types as objects in a category, e.g. Hask in Haskell,
  
what is kind * in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? Is it exactly the set of all the types, i.e. the object set of Hask?
 
What is kind *=>* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? Is it exactly the class Functor in Haskell?
 
What is kind *=>*=>* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask?
 
What is kind (*=>*)=>* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? 
 
Are all the arrow kinds (*=>*, *=>*=>*, (*=>*)=>*, ...) exactly the classes defined by class in Haskell?
 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my work often it happens that I get a call to provide immediate support. Only after the call register it under my Support Headline with a full description of the issue and update my org clock time accordingly. 
 As such, I would like to create an org capture template (or function) that does the following: 
 - request how much time has pass since I receive the call 
 - with this time, clock out of my current task with the time of when I receive the call
 - create a new heading under my *Support* heading and include a clock drawer already with the time I spent on the task. Fill new headline as I want (title, description, etc.) 
 - (optional) clock in again to the task I was working
 I almost got everything done, however it seems that calling =org-clock-out= from within the capture template makes it so that the new heading is not in the right place. 
 If someone has any ideas on how to achieve this let me know. Below you can see my capture template and function:
  ("cc" "Support" entry (file+headline "~/org/todos.org" "Support") "%(call-interactively #'custom/quick-support)" :empty-lines 1) (defun custom/quick-support (minutes-started) (interactive "NMinutes:") (let ((support-start-time (encode-time (decoded-time-add (decode-time) (make-decoded-time :minute (- minutes-started)))))) ;; If clocked in a task, stopped it when support started (org-clock-out nil t support-start-time) (concat "* %?\n :CLOCKING:\n CLOCK: " (format-time-string "[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]" support-start-time) "--" ;; Insert dummy => and let Org calculate it afterwards (format-time-string "[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]") " => \n:END:\n")))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, I have two unrelated questions. I have been assigned to do a task to cover for someone. This largely entails copying details out of a template and pasting it into an excel doc. Due to the variety of the email responses, I copy a block from Outlook to an org file and format, then paste into Excel. For example, a person's name is two cells, I found it was quicker for me to put the first and last names on separate lines then copy, esp after I customized copy*.
 1- can I somehow copy the text, so if I copy multiple lines, it fills the cells correctly? Ex first name is column A, last in b.
 2- I have set up an org file, to dump this data, via capture, mostly so I can easily keep a log of when I enter due to an unrelated headache. I have a custom DONE keyword and associated it with a key, but more than often I accidentally have shift held, so org-todo quits. Is there a way to apply my keyword regardless if i press a or A for example? In org-capture, if I assigned a, but do A, we're told to try again. I am aware that allowing this could cause issues if I assign lower and upper to keywords.
 my function
  (defun me/kill-ring-save () "Adds to line to kill-ring if not marked, and puts a message in the minibuffer. If something is marked, that region is added." (interactive) (if (equal mark-active nil) (progn (kill-ring-save (point) (line-end-position)) (message "Copied the line!") ) (progn (kill-ring-save (point) (mark)) (message "Copied selected region!") ) ) )

Do expressions satisfy these identities, which may be used as a translation into the kernel, after eliminating empty stmts:
 do {e} = e do {e;stmts} = e >> do {stmts} do {p <- e; stmts} = let ok p = do {stmts} ok _ = fail "..." in e >>= ok do {let decls; stmts} = let decls in do {stmts} 
  
I often see that people wrote
 do {p <- e; stmts} = e >>= (\p -> do {stmts}) 
  
I was wondering when the shorten version works and when it doesn't? (Does it work if and only if e is return(e') for some e' that matches p?)
 
Can the one given in the specification be rewritten as a >>= expression, for example, still by lambda expression? (The specification gives a let expression containing a >>= expresssion, not exactly a >>= expression itself)

 Also where in the Emacs for beginners tutorials does it explain what to do with such a configuration snippet? If you have a lot of configuration how do you organize it?
 If I need to find out what configuration options are available for a package (like tramp on windows, how do I tell it to use TortoiseGitPlink.exe instead of Plink.exe) how do I discover it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Haskell's specification,
  
Do expressions satisfy these identities, which may be used as a translation into the kernel, after eliminating empty stmts:

What does it mean by
  
"variables bound by let have fully polymorphic types", and
 
"those defined by <- are lambda bound and are thus monomorphic"?
 
 Some examples may also clarify.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'd like to write an embark function for the consult-ripgrep.
 This function can add the current file name to the search prompt.
 What I mean:
 The consult ripgrep prompt is: #whatilookfor
 and after the embark action the prompt is: #whatilookfor -- -g filename*.differentextension
 I can image that if we add this "-- -g filename*.differentextension" to the consult-history and I can reach it with M-p maybe it can be a different good solution 
 I would like to use it to search the string in the files with same name but different extensions.
 It would be useful under the angular development for me ...
 If you can send me an example where an embark function modify the consult prompt could be enough for me 
 sorry for the question but I have no a lot of time to write code for emacs ... :(

 Conversely, can an expression e >>= f, where e is an expression with type m a, andf is a function with type a -> m b, be equivalently converted to an do expression?
 What does the kernel of Haskel consist of exactly? (For example, does it include class Monad, but not do expression?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Sorry for the basic question. I was reading that both native compilation and pure gtk were both merged. I'm on fedora 35. What is the best way to install emacs with these features? Do I have to build it from source? And if so are there specific flags or options that need to be enabled for it to be compiled with those options enabled? or are they enabled by default now?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: I managed to build it from source using the following and it (mostly) works:
 Into a directory: git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git
 Then ran: ./autogen.sh in that directory
 Then ran: ./configure --with-pgtk --with-native-compilation --with-mailutils
 It kept failing until I installed all the following additional packages with sudo dnf install:
  
autoconf (to run the ./autogen.sh command)
 texinfo (for the makeinfo requirement)
 gtk3-devel (for the pgtk requirement)
 libgccjit-devel (for the native-comp requirement)
 gnutls-devel (because it needed gnutls-devel)
 ncurses-devel (it needed something in this package but I forget what)
  
Then ran make (took a while) then sudo make install in the directory and it installed! Emacs 29 I believe to /usr/local/bin

 I don't know if it matters, but my init.el indicates it's an "(Emacs-Lisp Eldoc)". Here's the function:
 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; help with parens (show-paren-mode t) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; emacs needs an unfill ;;; Stefan Monnier <foo at acm.org>. It is the opposite of fill-paragraph (defun unfill-paragraph (&optional region) "Takes a multi-line paragraph and makes it into a single line of text." (interactive (progn (barf-if-buffer-read-only) '(t))) (let ((fill-column (point-max)) ;; This would override `fill-column' if it's an integer. (emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column t)) (fill-paragraph nil region))) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; Some font choices (setq myfont "InputSerif") 
 With the point in or immediately after the defun, executing C-M-x aka M-x eval-defun prints "InputSerif" in the minibuffer.

As a dad of two small kids, the primary caretaker of a house and a phd candidate during pandemic times (I don’t know what went through my head to pursue that route), I highly need some effectivity.
I have started my own zettelkasten and I am trying at the same time to understand how the zettelkasten system works and most importantly how to make it most effective for me. And let’s be honest, I am really torn between analog and digital and see benefits in both. I like the tactile and sensory aspect of the analog, and I like the effectiveness of the digital, plus I learn a lot on software and programmes (thanks to you Forum, markdown has come to my knowledge and I am learning how to use it).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering how to understand in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor
  
Applicative functors are the programming equivalent of lax monoidal functors with tensorial strength in category theory.
  
In Haskell's, class Applicative is defined as
 class Functor f => Applicative f where pure::a->fa (<*>)::f(a->b)->fa->fb 
 A monoidal functor is defined in Mac Lane's book Category Theory for Working Mathematicians, on p164 in VII.1. Monoidal Categories 
  
A (strict) morphism of monoidal categories 
 T: (B, *, e, alpha, lambda, rho)->(B', *', e', alpha, lambda, rho), 
 is a functor T: B-B' such that, for all a, b, c, f, and g 
 T(a*b)=Ta *' Tb, T(f*g) = Tf *' Tg, Te=e', (10) T alpha_{a,b,c} = alpha'_{Ta, Tb, Tc}, T lambda_a = lambda'_{Ta}, T rho = rho'_{Ta}. (11) 
  
How can an instance of class Applicative be viewed as a lax monoidal functor? 
 What is the underlying monoidal category (B, *, e, alpha, lambda, rho) for an instance of Applicative in Haskell?
 What is "lax" here?
 Thanks.

 I know you can select a region and auto indent it by pressing C-M-\, however that doesn't seem to remove hanging braces even though my style is set to not have hanging braces.
 For example, if I highlight the following function and run auto indent
 test_function(void) { std::cout << "This is a test" << std::endl; } 
 I would like it to become 
 test_function(void){ std::cout << "This is a test" << std::endl; } 
 but it doesn't. Anyone know how to make emacs do this?

A quick google lead me to a github issue for lsp-mode that said it's a common problem and that Flycheck was going to release a new version that fixed it. There was linked issue from that one to a github issue on Flycheck's repo about releasing said version from 2020, with no actual traction on finishing the release.
 There haven't been any commits to master since August 2021, regardless of the fact that there are 45 open pull requests, and users requesting that a new release be cut for 2 years. Their CI jobs don't run anymore because they're linked to travis-ci.org which has been in read-only mode since July 2021 and no longer accepts new build jobs.
 Is Flycheck dead? Are people just using snapshots from the repo to make it work? Is there a forked version someone is actually mantaining?

 I am having trouble with my org-mode. Whenever I have a heading, like "* This is a heading" and press RET, I used to be brought to a newline, and moved inwards 3 characters. However, when I press RET currently, under a heading such as in this example, point is not moved, and remains at 0 instead of being moved to 3. Interestingly, when I am in auto-fill-mode, when the text begins to wrap around, it will indent appropriately. I have also found that C-o also does not indent, and is effectively the same as C-j
 I am not sure what has changed, but I am in wayland currently, and I don't think that should have and impact on expected performance, but I would never know.
 I tried org-indent-mode to see if that is what I was missing, but that seems to be doing something else entirely.
 ​
 EDIT: fixed, i had to set org-adapt-indentation
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Hard-indentation.html#DOCF150
 ​
 EDIT2: This change does not seem to be working out, actually. I thought it would, but I still get put at 0 instead of 3 spaces when I use RET under a headline.

While Prelude gets a lot of shit, it's so minimal and unopinionated that it really encourages creating language features as libraries.

It seems to take very little convincing to get the language to do anything you want in the way you want as long as it's logically well formed.
 Personally as someone who loves programming language design it's really incredible, if there's a feature in another language that I want to try, I don't have to switch languages, I can find a package or just stub out an implementation in a weekend. I've heard this used as a point against Haskell however, because it lets you work with very bizzare computational models and can make a code base feel kind of disjointed. Personally, I don't buy that, while Haskell does have modules that let you differ from the norm, the norm tends to be the easiest option. You CAN have Alan Kay style objects, you CAN have prolog style logic programming, but why would you when the language is still so effective without them. Of course, eDSLs are a thing too, tho they're less hot pluggable language features and more an incredibly nice design pattern that arises naturally from the language design unless they're designed to operate more generically.
 Anyway, Haskell is cool and I wanted to talk about it, but I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here.

I have experience with common lisp so I'm not too worried about the actual coding part of this (though the whole dynamic scope of it all sounds interesting) mainly what I'm missing is a guide to things like dependency management, package organization, basic things like that. If anyone here could help me out with these issues I would really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am making a Haskell application that uses a lot of libraries, mostly for things like parsing (megaparsec, aeson, etc) and eventually some RPC or other inter-process library. I have noticed that many of these libraries will return some kind of "Result" type for actions that can fail, often an Either String a or Maybe a or their own custom Result a type. I find it somewhat vexing how these different error types cannot mix because they carry different information, and I would like to be able to propagate them to a higher level in my program where the errors can be handled properly.
 To this end I have added a monadic Result type for my own application that is roughly data Result a = Valid a | Invalid Error where Error is my own error sum type that can represent any external error that the program might have to handle. Result has the obvious Functor, Applicative, and Monad instances, and I use it to wrap most actions that can fail including reading and writing files, parsing, validating user input, and so on.
 Is this a good approach? It seems a little unwieldy to set up so many wrapper functions, but it pays off when I can handle the errors so much more smoothly at the top level. Is there some better method I am missing?

 I'm curious to see how you plan your long term goals with org-mode. I'm interested in workflows and your thoughts.
 In general, I'm pretty successful managing my day to day with org-mode:
  
I have a project list 
 each project is divided into subtasks
  
I push the projects along by executing tasks and reviewing my projects relatively regularly. It's a functional system. In general things don't fall through the cracks.
 However, I feel like most of my planning is short term. This is where "tactical vs strategic" in the title comes from. I'm having trouble elaborating on what I really mean, here.
 Do you have long term goals, if so how do you work with them in org mode?

 From my one semester of Haskell in university I know the basic concepts, but I now want to write a full backend in Haskell.
 I have been using Kotlins Flows for quite a while, and I am looking for something similar in Haskell. Specifically I want to be able to notify other threads about changes, so they can react to them, but not in an active waiting way. In Kotlin I would use a StateFlow or a SharedFlow for this. I've seen the pipes library which looks very similar, but I couldn't figure out to use it in a way, where I have to update a value in one place and all threads are notified about it.
 Probably I am still thinking too much in an imperative way, but maybe you can help me go into the right direction. Thank you for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been spending hours trying to figure this out, but was unable to find anything online with any working examples of what I'm looking for.
 ​
 What I want to do is have one of my Akka-HTTP routes return a response like this:
 [ { name: "test", age: 24 }, { name: "test 2", age: 21 } ] 
 The issue is that the spray-json and akka tutorials only show you how to return a response like this:
 { users: [ { name: "test", age: 24 }, { name: "test 2", age: 21 } ] } 
 While messing around, I tried creating a simple route an an immutable sequence of users like so
 case class User(name: String, age: Int) // ... val usersTest = Seq(User("test, 24), User("test 2", 21)) val routes: Route = { ... route code get { // Should return an array of the users complete(usersTest) } } 
 But the above code throws the following error:
 type mismatch; found : Seq[User] required: akka.http.scaladsl.marshalling.ToResponseMarshallable 
 I'm having a hard time following why that error is being thrown when I have my jsonFormats defined already:
 implicit val userJsonFormat = jsonFormat2(User) 
 ​
 How can I make the route respond with a simple JSON array of the users? I don't want to respond with an object containing a users array, I want the endpoint to respond with an array of the users.
 ​
 Any help is much appreciated!
 Edit: I feel dumb. Thanks for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am new to Org, so I may have missed something obvious but, reading the Quick start guide or the documentation, I am not sure to understand how export is supposed to work in regards to headings. Quoting the Quick start Guide:
  
Lines that start with an asterisk * are headings. 
 A single * denotes a 1st-level heading, ** denotes a 2nd-level heading, etc.
  
So far, everything is clear. We have headings, with levels. Fine. Where I stop following is when I export, say to a html buffer (C-c C-e h H) every heading level has been decreased: one star headings are tagged as h2 and two stars as h3. Here, on a very basic test file: 
 https://preview.redd.it/p9pbaypvm8j81.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=23832603cda8cec5ff07bd711f661d8fe71f2902
 Since I am rather new to Org and to Emacs, I imagined I had some issue with my Org configuration or that I screwed up something elsewhere in Emacs, as I so often do. So I tried on a clean install (no ~/.emacs.d, no init.el) and got the same result, on a Debian 11 machine btw. 
 What's bugging me is that I can't find mention of this in the doc. 
 Could you tell me if it is the expected behavior? And if so, is there a way to tell Org to preserve the original heading levels?
 Thank you :)

The inclusion of the zettelkasten into the lexicon of contemporary productivity scenes, many of which view note-taking systems through the lens of task and project management, has led to confusion as to what a zettelkasten is and for what it can be used. This confusion becomes particularly apparent when comparing zettelkasten to other note-taking methodologies, where the zettelkasten is seen as an advanced (and sometimes outdated) way to store and retrieve notes. I'd like to argue that the zettelkasten should not be considered within the lineage of agnostic note-storing systems and apps, but rather as something else entirely: a note-making and note-linking me…]]></summary>

 I imagine different semigroups have different implementations of append. However, while the compiler can know it'll have to deal with some manner of semigroup, it cannot know ahead of time what each member may be. How is the correct function ultimately determined? Is there some runtime check with the equivalent of typeof/instanceof which decides the correct function?
 I guess a related question is what happens in practice if data don't match their type? For example, if I ask a database for data, expecting a sequence of integers, but a cosmic ray conspires to ruin my day, and I end up getting garbage. Obviously this is a runtime error, but how can I reason about it or deal with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have just released new versions of both Indigo (game engine) and Tyrian (Elm-like web framework). They've been release together because they now work together!
 As well as lots of other improvements, you are now able to build a web app in Tyrian that natively launches and communicates with Indigo web games as first class citizens, from within the same Scala codebase.
 The motivating use case was for people who wanted to use Indigo to render their games, but who also wanted a slick, responsive HTML5 based UI to drive it.
 Please note that both minor releases follow an unannounced major release a week ago, so do check out the release notes for both. 
 Indigo 0.12.1 - https://indigoengine.io/
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.12.0
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.12.1
 Tyrian 0.3.1 - http://tyrian.indigoengine.io/
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.3.0
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.3.1
 ​
 A massive thank you to all the wonderful people who have sponsored us, contributed code, reviewed PR's, written/proof read docs, raised issues, discussed solutions, or bravely shared their work in progress games and apps! You make it all worth while. 😊

 I don't have csharp-mode hooks enabled in my dot emacs, so I load a ".cs" file, and then type "M-x csharp-mode". I get this error:

 Syntax highlighting does NOT occur (except for strings and comments, for some reason). However, the mode line does say that csharp-mode IS activated for the file. 
 I don't understand why R-mode is involved with this process at all. I do have ESS installed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I attempt to gather all ideas/approaches that were in usage to manage app dependencies. As far as I see there are two survivors nowadays: - mix of constructors/implicits in Tagless Final world - "Reader on steroids" represented by ZIO (Reader channel, Has[T], and ZLayer) and cats-mtl (Ask[F, T] feature) (thanks to u/LuciaDenniard for bringing the second option)
 I want to write a note with a review of which things were in usage but were washed out.
 The roster I have:
  
Dependency rejection. Just an idea to push any IO to the edges and not mix with logic.
 Dependency injection frameworks (Guice-like)
 Cake pattern.
 Dependency parameterization (dependencies as function parameters).
 Reader monad (as is)
 
 Resources I found useful: - "Readers vs Constructors: Dependency Injection showdown" and "Reader & Constructor-based Dependency Injection - friend or foe?" by u/adamw1pl - "Dependency Injection in Functional Programming" Gist by Gabriel Volpe - Cake antipattern by Mateusz Kubuszok - "Six approaches to dependency injection" from "F# for Fun and Profit" - "Dependency rejection" and "Partial application is dependency injection" by Mark Seemann
 I'll be grateful for any additional resources and/or points I've missed.
 Thank you!

But it seems to me that even if I replaced f with g :: (a,b) then g is still ambiguous (again, if I have multiple instances). So why is there that restriction?
 I am aware of FunctionalDependencies, but it seems to me that it shouldn't be required that b is uniquely determined by a. Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you have a high level language it seams easier to desugar it to a small core language when type checking. However I don't understand how type errors can then be reversed back to the original syntax. What are known strategies for doing this? It seems like you would have to litter your core AST with annotations of some kind, is this what most people do?
 I remember reading somewhere that haskell implements the typechecker closer to the original syntax because then it is easier to relate errors to the original source. However there is still some desugaring that occurs, and I'm wondering if there is a sweet spot in balancing desugaring vs tracking original source?

Is this the expected behaviour?
 Can I trim this down to one Org version, preferably the 9.5.2 and the generally speaking the most recent one?
 If this is the expected behaviour what is the purpose of each Org version? I find it strange that I cannot use the most recent stable version but still need it for dependencies.

Completed the initial processing of notes from the biography of John Cage Where The Heart Beats 202107261132.
Spent too much time fretting about the Science Profile assignment interview that never happened.
Looked again at Zettlr then settled back into The Archive.
This Week
I'll add deep links and atomize Where The Heart Beats 202107261132. I'll start a second refactoring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
I recently discovered the Zettelkasten system and thought it seemed a disciplinary and constructive tool for someone who makes connections between ideas all day long but doesn't write them down (like me). I've gotten as far as downloading Obsidian, reading the first chapter of a book called "The Bitcoin Standard," writing fleeting notes, and then polishing the relevant ones into literature notes. What repeatedly evades my understanding, however, is the nature of links.
I do not know when or how to use links. For example, if I have a note that defines the economic term "coincidence of wants," and I have another note discussing how "indirect exchange enables coincidence of wants in a diverse economy," should I: reference "coincidence" inside "indirect exchange"; reference "indirect exchange" in "coincidence"; do both of those; not link them at all but tag both notes with "coincidence of wants" and find them when I do the color-coded tag search?
And then there's the matter of linking two (seemingly) unrelated ideas. Do they get linked to each other, and then to a third note of the new idea they inspire? Both notes separately linked to the third?
Help is appreciated.]]></summary>

I tried to use bind* from use-package, I tried general, I tried so many things I've lost count, but I can't use C-k for the real shell or the Eshell. Why is this, and is there a sane way around it? For now I've settled down on using arrows:
  (general-define-key :states 'normal "<left>" 'windmove-left "<right>" 'windmove-right "<down>" 'windmove-down "<up>" 'windmove-up) 
 But I am not happy about it. Doubly so because I just don't understand why no override works.

 Bonus points if doing the above can also automatically carry over the URL that I'm currently on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross post from https://fillian.me/code/bongo-retag/
 ​
 bongo is a package for listening to music within Emacs.
 I keep all my music on my computer with filenames readable by bongo like this:
 Artist - Album - Track Num - Song Name.mp3
 ​
 I like having all the metadata stored in the filename instead of in internal ID3 tags for a few reasons:
  
filenames are easy to change
 everything is visible at a glance
 it stops me from spending too much time re-tagging and organizing my library
  
​
 The problem is that when I sync my music library to my phone using Syncthing, the music app I use doesn't read the metadata from the filename - it uses the standard ID3 tags.
 ​
 My solution was to write a small script which reads metadata from the filename and overwrites the internal ID3 tags to match.
 Whenever I add new music to my library, I'll run this script and then I'll be able to browse easily on my phone. The source of truth for metadata will always be the filename.
 ​
 The script is written in Python and requires a library called eyeD3
 You can find the it here
 Pass the script a directory and it will re-tag all the .mp3 files inside and in any sub-directories.
 ​
 It's nice to have album cover images when listening on my phone, so the script will overwrite a cover image if there is a file that matches Artist - Album.jpg in the same directory as the mp3.

 1. a backend (lsp-mode in his case)
 2. a frontend (typescript-mode in his case)
 3. a language server (ts-ls in his case)
 So I was wondering if this scheme holds true even for c/c++, if so, what packages for these three "categories" do I need?

 haskell data Withdrawal = Withdrawal { wTarget :: !Text, wAmount :: !Cash, wBalance :: !Cash } data Fee = { fFee :: !Cash, fBalance :: !Cash } -- many more 
 I use those types, because I have functions that are transaction-type specific.
 I also wanted to write an activity parser that translates CSV records into those types, so I created an Activity sum type:
 ```haskell data Activity = ActivityFee Fee | ActivityWithdrawal Withdrawal | -- ...
 parseActivity :: CsvRecord -> Activity ```
 That Activity is quite boilerplate'y. Having to have a new Activity* constructor for a new activity type is slightly cumbersome.
 Is there a more idiomatic or better design pattern for this problem? Was it C++, std::variant would be convenient, because adding a new activity type wouldn't entail adding a new boilerplate constructor.
 I've considered type-classes, but the problem with them is that they are not closed and I can't pattern match to create a function like applyActivity :: Activity -> Wallet -> Wallet. I see that I could make applyActivity into a function of an Activity class, but then problem is that this solution is only straightforward if only one argument is using this pattern. If we had two arguments like foo :: (ClassOne a, ClassTwo b) => a -> b -> c, then it's not clear to which class foo should belong.

 recently I've been playing with org-element and org-export.
 Specifically, I was interested in the mechanism of the org exporter system and its flexibility.
 The goal of this post is to get you started with the creation of org backends.
 To do so, we build an org backend that:
  
keeps only bold elements,
 surrounds bold elements with *** before and after,
 surrounds paragraph elements with :: before and after,
 surrounds section elements with <-- before and --> after (removing the last newline).
  
We call it onlybold.
 Before, we start, if you are interested, I recommend you to read in org-mode's source code the following files:

 I'm trying to teach someone what a function is conceptually beyond just (a -> b), so that they can recognize it when they see it in any context, regardless of language. I have been trying to come up with a type, or a diagram, to explain it.
 The essential pieces I see for a function are a parameter assignment, a computation, and a return. The type at the top is meant to capture these and the diagram for this would be a square.
 I also think that this can be used to define an arrow, except the first argument would be an identity on the input, the second the arrow, and the third argument would be an identity on the output.
 This is how I sketch functions and arrows when I imagine them but I don't know if anyone else's imagination agrees.

 Some months ago I read the excellent article "Avy can do anything (https://karthinks.com/software/avy-can-do-anything/), which changed the way I use Avy and Emacs in general. The article basically explains what are Avy actions and how to create new ones. This got me inspired to create my own Avy actions, which I'd like to share with the community in the form of a literate config.
 The shared config, extends some notions and creates new ones (some left as a kind-of challenge in the mentioned article):
 ​
 - Region actions: actions that act in an arbitrary not visible region created with avy selections (copy, yank, kill, teleport). First you mark the initial point of the region with an action, then you execute a region action on the other end of the region.
 - Quick char commands: skip the initial filtering step of an Avy command pre-filtering a character. For example I use this in emacs-lisp mode to auto filter open parenthesis with a key binding, this is very useful as actions act on Sexp.
 - Auto actions: enable the automatic execution of an avy action on a selected candidate
 - Compound actions and commands: link several avy interactions in a single command or action using auto actions. This is useful for example for region actions, instead of executing two Avy commands to first mark the start of the region with a command and then select and act on the end of the region; you only execute a command that integrates two Avy interactions, the first one auto applies the mark action, then you select the action and element at the end of the region. I also use this for creating a replace action, combining kill and yank actions in one action.
 ​
 I hope this results useful for someone.

 Since my last post in this Reddit, it has got some new features, of which probably the most interesting is to remove read-only status, but still keep org markup hidden. It is meant for simple edits like fix a spelling mistake or add/remove a word or two. For bigger edits, drop back into org-mode. There are some other minor additions, hiding some agenda keywords and ellipses. The last one is not really recommended, but it can be useful only in some very special cases.
 For the usage info, check the README file in the Github repository.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear community,
 I'm looking for a comparison of the various note-taking-packages implementing the Zettelkasten-method. I don't want to build a second brain or create a personal wiki, instead I want to capture and link ideas for researching and writing.
 Using org, I'm naturally drawn to org-roam, however, I dislike the bulk of dependencies and its complexity stemming. Furthermore, I dislike, that I can't get a textual overview of a subset of notes belonging together (using a webserver-solution like org-roam-ui is not what I want here). Looking at the new zk-package, I want to note that I like its simple and clean approach, but I dislike, certain design decisions, like using spaces in file names and the fact, that it doesn't integrate deeply in the org-ecosystem, e.g. not utilizizing org-IDs. The last point is the biggest downside imho. While one could hack on the codebase to change this, another drawback seems to be that it is not really mature and doesn't seem to have a large userbase. 
 Currently, I'm try out both of these very different options, but I can't really decide for on or the other, since both have different strengths and downsides. Therefore, I want ask for your opinions and experience with implementing the Zettelkasten-method (or a personalized derivation of it). Which horse should I put?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys.
 I'm trying to get started with Reflex/Obelisk as we have a few quite simple UI use-cases that would benefit highly from sharing code between the front-end and back-end.
 However, struggling to get one thing working - HLS.
 Setting up an Obelisk project was actually remarkably easy.
 ob shell, ob run and ob watch work perfectly.
 However, when I open up VS code from within the nix-shell hls is failing with some very weird errors.
  Unexpected usage error can't load .so/.DLL for: /nix/store/jc9zqp241vz5ziwh0smls0sl1sf6h7np-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/libHSghc-prim-0.5.3-ghc8.6.5.so (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by /nix/store/jc9zqp241vz5ziwh0smls0sl1sf6h7np-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/libHSghc-prim-0.5.3-ghc8.6.5.so)) typecheck 
 I assume this is because it's reaching for my local installation of haskell-language-server (it's pointed to the 8.6.5 version, so that's not the issue), but absolutely no idea how to approach this.
 Is there some working repository example or a tutorial for IDE integration that doesn't require you to know Nix in order to make any sense of it?

 After a recent update(?), this function no longer works. I have tried taking SVG out of the list of inline image formats in ox-html, but it just inlines the file with a tags. The transclusion of the full source is not happening.
 Any ideas?

There is an issue, however, when I have two windows side-by-side in i3-gaps and open a search (for example for a file).

The issue goes away if I put emacs on full screen mode.
 Does anyone know of a solution or why this is happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I am back with my persistent request to you fellow Scala users to "Star" some projects on Github.
 Why ? 
 Because the "Github Stars" have somehow evolved into the easiest available indicator of popularity and trustworthyness of a project.
 And yes, I know that "Github Stars" are not really a good indicator of quality and trust. And they were just meant to be like a bookmark.
 But probably even the Github guys did not foresee the open-source explosion which took place in last 5-6 years and Github became the de-facto home for opensource community. With the rise of "the like/subscribe culture" of Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn during these times, our community was also craving for that "like/follow/subscribe" button, and they found the "Star button".
 Yes, it is a bad indicator but an indicator none the less.
 ​
 So, please take few seconds of your time to hit that "like/follow/subscribe". It might just help in giving outsiders more confidence in our excellant ecosystem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: THIS HAS BEEN ANSWERED, THANKS!
 I'm a newbie. From: https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html
 It says the following:
 You must insert a comma right before lines starting with either ‘*’, ‘,*’, ‘#+’ or ‘,#+’ 
 Is this a mistake in the text? Why would I need to put a comma before a line starting with ,*? I'd end up with ,,*.
 Then they give the following example:
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE ,* I am no real headline #+END_EXAMPLE 
 But wouldn't it be sufficient without the begin end?
 ;; This will work too ,* I am no real headline 
 For that matter, wouldn't it be sufficient to have just about any character there, including a space? 
 ;; This will work too * I am no real headline 
 EDIT: It just occurred to me that I'm thinking mainly in terms of how emacs is parsing and presenting the information within the editor as I type, but there might be other issues with the system processing the text, such as for agendas, exporting, etc.

 This is a screen shot from part of my FastMail IMAP email inbox in Mu4e.
 Lots of inbox email headers, each crossed out, but still listed in the inbox.
 All of these emails have been archived or moved via the MacOS Mail program, or iOS Mail app but they show up like this here, which means that they have been trashed from Mu4e's perspective.
 I'm trying to work out how to make my Mu4e display consistent with what iPhone or Mac Mail shows me. I.E. If I archive an email in iOS Mail, the reference to it is no longer displayed in Mu4e so that I don't have to do everything twice.
 I have followed this setup pretty much exactly but applied to FastMail.
 Can somebody point in the right direction please?

 Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Ideally I wanna get GHC for ppc into Macports, but if I manage to build it locally, I can open a PR.

In addition to the part included in the example, I found this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/38184/org-mode-ignore-heading-when-exporting-to-latex and added this to my config: (require 'ox-extra) (ox-extras-activate '(ignore-headlines)) and I added titletoc to my default packages as well. This indicates ‏‏‎ that titletoc has to be included before the hyperref package. This is what my packages setup looks like: (setq org-latex-default-packages-alist '(("rm" "roboto" t) ("defaultsans" "lato" t) ("" "paracol" t) ("" "titletoc" t))) There's no reference to the hyperref package anywhere in the file, but the output file indicates that package hyperref has indeed been loaded. Could the issue be that titletoc is not loading before hyperref, and if so, how can I make it do that? If that is not the issue, any ideas on what troubleshooting I can try next? Thanks all!

 I think Persistent-odbc is the only version that can work with MSSQL, but persistent-odbc doesn't pair with newer versions of Persistent as Persistent updated its datatypes. I thought selda was neat, but its DB language metatypes (I don't know if that's the right name) are in a closed data type rather than an open typeclass declaration. MSSQL has many database column types so having type class declarations of the translation DB language metatype would allow for more flexibility for the ORM to handle multiple databases.
 I'm going to try to rewrite selda's types to handle extensible column definitions.

After a bit, I came up with:  (>=>) :: (a -> m b) -> (b -> m c) -> (a -> m c) (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b ma >>= f = ((\_ -> ma) >=> f) id -- apply to it a junk value 
 Since the result of applying >=> returns a function, I need to call the function with a junk value to make it return just m b . Was I correct in my approach? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When testing the basic functionality of my actors, my receiveMessage() event on my test probe is timing out, because the probe isn't listening for messages on the actor that I've spawned.
 ​
 For some context, I have 2 actors
  
A TaskManager actor
 A Session actor
  
My TaskManager actor has 2 commands:
  
CreateSession(id) - This spawns a new Session actor
 SessionCreated(id, ref) - When a Session actor is spawned, it sends the SessionCreated message back to the TaskManager so that I can store the ref of the session (and perform other stuff)
  
Here's where I'm running into the issue. I can't seem to figure out how to write a test to listen for messages coming back to the TaskManager actor that I spawned. When running the test, it times out waiting for the receiveMessage() event.
 Here's my test code:
  "Task Manager" must { "be able to create sessions and receive a reply from the session when its created" in { val taskManager = spawn(TaskManager()) val sessionProbe = createTestProbe[SessionCreated]() taskManager ! CreateSession("session1") val reply = sessionProbe.receiveMessage() // ^^ times out } } 
 I've been searching the docs and Googling everywhere, but I can't seem to find any documentation on how to listen for a message that should come back to an Actor that was spawned in the test.
 ​
 I've tried adding a new parameter to the CreateSession message to supply the probe ref, but then the probe receives the message instead of the taskManager actor, and thus the taskManager won't complete the changes that I need to test subsequently. I do know that the taskManager value does have a ref, but it doesn't have a receiveMessage method, so I'm stumped here.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated! Sorry for the noob question :-)

 I tried Udemy, but there doesn't seem to be anything useful on there.
 I am rather limited in terms of free time, having young children and a busy career.
 Can someone on here please recommend a way for me to make progress with learning eLisp from nearly scratch?
 I have a few years of Java experience, so am well familiar with basic concepts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a pycharm/visual studio user, but recently vim caught my eye. While figuring out of vim was what I wanted I kept seeing these "vim vs emacs" yt videos and articles, which got me to check out emacs, which at the time looked very similar to vim (to my "mouse focused gui"-using eyes). After some digging i found distro tubes video on doom emacs which really sold me, but here's the issue: although it's relatively easy to find content telling you why to use emacs, there really doesn't seem to be any content telling you how to use emacs. 
 I really feel like I've walked into a car showroom, been shown this cool, futuristic car with no visible doors or windows. But as soon as I said "cool, how do I get into it, so I can test drive it?" The salesman just started starting blankly at me as if I'm the weirdo for not already knowing. 
 This post was mainly to express my woes, but I am very open to being directed to resources on how to get started, especially seeing it up for c# and python.

 So Command + V in iTerm2 is the paste action.
 However, I tried looking in the settings but am unaware of how to remap the default paste option since I swap a few keys on my Emacs setup on MacOS.
 Related swaps:
 Caps --> Control
 Option --> Control
 Is it possible to nuke the default Command + V 'paste' keybinding in iTerm2 for Emacs?
 This interferes with normal Emacs keybindings since Command + V on my setup on normal Emacs on MacOS usually advances the screen by 1 screenful.

CONTEXT
#Zettelkasten-method #cognitive-overload #quick-revision
I am relatively new to Zettelkasten (but have come across it earlier) and have just begun using Zettlr. I was trying to figure out whether for my use case, the method of Zettelkasten (which fascinates me) would be a good idea.
Previous experience suggests it is risky. I got hooked on Org-mode and Spacemacs spending time on setting it up when I had a deadline approaching. When I finally realised I was out of time, I quickly turned to drafting my work in Textedit (Mac) and polishing it up in Word for the final PDF submission. This was efficient given time crunch, familiarity with tools etc. and worked well for a shorter piece.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm writing some functionality in elisp which only works when I step through the expressions using Edebug and "space" but it fails when running in a regular manner. I know where the script fails in terms of a specific line, I just don't know of a mechanism in which the outcome is different due to stepping vs. regular run. Here is the code:
 (defun df/cite () (interactive) (defvar df/cite-title "") (defvar df/cite-buffer (current-buffer)) (org-ref-insert-cite-link) (org-ref-open-citation-at-point) (setq df/cite-title (bibtex-autokey-get-field "title" bibtex-autokey-titleword-change-strings)) (switch-to-buffer df/cite-buffer) (end-of-visual-line) (backward-char) (insert (format "[%s]" df/cite-title)) (end-of-visual-line)) 
 The code lets you insert an org-ref citation and uses the article's title (from the bibtex) entry as the org link description. The script works line by line in edebug but fails as a whole on the line running "open-citation-at-point". Not sure why.

So the algorithm would add a node and for each node two empty lists that denote it's two subtrees. However, I am stuck at initializing a BST in the first place. So when I insert a number into an empty BST:
 insert 5 [] 
 it would return a list like so:
 [5, [], []] 
 This is what I have:
 insert x lis = if null lis then [x, [], []] else undefined --for now 
 I thought the function declaration would have to be:
 insert :: Integer -> [Integer] -> [Integer] 
 But that doesn't work. If you know how to solve this, I would also appreciate reference material where these things are covered. I am struggling to find relevant documentation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know stack doesn't love M1 macs, but it seems to work fine as long as I run it in a Rosetta terminal with the --arch x86_64 flag.
 Today, though, I'm trying to install the yesod bin following the Yesod quickstart guide, and not having any luck. (I'm in a Rosetta terminal and adding --arch x86_64 to stack commands.)
 The error occurs at the step of installing the yesod command line tool (step 3); this fails with:
 <command line>: can't load framework: Cocoa (not found) 
 Is it even possible to work with the yesod command line tool on an M1? If so, am I just making some boneheaded mistake?
 EDIT: Problem kinda solved! See comment for what I did.

 I learned today about running grep from within emacs. I tried it out, and the results were spoiled by the inclusion of files from my mypy folder, which aren't of interest. I could modify the grep command to excplude that folder, but I'm lazy. I'd prefer to be able to click on the output and say "hide this and anything else from the same folder".
 I'd also like to be able to interactively toggle the -h option, to hide the filenames on the left side.
 Is this possible? I see that I can jump to the file, and the line in question, which is great. Other than that, though, the output does not seem to be very interactive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started using orgmode two months ago after I learnt about it from videos from thoughtbot. Never having used emacs before and not knowing lisp it took me while to ramp up on it. I found the way you can have neatly nested lists and have math equations quite nice. I set up org roam as well . Everything on doom emacs. But after 2 months of using it I find myself in a situation where it has turned out to be not all I expected it to be. * The org roam promise of becoming a second brain didn't really work for me. Maybe I'm not using it correctly but having backlink info in the buffer I didn't find that useful. It's not easy to find things unless you remember the name or keywords in the title.
  
Writing long documents feels clunky in orgmode. Maybe it's more adapted to short todos. I don't know how to explain it
 
Export options : I can export to pdf but the output often doesn't look good with the weird section numbering. Having nested items looks good inside orgmode but not in an exported pdf. There's no option to export to doc that I'm aware of. It makes collaboration with others difficult
 
It doesn't work well with tools my team uses with slack and google docs. 
 
And many others
 
 Has anyone else felt like this? What am I doing wrong? I'm planning to go back to vs code and mark down files because emacs looks like a big investment. But I really like the idea of a macro enabled editor.
 Edit: I didn't expect such useful and positive feedback from everyone. You guys are the best. I found some promising stuff . I'm going to give it another try. Thanks!

I have previously built a normal artificial network using hmatrix for linear algebra operations (BLAS, etc.) but now that I need to do convolutions, I have to somehow parallelise my code. I looked into the obvious packages for parallel arrays such as repa arrays and the accelerate package. accelerate is an embedded DSL which I think would make the code quite unelegant and I want to stay as close to Haskell as possible. Further, I am working on a Windows PC with a CUDA capable GPU but also a MacBook Pro 2021 so I'd have to implement both accelerate and some other package for non-CUDA PCs as well.

If you open a new window (from the Window menu), it opens a second copy of The Archive. Normally, this window operates independently of the first window.
But what I hadn't realized is that, if you have the second window open and highlighted, you can right click on links in the (unhighlighted) first window. If you hover over a link, right click and select Open Link in that window, it leaves the first window on its current page, and opens the link in the second window. Very cool. This is really useful for copying material between documents that are part of the same "tree" of documents, without losing your place or leaving the current document.]]></summary>

 This seems to work if I've already opened the org file and org-mode has been run. It fails on the first run when opening Emacs (beca…]]></summary>

 I use Debian 11 with KDE. So far, I was on KDE X11 and I ran the emacs daemon as a service (debian configures this for you ootb, so you simply need to enable it).
 However, I moved to a KDE wayland setup today, and I cannot launch the client after boot. I think it is launching before wayland can set things up (I have no idea what that means though...).
 journalctl --user -u emacs.service | tail -n 10 gives me
 Feb 17 15:39:39 xxx emacs[1302]: Loaded /home/x/.emacs.d/config/settings.el Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode... Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode...done (0.330s, 90 buffers checked) Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Starting Emacs daemon. Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx systemd[1282]: Started Emacs text editor. Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx emacs[1302]: Package cl is deprecated Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx systemd[1282]: emacs.service: Got notification message from PID 3258, but reception only permitted for main PID 1302 Feb 17 15:41:51 xxx emacs[1302]: No protocol specified Feb 17 15:45:53 xxx emacs[1302]: No protocol specified 
 So I am guessing the daemon loads properly and then encounters some problems after the Package cl is deprecated message. If I try to run the client with emacsclient -c I get
 Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Display :1 can’t be opened 
 Which is very strange since systemctl status --user emacs.service shows that the service is indeed active. Any help/suggestions/comments?
 Cheers

 Recently I've been looking for a new keyboard and I sort of settled on the Moonlander or Planck. Moonlander is a full fledged ergonomic keyboard and Planck is a smaller (40%) keyboard. I will often have the keyboard with me as I'm working at home and a couple of different locations at work, therefore the small planck is tempting. Anyone that uses Planck with Emacs? Will it be better to buy a larger ergonomic keyboard? 
 Any input will be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, due to the latest Arch update of latest gcc & gcc-libs (they package it so), libgccjit was broken. I had to uninstall it so I could upgrade rest of the system, and my Emacs didn't start due to missing libgccjit.so. So I quickly recompiled Emacs without native compiler, and surprise. I don't even miss native compiler. 
 I used to see a difference in Helm and some other places like a year ago when native comp was in its early stages. I don't have benchmarks, but my Emacs seems like even smoother without native comp for some reason. There are no hiccups, no waiting for completions to pop up. What happened? I run current master, re-compiled like 2 days ago.
 I now even wonder if I will enable native comp again. Is it just me, or do other people experience similar?

 I'm a prose writer and have converted my markdown novel into org.
 The meat
  
Since I don't use text editors for code, I'd like to have emacs "know" to use helvetica when I open an *.org file. I'd done something similar in vim where markdown files would word wrap at 100 characters and a few other things I've since forgotten. (I haven't written in over a year and it's been longer than that since I edited init.vim
 I've been playing around with prelude-emacs … distro? I'd like to use vanilla emacs but add whatever package pops up a mini-buffer? With hints after chording C-c or M-x
 TLDR
  
What variable should I look at to have org mode use helvetica font? What package gives hints after typing C-c , M-x etc

 Next, configure the input method for your Window Manager according to the guide above. After you do that, you can now change input method using s+SPACE So now you can have a workflow.
 - Go to emacs
 - Open a file and type some bangla texts.
 - If you need to type commands, do s+SPACE to move back to English.
 Its fairly obvious but I thought it might be helpful for some beginners who searched for similar feature, like me. And also, its not nearly as seamless as M-x set-input-method bengali-itrans which automatically handles all of these for you and gives you an amazing writing experience. Sadly, it does not yet provide avro-style input-method and the existing itrans,probhat are really unorthodox input method that very few uses and hard to master. I hope someday I will have enough knowledge to contribute that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know plenty of people come to emacs from Vim, so it makes sense to use evil, spacemacs, etc, but I rarely if ever see the other way around. I've been doing vanilla emacs for a bit, and while I'm used to it, I definitely don't love the navigation shortcuts, and I've always been very interested in how Vim works.
 Anyone here was already used to and comfortable with regular emacs bindings and decided to learn Vim keybindings?
 Did you think it was worth it? Did you keep it or went back to vanilla emacs? Do you use it only in certain contexts? Any tips for how to pursue it?

 TL;DR: Would appreciate some feedback about my WIP Emacs theme. Link: https://github.com/qhga/shanty-theme
 Last week I finally had the time to do one thing that was on my bucket list for quite some time: Write my own Emacs color theme.
 It is not available on MELPA yet, because I first wanted to ask some fellow Emacs users about their opinion. So far, the one person that also uses Emacs and I know irl thinks it is quite pleasant. But I would appreciate a bit more feedback, so here I am.
 It is still a WIP so every feedback is very welcome (: For now, I only included packages I use on a regular basis, but I'll try to slowly but surely add dedicated support for more packages (requests welcome). Most of the other packages I know have sane inheritance and could still be usable right now. I am by far not an elisp-pro but I tried my best to provide a dark and a light version without too much duplicate code.
 If you wanna check it out, here is the link: https://github.com/qhga/shanty-theme
 Thanks <3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get GNUS to show article fullscreen after select on summary screen. I found out about gnus-buffer-configuration variable where is configuration of how screen should by displayed. I also found gnus-add-configuration function to modify. I tried to set article settings to:
 (article (vertical 1.0 (article 1.0 point))) 
 But when I try to open article I get gnus-summary-show-thread: Args out of range: 0 and empty buffer is open in fullscreen. I also tried without point:
 (article (vertical 1.0 (article 1.0))) 
 since I got same error when I tried to reset to default and I forgot to delete points from behind the article:
 (gnus-add-configuration '(article (vertical 1.0 (summary 0.25 point) (article 1.0 point)))) 
 I also tried to get (summary 0) but that was some other error and I thing it also does not make much sense.
 Anybody tried similar thing? How to setup GNUS to open article fullscreen?
 EDIT: I tried to debug gnus a little bit and I find out that responsible function for shoving thread is gnus-summary-show-thread, but can't understand what exactly it is doing, from mi point of view I see only some tinkering with cursor position and something called overlays:
 (defun gnus-summary-show-thread () "Show thread subtrees. Returns nil if no thread was there to be shown." (interactive nil gnus-summary-mode) (let* ((orig (point)) (end (point-at-eol)) (end (or (gnus-summary--inv end) (gnus-summary--inv (1- end)))) ;; Leave point at bol (beg (progn (beginning-of-line) (if (bobp) (point) (1- (point))))) (eoi (and end (next-single-char-property-change end 'invisible)))) (when eoi (remove-overlays beg eoi 'invisible 'gnus-sum) (goto-char orig) (gnus-summary-position-point) eoi)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's a bit of a strange post, but I hope it may spark some positive discussion: Emacs recently get tab support. First AFAIK from Centaur Emacs and then upstream. Tabs are common UI elements since years, however IMVHO in most cases are a very bad idea as they are normally: modern monitor are 16:9 and most people use them straight, not 90° rotated, so plenty of horizontal space, very little vertical one and tabs eat some of it while still being unable to scale well...
 On contrary "experiments" like Tab Center Redux (it's successor Tab Center Reborn) Firefox extension show that vertical tabs can scale well, they might be "hard to choose" at first, but actually work pretty well. They remain easy to read even when they are many, they might be scrollable if needed, integrated with switch-buffer search&narrow packages, they might co-exist with a sidebar (like those popular in IDEs), even on one and another side of the screen and potentially spark new UI ideas to extend them further. 
 What do you think about that?

 ​
 Emacs and Preview displaying the same PDF, where it is much darker in Emacs
 I am not sure why this happens -- I haven't changed any settings related to DocView or enabled any minor modes that would cause this. Disabling my current emacs config (by moving .emacs.d) does not resolve this. I am using the mituharu emacs-mac port from this Homebrew formula, but the issue also exists with the build from https://emacsformacosx.com. My .emacs.d is on GitHub here.
 Has anyone encountered a similar issue before? How would I go about resolving this?
 UPDATE:
 I found out that the issue is caused by GhostScript, as expressed in this comment. I've resolved it by installing mupdf (brew install mupdf), which should cause docview to use mudraw to convert PDFs to temporary PNGs instead of GhostScript. After installing mupdf, opening a PDF in DocView and running doc-view-clear-cache should resolve the issue.

 I already have org capture templates set up to make next action entries.
 What I want to do now, is make the next action entry have a link to the email that the action is about (i.e. the one I was reading when I invoked the capture template)... but if I invoke the capture template from someplace other than an email, I don't want there to be a link in it.
 So if I'm in an email, I want C-c c a w to open this template:
 ("aw" "Work Related" entry (file+headline "~/mygtd.org" "Work") "* TODO %? %a %u \n\n ") 
 But if I'm someplace other than an email, I want the same key combination C-c c a w to open this template:
 ("aw" "Work Related" entry (file+headline "~/mygtd.org" "Work") "* TODO %? %u \n\n ") 
 Which is exactly the same, except it has no %a in it.
 How would I do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 seems I am too stupid to customize modes for my text file editing, either via manually changing the .emacs or via M-x customize or via Easy Customize menu. Have read all online doc, internet search, "Learning GNU Emacs" book. Have tested dozens of variants given in these sources for manual changes in .emacs, but regardless which variant, when I open my file, none is active and shown in mode line. Only I managed to set fill-column via Easy Customize dialog ad the adwaita look.
 I simply want to have text-mode, enriched-mode, auto-fill-mode, flyspell-mode set as standard for working buffer. 
 Here is my latest .emacs: 
 (custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(add-hook 'text-mode-hook t)
 '(ansi-color-faces-vector
 [default default default italic underline success warning error])
 '(ansi-color-names-vector
 ["black" "red3" "ForestGreen" "yellow3" "blue" "magenta3" "DeepSkyBlue" "gray50"])
 '(custom-enabled-themes '(adwaita))
 '(display-fill-column-indicator t)
 '(fill-column 75)
 '(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
 '(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'enriched-mode)
 '(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode))
 (custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 ) 
 If anyone could advise, I would be happy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble customizing emacs.
 I have learned how to use hooks to switch things on and off, e.g.:
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode) 
 So that text files will open with word wrap on.
 What I've not been able to do is to pass a value in on starting a mode, e.g.:
 ``` doesn't work
 (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'text-scale-adjust 3))
 or
 (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'text-scale-adjust &eval ('text-scale-adjust 3))
 doesn't work
 ```
 I'm sure you can see what I'm trying to do -- when in text mode, automatically enlarge the text so that I can read it.
 I have read the manual -- but unfortunately that part of the manual (23.1.1 Running Hooks) doesn't give any examples.
 I think the bit that reads: "If a hook variable has a non-nil value, that value should be a list of functions. run-hooks calls all the functions, one by one, with no arguments." refers to what I'm trying to do, but how I write a list of functions that evaluates to "3" I've no idea.
 Any help appreciated.

 EDIT: I'm sorry that people are upset with me for the way I've set up the poll, I am close to a total newcomer to Linux, and I've just seen these groupings of distros around (usually referring to difficulty/level of customization) so I figured it was a fine enough compromise since I couldn't add them all as poll options. As for why I didn't include various distros like BSDs, as some commenters guessed, I just had never heard of them before.
 Also sorry that it's single choice, it slipped my mind and I can't change it now

 I'm trying to get flyspell to play nice with electric-quote-mode. Basically, especially in org-mode, I want to be able to use 'smart' quotes without each instance of e.g. isn’t being marked as a spelling error.
 Aspell only seems to like straight quotes
 I've looked around the customization options for flyspell but haven't found anything that looks relevant. And it occurred to me that I cannot be the only person dealing with this problem. So I come here asking for help. Anyone?
 (I found a post by Artur Malabarba offering a solution to this problem but I'm wondering if others have other fixes.)

 class PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow :: a -> String instance Pretty a => PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow = show . pretty instance Show a => PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow a = show 
 Now the behavior I want is: if my type is known (at compile-time) to be Show, then use show, but if I know Pretty, then use pretty OVER the show instance (subsequent instances might take further precedence, but I don't need more instances to be possible). The part of resolution order makes sense to me (with some configuration of OVERLAPS/OVERLAPPABLE).
 But I know why I can't write this - the a in the instance definitions match all types! And the instance resolution simply does not use the constraints to resolve the instances. My understanding of the reasoning for this design is that Haskell would become internally inconsistent, because in different contexts, prettyOrShow could have different behavior for the same types in different contexts. Great - I love that - super safe. But in this case I DONT CARE. I want to write this out of convenience - so I don't care about safety here - if the behavior is inconsistent I will still sleep deeply and peacefully . If we had dependent constraints or something similar, perhaps this would be easy - but as it stands - this is not...
 Is there a way to do what I want to do? Make it as grimy as you like. Use reflection if you must but bonus points if its raw GHC Haskell: we will all bask in the ugliness.

How can I predict the projects this year? (Where can I find out some clues?)
 Which materials should I go through to master required basic skills, including reading books, articles (both blogs and papers), open-source project code, and any other resource? I can only finish some 1-3 kyu problems on CodeWars now. (My CodeWars Profile)
 How to write an attractive proposal in GSoC for working with Haskell.org? I can find very few accepted GSoC proposals on the Internet, many of which were even written several years ago. I have almost no idea about how to write the proposal, especially for Haskell.org, can you provide me with some examples for references?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, to understand my problem, let me explain my situation.
 I am Greek and naturally a lot of my files are in greek. To make org export to a latex pdf properly, if it has greek characters, you need to add some packages to it. I have those in my org-latex-packages-alist and everything exports just fine. 
 However, when we get to exporting org-roam files (or any file that contains file links for that matter), there is a problem. The org latex export backend typically exports a link like \href{file_name}{description}. If the file name is in greek (which odds are it is), latex starts to freak out a bit. Org will export perfectly to latex, but latex won't export to pdf. To my understanding, it doesn't understand the greek characters in the file name (which it should as it understands them everywhere else) and it chooses not to export.
 After a lot of searching, I did manage to find a solution to this in this post. Basically, if the link is of the form \href{\detokenize{file_name}}{description}, it exports perfectly. From what I understand, that command just makes it recognize any unicode character for file names. 
 So my question is, can you configure the org latex export backend to export links in the form \href{\detokenize{file_name}}{description} and not \href{file_name}{description} as it does by default. I couldn't find any option that changes how hyperref makes its links in the hyperref manual, nor could I find how org exports its links to latex in the org-export manual, so if anyone here knows, it would help me greatly.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have slowly transitioned from PyCharm to Emacs for my coding development and It's been about 6 months now and in general am very happy with my workflow in Emacs. There is just one thing that is still pulling me back to PyCharm and it is something that others might not find too useful but I constantly use. 
 It is the tree-like structure overview for your code that PyCharm has that you can toggle on the left and it looks like this. 
 Now I know I can get a directory overview with the treemacs package and I also know about the iMenu command which is very nice but not exactly a static tree-like structure you can look at. I was wondering if there exists a package to show the class/functions/ structure of a file on the side as you can see on the picture above. 
 Thank you for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my file looks like this:
 #+title: Hi Reddit #+author: monsieurpi #+OPTIONS: H:3 num:3 toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:{} _:{} *:t TeX:t LaTeX:t * Test #+CAPTION: test #+NAME: fig:test #+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px [[./img/test.jpg]] 
 I tried to export it with C-c C-e m m:
 # Table of Contents 1. [Test](#org358707a) <a id="org358707a"></a> # Test ![img](./img/test.jpg "test") 
 Which is almost perfect but the #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px wasn't exported.
 I then tried with pandoc C-c C-e p g (and in CLI with pandoc -i reddit.org -o reddit.md):
 @:t ::t |:t ^:{} \_:{} \*:t TeX:t LaTeX:t # Test ![](./img/test.jpg) 
 Looks like pandoc doesn't care about my options and even wrote some of them as plain text and the size for my image is still not here.
 Is there a way to achieve it (other than writing 
 #+html: <img src="img/test.jpg" width="600px"> 
 Because I tried:
 * Test #+CAPTION: test #+NAME: fig:test #+PROPERTY: header-args :eval never-export #+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400xp [[./img/test.jpg]] #+html: <img src="img/test.jpg" width="400px"> 
 But the image is still exported.
 And why does pandoc export my options as plain text?

 * Tuesday, 02/15/2022

 This is the start of the next paragraph. I think it would look better if it started such that all text lines up, so "This" would start under the previous paragraphs "Is".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, I've been learning akka, and I'm trying to wrap my head around thread safety. Let's recap
 JAVA THREAD MEMORY MODEL
 All threads have their own little slice of memory exclusive to that thread. Periodically the JVM will sync the thread memory values to main memory, but it's not guaranteed when that will happen. This is why different threads can see different values of a variable.
 Volatile of course bypasses this by making a given variable always be read/written from/to main memory. Synchronized enforced the other piece of this, ensuring that only one thread at a time can interact with it to prevent race conditions.
 AKKA ACTOR THREAD MEMORY MODEL
 So I do not totally understand this, but here is what I do understand. AKKA has its own thread pool, and is purely message based. A given actor is executed on any available thread when a message is present for that actor.
 The first thing that trips me up is that Akka only executes a message on a given actor one at a time. Ie, a given actor will process messages synchronously. I could be wrong about this, please tell me if I am. This just seems like a bad model for concurrency vs a more traditional approach like the thread-per-request model of a traditional webapp like Spring.
 The second thing is that while this kind of message processing rule would prevent race conditions, it feels like memory consistency would still be an issue. If an actor can be operated on by multiple threads, even if those threads can't touch it concurrently, how do all the threads see the same state value? Wouldn't there be a risk of memory consistency issues? Are actors somehow made entirely volatile?
 CONCLUSION
 I clearly do not understand some key stuff here. Guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.

Using Consult's narrowing system, the user is able to access the current project's buffers, project files and all the known projects, in case they want to change projects quickly. Consult-project provides an extension to the default Consult functionality, using the built-in package project.el, defining the functions consult-project and consult-project-other-window. Furthermore, Consult-project only depends on consult, resulting in a lean and simple to maintain functionality.
 ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package consult-projectile by OlMon. Most if not all credit should go to him, I have been using his package for months now. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.
 Also special shutout to Daniel Mendler for making such a great package!
 I would appreciate any feedback, I'll try to submit the package to MELPA next.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /r/Haskell.
 I have two questions, and both of them are about this commit: https://github.com/sekunho/swapi/tree/59277e41bd12b6f390600c78f12742f5da335aea.
 Static binary
 Currently I'm not really aware of exactly what libs I need to build a static binary with cabal build; locally in nix develop. 
  
Output
 Packages in flake.nix
 swoogle's ghc-options in swapi.cabal
  
It does work fine in the CI (I think) since I'm using the ghc-musl image, but I'm not sure how that translates to a Nix environment, unfortunately. Building it with dynamic linking does work though (by removing the ghc-options under the swoogle executable), but I'd like for it to be consistent between CI and the dev environment, for the most part. 
 Discrepancies in CI and dev
  
Dockerfile
 GitHub Actions file
 cabal.project.freeze
 swapi.cabal
  
This has more to do with how cabal resolves the dependencies. So this is the result of the most recent job: (GitHub Actions, PasteBin).
 My question here is, despite freezing the dependencies (and committing it), why does cabal resolve them differently? Locally it all builds, and runs just fine. But in the CI it seems to be complaining about conflicting versions of base, for example. At one point it also complained about req, and some other libraries. I think I'm missing something obvious to make it consistent between both environments. I don't understand where it pulled that new base version from.
 I'll try to provide more information if ever what I've provided so far is insufficient. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
I'm new to zettelkasten. I've been playing with it for just a few days now, and I've already found some of the KMs very helpful.
Thanks, @Will, for many of them!
I was wondering if anyone had ever created a KM for inserting a link to a structure note on a zettel.
For me, I put my links to the structure note and other zettels at the very bottom of each zettel. I've used the naming convention for structure notes that includes the • between the UID and the text title.
I was thinking if there was a way to set it up so it worked something like this:
I place my cursor in the appropriate location in my zettel.
I enter the key combination for the KM to insert my structure note link.
It then gives me a prompt, asking me which structure note I want to link to (it would limit it to those zettels with the • in the title).
I select the appropriate structure note.
It automatically enters that structure note as a link in the format of UID and text title of the structure note.
Is this possible? Is it unnecessary?
The reverse of this would be a time saver too. For me, I often add a link to my newest zettel to my structure note immediately after I create the zettel. So, if there was a way to go back to my structure note and use a KM to create a link to the most recently created zettel (of even a prompt to choose from one of the more recently created zettels) that would save time too.
Or, have you guys found ways to save time and do this without a KM macro?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I am struggling very much with orgmode (vanilla emacs), but I remain a believer ;)
 I want to make a diary/log/journal file (org-capture with datetree should be fine), but...
 I want to be able to browse, but I want to limit editing to a smaller section of the file, similar how I can edit "#begin_src" block using "org-edit-special" in a new frame/window.
 I need this as a psychological effect of saying "now I will change (and only this entry)" and "now I will only view" (I don't need this for every orgmode file, but especially in my journal where any edit to a previous section must be conscious).
 Hit me. What can a beginner do to achieve this? What is available right now?
 EDIT/NOTES: this is not about making a file read-only or about making backups or versioning. It is about the actual process of a human CONFIRMING himself that it wants to change stuff.

 SimpleX Chat for terminal is built in Haskell, and with a lot of help from u/angerman - thank you! - we made the same core work both on iOS and Android platforms.
 To exchange messages privately you can connect either via the invitation link you can share from the app or by scanning QR code from the app on their phone (e.g., during video call or in person).
 More information about SimpleX and iOS app is in this post: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/blog/20220214-simplex-chat-ios-public-beta.md
 We really look forward to your feedback – you can connect to the team from the app settings (it will be myself or somebody else replying to you:)
 Please star the repo on GitHub (thanks a lot if you did already!) and share iOS app beta with your friends – Android app is coming in a few weeks too!

This seems to be a thing lots of people want so I thought I'd share it here. I'm not a programmer, so this code is almost certainly worse than it could be (though I've been helped by looking at lots of other people's code). It works for my use-case and I've done some basic unit-testing, but am happy to hear of things that need fixing.
 https://github.com/mclear-tools/emacs-workspaces
 Note that this doesn't affect one's tab-bar, tab-line, or project.el config in any way. It just adds a few convenience functions to set things up for isolated buffers and for creating or opening workspaces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apparently there is a package called python. It's built-in, and also distributed through GNU ELPA: https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/python.html
 And there is different one called python-mode in MELPA: https://melpa.org/#/python-mode, with upstream at https://gitlab.com/python-mode-devs/python-mode/
 What is the difference between them?
 The background of my question is that I tried to setup my Emacs 27 as a python environment with a language server like David Wilson (aka SystemCrafter) described in his tutorial. This is a codesnippet of it.
 ```lisp (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-l") :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t) )
 (use-package python-mode :ensure t :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred) :custom (python-shell-interpreter "python3") ) ```
 I am not sure but it looks like that the python-mode here cause the use of the MELPA version of python-mode. How can I setup the inbuild python mode of Emacs include the use of the language server?

 I was looking for alternatives to org-mode, not because there is anything wrong with it, but because I use it only for note taking and sometimes TODO and was wondering what else is there.
 Another thing with org is that sometimes the ecosystem, for someone not doing GTD or writing a paper etc. can feel a bit overwhelming. 
 I didn't find a lot of info about howm, except a couple posts here, including a 15 year old link that is dead (thank heavens to the Wayback Machine). But I can infer there are some active users between this subreddit and the Emacs Wiki.
 I like the way it links info with >>> and the schedules with special sorting for TODO vs deadline vs reminder seems interesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
I'm working on some notes and I'm a bit confused on the process I should use.
I have note which is about "Transform information into knowledge" where I talk about the differences between the two.
It comes from the Zettelkasten method, and it gave me ideas on many other subjects, like therapy, coaching and marketing.
I also already have a note that says "It's not about what you know, it's about what you do with what you know", talking about the ideas that knowledge is not enough, and that it's acting on knowledge that builds and create things. That note is also connected to coaching and therapeutic ideas.
I had some epiphanies and good concepts while working on those notes, and that created 2 other notes.
At first, I was writing everything in the first note "Transform information into knowledge" which was becoming almost like the start of an article. The "flow" got to me and I wrote some good ideas and made some good connections.
I'm new to Zettelkasten but I remember the Permanent / Evergreen notes should be atomic and if possible, quite short.
So I splited my "Transform information into knowledge" note into 5 different notes.
I now have 5 different notes, linked together, talking about the same idea.
In a MOC about Therapeutic Changes, I added all those 5 notes.
It's a bit confusing to me because naturally I would have kept "Transform information into knowledge" and let that note because a bit longer and like an "index" of all the others ideas, and put that note into my Therapeutic MOC.
And when I see examples here and there I feel like permanent notes are not "that short" and even sometimes, not that atomic.
What's the best method here in your opinion ? What's your take on this ?
Thanks a lot]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I am a new convert to emacs. I tried in the past to get my head around it for simple plain text editing, but it never really clicked. Recently I got back into it (mainly via vim -> evilmode) and I am currently hacking away on my own config. (The stream series "Emacs from Scratch" by System Crafters was insanely helpful.)
 I am a physics postgrad and use R for data analysis and yihui's suite of R packages for any type of write-up/publishing.
  
RMarkdown: Simple Markdown syntax to write documents with R code blocks mainly to avoid writing LaTeX directly and for reproducibility.
 bookdown: Write scientific reports in RMarkdown and export them to html (Github Pages) and pdf with references and citations.
 blogdown: Publish my personal website via a simple RMarkdown syntax and easy to use R-functions. (Not thaaaat important to me, I don't blog regularly)
  
I have realised that I can do most of those things also using orgmode. Is someone here who made a similar switch from the RMarkdown ecosystem to orgmode, who could point me in the right direction regarding workflows, packages or tutorials etc? I am slowly getting paralysed by the amount of possibilities I have with emacs and now orgmode....
 ​
 edit: I mainly want to switch to emacs with orgmode to get away from RStudio. I feel it can be quite limiting.

 I'm using lsp-mode with intelephense as the back-end. Code completion works great, but I'm missing the usual alerts that I got with PhpStorm which showed, in the method signature, which exceptions where thrown but not catched.
 What do you guys use for that? Should I use another specific tool for it or maybe should I switch to another LSP back-end, ...?
 Thanks a lot in advance!
 EDIT: as a front-end for linting, I'm using the built-in flymake-mode.

 Is there a native way to do that? Am I supposed to use the post-tangle hook org-babel provides?
 For now what I'm doing is:
 - create all src blocks setting the tangle to a file location I can access, like #+begin_src typescript :tangle ~/tmp/this-is-a-test.ts
 - run org-babel-tangle
 - running the compiler on that file manually to find out the results

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had to write a rather big university assignment in Haskell a year ago where a particular pattern emerged in the code. There were multiple situations where we had function call chains that looked like this:
 foo -> bar -> baz -> foo -> bar -> baz etc. etc.
 Baz had some conditional behavior in it that either quit the "loop" or returned back to foo again. In the case of the assignment the data being passed around was data for the solution to a puzzle.
 The code worked, but the more I think about it the sketchier it seems.
 Does this seem appropriate or should it be avoided?

 I think the results section take up too much, and I would like to make this more compact with something like:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp (cl-position 2 '(2 6 7)) #+end_src => 0 
 I have a couple of questions regarding this change:
  
How would I go about making this work? I am pretty new to directly touching the Emacs packages themselves, so not sure how this would look.
 Are there any drawbacks to this approach that I might not have considered?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve recently been assigned an project where I’ve been tasked to create a lexical analyzer with the basis of the main function:
 tokenize :: String -> [(String, Token)]
 and as an arithmetic string as it’s only parameter and without any imported functions (like split)
 I’ve been struggling for the past couple days trying to understand Haskell but having no such luck other than recursion as well as a bit of the split function I made, which I know is used in this project. 
 The output would be something like something like this:
 Input: “(Result * 50) = Answer”
 Output: [(“(“, LeftPar),(“Result”, Id),(“*”, Value 50),(“)”, RightPar),(“=“, Equals),(“Answer”, Id)]
 I still want to learn so I don’t want the straight full answer, but rather a push in the right direction. Especially when it comes to data type declaration which I know comes into to play here. Any help would be appreciated at this point. Please and thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a chunk of hexadecimal digits in a buffer, I want to convert it to raw bytes. I happen to know the raw bytes are going to all be ASCII characters.
 Here is the solution I have so far:
 I start with this:
 74686520717569636b2062726f776e20 666f78206a756d706564206f76657220 746865206c617a7920646f67 
 I run this on the buffer
 (let ((case-replace nil)) (replace-regexp "[[:xdigit:]]\\{2\\}" "\\\\x\\&") (goto-char (point-min)) (replace-regexp "^" "(insert \"") (goto-char (point-min)) (replace-regexp "$" "\")")) 
 That makes the buffer into this:
 "\x74\x68\x65\x20\x71\x75\x69\x63\x6b\x20\x62\x72\x6f\x77\x6e\x20" "\x66\x6f\x78\x20\x6a\x75\x6d\x70\x65\x64\x20\x6f\x76\x65\x72\x20" "\x74\x68\x65\x20\x6c\x61\x7a\x79\x20\x64\x6f\x67" 
 Now I make it into a Lisp expression:
 (goto-char (point-min)) (insert "(insert\n") (goto-char (point-max)) (insert ")") 
 Now my buffer has this:
 (insert "\x74\x68\x65\x20\x71\x75\x69\x63\x6b\x20\x62\x72\x6f\x77\x6e\x20" "\x66\x6f\x78\x20\x6a\x75\x6d\x70\x65\x64\x20\x6f\x76\x65\x72\x20" "\x74\x68\x65\x20\x6c\x61\x7a\x79\x20\x64\x6f\x67") 
 Finally I do this:
 (eval (read (prog1 (buffer-string) (erase-buffer)))) 
 and I get the result I want
 the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog 
 Is there a better way to do this? It would especially be nice to do this without (eval (read (buffer-string))). Note that this function needs to run on arbitrary length string inputs scattered throughout a buffer, but mostly operate on only 2-8 bytes of hexadecimal encoded data at a time, so something that works efficiently on small strings is best.
 Thanks!

So far, I'm loving Scala - seems like a really powerful language and I'm glad that I have the time to learn it.
 However, I've made a simple test in each language to truly compare the speed of each language when running a large loop, and I'm finding that JavaScript is actually much faster than Scala in that regard.

 This is a minor mode that can do well with LaTeX or org-mode. 
 What it does is: convert valid lisp expressions to LaTeX expressions. As you know we can evaluate lisp expressions directly in emacs (C-x C-e), so I had this thought why not use emacs as a calculator while typing the text without the need to move to another buffer to calculate things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HI, I cannot find on the internet ways to be faster on using org mode to move items between files, I am doing some hacks but I know that there have to be a faster way, to optimize such a repetitive task.
 Intuitively I opened two vertical windows, so that i have in window 1 a file A.org in a buffer, and in window 2 a file B.org in antoher buffer
 What i cut in a file is not pasted as I would expect in the second bufffer:
 1) Selecting ONE heading with relative subheadings, or selecting subheading in windows 1 cutting and pasting in window 2 at a different level of nested level, is painful, because the two files have different level of indentation(I mean number of asterisks). So for example if I have in window 1 a block of text that is at a third level, when I am going to paste in window 2 `at a specific point` at a 5th level, is `not` going to be recognized that need to be pasted "under" the 5th level and so be recognized as a 6th level the heading(from window 1) and at a 7th level the relative subheading. 
 I would rather select multiple files in window 1 and paste in window 2:
 2) I would like to select multiple headings, or subheadings in window 1 an then just paste them in window 2, so far I have been able only to do it one per time, instead I was expecting to cut in window 1 all the text I needed and then paste all in window2 (I mean like when I am using a resource browser on a PC and I select with control click all the items i need(not consequential) and then paste on a certain point in window 2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy. So I have worked with Scala before but quite a few years ago. It was my big introduction to functional programming and by the end of the project I understood functional programming just well enough to be interested in it. Since then I have studied it extensively in languages that are not purely functional, mainly TypeScript, and this has motivated me to pick up Scala again.
 I know that Scala 3 has just come out. Obviously I would like to work with the latest version. However my experience with other major software updates leaves me a bit wary. I have seen in other ecosystems major updates causing widespread compatibility issues with common libraries resulting in a highly complicated process of figuring out what will and will not work with the new version.
 On that note, I'm hoping for clarity on a few points:
 1) does scala 2 code compile in a scala 3 project?
 2) will third party libraries written for scala 2 still be compatible with Scala 3? I'm inclined to say yes because it all compiles to Java bytecode but I just want to be sure.
 3) any other pitfalls that someone with limited scala experience who will be starting with Scala 3 should know?
 Thanks in advance.

 My output:

 I understand how my answer is incorrect, I am just at a loss on how to go about fixing it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, similar question to https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/it9vw3/centaurtabs_and_perspmode/
 I just want to be able to have tabs that I can reorganize amongst themselves (I couldn't figure out how to do that with native emacs tabs), and workgroups (e.g: perspective/workgroups/persp-mode/...) to be able to switch from a set of tabs to another set of tabs.
 Currently I have centaur-tabs setup because it's the only tab solution that allows me to move tabs (eg: centaur-tabs-move-current-tab-to-left, centaur-tabs-move-current-tab-to-right), but it doesn't play nice with any workgroup packages. Tabs stay visible in all workgroups with perspective
 Has anyone been able to achieve this?

So my question is since I have used Laravel framework before, does Haskell have some tools/frameworks for start ups that abstracts the background work into easy to do steps to set up for example authentication, Database, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In several projects, I've needed a way to implement remote procedure calls. What do people use for this, or is this something that's mostly missing in the community? Hackage has a variety of libraries but they're either very old or seemingly unmaintained. The only one I see that's maintained is grpc-haskell.
 Anyway, grpc-haskell uses proto3-wire instead of proto-lens (which the community seems to have settled on as the best solution). This leads to its own confusion.
 I could use something like warp + servant (or warp + wai to reinvent the wheel), but servant is missing some major functionality for this purpose. Namely, servant is focused on REST, which means the transfer of an entire object state. One of the things I want from an RPC system is the ability to stream data in a type-safe manner (like gRPC does). 
 Any thoughts? I'd prefer something standardized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a very new newbie. The pdf (https://orgmode.org/orgguide.pdf) already explained tab cycling in two sections back, "2.2 Visibility Cycling", and I understand that. But then under "2.4 Structure Editing" they indicate this key binding:
  
"TAB in new empty entry: In a new entry with no text yet, TAB cycles through reasonable levels." 
  
Is that different than the normal tab cycling? I can't find that TAB does anything different anywhere, other than normal cycling to me, but maybe I don't understand the context ("in a new entry with no text") or my org file is still too simple to demonstrate this function?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write an implementation of the tabu search algorithm. Basically local search with a tabu list of recently visited states.
 To do this I need to mess around with parts of Haskell I have never touched before. Type classes.
 I want to generalise the algorithm to the point that the data that the algorithm operates on is completely invisible to the algorithm itself. Like a java interface I want something I can attach to an object type and say "this object is now compatible with this search algorithm".
 class TabuSt a where evaluate:: a -> Int type ST = (Int, [Int]) instance TabuSt ST where evaluate x = 0 
 That's a toy implementation. I define the type class TabuSt. I define a type alias ST. And I define the instance of the type class. I also define a function evaluate that takes a state and returns an integer evaluation of the state. Note that it does not compile.
 This is the error message "tabu.hs:12:10: error: • Illegal instance declaration for ‘TabuSt ST’ (All instance types must be of the form (T t1 ... tn) where T is not a synonym. Use TypeSynonymInstances if you want to disable this.) • In the instance declaration for ‘TabuSt ST’"
 Why does this not work?

automatically adds paragraph indents to new lines when I press Enter but doesn't indent the entire text block (like in Scrivener, word, etc.)
 Formats it nicely like a fiction novel when I export it to pdf
  
I would like it to look like Composition mode in Scrivener or in Manuskript (I tried Manuskript but found it very slow, so I moved over to Emacs). I've tried almost every built-in paragraph/indent mode, Olivetti, and Writeroom Mode, but none of them seem to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I'm new here and to emacs, so sorry if I'm asking a repeated question or something just not acceptable for some reason.
 I've used vim for many years and then neovim for about two years. I am/was very happy with neovim's current state of plugins, ecosystem, lua configuration and vi's philosophy on editing text.
 However I've reached a point where I 
 A) have become very interested in lisp languages and
 B) realized that I would like a much more flexible and complete computing environment that goes beyond my text editor. 
 Funnily enough this problem was solved many years ago by the dark side (just a joke 🤣). So I'm pretty excited to dive into Emacs, learn all about it and I know today its exactly the tool Id like for the rest of my computing career.
 I wanted to ask however to other emacs users, especially ex-Vimmers if readily slapping evil on emacs to make myself comfortable (at least on the text editing side) can hinder me from learning all the ins and outs of emacs?
 I have grown very accustomed to vim's text editing experience. Its so precise and short. I'm very used to changing text with up to 3 or 4 keystrokes to a precision that is very hard to get out of. I mean this in the best of ways, I really like Emacs and am having a lot of fun learning it. I'm just asking to better understand how I should go about this. I'd imagine that the text editing part is such a minor attribute of the power of Emacs and what its capable of that maybe it wouldn't make a difference how one chooses to edit text.
 Thanks in advance 👍

 The first section contains the info nodes and help corresponding to the examples.
 The second section shows 10 "basic" examples using lexical-binding, lambda, defun, let, lexical-let, setq and defvar.
 And the third section shows a more advanced example using lambda, let, dolist and defun.
 Have a nice day,

 Given the attention effect systems have had, I thought I'd convert a monomorphic transformer stack into an MTL-style effect and but ran into the following issue, likely due to my effect becoming polymorphic, the related recursive helper type class Fun became polymorphic and stopped working.. 
 The issue (same as on SO):
 I'd like to use literal haskell functions in a dsl as follows:
 haskell program :: forall m . DSL m => m () program = do stm $ Stm (Var "a") -- this way: f <- fun $ \(a :: Expr a) (b :: Expr b) -> do -- function body is of the same monad `m` as the one in top level stm $ Stm (Var "b") stm $ Stm $ Apply f (Var "c") pure () 
 .. and turn the above into code ([Stm]).

You can find my conf here:https://github.com/sganon/emacs/blob/main/init.el
 If you know what I'm doing wrong or any step that can help me debug this problem that would be awesome.
 Thanks.

 EDIT: I've found that indeed there is a conflict between lsp-eslint-apply-all-fixes and lsp-format-buffer but I'm not sure why yet

 I'm using Emacs-IPython-Notebook with Elpy. It was a struggle to find the right documentation to get an initial setup up and running, but, I finally got these tools working, and I'm very happy now that I can develop Jupyter Notebooks in Emacs.
 Anyways, my question has to do with being able to run Python/JavaScript Widgets in Emacs, specifically in Emacs-IPython-Notebook(and emacs-jupyter as well). I did try last year to run pywidgets in EIN, but it did not work. Anyways, I was reading a article in r/emacs a while back(I can't find it anymore, lol) about Emacs now being able run browser widgets. So that'd be great to get that working, so that I can run browser Widgets in Emacs.
 Could any of you enlighten me on this issue?
 Thanks in advance for the help.

I'm new on the forum but been reading the articles and the forum since I discovered ZK not long ago. I love it and it already changed my life and the way I work and the way I see what I do. I find the philosophy of it life changing.
Anyway, I have a question I can't find the answer too.
Quite some times I read articles that provide a step by step for something, and acronym immediately useful. I don't see how I can "put it in my own words". I could but I feel like it's spending time on stuff I really do understand and use. It's more like reminders of processes than "knowledge". The subject fits already into my train of thoughts and the stuff I'm working on.
What do you do with that kind of notes ? Do they go into the permanent folder ? Do they stay as some kind of literature notes ? How one would find those reminders / process / short tips in a ZK ?
Thanks]]></summary>

 Hi! I upgraded to org-roam v2 about two months ago after using v1 for a few months before that. I felt org-roam-server quite useful primarily for visualizing which ideas link to which others. However, I haven't felt the same introauitiveness with org-roam-ui (the server counterpart for v2). And the graph always seems too cluttered and rather difficult to use for purposes of idea-link visualization. Has anyone else felt this? Is it just a matter of getting used to?
 PS: org-roam-ui certainly is useful for checking nodes and obtaining a visually appealing overview of the personal knowledge base. But something feels off. I wonder if it is related to different coloring algorithms, wherein org-roam-server seems to color "daughter" nodes close to the parent node, especially if the parent node is a "hub", whereas org-roam-ui seems to use no such heuristic. Just a guess!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using Manjaro Cinnamon.
 So a few weeks ago, I built Emacs with support for background-only transparency (it's awesome btw). The build was a little buggy, but after building, I decided to install it using 'make install' - having followed some comments on this sub and elsewhere that the side-by-side install would work, since the default directory would be my 'local', separate to where Arch puts pacman packages (where my normal Emacs is) - for safety I used the prefix option and called it 'TRANemacs'.
 But the background-only transparency emacs remained a bit buggy so I decided to uninstall using 'make uninstall'. Upon running my normal emacs, everything seemed to work normally except that the Cinnamon task bar shows an empty icon where the Emacs logo should be. Further digging shows that emacs has a logo, but emacs-client (which I guess is what gets started) doesn't. I reinstalled emacs with pacman but there is no change.
 Further to that, worth noting that it seems like 'make uninstall' did not cleanly remove everything related to TRANemacs, but I don't think the files left behind (e.g. the site-lisp folder) are very important.
 I'm not great at solving this sort of problem. Might anyone know how can I return the logo to emacs? And how do I prevent multiple emacs installations from clobbering each other in future?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 ​
 I have a number of latex export classes defined in my init file like so:
 ``` (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes '("my-landscape" "\input{/home/user/.config/emacs/tex/class-my-landscape.tex} [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES] " ("\section{%s}" . "\section{%s}") ("\subsection{%s}" . "\subsection{%s}")))
 ``` As you can see, I include another tex file as a preamble and that works quite well.
 However, I would like to get to work on a landscape A4 multiple column class and for this it is suggested one uses \usepackage{multicols} in the preamble, easy enough added to the .tex file. 
 And here is where it gets tricky, one needs to add the line \begin{multicols}{3} after \begin{document} and \end{multicols*} before \end\document}. This is proving to be not trivial to set up for me.
 Does anybody have tips and or suggestions on how to tackle this issue ?
 thx S

This correspondence is known as the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence and relates:
  
Haskell types with objects of the category
 
Terms of type A→B with morphisms f:A→B (note the similar notations)
 
Algebraic datatypes with initial objects
 
Type constructors with functors
 
etc
 
  
What are algebraic datatypes in Haskell? (I thought all types, including those types defined by datatype, newtype, or type, and/or those types provided by the language and by the standard library modules, are algebraic datatypes. So I think I was wrong.)
 Is the concept "abstract datatype" the same to all the programming languages?
 How are algebraic datatypes related with initial objects?
 Thanks.

 I have been struggling for a few days to figure out how to do this. The majority of resources for Alex / Happy seem to be very outdated, but I've had the most luck with this one: https://github.com/jmoy/alexhappy/blob/master/whitespace/Lexer.x
 It seems to target an old version of Alex though, as when building I get a bunch of compiler errors.
 Here is my code: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/yn3JWSrhAnd these are the errors I get: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/fTZhuGeTAlex version 3.2.6
 Also, when writing monadic parsers / lexers, should I still use the monad wrapper if I define my own monad type?
 Any help appreciated

An invisible character adds confusion and ambiguity. To me a better solution would be more explicit, perhaps a single-line comment character like the # of python.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It doesn't exist yet, lol. But it's an idea I just had. I don't have the skill to do anything like this, but maybe someone else (or a group of people) do. It would contain music maybe starting slow and crescendoing throughout the commercial. Short scenes of individuals doing crazy complicated physical, artful, skillful /r/nextlevel kind of stuff, interspersed with crazy text on a screen moving around (typical org mode stuff, LaTeX editing, etc.), matrix looking stuff, more individuals performing high precision things, etc. Building up, and then ending with a finale and "Emacs" with logo on the screen. Fade to black. 
 I've read a few posts here and there about the need to get more people into Emacs. They usually focus on "how to change emacs to appeal to a wider audience". I'm not going to touch that subject, but simple marketing can be powerful. When I search google for "Emacs Commercial" I get a grand total of 20 results (none of which is a commercial). Youtube returns zero.
 Surely there's some skillful people out there, passionate about Emacs, who would also like to work on or collaborate on a few commercials? I could see another commercial that has testimonials from people.
 FYI, I'm an emacs newbie, and am excited about learning it. Apologies in advance if this isn't a good idea or if this kind of post doesn't belong here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I often need to act with Embark not on the symbol or plain value, but rather on the result of its evaluation. For example I'd like to be able to open the value of user-emacs-directory by using embark-act on this symbol. Is there some trick I've missed?
 I tried using M-: after embark-act as it could work as a workaround, but I didn't find a way to make it ask me to edit the resulting expression either.
 Could someone nudge me in the right direction? An info how to force embark to show me an interactive prompt for some commands (like it already does OOTB for some) would be a nice bonus.
 EDIT: It seems the latter is possible by customizing embark-target-injection-hooks (link). I correctly remembered there was a variable directly controlling this behavior but it was removed since then, hence why I couldn't find it anymore.

 The org file SRD
 The dnd-mode
 The documentation in these is lacking still, but I plan on adding more information about usage. Until then, if anyone would like to try it out they are welcome to ask questions to get up and running. Right now the mode has a dependency on 'org-mode' and 'yasnippet'. It is also expecting that the repos be cloned to your '~' directory by default (you can change it if you want).
 I do not currently have an examaple of a campaign, because I only have paid for campaigns setup for my personal. If anyone wants to provide a small campaign they made I would add it as an example, I sadly don't have one at the ready right now, however. 
 Again, I am happy to answer questions if anyone wants to try it.

 It seems that if you want Org to parse the date you type you cannot interact with the calendar pop up at all, which I find a little frustrating. Is there an easy way to tell Org "forget I scrolled the calendar a bit, use the date I'm typing?".

In this post I present an alternative approach to combinator-based implementation of functional languages that is significantly faster than classical graph-reduction based solutions.
Every Distributive is Representable by Daniel Mlot

 Here is the list
  progLanguages = [ ("CptS121" , ["C"]), ("CptS122" , ["C++"]), ("CptS223" , ["C++"]), ("CptS233" , ["Java"]), ("CptS321" , ["C#"]), ("CptS322" , ["Python", "JavaScript"]), ("CptS355" , ["Haskell", "Python", "PostScript", "Java"]), ("CptS360" , ["C"]), ("CptS370" , ["Java"]), ("CptS315" , ["Python"]), ("CptS411" , ["C", "C++"]), ("CptS451" , ["Python", "C#", "SQL"]), ("CptS475" , ["Python", "R"]) ] 
 It needs to be compatible with the following
  The type of the max_count function should be compatible with one of the following: max_count :: [(a1, [a2])] -> (a1, Int) max_count :: Foldable t => [(a1, t a2)] -> (a1, Int) 
 So far, I have attempted the following code
  max_count [] = error "bad" max_count [x] = x max_count (x:xs) = x max_helper (max_count xs) where max_helper (a,b) (a',b') | length b > length b' = (a, length b) | otherwise = (a', length b') 
 This has not worked in the slightest, and I am at a blank for what to do. Any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched to an M1 Pro machine and decided to give Nix a try. I'm using Home Manager and nix-darwin, and having trouble figuring out the idiomatic way to set up a development environment.
 What I used to have
  
Intel Mac
 Stack installed with Homebrew, using managed GHC 8.10.3 (Stackage LTS 17.2)
 haskell-language-server installed manually, integrated with Neovim through ALE
  
What I want
 I am trying to minimize reliance on Rosetta, since I've read nasty things happen when combining x86 and ARM toolchains. As a result, I’d like to upgrade my project to GHC 8.10.7 to take advantage of the ARM-native binary. Eventually, I'd like to migrate this project to Cabal, because HLS and Stack don't play well together in test files.
 I'd also like to start new projects using GHC 9.2.1 to …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ormolu project, led by Mark Karpov at Tweag, has been providing a reliable way to format Haskell source files for a few years now. It makes use of the parser of GHC itself, so as to prevent parsing issues that unfortunately some other Haskell formatters have.
Alexander Esgen detailed several improvements he made to Ormolu during his internship in a previous blog post. In turn, this blog post will be focusing on the challenge of formatting infix operator chains in Haskell, which is notoriously difficult and has been my primary goal for the last two months.

Operator chains
Almost all programming languages allow the use of infix operators, especially for the four basic numeric operators, +, -, * and /. Moreover, most of the time, these operators can be “chained” together without parenthe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATED: I have modified the example to remove any dependency on external packages.
 I must be misunderstanding something quite basic here, so I'll ask this question in the hopes that someone can spot the error. I may have to dig deeper otherwise, but I'm somehow thinking the issue is fairly superficial and I'm just not seeing it. 
 Consider the following function: 
  (defun my/test-let-fun () (interactive) (let* ((var "Hello")) (print var) (if (bound-and-true-p var) (print "Yes.") (print "No.")))) 
 I add this to my config, and the following happens when I call the function.
  
In the minibuffer, I see "Hello." followed by "No."
  
What I take from this is that (bound-and-true-p var) must be returning nil, since otherwise I should see "Yes." So, I conclude: 
  
The variable var must either be unbound or have a nil value during the evaluation of the body of the let* expression.
 The variable var is bound to a non-nil value, since otherwise, I couldn't get something other than nil as the output of (print var).
  
But these two things cannot be true together!
 Am I misinterpreting what's going on? 
 If I am not, how can this be? Is there some other way to check if the value of a variable is non-nil? 
 Puzzlingly, if I define the function after starting Emacs (by calling eval-last-sexp, say), it works as I expect. (I see "Hello" followed by "Yes.")

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I would appreciate advice about the following. I am currently using Embark, Consult, Orderless (and Marginalia).
 Desired action: I have a current buffer open that is 'A'. I want to switch to a different buffer 'B' (which may be anywhere), but I actually want to search buffer B and maybe copy some results over to the current buffer. This could be using consult-line or occur.
 How I am going about the above: 
  
switch buffer (consult-buffer) 
 
Hit embark-act on the desired buffer (bound to C-. as default)
 
Choose either C-s (embark-isearch) or C and l for consult-line 
 
However - the search chosen above always takes place on the current buffer A. I want to act on Buffer B that I chose in the minibuffer.
 
 My config for these packages is pretty vanilla, mostly borrowed off the README's of these packages with some functions stolen from the authors of the packages.

The latter is a function of the fact that I sometimes work in (Windows) environments where emacs will seemingly not work under the proxy no matter what I try. That's fine, in those environments I don't really need emacs connecting to the internet.
 But then, what package strategy to use? The only one that seems to somewhat fit the bill is Borg: however,
  
It uses submodules, and I reaaaaally don't want submodules. I'd much rather use subtrees to commit in particular packages.
 There is no dependency management via this route whatsoever. I've played around with epkg, but there doesn't seem to be a particularly good way of managing dependencies-of-dependencies, unless I'm missing something obvious?
  
Does anyone else have a subtree leveraging workflow and have a relatively sane way of figuring out package dependencies?

The idea behind the fork is to enable a way to submit and incorporate suggestions for edits and updates for LYAH from the community as Haskell evolves and changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure this has been answered a thousand times but I'm not easily finding the answer. 
 I just want to be able to look at my org-mode files from my phone or tablet. I don't, right now, need to sync my agenda or anything like that -- mostly I just want to check my class notes and syllabus before I start reading to prep for lecture or seminar. 
 All my work files are synced via dropbox, so ideally it would be just a simple file reader that I can set so that org files "open with" that app from the dropbox app. Orgzly doesn't seem to be able to do that, though it's true that I can sync specific dropbox folders and access them from there. But mostly I'm going to be clicking on links, etc, rather than editing, and orgzly isn't ideal for that. 
 So: anyone have a good solution? Thanks!

 I do some writing, and while my emacs WINDOW is full screen (I use a tiling window manager) I want the text to wrap at a given column, but only visually; I don't want actual linefeeds there.
 Not even sure what to search for. I want something like 'visual-line-mode' that respects the fill-column value.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted to take a moment to appreciate all that is Org-mode. I was a longtime vim user. My only emacs experience was an assembly course that I took many many years back that for some reason required it. Just over a year ago, I think, I started making a move to using org-mode for my to do lists. I started using templates and creating journal entries all in org. Then I moved into using org-roam for my notes at work and that morphed into using org-dailies and time tracking. With org-mode, I started moving all my ideas and things I wanted to remember, lists of books I'm reading or want to read. It goes on and on and it's all organized in one nice neat (well, a little messy but relatively neat) little package. 
 Just wanted to share my appreciation for org-mode (and org-roam!) and for the community!

I'm lately getting ^M characters before the line feed whenever I paste (that is, yank) from certain applications. I especially notice gnome-terminal, and pdf text content copied from evince. Google suggests it's a text encoding issue, but I created a new buffer, confirmed that buffer-file-coding-system is set to utf-8-unix, and also checked that gnome-terminal encoding is set to utf-8 (don't know how to check in evince).The problem still persists. Yank is of course written in C so I can't run edebug on it, and anyway I wouldn't really know what to look for. 
  
Any suggestions for how to track this down? It is relatively new, but I am not sure *exactly* how long it's been going on.
 If I can't fix it, shouldn't I be able to somehow filter the text in the kill-ring so that the "M" characters are removed before being inserted?
  
Thanks everyone!

 I want to search the full text of the files for all the terms of the input (terms separated by spaces), no matter where in the file they are or in what order. 
 So, if I search for "apple banana", I want to find a file where "banana" is on line 1 and "apple" is on line 15. Since pretty much all search tools are line-oriented and/or keep the order of the terms and/or use 'OR' matching instead of 'AND' matching, I came up with a way to do what I want via a series of pipes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My working method is similar to what @pgrhowarth has described here: In short, I always have to refer back to the original sources, in addition to my own ideas and conclusions. And this is not a personal choice, but a requirement of my profession.  But the "output" of a Zettelkasten, as far as I understand it, is a chain of associations of my own ideas, not some kind of source Wiki.
But I need both and more: on the one hand, I need to relate my sources to each other, i.e. "who quoted whom", "who learned from whom", "who wrote letters with whom", etc and all based on the originals. On the other hand, I want to process my ideas and thoughts on quotations, excerpts, themes, etc. in a Zettelkasten. But beyond that, I need to make sure that my Zettel always refer to the sources from which they are inspired.
The question I have is: what is the best way to do this? Do I need two "boxes", one for the verbatim quotes with sources and a proper Zettelkasten for my ideas? If so, how do I connect the two boxes? Or should I do "double bookkeeping" and always write the original quote and source on each Zettel?
To reiterate: I know how a wiki works, and I think I also know how to set up a Zettelkasten; what is not yet clear to me is how to connect these two systems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently develop a little tool in which I would like to provide a temporarily visible help buffer containing cheat-sheet like content. And that content might be actually huge, so the user should be able to navigate the buffer.
 I plan to provide user options how and where that cheat-sheet might be shown (own frame, single windows with restoring current-window-configuration after close, side window left, right, top, bottom). My personal preference would be to open a new bottom window, as which-key does this for keybindings.
 The cheat-sheet mode would org, probably with a minor mode so that it is read only and can be closed with a single keystroke. I even think about using org-view-mode...
 Now my question is, what would be the best way to create and place the buffer? Shall I do it manually using basically split-window? Or is there something usable, probably the *Help*-buffers functionality as an official api? Or is it better to just create and show the buffer and let the user configure how to place it via display-buffer-alist?

 this starts the spell checking as expected, and that works too. however, for source code buffers, i would like to run spell checker on comments only and not on the code itself. how do i do that ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just started learning emacs (macport) about 10 days ago, Avy is the first package I've installed. So I have some questions.
 FIRST QUESTION Was there a particular reason for Oleh Krehel to suggest binding avy-goto-char to C-: instead of C-;? Since C-; doesn't require the shift key, that would be seem to be a preferred binding for frequent navigation. (Perhaps colon C-; conflicts with some other popular binding?)
 SECOND ISSUE He suggests (from https://github.com/abo-abo/avy) possibly setting up default bindings using 
  
(avy-setup-default) 
  
But that doesn't seem to work for me. C-h b C-x o C-s avy fails to find anything.
 THIRD ISSUE [EDIT: ISSUE RESOLVED, THIS IS USED TO INTEGRATE AVY WITHIN AN ISEARCH.] Here's a snippet from the documentation, I don't understand this:
  
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-j") 'avy-resume)
 It will bind, for example, avy-isearch to C-' in isearch-mode-map, so that you can select one of the currently visible isearch candidates using avy.
  
How does binding to C-c C-j do anything to C-'? And what is isearch-mode-map? That function doesn't seem to exist in my beginner level emacs. What does avy-resume do? I don't understand any of this.
 FYI This is what I finally put into my .init.el file to get Avy to work:
 ;;; AVY BINDINGS https://github.com/abo-abo/avy ;; doesn't seem to work ;;(avy-setup-default) ;; not sure what this does ;;(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-j") 'avy-resume) ;; Suggested bindings from avy github docs (global-set-key (kbd "C-:") 'avy-goto-char) (global-set-key (kbd "C-'") 'avy-goto-char-2) (global-set-key (kbd "M-g f") 'avy-goto-line) (global-set-key (kbd "M-g w") 'avy-goto-word-1) (global-set-key (kbd "M-g e") 'avy-goto-word-0)

 I want to do this in both latex and org buffers, which use two different functions/features for this (preview-latex and org-latex-preview). If using dvipng (as opposed to to the dvisvgm method) I'm not looking to regenerate the previews at the new size, it's OK if it stretches out the images when increasing the text scale.

I try recall my memory, but I couldn't remember how to implement that because I am not familiar with FP concepts. The part that I can remember ​ case class Node[T](v: T, left: Option[Node[T]]=None, right: Option[Node[T]]=Node) { def map[R](f: T => R): R = f(v) def flatten = ... // flatten def flatMap = ... // which combines map and flatten } But I can't remember the part about flatten (the problem I suppose is I don't know what I want to flatten for that ⠀Node object), and then flatMap. Any hint or suggestions on this? I suppose this can help me learn a lesson by implementing the code. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: I'm fairly new to Haskell, I can use the language but I am very unfamiliar with the overall build tooling. I largely just use what is recommended in my work project.
 So I got a new M1Pro. I'm the second on my team to do so. They were able to build everything just fine after some minor adjustments, but I have had problem after problem... and I'm stumped, so I'm turning to you for help.
 The project I'm trying to build is open source (https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli). When I got this new system set up, I ran the instructions on our HACKING.md page and immediately tried to build. This failed because I didn't have llvm installed, so I brew install llvm'd, symlinked into $PATH, and tried again. This failed due to:
 install_name_tool: error: unsupported load command (cmd=0x80000034) `install_name_tool' failed in phase `Install Name Tool'. (Exit code: 1) 
 My teammate who has the M1 already and I compared notes, and he found that he had installed llvm@12. So I removed llvm and its $PATH symlink, installed llvm@12, installed its symlink, and now it compiles! Yay!
 ... But I can't link. I'm now failing on this:
 Building library for byteorder-1.0.4.. [1 of 1] Compiling System.ByteOrder ( System/ByteOrder.hs, dist/build/System/ByteOrder.o, dist/build/System/ByteOrder.dyn_o ) ar: @/dist/build/objs-29886/ar29886-2.rsp: No such file or directory 
 We found a post where someone had a similar issue (here), but the fix in that issue doesn't help: using ar from binutils causes link errors like this instead:
 Linking dist/build/hspec-discover/hspec-discover ... ld: warning: ignoring file /Users/kit/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/hspc-dscvr-2.8.5-ab243a40/lib/libHShspc-dscvr-2.8.5-ab243a40.a, building for macOS-arm64 but attempting to link with file built for macOS-arm64 
 So I'm kinda lost at this point and hoping someone has tips. If you read this far, thanks for your time!

Does it mean that an instance of Monad is also an instance of Applicative? I was wondering how to see an instance of Monad is an instance of Applicative? Can <*> of Applicative be rewritten in terms of >>= and return of Monad?
 
Is an instance of Monad also an instance of Functor? Can fmap of Functor be rewritten in terms of >>= and return of Monad?
 
 Thanks.

Now I want to link the Emacs to .txt so that when I click on the txt file, Emacs (of WLS2) will open it for me. I know another option is to install Emacs for windows, but it's very slow. I would like to use a method to open windows files using Emacs in WSL2. Thanks guys!

 Although most posts about "cabal hell" seem to be almost a decade old I can't really find if anything has changed to abolish it. The closest I've read is someone somewhere mentioning Nix as an alternative to Cabal; is that Nix as in NixOS? Are people really using a system package manager to manage their Haskell packages, or have I completely missed the point? Separate from Nix, is Cabal good now or should I stay away?

 Question regarding where to place (package-refresh-contents)
  
 (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package) 
 (package-refresh-contents) 
 (package-install 'use-package))
  
currently i have this... but in this, (package-refresh-contents) will basically only ran once EVER - during the initial setup, since that's the only time the system will not have use-package installed. should i perhaps place that line before (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)? so that it is run everytime when i start up emacs? there's pros and cons to this right? the pro is that, the package cache/info will be up to date everytime and i can just install packages right away through the commands as the package repos will be all up to date already... the cons is that, i doing so, it will dramatically slow down the startup time 'cuz emacs will spend a lot of time updating the package cache right? and this is probably not worth it since we typically want to run package-list-package interactively anyway when we want to look for packages interactively and it will update the cache at that time anyway

 I thought before I set myself into the indentation rabbit hole, maybe someone knows a package or a sipmle setting to set. Up to now I have been using from time to time haskell-indentation-mode but sometimes it screws some other indentation in the relevant programming language and I would really only "need it" for some comma separated special cases.

 Then I tried to test it in scratch buffer, but could not verify that. defvar always sets the value no matter what. 
 Did some googling, found some stackover flow answers stating the same. 
 Got quite confused for quite some time. 
 Then decided to read elisp mannal, found this: 
  When you evaluate a top-level ‘defvar’ form with ‘C-M-x’ (‘eval-defun’) or with ‘C-x C-e’ (‘eval-last-sexp’) in Emacs Lisp mode, a special feature of these two commands arranges to set the variable unconditionally, without testing whether its value is void. 
 relieved. Isn't this a bit strange? That it doesn't work the same way when you want to test it out by C-x C-e

It's a Snake game written in ScalaJS using a pull-based Functional Reactive Programming. The end result is complicated, but I think it has some interesting properties. Please take a look at the code and my small article. Interested to know what you think! Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started playing more DnD and convinced a co-worker to join me in both that and emacs. As a result of this I thought it would be fun to try to create a robust and interactive DnD environment inside of emacs.
 I have been working on my environment for a about three weeks now and have come up with a pretty good org file character sheet layout that uses table formulas to auto calculate everything based of the abilities that are defined.
 I have also been creating function to toggle my session target (a campaign or a character) to switch where my org-agenda and org-captures point so that I can leverage the searching and quick note taking that those provide.
 In addition to that I have been converting the SRD docs that I can find into ORG files that I can also search via org-agenda. Leveraging tags and properties to create queryable resources.
 ​
 I plan on creating a demo of this environment and sharing it, but that will require a decent amount of work. So, I was wondering what the interest would be in this crossover tool, or if people have solutions that they have developed for this.
 ​
 EDIT 1: Screen Capture of Character Creation
 ​
 Sorry, I noticed i missed the mini-buffer on the recording. The only relevant part was the dice roll at the end though for it. I also forgot to show the proficiency bonus column adds the PB as well. 
 ​
 EDIT 2: Searching the org file SRDs
 Sorry for the little windows. The tool I'm using for recording doesn't give me many pixels :|

You should replace the system-name values with what you get when you evaluate (system-name) in your copy of Emacs. 
  
Whats the best way to do that? Use C-h v? Is there another way? 
 Regardless, one thing I'd like to be able to do (just to know if it's possible) is highlight that web text, copy to the MacOS cut-and-past buffer, then in emacs, C-h v and it prompts me Describe Variable:. Is there a way to just paste/yank the name at that point? C-y didn't work before, but now it does, so this use-case is solved.
 In another use-case, suppose I might have the variable name in my emacs buffer/window, with point on the variable name. Is there a way to "send" what's under the point to C-h v for quick inspection?
 Or another way to "evaluate" the variable so that I can see what it is?
 I'm currently using Ido, if that matters. I'm also very new to emacs!

 Anyway, there you have it. Yet another Emacs minor mode https://github.com/ir33k/fringe-hide

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a program to find the nth prime number between 1 and 100,005, using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For example, the first prime number is 1, the second is 2, and the third is 3.
 Here's my program:
 -- Get a range of list of numbers from begin to end, inclusive.range :: Integer -> Integer -> [Integer]range begin end | end == 0 = [begin] | begin >= end = [end] | otherwise = begin : range (begin + 1) endcheckNotMultiple :: Integral a => a -> a -> BoolcheckNotMultiple a b = r > 0 || q < 2where (q, r) = divMod b aeliminateMultiplesOfP :: Integral a => [a] -> a -> [a]eliminateMultiplesOfP list p = filter (checkNotMultiple p) listeliminateMultiples :: Integral a1 => [a1] -> [a1]eliminateMultiples list | length list > 1 = head list : eliminateMultiples (eliminateMultiplesOfP (tail list) (head list)) | otherwise = list-- Sieve of EratosthenesgetNthPrime :: Int -> IntegergetNthPrime n = (1 : eliminateMultiples (range 2 100005)) !! (n-1)
 As n increases, so does the time the program takes to access the nth element of the list. Why, and what can I do to make this not true?
 Hazarding a guess: Maybe GHC is smart enough to realize that it shouldn't run eliminateMultiples on the entire list, despite what the code says, because I really only care about one element of the resulting array.
 EDIT: I should clarify that I don't count a number as a multiple of itself.

 For a workshop I am planning I want to ensure that everyone has a quick haskell development setup available, so I created a simple docker image based on haskell's official image. This one includes code-server as a vs-code web IDE.
 The image can be found on docker hub and launched like so, assuming $PWD/code is where your haskell projects are: docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/code:/exercises arnemcnuggets/hs-workshop Notice that the default directory (currently /exercises) can be adjusted by changing the entry-point cmd (currently it's code-server --auth none --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:8080 --user-data-dir /data /exercises).
 You can then navigate your browser to localhost:8080 and start programming haskell with linting, type hints and formatting.
 The environment is, of course, by no means to be used in production but rather for education.
 This is kind of the first docker contribution I made so feedback is welcome!
 Edit: it comes with dark-theme (my eyes) and the haskell vs-code extension preinstalled for extra little configuration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just playing around with a tiny project, I've found that using HSpec with cabal repl would be really really nice. You could call main to run all the tests, or call hspec XyzSpec.spec to run just the tests you currently care about.
 Problem is that GHCi can only load one component at a time. That means I can't do :r to reload code changes that aren't in the test component. If I'm changing library code, then restarting the repl from Cabal all the time isn't convenient as it is slow.
 As a hacky solution, if I add the library's src dir to my test's hs-source-dirs then it works really nicely. Things reload very quickly. But once you start needing build dependencies in the library, you also need to add them to the test project. This starts to feel a bit messy, build tools for other languages don't require hacks like this.
 Is there a better way to do this? I know there's stack test --file-watch but this is very slow. I'm looking to to make tiny changes rapidly, and the time it makes you wait while it builds the project over and over is inconvenient when compared to the instant reloading in GHCi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Finishing a project and looking to use a function that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points. 
 I know the Euclidean distance formula sqrt of (a-c)2 + (b-d)2
 It would follow the function distance :: Float -> Float -> Float -> Float -> Float
 Ex: distance 3 5 3 5 will give back 0.0
 Having troubles putting this in correctly.

 I have been hacking last weekend on my org-view mode. It can now prettify quotes, verses and centered paragraphs by applying alignment and custom faces to quotes, verses and if specified author names of those.
 Org-view should now also work in older versions than the current master :).
 At this time only available from the GitHub repository.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the first production release of Scalqa project. 
 Scalqa was first introduced on Reddit last summer with the "Scala3 Quick API" post. Few more discussions followed:
  
Perfect Int Loop
 Perfect Time Library
 Boost data processing speed with heavy ops
  Void Request Pattern
  GUI Could Be Easy
  Creating New Numerical Types
  
So the feature set was pretty much complete long time ago and it took many months to refactor, refactor, and refactor. At this stage there are no good ideas on how the project can be improved any more, so it is time to stabilize the code base. From now on the future releases will be binary compatible with version 1.0 and any large changes will be rejected unless absolutely necessary.
 Maintenance wise, based on experience, I expect to spend from 1 to 4 hours a week to fix any incoming bugs and make a new release every 1-3 months. Otherwise, I will move on to invest/trade markets full time, using Scalqa as enabling technology. But, I am standing by to devote all my energy back to Scalqa if needed.

I'm new to this software, but I've tried many other apps that offer similar functions, including desktop wikis. regular wikis, and various notebook programs, some designed for programmers, some for writers. (I'm a writer.) My criteria are that the app must allow simple links, and save as separate plain text documents (not a database) which can be viewed in Finder and edited in other apps.
I've worked with text files for many years. What really sealed it for me was the experience of opening files from the 1980s. I could open old text files with ease, but not old word processor files, including files from Microsoft Word 2.0.

I want to symbolically link all my org files to one org folder, but it seems like this breaks my auto-tangle setup. The strangest part to me is, when I navigate to /.emacs.d/ to open the original file, that won't tangle either. So its not just using link that's the problem. Its like having a link pointing to that file at all prevents tangle from working on that file. When I remove the link it goes right back to tangling. Does anyone know of a solution off hand?

 I'm using LSP-mode for C++ and I can't find how to pass arguments to clang-tidy. It's annoying because I'd like to use C++17 functionalities which flycheck flags as illegal (though they are not). 
 My config does have (lsp-clients-clangd-args '("--clang-tidy")) but I don't know how to pass arguments to clang-tidy, through clangd.
 Any combination I could think of, of '("--clang-tidy --std=c++17"), '("--clang-tidy" "--std=c++17"), '("--clang-tidy -extra-arg=-std=c++17"),... failed. 
 I thought about using a .clang-tidy file instead but there's no example of such a file in the clang-tidy docs. 
 Any help would be appreciated! 
 P.S: This issue can be reproduced with any post C++17 feature, such as std::optional.

 Button is a metaphor for shortcuts. You always wanted a big red button to launch something based on the context. Hyperbole makes that possible. Buttons are both for novice and experts. And probably helps novice to become experts by learning more about Emacs.
 Buttons can be created in personal button file (~/.hyperb/HYPB), directory specific button file (HYPB), in the current buffer (org, python, any other). Location of the button defines how they can be accessed. For exampl…]]></summary>

 We have IO, which encapsulates IO operations like read, write, open, close on the filesystem or network layer, but it would be nice to have something similar to resource management and deterministic memory allocation tactics.
 Rust goes in that direction, but is further away from the functional paradigm.

 Today such surprise was the podcast "God's Programming Language" with Philip Wadler. https://corecursive.com/021-gods-programming-language-with-philip-wadler/# 
 To my surprise around the 32nd minute, they talk about types. There I learn that the types used in functional programming, despite the same word being used, are not the same as types used in languages that inherit from Fortran. 
 Do you think that tutorials that start with Strings and Integers lead you down the wrong path? How can I tell what is executed at the compilation stage and what is executed at the runtime stage?
 If I were to have another go would I be able to find a tutorial that explains and builds on correct principles?

 I'd like to use Helm to search through my org-roam notes for a keyword...not just the titles, but the content in the files/notes for all notes in the roam directory. I have seen helm-occur and it looks great, but from what I've seen it only works on open buffers. So what I'm looking for is helm-occur results for all files in a specified directory.
 I got this working on Dired...well someone else did and yes, I copied it. I'm hoping to replicate the same functionality with Helm...
 Thanks for any pointers!

I have recently discovered Zettelkasten in my search for an information management tool. I have used TiddlyWiki and TheBrain before, and I'm a great fan of the idea of interconnected "atomic" thoughts. I'm trying to adapt this system to my work. Unfortunately, it is far from academic literature research which seems to be the classic application of Zettelkasten.
I manage reliability test of semiconductor products. I deal with a lot of interconnected information for product reference and project tracking. For example, a product is made using a certain technology and may have several part numbers using different package types. The same package types or technologies can be used for other products. Qualification includes several reliability tests, each done on several lots. Each lot/test is…]]></summary>

EXCEPT, mouse scrolling should work too, and here I've run into the fact that I don't really know how emacs works. I've seen this is a question on the issue tracker without resolution:
 https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/issues/390
 I see that as I scroll the mouse, or more accurately touchpad, I get wheel-down/double-wheel-down/triple-wheel-down (or up) and these are all mapped to the same (Mac specific?) event: mac-mwheel-scroll but as expected, mapping all the various mouse events I see in lossage to mac-mwheel-scroll doesn't work. In fact, mapping them even to normal scroll events only SORT of works.
 Anyone have any hints? My temporary "solution" is to just use the hydra that allows for other keys, but that is causing some serious OCD. I was thinking of defining a pre command hook that detects whether I am in a hydra and what the command is, but that seems like a hack if there ever was one. Any suggestions?

I'm moving thousands of existing text documents into TheArchive.
I've used NameMangler to add unique IDs (based on file creation time) to the start of all the files, so a group of files that looks like this...
Adobe Audition.txt
... gets turned into this...
2020-02-15 083059 Adobe Audition.txt
I then drop this list – thousands of files – into a text document called "UNSORTED FILES.txt" . Then with a grep-based search and replace in BBEdit, the list gets transformed into this...
[[2020-02-15 083059]] Adobe Audition.txt
Now I've got a document I can open and edit in TheArchive, and everything is nicely linked.
But I don't know what's inside Sketch.txt and I'd like to add more details. If I click on the link, the file opens up and I can see it's a comedy sketch I was writing about an inept iPad user. I'd like to add that information to the description in the UNSORTED FILES document, but how do I get back to where I came from? I can see UNSORTED FILES in the search results list, but if I click on it, I have to hunt for the filename I was editing, because there's no cursor.
After clicking a bracketed link, is there a way to return to the originating document, with an active cursor in its previous position?


OR, is it possible to click on a bracketed link inside a document and open it in a new window or external editor?


OR is there another solution for quickly viewing the content of a bracketed link?

 In this post I present an alternative approach to combinator-based implementations that is significantly faster than classical graph-reduction based solutions.
 As this approach makes use of combinators directly implemented as Haskell functions, it is also much simpler and smaller in size than explicit graph-reduction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent a lot of time grappling with the seemingly hard combinatorial problem of working out what combination of bang patterns, INLINE/INLINABLE pragmas, worker/wrapper transformations, compiler options, etc. I need to use to speed up performance-critical parts of my Haskell projects (I mostly write CPU-bound work, e.g. mathematical software). While it's always a relief when I stumble across a combination that gives a massive speedup, it's often not clear to me why certain things make a big difference in some contexts but not in others (especially bang patterns and INLINE/INLINABLE pragmas). This makes me worry that I may just be overfitting my code to the quirks of the GHC version that I'm currently using (currently 8.10.7 on a 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 machine), and that some of the fruits of my labour will be lost in future when I upgrade. So my questions are: 
  
Has anyone measured and publicly reported the amount of work that it took them to maintain the speed of high-performance Haskell libraries across GHC versions?
 Is there any guidance anywhere on what kinds of performance optimisations are likely to remain beneficial across GHC versions?
  
In case a concrete example would help, I've written a generic foldl' function for linear data structures (lists, pairs of lists, etc.). In a benchmark that I've written for a Wordle solver that I'm working on, I found that I can improve its performance by about 10% by unrolling one recursive call. I then tried unrolling two recursive calls, and the performance was about 8 times worse! So I tried adding INLINE, and the performance was about 16% faster than the original unrolled version. Here's the code for the different versions: GenericFoldl.hs. Is there any good reason for me to think that future GHC versions will continue to make similar decisions about what to inline, so that the performance of unroll2_genericFoldl' won't suddenly plummet after an upgrade?

 The sole and most unfortunate possibility, however, is that I recently installed Haskell Platform (on top of GHCup!) and I suspect that might have ruined things. Alternately, there is a console setting on Windows that's been locked up by Haskell Platform or Winio, which I might be able to unlatch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So today I've found that when displaying a particular window (for what it's worth, it belongs to helpful) I am repeatedly getting an error message:
  Invalid face attribute :family nil 
 There is nothing obviously untoward actually happening, but the error message pops up constantly while I'm navigating in this window, so it's extremely annoying, and I'd love to at least understand what's going on. Especially considering that the likelihood of the bug actually being in helpful is not very high, it's more probable that it's somewhere else in my config -- I've seen it before, just less often.
 By digging through Emacs source, I've been able to find that the actual source of the message is face-attributes-as-vector, a function defined in xfaces.c. Deep in the C code. That's the only place anywhere I can find this error message text.
 Now I'm trying to trace the calls to it to find out just where and what resulted in the nil :family and nothing seems to work, neither trace.el nor Edebug -- it just prints the message and goes off on its merry way. Manually advising it with something to the tune of (defun trace-face-attrs (a-plist) (message "Tracing: %s" a-plist)) (advice-add 'face-attributes-as-vector :before #'trace-face-attrs) doesn't result in advice function getting called either.
 It's like the function isn't actually getting called at all.
 How do I get at the root of this damned thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, I can't know what you are looking for, but I myself just wanted a simple way to store email addresses and insert them with completion when composing new messages. BBDB and the like are way too fancy for me.
 It turns out BBDB has a poor cousin, called 'ecomplete'. To activate it, you just need to
 (setq message-mail-alias-type 'ecomplete) 
 Alternatively, if you prefer to use the standard completion-at-point instead of ecomplete's handicrafted UI (works well with Orderless or flex completion styles) you can use the following:
 (ecomplete-setup) (add-hook 'message-sent-hook 'message-put-addresses-in-ecomplete) (setq message-mail-alias-type nil message-expand-name-standard-ui t) 
 (I wish the above was less hacky to get working, but alas).
 This is ridiculously obscure stuff. I could only find ecomplete after imagining the feature and starting to study the places you need to understand to implement it... So I hope this is a helpful hint for some people :-).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 ​
 My ipython console is getting super slow when the buffer is longer than ~10 000 lines (for example when I accidentally print a very long variable). 
 I know C-c M-o runs the command comint-clear-buffer (found in inferior-python-mode-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function. And running it manually solves my problem. Now, I would like to have it to run automatically when the *Python* buffer is longer than X lines, but can't find how to do it. 
 One related issue is that I shouldn't run into a long buffer limitation than quickly, i.e. I should prevent very long variables (e.g. long lists) from being entirely printed in the buffer. For instance, when print() is called, I would like to only print the first and last 10 entries of a variable if it is longer than e.g. 100 lines. However, here again, I can't find how to do it...
 ​
 Any help would be much appreciated, thank you a lot in advance! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The manual for instrumenting macros states that part of the spec can be a symbol:
  
Any other symbol in a specification list may be a predicate or an indirect specification.
 If the symbol has an Edebug specification, this indirect specification should be either a list specification that is used in place of the symbol, or a function that is called to process the arguments. The specification may be defined with def-edebug-spec just as for macros. See the defun example.
 Otherwise, the symbol should be a predicate. The predicate is called with the argument, and if the predicate returns nil, the specification fails and the argument is not instrumented.
 Some suitable predicates include symbolp, integerp, stringp, vectorp, and atom. 
  
From this, it's not clear to me what it means for a function to "process" the arguments. For example, I would like to see if the arguments match one of several specs. Something like
 (cl-dolist (spec my-specs) (when (edebug-apply spec args) (cl-return t))) 
 Is this possible?

 but received error that 2 ranges try to set @ 3$5 field,
 (i inserted @@#$$# in if statement cause it didn’t let me to leave it blank for “else do nothing”)
 2, So i tried
 @<<$<<<..@>$> = if($# % 2 == 1, if(vlen(@>..0) == 0, vsum(@<<..@>>), @@#$$#), ($-1/@>$-1)*100)
 but now i can’t set ;%.1f formatting for only percentage columns 
 Could someone please help?

 I see I cannot obtain from org as default a behavior quite useful for big files,coming from the mind map world I am quite deluded if cannot find a solution.
 what I would expect:
 Basically imagine I have a huge complex org file with 10 levels of indentation/nesting/nodes. as user I would like to go to an item <XYZ> on let's say level 7, and make gradually expand the item at the 8 level(only from children of <XYZ> not all the org) , then 9 and 10 so that I can have a peek of what information is under that specific part, then go back from 9, to 8 and back to 7, to the original place where i was.
 ​
 What (delusionally) I get:
 is with shift+tab an iteration not useful at all collapsing all the items(?), then back when I am, then expand all the thousands of items I have in my huge org files.
 A remark: I know that few people recommend to make shorter org files separated files, but at the moment I have these huge files( as coming from the mind map world)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I'm writing, I usually start typing in a "scratchpad" document, then, as groupings become more obvious, I add headings, and then, as a section gets longer, I move a block of text to a new document, leaving only the heading and a link in the parent document.
I'm sure this is a very common way of working, and surely how TheArchive is designed to work.
But what's the best way to take a group of paragraphs and a heading, and replace them with concise link?
Right now, I follow these steps. 
It works, but I'm wondering if there's a faster approach built into TheArchive, and what methods work to streamline the creation of child documents. Mine seems to take more steps than I would expect, and the Cut operation makes it a bit precarious. A lot of the time, I miss step 7 and paste the text into the search bar. I also worry that I might make a second Copy operation and lose my cut text.
Is there a way to click on a link and force the creation of a new document, rather than  having to search for a nonexistent document then hit Enter to create it?
Is there a safer way to move a block of text into a new document, rather than cut, change documents, paste?]]></summary>

 However when I run 'cabal update && cabal install pkg:haskell-language-server' in terminal, I get the error message:

 when matching 'pkg:haskell-language-server' we found haskell-language-server

 I am currently setting up Org-Roam and I like to have a note with contact information for people I interact with regularly that I can then link to in every Task that is somehow connected to this person. 
 The linking itself works without any issues, but if I completed a task I tend to archive the task to a *.org_archive file to avoid clutter in my todo-lists. I would still like to see the backlinks to the archived tasks when I look at the note with the contact information, but unfortunately, org roam does not show the task anymore afterwards. 
 Is it possible to configure roam in such a way that it does not only look at the "normal" *.org files but also the *.org_archive files? 
 ​
 Thanks very much in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using ansi-term for a while, and I recently tried switching to vterm. It looks and works pretty well, but I'm having a problem with how vterm cycles through your command history. In zsh, if you type something and press the up arrow key, you get the last command you used that starts with what you've already typed. This works fine in ansi-term, but in vterm, it just cycles to the last command that was used in that vterm session. I was wondering if anyone knew if there was any configuring that I need to do on either end to get this to behave the same way in vterm as it does in ansi-term.
 ---EDIT--- Editing to clarify that it's specifically the matching of the already typed command that's not working. I can cycle through the history without issue, but sometimes I'm sshing onto a machine, or doing a repetitive task, and prefer to have zsh search for the right command for me.

 I would like to find a file to open, but... 
  
it is in my home directory somewhere, but I don't know where
 I have only a vague recollection of its name and the name of the directory in which it resides.
  
If I were in my terminal emulator, I would navigate to ~, then emacs (or similar) then do a ~fzf~ search for the filename, while mashing in some of the directory name which I can remember. I'd then select the file from the list of suspects.
 What is the best way to get something like this happening with my vertico setup? 
 I like the way the ~ suffix works, I would just like it to go recursive, basically. I can't use helm or ivy, as a package I have to use is incompatible.
 Hopefully this is super simple and I'm just missing something obvious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Bird's book on algorithms in Haskell:
  
3.3 Arrays
 One of the main differences between functional and procedural algorithms is that the former rely on lists as the basic carrier of information while the latter rely on arrays. In functional algorithms input usually consists of a list of values, whereas in procedural algorithms input values are usually assumed to be presented as the elements of an array. For a procedural programmer array updates are destructive: once an array is updated by changing the value at a particular index, the old array is lost. In functional programming, data structures are persistent because any named structure may be referred to at some other point in the computation and therefore has to continue to exist. Consequently, any update operation, even at a single index, has to be implemented by making a new copy of the whole array. Because they cannot be changed but only copied, purely functional arrays are known as immutable arrays. It is possible to get round this problem and allow mutable structures by encapsulating the operations in a suitable monad, but we will not introduce monads in this book.
 Wholesale or monolithic updates, on the other hand, are ﬁne. Changing all or some of the entries at one go involves copying the array only once. Haskell provides a number of such wholesale operations in the library Data . Array. The purpose of this section is simply to describe the main functions in this library.
  
What does "wholesale or monolithic update" mean? Does it mean exactly "any update operation, even at a single index, has to be implemented by making a new copy of the whole array"?
 Is a data structure with "wholesale or monolithic update" a mutable or immutable one?
 Does library Data . Array provide mutable or immutable arrays?
 Thanks.

 elisp (defun my/make-copy (file) (progn (setq new_file file) (setq index 1) (while (file-exists-p new_file) (setq new_file (concat (file-name-sans-extension file) “_” (number-to-string index) "." (file-name-extension file))) (setq index (1+ index))) (copy-file file new_file))

 I have compiled and installed Emacs 28 pgtk.
 When I start Emacs it changes the background color three times.
 First it starts gray, then it turns white and then finally my theme color, which is a dark gray (from Nord color palette).
 My previous version, Emacs 27, honored the .Xresources and would start with the same color of my theme.
 I have tried running 'xrdb -merge .Xresources' before running Emacs. It did not help.
 I am running Emacs inside i3wm, which uses xorg. Everything else runs fine.
 Is it possible that Emacs-pgtk does not honor the .Xresources anymore?
 Do you think it is a bug?

 org-roam-mode-section-functions’s value is (org-roam-backlinks-section org-roam-reflinks-section org-roam-unlinked-references-section) 
 but that section never shows up. To test, I made nodes "Scheme", "Emacs Lisp", and "Programming Languages" that explicitly link to each other. I then made another node and wrote sentences including those titles. I tried variations on capitalizations and spacing to see if I misunderstood what would be counted as an unlinked reference. The unlinked references section has never shown up in the roam buffer.
 I saw that it doesn't work in windows, but I'm on mac. I saw several mentions to ripgrep, so I installed it. I tried restarting Emacs a few times, just because. I referenced other people's configuration that have this working.
 It feels like I'm missing something obvious. Do you know what I need to do to get unlinked references to work?

 For example, if I'm editing a C++ file like this:
 application icoFoam; startFrom startTime; startTime 0; stopAt endTime; endTime 20; deltaT 0.05; writeControl runTime; 
 Whenever I save it, Doom Emacs changes the format like this:
 application icoFoam; startFrom startTime; startTime 0; stopAt endTime; endTime 20; deltaT 0.05; writeControl runTime; 
 I tried disabling electric-indent-mode, but it did not work.
 Anydoby knows how can I modify this behaviour? I just want to mantain the original format when saving a file.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I want to start experimenting a little bit with Scala. I'm a Java developer and I'm using Intellij Idea Ultimate.
 Usually, I use asdf for managing different versions of java, elixir, etc... What is a recommended tool in the Scala world? I see that there is a CLI called coursier. Or should I continue working with asdf? I'm asking this because it seems to me that coursier gives us the option to install additional tools like scalafmt? 
 Also, should I pick Intellij Idea for Scala 3? Any first-hand experience here - I saw a couple of posts over here, but they are a couple of months old, so I'm wondering if the situation is better now, or maybe to try with Neovim + native LSP + Metals?
 ​
 To be honest, I expected that tooling will be much more mature for Scala because it is almost mainstream language :)
 ​
 Thanks in advance for your suggestions.

I have tried excluding packages but nothing helps. Maybe I am doing it wrong. Could someone please help me.
 ​
 here is the complete build.sbt in which i tried excluding the org.slf4j. I believe it is due to this dependency having more loggers. I am sorry for the screenshots but whenever i encapsulate the text in code block it gets all messed up when I post it.

This problem comes up in many kinds of decentralized systems, and different solutions have arisen for each use-cases.

But, I still feel from time to time as if I am going to end up with another mess full of useless tidbits...
So, my questions are, how do you decide what is important? And, how do you keep from cluttering your ZK?

 Quick description of what's going on: I use LSP and am learning Java right now. Am trying lsp-java (which brings dap-java). LSP works fine with the jdtls server. However, when running any flavor of dab-debug in any Java project I get the following:  Error: LinkageError occurred while loading main class sol.TestRunner java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Preview features are not enabled for sol/TestRunner (class file version 61.65535). Try running with '--enable-preview' 
 I've changed lsp-java-java-path and dap-java-java-command to another version Java and added the "--enable-preview" argument to lsp-java-vmargs and dap-java-args to no avail.
 As far as I can tell everything related to java is updated to the latest version. Any tips for troubleshooting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I just god Eglot working with Company, but, I was wondering if Eglot has equivalent functionality to LSP-UI, like a popup-menu, documentation, and so forth?
 Or will I need enable some extra company feature to get this type of functionality with Eglot?
 https://github.com/company-mode/company-quickhelp
 ^ This extra company-quickhelp package looks useful, but I want to check if Eglot has it's own built-in UI functionality to implement stuff like this?
 Note: I'm transitioning from lsp-mode/lsp-ui to Eglot, so there's a lot I don't know and Eglot is still lacking in the documentation area. Eglot itself seems similar to lsp-mode, but I'm not sure what's the best way to get lsp-ui like functionality working with Eglot?
 I'm confused about this, so I figured I'd ask here.
 Thanks in advance for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a list of type [Integer], called "ints"
 I'm trying to compute the highest integer, that is less than the first element of "ints" divided by some other number "limit"
 For example, if the first number is 20 and "limit" is 2, then the result should be 9, because it is the greatest integer less than 10. If the first number is 21 and the "limit" is 2, then the result should be the greatest integer less than 2.5, which is 2.
 To compute that, I use this expression:
 ceiling (head ints / 2)
 However, doing this gives me this error:
 "No instance for (RealFrac Integer) arising from a use of 'ceiling.'"
 "ceiling" expects a RealFrac, and head ints / 2 returns a Fractional.
 My understanding is that I ought to cast "head ints / 2" to a type that GHC knows how to perform the "ceiling" function on.
 What I'm wondering is, what do I do now?
 As always, thank you in advance for your assistance.

 Error in stage [akka.stream.scaladsl.MergeHub$$anon$2$$anon$3]: Upstream producer failed with exception, removing from MergeHub now 
 In general this error indicates that some exception occurred further upstream in the graph, but there's no indication of what or where in our logs. In particular I found through step-debugging that some TCP connection was reset, but again there isn't enough contextual information to determine where, what or how. It's not even clear if the source is production code or framework code.
 I'm also considering rewriting this without Akka Streams since this is almost impossible to troubleshoot, so I am interested in learning more about alternative frameworks for processing events.

In particular, I'd like to have keyword expansion trigger snippet insertion in the buffer. I think this should be possible, but I'm not seeing the same set of options in my completion popup as I see in vscode, and choosing the function completion only completes the word, rather than filling in a snippet template. Hopefully the images below help to explain the issue.
 I think I'm using the same language server that vscode uses -- mine is tsserver 0.9.5, from what I can tell vscode uses the same one.
 Any hints? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So an important part of a lisp is knowing whether any thing is an atom (symbol, number, or empty list).
 However, my parser is being fed a string, so it returns strings. What I need to be able to do is, given a string, determine whether the value it contains can be expressed as an Int, a Double, or just a string, then return the value as that type.
 For example, if my atom function is fed a "3", it should return 3 as an Int. If it gets a "three", it should return "three".
 Is this even possible in haskell? The implementation I'm working off of is in Python, which is dynamically typed, so it's very easy to implement this. However, Python is slow, and I wanted a challenge.

 It was until last year that I've switched from "keeping frequently used link targets on top of each Orgdown file" to "using bookmark.el to store and retrieve frequently used headings".
 Unfortunately, bookmark.el does use bookmark definitions that do often break when the absolute position within an Orgdown file is changed. That happens mostly when I add a substantial number of lines before the bookmark position. When I did get it correctly, this is because its absolute position is changed and the bookmark points to a wrong spot because the context-strings of the definition files can't help any more to fix the exact position.
 There are things like bookmark+ which extend the functionality and versatility. I don't know if they do use a different and more robust bookmark definition.

 [MY PROJECT] ↳ NEXT My next task :my-tag: 
 wherever it finds a sub-tree like this,
 * MY PROJECT :my-tag: ** NEXT My next task 
 However, I want that the text [MY PROJECT] has a distinct face (nano-strong, for example).
 I tried using a propertize, but it does not change the face that I want. 
 This is my best try,
 (defun my/org-agenda-format-breadcrumbs () "" (let ((breadcrumb (org-format-outline-path (cdr (org-get-outline-path))))) (if (string-empty-p breadcrumb) (concat " ") (concat "[" (propertize breadcrumb 'face 'nano-strong) "]\n ↳")))) (setq org-agenda-prefix-format '((agenda . " %i %s") (todo . "%i %-12:c") (tags . "%(my/org-agenda-format-breadcrumbs)") (search . "%i %-12:c"))) 
 What am I doing wrong?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am familiar with programming in Scala and am getting interested in http4s and the Typelevel ecosystem. I know functional programming concepts such as type classes, folds, monads, etc. from programming in Haskell but not sure how to map these onto Scala. What is a good resource for learning about how to use these functional concepts in Scala? I find the docs of the Typelevel libraries to be a bit lacking in explaining what the reasoning is behind design decisions. Ideally something which explains the functional programming theory and then how it gets mapped onto these libraries would be great.

The three categories are: fleeting notes, permanent notes and project notes.  The role of the fleeting note in Ahrens's account of the Zettelkasten method  is more significant than its name suggests, because of the attitude toward writing that Ahrens wants note takers to adopt. The fleeting note has a normative function in How To Take Smart Notes. Ahrens wants writing to be the reason that note takers do virtually anything. This would be the case if one were to "make writing the only thing that counts."
First, a capsule summary of the three descriptive categories, with fleeting notes last.

 FreeT f m Void 
 This worked, with:
 ​
 ```haskell
 instance (HasTrie (f b), HasTrie a) => HasTrie (FreeF f a b) where
 newtype (FreeF f a b :->: c) = FreeFTrie (Either (f b) a :->: c)
 trie f = FreeFTrie (trie (f . either Free Pure))
 untrie (FreeFTrie f) = untrie f . (\case Free x -> Left x; Pure y -> Right y)
 instance (forall a. HasTrie a => HasTrie (f a)) => HasTrie (FreeT f [] Void) where
 newtype (FreeT f [] Void :->: b) = FreeTrie ([FreeF f Void (FreeT f [] Void)] :->: b)
 trie f = FreeTrie (trie (f . FreeT))
 untrie (FreeTrie f) = untrie f . runFreeT
 ``` 
 but in the process I started to wonder if generics could derive this, maybe using representable-tries, or if there was some other advantage to be gleaned from that library.

 C-h c C-a
 The C-h c command doesn't respond with anything. It doesn't know that I typed C-a. All other basic commands that I tried does work.

 And here's my config:

 Anyways, others recommended that I try some Emacs Distros like Doom and Spacemacs, because things like language servers work out-of-the-box.
 So which Emacs Distros would you recommend for this use-case?

Years ago, someone copied a version of melpa into a local directory on the air-gapped server. In my init.el, I setq package-archive to something like (("local-melpa" . "/path/to/the/melpa/dir")) so that it points to this local directory. I'm wondering if there is a tool to facilitate this sort of mirroring? I would like to update my packages on this air-gapped network. I am able to copy files onto the system from a less restricted workstation with internet access. Is it just a matter of unzipping the melpa repo and pointing package-archive to the fresh melpa directory?

 Quick question,
 What is the correct way to add python-mode to company-backends, so that Eglot can find python-lsp-server?
 Note: I'm using use-package.
 Also, when Eglot attempts to load python-lsp-server, a module pkgs_resources error is thrown?
 I'm not sure if this has to do with the company-backends issue?
 Thanks in advance for the help

 I’ve notice in my place of employment there is even a rule that we’re not allowed to use IOC Containers for dependency management because it’s not the “functional way”
 Is this a common mentality? There are always parts of a large enterprise code base where being strictly functional is impractical in my opinion, hence why scala enables object oriented solutions in these cases. 
 Is this sentiment wide spread? Is that why no one has adapted a Java IOC framework for Scala natively (or implemented their own)?

 ​
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands

 ​
 I would like to have the first part of buffer (ie. Global List of TODO items of type EXAM), sorted by timestamp/schedule.
 And displaying each date accordingly.
 I have tried to change the columns variable, but the result I got was a row on the top, without altering the rest of the buffer.
 ​
 BTW, what is the difference between just adding a timestamp, and adding a SCHEDULED ?
 I have read the org docs about this difference but I do not understand it...
 ​
 Thanks in advance.
 Sorry for my poor English.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've setup zone-mode to trigger after some minutes adding 
 (require 'zone) (zone-when-idle 120) 
 to the init file, and it works sweetly to obscure the text and prevent casual snooping... most of the time. Some of the zone modes are quite readable, or very slow to become obfuscated. Is there a way I can setup zone so that it'll always run the same program (for instance, zone-pgm-jitter) or, even betterm, a list of programs I choose?
 I've googled around but I didn't find any pointers to that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Is there a list of all the different concepts to learn, required or recommended, to understand Haskell code? My guess is that we can do a lot, including using most libraries, knowing "only":
 ​
  
basic Haskell syntax (functions, lambdas, pattern matching, guards, case, where, let)
 data types (sum, product, algebraic, recursive, polymorphic, records, type synonyms)
 type classes
 referential transparency, high order functions, function composition, currying
 laziness, memoization, tail recursion elimination, strictness, inlining
 module (import and export)
 some actual types (Bool, Text, Int, Float, String) and data structures (List, Maybe, Either)
 some type classes (Ord, Eq, Num, Show, Read, Functor, Applicative, Alternative, Monad, IO, Foldable, Semigroup, Monoid)
 some functions (map, fold, sort, head-tail-init-last, scan, zip, and a few other functions for list manipulation)
 monad transformers
  
​
 What do you think? What's missing?
 ​
 There are so much more, it's overwhelming. Let's see, just from the top of my head:
  
tagless final
 phantom type
 generalized algebraic data types
 arrows
 free monads
 comonads
 lenses (btw, 109 operators in the module… it's never enough apparently)
 continuations
  
And I guess I've only scratch the surface here. I didn't even talked much about the different modules since I don't know them yet. It's been months that I learn Haskell, and each time I learn something, I find another concept. I didn't even take the time to read modules doing actual stuff. What's the minimum to be comfortable writing efficient, idiomatic code?
 Thanks!

a banner image on top of centered text in a buffer (a la certain Notion notes like this), which I thought (in my limited elisp experience) might be achievable via (put-image) and somehow not centering only the first line of the buffer.
 centering quotes or LaTeX align blocks inside Org documents
  
I'm curious as to whether this is even possible, although I'm entirely open to any other ways of trying to implement this that don't involve varying margin lengths throughout a buffer.

 I want to get rid of the prompt, but I don't know where it comes from. And it's also hard to figure it out. Every time I restart Emacs and start typing, I don't see it. It only shows itself after I use Emacs for a while.
 Does anyone know how to get rid of it? By the way, I'm using macOS. I suspect it has something to do with macOS because I didn't see it when I used Linux before.

 I am a new user of Emacs (Following system crafters stuff no less). I am trying to use Emacs for writing fantasy books / Novels. However all the information ive seen has been so disparate that I cant find anything good on how to actually do it.
 ​
 I know ORG-mode is the go to mode for this but I haven't seen much on how to actually convert said mode into epub or mobi or etc. So far Ive only really read ramblings on what you "could" do and not how to do it.
 ​
 Does anyone have any specific website I may be able to look at? Am honestly unsure which subreddit this is supposed to be under
 ​
 Tl:dr Assistance on how to use emacs to actually write with. My eyes are going blind from googlefu.
 ​
 Post post - Compiled list of stuff:
 One can use Pandoc to convert from Org to Markdown and then fix that towards a good pandoc for E-books (no information on how to do that well on this thread nor is it emacs specific)
 https://github.com/kawabata/ox-pandoc can be useful for going org to other associated
 Using Org and Latex is another way (most likely the best for conversion)

In my current setup, I have an easy way of getting the path to any PDF associated with my an entry in my main .bib file. If I could modify the metadata of a PDF, I might be able to then use the information in the BibTeX entry to update the metadata of the associated PDF. 
 Is there some way of modifying the metadata of a PDF from within Emacs? I keep searching online but most results I find are about attempts to extract information from the metadata in a PDF.

 I'm having trouble getting python-lsp-server working with Eglot, so having some good documentation to reference would be nice.
 Thanks in advance for the help.

I know TheArchive uses Markdown, which treats indented text as a code block. But I would like to indent paragraphs to show a hierarchy of ideas. Paragraphs often contain tags (either web links or TheArchive's own bracketed links), and if the paragraph is indented, the links stop being active. (As a writer, code blocks have very little use to me.)
Is there a way of turning off the default "code block" formatting when indenting a paragraph with tabs?

I've been using it for about two weeks now I found its far from what Intellij Idea offers as of now. So many things won't work in VS code especially with Scala 3 for example,
  
Metals frequently hangs and so is the compilation, run button on test classes disappears etc. 
 Cannot evaluate any expression in debug mode (see here), this is an extremely important feature I use in Idea (especially given that Scala has a very compact syntax structure)
 Autocomplete won't work for Scala 3
 No shortcuts for creating Test class stub from the main class (Intellij idea does it quite nicely, even creating necessary packages under 'test' directory) 
 No option to run test cases at an individual level (currently only at a class level its supported)
  
etc. 
 If all issues like above gets fixed then I guess the VS Code would rock

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to embrace the literate programming lifestyle for everything, especially for my dotfiles. So far, I have successfully managed to convert all my configuration files and custom shell scripts into Org files that tangle into the proper file formats, but I have been unsuccessful in doing so for my custom snippets. I have several snippets meant for Org-mode, an example being a file with its content being the following:
 # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 #+END_SRC 
 The snippet will create a source block that will tangle its contents into `user-config.el'. The problem with this is that I cannot get such a file out just by doing what I normally do to tangle files. I tried the following:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle test.sh # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 #+END_SRC #+end_src 
 I tried to distinguish the real source block from the one that I wish to be exported literally by using indents and different capitalisation but the file I get by tangling this is
  # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 
 It clearly cuts off at the first #+END_SRC block. It's not a crippling issue but seeing how I have a whole directory of non-Org files in a repository of only Org files is quite uncomfortable. Does anybody have an idea how I can go about this awkward limitation?

 (setq corfu-auto t corfu-quit-no-match t corfu-quit-at-boundary t) (setq completion-styles '(orderless) completion-category-defaults nil orderless-component-separator "*") (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda () (setq-local orderless-component-separator " "))) 
 Basically this means that for in-buffer completion, the * character is used as separator for substrings, and for minibuffer completion this character is SPC instead.
 I really cannot understand how anyone would keep corfu-quit-at-boundry to nil, plus SPC as the default component separator. Writing code like this is hell, every time I press space after defining a new variable, corfu keeps searching for an existing variable instead.
 The problem with my configuration is that * is sometimes (e.g. in php-mode) seen as a non-word character and therefore completion stops after inputting it. Is there a way to add * to the character list considered to be a word? For example, this setup does work in shell-mode.
 Thanks a lot in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Zettelkasten friends,
I've made a few packages for working with my archive in Emacs, and thought you might like to take a look.
The general package, "zk," is a basic set of functions for working with notes -- creating new notes, creating links, finding backlinks, renaming, searching, etc. It uses only built-in features of Emacs --- so no external dependencies. And it can be extended and modified in all the ways that Emacs can be extended and modified. My thought is that it could provide a baseline for people to fork and craft a set of functions to their own liking.
It just became available on Melpa and you can see a demonstration here: https://youtu.be/BixlUK4QTNk
The other package is called "zk-index," offers two additional interfaces for browsing your notes.
The "ZK-Index" interface is a persistent listing of notes, in a dedicated buffer, that can be sorted (by date of modification or creation) and narrowed down by title or note contents.
The other interface, called "ZK-Desktop" (included in "zk-index"), offers a way of working with smaller selections of notes, for specific projects for example. You can select notes from the index to "send to the desktop," where you can arrange them however you want, add commentary about the arrangements, etc. Like working with notecards on a desktop.
You can see a demontration of the index and desktop features here: https://youtu.be/7qNT87dphiA


Note that "zk-index" is still a work in progress, so it's only available in the dev branch of the zk repository. But it's been working for me, so if you give it a shot and have some notes, please let me know, either here or in Github Issues!
On compatibility, "zk" is fairly configurable, so it should be able to work with your current archive, maybe with a little configuring. I started my own note-taking using "The Archive," and the format of my notes and hasn't changed at all, so these packages should (I hope!) work with your existing archive.
Let me know what you think!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm learning FP at the moment from the perspective of category theory and trying to understand what makes FP so special.
 I understand the imperative languages require explicit "control flow", which is "the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated." (wiki)
 However, the central axiom of category theory is compositionality of morphisms, but then more subtly the associativity of composition. In other words, order doesn't matter. You can compose all these functions without worrying about which order they need to be glued together.
 Is that what makes FP so special?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pleased to announce cleff, a new extensible effects library for Haskell: https://github.com/re-xyr/cleff.
 These are some key features of this library:
  
It has an API similar to polysemy and freer-simple, i.e. you can write effect interpreters as simple case-splitting functions. This means effects are low-boilerplate, easy to understand, and that users of similar libraries can easily get along with cleff.
 It supports higher-order effects implementation, and provides a set of easy-to-use combinators for that. The expressiveness of these combinators are on par with polysemy's Tactics language, and also harder to use incorrectly.
 It uses a ReaderT IO monad as the underlying Eff monad implementation, instead of free monads. 
 Therefore, the overhead of effects is reduced greatly (and gives pretty impressive microbenchmark results).
 IO-based effect implementations provides good interaction with exceptions and concurrency (no more losing changes to State due to exceptions).
 
  
The library and documentation are already available on Hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cleff.

What is Luck?
[[202110172020]] 
#Luck    #Determination    #Preparation
I’ve heard luck defined as simply being well prepared (through hard work of various types) when opportunity comes knocking. I like and believe that definition, particularly because it removes luck from the realm of the mystical.
So then, you might ask, isn’t it just luck when opportunity comes along?  The simple fact is that opportunities always come along. One just needs to be prepared, then patient and persistent (even tenacious), and finally discerning to recognize the right opportunity.  So, you see, luck isn’t the first step nor is it the driving force - it’s rather t…]]></summary>

 I have installed Microsoft’s python-language-server on NixOS, by adding python-language-server to configuration.nix.
 Then I try to integrate it into Emacs. I copy the following into ~/.emacs.d/init.el:
 ;; Include lsp-python-ms in the configuration file: (require 'lsp-python-ms) (setq lsp-python-ms-auto-install-server t) (add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'lsp) ; or lsp-deferred ;; initialization (use-package lsp-python-ms :ensure t :hook (python-mode . (lambda () (require 'lsp-python-ms) (lsp))) :init (setq lsp-python-ms-executable (executable-find "python-language-server"))) 
 (1) I don't want to restart emacs for reloading the above added code in ~/.emacs.d/init.el, because I don't want to kill the programs run from a shell inside emacs. Can I select the above added code region , and hit C-x C-e? 
 (2) When I did that, I saw in the Backtrace buffer:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function use-package) (use-package lsp-python-ms :ensure t :hook (python-mode lambda nil (require 'lsp-python-ms) (lsp)) :init (setq lsp-python-ms-executable (executable-find "python-language-server"))) eval((use-package lsp-python-ms :ensure t :hook (python-mode lambda nil (require 'lsp-python-ms) (lsp)) :init (setq lsp-python-ms-executable (executable-find "python-language-server"))) nil) elisp--eval-last-sexp(nil) eval-last-sexp(nil) funcall-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil) call-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil nil) command-execute(eval-last-sexp) 
 I was wondering if there is something wrong by Debugger entered--Lisp error? How shall I make the lsp work in emacs?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use emacs for everything from taking notes, OS level tasks like organizing the file system and calculating dinner costs, to programming in a variety of languages. Ido mode helps me in opening files and switching buffers without having to remember the exact filenames. I also use tab bar mode that rolled out with emacs 27 to quickly assess which files are open in a glance. For switching between tabs, I use the tab-bar-switch-to-tab command. While it works well, sometimes I do not remember the exact filename(or the case specific name). It breaks the flow of my thoughts when I have to think about the exact filename. That's why I'm looking for an ido mode equivalent for the tab-bar-switch-to-tab command.
 I am happy with the tab bar mode and I do not want to start using other packages just for this additional functionality. Is there any way to customize the tab-bar-switch-to-tab command to have an ido like completion? If not, is it something that can be implemented and how could I go about implementing that - asking for pointers to start with.

 Basically I created a new .el file but fly check gives me a lot of errors like I need to add a bunch of comments to the start of the file. I don't remember what they were but adding them didn't fix anything.
 So I'm wondering is there an easy way to get started with elisp programming in emacs?

 On top of that I think it's got an active background process running or something, because I can't delete the folder which vscode is open in it's parent.
 I'm just learning scala, but I'm not ALWAYS working in scala, so it's been bothering me so much I just disable the extension, but then it's such a pain whenever I want to use scala.

 TLDR: Is there any way to disable the auto import? I prefer to do it manually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm a writer who lives in Germany (12 published novels with Random House), and I started using emacs a year ago and am falling in love more and more. It is perfect for organizing material for my novels, and I even use Mu4e for e-mails by now.
 I would be happy to try to write my next novel with emacs. But there is one thing that just drives me crazy writing prose in emacs, and I wonder whether there is a solution to it. (Olivetti Mode or Writeroom mode do not solve this, regrettably.)
 When writing prose, I don't want to have a blank line between each paragraph, but to have them indented instead. It just looks awkard to me, to have lines of dialogue like this:
 "I met another woman", he said.
 .
 "Who is it?"
 .
 "You don't know her."
 .
 She gave him a furious stare.
 ​
 ​
 It reather should look like this:
 ​
 "I met another woman", he said.
 ..... "Who is it?"
 ..... "You don't know her."
 ..... She gave him a furious stare.
 ​
 (Reddit deletes blank space, I had to put dots there.)
 But the indentation shouldn't be Tabs or Spaces, it should just be how emacs displays the buffer.
 Is there a way to make this possible, a way to write prose without blank lines between the paragraphs and to have the first line of each paragraph indented?
 Formatted text properties like "indent more" insert spaces. Maybe this is the way emacs is made, and there is no way to just visually indent (like in a word processor) without putting characters in the document.
 Thank you so much for any help on this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The hl-prog-extra package now supports doc-strings/comments, so it's possible to highlight tags in documentation that you might not want to highlight elsewhere in strings.
 I found this often the case with doc-strings, where conventions such as #123 to reference a bug-report or tags such as FIX, TODO, etc ... make sense to highlight in documentation, but not in regular strings, where only minimal highlighting is useful (escape characters for e.g.).
 The package also has presets for C/Python & Lua (opt-in), so you can have highlighting for Python's escape sequences without having to come up with the regex for this yourself.

 do you have any working config with the angular-language-server with the html file ?
 I can use it if I have a typescript file and the intellisense + flycheck is working well.

 I use web-mode and I start the lsp as well.
 I reconfigure the lsp-clients-angular-language-server-command and it use same as the vscode do.

 I'm curious whether there are there any other tips/tricks that people use to reduce the mental load of carrying a custom config. Is the answer just simplification & reduction of the files? a custom org scheme? sticking to popular, maintained, high bus factor projects?
 Does anyone have a .emacs they havent had to touch or even think about for long periods of time?.. & are not completely bewildered when they come back to it (like i am when I pulled up my old college .emacs)? Curious to hear any suggestions/audacious tales/horror stories.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I'm using emmet-mode for web development in Emacs which is going good, but I'm trying to figure out how to add these 2 pieces of functionality:
  
drop-down-menu-list(I already have yasnippet and hippie-expand enabled and combined with my emmet-mode config), But, I have no idea why a drop down menu is not appearing when I start typing while emmet-mode is enabled?
 For example, when I type: html and then press the ctrl-j keybinding, it automatically creates an opening and closing tag and inserts the the cursor between the tag, but most of the time, after doing this I press: Enter to move the closing tag to the next line, then I manually move the cursor at the end of the opening tag and press: Enter again, which creates a gap in-between the closing and opening tag and automatically places the cursor in the gap, correctly indented. So I was wondering if there's a way that I could add this extra functionality to automate this for me, that way I just have to type the name of the tag like: html, then press Enter on an emmet code snippet in the drop-down-menu-list, which will then create the tags, but with the ending tag 2 lines below the starting tag with the cursor indented in between the gap. I hope that I explained this well enough.
 Functionality to be able and press tab to move the cursor between things like tags and strings in html.
  
Example:
  
type: html
 choose emmet snippet from drop-down-menu-list
 automatically expands like this:
  
<html> 
 | (indented cursor automatically placed in-between opening and closing tags)
 </html> 
 Thanks in advance for the help.

 main logic for checking if a candidate word matches a previous guess-and-colors
 some tests for the main logic
 Colors are specified with numebrs: 
 Green: 2
 Yellow: 1
 Black: 0
 
  
Updates (chronological):
  
I learned about hlint and fixed the warnings, thanks to u/sunnyata
 I'm going through the commits in a PR by and thanks to Zij-IT
 Merged the first PR (using foldl, foldr and zip), thanks to Zij-IT
 Enabled Github actions to run the tests on push!
 In progress: Next I will be trying to define a custom union type instead of Char, as inspired by u/r3dnaz's comments. Let me know if you have any suggestions.

 The mathematical operations on them as separate methods, do in principle it should be possible to have numbers of arbitrary length and infinite precision, as Mathematica has it.
 In Mathematica an integer can have a million digits. That would be hard to scroll, so say 10 thousand or 100 thousand digits. Would that be possible in Scala or Java with BigInt or BigInteger?

 When publishing a library to a central location do you publish a fat JAR including your dependencies or just the JAR of your source code?
 If just the source code, when someone integrates the library into their sbt project, does sbt automatically download/resolve the library's dependencies or do you need to do something else to make this happen?
 In python you have a setup.py file where you specify your library dependencies that pip will install with your source code with the "depends_on" parameter when pip installs your library.

I have about 1200 zettels, mainly about note-taking itself, organic growth, psychology, risk, practice, and other things that interest me outside of work. I'm a software developer by trade.
I thought I might introduce myself with an open-ended question. I recently transitioned from writing paper notes to using Zettlr. (Zettlr + Git just works for me.) One thing I really miss about my old paper ZK is being able to thumb through notes and stumble on things that way. In my new computerized system, I have to explicitly write links and do searches. There is no rifling aspect, and that seems like a bummer to me. Anyone have any similar thoughts? Or recommendations? I'm still working on how to organize things to capture that inherent structure that my old paper ZK had by the mere fact of two slips being near each other. I can type in 1200 slips, but that structure is essentially gone now.]]></summary>

I have a lot of experience recently in distributed computing using Spark or Flink and I really like how these frameworks solve many issues that could go wrong in reality (offering automatic node failure recovery, effectively-once semantics etc).
 I started exploring ZIO and Akka Streams lately and I feel like there would be a lot of burden to run distributed computation using either of those. Especially to solve the issues I mentioned earlier. For me both of these focus mostly on single-node applications that would not scale in reality. I see that by the use of Fibers I can achieve high resource utilization on a single node. I can imagine buildin…]]></summary>

It seems that given the constraint (1 <= n), it should be able to deduce this. Obviously you can give that (1 <= n +1) but then it complains about (1 <= (n + 1) + 1). Is there a way of writing this as an inductive proof or something similar? My guess that there would be some way of using coercions to achieve this but am struggling to find any resources that are helpful. Thanks in advance.

And most other books provide algorithms just an illustration for some neat language feature. The thing is, to get a job as Scala developer these days (in competitive firms) one needs to be a competitive programmer, master of Leetcode, and Scala doesn't seem to have strong ecosystem in that regard as Java, Python or C++. Edit: in DIY spirit and as a learning exercise i'm thinking of translating Sedgewick Algorithms from Java to idiomatic functional Scala, if anyone wants to join this effort or aware of similar ones please let me know Edit 2 (in regards to comments on 'reinventing the wheel' below): if Scala is so great as a language and functional programming flagship, where are all the libraries of functionally implemented algorithms replacing conventional CLRS style imperative/mutable implementations?

 1. Should I use --with-mailutils while building emacs (Or not) for that ?
 I raised this query on IRC emacs and many people mentioned it's not required, but didn't explain clearly why. If it's not required, and If I can setup a client by just adding some mail handling packages later on, then,
 2. I'm wondering what is the use of --with-mailutils, while building ?
 Now that's not the only confusion. I've went through the MailUtils page (assuming that's what emacs will be building, if I specify the option). It mentions that it provides rich set of utilities for mail handling, so why would anyone say not to use it. Does it make Emacs bulky or anything. Idk. I'm just assuming (since they said no). Can anyone please explain me these things to clear the confusion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 In Emacs I'm using Eglot as a language server, and it now supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript really well. The only thing that I'm missing, is how to setup Emmet in Emacs to work alongside Eglot. Having nice scripts will make it easier for me, like when writing HTML templates.
 Attached below is my config passed to VSCode's settings.json file(different syntax but close):
 `
 userSettings =
 {
 "emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab" = true;
 "emmet.showSuggestionsAsSnippets" = true;
 "emmet.showExpandedAbbreviation" = "always";
 "editor.snippetSuggestions" = "top";
 "files.associations" =
 {
 "*html" = "html";
 };
 "emmet.includeLanguages" = 
 {
 "javascript" = "html";
 "django-html" = "html";
 };
 };
 `
 So what Emacs packages and use-package/ELisp configurations will I need to get this equivalent Emmet functionality in Emacs.
 Thanks in advance for the help.

 If you could paste a link to good documentation specific to this, or paste some snippets below, I use the emacs package use-package, so I understand that the most.
 Note: I searched this online, but I can't find specific documentation on setting up Elpy to work with Python/EIN, so that's why I'm asking here.

It can't seem to update the language server past 14.0.0, even though 15.2.0 is the newest version
 It won't ignore words from a dictionary file, even when I put it in the .vscode directory that the ltex-ls docs indicate it looks for automatically
 It won't add words to the dictionary, even with the "add words" code action.
  
Has anyone got their emacs.d file where they've got lsp-ltex configured with any/all of these solved? Or is it just not really ready to be used?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time for a new and exciting hls release:
  
It includes three brand new plugins: 
 Alternate number literals thanks to @drsooch
 Qualify imported names thanks to @eddiemundo
 New plugin to support selection range (aka double click text selection) thanks to @kokobd
 
 Finally hls supports ghc 9.2.1 
 Including core features and many plugins
 Thanks to a great collective effort coordinated by @pepeiborra and with the help of @wz1000, @mpickering and @alanz among others
 
 Hls now also supports ghc 9.0.2 with all plugins but the stylish-haskell formatter 
 Including the wingman plugin thanks to @isovector and @anka-213
 
 And many many fixes and performance improvements, thanks to all contributors!
  
Deprecation notice for 1.6.0
  
As we noted in the previous release we have dropped support for ghc versions 8.10.5 and 8.8.3 in this release 
 We recommend upgrading ghc to the last minor version: 8.8.4 or 8.10.7
 You can read more about ghc deprecation policy and schedule here
 
 After this release: 
 We will remove all project stack.yaml's but two: one for last lts and other for nightly. Temporary we could keep one more stack yaml when nightly upgrades the ghc version, to help in the transition
 We will remove the install script which lives here
 If you want to install hls from source we recommend using ghcup. Download it and run ghcup compile hls --help to get more info about.

 I also do things like map FLT_MAX to the infinity symbol, "alpha" to the alpha symbol, etc.
 I would like to have it that when I use the delete or backspace key on such a symbol, that rather than deleting one character of the underlying ascii text, it would delete the whole region of text that has that display attribute. 
 So, for instance, if I type "FLT_MAX" and it maps to the unicode infinity symbol, backspace wouldn't delete the 'X' at the end of that string, but rather the whole word "FLT_MAX".
 I think I can code something like that myself possibly, by looking at the display attribute of the text before the cursor, but was wondering if someone had already done this.

 I'm converting my work flow entirely to emacs. I normally use tmux to ssh to a machine, and most of the time there are commands that I run that output plain text on the terminal. Most of the time the output I need to copy and paste but only some sections of it.

 Is this possible to do in emacs? 
 Requirements:
  
multiple windows(tabbed like tmux)
 ssh from emacs
 while in that ssh session enter into a mode very similar to vim's normal/visual mode, so I can copy portions of text as well as search through the shell output.
  
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose we want to compare the length of two lists.
 The intuitive approach would be to just compute the length of both lists and then check whether that number is equal for both lists.
 However, if one list is much longer than the other, that this would cause unnecessary work.
 The faster approach would be to use a function like this:
 eqLength :: [a] -> [b] -> Bool eqLength (_:xs) (_:ys) = eqLength xs ys eqLength [] [] = True eqLength _ _ = False 
 This has complexity O(min(n,m)) where n and m are the lengths, as opposed to O(n + m).
 So a rewrite rule in GHC that rewrites (length xs == length ys) -> eqLength xs ys might seem to make sense performance wise. 
 But there is an issue: For lists that have infinite length, computing the length loops indefinitely, where as the eqLength function does not.
 The behavior of the program would therefore be different.
 Do you think such optimizations are sane for the compiler to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am trying to setup a org-roam-capture-new-node-hook, that will add a property to a daily/journal file automatically. while skipping other types of notes.
 here's the function I have
 (defun my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p (file) "Return t if FILE is an Org-roam daily-note, nil otherwise. If FILE is not specified, use the current buffer's file-path." (when-let ((path (expand-file-name file)) (directory (expand-file-name org-roam-dailies-directory org-roam-directory))) (setq path (expand-file-name path)) (f-descendant-of-p path directory))) 
 When I call this normally, I get expected response.
 (when (my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p "/path/to/org/roam/daily/2022-01-26.org") "Cool") : Cool 
 But when I call this from the custom hook function,
 (defun my/add-auto-props-to-org-roam-dailies () "Add properties to org-roam daily entry automatically" (unless (file-exists-p (buffer-file-name)) (when (my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p (buffer-file-name)) (unless (org-find-property "header-args:ledger") (org-roam-add-property (concat (file-name-as-directory (ledger-path-relative-to-org)) (file-name-base (buffer-file-name)) ".ledger") "header-args:ledger") (org-roam-add-property ":tangle" "header-args:ledger"))))) (add-hook! 'org-roam-capture-new-node-hook #'my/add-auto-props-to-org-roam-dailies) 
 This does not seem to work as expected. The call to my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p seem to return nil for all files. Am I missing something here?
 if I remove the check (call for my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p), the property gets added correctly for all files, so rest of the code is working as intended.
 P.S. ledger-path-relative-to-org is a custom function that returns a relative path to where I expect the ledger files to get tangled.

The core idea is to leverage compile-time safety when dealing with i18n files. This is achieved by decoding the translations into case classes and by providing a type safe alternative to printf/MessageFormat which are usually used for String value injection. I consider the library to be highly experimental; the load module in particular is likely to undergo significant changes, error messages and documentation are to be improved.

 ​
 I've used Doom Emacs for a few months now, and from what I've seen, it is EXTREMELY powerful, so I *want* to use it. But here's the problem for me. Some other programs, like VS Code are less powerful, but far, far easier for beginners. For instance the wide array of tutorial videos on YouTube, the way you change keybindings, or the way you download extra packages.
 I think that Emacs can be far more powerful than VS Code, provided you have the proper knowledge about how it works. A great example of this is dired, it's so good that for a while I used it as my main file-manager. What's the best way to go about learning Emacs though? Should I just stop using Doom Emacs, download GNU Emacs and learn that way?

 My work changed its anti-virus software, and my native-comp Emacs init time increased from ~2 seconds to ~15 seconds, because the libraries are now all native code and the virus-scanner goes to work on every one of them.
 Subsequent starts were fast (2-3 seconds) while the scanner had things cached, but later on they will be slow again.
 If you mostly only run Emacs once per session, that's probably not an issue; otherwise it's another thing to consider.
 If you're using a native-comp build and loading libraries seems slow, this is a potential reason for that.

 I was a developer for 2 decades, including asp.net/c# for 16 years. I quit a few years back for early retirement, but I found myself totally bored at home so I learned scala and apache spark for fun. Is that skillset enough to get some work in scala from home? Or would I need to learn kubernetes, akka, zio, cats or other tools?
 Which tools are most valued with scala?
 Thanks in advance for your input.

 In C++, I can do something like:

But the brew installation framework is confusing as hell to me. After some research, it seems like I should use something like one of the following to install emacs:
  
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
 brew install emacs-mac
  
OR
  
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
 brew install --cask emacs-mac. 
  
What's the difference? Also, are there any other options that I should include when installing? (Also note that I want to learn org-mode.)
 A couple people on another thread suggested I install like one of these:
  
brew install emacs-mac --with-rsvg --with-natural-title-bar --with-starter --with-mac-metal --with-glib --with-imagemagick
 
https://github.com/mclear-tools/build-emacs-macos
 
 Note: I don't really understand the above options very well. I don't know what --whit-mac-metal means.

 Its close (see current config below, notably the ivy-height of 1 and keybinds.) already, with very little tweaking, yet gets some extra features. Love it!
 C-s and enter 'foo bar' to search kicks swiper off, and then C-s and C-r to cycle through searches.
 I'm used to using point movement such as C-a or C-n to exit isearch; I'm okay with C-a/etc staying in the minibuf to edit the search criteria. Using enter to complete the search can be okay, though ivy/swiper sometimes gets into this 'need a match!' loop where enter just stays in there... fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, apologies in advance if it's a weird post, but with org-mode and Emacs in general I often end up at a stage where I need someone to explain things to me step by step.
 So, I already use the base org-mode under doom emacs for my drafts for scientific articles and PhD thesis, but I often end up having to switch to Word for referencing. I saw org-ref and helm-bibtex might work for me, since they both offer the possibility of inserting article links to a .bib file, that I would export from my reference manager. I even found a post that explains how to set up something similar, but I find that workflow overwhelming to implement as there is A LOT MORE going on.
 I think the best way for me to overcome this would be to add those things one step at a time to understand how they work.
 All I would need at this stage is to
  
Write things with headers and basic formatting
 Add citations and some piece of content (formulas, images, code, etc.)
 Export to pdf
  
so question would be: can I make a barebone workflow that can integrate all these pieces and make something somewhat functional? 
 My idea would be to try and implement something like org-noter for my PDFs at a later point, while having some minimal functioning setting at first.
 Thank you all in advance, any help is much appreciated.

 (defmacro dup (f x) "Call F by applying X twice." (if (symbolp f) (list f x x) (append f (list x x)))) 
 It does work:

 However, it has some undesireable behaviour:
 (macroexpand '(dup some-function (long (composition x)))) ; (some-function (long (composition x)) (long (composition x))) 
 How do I make a macro that evaluates X once? I understand I could do it with a function, but I like that I don't have to quote things in a macro.

 That mode already define the special case keyword regex and applies the font-lock-warning-face and I want to replace that with my face:
 (,special-case-keywords-regexp . ,my-keyword-override-face) 
 Literally all I've done is define a face and change font-lock-warning-face with my new face.
 It fails with a message i the message biffer saying:

 That's coming from font-lock.
 In the lisp buffer that defines a major mode where I added the face
 (defface my-keyword-override-face '((t :inherit font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic :underline t)) "WTF face") 
 I place my cursor at the end of the defface and M-x eval-print-last-sexp and beneath it in the buffer I see. 
 my-keyword-override-face 
 The 'defface' is at location 4120 in the buffer and directly after that I have 
 (add-text-properties 4120 4127 `(face ,my-keyword-override-face)) 
 Place my cursor after that sexp and M-x eval-print-last-sexpagain. 
 I'm thrown into a lisp debugger

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! 
 I've started using org-habit this week. I can set my habits and see the nice colored consistency graph to track visually my habits.
 However, I would like to have a numeric record of this. For example, something for each habit, I am imagining something like the statistics cookies:
 Number of repetitions done / Number of repetitions scheduled Percent of repetitions done % 
 Or even better, have some stats about how many repetitions I have done a habit in a row (similar to "don't break the chain").
 I was wondering if it's possible to do it directly with the org-habit module or if something else is necessary. 
 Thanks.

Student Loan Forgiveness is Regressive
Subatomic: Knock on effects of across-the-board loan forgiveness.
Surprising second order effects (Trophic cascade [[201901171252]]) of student loan forgiveness. More children of families in the middle and upper tiers of society go to university and take out loans to pay for it. These families can handle the loan burden. They tend to get larger loans to pay for education. That education lands them high paying jobs where they can afford to pay back the loan. Loan forgiveness favors these upper income people to a larger extent and with a larger amount of money than those less fortunate. This increases rather than decreases the economic gap between social classes.
B-The Other [[202102012019]]

  
Across-the-board forgiveness is therefore a costly and ineffective way to reduce economic gaps by race or socioeconomic status. 1
…Accounting correctly for both human capital and effect of subsidies in student lending plans, almost a third of all student debt is owed by the wealthiest 20 percent of households and only 8 percent by the bottom 20 percent. Across-the-board student loan forgiveness is regressive measured by income, family affluence, educational attainment—and also wealth.1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post may belong better on the KM or AppleScript forums, but I thought I'd ask here first mainly because I bet someone will have a far easier process than I'm trying to build.
After writing a Zettel in The Archive, I want to remind myself to review it in a day, and after that, remind myself for a few days later.  A progressive review kind of thing.
I have a KM macro that:
Prompts me for the number of days, from a pre-made list.
Writes a tag (#ReviewXDays, where X is the number of days) to an inserted 2nd line on the Zettel
Copies the Zettel's h1 (from the 3rd character to the end of the line)
Creates an Apple reminder "Review such-and-such Zettel" with a due date of the number of days out
It all works except the calculated Reminders date at the very end.  I think it must be either a variable type problem, or a syntax problem in the AppleScript.  I have a temporary KM Action before the last step that displays the date I'm trying to use.  If I simply copy that (correct-looking) result and paste it as a constant string in the final KM action, it works.  It just won't accept the variable version of that date.
The error is some variation of "execution error: reminders got an error: can't get date (1/27/2022)", depending on the tweaks I've tried in the script syntax.
Has anyone
created some kind of progressive review automation for themselves that's better than this
worked with pushing a due date to Reminders via AppleScript
The image is of the last few actions, where the "make new reminder" line in the AppleScript is where I fail.

...and here is my KM macro (1st time sharing, hope I do this right):
Add Review Tag
Thank you all.]]></summary>

Or does anyone know if FSF actually does offer the most recent version as a hard copy?
 ​
 This is 1337 pages, so it would likely be hardback (but that's not a requirement on my part - I think some print on demand companies I've used in the past had a requirement that anything above a certain amount of pages had to be hardback, though).

It would mean going to a Windows or Mac machine, spinning up the very slow Dymo label making software, getting the GUI designer right, inserting the label text, printing, and wash-rinse-repeat.
 I wrote a gem to provide a simple command-line program to print labels from a shell. As a bonus, it includes some simple elisp to provide printing the current paragraph from within an emacs buffer as a label.
 This is a bit of a hobby project, written as a Ruby gem, but it eliminated a big hassle for me.
 Here is the link: labrat or install the ruby gem labrat.

 Created as alternative to keycast package that does the same thing in mode-line. I was trying this original package but found that it doesn't behave exactly like I wanted so I created my own from scratch.
 Originally it was also integrated with mode-line but since I'm on newer Emacs version I took the opportunity to move it to tab-bar. I think it's much better that way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most developers choose the path of least resistance. Effect systems are not low resistance and its very hard for experienced functional programmers to explain why its so great. Even ZIO that makes it a little bit more straight forward is still a huge leap from where most programmers are. 
 Compare this to say Rust. Rust requires more from the programmers but the rules around borrowing and lifetimes are relativly easy to understand it takes a while to learn fully. But the motivation is there because its performance and its measurable. Do you want your programms to be 2x+ fast then writ it in Rust.
 Effects systems are very abstract concepts. First that you are describing a program in a program. Then the notion that non purity is bad. Monads, functors etc. There is alot to understand because in the long run you need to understand them.
 I'm currently learning and I like it. Not that I'm fully aware of all benefits but I like learning. 
 When I look at the majority of programmers that I have worked with. They like their job and they program in whatever language they happened to end up with and very few wants to invest in learning a whole new paradigm. It's so hard to get developers to let go of Java 8 some times. Most Java developers have probably never used records in Java. 
 So what am I getting to. I don't know actually :-D just something I have been thinking about. 
 What do you think. Can effect systems ever be mainstream? I can't really see it ever happening if most developers doesn't suddenly become super interested in learning new stuff.
 Also if you believe it can go mainstream how us it going to happen?

Reactivity #Self #Persona
In my experience, dogs respond when people have built a strong persona. It is no different with us humans. People who have a strong persona come across to us as dishonest, insincere, insecure and/or generally untrustworthy.
However, we humans have a special tolerance for people with strong personas because we usually have a personas ourselves. In a sense, we humans play a kind of social poker game and are familiar with the rules. We are, in a sense, talented and skilled at interacting with untrustworthy people. We have the security of being practiced.
Dogs, on the other hand, have no persona. The difference between a publicly displayed mask (persona) and a self hidden behind it is not understandable by them. What t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[*all files in a subdirectory
 Hello everyone, I am rewriting my dotfiles with org mode. I created this files in my HOME:
 ├── .config
 │ └── shell
 │ ├── aliases.sh
 │ ├── env_vars.sh
 │ ├── functions.sh
 │ └── myrc.sh
 ├── .docs
 │ ├── hooks.org
 │ ├── setups.org
 │ └── shell.org
 └── README.org
 The shell folder have the result of the shell.org tangled blocks.
 README.org will be my master index for all others in docs. In this file I want it to be something like this:
 Here I was able to use the :toc: header arg, but it only worked for the current file.
  
Table of contents (TOC) (README.org) 
 ...
 
 SHELL (here I want to display the shell.org file TOC) 
 aliases (other file link; in the * ALIASES position)
 env_vars (like aliases)
 function (like aliases)
 myrc (like aliases)
 
 HOOKs (TOC of hooks.org)
 ...
 SETUPS (TOC of hooks.org)
 ...
  
-----------------------------------------------------
 I tried including the shell.org summary like this:
  
SHELL 
 #+INCLUDE "./.docs/shell.org::*TOC"
 
  
But this creates a local link with this extructe: [[#header][header]]. I can't click and they don't work on github. I also have to export the file I'm editing so they show up in the current buffer, it would be nice if they show up after I write the changes like :toc: does (if anyone knows how to do this it would be great).
 Manually I can write the links that work as TOC like this:
  
SHELL 
 [file:./.docs/shell.org#ALIASES][aliases]]
 ...
 
  
I could do this manually, but it would be a lot of work and if I updated or modified external files the README.org would not be updated.
 OS: UBUNTU 20.04
 Orgmode (9.6)

 Key combination: type item 1, shift right arrow to change to TODO, alt enter to create additional item, tab to indent item into a child item.
 expected behavior:

 Actual behavior:

Yet, identifying meaningful properties of the system and giving it suitable

besides properties and inputs, one must also take into account the state of the
system at all times.
It is inconvenient to construct states suitable for testing by hand. An
alternative is to build sequences of inputs that can be iterated over the
initial state, placing the system in a state we want to test. These sequences
of inputs are called traces.
For these traces to be useful for testing, it must be possible to:
report traces to the user in an informative way when some post-condition fails

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately, since switching to using Emacs 28 (using the emacs-plus build), I run into the following issue: when simply trying to open a file, Emacs freezes for a few seconds before doing so. 
 Now: 
  
I've had this happen multiple times when opening a single .el file while visiting a buffer with a different .el file on, so there should be no delay coming from running any mode-related hooks etc, at least as far as I understand these things. 
 I've had this happen long after starting an Emacs session, so any package being loaded with a :defer n call (via use-package) should have been loaded. 
  
I've been trying to use the one tool I sort of knew of for this, explain-pause-mode, but something appears to be wrong with the package but for some reason the package isn't working anymore. I've now had the profiler start by default and tried to look at the profiler report right after I notice the lag, but that hasn't given me any clues. 
 I'm thinking of resetting the profiler every few seconds or so to see if that helps, but I'm wondering if anyone here knows of another way to figure out what's going on. 
 I've been reluctant to bisect my init since as I said before sometimes hours go by without running into this problem.

 Here's an example with a trivial table. 
 The original dump:
 INSERT INTO `student` (`id`, `name`, `class`, `mark`, `gender`) VALUES (1, 'John Deo', 'Four', 75, 'female'), (2, 'Max Ruin', 'Three', 85, 'male'), (3, 'Arnold', 'Three', 55, 'male'), ... 
 the converted dump:
 INSERT INTO `student` (`id`, `name`, `class`, `mark`, `gender`) VALUES ( /* id */ 1, /* name */ 'John Deo', /* class */ 'Four', /* mark */ 75, /* gender */ 'female'), ( /* id */ 2, /* name */ 'Max Ruin', /* class */ 'Three', /* mark */ 85, /* gender */ 'male'), ( /* id */ 3, /* name */ 'Arnold', /* class */ 'Three', /* mark */ 55, /* gender */ 'male'), ... 
 The code:
 (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward ") VALUES" nil t) (beginning-of-line) (search-forward "(") (let ((start (point)) fields) (while (not (eq ?\) (char-after))) (forward-sexp) (push (buffer-substring-no-properties start (point)) fields) (skip-syntax-forward ". ") (setq start (point))) (setq fields (mapcar (lambda (field) (substring field 1 -1)) (reverse fields))) (while (progn (search-forward "(") (let ((fields fields)) ;; make a copy (while (not (eq ?\) (char-after))) (insert (concat " /* " (pop fields) " */ ")) (forward-sexp) (if (looking-at ",") (forward-char 1)) (skip-syntax-forward " "))) (looking-at "),"))))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read the emails in my Gmail account in Gnus but I don't store the emails locally, and instead use Gnus's nnimap backend to fetch them. I occasionally want to link to an email from an Org file and want to know how to do it in a robust way. Linking to an email that is still in my INBOX works, but as soon as it expires the link is dead. I thought using gnus-cache-enter-article (bound to *) would instruct Gnus to keep the email around so the link would continue to work, but it doesn't: oddly Gnus still shows the starred email in my INBOX even if it is marked as expired, but the Org link stops working.
 I don't delete any email from my Gmail account so in principle I could have long-lasting links to emails there. I bet somebody has already figured out what to do. I can think of a few possibilities:
  
Maybe there's a way to process the links to point to [Gmail]/All Mail instead, which seem to last longer, but I believe the also stop working after a while (I'm not sure they do, but I have a vague recollection of testing this once, maybe the Gmail IMAP implementation is responsible for the impermanence).
 
Maybe * doesn't keep the links working, but Gnus has several other ways of marking messages to be kept and one of those methods works (I'm no expert on Gnus!).
 
Maybe there's a convenient way to keep locally copies of the messages in another Gnus backend? Like maybe I can copy a message to some other account which I only use for local storage, and link to that copy instead?
 
 Does anyone have a good method for this, using any of those ideas or a different better one?

 What would that function look like?
 Any help is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using use-package to manage my packages, and running into a (technically ignorable but suspicious) behavior where, after an update, list-packages tells me that there's a ton of packages that aren't needed and can be removed, and to run package-autoremove to remove them. However, this seems to be almost all of my installed packages.
 Is this a known issue/conflict with Melpa packages/use-package/something else, or is it offering to remove the older versions, or is something messed up?
 It's not a huge issue as I can just.... not answer y to package-autoremove.... but it shouldn't be considering everything unneeded. Plus I guess it prevents me from later removing actually unneeded stuff...
 Anyone else have this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Inspired by Emacs From Scratch I decided to upend my IDE functionality in my config for lsp-mode. LSP starts and is functional, but lsp-ui is shoddy. The sideline functionality and the header breadcrumbs do not work. For me this is not a big deal, but what is bothering me is that lsp-ui-flycheck-list does not work. I need to manually run M-x load-library lsp-ui-flycheck and only then will lsp-ui-flycheck-list show me the list of errors on the page. This leads me to believe there is a loading issue somewhere.
 the relevant init section is this:
 ``` (use-package lsp-mode :straight t :commands lsp :hook ((typescript-mode js2-mode web-mode python-mode) . lsp) :bind (:map lsp-mode-map ("TAB" . completion-at-point)) :custom (lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable nil))
 (use-package lsp-ui :straight t :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode) :config (setq lsp-ui-sideline-enable t) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show-hover nil) (setq lsp-ui-doc-position 'bottom) (lsp-ui-doc-show))
 (use-package lsp-treemacs :after lsp)
 ```
 After startup I do see a few relevant error messages:
 ``` ... File mode specification error: (error The connected server(s) does not support method textDocument/hover. To find out what capabilities support your server use ‘M-x lsp-describe-session’ and expand the capabilities section) Error running timer: (error "The connected server(s) does not support method textDocument/hover. To find out what capabilities support your server use ‘M-x lsp-describe-session’ and expand the capabilities section") LSP :: pylsp:11352 initialized successfully in folders: ...
 ``` Can this be the source of the problem ?
 thx. S

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 I have org files with lots of sections of all sorts (markdown, plain text, code, calculations, directory trees, etc., etc.), some of them within babel #+begin and #+end delimiters, some not. All these sections have some implicit foldable structure. Some have exisiting appropriate language modes, some do not.
 My question is, in coding up custom folding commands for these sections, should I try and base the commands on extending the folding functions provided by org-mode, or should I choose my preferred folding library (of which there are many) and extend it, potentially clashing with org-mode in some way?
 I think I like stateful/persistent folding as in "vimish-fold". I prefer staying within the org-mode buffer rather escaping to a dedicated buffer and returning.
 Any pointers to discussions much appreciated.

 I'm on a quest. I've been travelling for a while. And I might be closing on its end, I feel. With Emacs.
 I have MIDI devices connected to a Macbook. I need Emacs to listen to their MIDI events and insert as text. Simple. Just letters or numbers.
 Google has brought me to these ways:
 - emacswiki, emaccordion, midimacs, midi-kbd : based on ALSA (linux), unavailable in Mac OS X.
 - (make-serial-port) : MIDI devices are generally USB, not serial.
 ​
 Could someone point me in the right direction?
