I am currently in search for a good software solution to design visuals and diagrams for my work. Here are some examples that I made using draw.io:



For the book, Christian created more visually pleasing images:


Most of the time, I ignore my software and use the image capture function of The Archive which vastly (!) speeds up my process (important to me). The images look like this:


All images protected by copyright 4.0 (enforced by Interpol, Blackrock, the Illuminati, my secret identity and third personality). So, to the lurker who likes to "borrow/bite" other people ideas:

I'd like to improve my visual game.
I'd like to stop pestering Christian if I need something more pretty.
Sometimes, I use using software as a creative technique.
In few cases, I just want something pretty for myself.
And what is better than appropriate skills by just buying shiny tools? Currently, I am looking at OmniGraffle. But perhaps, you have something way better for visuals like the above?
Many thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, with match types we can easily express "type of the first tuple element":
 type FirstElement[T <: Product] = T match { case head *: _ => head } val good: FirstElement[(String, Int)] = "yep" // val badAsExpected: FirstElement[(Int, String)] = "nope" // error 
 How to do the same for case classes? Using the same match type 
 case class Foo(a: String, b: Int) val wishThisWasGood: FirstElement[Foo] = "but it isn't" 
 predictably fails with match type reduction failed. It would be great to have a parity of generic programming features for tuples and case classes.
 Another related question please. I'm trying to define a match type and a corresponding function that filters elements of type String from a generic tuple. It works on type level:
 type OnlyStrings[X <: Tuple] <: Tuple = X match case EmptyTuple => EmptyTuple case x *: xs => x match case String => String *: OnlyStrings[xs] case _ => OnlyStrings[xs] val works: OnlyStrings[(String, Int, String, Long)] = ("", "") 
 but fails on value level:
 def onlyStrings[X <: Tuple](x: X): OnlyStrings[X] = x match case EmptyTuple => EmptyTuple // Found: EmptyTuple.type, Required: std.OnlyStrings[X] (...) case x *: xs => x match case s: String => s *: onlyStrings(xs) // Found: String *: std.OnlyStrings[Tuple], Required: std.OnlyStrings[X] (...) case _ => onlyStrings(xs) // Found: (xs : Tuple), Required: X 
 this one should be fixable with a more clever type bound, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of themes I try on emacs (macos, version 28.2, from homebrew) have weird heading styling:

 The underlining only happens for some headings and starts at different places. I would like to either fix it or just remove all the underlining styling. The screenshot above is using solarized. But similar things exist for other themes:

 this is with catppuccin theme. Only some of the headings have an extra dark background.
 I tried booting emacs with the only customization being the theme and the issue still exists.
 Does anyone know how to remove or stop these themes from trying to do extra styling. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I am wondering what the current state of the Web Assembly back-end is for GHC? Is the best way to compile to wasm to use the back-end from ghc-wasm-meta? Also, does anyone have any information about how to call functions written in Haskell in a browser? In my experiments with C++, one can tell emscripten to keep certain functions in the wasm binary by prefixing their return type with "EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE". Is there a Haskell equivalent for this?
 EDIT: I think my answer I was looking for can be found here. It seems like this is how you get to keep haskell functions in the wasm binary. I am not entirely sure how to match up JavaScript types with Haskell's, though.

 Learning by building projects is next phase in the learning path. And.. in my quick research I can't find a list either. So I thought A list of Project Based tutorial would help anyone with an 'appetite' for real world experience.
 tldr: caught sight of any tutorial for building projects in Haskell ? append it here... ✍️✍️

 Probably one of the most discussed topics right after Data related ones!
 Yet, we all know things are moving at a fast pace lately.
 I am looking for a lean library without much fuss around easy to manage and set-up for a, as of rn, one man show project. 
 I came along big frameworks like 'play' saw akkahttp to be very popular and of course lately Zio.http.
 Play seems to be very very big and asking for a big learning curve. Akka longs like the mongo(db) of the scala world - not really liking the direction they went w/ their licensing change which happened before I even heard of - I still do not know how to asses the risk of Zio doing it alike.
 I have only very small needs:
 -postgresql driver
 -lightweight threads
 -simple http handling
 I haven't settled on how to server the FE yet, would be nice to find something which integrate nicely but using other tech isn't the end of the world.
 I 'just' need to have simple CRUD on the backend. 
 Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I read there are no standard libraries for that, right?
 What are you using on your backend projects and why? 
 Would be amazing to hear from you guys and your enormous experience!
 ​
 Thanks & Cheeers!

 I'm sick of writing notes to my phone. Anyone have any good workflow recommendations for a Google Pixel 7 running termux as well as a Raspberry Pi device on LAN?
 ​
 Asking since I'm debating if I should just use Emacs via Termux (although probably clunky) and just make note files that get ingested into a folder on LAN that later get slurped up and incorporated as new tasks under a '* Phone Notes' heading or something.
 I'm also planning to probably use Syncthing on LAN too somehow to facilitate the syncing.
 ​
 Curious for your thoughts thanks!

 I already tried the following, which kinda works, but I would like to add it to the use-package-statement as configuration and this doesn’t seem to work. I was wondering if someone here already has made customisations to show the current workspace-name from Treemacs in the doom-modeline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am a medical student from Argentina. I discovered the Zettelkasten method a while ago and was very interested in it, and I wanted to introduce you to my "study method" (actually it is much more comprehensive than a study method).
I did this method in the format of a planner or agenda, which can be downloaded in PDF at www.researchsheets.wordpress.com
This planner has 10 sections, but the method I want to show you corresponds to "section 7: Research sheets". They consist of a template similar to the Cornell method in appearance (top margin, left margin and bottom margin), but with a totally different operation, since these "Research sheets" will serve us to hierarchize and breake down the information, and then add it to a glossary / thesaurus in Microsoft Excel.
The procedure itself is somewhat difficult to explain, so I prefer not to confuse you further and invite you to download the planner and go directly to section 7 - Research sheets.
As I said at the beginning, I think it has some similarities with the Zettelkasten method. I hope my method is useful to you and I am available for any questions or comments.
Thank you very much for reading me!]]></summary>

 It doesn't do anything to associate this with dart files from what I can gather. Has someone trawled through the docs and made this work with Dart? My understanding, after taking a brief overview, is that I need a dart-ts-mode and dart-mode maps to this. The creation of this mode is beyond my scope. (I had a cursory look into c-ts-mode but backed out as it doesn't look trivial ;))
 It's not critical to have, but since I'm doing a small flutter project I thought I'd ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the very bottom of the Quick Start section, it says:
  
Add any configuration which relies on after-init-hook, emacs-startup-hook, etc to elpaca-after-init-hook so it runs after Elpaca has activated all queued packages. This includes loading of saved customizations. e.g.
 (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "customs.el" user-emacs-directory)) (add-hook 'elpaca-after-init-hook (lambda () (load custom-file 'noerror))) 
  
I don't really use the customize feature, anyway, but my config has had the following lines in it since "forever",
 (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory)) (when (file-exists-p custom-file) (load custom-file)) 
 and it was never attached to any hooks. Let's say that I did, some day, use the customize UI to customize a package in my Emacs. When would be the appropriate time to load my customizations file? Before my packages are loaded? After? What would happen if I load a customization for a package that doesn't exist yet, because I'm at a new computer and the package is being downloaded/installed for the first time?

 I have a CSS file, and I am exporting org-mode documents using this CSS as html (the target being pdf documents). It works so far with html. I have been tweaking the CSS file so that my exported doc enforces the company style sheets and looks.
 What I am missing is my logo to be displayed in the top left corner as it would be on any company letter.
 How to instruct org-mode so that this logo is displayed properly in every page of every document.
 I guess this must be added somehow in some property in the org with the size and position ... or maybe in the CSS? I am lost, please help!

 data Config = Config { -- multiple record fields: configXXX :: YYY , (...) } modify config = do config <- m0 config config <- m1 config config <- m2 config -- etc. return config 
 But if we are not working in a monad:
 modify config = let config' = f0 config config'' = f1 config' config''' = f2 config'' in config''' 
 is confusing, it's easy to choose the wrong config.
 So how is this pattern usually solved? Using the Identity monad`?
 Also, since this example use a datatype with multiple record fields, and maybe data in several layers, how can we uses lenses to solve the pattern? I'm not used to lenses.

 EDIT: It was immediately brought to my attention that using magit and evil in the following example is, indeed, a poor example because of magit being autoloaded by calling magit-status. Let's just pretend we're talking about some other packages, instead.
 magit defines a function called magit-status, and evil defines a function called evil-ex-define-cmd, and I'd like to use it to define an ex-command for magit-status.

 $ emacs -nw -q -l /Users/xxxxx/.emacs.d/scimax/init.el 
 It started with I decided to upgrade to emacs 29 using Brew following JKitchin's page, 
 I cleaned out Emacs 28 built from source, 
 I installed Emacs 29 with 
 $ brew install --cask emacs ... Worked very well, got me a useable emacs 29.1, the installation moved the emacs.app to Applications,
 Do not bother with 
 alias emacs='$(/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -nw)'

 I upgraded to the latest scimax using Github Desktop and copying the scimax folder to

 There are other little bits of tweaking, but they are easy stuff.

Currently, major modes like org-mode and magit are supported thankfully (using evil-collection) but unfortunately, I haven't come across a good way to integrated evil-mode with notmuch. Much of the bindings of notmuch and evil-mode overlap with each other, thus hampering the bindings of notmuch. Currently, I'm just disabling evil-mode in every notmuch buffer and am using the standard emacs bindings.
 So as per the title, is there a way to integrated notmuch and evil-mode? Or perhaps use just a subset of evil-mode in a notmuch buffer (like simple "j" and "k" for moving around for example).
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /r/scala,
 sorry for asking you to do my job, but I'm trying to assess how much "future proof" is a scala codebase we inherited that we are interested in making the primary product for my company. I just studied a bit the language (and I loved it), observed the ecosystem and lurked here and somewhere else, but I'm not able to do this kind of risk assessment on my own as I might be influenced by some echo-chamber effect. I'm also incredibly sorry for being not precise in my descriptions, again I'm not super familiar with the ecosystem.
 The codebase has around 6-7 years I guess, and it's a Scala 2 100k LoC web api backend based on a Play multiproject setup (many folders with an sbt project inside + a sbt project outside in the root folder, no src/main/scala structure).
 The signatures…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I usually run Xtoolkit based Emacs (the version without any gtk code at all) and it runs perfectly fine. I've tried the old GTK version and the Webrender fork in the past and now recently tried the pGTK version. They all run extremely slowly. I don't have exact measurements but were talking ballpark half a second for anything to happen when I hit a key. It gets much better when I disable transparency but it's still far, far behind the X toolkit version.
 Based on what I've seen elsewhere I was expecting the pGTK version to be faster (like the tui version which is noticeably better than X) or at the very least equivalent with the X toolkit version.
 I installed Emacs via nix from the emacs-overlay.
 What am I doing wrong that it's so slow?

 I heard scala has an amazing community and I happy to join it as of right now!
 I recently was looking for a new stack for my next webapp projects. After working with golang for some weeks I was just frustrated on how bad the documentation is. As a former Java Developer I felt home right away with scala. Considering that I heavily do in data engineering and not being a fan of the Python Syntax and especially not pip I might found my swiss-army-knife with Scala!
 Still getting around with this massive eco-system. especially since it seems like it works just fine with every Java related (such as frameworks, libs) I throw at my scala projects it will just do fine.
 I am also very excited to know that there are even Javascript and LLVM compiler to run system target bins.
 Seems like one language/ecosystem to rule them all. 
 How did you end up here?
 I mean kotlin does also make bold claims and golang is super hip, isn't it?

At the end I want to select as a target a file from the list of files with this special property and insert under the block * History
 What would be the best approach here, to have the file selected in the minibuffer (fuzzy matching) used as a target in the capture template?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like there's been tons of threads on this topic but they just left me feeling more unsure after looking through them. Here are my concerns which mostly revolve around Org-mode:
  
CommonMark vs Org-mode for writing only? I feel like the only advantage of the Org syntax are footnotes and tables.
 
Is the Org syntax set in stone? Like if I don't use any advanced features or extensions will my org files be fine with future updates to Org-mode? I have heard stories of org files being outdated and breaking.
 
Does large org files get slow (50k-70k words though I doubt my files will ever get that big)? 
 
Reference management on Emacs vs Neovim? 
 
Is exporting from Org-mode to Docx easy? According to this article there're still issues with the final output Docx files sadly, cause then I will have to open up Pages to fix them which may cause further formatting issues.
 
Org on Emacs vs Org on Neovim?
 
Is Emacs or Neovim better for LaTeX?
 
Is Emacs much slower than Neovim? I only plan to open it when working on a project and not to take notes all the time so a bit slow startup time is acceptable - being slow while working is unacceptable though.
 
Is Emacs high maintenance?
 
 And if I do choose to use Emacs, should I use Doom-Emacs or just the vanilla config files - I heard Doom disabled some obsolete settings which make it faster/the same speed despite having pre-installed extensions?

Recently, I switched from using tables to using column view for some use cases, and there are many advantages for me in that. What I am missing in column view is hl-line-mode. Sometimes it is difficult for me when being at the far right with the cursor, to see in the far left what line I am in and what values correspondent to the ones in the far right.
 Hl-line-mode is turned on, but it doesn't highlight the current line when in column view. Does anyone of you know of a way to make it work? Thanks in advance for your help!

 Anyone knows why Scala behaves this way? Or if this is indeed objectively a wart or it is a subjective thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Emacs community,
 I am trying to recreate the RStudio layout for the ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics) mode. This is I want to improve the ESS module in doom (here it is the feature branch).
 I have made good progress, but I'm currently stuck on one aspect.
 Here's the code I have so far:
 (defun my-rstudio-layout () "" (interactive) (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist `("^\\*help\\[R\\]" (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (slot . 1) (window-width . 0.33) (reusable-frames . nil))) (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist `("^\\*xwidget-webkit*." (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (slot . 1) (window-width . 0.33) (reusable-frames . nil))) (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist `("^\\*R.*\\*" (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-at-bottom) (window-width . 0.5) (dedicated . t))) (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist `("^\\*R dired\\*" (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (slot . -1) (window-width . 0.33) (reusable-frames . nil))) (let ((ess-startup-directory 'default-directory) (ess-ask-for-ess-directory nil)) (delete-other-windows) (ess-switch-to-ESS t) (ess-help "help") (ess-rdired))) 
 My problem is with the xwidget buffer. I would like it to open in the same window as the help buffer, using a tab (activating tab-bar-mode, of course). 
 I aim to achieve something similar to this: https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/images/RStudio_Screenshot_Labels.png
 Would anyone know how I could achieve this? I've been struggling to figure out how because the manual isn't clear about what variables we can use in the display-buffer-alist. 
 Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance! 
 PS. Any other suggestions or hints about this function are also appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 To preface, I am brand new to emacs and am currently exploring what it has to offer. I setup a simple init.el file like so:
 ``` ;; Set up package.el to work with MELPA (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
 ;; Download Evil (unless (package-installed-p 'evil) (package-install 'evil))
 ;; Download Catppuccin (unless (package-installed-p 'catppuccin-theme) (package-install 'catppuccin-theme))
 ;; Enable Evil (require 'evil) (evil-mode 1)
 ;; Enable Catppuccin (load-theme 'catppuccin :no-confirm) (setq catppuccin-flavor 'mocha) (catppuccin-reload)
 (custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. '(package-selected-packages '(catppuccin-theme evil))) (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. ) ```
 It works perfectly on Ubuntu running under WSL, it does not quite work on straight Windows 11. On Windows 11 it does set the theme to Catppuccin so I know it's sourcing the init.el file correctly but it evil mode doesn't start working until after I manually toggle it via (M-x evil-mode)
 Also, if it makes a difference, I am using 28.2 on both WSL and straight Windows. 
 It's just a minor inconvenience but if there is something I am missing that will fix it then I am all ears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I have upgraded my emacs to 29 from 28 and got a lot of packages complaining after fresh download from elpa. I use custom emacs with doom theme and lots of other packages, namely counsel, ivy, lsp, projectile, some minor ones. Suddenly, lsp started to complain a lot with warnings, projectile stopped running my projects with qemu (but pure terminal works), a lot of other problems -- warnings in different packages. What are the basic steps I need to check after an upgrade? Yes, I have downloaded all packages from scratch but problems are still there.
 Right now, the most annoying thing is the way I run qemu with tun/tap interface enabled. If I run from separate console, my project starts as expected. If I run it as a command for projectile/run, qemu cannot open tap interface (resource is busy). Manual check of env in console/projectile does not show any significant differences.
 Edit: a bit more details

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The previous tree-sitter package was just a minor mode, and this made it much easier to migrate to and use. Having a new major mode means that all hooks, key-bindings, major-mode checks, use-package’s, derived modes, and config need to be duplicated twice. And it's not only your own user config, but all packages need to add support for each new mode, even if they don't care about tree-sitter. 
 Given that, the core developers must have had good reasons for not going the minor-mode route. Does anyone know some of the trade-offs that were considered? Maybe a link to the Devel discussion about it?

 Ah! Nice~ We can replace the placeholder _. Let's take advantage of vector's self-quotation:
 lisp (#1=#[257 "\211\300U\203\0\301\207\211\302S!_\207" [0 1 #1#] 4] 5) ;; => 120

 However, I usually don't notice until I compile the file, which tells me that I have a n or p somewhere and have to track it down, and there's not always a line number. 
 If I use I-search-forwards these accidentally inserted characters are hard to track down, because there are so many legitimate uses of n and p
 Does anyone have any ideas on a way to make catching these rascals easier?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like this is probably down to me not being too good with lisp, so maybe someone can point out my error. The idea is, that i want to create an svg-tag (Package), that opens a URL on click. That's the part i've got working. But now, the tag itself should be part of the url, which i can't get to work.
 So, this works
  (setq svg-tag-tags ("\\(ASGUPD\-[#0-9]+\\)" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag)) (lambda () (interactive) (browse-url "https://jira.internal.de/browse/")) "Open in Browser")) )) 
 But this doesn't
  (setq svg-tag-tags ("\\(ASGUPD\-[#0-9]+\\)" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag)) (lambda (tag) (interactive) (browse-url (concat "https://jira.internal.de/browse/" tag))) "Open in Browser")) )) 
 This is what i have come up with so far. When running this i get the Error
  Wrong number of arguments: (lambda (tag) (interactive) (browse-url (concat "https://elara-jira.elara-gmbh.de/browse/" tag))), 0 
 I'm not sure if the tag is even available at that point. I assumed that it would work the same as creating the tag. Am i doing something obviously wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In order to have a more comfortable keyboard layout I've switched the Crtl key with the Alt key and Alt with Win-logo key using xmodmap. This makes transitioning between my Ubuntu desktop and Macbook pretty seemless and doesn't kill my little finger. ;)
 In Emacs 27 this worked fine, Emacs 29 thinks I'm hitting multiple keys when pressing Alt or Win-logo.
 Alt+x should be C-x but I get A-C-x
 Win-logo+x should be: M-x but is M-s-x 
 How can I fix this?
 My init.el has these changes to make it work in previous versions of emacs:
 ;; xfce key-bindings
 (setq x-meta-keysym 'super
 x-super-keysym 'meta)
 ;; use fn key as control, maps better to my dasKeyboard setup
 (setq ns-function-modifier 'control)
 This is the content of my .xmodmap file:
 clear control
 clear mod1
 clear mod4
 keycode 133 = Super_L
 keycode 64 = Alt_L
 keycode 37 = Control_L
 remove control = Control_L
 remove mod4 = Super_L
 remove mod1 = Alt_L
 add control = Alt_L
 add mod1 = Super_L
 add mod4 = Control_L

 Funny how that is....emacs user wants nuanced control. Are there any existing packages or easy elisp to enable this type of function? Was low key hoping it would work with C-u C-c C-o but that was a no go.

 The TL;DR is as follows.
 My capture templates usually end with \n%?. That is intended to position point on a new line in the capture buffer, ready for me to type in whatever text I want. And it has always done exactly that. However, what I now see is that where I have a template that clocks in, AND if I am storing clock info in a drawer, then that positioning goes awry. Instead of point being positioned at the start of a new line, it is placed right on top of the clock drawer. That forces me to manually move the cursor down before starting to type.

Even if you were to use sed or awk to make the passcmd work with .authinfo (to avoid duplicating the password), you will not be using the emacs interface promot to enter the password but gpg’s.
 Here is what i’ve been doing instead, I’ve this elisp function;
 (require 'auth-source) (defun salih/get-mail-password () (let* ((auth-info (auth-source-search :host "mail.gmx.com" :require '(:user :secret))) (password (funcall (plist-get (car auth-info) :secret)))) password)) 
 It will return the password associated with the host. If the file is encrypted you are promoted to enter your passphrase with epa.
 Since I run emacs as a daemon, we can eval this function in the command line like this emacsclient -e "(let ((inhibit-message t)) (salih/get-mail-password))" you will be promoted in the emacs session you are running.
 If you run this in a shell it is going to return the password with double quotes, but we can workaround that using simple string substitution in the shell. here is the final script;
 #!/usr/bin/env sh output="$(emacsclient -e "(let ((inhibit-message t)) (salih/get-mail-password))")" output_without_quotes="${output//\"/}" echo "$output_without_quotes"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 Any reason why Emacs would not detect packages when I list them but they are visible under melpa package listing: Example is "dirvish" package that does not list in Emacs but it's visible on Melpa site.
 My config for packages is
 (setq package-archives
 '(("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
 ("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
 ("gnu-devel" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/")
 ("nongnu" . "https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/")
 ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
 ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")))
 ​
 (package-initialize)
 (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents))
 (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
 ​
 ; Unless "use-package" is installed, install "use-package"
 (package-install 'use-package))
 ​
 (require 'use-package)
 (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
 ​
 Wonder if I'm missing something or perhaps the order of packages is wrong ? 
 ​
 Thank you

When I select a piece of text with the mouse in Org mode and then press 'M-w' to copy the text, Emacs successfully copies the text, but the highlighted selection remains in an odd color that doesn't go away, almost like it was highlighted in yellow or some other unusual color. I'm unsure of the cause of this issue, and it's difficult to reproduce as it only happens occasionally. I'm not sure what might be causing it. Have you ever experienced anything like this? do you know what it might be linked to so I can tweak my Emacs config?

 So I’m new to haskell so please bear with me for this silly question. I was doing some haskell using GHC 9.2.7 installed by ghcup. Then today I installed and set ghc 9.6.2 and cabal 3.10.1.0 and my simple toy programs don’t work anymore because libraries such as Data.Map are not found anymore.
 I thought they were part of the prelude? What am I missing? 
 Also follow up question: why is ghcup recommending me old versions of compiler and tools instead of the latest one? I’m using ubuntu 18.04 of that helps
 Thanks a lot to however take the time to help me :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So org transclusion lets you display/link sections of other org files into your current file and it updates in real time. 
 I'm loving it in general for text that sort of "lives on" but I have a use case in my productivity system where I want to transclude from a file I use every week but it changes. So I need to embed the transclusion as a part of my end of week review. 
 Currently I have to:
  
Delete the transclusion
 Go to the running weekly tracking file
 copy/refile it into my 5 daily files that are long term stored 
 delete it from the running weekly tracking file. 
  
What I would like to be able to do i.e. a sort of baking in of the source to everywhere it is linked. 
  
Go to the source of the transclusion
 search for the use of this heading as a transclusion across my org files
 overwrite the transclusion with the actual text. 
  
Before I go writing the custom elisp for this which seems like a bear. I wanted to confirm if anyone knows a simple way to achieve this.

 Here's the code
 Any comments or critiques are welcome! I do have a few specific areas for feedback:
  
When inserting a State function in the StateT function, I have to use something like
 (a,s) <- runState f <$> get
 put s
 
 which seems very clunky. Is there a better pattern to use?
  
I couldn't figure out a clean way for hands that are split to disqualify from being blackjacks. Any ideas?
 
I'm not super fluent in testing. How do I test IO portions of the code? Such as my function Actions.getValidTurnActions which requires the user to input a line.
 
 Thanks for taking a look at a beginner's code. Much appreciated!

 Recently left Spacemacs in favour of rolling my own config for a variety of reasons. It took me a few weeks to put together. There were a lot of people that said, "you can just put something together in the space of a weekend"; that was very much NOT the case for me, having gotten used to functionality from Spacemacs, and also wanting certain things.
 Anyway, this is the first time I've put something like this together, and I'd love if anyone felt like taking a look and offering some criticisms/insights.

 My probelm is this return an Option of my result that i cant manipulate. I was under the impression thta I could use a recover, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Is there a way of returning an error if one of the value ends up empty ?

 If my mouse pointer is over my lsp buffer then keyboard chords using lsp-keymap-prefix fail. In this video you will see my mouse near to the cursor. I hit C-l (my prefix) then shift and it bugs out with mouse movement errors. If I do the exact same thing with the mouse NOT over the buffer it works. This is both with and without lsp-ui-doc-mode on.
 Has anyone witnessed anything similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to have a "mix" between avy-goto-char-timer (which at the moment is the only thing I use from avy as it's so great) and avy-goto-char-in-line, where the search scope is the current line. That is, I often need to jump somewhere in the current line, and I wish to type until the match is unique, at which point the jump should be performed automatically (like the former command already does). I could just use avy-goto-char-timer, but it would show all other matches in the buffer, so making it unique is harder and sometimes impossible, so I have to press the target key(s).
 Looking at the implementations, I'm a bit stuck though, as avy-goto-char-in-line uses avy-jump for scoping, which is based on regexes, but avy-goto-char-timer gets the candidate list with avy--read-candidates, where I don't see how I would scope to the current line (and which looks harder to extend, as it's quite complex). Is there an easy way I'm overlooking?

 This is the code I have, which kind of works:
 ;; Comment syntax: <# #> denotes a multi-line comment (modify-syntax-entry ?\< "< 1" st) (modify-syntax-entry ?\# ". 23b" st) (modify-syntax-entry ?\> "> 4" st) 
 It successfully comments out the lines
 <# This is a multi-line comment #> 
 But unfortunately also comments out the 10 in $x < 10.
 I have not been able to find any good examples in either the documentation or SO, but the documentation on syntax tables seems to indicate this would be the correct approach.

 Take c-mode for example:
  
References to c-mode-hook.
 Key bindings that reference c-mode-map.
 use-package references to c-mode.
 My own functions that check: (member major-mode '(c-mode c++-mode objc-mode))
 Basically my whole configuration assumes C/C++ use c-mode or c++-mode and having to add checks for c-ts-mode is a hassle, enough that I don't use c-ts-mode at all.
  
Is there some solution that doesn't involve every check for c-mode also checking for c-ts-mode ?

Understandable. Now I dont know the ins and outs of that complexity but certainly my use case would be simplified if consult-buffer could be configured to ignore the longer path so I dont open that file via the long path and the buffer indeed has a reference of ~/symlink/file.txt. eg see here , a picture makes it easier to understand : I'd like to see one or the other filtered so I can have some concistency in my buffer opening.
 Can anything be done or is there something already available? Or do I just need to suck it up and be more careful as to what path I use?

 let this be the HTTP request I'm trying to highlight:
 GET /print_hello_world HTTP/2.0 host: mydomain.com te: trailers sec-fetch-site: cross-site sec-fetch-mode: no-cors sec-fetch-dest: image accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br accept-language: en-US,en;q=0.5 accept: image/avif,image/webp,*/* {"hello" :"world"} 
 now in the first line want to highlight the first line GET with a face and the endpoint /print_hello_world with another face I tried using:
 (setq font-lock-defaults '(,((rx line-start (or "GET" "POST") symbol-start (one-or-more (any alphanumeric punct)) symbol-end space) . 'my-http-endpoint-font) ,((rx line-start symbol-start (or "GET" "POST") symbol-end) . 'my-http-method-font))) 
 but this will only highlight the method not the endpoint.
 the same goes for header values, I tried using this:
 (setq font-lock-defaults '((,(rx line-start symbol-start (one-or-more (any alphanumeric ?- ?_)) symbol-end ": ") . 'my-http-header-key-face ) (,(rx ": " symbol-start (one-or-more not-newline) symbol-end eol) . 'my-http-header-value-face ))) 
 this will highlight only the header with its face but not the value.
 I tried to check python-mode for how it is done but I didn't understand how it is structuring it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I use emacs in client/server mode by running emacs --daemon --nw at login and then running emacsclient -c to open new frames.
 After upgrading Arch linux this morning to emacs 29.1, my clients can no longer find the socket to connect to emacs. The daemon command runs and outputs the usual startup messages, but it's like it doesn't finish loading fully and never executes the daemon.
 I tried emacs -q --daemon --nw and this worked, so the problem is in my init somewhere. Ugh.
 I tried --debug-init but it found no problems. The only output I get in Messages is:
 Error loading autoloads: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory /home/alanm/.emacs.d/elpa/yaml-mode-20230714.440/yaml-mode-autoloads) Loading /home/alanm/.emacs.d/orgmode_customizations.el (source)...done Loading /home/alanm/.emacs.d/email.el (source)...done Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode...done For information about GNU Emacs and the GNU system, type C-h C-a. Package cl is deprecated 
 I'm not sure what is trying to load cl. It's nowhere in my config, and the only cl- packages I have installed show as builtins. Not sure what's up with yaml-mode, but I don't think that's it because the problem was happening before I updated yaml. I've also tried commenting out my orgmode and email external .el files, and that didn't help, so the issue is in the init file directly.
 I can run server-start in an emacs window and then connect, but I'd like to have a background daemon running instead.
 Any ideas? Here is my init.el, if it helps: https://pastebin.com/GNzhwcqU

I'm gun shy on just upgrading emacs ala brew because I don't wind to wind up going down the "fix up" rabbit hole when I'm trying to get work done... so looking here for someone to tell me the latest brew emacs is all good for the latest mac before I take the plunge.
 (I was so happy emacs was getting tamed, really wasn't expecting this kind of interaction... is this common on mac os upgrades?)
 Thanks for any info or tips. (I'm trying to stay as vanilla as possible in my emacs setup).
 ​
 EDIT: After googling around I found mention of this being fixed in the 29 branch. But also found a one liner fix to avoid upgrading in flow. So, for anyone else hitting this:
 (add-to-list 'image-types 'svg)
 will do the trick.

 ​
 ​
 I come from Rmarkdown, trying to reproduce some of my previous workflow. I made most everything the way I wanted. However, I like to keep html reports from my analyses, in rmarkdown I would generate standalone html files, ie, they dont point to png plots outside of the file, the plots are embedded in the html.
 ​
 - Is there a way to do this in orgmode export? So that the resulting html is including the plots, instead of pointing to the files locally?
 ​
 Thank you!

 Do you have any experience? How you implemented your Zettelkasten? And how you synchronize among different systems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Like many of you I am upgrading my init.el to emacs 29.1
 To be able to bind C-i differently from <tab> in GUI, I had the following snippet, it works. But I have never properly understood how/why
 (define-key input-decode-map "\C-i" [C-i]) (global-set-key [C-i] (lambda()(interactive)(message "Ctrl + I"))) 
 Now, define-key is flagged as obsolete, replaced by keymap-set.
 However I can't seem to make the same lines work with keymap-set. I have tried replacing [C-i] by "<C-i>" since (kbd "<C-i">) returns [C-i], but it does not pass the is-valid-key-p check.
 Any key-binding guru here, ready to settle the matter and help me and others understand the proper way to achieve this with the new API ?
 I know I could leave it as is, or rebind stuff to Hyper-I, but that's not a satisfying answer
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, can anyone help me choose between neovim and emacs? I know what I want from an editor and am ready to spend a lot of time customizing one of these editors, but I don't want to do it twice. So I will tell my preferences and it would be really great to get your advice.
  
I prefer to use an editor in terminal, without additional gui. As far as I know neovim is tui app, while emacs is not. However, I can run emacs in my terminal. How much I lost not using gui version of emacs?
 
I want to create and edit notes and to-do's using an editor. I am not going to use it as a calendar as I prefer to use apple calendar on my macbook and iphone. How many advantages does org-mode have over simple md? Also I've read about org-mode for neovim...
 
I want to try to use an editor as ide too. I'm angular developer and I'm working on rather large project (main project contains about 7k files). I'm worried about the performance of the autocomplete. Unfortunately, I failed to find ready-made configs for emacs and neovim to open the project and see for myself.
 
I definitely don't want to use my editor as browser, gaming platform, email client, window manager etc etc. Honestly, looks like neovim is winner here :)
 
I don't want to use something like spacemacs, emacs-doom, etc., just self-written configs. And I don't know what is better in this case - elisp or lua/vimscript.
 
I have no preference between emacs or vim hotkeys. Both are good.
 
Emacs startup time is significantly worse than neovim's, even though I have very few plugins installed. Can I fix it without using client-server? It's not a big problem, but it's annoying.
 
 So i'm looking for a lightweight and fast editor for notes and development on angular. Should I spend my time on emacs or neovim? Thanks for your opinion and sorry for my english, I'm not native.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Currently I have been working on a springboot groovy project. Sadly intellij is used for most of the stuff here. I was trying to explore gettting lsp up with eglot and groovy-language-server. Language server is not able to detect other files in the project.
 My settings are 
 (use-package eglot
 :ensure t
 :defer t
 :config
 (setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024))
 (push :documentHighlightProvider eglot-ignored-server-capabilities)
 ;;Adding groovy server
 (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs \(groovy-mode . ( ,local-java11-path "-jar" ,(expand-file-name (concat local-abs-config-path local-abs-custom-utils "groovy-language-server/groovy-language-server-all.jar")))))`
 )
 ​
 Please recommend how can i get syntax check and some language completion in emacs for springboot and groovy.
 Thanks

 I was using linum-mode in my Emacs 28. But when I upgraded to 29.1, this function was gone.
 I found a function called line-number-mode, which has no visible effect.
 Then I found display-line-numbers-mode, which seems to have the same effect as the old linum-mode.
 Why there are so many line number related functions and which one should I use?

I have added dap-mode and enabled dap and dap-ui.
 
Then I wrote a tiny .js file and tried debugging it in VSCode and it worked. VSCode even created .vscode/launch.json for me.
 
Then, I tried dap-node-setup which has failed, because it tried to download deprecated version of vscode extension: https://open-vsx.org/api/ms-vscode/node-debug2/latest/
 
I searched through dap-mode repo and found this issue #554, and this comment with instructions, but they are still for the old version of the extension.
 
I tried following the steps but using the newer version of extension at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug
 
I extracted the content of .vsix file into ~/.emacs.d/.local/cache/.extension/vscode/ms-vscode.js-debug-companion
 
I think I just need to set dap-node-debug-path (pointing to that dir) and lastly, set dap-node-debug-program. And here I think where I'm failing. I'm not sure to which file in the directory to point it to.
 
 Does anyone know how to set up dap-mode debugging for node.js?

 http://textfiles.com/programming/vivsemacs.txt
 ​
  
ABSTRACT: The editors vi and emacs were compared using a simple time-based experimental method involving common text manipulations and a post- test opinion survey by questionnaire. The subjects were twelve students; six were novices and six were regular users. Significant objective performance differences were confined to the novice users; here emacs consistently outperformed vi with respect to time taken to perform the tasks and the amount of help needed. Subjectively, novices preferred emacs because of its more predictable nature. Emacs was therefore the editor of choice for the novice users tested. There appears to be no advantage for a regular user of one editor to switch to the other.

 Anyway, I've been interested in FP for a while and have naturally come across the STG paper by SLP Jones from 1992. This paper cites a lot of older works, such as the spineless G-machine, the G-machine, TIM, ABC etc.
 I find it really interesting to look through these other, older abstract machines preceding the STG machine but the thing is: is there anything succeeding the STGM? Or is it truly undefeated in its design for 30 years?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to implement bijective type level function that would work like UnHKD (a :: f Int, b :: f String) (a :: Int, b :: String) in purescript.
 First approach I thought about is to define it directly over records:
 class UnHKD :: Row Type -> Row Type -> Constraint class UnHKD t t' | t -> t', t' -> t instance ( R.Cons label (f a) as' as , R.Cons label a bs' bs , UnHKD as' bs' ) => UnHKD as bs else instance UnHKD r r 
 However, it doesn't work:
 check :: Unit check = toProve -- error: type class instance for `Prim.Row.Cons t2 (t3 t4) t5 t0` is possibly infinite. where toProve :: UnHKD () () => Unit toProve = unit 
 The second approach was to use RowLists. However, type inference was lost. Probably because RowToList is not bijective:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've noticed that Emacs 29 comes with a useful function called duplicate-line that duplicates the current line. Surprisingly, it's not bound to any key by default. To make it more accessible, I decided to bind it to the key combination C-S-d (Control-Shift-d). I was able to achieve this by using the following command in my Emacs configuration:
 (keymap-global-set "C-S-d" 'duplicate-line) 
 It works but I'm not sure if it's the proper way to do this, though.

 I have a string with html content I want to propertize using html-mode so I basically do this:
 (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*temp-buffer*") (erase-buffer ) (html-mode) (insert "<html><body><h1>hi there</h1></body></html>") (buffer-substring (point-min ) (point-max))) 
 the output I receive after running this code is this:
 #("<html><body><h1>hi there</h1></body></html>" 0 43 (fontified nil)) 
 but when I go to the buffer interactively and run
 (buffer-substring (point-min ) (point-max)) 
 in eval-expression I got a html text with properties.
 what I'm missing in the non-interactive code? also if there is a better method for this please share .
 thanks in advance.

A PKM is defined as follows:
Personal knowledge management - Wikipedia
Alternative Definitions and Roles
An alternative definition for Personal Knowledge Management would be to define a PKM by its use. Looking at the definition of a Zettelkasten, we have:
Zettelkasten.de.
Using these definitions, we can conclude that there are two fundamental types of PKM:
In other words:
The PKM based on networked thoughts could be considered as an 'Active PKM'. Its purpose being the generation of emergent ideas, and
The Organisational PKM could be considered as a 'Passive PKM' for the archiving and retrieval of facts.]]></summary>

For example, if I write "example" somewhere in a document, I would like it pops up automatically when I start writing "exa". I have Corfu-global-mode corfu-pop-up mode and Corfu-history enabled.
 However, this popup suggestion works perfectly on org-mode! For any other modes, it just does not work. It would be very helpful to get it to work for other modes, especially for Latex mode and Python mode!
 Please let me know. Thanks a lot for your help.
 Here is my config for corfu: ``` (use-package corfu :custom (corfu-cycle t) ; Allows cycling through candidates (corfu-auto t) ; Enable auto completion (corfu-auto-prefix 2) (corfu-auto-delay 0.1) (corfu-popupinfo-delay '(0.4 . 0.2)) (corfu-preview-current 'insert) ; Do not preview current candidate (corfu-preselect-first nil) (corfu-on-exact-match nil) ; Don't auto expand tempel snippets
 :bind (:map corfu-map ("M-SPC" . corfu-insert-separator) ("TAB" . corfu-next) ([tab] . corfu-next) ("S-TAB" . corfu-previous) ([backtab] . corfu-previous) ("S-<return>" . nil) ;; leave my entry as it is ("RET" . corfu-insert)) :init (global-corfu-mode) (corfu-history-mode) (corfu-popupinfo-mode) ; Popup completion info )

 One of his books is called Grokking Simplicity, an introduction to Functional Programming, and I'm wondering where his formulations and definitions of functional programming are incorrect, at least from a Haskeller point of view.
 ​
 A lot of these formulations are pretty accessible; i.e, in functional programming, you have a separate notion of actions (effects), computation, and values, but I'm worried that they might not be correct in a Haskell context. Any opinions on Grokking Simplicity?

 Almost a year ago I wrote an article describing my note-taking process here (linked from the InternetArchive because I inadvertently changed/removed some stuff on my site). I got a lot of messages from people suggesting I open-source what I had worked on, so here I am.
 I don't have much any knowledge wrt submitting packages into Melpa (let alone being able to test what I've done locally), so I'm asking /r/emacs for support. Without jumping too deeply into googling myself out of my own ignorance, I found this article, but it wasn't completely helpful. So here are my main question(s):
  
How can I test that my package rolodex.el works before I submit a PR to the Melpa repo?
 What other things am I missing (README aside, I still wanna write that)?
  
Here's my code if anyone wants to take a gander: rolodex.org
 It's still early(ish) in its development, but it should work (at least the original code works in my init file), so it shouldn't be judged as complete. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am experiencing a fairly common issue using GNU Screen in conjunction with Emacs. In short, out of the box, Screen does not seem to support italic fonts when used with a standard terminal, e.g. xterm. Since lots of recent Emacs packages use italics, e.g. Marginalia, this is quite annoying. Without italics support, Screen places some ugly underlines to highlight text.
 A way to check italics support is to run chinfocmp -1 | grep -E 'ritm|sitm'. When run inside Screen, the output is empty. When run without Screen, the output is not empty. I have not found a $TERM value that uses standard termcap or terminfo database entries that fixes this issue inside Screen.
 What is your setup for running Emacs inside Screen with good italics support? Related: https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=36676

Kickstart.nvim is not a distribution.
 Kickstart.nvim is a template for your own configuration. The goal is that you can read every line of code, top-to-bottom, understand what your configuration is doing, and modify it to suit your needs.
 Once you've done that, you should start exploring, configuring and tinkering to explore Neovim!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[>>> indent-bars <<<
 There are many indentation guide packages out there, but I found most to be slow and inflexible. Plus I wanted to try out the idea of drawing vertical bars using font-lock and the :stipple face attribute.
 The result is indent-bars. Ultra-fast. Highly configurable — from barely-there to editor-flexing bling. With all the features you'd expect (all optional naturally):
  
color-blending for dialing in just the right level of glanceability vs. intrusiveness
 indentation depth-based coloring
 current depth highlighting (with zero speed cost + many possible styles)
 blank line support
  
Important note: I learned that apparently not all Emacsen properly support :stipple (despite happily accepting it as a face attribute). Linux/UNIX is safe, emacs-mac supports it on MacOS, but Windows may not at all (untested). Also, terminal emacs does not (to my knowledge) implement :stipple. Let me know how you fare.

 Does anyone know if there is any way to display them in such a "daily timeline" grid?
 SOLVED: the reason it didn't appear is due to the SCHEDULED: "property" (not really a property) added automatically by the org-schedule command. Removing it brought the tasks back to the grid.
 no \"daily timeline\" (grid)
 none of the repeated tasks display in the \"grid\"

 I have very little knowledge of emacs and what I am trying to do is to map the keysequence "C-u 1 C-c |" in orgmode to a key in evil mode.
 "C-c |" is bound to org-table-create-or-convert-from-region, so I tried this:
 (general-evil-define-key '(normal visual) org-mode-map :prefix "SPC" "t" (lambda() (interactive) (org-table-create-or-convert-from-region '(1))) ) 
 But now when I select a region and press SPC-t (which should trigger this mapping) all I get is the the error message "this should not happen" from emacs...
 I have no clue what this is supposed to mean, so my questions are:
 1) Why is this error message produced and what does it mean?
 2) What is the proper way to do the keymapping?
 Many thanks!

 It's based on code I worked on at Wire, rewritten in Scala 3.3 and updated to take advantage of new syntax, and also it uses Rob Norris' typename microlib for finding names for types.
 Inject is available already on Maven Central, but also you can just copy-paste the source code - it's just one file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Having encountered Haskell for the first time back in 2019, I've been developing with it and off since then and even contributing to open source projects. It's been a phenomenal, intellectually rewarding journey and it's by far my favourite programming language.
 However, I've reached a point in my Haskell journey where I feel like I should either put it on the side and learn other things, or continue with it, but on a more narrower, specialized path. 
 I know Haskell is a general purpose programming language and can be used to solve any programming problem, but so are other programming languages such as Python or C/++. 
 But I can't help but feel that since Haskell is unique, it must have a domain that it uniquely excels in. 
 What does r/haskell think this domain is? I really want to continue learning and mastering Haskell, but I need a sense of direction.
 Thanks.

 (org-heading-components) returns heading components without extracting statistics cookies such as [1/1] or [50%].
 The goal would be to cut them out of the cookie heading string (nth 4 (org-heading-components)) and save them in a separate list. What could be a good solution?
 Any ideas?

 I've spent over 20 hours trying to solve it already so any help/suggestions would be really appreciated. Not sure if it's org-image-overlay or evaluation of (org-element-property :begin el) that yields that nil. Doom Emacs.

I'd love to find some sort of package that lets me have a queue of contacts that I can configure to give me two or three people to write to or call each week, as scheduled org-mode TODOs. Extra bonus would be if I can assign some sort of approximate frequency or weight to contacts, like once a month, every 3 months, once a year, and so on. Does anyone know of something like this that already exists?

 If a function, that is written in an end recursive form (so doesn't leave any tmp variables / operations on the stack), called unto itself via ex. curry / uncurry (and friends) still end recursive as the stack frame changes into that currying function? So basically does haskell (the compiler) undestand that function as still end recursive or not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not strictly an emacs question, but I feel like emacs users are the primary users of Super key bindings. I'm forced to use a Mac for work, and primarily remote display Emacs through x2go and Xquartz. I can't figure out how to bind a key to Super. By default, option is used for Meta, but command key combos seems to send international characters to emacs rather than get recognized as a modifier. When I'm running locally on the Mac, `(setq mac-command-modifier 'super)` works, but since my remote emacs isn't running on MacOS this has no effect. As far as I can tell, Super doesn't show up in Xquartz configuration at all. Is this just a missing feature I'm going to have to live with? 
 And if you're wondering why I don't just run locally and use TRAMP, I am doing a lot of python debugging, dap-mode with debugpy is a vastly superior debugging environment to gud-pdb, and dap-mode is broken on TRAMP.

 I can access to the internet, cannot use usb slot, nor run .exe files, do not have virtual environments, is out of question I can speak now with the manager to ask to review the policies. Apart from this not positive side, I like the institution a lot from an etical point of view.

 Is this possible? What would be the pain points? Would it bring value to anyone else?
 I guess the descriotion would have to be of the kind {desc}-{last-update}, with {desc} being freely adaptable...
 It would help in my case to overview what needs to be updated (I have also some kind of 'meta' notes with many links )

Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

How to prevent GHC from inferring types with undesirable constraints by Nicolas Frisby
For a broad class of domain-specific constraints/languages, this is the first technique I’ve learned of that enables custom compile-time error messages in the particularly insidious scenario where the user’s mistake incurs polymorphism that the library author did not intend.
Lazy Layout by Jasper Van der Jeugt
Tumblr in particular has a fairly nice way to do photo sets, where these can be organised in rows and columns. I wanted to see if I could mimic this in a recursive way, where rows and columns can be subdivided further.

GHC Steering Committee seeks input from industrial Haskell users by David Christiansen

The Haskell Foundation’s Stability Working Group thinks that this can solve a real need: teams of Haskell developers will be able to more easily understand the status of extensions and express machine-checked policies for CI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some users were reporting problems when trying to set up notifications for scheduled org-mode tasks. I couldn't find many examples for doom emacs, which got me slightly concerned.
 Does anyone have any configuration or advice for choosing the right package (org-notifications, org-alert, org-wild-notifier, org-timed-alerts) for setting it up? The end goal I expected to be standard system notifications (e.g. notify-send) that you could configure to appear 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day before a scheduled event.
 UPDATE1: It appears that org-alert isn't working out of the box and requires some extra configuration - it is necessary to make org-notifications work.
 UPDATE2: seems that by default org-alert outputs to message buffer. Adding (setq alert-default-style 'libnotify) seems to have solved it.
 UPDATE3: looks it shouldn't be necessary. org-notifications should set alerting style to libnotify already when running (org-notifications-start), so adding it to (after! org... ) block should be enough (hopefully).
 UPDATE4: above doesn't work. If anyone figured it out please let me know.

Currently, it shows up in a horizontal split, with the previous buffer occupying the top half of the screen and the selected agenda item taking the bottom part. This behavior is annoying to me, and I want it to behave like the C-x 1 command, which opens the selected item in a full buffer. I'm not sure which setting I need to modify to get the desired result.

 Can I make similar bindings for emacs as well? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I developed this "baby Haskell" app — only simple coding and 329 lines including comments. I've been using it for nearly a decade. It last worked fine in 2020. Well, now I can't get it running on either current MacOS or Ubuntu:
 https://github.com/public-law/oregon-law-parser
 It's a pure Stack setup. I've tried many techniques using ghcup, different versions of Stack and GHC... The closest I could get is all the tests passing on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, but it reinstalls GHC 8.0.2 every time it runs the tests. (!)
 If this will take more than just a minute or two, I'm happy to pay for someone's time — have tests passing so I can further develop it and use it. For a stretch goal, I'd love it to develop it easily on my Mac with VS Code — so, running on the current recommended ghcup, hls, and ghc, all on Mac silicon. 
 If this works out, I'm open to the person who gets this working again doing the new dev required — test and use it with the latest Oregon laws.
 Thanks in advance!

 I'm thinking in making something that is very composable and easy to use through do-notation, in order to achieve tasks like completion through an LLM, creating and storing embeddings, analyzing pictures and audio, etc.
 All of this abstracted in some kind of interface (MTL, Free Monad and friends, or whatever other thing)
 Given that GHC can generate Wasm and we can make mobile apps with Reflex, one could be able to use these things in any platform easily.
 Does that sound appealing? (I mean, ignoring the shit ton of absurd hype there's around ChatGPT, just focusing on the utility of a cohesive AI ecosystem in Haskell)

 I'd like to be able to be able to use it with WAI and a lightweight framework, like Twain, but I'm not sure how to integrate it.
 Using the Twain README snippet as an example (see below), how could I adapt the usage of ResponderM so I can instead use the Eff monad. This would allow me to use the builtin effects like Reader, etc.
 Also, is there a better way to access a reader environment? Should the environment go in the WAI Request's Vault instead of trying to use a different monad? The library moved to using vault instead of a TwainM and RouteM monad which reminded me of Scotty.
 Thanks.

It is triggered just by normal typing, on every new list, like in the schreenshot above. The same backtrace was also triggered when I opened the parameter list for the function definition, while I was typing "array" as the first parameter.
 Any idea what am I doing wrong? Do I need to enable/disable something, or is it just a bug? 
 I have built Emacs from the current git master: GNU Emacs 30.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, cairo version 1.17.8) of 2023-07-24, so I am on the edge, with other words, might be Emacs bug as well :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This release adds BigInt/BigDecimal support and a way to create zero-overhead new types.
 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library bringing type constraints to Scala. You can attach predicates to type and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive = 5 val y: Int :| Positive = -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] = -5.refineEither //Left("...") 
 Check the README for further information.
 Main changes
 Support for BigInt and BigDecimal
 All constraints in io.github.iltotore.iron.constraint.numeric except Infinity and NaN now support BigInt and BigDecimal.
 RefinedTypeOps
 You can add smart constructors to your type aliases using the RefinedTypeOps trait:
 scala type Temperature = Int :| Positive object Temperature extends RefinedTypeOps[Temperature]  scala val temperature: Temperature = Temperature(100) val maybeTemperature: Option[Temperature] = Temperature.option(100) val temperatureOrError: Either[String, Temperature] = Temperature.either(100) 
 Other changes
 You can check the full changelog on GitHub

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 I've settled on learning emacs for my creative writing, and am wondering how I can have a file of my characters open in one buffer at the part describing "Stan", and the same file in another buffer showing the part describing "Loretta" (python fans will understand the choice of names).
 I'm aware I can have different files in different buffers all displayed at once, but I don't really want my dramatis personae broken up into lots of single files. I also want to be able to add to the character descriptions as I'm writing and think of new bits about them and/or change things as I go along and come up with new ideas.
 As I've got a widescreen monitor, I want to be able to have those to one side and the story file open in the middle of my screen with my notes on location in a buffer to the other side. What I've found on YouTube has confused me as I'm failing to apply the information to what I want, and my google-fu appears to have gone down to the Crown for a pint.
 Please help this complete newbie. Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am using doom emacs for rust. When I run compilation or test (with in example rustic-cargo-test) an compilation window opens. When I then go through the errors using next-error, the next error in the compilation window is moved into view, but only its top line. Since rust errors are very descriptive and spawn multiply lines, can I somehow instruct next-error to not only move the next error into view but also move to the top of the compilation window? That way I could see the full error message.
 Thank your for any help :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, 2023-07-26, at 1000 UTC (that's less than 30 minutes from the time of this announcement!) we are streaming the 8th episode of the Haskell Unfolder live on YouTube:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7673JaWXaA&list=PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7&index=8
 Many of Haskell's abstractions come with laws; well-known examples include the Functor type class with the functor laws and the Monad type class with the monad laws, but this is not limited to type classes; for example, lenses come with a set of laws, too. To people without a mathematical background such laws may seem intimidating; how would one even start to think about proving them for our own abstractions? In this episode of The Haskell Unfolder we will discuss examples of these laws, show how to prove them, and discuss common techniques for such proofs, including induction. We will also discuss why these laws matter; what goes wrong when they do not hold?
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks.
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:
 https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder
 And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I'm wondering if anyone can please point me to any Emacs packages for generating random events and tables from Mythic Game Emulator or anything similar.
 Asking since even though random table and random name generator sites exist, it would be a nice workflow to do it in Emacs via a function that spits out the same info in an Org Mode buffer than having to have so many browser tabs open for the same effect.
 It would be even better if it could spit out random scenarios given characters that you provide etc. I know this type of idea is borderline CharGPT but it would be way less daunting and more fun to just have something do this for you for solo players.
 ​
 Thanks!

To me, the problem is that ultimately accuracy still needed to be evaluated by "professional annotators".
I don't know yet what to make of it.
However, I am trying to keep track of AI as a most likely assistant in a literal sense. I am very suspicious:
Manfred Spitzer compares the effect of an ox and a tractor on work performance and health.[62/63][#spitzer2012]
If you harness an ox to the plough, you still have to work hard. You have to walk, steer the plough and so on.
If you hitch a tractor to the plough, you don't have to work at all, you just sit and don't exert yourself physically.
So we can distinguish two ways in which we increase our performance:
we increase the effectiveness of our efforts.
we replace our efforts with the efforts of others.]]></summary>

Yesterday, I posted an approach for a new Emacsen in a conceptual stage and that post was deleted. The concept is to rewrite the C backend with multi-threading support while maintaining full API compatibility with elisp code. The post contained information about working code demonstrating the concept.
 I hope that was some misunderstanding on the mod part. But if this post is deleted, then I'll have my answer.

 ​
 I found Orgzly while looking for an organizer / agenda for my android phone, and it became essential in my everyday routine.
 Sadly, there isn't too much info available on the subject, let alone in spanish.
 So here is a question: I haven't been able to make a notification to work in advance, e.g.: if I set the time for a task at 10 hrs., and the "delay" with a value of -1h, I understand it should trigger a notification at 9, but never did.
 Maybe thers some configuration in my new phone I'm not activating (Pixel 6) or in the app preferences.
 Any help would be appreciated.
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After finding org-roam-ui, I was interested in how that package created a webpage that displayed information from, and interacted with emacs. From what I can tell, org-roam-ui uses simple-httpd and websocket.el to create a webserver which is used to transfer information between the page and emacs. 
 I wanted to see whether I could use that general idea to create a dashboard/launch page for emacs. Ideally, I would be able to make a page which could display my org agenda/calendar in real time, give me buttons for a few commands, display information from my ledger file, and let me search my org and roam directories. 
 I don't have a very good understanding of how this works however, and my limited grasp took me just far enough to create a webpage, start the webserver in emacs, and access the page. I had wanted to start small (maybe a button that runs some arbitrary command or displays a message in emacs) but I don't even know where to start with that. 
 I was wondering whether anyone had any specific resources that might help, or advice as to how I might tackle this? I'm reading more into how webservers work on my own but I'm a little lost.
 Any help would be appreciated!

This means that emacs tries to save its state, and recover it on start up. This does not work reliably at present in Android emacs: Android may terminate emacs at any moment, and that may leave an inconsistent saved state.
 Until someone comes up with a solution for this, it is important to disable desktop-save-mode. So add the following to the user (local) part of the start-up file(s):
 (desktop-save-mode -1)
 In spacemacs that is in ~/.spacemacs dotspacemacs/user-config()
 In purcell that is in ~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-local.el
 The emacs variable desktop-save-mode should then be nil after startup.

 And then kill each line one by one with C-k when I look at my kill-ring with browse-kill-ring I have the expected:
 3. Third Item ------- 2. Second Item ------- 1. First Item 
 But then if I yank with C-y I get back 3. Third Item but now my kill-ring looks like:
 3. Third Item ------- 3. Third Item ------- 2. Second Item ------- 1. First Item 
 And so when I then immediately call yank-pop with M-y , instead of getting 2. Second Item I again just see the third item, and I always need to call yank-pop three times to actually start getting back into the kill-ring.
 I am running fairly vanilla Emacs, with no packages shadowing the yank/kill commands. Could anyone help explain why this happens, or anything I should look into to change so that I get what I imagine should be the expected behaviour where C-y gives me the third item, but then M-y should replace that with the second item and one more M-y would give me the first?
 Thanks a lot for any help / suggestions?

 Does it mean property line?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example, lazy evaluation makes debugging different from eager evaluated languages. At some specific points of a program, many expressions maybe partially evaluated. I suspect there should be something like call stack for function, but for partially evaluated expressions.
 Hence there should be some improvement to everyday's debugger. But I'm not familiar with this. 
 If you have anything in mind, please bring it up here. It's not necessarily exclusive to Haskell though. Thanks. :)

 my example
 do hPutStr handle =<< getLine 
 vs
 do msg <- getLine hPutStr handle msg 
 If there is no speed difference which do yall think is more readable?
 Obviously, the second one is more readable for a novice but I do like the look of just binding `getLine` to `hPutStr handle`.
 EDIT: There is more code after this, it is not just this line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 my team is currently at a crossroad. We've been building a couple of services over the years using the Play framework. Maybe it wasn't the best choice back then, since we really only have an http (mostly) REST backend server, but coming from a Java background, that seemed like a good one-stop-shop.
 Now, given the current maintenance state of the framework, plus the fact that a few other teams have moved to spring-based solutions, we are evaluating where to move next.
 The first choice would be to use Akka-HTTP directly (despite the price), but then that would still require us to rethink:
  
DI framework (guice for play) and service lifecycle - do we need that?
 Actions and action composition - filtering and refining requests
 String translation
 Routes generation - we really liked how easy was to find routes information in play with routes files
  
I played a bit with http4s and tapir, and loved how clean the functional interfaces are, but my colleagues and managers are arguing that "it is not widely used and we just wanna use frameworks/libraries that have good/active support".
 I did some research, and despite seeing that most of the libraries mentioned across the website have frequent-enough updates, I'm not sure which ones are more "reliable" on long term.
 Also, if anyone has any insight, or faced similar problems before, how did you get a resolution?
 Thank you all!

 This error is repeated several times in the *Messages* buffer.

 I have installed all grammar (without any errors) in ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter using treesit-install-language-grammar. I have also checked that c++-ts-mode is the major mode in the buffer. Do I need to set anything else to get this to work?

Now, whenever I change my config it shows up in real time on the website.
 I'm still working on adding to it, but please check out the exported source. I'd love to share more about how I did this for anyone interested.
 In the future, I'll start sharing small articles with more about how to solve common technical problems for python programmers in emacs.

 How do I actually use the new org version? Any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My name is Paribanú Freitas. I am a psychologist and university professor in my country, Uruguay. I am currently doing my doctoral thesis in "social studies" and I came to the zettelkasten method by different youtube content creators.
Through my work I have always been interested in the worlds of productivity and the articulation between educational processes and difficult resources of intellectual work. In fact, a few years ago I have been blogging on this last subject, although I do not publish very much on it: www.tdg.hypotheses.org .
Clearly for those of us who are knowledge workers at different levels (and especially if that knowledge is academic knowledge) I believe the zettelkasten method is really essential and definitive. Luhmann's productivity clearly demonstrates it and I do not understand how the teaching of the method in depth and in a practical way is not part of the educational grids at the university level.
Currently, along with researching and implementing the method in order to support my doctoral research, I am thinking of opening an extracurricular and open course at my university on digital tools for intellectual work, study and writing techniques, time organization resources and other skills and technologies to be "taught" by Twitch. There are already many students who have shown interest in the proposal and I love that it's on Twitch since I think I'm a bit of a geek despite my age.
Finally, this semester I have also created a discord community (in Spanish) for postgraduate students from Latin America. If anyone is interested, I leave the link in case it works: https://discord.gg/c7CX6TVExH
I'm glad I found this community and I'll be participating in it frequently for sure. Thank you so much!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always thought of integrating both together, yet with no success. org-roam usually has many files, which tends to make org-agenda much slower. I've been using task management paradigms to fulfill the missing context of the tasks in the agenda. Until I found this article recently Task management with org-roam Vol. 5: Dynamic and fast agenda which was really helpful. Ironically, I had seen it even before but i didn't give it much attention because I assumed it will be deadly slow. After applying it, my agenda has become a little bit slower, but it was just fine. After this, I learned that using org-ql for the agenda (instead of org search) makes it faster up to 5 times, and there is cache support. Now the agenda loading speed is no longer a problem, and each task has full context and relation tags to its categories.

 However, on typing C-c C-z, it shows error Could not find any installation of GHC. 
 ![Screenshot of above error]1
 And when I use same command again, it launches a new window with what looks like ghci. But when I try to type and execute something, it shows an error "haskell-process" has died as below. (If it matters at all, there is a tests.cabal in the directory where the current open file resides)
 ![Screenshot of haskell process died error]2
 If I enter y then it throws the same error as above about GHC not being found. 
 Now I have my GHC, Stack, Cabal, and HLS installations managed through GHCup. Therefore by default, I only have the ghcup path in the system PATH variable. 
 Since many places online said that there needs to be the ghc path in the PATH, I added the line export PATH=$PATH:/home/axiom/.ghcup/bin/ghc to my .bashrc. But this didn't fix anything. 
 Further, I looked for other solutions and tried two more things: 
 I added the following lines in my .emacs.d/init.el :  (setenv "PATH" (concat "/home/axiom/.ghcup/bin/ghc" (getenv "PATH"))) (setq exec-path (append '("/home/axiom/.ghcup/bin/ghc") exec-path))  Adding this also didn't solve anything. 
 Then I replaced the above lines with (setq haskell-process-path-ghci "/home/axiom/.ghcup/bin/ghc") and this didn't help either. 
 I think the error Could not find any installation of GHC. is being returned from a piece of code in this file https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode/blob/master/haskell-customize.el but I am not able to figure out how to fix my system according to what the haskell-mode code is trying to do before throwing the above error.

 The reason I thing this is a emacs thing and not a whitespace.el or even theme related thing is because it also happened to comments when I used a different theme (I used gruvbox-dark before and now I use catppuccin-mocha).
 Anyway, if someone could tell me what causes it and more importantly how could I disable it, I would be very thankful.

 Sorry if it's a beginner or very obvious thing, but I swear I tried searching with a lot of different terms and couldn't find anything related to it (I say this expecting the actual answer to be something very obvious)
 ​
 Update: I was looking for something to help me in the emacs docs, and in the face attribute page i foun this:
 :distant-foreground Alternative foreground color, a string. This is like :foreground but the color is only used as a foreground when the background color is near to the foreground that would have been used. This is useful for example when marking text (i.e., the region face). If the text has a foreground that is visible with the region face, that foreground is used. If the foreground is near the region face background, :distant-foreground is used instead so the text is readable. 
 Solution: add this to your init file
 (set-face-attribute 'region nil :distant-foreground nil)

 The tutorial that helped me with the initial configuration of Emacs is Elpaca, so that is what I am using. This is my AUCTeX configuration. 
 (use-package auctex :ensure t :defer t :config (setq TeX-auto-save t) (setq TeX-parse-self t)) (setq-default TeX-master nil) 
 This seems to enable the package successfully, and I can compile files and preview them as PDFs, although it sometimes gets stuck on compilation and I have to try again.
 Also, strangely keybinding on my machine seems to be different than the ones in the documentation and guides, for example, "C-c C-e" does not trigger latex-insert-block, but latex-close-block.
 All of this seems very strange, and I have not found anyone having such problems online.

 As part of moving all my calendar needs to Emacs, I wrote a short package that displays the calendar of the org date/time picker in the minibuffer (with support for mouse selecting and other common calendar keybindings).
 Calendar in mini-buffer
 It's done by advising org-read-date and so should work for all org related date picking.
 To use, copy the file in the gist somewhere accessible from Emacs, followed by
 (require 'org-minical) (setq org-read-date-popup-calendar 'minibuffer) (setq org-minical-exit-on-click t) 
 Comments are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a stupid question. I create a trait that attempts to encapsulate a third party library. Initially there will only have one specific library instance implementation (Let's called it library A). Later on there will add some others. To my best of knowledge, I can make use of type class for such purpose. The code is below.
 # Scala version 2.12.x # JDK 11 trait MyTrait[T] { ... some methods ... } object MyTrait { def apply[T: MyTrait]() = implicitly[Logging[T]] implicit val lib1 = new MyTrait[Lib1]{ ... } } 
 Now there is another question coming in. When using this library A, it depends on some external information. However, when creating type class, it can't pass additional information because it's created by initializing trait. Though I can directly pass those additional information during implicit trait initialization like `new MyTrait[A] { val a = ...; val b = ...; }`, it's hard coded, and becomes global variables, which looks not right to me. 
 Any suggestions to achieve such goal in a better way? Many thanks.

All good. But... I have a more complex project setup (flutter create my_project) and my main.dart exists in the lib subdirectory. I created a .projectile in the project root, I also did a "git init" to be sure of "project root" purity.
 But here's the issue: every time I open the main.dart , LSP asks me again to import it: it doesn't remember it has done AND flycheck shows no errors. I'm out of ideas of what it can be. I've a feeling it's going to be something painfully obvious.
 I removed the lsp session.el to check that wasnt corrupted too.
 (eglot deals with the same file in the same lib subdirectory with no issues.)
 Suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to match inline src blocks of the form src_python[]{} exactly once via regex search. I have the regex "\\(src_python\\[.*]{\\)\\([^}]*\\)\\(}\\)" which can match the src block, but if there are two src blocks of that form on the same line, the regex captures both of them as a singular inline src block. Is there a way like in python to specify that the pattern should only be matched one at a time? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An idea I've had for a package for a while is one that would use spaced repetition to teach keyboard shortcuts.
 My thinking is that it would draw the shortcuts to teach from a few lists, including: - Shortcuts manually set by the user. - Shortcuts for functions often called by the user with M-x. - A manual list of shortcuts the user could define (this could include shortcuts for programs outside of Emacs).
 A simple idea, but I feel what could make it handy is that, if the user uses a keyboard shortcut in the normal course of using Emacs, that would count as a 'review' of the shortcut. So that would delay the next time that shortcut will come up.
 If a shortcut became a part of their regular use, the review time would get so long, they never see it again (so they're not wasting time learning shortcuts they have already internalised).
 I've been using a very rudimentary and undocumented version of this for some time, and I've found it an enormously helpful tool to help myself learn keyboard shortcuts.
 Interested to hear if others would find this valuable, or if this is something only I'd find worthwhile. Also interested to hear any suggestions people may have.

 I published a little mode to open a Scala REPL based on scala-cli (the next scala command).
 The repo is here: https://github.com/ag91/scala-cli-repl 
 And a blog that describes the features is here: https://ag91.github.io/blog/2023/07/22/scala-cli-repl-a-scala-repl-based-on-scala-cli/
 Hope this helps some Scala developer out there ;)

 I was going to try out emacs but I want the aesthetic of Doom but without evil-mode. I would like to test out Meow and use Doom but disable evil. I don't know how to go about doing this, I've jumped back and forth between vanilla and evil for the last two months. 
 Can someone help me in regards to how I can achieve this by what I need to add or change in the ~/.doom.d config. 
 I am confused fyi I do not program (yet) I will be next semester but for now I would just be using it for note taking and trying to tinker around with formatting academic papers. I believe there may be a package for helping with formatting MLA, APA with citations ect.

 I'm currently 100% in neovim for my day-to-day work. I know want to also start a personal emacs config for a more "gui" like editor that can also do a bit more outside of text editing. In all my emacs attempts so far, i included evil mode, as it's close to what i know from neovim. But i can't help but wonder if i'm skipping a portion of what emacs is.
 So, with that said: If you started from scratch, migrating from vim, would you go with evil mode or stick to "stock" emacs keybindings? Maybe of interest: I use a ergo keyboard with thumb keys. So, Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Meh and Hyper are pretty easy to access.

 It is also a seed stage startup with a lot of user growth in 2022-2023, and a lot of exciting technical and product problems to solve to grow faster.
 We are looking for a systems Haskell engineer who:
  
wants to work in a startup (high pace and intensity, longer hours, a substantial part of the compensation is stock options, solving only customer problems and avoiding over-engineering).
 expert in Haskell, including: 
 strictness.
 network libraries.
 exception handling, concurrency, STM.
 type systems - we use ad hoc dependent types a lot.
 
 exceptionally pragmatic.
 has some expertise in network protocols, cryptography and general information security principles and approaches.
 
interested to build the next generation of messaging network.
 
does not suffer from "not invented here" syndrome, and at the same time interested to design and implement protocols and systems from the ground up when appropriate.
 
 We prefer links to projects and blog posts and short descriptions to CVs – please don't send more than 1/2 of the page.
 You can apply via LinkedIn, or, better, just reach out.

 running, ongoing record with number of sets, - weights

        <updated>2023-07-20T20:37:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I wanted to make a fair bit of progress before announcing it, but a few weeks ago, I started working on lightweight bindings to the Botan cryptography library's C FFI. Initially, I was trying to revive the defunct Z-Botan bindings, but stripping it of its non-building dependencies proved to be infeasible, and the embedded version of Botan also proved to be out of date. Rather than give up, I decided to make a project of it, and start from scratch with fresh bindings to the latest version in modern Haskell.
 This approach has been extremely rewarding, and today, I am proud to share that I have hit a wonderful milestone - I am halfway through implementing the low-level 1:1 bindings.
 Right now, the bindings support:
  
Hashing
 Message authentication codes
 Symmetric ciphers
 Block cipher modes
 Public key signatures
 Bcrypt and Password hashing
 Random number generators
 Base16 and Base64 encoding
  
Frankly, it is awkward to use, isn't versioned yet, and does not even have any algorithm constants (yet!), but as long as you can read the Botan C FFI docs, it works - and if everything keeps going as smoothly as it has, a friendlier high-level interface isn't too far away.
 I don't have a project page yet, but if you want to follow this project, you can check out the repo, or you can follow the devlog on the Haskell Discourse where I've been more-or-less posting daily.

 However, I noticed that the "emacs tutorial" buffer does not open with the line numbers enabled.
 But if I open the "Emacs guided tour" buffer, the line numbers show up for it. Also for other files (example Haskell file I was editing, the line numbers are automatically enabled when I open it)
 So seems like only for the "emacs tutorial" buffer its not showing the line numbers. I'm curious as to why that is since the config clearly says it should be enabled globally.

 A client library and UI for Lemmy, has most of the basics in working order now. interested to hear your feedback if you give it a go. other complex UI features like rich post composing and image handling will be ported from mastodon.el.
 it is designed to have a clean API layer, so the functions in lem-api.el could be used to create other interfaces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine you have full customization on the bindings to native interactive functions, you can utilize and perfect the existing frameworks, which can be chord, modal or hybrid, what would you do most likely to operate the default bindings? 
 Rough idea: Can we design a more coherent keybinding based on the god-mode with sub-modes invoked by the default mode, consisting the following components
  
X mode (which obeys part of existing C-x things, but not all anyway)
 Convert mode (which converts keys in the default mode for a new layer of functionalities)
 Visit mode (which controls buffer navigation, page scrolling without changing the content)
 Insert mode (which allows characteristics input, including minibuffer) 
  
where default mode itself has a layer of functionalities such as p for previous-line, n for next-line.
 Any of those sub-mode is invoked by a char in the default mode, once invoked, you stay at one of those mode unless terminated by an escape key (i.e. g), where it needs consecutive press of gg for exiting insert mode.
 More intuitions: suppose we set the visit mode to the v, it navigates to the previous buffer by vp, once in the loop, you can navigates again by p, or n for next buffer until it receives the termination key g.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I wanted to let the community know that I recently made a fork of mu4e-send-delay that is compatible with recent versions of Emacs and mu4e. If you aren't aware, this is a package that provides functionality to mu4e similar to Gmail's "schedule send," which sends emails after a designated amount of time, rather than immediately. In addition refactoring the codebase, this package is also compatible with Org-msg. There are other differences, and they are enumerated in the newly-renovated README.
 The original repository may not be maintained anymore, and has been inactive for the last several years at the very least. I use the package myself but had to clean up and update the code so it works with current Emacs. I thought I'd share my updated version.
 Anyway, here's my fork: https://github.com/krisbalintona/mu4e-send-delay
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One classic appeal of Haskell is that its type system allows experts to define very precise constraints within the program’s problem domain.
In my working experience, such powerful constraints are a double-edged sword for projects with long lifespans.
These sophisticated types do, as promised, statically prevent many kinds of costly mistakes and are indeed expressed via definitions that resemble the particular problem domain better than many other general purpose languages would allow.
On the other hand, the requisite definitions tend to be dense and leak noisy details of how exactly the domain-specific constraints were encoded in the GHC Haskell type system.
This is sadly often apparent in the poor quality of error messages that arise when these type-level programs catch a user’s mistake.…]]></summary>

 The question is simple: how to make a new extension? OR: how do people make a new extension?
 The question is also more complicated:
  
How do people manage to have so many slightly incompatible versions of the same language without generating dependency conflicts? 
 There certainly exists mutually exclusive extensions. What are some examples?
 Do we have a trivial demo extension, say, inserting a new keyword into the language which does nothing?

 It relies on the completing-read built-in interface, and thus benefits greatly from integration with consult, marginalia, vertico and embark.

 QQ: does anyone here actually use value classes/opaque types for their core?
 I think I haven't run into any prod code base that actually uses this.
 I thought about trying it out for a personal project, but they seem weird to use. To me it looks like one of those things that look great in theory but in practice are kind of iffy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just got Haskell installed using GHCup in WSL2 (Ubuntu). However, there is a problem with the ghci interpreter.
 When I start ghci and I press enter, the interpreter doesn't create a new line, but rather prints in the console the prefix ghci and get ready to receive the next command.
 A new line is only after I enter a new command and get the output in the same line.
 Below is an example of what I see in the terminal.
 ```bash
 $ ghci
 GHCi, version 9.2.8: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/ :? for help
 ghci> ghci> ghci> ghci> ghci> 4+48
 ghci>

 And below is what I would expect:
 ```bash
 $ ghci

 ghci>
 ghci>
 ghci>
 ghci>
 ghci> 4 + 4
 8

 ```
 The question is: how can I solve it?

 NOTE: This question is not just about double-space vs. single-space. This is about which spacing to use within double-quotes. That's the important bit.
 This is a question for all the double-spacers out here. You use the default (setq sentence-end-double-space t). How do you do the sentence spacing for quoted text? Do you write it like this?
 Bob said, "I get three apples. You get two apples. Ok?" Jess responded, "No, I get three apples. You get two apples." Bob was not amused. Jess took out his bag, getting ready to collect apples. 
 Or do you write it like this?

I want to experiment with Emacs, and I stumbled across a few tutorials that show how to customise your own emacs.d - I thought if I could have (for instance) one stock config, one Doom Emacs config, and a couple of tutorial configs I could avoid getting stuck so hard that I have an unusable Emacs. I would like to avoid installing different copies of Emacs on the same machine, but if that is the way to go, I suppose it would not be the worst thing.
 Is it possible to have multiple Emacs configs? Is there a way to choose at startup which config or "profile" you want to use for that session? Or does Emacs even work that way?

 I'm on doom emacs, which doesn't document anything, so help would be really appreciated.
 UPDATE: Thank you all for help. I stayed with edebug and will try to use backtrace-toggle-locals with backtrace to debug emacs code. However, the backtrace keeps disappearing after you run "next-mode" in edebug - does anyone know if you can "make it stick"? It's impossible to debug code when it disappears each time you step to next line.
 Those are such basic things, emacs makes life really hard for new users.

 I've checked that org-file-apps uses default program to open html (librewolf) and hyperlinks work with it correctly.
 Does anyone know what function is responsible for finding/opening files in ox-pandoc package? There was a similar issue in 2016, but the function author mentioned seems no longer available in doom emacs.
 UPDATE: I've traced the code down to this function in ox-pandoc.el:
  (process-put process 'buffer-or-open buffer-or-open) 
 This should start pandoc with the name of the output file (.html). I will try to run edebug on it and see if values can be inspected.
 UPDATE2: I seem to be hitting a wall with edebug. Does anyone know how to use normal debugger in doom emacs? It doesn't seem to have any run function or any debug- function? You'd think that things like that would be documented.
 org-file-apps:
 ((remote . emacs) (auto-mode . emacs) (directory . emacs) ("\\.mm\\'" . default) ("\\.x?html?\\'" . default) ("\\.pdf\\'" . default))

 - In the 2018 stackoverflow survey, vim came out as 6 times more popular than emacs.
 If vim is more popular, do you think this reflects a preference for vim—or are people just not aware of the existence of emacs?

 It should be enough to change [ ] on third line to TODO. However all examples I could find only use add-to-list function to create new capture templates instead updating the existing one. I'd rather not edit the existing files to avoid conflicts when updating (doom) emacs.
 Would you just create a new entry with a different letter? Or can you just a new entry with the same letter and org will use the newer one?

 Hello,
 I am currently reading a paper about an algorithm that hashes programs while respecting alpha equivalence (Interesting read! source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02856.pdf)
 The language they used for demonstration purposes is very very barebones (basically just the simply untyped lambda calculus, found on page 5)
 I thought I finally understand the entire paper but one quote was still left in my mind, namely on page 5:

Because of corporate complications, that I cannot talk about, the process of new app installing is long and ultimately uncertain. So, I am trying to set up Emacs to work with Python. I get a tutorial and everything. But the very first step is failing for me. I added this lines to the ~/.emacs

 I saved the file and restart Emacs and get this error:

I tried to google for it, but did not find anything. I suspect that connections like that might be blocked by some firewall rules or something similar - again, tight security. But it would be nice to find out if that is the case, because it is still possible that I just did something wrong or that I can fix it somehow without talking to server admins.

 First a bit of context. Learning Haskell forced me through multiple "epiphanies" about building software (if you are on this subreddit you know) and the jump from OO languages with imprecise or non-existent type systems to working with pure functions and a mathematically coherent type system changed the way I build systems. Unfortunately, it took years of pain before I jumped into functional programming, simply because I didn't know there was another way of doing things.

 The error I got whenever I try to preview my latex is:
 org-compile-file: File "/tmp/orgtexNnJFiR.dvi" wasn’t producedPlease adjust ‘dvipng’ part of ‘org-preview-latex-process-alist’. 
 I tried this, didn't work.
 I checked basic exporting from org to pdf. I got the error:
 ! LaTeX Error: File `ulem.sty' not found. 
 Which is weird, since when I search for the file using pacman -F ulem.sty, I get:
 extra/texlive-core 2021.58710-2 (texlive-most) usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/generic/ulem/ulem.sty 
 Did some experience that before?

 I'm back with a follow-up on GPT-Commit, the AI-powered tool that generates commit messages. First off, I want to extend my gratitude to everyone who provided feedback on my previous post. Your insights have been invaluable in refining GPT-Commit.
 In this new blog post, I've shared real-world examples of how GPT-Commit works with different types of commits, specifically using actual commits from the Angular project. I believe these examples will give you a clearer picture of how GPT-Commit can be utilized in your workflow.
 The post also discusses the benefits of using GPT-Commit and how it can help developers save time and increase efficiency. 
 You can read the blog post here: https://ywkim.github.io/gpt-commit-real-world-examples-benefits/
 The examples are all based on actual commits from the Angular project, which you can check out here: https://github.com/angular/angular
 For more information about GPT-Commit, please visit the repository: https://github.com/ywkim/gpt-commit
 I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback on these improvements. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to share!

 For example, "#" followed by a white space in a customized tex macro would lead JSON.parse to split the argument into two separate lines; and the `math-preview-mathjax-tex-digits' variable, which is by default defined as "/?:[0-9]+(?:\{,\}[0-9]*)?|\{,\}[0-9]+)/" will cause the inexplicable "Invalid filename…]]></summary>

 I guess this can be overcome by editing the resolver field in my project's stack.yaml. Until now I have had stack.yaml in my .gitignore since stack init generates the file, but maybe it's recommended to add stack.yaml to git repositories?
 Also strange that ghc-9.4.5 (used in lts-21.3) ships with filepath-1.4.2.2. That filepath version was released in 2021 but at the time ghc-9.4.5 was released (2023) System.OsPath was available in the newer filepath packages.
 Another question: Should I be progressive and start using OsPath in my new programs?

 Intuitively, I was convinced that Scala and DL were a perfect match but it seems not to be the case. Is there any particular technical element that would explain why ? Is this purely performance related ?

 For users, the upshot is: there were certain methods in the Java reflection API that weren’t callable from Scala 3 — but now they are, as of Scala 3.3.0.
 But the blog post goes into detail about those methods and about how we implemented support for them. It may be of interest to JVM aficionados, Scala and Java language mavens, and compiler hackers.

 I've got a piece of code that looks like this:
 bestSolutionScore solutions = maximum scores where solutionsList = M.toList solutions scores = [ evalSolution s1 s1 | s1 <- solutionList , s2 <- solutionList ] evalSolution (k1, v1) (k2, v2) | somePredicate k1 k2 = v1 + v2 | otherwise = 0 
 I should be able to create all of the elements of scores in parallel, and the maximum is a reduce that should be able to be done in parallel too, and consume elements of scores as soon as they're generated.
 But my feeble attempts at using a map ... parList evaluation strategy didn't produce anything other that a lot of stack use.
 Any suggestions on how to spread this task across cores?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuing this emacs thread
 This was first reported with Fedora 37, and I don't know if it's KDE specific or not, but basically graphical emacs is unusable because the frame shrinks every time you interact with the minibuffer. Type M-x, watch your frame shrink. 
 People have suggested things like 
  (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t) ; nope (setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t) ; nope 
 This does not work. I haven't found a solution yet other than running emacs in terminal mode. However I do have a new piece of data to add.
 When, in an Fedora 38 environment where emacs is broken, I ssh -X to a Fedora 36 environment where emacs is not broken, and run emacs remotely but display it locally on F38, the broken behavior manifests.
 This means it's nothing about emacs 28.2 that is the problem, it's just some interaction with emacs and whatever passes for the X server and window environment. I have yet to find any KDE behavior stuff I can tweak to fix it, and emacs tweaks have been similarly ineffective. SO ... looking for more help if anybody has it. I plead ignorance on X vs Wayland and what would traditionally be emacs in X client interactions.

 Here is how I set it up:

 I can start Eglot in a file of my project but nothing works even though the server is connected and running. I don't think the problem comes from the lsp server as it is working when using lsp-mode.
 Is there something I forgot to do / not aware of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using flycheck in Org mode and would like to skip certain lines, like property drawer, from being checked by the tool. Is there any way to do this? 
 I suppose adding inline comment (like "# noqa") wouldn't work given it may not be recognized as comments. Otherwise, I would imagine that I need to use some hook to inspect each line and decide to filter in or out before the line being checked.
 I wonder if any standard solution already exists.

 A brief post to announce that Indigo 0.15.0-RC3 has been released, with an all new* axis-aligned physics engine.
 (* Read: Limited, inaccurate, no doubt buggy, but nonetheless rather satisfying...)
 (Please note that the lag in the image below is the gif recording, and doesn't not reflect the true frame rate, which is displayed in the top left.)
 Animation of axis-aligned physics in the Indigo game engine
 There are lots of details in the release notes linked below:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.15.0-RC3
 If you'd like to see a simple game / demo built with it, here's one I made earlier:
  
Code - https://github.com/davesmith00000/pong
 Play - https://davesmith00000.github.io/pong/
  
I hope you try building something with it. Please feel free to report any issues, or come and get help / hang out on our Discord server.
 If any of you have even the slightest passing interest in physics and / or maths ...then you're already more qualified than I am to have built such a thing! Do consider joining in and helping me improve it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps somebody knows how to fix this.
 I have been having a weird problem, when once in a while, org-ctags gets loaded, and org-ctags-enable gets executed. Once org-ctags-enable gets executed, org-internal tags stop working (org-ctags wants a etags file for _any_ internal link). See https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/13p9zog/internal_links_asking_for_tags_table/
 ​
 I don't want that.
 I traced it and here is what I have:
  
help--load-prefixes contains org-ctags (among many others)
 I ask for describe-variable org-reverse-note-order
 org-ctags gets loaded, and org-ctags-enable gets executed
 looking at the source code of org-ctags, it executes (org-ctags-enable) when it gets loaded.
  
How can I remove org-ctags from the help--load-prefixes.
 But perhaps more importantly:
 should autoexecuting org-ctags-enable be considered a bug?

 Is there a GUI version of emacs I could download but have the same experience with? and get good customize-ability to?
 I use VSCodium(VSCODE) but I want something more lightweight. Is there any way to make running CPP and Python code as good as VSC via emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know a little about curry-howard isomorphism, which shows the relationship between formal system and type system. However I want to go further in this direction. Are there more such correspondences other than the usual STLC and dependent type systems? (I've also seen articles on linear types and linear logic) For example what type systems does modal logic correspond to? Are there any survey on this topic? Many thanks!

 I'm using https://docs.doomemacs.org/v21.12/modules/ui/workspaces/ to manage workspaces in emacs
 Say that there is one session, 2 workspaces, each workspace manages one project
 One thing I have noticed is: - On macos, each workspace has its own lsp pid - On linux, the lsp pids are the same on those 2 workspaces
 Do you guys know to fix this issue? Thanks in advance,
 Update: sorry for missing what I expect 🙏
 I expect the behavior on linux should be the same with macos
 The context here is: - Each workspace is a project - The project uses pyls as lsp

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to emacs, but intend to learn to use it for orgmode and latex. I'm not a technical user yet but I plan on becoming one.
 I had org-cdlatex and latex previews working yesterday and kept tinkering my config, but today cdlatex broke. After commenting the new lines in my config, some functionality is missing.
 1.- Pairing of the "$" delimiters doesn't work. If I type both manually and write "fr<tab>" inside it does expand to $\frac{}{}$.
 2.- Writing the quote " ' " doesn't work in text mode. If I type the quote inside a math environment it works almost as expected. Typing $ab'b results in "$a\mathbf{b}" instead of $\mathbf{ab}$. Typing ab'b inside of a manually closed pair $$ still doesn't work. Typing the quote in any normal text doesn't work at all. 
 Doing C-h k ' says that ' is supposed to run org-cdlatex-math-modify. Trying to run manually with M-x after a text that should expand returns "Wrong type argument: commandp, nil", and the Org>LaTeX>Modify math symbol of the menu bar appears greyed out.
 ​
 How should I start to troubleshoot this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently migrated from straight.el to elpaca, and unfortunately this broke my hyperbole installation. I originally had hyperbole installed using the guide provided by the manual here---I've largely tried to reproduce this in elpaca but I keep getting the following error when my config tries to load the package (specifically on loading hypb-ert.el):
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (void-variable hyperbole-run-test) 
 I feel that I'm most of the way there, but I'm just missing something basic. What I've done so far:
  
have elpaca clone hyperbole from the source repo ("https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/hyperbole.git")
 manually symlink the /kotl, /man, and /test folders from the /elpaca/repos/hyperbole directory to the /elpaca/builds/hyperbole directory (elpaca doesn't do this for some reason)
  
Has anyone here gotten this working? I've dug around in the source code and hyperbole-run-test doesn't seem to be mentioned much outside of a defal clause in hypb-ert.el itself. I'd greatly appreciate if anyone here has any insight!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using a package called super-save in Emacs, which automatically saves the buffer whenever the Emacs window loses focus. While it initially seemed like a convenient feature, over time, I've come to realize that it's not always the best idea. There have been instances where I made mistakes in a file, such as accidentally removing a large number of lines, and when I clicked on a different window, the result got automatically saved without me noticing. This has led to some unexpected and unwanted changes in my files.
 I'm curious to know if anyone else has had similar experiences. Have you used super-save or any similar functionality, and did it prove to be useful in your case? I'm trying to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before deciding whether to continue using it. I believe that pressing the good old C-x C-s key combination is the best option. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs comes with two built-in IRC clients, rcirc and erc. The latter has a history entry in its manual ((info "(erc) History")) and thus sheds a little bit of light on its age:
  
7 History
  
ERC was originally written by Alexander L. Belikoff and Sergey Berezin. They stopped development around December 1999. Their last released version was ERC 2.0.
 ...
 2006
 ERC 5.1 was released. It was subsequently included in Emacs 22.
  
rcirc on the other hand is missing such an entry, but the copyright starts at 2006, roughly around the inclusion of ERC within Emacs. If you searche the Emacs manual for IRC, you end up with two mentions, one within Acknowledgments for ERC, one for "Bug Reference":
  
3. Setup for IRC channels configurable by the variable ‘bug-reference-setup-from-irc-alist’. The built-in IRC clients Rcirc, and ERC, are supported.
  
Nowhere within Emacs do I find a comparison why there are two, and whether there are different use cases for both.
 With that in mind: what are the (architectural?) differences between ERC and rcirc? If ERC already existed, why was rcirc also included in Emacs?
 Thanks in advance!

I always have difficulty when visiting a long-time not visited org file, where it may have lots of headings and their sub-headings, and so on. I need to have an overall grasp of which headings have sub-headings when collapsed and only first-level headings are shown. Since, headings and sub-headings are a lot, so I'm used to only showing first-level headings and opening up a certain heading when I know exactly that it has sub-headings. If I use C-Tab, all second-level sub-headings of first-headings will be shown up, which adds more obstacle for navigating!
 In ideal, sub-headings of their parent heading should also have this symbol in the end of them, if they have their own sub-headings.
 It's gonna be a dream to come into reality, so I can finally, completely move from zim to emacs. Among Gui note-taking programs, zim is the most powerful yet simple that has every feature that I need.
 But the only downside of it is that it relays so much on mouse, instead of providing actions that can completely be done on only keyboard. When working on a laptop, which provides less-comfort for controlling the cursor, this issue has become more serious for me.
 Please, the elisp wizards! help this elisp idiot to get it through, I'm so bad at programming, learning elisp has been so tough to do it, I cannot really figure it out myself, damn :(

 I tried to zoom using Xrandr as follows:
 xrandr --output eDP-1 --primary --mode 2560x1440 --panning 2560x1800 --scale 0.8x0.8 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal --output DP-1 --off --output HDMI-1 --off --output DP-2 --off
 This enlarges the text appropriately, but now much of the screen is now not shown (I can't see the modeline, minibuffer, etc.
 I'm sure there's some obvious solution to this, but the documentation I've read doesn't make it clear what I should do.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was going over some advent of code days in this (excelent) scala3 repository and i found this code bit:
  def parse(input: Seq[String]): Map[String, Monkey] = input.map { case s"$name: $left $operation $right" => name -> Operation(left, operation, right) case s"$name: $value" => name -> Number(value.toLong) } .toMap 
 which is new to me (the case inside a map over a list of strings). How is it called and is there more documentation available?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe someone here can help. I have the following problem. I am trying to use a nix-shell as suggested here on a remote host using tramp. 
 I am using doomemacs with nix-doom-emacs.
 Working on local
 foo.org
 ```
 +begin_src nix /tmp/shell.nix
 {pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }: pkgs.mkShell { buildInputs = with pkgs; [ hello ]; }
 +end_src
 +begin_src shell :shebang "#!/usr/bin/env nix-shell\n#!nix-shell /tmp/shell.nix -i bash --pure" :results output
 hello
 +end_src
 +RESULTS:
 : Hello, world! ```
 Broken on Remote
 foo.org
 ``` org
 +begin_src nix :tangle /ssh:user@host:/tmp/shell.nix
 {pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }: pkgs.mkShell { buildInputs = with pkgs; [ hello ]; }
 +end_src
 +begin_src shell :dir /ssh:user@host:~/ :shebang "#!/usr/bin/env nix-shell\n#!nix-shell /tmp/shell.nix -i bash --pure" :results output
 hello
 +end_src
 +RESULTS:
 : : command not found ```
 *Org-Babel Error Output*
 It is trying to run zsh /ssh:user@host:/tmp/sh-script-wcS20a instead of just the ./tmp/sh-script-wcS20a.
 text zsh:1: no such file or directory: /ssh:user@host:/tmp/sh-script-wcS20a 
 /tmp/sh-script-wcS20a
 ```
 !/usr/bin/env nix-shell
 !nix-shell /tmp/shell.nix -i bash --pure
 hello ```
 Edit: Shebang scripts are tun like ./foo and not like zsh ./foo. Wen executing this using Tramp /ssh:user@host: it tries to run the script the wrong was.

 /u/emilypii
 /u/IdaBzo

They have all been sent invitations to be moderators, and the Haskell Foundation has now formally transitioned all moderator authority to the new team. While some of the selected moderators are involved with the HF, their service as moderators is as individuals.
 Once again, we'd like thank /u/taylorfausak for his long service here and elsewhere, and we'd like to thank the new moderation team for taking on the task.

But I would do less than justice to Mr. Adler's achievement if I left the matter there. The Syntopicon is, in addition to all this, and in addition to being a monument to the industry, devotion, and intelligence of Mr. Adler and his staff, a step forward in the thought of the West.

 I'm currently in the process of trying out (and hopefully embracing) emacs. Coming from a vim past, I'm playing around with doom emacs and was wondering, is there a way to make the vi-style fringe (indicating end-of-file) bold faced in it?
 My apologies if this isn't the right subreddit to ask (please feel free to let me know the right one). Thanks in advance!

All went well. But now I want to see other changes in the commit. What's the best way to do that? Currently I just copy the commit hash and do a git show in terminal. It's not very convenient.
 Thanks.

How do you set the Treemacs face? Using describe face, there are lots of different ones and I would like to make them all the same, a non-monospace font. They seem to inherit directly from the default font, so I am not changing that.
 
I have been playing with layouts and, no matter what I do (spc-l-l or spc-p-l), all the layouts still seem to include files from the other layouts when i do c-x,c-b or spc-b-b. What am I missing? 
 
One more - how do I force things to always appear on the same window? I want magit to always replace my main code editor and nothing else, and all vterms to always to appear at the bottom, like in VSCode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I edit markdown, i usually set Emacs to word wrap mode (visual line).
 I would prefer the following: If I press END, point moves to the end of the screen line. That already works because of visual-line-mode. If cursor is already at the end of the screen line, point should move to the end of the physical line.
 Pos1 should behave likewise, with an additional twist: If point is at the beginning of a screen line but not at the beginning of the physical line, it moves to the beginning of the physical line. If I additionally press pos1 and the beginning of the physical line is a blank character (character class), it moves to the first non-blank character of the line. Another Pos1 again toggles jumping to the first physical character in the line.
 I am sure this can be configured - as pretty much everything in Emacs. There likely is even a package for that?

That is why we want to build systems that foster cross-team communication,

However, designing a monorepo can be challenging as it impacts the development workflow of all engineers

Special care for tooling is required for a monorepo to stay performant as a team grows.
In our previous article,
we described our choice of structure and tools to bootstrap a Python monorepo.

  (setopt elisp-flymake-byte-compile-load-path load-path) 
 Given the following code:
  (require 'consult) (global-set-key (kbd "C-c M-x") #'consult-mode-command) 
 There's no warning, since i require'd the consult feature. The package will eagerly load as that line is evaluated (or before).
 However, given this other piece of code:
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-.") #'embark-act) (global-set-key (kbd "M-.") #'embark-dwim) (global-set-key (kbd "C-h B") #'embark-bindings) 
 I get the following warnings:
  warning e-f-b-c the function ‘embark-act’ might not be defined at runtime. warning e-f-b-c the function ‘embark-dwim’ might not be defined at runtime. warning e-f-b-c the function ‘embark-bindings’ might not be defined at runtime. 
 That's because I didn't require'd the embark feature. At runtime that's not an issue since the three functions are autoloaded.
 It seems a waste for me to suppress warnings. On the other hand, one could define declare the functions before using them (or use some comfy macros like use-package and bind-keys). My question is the following: isn't there some way for the byte compiler to detect all autoloaded packages, either in the load-path or in a specific feature?

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y--K5Vjlyo&list=PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7&index=7
 In this episode, we discuss how Booleans convey little information about the outcome of a test, and how replacing Booleans by other datatypes that produce a witness of the success or failure of a test can lead to more robust and therefore better code. This idea is known under many other names, such as "Boolean blindness" or "Parse don't validate".
 Most of the examples in this episode should be understandable to newcomers.
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks.
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:
 https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder
 And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:

 I have tried, but either i have found stuff which is too theoritical, or just debating why macros are not evil or obsolete stuff.
 Is there anything which is new and to-the-point? More code and example driven but step by step?
 There was a similar question asked 7 years ago. Because there has passed by so much time, I'd like to see what kind of resources have been developed.

  (use-package transcribe :custom (a-custom-variable "Hello!")) 
 I'll have use-package-expand-minimally set to t. Having it set to nil will just add additional code that it's not relevant for the question.
 Let's see how the macro expands (with pp-macroexpand-expression):
  (progn (let ((custom--inhibit-theme-enable nil)) (unless (memq 'use-package custom-known-themes) (deftheme use-package) (enable-theme 'use-package) 
 Why is the custom variable set this way? This looks more complex than how it should be, but I'm sure there is a clear reason behind it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been a happy denote user for the last year, but with the launch of Bear 2, I decided to look at the app again. What I realized I missed was an over-arching system for organization. In Bear I can see all my tags and sub-tags in a sidebar and I can move one sub-tag to another tag group, rename, etc. I just felt like I had a little more control over my notes. Denote does have keywords, and if there was a way to nest keywords and also show all keywords in a sidebar, denote would be perfect.
 Is there any package that does this? Either on top of denote or some other standalone package that works with org-mode file? I know org-mode has nested tags, but I don't want a predefined tag list, I'd like it to change organically and on the fly and going the org-mode nested tag route doesn't really work for me.

 I only have one keyboard macro in my configuration: I often read papers from arXiv.org inside Emacs using pdf-tools, and for those I want to set the margins from the bounding box on the second page (since the first page has a bulky watermark), so I use a keyboard macro to go to the next page, set the margins from the bounding box and go back to the page I was on.
 I made this post because I just realized that I often give people the advice to give a key binding to a keyboard macro and put that in their configuration, but don't often follow that advice myself. (It usually goes like this: someone complains, that something is too many keystrokes, and I say, "this is Emacs, no-one can force you to use more than one keystroke for anything!", and proceed to explain keyboard macros).

 The image I made for our group presentation
 So for a university project, we had to choose a language that isn't that popular, our group chose Scala. In general, I think it is great (I enjoy more the scala2 syntax) but documentation is kind of lacking, and native libraries are all over the place. Having to deal with sbt was a thing and making intellij lint, compile and run was an experience. My last complaint is that I had to create my own dockerfile which I am really bad at, like it was really hard to find anything for Scala. 
 Despite that I really enjoy working with Scala as a Java developer, probably will never get a job on it because I dislike data science and at least where I live there is like 0 demand. I am thinking of doing comparable projects in C# and Kotlin to see how they compare to Java and Scala. Hopefully, Scala will regain some popularity but for that, they will probably need a big company behind it, improve documentation, and better native libraries. 
 The last thing, this is my opinion and I am dumb as a rock so you have all the right to criticize my incoherent bag of words and correct me if I am wrong

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have defined an org capture template that includes:
  (file "~/templates/hotdog.txt") 
 and the contents of "~/templates/hotdog.txt" is:
 * Hot Dog Prompt: %^{HOT_SAUCE|yes|no} %(format "Hot Sauce? %s" "%\\1") %(format "%s" (if (string-equal "%\\1" "yes") "Sign waiver" "Enjoy")) 
 When I run the capture template, before I enter the value of HOT_SAUCE, the preview looks like this:
 * Hot Dog Prompt: Hot Sauce? %\1 Enjoy 
 This tells me that the value of "%\\1" at this point is %\1. I'm under the impression that string-equal is comparing "yes" and "%\\1" and thus evaluating to "Enjoy".
 Yes case: If I type in yes at the HOT_SAUCE prompt and press ENTER, the preview changes to:
 ***** Hot Dog Prompt: yes Hot Sauce? yes Enjoy 
 No case: If I type in no at the HOT_SAUCE prompt and press ENTER, the preview changes to:
 ***** Hot Dog Prompt: no Hot Sauce? no Enjoy 
 In both cases the first format function is re-evaluated with the value entered at the prompt.
 In neither case is the second format function re-evaluated.
 According to the documentation on %(EXP):
  
Only placeholders pre-existing within the template, or introduced with ‘%[file]’, are expanded this way. Since this happens after expanding non-interactive “%-escapes”, those can be used to fill the expression.
  
I'm not really sure how to interpret this.
 Question: How can I get the second format function to re-evaluate after I've supplied the HOT_SAUCE value so that it says "Sign Waiver" if I enter yes at the prompt?
 Goal: My goal for my capture template to return significantly different text based on the value of prompt values.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently upstreamed some fixes to a project called helm-ls which is a language server for Helm to make it work with eglot. As part of my contribution, they asked for instructions for use with emacs, which I provided in the README.
 The only problem I have with the instructions I gave is that it feels counterintuitive a little bit? The root of the problem is that, while you could edit Helm charts with yaml-mode, adding eglot-ensure to the yaml-mode hook would mean adding (yaml-mode "helm_ls" "server") to eglot-server-programs, and you probably don't want helm-ls for yaml files that aren't helm charts. Hence my instructions to create a small derived major mode to sidestep the issue.
 That works okay, but means that it becomes hard to automatically enter the newly derived helm-mode. I've read through how emacs chooses major modes, but I couldn't think of a good way to automatically select helm-mode. Ideally, I'd love to have some way of telling auto-mode-alist to traverse up the current buffer's directory until it found files like Chart.yaml and values.yaml that told it the file was actually a Helm chart rather than plain yaml, but it looks like I may be limited to just regex matching the file name, using .dir-locals.el or -*- mode: helm -*- magic.
 Any other ideas/options to make this better?

 Therefore, when I got the idea that we should try to experiment with combining GPT with Wasp in order to generate full-stack JS web apps, I got pretty excited about implementing it in Haskell! We had a short team discussion about whether we should use TypeScript or Haskell but concluded Haskell is a better choice for us due to integrating with the codebase that we already have.

[…] what is the status of dynamic linking on Windows currently? The GHC User’s Guide suggests that it should be fairly simple to accomplish. But the relevant GHC Wiki article says there are problems with the ordinal value getting too large when the DLL has too many symbols. Normally I’d discount a 4-year-old article in favour of the current user’s guide… except that when I tried compiling to a DLL, I did indeed get an error message saying that the ordinals were too large. On Linux, each package is compiled to a separate .so file, which keeps them fairly small, but when I try the same GHC options on Windows, it just complains that there are no 'dyn' versions of the dependencies. Which would seem to indicate that it would work if I could compile the dependencies dynamically, but I can’t find any information on how to do so. This whole situation is quite confusing, and I would greatly appreciate some clarification on GHC’s support for compiling shared libraries on Windows.

 So I'm going to use
 (setq sentence-end-double-space t) 
 now on. This is the default anyway and Emacs works great with it. Thanks for all the comments in that thread. The wisdom of experienced Emacs hackers on that thread enlightened me to the benefits of double-spacing for sentences. Collected a list of threads about sentence spacing:
  
The drawbacks of using single space between sentences - August 2021 (28 comments)
 PSA: sentence-end-double-space - October 2021 (59 comments)
 Sentences - July 2023 (55 comments)
 What do you all think about (setq sentence-end-double-space nil)? - July 2023 (63 comments)
  
Some questions still bothering me. Please help me resolve this.
  
For all the double-spacers out here, what do you do when you have to work on someone else's project which uses single-spacing between sentences? Do you have any shortcuts or tricks to switch to single-spacing mode when you are working on their projects?
 
How do you space sentences within double quotes, like:
 Bob said, "I get three apples. You get two apples. Ok?" Jess responded, "No, I get three apples. You get two apples." Bob was not amused. Jess took out his bag, getting ready to collect apples. 
 Does double spacing seem fine here? Do you think the sentence-end spaces within double-quotes need to be single space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was watching Ben Awad's video about writing FizzBuzz with Haskell and Vim, and that got me thinking about how I would actually do it. I was inspired by a Rust solution that I saw one time.
 In this solution, I'm particularly happy about the function mapM_. If you don't know about it, it just maps a monadic action over a Foldable. There is also a mapM which returns the foldable type containing the result of each computation, but in this case we use the underscore version since we're only concerned with the side-effects of putStrLn.
 Sometimes it's boring to sit for hours and sift through the docs to find functions like mapM_, so I think these kinds of concrete examples are really nice for people who are just getting comfortable with Haskell.
 Upvote if you learned something!
 ```haskell fizzBuzz :: Int -> String fizzBuzz n = case (mod n 3, mod n 5) of (0, 0) -> "FizzBuzz" (0, ) -> "Fizz" (, 0) -> "Buzz" (_, _) -> show n
 main :: IO () main = mapM_ (putStrLn . fizzBuzz) [1..100] ```

 I know Scala has it, and I'm trying to replicate it in Kotlin.
 Scenario
 ```scala sealed trait Key[K]
 object Key{ object Text extends Key[String] object Num extends Key[Int] }
 def getValue[V](key:Key[V]):Option[V] = key match { case Key.Text => /* Here V is known to be String / Some("Hello world") case Key.Num => / Here V is known to be Int */ Some(42) }
 ```
 in the branches of code inside the match expression, V can be narrowed due to the nature of Key.
 How's that feature called?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the odd situation that when I open a .gpg file, I get prompted for the passphrase, but when I try to save this, I don't get a prompt, but Emacs hangs. gpg gets started though:
 ```
 /usr/local/bin/gpg --no-tty --status-fd 1 --yes --enable-progress-filter --command-fd 0 --output /var/folders/x_/10k090mn18n0lpgvs1h_8l3jn84281/T/epg-outputJpLx7A --pinentry-mode loopback --encrypt -r E2B250F222A9E987
 `` But it doesn't cause a prompt in Emacs (or I don't see it). Emacs hangs at this point. If I kill gpgkillall gpg`, Emacs returns control to me. I get this popup:
 ```
 Error while encrypting with "/usr/local/bin/gpg":
 gpg: signal Terminated caught ... exiting
 ```
 This is on a Mac (on a Ubuntu system everything works). This is Emacs 28.2
 Does anyone have any pointers? Just looks like something upon saving interferes perhaps??
 ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf:
 ``` allow-loopback-pinentry
 allow-emacs-pinentry
 default-cache-ttl 86400
 max-cache-ttl 86400
 pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-tty
 ```
 ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf:
 ```
 pinentry-mode loopback
 ```
 init.el:
 ```
 (use-package epg
 :config
 (setq epg-pinentry-mode 'loopback)
 )
 ```
 Obviously the prompt works, that's not the issue. It's an issue when saving.

 I'm just trying to insert a task that won't "break" the existing headline:

 I'm having some hard time trying to implement a select method to my zio-channel lib (which is an implementation for Go-like channels in ZIO). I have the base methods with make, send, receive, status methods and select allowing receive from multiple channels would be awesome but I'm not too keen into ZIO's collectFirst or raceAll or something else that would help me on this.
 Would you contribute to it by looking here: https://github.com/carlosedp/zio-channel/pull/3 ?
 I've even added some test cases to the draft PR. Also suggestions to the rest of the lib API are very welcome!

If anyone is familiar with those graphics libraries, please consider joining the discussion of the bug and even better to help providing the logs. Or providing some guideline for testing in the comment and I'm very willing to run the test. Thanks.

 This is my first sentence. This is my second sentence. I know some languages, e.g., English, Spanish, French. LA has canals. LA is in the most populous US state. 
 So when I write text like above following current style guides I don't get any issue. M-e always goes from one sentence to another like so (sentence jump points marked with %).

 Emacs never get confused with abbreviations in this style. So what is the problem? Why is

 so much discouraged in Emacs even while writing per new style guides? What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm hoping to pick the collective brains of all you fine redditors.
 I write creatively for fun and self therapy, and my exploration of editors under windows showed they tended to be quite slow. I've got my eldest kids' old-ish laptop with a lightweight distro on it that can be chucked in a bag and taken with me wherever I go (I can do backups to my own cloud storage via phone hotspot). 
 I want my writing to be plain text and usable no matter what software I might choose to use on another device. I had thought of using one of the many markdown editors out there, but they don't appear to agree on very much beyond bold/italic/underline.
 I'm here for a speedy way of working without having to use a mouse very often that runs efficiently on that laptop. I don't think I need the lisp knowledge just to use emacs as an editor, and I've really got no interest in learning that language because my head is already stuffed to the gunwhales with python and bash knowledge (both serve my purposes adequately at the moment, so I don't need another language).
 So my question really is: Why emacs, and not a different editor that also has very quick keyboard shortcuts? I'm not saying a vi derivative is better or worse, in fact I'm not saying anything else is better or worse; I'm just after knowledge. I just want to know why emacs and not something else, especially given that I've got no interest in the LISP side of things.
 If emacs is superior to insert-whatever-editor in a particular way, I'd really appreciate thoughts on why that is, and what the other software does worse than emacs.
 Thank you for your time reading, and for any answers you choose to give.

  (defun tvd-emms-follow-playing-song() (interactive) (save-restriction (when emms-playlist-selected-marker (goto-char emms-playlist-selected-marker)))) (add-hook 'emms-playlist-selection-changed-hook 'tvd-emms-follow-playing-song 1) 
 However, this doesn't work, point is not moved when a new song starts to play. When I execute the function manually, it works( I added a couple of print statements to the function, which are being executed every time the song changes). So, it's actually being executed by the hook, but the goto-char part doesn't have any effect.
 Does anyone have an idea what might be wrong here?

 I have no prior knowledge about CSS. I would like to modify this template and have it match my employer's company Look and Feel for documents (fonts, page layouts including footnotes, footers...).
 Question: where can I find newbee compatible doc about what works with org/css/htmlize and what does not. I probably search with the wrong terms since I always get links to css frameworks (Tailwind, bulma...).
 What I do miss is - how to add a background to the first page of the pdf - how to add a different one to the other pages - how to add author's information (name, company, copyright...) on a last page...
 ... all this based on the headers or properties of my org document.
 Reading the file htmlize.el did not help.
 Can you please help me or point me in the right direction?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using org-roam-capture or org-roam-node-find and entering a name into the minibuffer that does not already exist as an org-roam node, a capture buffer pops up in the previously selected window. If another window exists, the buffer that was originally where the capture buffer now is is moved to the other window, and the buffer originally occupying the other window is buried. How can I prevent the behavior of burying the buffer in the other window.
 For clarity, currently what happens when a capture buffer is pulled up is as follows (assume the selected-window initially is the one with B2 occupying it):
 Original Window Arrangement
 ----------------------------------- |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| |------B1--------|-------B2-------| |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| ----------------------------------- 
 After capture buffer pops up
 ----------------------------------- |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| |------B2--------|-----CAPTURE----| |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| ----------------------------------- 
 Here's what I would like to see after the capture buffer pops up:
 ----------------------------------- |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| |------B1--------|-----CAPTURE----| |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| ----------------------------------- 
 In other words, I only want the capture buffer to pop up in the selected-window, and I want the rest of my window arrangement left alone. How can I accomplish this?
 This behavior persists even if I make the window B1 occupies dedicated. I'm not sure if that's relevant to the problem or not, but I'm curious as to why that happens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, ya'll.
 So, I've been an Emacs user for about 5 years now, and have been rocking Spacemacs so far. I love it. It be Emacs. But also Spacemacs. But! Whenever I've wanted to make customizations to Spacemacs, the whole layering system is so abstracted from standard Emacs stuff that it was often difficult to figure things out in regards to online sources often using vanilla Emacs for their instructions. But I made do, eventually figuring things out as best I could.
 Recently, I've been learning CLisp (and plan on learning Clojure as well), and I've wanted to start taking advantage of the true power of the dark side of the Force Emacs, which is, creating an editor that's very much specifically tailored to you, because as I want to do certain things, I definitely feel the edges of Spacemacs pushing back.
 For the past few weekends, I've been following along with Emacs from Scratch from System Crafters, looking at some of Prot's stuff, reading the manual where needed, copiously using `describe-function/variable/etc`, reading a bunch of configs that I've found that people have mentioned as being inspirations for them. Things are moving along mostly smoothly and I'm making really great progress and it feels really fantastic to start slowly tailoring things to how I want them....
 ... but then I look at the setup for, say, Clojure, in something like DoomEmacs or Spacemacs or some Emacs expert's config, and I start to feel a bit overwhelmed because, here's a thing that an entire community has worked on to optimize and hack away at and improve and I'm just barely scratching the surface. And as much as I'm really enjoying the journey of customizing GNU Emacs, I'm also a very practical dev and really recognize the benefits of a distro.
 And in moments like these, I kinda just retreat back into Spacemacs because, damn girl, so much work has been done on it!
 Any sage advice on how to tackle this whole process better?

 But my question is more related to the algorithm. 
 Basically, as I understand it, the problem boils down to basically doing DP on trees. We need to select some nodes from the tree that maximizes a sum based on the condition that if we select a node, then its parent cannot be selected (based on "whose immediate boss is also at the party will not have any fun at all"). Thus, I take it that immediate means direct parent only right? 
 To help you out, here's a tree diagram. The green checkmark represents nodes that are selected. Bob is selected despite being grandparent to John and Sue, and it's perfectly fine right?

 The reason I ask this is when I was comparing my solution (https://github.com/aditya211935/CIS-194/blob/main/week-8/Party.hs#L32) with other solutions (https://github.com/OctaviPascual/cis194-IntroductionToHaskell/blob/master/homework-08/Party.hs#L83), almost all of them in the case where we don't take current element, don't take max of both values of the subtree, but only take the second value. 
 I checked a lot of other solutions and all of them have some bug or the other, so I'm unable to verify my solution. Would really appreciate any help in verifying my solution. For context, my solution on parsing "company.txt" produced "33200".

Again, this is a terrible hack, you probably shouldn't use it, you may not even want to look at it, I rarely use python, but it was able to do what I needed in OSX, so here we are. I also don't know much about OSX specifc stuff and mostly treat it as *nix.
I run this as a daemon, and get a file on a ramdisk (thanks to Christian for pointing out this probably shouldn't be on disk, especially since /tmp is not a ramdisk on OSX AFAICT).

 (require 'eieio) ;;; Define the superclass (defclass super () (a)) ;;; Define the subclass (defclass sub (super) nil) ;;; Create an instance of the subclass (defvar my-instance (sub)) ;; `t' as expected (sub-p my-instance) ;; t ;; I would expect to get `t', but get `nil' instead (super-p my-instance) ;; nil 
 Questions: - Is this the expected behaviour? (or is something going wrong) - Why is the behaviour occuring? - How can I get the behaviour I expected?

 I included the CC in the ./configure line, like so: CC=gcc-12. The reason I'm asking this question is because I've noticed that some people use a separate export CC="gcc-12" command.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bufferbin provies a "Treemacs"-like experience for buffers. It is unique from other packages in that:
 1) It is contained in a sidebar (versus traditional window), making its location deterministic (and customizable) whenever toggled.
 2) It allows the user to specify which window to use and prevents "random" windows from getting overwritten.
 I hope others find it helpful!

 I'm new to Haskell and eager to dive into the language. Initially, I followed the instructions on haskell.org to set up my Haskell environment (GHC, GHcup, Stack, Cabal) and used VS Code as my editor. However, I encountered several issues along the way and decided to start fresh.
 I came across an older post recommending this guide (https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/get-started/) for setting up Haskell. Is this guide still relevant and recommended for beginners?
 Additionally, I'd appreciate advice on choosing the right editor for Haskell development. Which editor or IDE would you recommend for a beginner like me?
 Thank you in advance for your insights and recommendations!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some distributed protocols, servers (actors) transition between different roles at different times, and accept different subset of messages depending on the role.
 Ideally, an actor should always hold a reference to another actor typed in such a way that it is impossible for it to send the wrong type of message (i.e., a message that the other cannot accept because it is in the wrong role).
 The inherent problem is that, like I said, an actor can change role over time, and so the subset of messages it accepts; thus, all other actors holding a reference to it would actually start to hold a wrongly typed reference.
 Specifically, I am thinking to Raft consensus algorithm, where (for example) a server in follower state would not accept an AppendEntriesResponse message, but it is going to be able to accept it as soon as it transitions to leader state. If the behaviors are parametrized with a Raft type that comprises all messages (including AppendEntriesResponse), then it is easy to wrongfully send an AppendEntries to a follower.
 Does Akka have a pattern for this?
 Does this pattern also apply to actors running in clusters? Does it apply to both types of communication (ask, tell)?
 I know that it is possible for an actor to explicitly ignore some messages, but I believe it can become a bit cumbersome and perhaps prone to errors. Moreover, it does not eliminate the issue that I described above.

        <updated>2023-07-08T20:02:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.16 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Copilot has been used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA's Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.
 This new version provides comprehensive tests for the C99 backend, and introduces a breaking change in the definition of the type Arg in copilot-language. For details, see [2]. The new version is already available on Hackage [4].
 As always, we're releasing exactly 2 months since the last release. Our next release is scheduled for Sep 7th, 2023.
 We are also extremely excited to announce that Copilot has received full approval for release as NASA Class D open-source software. Current emphasis is on increasing test coverage for the two remaining libraries without tests (copilot-language and copilot-theorem), removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo [3].
 There have been many updates on the Copilot front in the last few months. We'll be able to announce more soon. Stay tuned. Happy Haskelling!
 Ivan

 Every few months I check the NEWS file for the master branch of Emacs to keep up with anything that'll be useful to me. This time around, I discovered a built-in way to have a right-aligned modeline! (Added April 1, 2023.)
  
Modeline elements can now be right-aligned. Anything following the symbol 'mode-line-format-right-align' in 'mode-line-format' will be right-aligned. Exactly where it is right-aligned to is controlled by the new user option 'mode-line-right-align-edge'.
  
Put simply, all modeline elements following mode-line-format-right-align are right-aligned (according to the mode-line-right-align-edge setting). My modeline looks like this:

        <link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/14ttke9/how_to_touch_file_in_dired_mode/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-08T04:24:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found this answer:
 ``` (eval-after-load 'dired '(progn (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "c") 'my-dired-create-file) (defun create-new-file (file-list) (defun exsitp-untitled-x (file-list cnt) (while (and (car file-list) (not (string= (car file-list) (concat "untitled" (number-to-string cnt) ".txt")))) (setq file-list (cdr file-list))) (car file-list))
  (defun exsitp-untitled (file-list) (while (and (car file-list) (not (string= (car file-list) "untitled.txt"))) (setq file-list (cdr file-list))) (car file-list)) (if (not (exsitp-untitled file-list)) "untitled.txt" (let ((cnt 2)) (while (exsitp-untitled-x file-list cnt) (setq cnt (1+ cnt))) (concat "untitled" (number-to-string cnt) ".txt") ) ) ) (defun my-dired-create-file (file) (interactive (list (read-file-name "Create file: " (concat (dired-current-directory) (create-new-file (directory-files (dired-current-directory)))))) ) (write-region "" nil (expand-file-name file) t) (dired-add-file file) (revert-buffer) (dired-goto-file (expand-file-name file)) ) ) 
 ) ```
 here. It does what I like, which is that pressing c will create a new file in dired mode, but what I don't like is that it's by default named untitled.txt. For example, if I press c in dired with this inside ~/.emacs.d I get Create file: ~/.emacs.d/untitled.text, but what I want is Create file: ~/.emacs.d/ so I can pick the name myself. How can I accomplish this?
 I tried editing the code myself but it didn't work as I expected. I'm not very familiar with Elisp.

 The problem is that id is totally useless not only because I refer to the main heading (so domain/otherfile.html is equivalent) but also the html file does not contain any div with that ID, so even when I refer to a subheading instead of the file, the ID does not work. 
 Is there anyway to change this behaviour? I expect it to link to the file only (without ID), however, when a subheading is refered to instead of the main heading itself, then a working id should present.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately, I've been playing with Lisp (Racket) for a different perspective, but the amount of things I'd have to implement from scratch to build systems with similar functionality to what I'm used to seems rather massive - and with much worse performance (both in container size and resource usage).
 Haskell seems to have the opposite problem: too many frameworks and options! Could someone suggest a roadmap of interesting frameworks/libraries which manage the complexity of modern web services with novel (compared to Go) paradigms?
 Starting with "Learn you a Haskell" seems good. But afterwards? I've seen books like "Production Haskell", interesting examples by James Carlson, frameworks like Mu, Servant, Legion, (although Haskellers seem to shun frameworks like Gophers). I'm looking for the most "different" or "paradigm shifting" option to get me out of my comfort zone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've noticed that Emacs seems to treat ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE as a word character. You can even see that if you do M-x describe-character:
  position: 4297 of 5814 (74%), column: 3 character: ﻿ (displayed as ﻿) (codepoint 65279, #o177377, #xfeff) charset: unicode (Unicode (ISO10646)) code point in charset: 0xFEFF script: arabic syntax: w which means: word to input: type "C-x 8 RET feff" or "C-x 8 RET ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" buffer code: #xEF #xBB #xBF file code: #xEF #xBB #xBF (encoded by coding system utf-8-unix) display: by this font (glyph code): mac-ct:-*-Arial-regular-normal-normal-*-13-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#xBD9) 
 Consequently, spell-checkers see words with a no-break space after them as being misspelled.
 Maybe related too: if I have something like ~foo~---bar in org-mode, foo is correctly fontified as code. But if I use an em-dash like ~foo~—bar then foo is not fontified correctly. Is there some way to tell org-mode that — should be treated like a dash?

  $ emacsclient --create-frame --alternate-editor='' emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server? emacsclient: To start the server in Emacs, type "M-x server-start". emacsclient: error starting emacs daemon  I also tried M-x server-start inside an emacs session, and it succeeds, but then emacsclient fails the same as above.
 However, this works:  % emacs --daemon ‘epa-file’ already enabled Starting Emacs daemon. Restarting server $ emacsclient --create-frame --alternate-editor='' Waiting for Emacs...  and it works great, and it lets me even remove (server-start). My question is: what is going on, and do I need to fix anything? I've found that I can even remove (server-start) from my init.el at that point and it still works. Also, what does the epa-file mean?
 The weird part is I can't even find the emacs --daemon when I use the ps -e command and I'm worried I have a few running around due to the server-start and not finding the socket.

 Googling either suggests mouse-save-then-kill, which is not what I want or:
 (define-key global-map (kbd "<S-down-mouse-1>") 'ignore) ; turn off font dialog (define-key global-map (kbd "<S-mouse-1>") 'mouse-set-point) (put 'mouse-set-point 'CUA 'move) 
 which no longer works. I think the CUA property does not exist anymore, at least what this person found in cua-base.el is not there anymore.
 I've tried using mouse-set-region and mouse-drag-region but I cannot make it work (and I don't think they are intended for something like that).
 Maybe I should define a function that does set-mark (or cua-set-mark since I'm using CUA) at the point and then does mouse-set-point? Even if this is the answer I don't know how...
 What should I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello emacsers, 
 I am using emacs explicitly inside a terminal (-nw). Do you have any modeline packages that don't look terrible? I tried installing doom-modeline but there was no icon support (even after installing nerd-icons). Any suggestions are appreciated!
 Update: Figured it out. 1) As suggested by u/spudlgo I used use-package to install doom-modeline and run nerd-icons-install-font in emacs. This downloaded NFM.ttf in .local/share/fonts 2) Run fc-cashe -fv to update font cashe and then fc-list | grep .local/fonts . This makes a list of all the fonts in the directory. One needs to note down the name of desired font. 3) I opened dconf editor and searched for 'fonts' under terminal folder. The terminal profiles are going to pop up. I copied the name of the font I wanted to the 'font' bar. 4) change the terminal profiles and it's done.
 Note that the changes need to be done in the local machine. I tested it after using ssh to connect to the server and icons appear as intended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am new to the eamcs and orgmode in general but i know that you can extend link types. But i don't know enough to implement it myself. 
 Does anybody have a script that uses id's for linking between two files and after id use an internal link.
 For example
  [[id:b7b07a14-5dbb-48ed-9d9d-70df49e83231:a heading][Heading]] 
 Here a heading won't work because its not supported method by default. 
 If anybody has a script that works on these type of links please share it with me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi 
 Here’s getting started with Haskell using devenv.sh:
  
Pick from a wide range of GHC versions.
 Get stack/cabal as part of the dev environment.
 Get Haskell Language Server for the chosen GHC.
 Enable any linters/formatters as part of the hooks.
 mac/arm, mac/intel, linux/arm, linux/intel.
  
$ devenv shell
 …

 In the near future we plan to create nixpkgs-haskell, in similar style of nixpkgs-python, to expose all GHC minor versions released in the last years.
