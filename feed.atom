I would like for treesit highlighting defined in treesit-font-lock-settings to take priority over lsp-semantic-tokens highlighting where they disagree, but I'm really struggling to figure out how or find a case where somebody else has already done this. Does anyone have advice on how to handle this problem?

For context, right now I use kitty+tmux and neovim to do most of my note taking and general linux stuff. This includes compiling and writing in LaTeX, script writing, etc.
 For context: I've used emacs in the past and like emacsclient + the other useful tools emacs has to offer out of the box, but it hasn't seemed really sensible to me. DistroTube recently came out with his series on building a sensible config from scratch which I've played with for a bit, but I don't want to fully commit if what I want isn't possible.
 What I am looking for: - ability to act as a terminal - pdf viewing with latex editing side by side - being able to navigate to other workspaces to view pdfs and navigate through them with vim-like binds - extensible (which emacs is) - ability to integrate zettelkasten with a pdf open in another pane/split within the same program
 The general idea I want is it do everything I need to do school/productivity wise within emacs, and nothing else. My current setup works, but I like seeing what else is out there. Let me know how doable this would be.
 Please go easy on me I know there's probably a post like this on here once a week. :')

 Is there an API for doing this with some examples for doing this? Currently I use EXWM and regular GUI program windows do show up and I can use them normally, but I need something native to Emacs and not based on XCB or other windowing modes used by Emacs programs.
 I suspect that Xwidgets (GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual) and An Emacs Dynamic Module for WebKit may be working along such lines but I need simple examples that are not so web-focused.
 I am not even sure whether my concept of forms in GUI Apps conform to what Emacs calls native widgets.

 - If the numbers match, congratulate the user, otherwise ask if they wish to continue
 - If the user wants to continue, go to step 1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I write Rust using eglot and rustic and it works great! I can jump to the definition of an identifier with xref-find-definitions, and I can see the type of the binding with eldoc or with inlays.
 However, I don't know how to quickly jump to the type of an identifier?
 Rust uses type inference a lot, so the concrete type is often not spelled out in the source code. This means that I don't have the type to use as a starting point. An example:
 rust let foo = build_me_a_foo(); 
 Here I would like to be able to jump to the Foo type which build_me_a_foo presumably returns. Today I do this by jumping to the definition of build_me_a_foo and then jump further from the function signature.
 Reading the Emacs manual, I see that I could use C-u M-. to get a prompt for the identifier to jump to. The very large list presented to me does contain what I need, but I need to spell it out based on what eldoc showed me in the mode line.
 Has anybody written the code to look up the type and then feed it directly into C-u M-.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I have a question regarding ghc bootstrapping. It used to be the case that you could build an unregistered ghc for a new platform by compiling to .hc files. Copying the build dist over to the new platform and then using a g compiler to build them.
 I am wanting to port ghc to a platform with a c compiler, but no gcc or llvm port. This seems like the best option if it’s still working!
 Anyone know anything helpful?
 Edit: I realise that Hadrian makes this hard…. I’d need a cross compiler to create the build program on the target system….
 Edit 2: I think Hadrian would have to be adapted to generate hc files and makes files. But in all seriousness, isn’t this a good idea? It’s a bit of a barrier porting ghc to new platforms if the bootstrap process involved digging up ghc 6 and working up to 9.
 Thanks!

 I'm making fun in my life implementing Parser (and it's really fun), but i would like to ask following.
 i have Parser a :: Parser String -> Either String (a, String)
 let's say i have a list of parsers ps = [p1, p2, p3 ...]
 How can i push input string through all of them, and i'm looking for 2 solutions:
 Alternative (so we get first successful result)
 Chain (so i apply them one by one and output from p1 is input for p2), and its successful only if all of them are worked.
 I think this is pretty simply, but my brains are old, i have 39' temperature and need to solve it to feel better.
 Here is gh, code is located in lib/Parseme.hs

 // KeyValueStore.scala trait KeyValueStore[F[_, _]]: def put[K, V](f: F[K, V])(k: K, v: V): F[K, V] def get[K, V](f: F[K, V])(k: K): Option[V] def getOrElse[K, V](f: F[K, V])(k: K, default: V): V = get(f)(k).getOrElse(default) def values[K, V](f: F[K, V]): List[V] object KeyValueStore: given KeyValueStore[Map] with def put[K, V](f: Map[K, V])(k: K, v: V): Map[K, V] = f + (…]]></summary>

Anyway, I thought I’d take the opportunity to discuss some of

For now I'm using only parent-child dependencies; i.e. I've set org-enforce-todo-dependencies to t so that attempting to move a task to a DONE state is blocked if the task in question has child tasks that have not yet been marked as DONE. And I have that working fine...
 ... but only if I to try to mark the task as DONE using C-c C-t (which runs (org-todo &optional ARG) ).
 But if instead I try to mark the task as DONE using S-<right> (which runs (org-shiftright &optional ARG) which will in turn, "on a headline, switch to the next TODO keyword" then the task in question gets switched to the next keyword, including DONE if that's next in the sequence, regardless of any children still being not DONE. In other words, it looks like the process triggered by S-<right> ignores the value of org-enforce-todo-dependencies.
 Is that how it's supposed to work?

I've seen a couple videos about the power of emacs org mode and I'm very interested in using it myself. My current setup is 1 laptop running windows 11, a boox note air 2+ running android, and a iphone running iOS. For me, I would like to use my e-ink tablet to markup lecture slides, take notes etc, and have it sync to all my devices. Would syncthing be good for this purpose? Accessing emacs from my phone would be a big plus but I've heard that this is easier on an android phone. 
 As of now I have no experience programming (planning to learn python in my free time) and don't really know what a text editor is or really what emacs is as a whole. 
 I would also love to use emacs org mode for: 
 -planner 
 - TODO lists 
 Any help on how to go out this would be greatly appreciated.

 void stack_push (int val, stack* s) { element* e = _make_element(val); if (!e) return; e->next = s->head; s->head = e; }; 
 If you know a style that looks like that, or the main Elisp commands to get it looking like this, let me know.

 I'm new to Emacs (been using it for less than 3months) and I haven't touched Elisp that much (only for setting up some packages and configuration).

 $<message>*<checksum>\r\n 
 And in my tests I need to write the message, and then compute the checksum over message. A simple byte-wise or. There are websites for this, or I could write a script - but that always means leaving emacs, copy-and-pasting around.
 But this is an extensible editor! This snippet does it for the marked region and inserts at point.
  (defun deets/nmea-checksum () (interactive) (let ((checksum (format "%02X" (apply 'logxor (mapcar (lambda (c) c) (buffer-substring (mark) (point))))))) (save-excursion (insert (format "*%s\\r\\n" checksum))))) 
 There's some obvious extensions like ignoring a leading $, ensuring I'm always appending at the end, and possibly even replacing an already existing checksum with the new one. But even in this most basic, cost-me-5-minutes-to-build version it's a productivity boost and just plain joy for me :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know there are problems with Emacs (29.1) and the current version of GnuPG (2.4.X), causing Emacs to hang indefinitely when trying to access GnuPG tools (like saving an encrypted file). 
 Until now, the only workaround was to downgrade GnuPG (and by the way, this script fails as well). And since Homebrew doesn't have 2.4.0 version, I went all the way down to 2.2, however, the problem persists and I can't save encrypted files from Emacs. 
 I've tried on two M1 machines (both with macOS 14.2.1) and I get the same behavior. Since (fset 'epg-wait-for-status 'ignore) is dangerous and can corrupt your file, what else can I try?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I don't know the name of something, I love being able to M-x and start typing and orderless finds stuff, including the stuff where I have the names ordered wrong.
 This morning, I wanted to make a new org-roam node so I SPC-m-f (org-roam-node-find) and enter the name of the new node: Archiving in Org Mode. Unfortunately, there is already a node named OrgMode Archiving and that's what was selected. Here is my config:
  (use-package orderless :config (setq completion-styles '(orderless basic) completion-category-defaults nil completion-category-overrides '((file (styles partial-completion))))) 
 Orderless finding that node would have been fine if I had a way of canceling its choice and telling it to use what I typed instead. Usual cancel keys ESC or C-g didn't do the job.
 ​
 Solved: Thanks everyone. The completion was Vertico. I had set M-k as previous in Vertico, and that was indeed what was needed- select what I typed and not the entry Vertico found. I'm a simple man, up arrow is easier for me to remember.

 GNU ELPA stands for "Emacs Lisp Package Archive", which is a repository of packages created by the GNU Emacs community. In order to submit a package to the GNU ELPA repository, a package must be licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and require a copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to be included in core Emacs. NonGNU ELPA allows for packages to be included without the copyright assignment, and while it does not go into core Emacs, it is still an official and popular archive for Emacs Lisp packages.
 GNU ELPA and NonGNU ELPA are both enabled by default but since MELPA is an unofficial archive it isn't and requires you to manually install it. Despite it being an unofficial archive, MELPA is still managed by the Emacs Lisp Package Archive Team, and it has a strict screening policy, so only high-quality packages that meet the licensing requirements can be included.

I'm using pgtk emacs 29.1 on wayland (gnome 45, running the emacs-wayland package on arch linux, but also happens with custom-built emacs 29.1 on pop_os). The tab-bar renders halfway like this, and the bottom half flickers in and out. It only happens when I have an internal-border-width set on the frame (currently via the spacious-padding package).

 edit: I installed the non-pgtk version to test, and I see that the tabs are right at the top of the frame in that version, so maybe a pgtk bug with tab-bar positioning?

 I used to consider it as non-pure because it reads a hidden state C1 , which is not a parameter of this method.
 But someClass.someMethod(v1, v2) is a method. The real function in terms of FP should be something like someMethod(someClassAndItsImmutableProperties, v1, v2) , then C1 is part of the parameter.
 So someClass.someMethod(v1, v2) is a pure function. Is my understanding correct?

 org-timeblock
 https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock
 Emacs package that provides interactive multiple-day timeblock view for orgmode tasks.
 Also, might be used as a tool for timeblocking productivity technique.
 Changes
  
Added mark commands (mark-block, unmark-block, mark-by-regexp) for timeblocks that can be used to reschedule multiple tasks at once
 Replaced ts.el with built-in time API
 Replaced org-ql with own searching and caching functions
 dom.el is now used instead of regexps to fetch and change SVG data (much cleaner code)
 Deadline timestamps are now treated as it should be, not as events
 Now, each active timestamp in a heading body is displayed (as event), not only the first one
 Added custom variable org-timeblock-files
 Other minor bug fixes and improvements 8)

 When I type certain keywords, such as \begin or \section, they are turned into unicode symbols. Please see the screenshot for examples.
 This behaviour could have been fine, except that they don't seem to function. For instance, the "section" symbol does not create a section in the document.
 It looks like it might have something to do with the input method for TeX, since I can find the symbols as "translations" of the keywords when I look there. Please see screenshot.
 I don't encounter this problem when using emacs -Q but I also cannot find a LaTeX related culprit in my config, so I'm at a loss. I experience the behaviour both on my personal Linux computer and on my work Mac.
 Does anyone know what might cause this behaviour and how I can disable it?
 In case you think there might be something in my config and want to help me out by having a look, it's available here.
 EDIT:
 Thank you for the help! Turns out it was related to corfu's autocomplete. Setting corfu-auto to nil resolved the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some may remember me asking about migrating my TiddlyWiki instances to org a while back. I'm now actively working on that conversion, starting with the two relatively small instances. Once I have those done and have learned from my many anticipated mistakes, I'll tackle the journal for my day-job.
 My question is this, and it's not necessarily TW-centric: for those of you with comparable situations, do you use one larger (centralized) org file, or one master file that mostly contains overview/contents and links to a number of smaller files, one per topic?
 I'll give an example: one my my TW instances is for my FOSS projects (mostly modules, mostly for Perl at this point). I have about 17 separate topics in it, each one ranging from 5-6 lines of text to the largest being about a full page by itself. Would you folks be more inclined to have a single file (a la the original TiddlyWiki), or break each topic into its own sub-file?
 I realize that org is going to be capable of jumping around a large file as easily as it can jump between files, at least that's the impression I've gotten. I guess I'm interested in what people find works best for them?

 Is there a way to use evil AND emacs keybindings.
 If there isn't a way, is there a way to do things like move to the first character of a line, format (like you do in vim by selecting and pressing "=")?
 Edit: I have only followed the basic emacs tutorial and found a few useful keys here and there. I've been using it for a week and I think I'm going to stay.

I really like this as a writing environment and use it whenever I can get away with it. 
 The document class is Koma-script scrartcl that I have set up an export for. I have no math or images here, but would just use the standard math font for that - I like it when math glyphs look different from text glyphs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone successfully configured Emacs to run without freezing on macOS?
 On my macOS, Emacs exhibits random freezes, and this behavior varies across distributions like Emacs-Plus and EmacsMac. These freezes don't seem tied to any specific package. And when it freezes, i can only force exit the whole process.
 I THINK EmacsMac tends to freeze more when in fullscreen mode on an external monitor. But each time I think I've pinpointed and resolved the issue, it unfortunately resurfaces.Most stack traces aren't very enlightening, often showing repeated calls to functions like 'mac_gui_loop', 'dispatch_semaphore_wait_slow', and 'redisplay_internal...'.
 Is there anyone who can run Emacs on macOS without experiencing these freezes for >1 day? If so, what hardware are you using? Did you use any special configurations or fixes?
 Does native-compilation or any other flag influences this?
 I plan writing an article about Emacs on macOS, aiming for a stable and consistent environment. However, the inconsistency of these freezing issues makes it difficult to offer solid advice. Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

TODO Wash car 
 <2024-01-14 +1m>
  
After completing the task, I type c-t c-d. Because the task is repeating, org-mode typically reschedules the task one month into the future. However, when I typed c-t c-d, the status of the task changed to DONE.
 Without changing any of the syntax, I typed c-t c-t, which toggled the status back to TODO. After typing c-t c-d again, the task rescheduled one month into the future, as expected.
 I have been unable to replicate the error. Any explaination?

Anyway, to explain this UID, 13 for literature, 8 for George Chapman being English, 1 for George Chapman the author/playwright himself being the first author and 0 will be for Shakespeare. )

  
14000 - Philosophy

  
1401[book#].[Stephanus number(paragletter)]Folgezettel# - 1 for The Republic, 0 for Plato

  


I have two separate systems going, apparently, in two categories under Humanities. But they both reflect something important, I feel. 
I was wondering, does anyone else use their UIDs to tell them information about the card? I'm also using a date at the top, in case I can't figure out where to put it when I first make the card [YYMMDD, of course.] Like, the way i use 8 to mean "England/English" or 9 to mean "France/French" under across History and Literature. Alternatively, 0 could mean Greece and 1 for Plato in the context of Philosophy's 14018.532b1. Just thinking aloud.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross posting this from Discourse:
 I’ve been looking into Haskell’s data ecosystem. There seems to be a lot of foundational work that is missing that I’d like to help implement (if such efforts already exist) or start to implement with a group of Haskellers who have time. Namely:
  
A flat buffer library - the current one is abandoned and isn’t featured in the official flat buffer documentation despite some seemingly niche language called Lobster being supported.
 an Apache Arrow compatible data frame library (along with the rest of the apache arrow suite)
 A well supported plotting library
  
I think this was somewhat initially the vision of dataHaskell but that effort seems to have fizzled out. Were there learnings published somewhere? What were the pitfalls? Is there still activity in the community?

 I'm having issues with doom emacs, when trying to use dap-mode.
 I have a working launch.json, I know it works because vscode can use it to start its own debugger,
 but when I try to start in emacs with M-x dap-debug, I get the following error message:
 user-error: Have you loaded the ldb specific dap package?

 Any tips? Thnaks!

Why?
Any app that renders URLs as clickable links can now become your external app or file launchpad.
🎉 Create open-file-with-app links anywhere!
🌎 Assemble dashboards to your projects in your favorite note-taking app!
For example, you can use this in almost any Markdown editor with syntax highlighting to get a clickable link that will open TextEdit:

 By the nature of this habit, it can either be done (I get out of bed before 7am) or I may fail (I stay in bed until after 7am).
 The point is that if I don't manage to get out of bed by 7am this task should not appear as an overdue todo the following day as if I could still do it for the previous day. I want to mark it as failed on the day it was scheduled and also see it as a failed / not done state in the habit graph of the org agenda. Any ideas how this is typically done in orgmode?

So I was wondering whether GHC has this kind of optimization or not. It seems that the Maybe and Either types are used frequently for error handling so such optimization can give big performance benefit.

 The tricky part is keeping them within the width of the window and truncating the text of a particular column when the text that would go on that line exceeds the self-imposed width of said column.
 I have something relatively working by mapping through the list and truncating the relevant strings from the data based off of calculations and inserting them into the buffer.
 This isn't bad but, at larger amounts (say, 15,000 lines), things slow down, taking about a half a second.
 I've written it so the data is inserted into the buffer and, then, manipulating the text to get the truncated version directly in the buffer (saves about a tenth of a second) but it's stil…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time using TypeLits and Proxy. I want to convert bytestrings to fixed length vectors and have the vectors length be known on the type level.
 import GHC.TypeLits import Data.Proxy import qualified Data.ByteString as BS import qualified Data.Vector.Fixed as VF import Data.Word (Word8) class KnownNat n => ValidByteStringLength n where byteVectorLength :: Proxy n -> Int byteVectorLength proxy = fromIntegral (natVal proxy) instance ValidByteStringLength 128 instance ValidByteStringLength 256 -- Add instances for all lengths I want to support -- A type alias for a fixed-length byte vector type ByteVector (n :: Nat) = VF.ContVec n Word8 byteStringToByteVector :: forall n. ValidByteStringLength n => BS.ByteString -> Either String (ByteVector n) byteStringToByteVector bs | BS.length bs == expectedLength = Right $ (VF.fromList :: [Word8] -> ByteVector n) . BS.unpack $ bs | otherwise = Left "ByteString length doesn't match the target vector length" where expectedLength = byteVectorLength (Proxy @n) 
 However, I get
  • Couldn't match type: Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont.Peano (n + 1) with: Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont.S (Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont.Peano n) arising from a use of ‘VF.fromList’ 
 Here, S refers to the successor of its type argument, but does that not mean that the Peano numbers are equal? Does this happen because the compiler does not reduce it to n+1, rather than S(n), and conclude they are the same? Is this a bug? Am I overlooking something?

 If I run a python script on my .org files which creates a new .org file with all TODOs that meet certain property conditions (i.e. all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work')--will emacs consider these TODOs in the new .org file the same as, or different to, the TODOs that were originally copied?
 So, if I had a TODO in .org file 1, and python copied it to .org file 2, would emacs view these as separate TODOs? Basically, if a dynamic block called all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work', would this TODO appear twice?
 I ask because my specific workflow will likely require me to do something like this, and I am wondering if there is a way to do so without emacs thinking they are different. Might one way of doing this be to assign each TODO a unique identifier (UID) so that when I copy a TODO, the UID is copied too? Would this solve the issue of emacs possibly viewing both items as separate rather than the same?

 It seems like a great package, however, I am trying to get around a minor inconvenience. Whenever I press enter on a buffer in ibuffer-sidebar, that buffer opens after splitting the window which contains the previous buffer into two. I would like to change the behavior to have the new buffer take up the full space. Any suggestions how I could achieve this?

 i have following code in my neovim config how can i replicate these in doom emacs in evil mode i read the map! macro docs but i cannot understand how can i do these
 ```lua vmap <c-v> "+p (ie pasting in insert mode with C-v) vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', 'o', 'o<esc>', { noremap = true }) vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', 'O', 'O<esc>', { noremap = true })
 lvim.keys.normal_mode["<C-u>"] = "<C-u>zz" lvim.keys.normal_mode["<C-d>"] = "<C-d>zz"
 vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<space>ii', '1z=', { noremap = true , desc = "fix spelling" }) vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '<C-a>', '<cmd> norm z=1<CR>', { noremap = true, desc = "fix spell ins mode" })
 keymap('v', '<space>g', function() local text = vim.getVisualSelection() tb.current_buffer_fuzzy_find({ default_text = text }) end, opts) ```
 these are - maping o,O to go to normal mode after creating new line - while doing C-d also center the buffer - in normal mode when cursor is on a wrong spelling fix it by replacing to closest match - similar keybinding in insert mode - select a word in visual mode and then fuzzy match its presence in live grep of the whole buffer
 if help me solve these issues it will give me a good direction on how to do similar things in future. Thanks :)

 Typst is a fairly new typesetting language which purports to be a more modern alternative to LaTeX. 
 Based on the VS-code extension https://github.com/Enter-tainer/typst-preview, I wrote a minor mode which gives a live preview while you edit your files (a la impatient mode). Feedback appreciated!
 Aside: There's already a fair amount of support in emacs through `typst-ts-mode`: 
 https://git.sr.ht/~meow_king/typst-ts-mode (link is currently down due to sourcehut problems)
 and the lsp `typst-lsp`: https://github.com/nvarner/typst-lsp, which seems compatible with lsp-mode, so the typst writing experience is slowly catching up with auctex!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org tables to keep track of stuff. I have a number of field formulas that calculate stuff, some based on fields in other tables and others are simple mathematical expressions. If I add a row, say in the middle of such a table, all absolute field formulas below the added row will be broken since all field references will be off by one. I use relative references in some places to "sum the five rows above" etc, these do not break. Below is an example of formulas:
 @3$2 = remote(table1_77,@>$2) @15$2 = ceil(8126/12) @16$3 = vsum(@-9$2..@-1$2) @21$3 = vsum(@-3$2..@-1$2) @34$3 = vsum(@-11$2..@-1$2) @37$3 = vsum(@-1$2..@-1$2) @39$2 = ceil((6770/12)*0.44) @43$2 = ceil(184*0.44) @45$3 = vsum(@-6$2..@-1$2 @49$3 = vsum(@-2$2..@-1$2) @59$2 = ceil((4050*4)/(12*2)) @61$3 = vsum(@-5$2..@-1$2) @71$3 = vsum(@-8$2..@-1$2) @72$2 = vsum(@3..@-1) @72$3 = vsum(@2..@-1) @72$5 = vsum(@2..@-1) @73$2 = @-1$5-@-1$2 
 All field references on the left of '=' are such that can break when adding a row in the middle. I cannot come up with a way of making them relative and not breaking when adding rows. And I haven't found a way for Org to automatically update all absolute field references below an inserted row. Is there a way to solve this?

At some point everyone tries to learn Haskell and I’m generally a curious person, so I want to learn Haskell now. But I have a few mental issues that are being worked on. Because of that I rarely finish what I start and need someone to push me to do something. I can read documentations all I want then ‘haskell-learning’ will be another orphan on my GitHub. Are there any resources that I can code along, maybe a beginner to intermediate video series where someone implements an app or solves a problem? I guess there are not many because most Haskell devs are really smart and prefer to read. Hmm, I feel stupid, but I still want to know Haskell. I don’t know if this post is welcome here, if not, feel free to delete it. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Emacs friends. I've had a strange keyboard shortcuts issue come up today:
  
2 systems are sharing synced Emacs config
 Both systems have caps lock mapped to act as an additional ctrl key
 Both systems use KDE
 One system will allow some ctrl key shortcuts to be typed with caps lock (see below). C-S-s nope; C-S-d OK, for example.
  
Init.el:
 ;; Let's save stuff more easily ;; This only works on one system when using caps as ctrl. ;; Kubuntu is OK with it--use caps as ctrl, this is fine ;; The other system Manjaro KDE only lets this work if pressing regular ctrl key, even though caps is mapped to ctrl (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-s") 'save-buffer) ;; Let's have the plain date at hand ;; This works fine on all systems when using caps as ctrl, incl. Manjaro (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-d") 'plain-date) 
 I looked through my custom KDE shortcuts but C-S-s isn't mapped to anything that I can see. 
 C-S-x also doesn't work on this system unless I use the regular ctrl key.
 I also restarted Emacs just in case but it's still happening.
 Thanks for any tips to troubleshoot this.
 Edit: Marking resolved since it seems to be a reported hardware issue with some Dell models, more here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that Scala is losing ground. But I still haven't seen the reasons why clearly formulated. I think the best people to answer this question would be the people who have stopped using Scala.
 Questions to those people: 1. Why have you stopped using Scala, or Why are you planning to stop? 2. How much Scala experience do you have? What stack were you using? 3. What would make you come back, or Is there anything that would make you change your mind? 4. One suggestion for improvement. 
 People who are not using Scala may not be on this sub anymore. But in case some are still lurking, it would be great to hear their opinion.
 Please feel free to speak your mind. All answers from former devs are welcome.
 In case you want to share your thoughts anonymously, you can do it via this google form. I will share all the responses in a thread.
 Scala is very close to my heart as long time Scala dev myself. I think knowing why people are leaving + suggestions will really help. Thanks everyone for your input.

I've looked and I can't find a working method to export my .org file into pdf so the table automatically splits where necessary within the pdf. People say to use the long table package but when I include something like "#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment longtable :align |p{7cm}|l|l|" nothing happens. 
 Also, how do I change the table width? I couldn't find a good explanation either :/

 What I'd like to know is what's the format of org-mobile-capture-file (mobileorg.org by default). It appears to me that it does not only contain capture headlines which will be blindly appended to the staging area, but it may also contain some rows that encode some edit events to existing headlines that will be applied when org-mobile-pull is invoked. If that's the case, I'd like to see some concrete instances of mobileorg.org files as an example, if anybody has time to satisfy this little whim of mine.
 Thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to test a function by comparing the return value against static content in test data files. I'm looking to answer the following questions:
 Is there any standard practice/convention for putting test data files? For JVM projects following Maven directory structure, the location is src/test/resources, but AFAICT, there's no such convention in Haskell. So, putting the files inside the test directory, presumably under the same module path, makes sense to me.
 For example, If the code under test is in the module A.B, then putting the test data in the directory test/A/B is fine. If using HSpec, the test module is A.BSpec.
 How to read the test data files? There's no need to list these files in the cabal file, because these are't going to be shipped with the package. Simple readFile test/A/B/file.txt from the test works.
 Can anyone please confirm/correct the above statements?

Removal would be even better so I can save disk space too but it seems to be a too complicated task to be worth it. I asked ChatGPT what to put in my "_emacs" file in "C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\_emacs", and these expressions don't seem to do anything, I'm still able to open calendar, mail, games, etc.
 (setq gnus-init-file nil) (setq gnus-novice-user nil) (setq calendar-load-hook nil) (setq mark-diary-entries-in-calendar nil) (setq tramp-mode nil) (desktop-save-mode -1) (setq org-startup-folded nil) (setq zone-which-screen nil) 
 Are these expressions out of date for this version, am I putting it in the wrong file, am I misunderstanding Lisp, or do they not actually disable them? Other expressions like turning off autosave, changing font and background colors, turning off cursor blink, turning off the bell/error sound and replacing it with visible-bell and so on seem to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I know this question has been asked over and over again, but after reading many articles on this topic, as well as blog posts, orgmode tutorials, and trying a bit on my own, I'm still not sure orgmode fits my needs. Since the orgmode learning curve comes up a lot, I want to make sure it's worth my time. 
 I'm a graduate student in applied mathematics. I'm just starting my master's degree, so I'm looking to set up my workflow for classes, research and personal projects. I'd like to be able to quickly and easily create notes on articles, or textbooks, keeping a journal, organize files into projects, create to-do lists and roadmaps (much like orgmode does perfectly if I've understood what I've read correctly).
 I've never used emacs in my life and I don't come from a computer science background --> I find it very difficult to learn and I have the impression that it will be a long time before I can start using it for real. 
 People keep saying that it's worth learning emacs and orgmode nonetheless because of the unlimited customization possibilities. What are your thoughts on this? 
 Should I be patient and learn to use emacs and orgmode to set up my workflow, or should I just start using Notion or any other simple organization and note-taking app? 
 Note that I don't want a complex setup in the long run, just something minimalist that allows me to concentrate on what's important while having a clear vision of my work.

 What I need is:

 Open and close sidebar with single shortcut

 How can I achieve this?

But why is it so? Why is it that Contravariant doesn't instantiate Functor? On a superficial level, given Haskell's definition of Contravariant and contramap, obviously there don't correspond to fmap's type signature. But why are we forced to define Contravariant in this way? In category theory, there's no doubt that contravariant functors are functors. Does anyone have an explanation?

 I'm currently working with a scala codebase on a REST API that I did not design with the following stack : Scala 2 + Play Framework + Silhouette + Slick (and some Akka actors but I don't think it is relevant here).
 My client (who is administrator on the platform being developed for his own company) got used to login as other users before I enforced some well needed security developments regarding passwords. Long story short was: he created the users with their password so he knew their authentication infos and was able to login in order to "see what they can see", "check for missing features directly on their account", "test out that some specific features would really work for them" in production, etc.
 But! I changed the way users are created, mainly because the passwords he created were way too easy to guess (without even having to brute force, litteraly everyone could guess the passwords, that's why he could remember them in the first place).
 So he can't login as other users anymore, and he would like to be able to "do it again". I already worked on a platform that allowed user impersonation for administrators out of the box but I can't find anything on the internet regarding this subject on the Play framework and Scala documentations or their communities...
 So my questions for you are: have you ever had to deal with an impersonation feature request using silhouette + play framework + scala and if you haven't, do you have any advice to provide on the subject anyway? =D
 Thanks very much for those who take the time to respond!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks,
 First timer here. I'm currently learning Haskell, and I'm practicing doing the Advent of Code 2023.
 I'm a bit struggling with the performance of my solution for 2023 day 6, part 2.
 At first, here's the solution I did a month ago in Go: main.go. Basically, I iterate from 1 to raceTime, and count the number of times where applying a function is bigger than a specific value. Note that raceTime can be pretty big (in my case it's 55826490). The result is executed in a few milliseconds.
 I did the same in Haskell: Main.hs:
 ``` numberOfWays :: Int -> Int -> Int numberOfWays time distance = foldl' (\acc i -> acc + (travelDistance i time distance)) 0 [1 .. (time - 1)]
 travelDistance :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int travelDistance hold raceTime distance = if (raceTime - hold) * hold > distance then 1 else 0 ```
 At first, I used fold and I had a stack overflow. I read here and there what the issue was so I switched to foldl'. Yet, this version runs in more than 20 seconds compared to only a few milliseconds in Go.
 I'm not at all comparing Haskell and Go, but I'm trying to understand what makes my solution so slow and how to improve it. Note that I have seen versions in O(1), fair enough but I don't want to implement a solution with better time complexity. I'd like to stick with an O(n) solution for now, to understand what I'm doing wrong.
 Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi all, I'm going through the elisp tutorial book. I got to the exercise to write an interactive function that doubles a parameter but have hit a stumbling block
 (defun double-param (number) (interactive "p") (* number 2)) 
 This is the function I wrote. After running C-x C-e after the function (unlike without interactive) I can use M-x double-param but after hitting return it does not wait for input for the parameter. It simply exits with nothing in the echo area. Similarly I cannot use C-u 3 M-x double-param to send it the parameter. However, it still works if I call it with (double-param 3) for example I'll see 6 *#o6, #x6, ?\C-f) in the echo area.
 What am I doing wrong? I'm guessing my understanding of what the "p" character modifier to interactive is wrong. Is there a different character to pass to interactive that will behave correctly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who, like me, have to share their days between Emacs and one of IDEA's IntelliJ-based products, I recently published the first version of an IntelliJ plugin called EmacsJ. It could perhaps be of interest for some people here. While the Emacs keymap in IntelliJ is actually pretty good, there's enough differences that my Emacs-marinated fingers stumble too often while using IntelliJ. So the plugin is meant to be an extension of the existing Emacs functionality, offering around 40 commands that either modify existing IntelliJ commands to be closer to Emacs, or are pure additions to the IntelliJ commands.
 The plugin only makes these commands available, and you can use whichever ones you find useful, either by adding keybindings one-by-one, or by using the EmacsJ keymap installed by the plugin which is an extension of the Emacs keymap and activates all the commands at once.
 The main features are:
  
Incremental search modelled on Emacs' Isearch, with text and regexp search.
 Query-replace as in Emacs with text or regexps, with a very light-weight interface.
 Word commands: transpose, upper-case, lower-case, capitalize, move, delete.
 Rectangle commands: copy, open, clear, paste.
 Whitespace commands: delete space around point, delete empty lines.
 Easy access to clipboard history à la Emacs (kill ring).
 A mark history with ability to pop mark (mark ring), and exchange point and mark.
 Duplicate and comment regions and lines.
 Recenter and relocate caret.
 Zap to character.
  
​
 The plugin is of course free and open source.

But I've come across some Data Engineering positions that accept Scala as previous experience. However, the recruiters dismiss me on the spot when reading my Resume. 
 Usually, the job description describes the tooling required, such as Airflow, Spark, Flinck, etc. I have some previous experience with Spark and Hadoop. But somehow it seems insufficient to start a conversation. 
 Can anyone provide me with some hints on how to start this focus shift from Development to Data Engineering?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm starting with ZIO Http, in the past I used Akka Http, Play, and Http4s.
 So, I visited the official site on github: https://github.com/zio/zio-http
 Latest version is 3.0.0.RC4 ... so I will skip version 3 for the moment.
 Therefore I will try previous version of ZIO Http .... but in maven repository (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/dev.zio/zio-http) there are no version 2 or version 1 ... jumps from 0.0.5 to 3.0.0-RCx ...
 Where are versions 2 and 1? In github official site I see the following:
 NOTES ON VERSIONING:
  
Older library versions 1.x or 2.x with organization io.d11 of ZIO Http are derived from Dream11, the organization that donated ZIO Http to the ZIO organization in 2022.
 Newer library versions, starting in 2023 and resulting from the ZIO organization (dev.zio) started with 0.0.x, reaching 1.0.0 release candidates in April of 2023
  
Check in maven repository, search for "io.d11" (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.d11/zhttp) but all versions 1 and 2 are "RC" ...
 ​
 So I'm kind of lost ...
 - I don't want to use version 3 because latest version is "RC"
 - But I'm not able to find versions 2 or 1 ...
 ​
 Am I doing something wrong when searching versions?
 Any suggestion?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all!
 Super quick question. I love building ghc cross compilers, but I am struggling a bit since the switch to Hadrian. I can’t find enough information on the process to understand it. E.g. what is the role of the configure script now? Do build.mk options do anything?
 Has anyone got either an overview of this, or alternatively some scripts to cross build ghc that I can study?
 All the best!
 Bonus Question: can you still bootstrap ghc from .hc files? I’m wanting to port GHC to 9front and I a cross c toolchain looks like a pain.

 I am trying to dive back into emacs after installing nix, ensuring some reproducibility. 
 After starting prog-mode in the scratch buffer, the letters "C-x C-f" were highlighted beautifully. After some digging I found that they are the output of the function "substitute-command-keys" 
 I was playing around with it and tried to evaluate (substitute-command-keys "String \\[abort-recursive-edit]"). This gave me the output #("String C-]" 7 10 (font-lock-face help-key-binding face help-key-binding)) 
 My question is, how can I get the output displayed with the "help-key-binding" face applied to "C-]" 
 Thanks,

 I've upgraded my personal project to use Scala 3 (precisely Scala 3.3.1).I'd like to take advantage of opaque types, though, even if Doobie is in the latest version that seems to support Scala 3, it doesn't know how decode the opaque type into a String, ZonedDateTime or any other reference/composite type (works with primitive types) when using the type in a Fragment or Sql interpolator e.g. in an Insert query.
 Found: (price : com.marryfied.bandservice.domain.model.Band.Price) Required: doobie.syntax.SqlInterpolator.SingleFragment[?] band <- sql"insert into bands (name, price, address_id, created, updated) VALUES ($x, $price, $addressId, $created, $updated)" Found: (name : com.marryfied.bandservice.domain.model.Band.Name) Required: doobie.syntax.SqlInterpolator.SingleFragment[?] val updateBandQuery = sql"update bands SET name = $name, price = $price, updated = $updated where id = $id"

 Here's the gist: https://gist.github.com/wjoz/b88d206826501ce3bf6915508e17613a (Look at PostgresBandRepository) 
 Is there any possibility to define custom mappings so Doobie knows to treat an opaque type e.g. Name or Price like a concrete implementation e.g. a String and decode it properly? 
 I also may be doing something wrong, so any help in figuring it out is highly appreciated :) 
 Thanks in advance!

Basically all I want is one folder with multiple projects that stores all my pipelines, 1 commons project that sets up databricks configs and being able to build all projects into individual jar files. Has anyone attempted this or is there a better way to structure it? Should I use sbt-typelevel to create my project?

I tried using gradle task rules - mustRanAfter, shouldRanAter and DependsOn, all seem to apply the rule within each individual module but not across the whole project.
 Is it even possible to run all UTs across all modules and then trigger a new task with gradle build? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I work using a local emacs instance running on my Mac and ssh to a remote machine. The two do not share a filesystem - i.e. any server files created on the Mac won't be immediately visiable on the remote. 
 I've been trying to call emacsclient on the remote and have that open a frame on the local emacs instance. This used to work for the longest time (by accident?). I was recently noodling with my setup and suddenly it no longer works :) 
 I've been attempting to do the following from https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/emacsclient-Options.html : 
 local$ ssh -R12345:localhost:12345 remote 
 remote$ export EDITOR="emacsclient \
 --server-file=server \ 
 --tramp=/ssh:remote:" remote$ $EDITOR /tmp/foo.txt #Should open in local emacs.
 where I've copied the server file (from local Mac to remote) just ahead of trying.
 ​
 Any tips on how to get this work again? Quite a big part of my flow and hate having to use $EDITOR=vim on the remove :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! As a new Emacs user, it seems that I have joined in exciting times with the adoption of treesitter + LSP (which also was my setup in neovim). I have spent some time customizing and slowly get the hang of how minor/major modes work.
 From what I saw, a major mode defines syntax rules for highlighting (similar to treesitter), on-the-fly error checking with flycheck (similar to LSP) and some setup, such as indentation, etc.
 I understand that TS + LSP are still being actively developed and integrated into Emacs and so I accept that the experience using these tools might not yet match that of established major modes. So I am mostly curious about the future.
 If you were to start coding in a new language in Emacs, what would your setup look like? My thinking is to install the treesitter grammar and the LSP plus minor modes for navigation and editing (e.g., lispy for elisp). Would TS + LSP be used instead of the language major mode or in conjunction with said major mode?

Emacs opens a split window where file_b is in the left window and file_a is in the right window. Without issuing a command to swap the two windows, is there a setting that will cause emacs to open the file_a file in the left window and file_b in the right window? The convention that emacs uses appears to make the last file specified on the command line as the main buffer (which is the left window in my case).

 Its is possible to share your elisp function for the migration?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've started using lsp-bridge after months of fighting with eglot and lsp-mode. Both eglot and lsp-mode are great projects, but they have their quirks, and for me, most of them revolve around how slow and how prone to timing out they are, as well as the massive memory footprint that they cause (I've had both of them spawn clangd processes that end up consuming 20-30GB, and so far lsp-bridge is keeping under 10GB, which is fine). This isn't their fault per se--I'm working on an Unreal Engine project and there is just so much going on all the time, and I can easily believe that parsing JSON is the bottleneck. (I know there's a new-ish project that tries to solve that problem for lsp-mode, and I will definitely try that one day if this experiment with lsp-bridge doesn't work out.)
 So, two questions:
  
Can I jump to the (header) file under the cursor, or like lsp-mode, cause that header to become a link to the file?
 I have some functions and classes that seem inaccessible because they're wrapped up in a namespace. This isn't true of everything in a namespace, just a few things. That means I can't jump to classes/functions defined in that namespace, and I also get no completion information back. This wasn't the case with eglot or lsp-mode, so I don't think it's a fundamental limitation of clangd.
  
Other than that, so far, I'm pretty impressed. I'll work out some keybindings and wrapper functions to see if I can get the functionality that I'm missing, but for jumping around the code, it's significantly more performant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately I've noticed that new frames (e.g., created with emacsclient -nc) don't come to the front with keyboard focus on them. I'm now on Mac OSX 14.2.1 (Sonoma), but I think it started happening before Sonoma upgrade. This behavior also shows with other programmatic ways of getting new frames (make-frame, yequake, etc.)
 Has anyone else noticed it, or solved it hopefully? 
 I'm up to date on osx (14.2.1 Sonoma) and emacs: 
 (emacs-version)
 "GNU Emacs 29.1.90 (build 1, aarch64-apple-darwin23.2.0, Carbon Version 170 AppKit 2487.3) of 2024-01-07"

 I think there should be a rule requiring properly formatted code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An elisp question. I have lines in my nnmail-split-methods using rx like this:
 ("mail.git" (rx bol (or "From" "To" "Cc" "Resent-From") ":" (* anything) (or "@github.com" "@gitlab.com" "@pdfbox.apache.org"))) ("mail.pro" "\\(^From\\|^Cc\\|^To\\|^Resent-From\\):.*\\(me@mine.com\\|@example.com\\)") ("mail.hummon" "\\(^From\\|^Cc\\|^To\\|^Resent-From\\):.*\\(thing@example2.com\\)") 
 The first line, with "mail.git", is the form I would like these things to be. I cringe at the repetition in each of them as I have the same headers bit that I want to replace with the (rx bol (or ...)) bit everywhere. But I can't figure out the syntax to generalize that. In Clojure I could whip up a little let-bound function and use into to pull it off; what is the elisp solution to being able to stick the same rx code inline everywhere? I'm imagining (rx headers (* anything).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get a nice setup for LaTeX/Overleaf rolling, and I really like how GhostText and atomic-chrome let me just edit my browser Overleaf live rather than worrying about keeping a local git repo up-to-date with collaborators' changes. I was wondering if there's any way to get citar working with this setup though?
 At the moment whenever I use M-x citar-insert-citation in a LaTeX buffer using atomic-chrome, I get the message "RefTeX works only in buffers visiting a file". That seems conclusively like a dead-end to me, but this old comment from /u/T_Verron does imply that it is possible. (it also implies my setup might not work so well for collaborative editing as I thought it would, but I'm crossing my fingers that things have improved in the last two years)
 Can anyone point me in the right direction on a possible workaround? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellows,
 I am using Org Mode while learning about Guix via the fabulous Dissecting Guix series, employing Code blocks to visualize what it is I am talking about. However, I noticed two things that REALLY bug me out.
 First off, when I load the org file containing said source blocks, it is slow to the point of unusability UNLESS I first start GEISER-CONNECT with an instance of GUIX REPL hooked up. This leads me to believe that it is independent of org mode and has to do with the fact that it searches for the code to which the blocks reference. Nonetheless, input on this is highly appreciated
 Second, when I use TAB (for org-cycle), I am asked for the currently used scheme implementation - despite the fact that both related geiser variables, geiser-active-implementation and geiser-default-implementation only contain guile. When I choose guile, then the source block contents become read-only, and all subsequent editing needs to happen in a separate Org Src buffer. I have no clue why this is the case.
 I have come to the point where I commented out all code blocks to not have to deal with it, which is obviously not acceptable in the long run. Thus, any input is appreciated :)
 Have a good day, fellows!
 EDIT/SOLVED: I found out the source of the problem. At one point I had opened a lot of files related to Guix and then saved the Desktop file. Then, loading the file would load all those other files including all modes related. For some reason I don't quite understand this literally ground emacs to a halt performance-wise.

 One thing I don't like most is there is no parentheses and comma in function calls. When a line contains several function calls with each having more than one arguments, your brain will be burdened to identify the "parse tree", while in popular languages the parentheses will save you this effort.
 I don't think there is mathematics base for this kind of designation. You can argue this is concise or elegant. I may also think the same way if I stick to Haskell for a while. But I'm afraid this can be one of the reasons Haskell has not been more popular - a developer from another language with passion of FP comes here, only to find he can't tolerate the syntax and finally leaves for other FPs. :-)

 This is a dangerous variable, so I don't want to just add (org-confirm-babel-evaluate . nil) to my safe-local-variable-values, because then any file would run its code blocks without asking me.
 I thought of putting org-confirm-babel-evaluate in a .dir-locals.el file, but now I get asked whether I want to set it when .dir-locals.el is loaded, rather than when my org file is loaded.

 eglot--error: [eglot] Unsupported or ignored LSP capability `:implementationProvider' 
 The particular capability varies with what I am trying to do, but in short, even though I can connect to racket-langserver, any attempt to use eglot cross-reference features results in an error message like that above with each of the capabilities. I am using a vanilla configuration based on Emacs Bedrock. The pertinent parts of my config are here
 (use-package racket-mode :ensure t) (use-package eglot :hook (((c-mode c++-mode python-mode elixir-mode gleam-ts-mode racket-mode) . eglot-ensure)) :custom (eglot-send-changes-idle-time 0.1) :bind-keymap ("C-c l" . eglot-mode-map) :bind (:map eglot-mode-map ("a" . eglot-code-actions) ("r" . eglot-rename) ("h" . eldoc) ("f" . eglot-format) ("F" . eglot-format-buffer) ("d" . xref-find-definitions-at-mouse) ("D" . eglot-find-declaration) ("i" . eglot-find-implementation))) 
 I've checked the eglot events buffer and don't see any requests going out. The only message I get back is the error mentioned above.
 This happens to me in Racket, but I've seen the same problem in other languages like Elixir. I should note that these features do work with other editors/LSP clients like Neovim and Doom Emacs. Am I missing some crucial configuration?

I use doom, and after my most recent upgrade & sync when I invoke org-capture and org-roam-capture, the capture buffer (which prompts with [t] for todo, [n] for note, etc) now overwrites whatever buffer I'm working in, rather than creating a minibuffer to handle the capture. It also doesn't seem to respect the custom capture prompts that I have attempted to shamelessly copypaste from a blog configure. Thankfully it's not a fatal issue since a single undo restores the contents of the buffer but it's very strange and annoying! Has anyone else experienced this issue or perhaps know of a fix? Snippets from my config.el pertaining to the aforementioned functions below. All help appreciated and thank you in advance!

Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
EDCI445 Young Adult Literature is about to start.
I'm studying techniques for capturing "Idea Flurries."
Reviewing 2023 and setting intentions for 2024.



I'm trying hard to slow down to interrogate and chew my thinking thoroughly. He/She who dies with the most notes doesn't win. The goal is a rich and fulfilling life.

Zettelkasting randomness and disorder, and how it is surprising that these lead to knowledge.
Things I'm reading:
Parrish, Shane. Clear thinking: turning ordinary moments into extraordinary results. 2023.
Garmus, Bonnie. Lessons in chemistry. 2022.
Tucci, Stanley. Taste: my life through food. 2021.
Music I'm listening to:

Japari Park
Jazz,  Jazz, and more Jazz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm hoping to be able to yank text into the eat terminal. In my init.el I have 
 (setq eat-enable-yank-to-terminal t)
 I've tried char-mode; semi-char-mode; line-mode. Text does get yanked into the buffer, but eat doesn't do anything with it. It doesn't fontify, the cursor remains in place, I can't edit the text, it won't be processed as a terminal command. After pressing ENTER, the yanked text moves to the next line with the cursor, but remains useless.
 What am I doing wrong here?
 (I'm using EXWM, if that matters!)
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Zettlers,
I am in the process of restructuring my training regimen to align it with the new role of fitness in my life. (You can have a badly translated version of my last article here)
I am building an inventory of training stimuli for that. I am doing something similar like a factor analysis. For many years, for example, my aerobic endurance (roughly, what you normally associate with endurance if you are not into sports science) training was distributed over many different other training sessions that you'd normally not associate with aerobic endurance. Like that I could skip long sessions of running, biking etc. and use that freed up time and energy for other training while still having a solid aerobic base (for recovery between bouts of intensity and between exercise sessions).
I thought that I'd create something similar for knowledge work. Examples are items like reading physical books, attributes like screen time (to highlight a benefit of physical books over ebooks) or requirements like daily empty time slots (like my dog walks in which I do nothing, but just listen to the sound of the world).
So, what should be considered?
Live long and prosper

 ``` emacs-lisp (defvar company-mode/enable-yas t "Enable yasnippet for all backends.")
 (defun company-mode/backend-with-yas (backend) (if (or (not company-mode/enable-yas) (and (listp backend) (member 'company-yasnippet backend))) backend (append (if (consp backend) backend (list backend)) '(:with company-yasnippet))))
 (setq company-backends (mapcar #'company-mode/backend-with-yas company-backends)) ``` and i tried to put this

 I wrote the former based on what I have read in the docs here, but it still does not work as expected.
 I'm running Emacs 27.1 on a Pop!_Os system. Can anyone help me figure this out?

 Is there an analog to Haskells undefined or Elm's Debug.todo, allowing me to skip implementing functions while keeping the compiler happy? I just found an older Github issue suggesting this, but maybe I'm using the wrong queries in the internet search?
 I think type holes is not really what I want, as it kind of goes the opposite way around, right?

 I think elfeed-score can access this data in order to rank posts. I would for instance like to use this to score elfeed entries based on the length of their content (e.g. shorter posts ranked higher), but I haven't quite been able to sort this out.
 But more generally, is there a package that can search through the entry content? I don't think Elfeed alone allows this, but I'd be happy to be corrected.

 i am very new to emacs and org-mode. in fact i just finished watching the google talk by the creator.
 i found an app called Orgzly which seemed to work really well in the phone, and it even has a feature to set alarms. but it doesn't seem to work. 
 i put the time in the scheduling as well as in deadline but it seems to only triggers a notification.
 it's not a deal breaker and i could see my self replacing all my Obsidian notes to org. but i was just hoping to trigger an alarm so that i can plan EVERY PART OF MY DAY 😭😌
 thanks for the great software, and thanks for any help

 If you're tackling the tedious task of modeling language or country concepts and you're already utilising the Enumeratum library in your project, I'd suggest considering these two libraries: scala-iso-language and scala-iso-country. 
 They offer a minimalist and standardized approach and have some translation capabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[please keep in mind that i’m very new to emacs and i've been using doom to get a feel for how emacs works, and thank’s in advance.
 so i just moved from neovim to emacs and loving it so far. but i’m having an issue configuring it to suit my workflow for python and django.
 so what i wanna do is replicate the workflow i’ve used in vim which is:
 configure pylsp with plugins pylsp-ruff and pylsp-mypy and then have isort and black handle formatting without lsp interference.
 and i also want to configure mypy globally in my config to check if there’s a (venv, poetry or conda) env active and and use that env’s python executable
 and bonus, if i could also get help setup a function to run django tests from emacs.
 i know my question seems like a tall order, but i’m really loving Emacs and doom and hope i could finally find a solution so that i’m able to stick with Emacs.

 In that light, I made a video showing how they are useful when taking notes. Specifically, I used ekg (my module in GNU ELPA) to come up with a way to get Aeropress recipes (Aeropress is, to me, kind of like the emacs of coffee brewing), and take notes how they taste. The video shows the entire process.

Opening the same file in a browser (Brave), the diagram is shown. Also, when opening random SVG files found on the internet, they work perfectly in Emacs. Where to start finding the underlying issue?

 Because I am using GNU gettext I do have flake8 errors like this. I don't want to put an extra flake8 config file into the repo.
 I don't know how Emacs/eglo/pylsp do invoke flake8 in the back. Is there a way to inject '--builtins="_"' commandline option somewhere in there?
 *EDIT*: It seems that a ".flake8" file in the repos root folder is also ignored.
 [flake8] builtins = "_"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a MBP 2019 16" Intel, 64GB, I9 and running Ventura 13.6.3.
 Intellij Idea is the latest version as of now, Build #IU-233.13135.103, built on December 19, 2023. I allocated max. 12GB to the VM running IntelliJ
 What I am experiencing?
 When I edit scala files in a small size Scala project (roughly 40 files, scala source code + few files generated from the play framework) using playframework 3 & anorm, basically IntelliJ goes nuts, i.e. the CPU usage goes up, the fans rpm go to the maximum (I run TG Pro) to the point where I cannot type continuously - I keep typing, and the characters don't show up for a few fractions of second, then they all appear at once. Clicking anywhere in the editor or in the user interface has a lag. I am using the default JDK that comes with IntelliJ. Cmd+Tab doesn't respond immediately, or it is frozen for a moment then the selection moves quickly a few more icons to right.
 I tried VS Codium + Metals to edit the same project and it is more responsive but I don't like it as much as IntelliJ.
 I also run a Windows 10 VM in desktop parallels and, believe it or not, I installed the same version of IntelliJ and it is more responsive than the mac version. I think I am going to continue on windows in the short term.
 I am just curious about few things if you don't mind sharing your experience:
  
do you use Intellij on Linux and if yes, what is the performance like, assuming that you don't run it on apple hardware?
 if you run IntelliJ on a newer mac with the apple CPU, what is the performance like?
 any suggestions/recommendations on how to improve the performance of IntelliJ on the mac?
  
And just a side note, because I read the MBP 2019 16" intel has some problems handling external monitors, I should mention I do use an external 4K Dell monitor, but I do not experience the problems described in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlUmnVYPcKM .
 Thank you

 It allows everyone (since 2022, before that it was only students) to contribute to projects for a stipend. However, in order to do that, we need to have some ideas of what to contribute to.
 In the past, this has led to many improvements for GHC, Cabal, HLS, Hasktorch... and it can include your project as well! This is a great way to find contributors for your project (even after the summer ends) -- many past participants have become involved long-term.
 You can find more info and instructions on how to participate here: https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've been running into this problem a lot: Ruff gives syntax error hints even though everything is correct. After "M-x eglot-reconnect", everything goes back to normal again. Below is a screenshot.

 In this case, Ruff reports two errors that don't exist: 1. ruff [E701]: Multiple statements on one line (colon) and 2. ruff [E999]: SyntaxError: Unexpected token Indent. "M-x eglot-reconnect" solves the problem.
 I want to report the problem but I'm not sure which component (Ruff, Flymake, Eglot, python-lsp-ruff or python-lsp) causes this problem. Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know why but I am just having a really difficult time wrapping my head around the Emacs window manager. I can't seem to translate what I have in my head into code, which is an unusual and frustrating experience for me.
 What I'd like to do is, when I'm specifically working on a Python project, have my frame set up so that there's a main window with the buffer I'm working on, then to the right is a python REPL, and to the left is a switchable choice between an xrefs list and a directory tree. What I'd like to do is set up the position and sizing of all of these by mouse-dragging them to how I want them, then saving that configuration somehow. Then, crucially, having this configuration and sizing be entered when I visit a python buffer and python-mode launches, and exited back to "normal" emacs when I leave python-mode except in a couple of instances.
 Has anyone done something like this? If so, could you share your config? I don't know what it is about Emacs's window manager but each one of these requirements has so many moving pieces in different parts of the system that I just have trouble wrapping my head around the whole.

 I'm asking for recommendations on libraries to create an interactive canvas: basically, a window where I can draw/update the score and click on different elements in it, and also receive keyboard input. Not a GUI in the sense of menus, widgets or anything of the sort; just an interactive canvas. 
 Now, if memory doesn't fail me:
 - the OpenGl bindings take mouse and keyboard events, but it's perhaps too low level.
 - the Cairo bindings are nicer to work with, but to put them on an interactive screen some Gtk lib was needed; but even with that, would I only receive mouse click coordinates? I don't mind writing some square object detection, but I wouldn't mind a simpler route if there was.
 - ability to import svgs would make my life easier, probably.

 At a single press of the F5 key -- or whatever you wish to make it too -- your project will be compiled. 
 I have examples for a number of languages -- Ruby, C++. Rust, Go -- but they are highly configurable and you can add your own.
 This works with your git projects. It will go to the root of your git project and execute the necessary commands to compile your entire project. Well documented with examples.
 If you hit the F6 key, you will be presented with the compile string that you can then edit on the fly.
 I should get this in Melpa. I tried a long while back, but the maintanier of Melpa insisted that I do a pull request instead with smart-compile, that schlau-compile is derived from. Except at that time I had made so many breaking changes a pull request would not have been feasible. And now? It has completely diverged, as I have added quite a few features and changed the workflow. It is its own project now, and I should approach Melpa again to include it separately.
 Let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy New Year!
I follow Sascha's advice to use object tags: https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/
In the following note, I have used the object tags: "#good-technician #mediocre-boss #human-capital".
I often encounter this situation where I want to refer to a specific entity (e.g. a good technician), so I use adjectives to be specific about it. But I don't know if this is good practice. The other options I could use are:
use two tags: "#good #technician".
use only the core of the idea: "#technician".
What do you recommend me to do?
Because in this note, I just want to refer to good technicians (I don't want to talk about technicians in general). Therefore, I think that's the object to define with the tag. But I could be wrong :^)
# 202401060957 Turning a good technician into a mediocre boss destroys human capital
#good-technician #mediocre-boss #human-capital

In companies (public or private), one way to progress economically is to
acquire responsibility for the work of others: to move from being a technician
to being a boss.

However, the skills that define a good technician are different from those of
a good boss.

This causes many good technicians (motivated by economic incentives) to become
mediocre bosses: they do not have the skills needed to be good bosses.

For the company, this situation destroys human capital value: we have turned
a good technician into a mediocre boss.]]></summary>

 Collaboration is essential in project management. org-jira is a good solution for that. But Jira isn't open source.
 Collaboration is possible using git with people mastering org mode. But for me, org mode isn't a generic FOSS project management solution if I should use it in a real situation, because I need use a property solution(Jira) for the collaboration in team.

 Will org mode community integrate org mode with Plane in futur, or exist already such project in progress?

 I am a project manager, but before that, I was a software engineer, mostly working with .NET and later Objective-C/Swift (iOS).
 After 3-4 years as a project manager, I am thinking about ‘going back.’
 Writing software is much more fun than managing projects 😅😀
 So, I would like to learn Scala.
 Besides the book from Odersky and rockthejvm course(s), are there any other resources that I should consider for a beginner?
 Any advice for an ex-software engineer? 🫣
 Thanks in advance.

 I tried the following command, but mill errors out with Code: 401  mill mill.scalalib.PublishModule/publishAll <artifact>.publishArtifacts --sonatypeUri https://maven.pkg.github.com/<user>/<repo> --stagingRelease false 
 Can anyone point me to steps I can follow (or a tutorial would be nice) to publish a JAR on Github packages?
 PS: I come from the Python world. Compared to pypi, things in JVM appear very confusing, with terms like maven central, sonatype, ivy, (and to a lesser extent) artifactory and bintray thrown around a lot. (I think) I understand maven-central, as being the de-facto repository (so kind of like pypi) that hosts most of the publicly available packages. I have no clue what others are for, or if I need to learn about them!

 This was my random COVID project and after 4 years of feature creep I've finally released it. There's still a lot more I have planned and this is intended to be a useful app and not just a for fun project. Hope y'all enjoy.

Is this simply a configuration thing? 
 ​
 without parametric polymorphism

 worst of all, most of the added information is redundant! I think that F# did it correctly here (please ignore the portuguese bits): 
 Visual Studio F#
 In this one you can clearly see the most generic form of the function, but it also has a list of all the parameters and their concrete types.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been an emacs user for years, that said, I've barely touched elisp. Now, I want to update hyde.el to work on the latest emacs, and I'm having trouble the following part
 (defun hyde/load-posts () "Load up the posts and present them to the user" (interactive) ;; Clear the buffer (toggle-read-only -1) 
 It seems like (toggle-read-only) does not exist on emacs 29. Changing it to use (read-only-mode) makes emacs complain about the buffer being read only. 
 For what I can tell, I need to change the mode to read the read only and then inhibit it while I do some buffer manipulation. But these seems kind of elaborate for something that seems (to me) like common behaviour.
 Could anyone please comment on what the correct approach is to create a mode where a buffer displays data that is read only (and then have commands that do stuff on the data but mostly dont modifiy the buffer at all)?
 The code I'm trying to update is https://github.com/nibrahim/Hyde/blob/master/hyde.el, more info on https://github.com/nibrahim/Hyde/ with a relevant screenshot.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to get some color in an example block exported to beamer by doing something like the following
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE case when \textcolor{red}{condition-1 then value-1} when condition-2 then value-2 . . . when conditionn then value-n else value-z end #+END_EXAMPLE 
 According to this post on the tex stackexchange site, a verbatim enironment can get color by adding the commandchars argument, i.e.
 \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}] a (black) \textcolor{red}{b} (I want this letter to be red) \end{Verbatim} 
 Unfortunately I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get commandchars option set in the example block. I've tried adding a #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [commandchars=\\\{\}] above the example block, modifying the begin example line as #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :options commandchars=\\\{\}, #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :commandchars \\\{\}, and #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :options [commandchars=\\\{\}] and none of that has worked. How should I get color in my example block. Also, is there some reading material somewhere where I can find how to properly pass options/keywords/attributes to org-mode for exporting purposes. The org mode manual hasn't exactly made a lot of sense to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post will not probably have enough information for troubleshooting, but the issue is rather bizarre, so I'm sharing it anyway in case anyone has any advice.
 My Emacs is emacs-mac GNU Emacs 29.1 (build 1, aarch64-apple-darwin23.2.0, Carbon Version 170 AppKit 2487.3) of 2024-01-04, installed with brew install emacs-mac --with-librsvg --with-mac-metal --with-native-compilation --with-natural-title-bar --with-unlimited-select
 My installed packages are committed to a git repo and they are a mix of melpa and melpa-stable with the preference for the latter.
 Yesterday I was upgrading packages (I have to apologize if this and a few next steps are vague as I was not keeping a log) and for some reason had to restart Emacs, which then gave me an error on (require 'lsp-clangd) that it couldn't be found. I check the load-path and see that lsp-mode is no longer its part, even though it was a user selected package. I do a package-reinstall for it, restart Emacs and it no longer starts: on mac, the icon jumps at the bottom of the screen for a second and goes away. Adding --debug-init isn't helpful. Since my package directory is versioned, I git restore it, and it does not help, neither does deleting the ELN cache.
 Then I wipe my package directory and install user selected packages one by one, and everything goes fine until I get to helm-org. Install it, and Emacs fails to start. Restore an older copy of package directory (not using git restore) which does not have it, Emacs starts. This package has been installed for ages without any issues before.
 What is this I don't even. Of course for now I fixed my setup with helm-org removed, but how do I get to the bottom of the issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I defined the following macro to evaluate some expressions after a list of features has loaded, basing it on the with-eval-after-load macro.
 (defmacro with-eval-after-load-all (files &rest body) "Execute BODY after FILES are loaded. FILES is a list; usually it contains feature names, but it can also have file-names, in case a file does not provide any feature. See `eval-after-load' for more details about the different forms of the elments of FILES and their semantics. Do not quote the FILES list." (declare (indent 1) (debug (form def-body))) (let ((output `(lambda () ,@body))) (while (not (null files)) (setq output `(eval-after-load ,(pop files) ,output)) ) (print output) ) ) 
 And used it to execute the following in my config:
 (with-eval-after-load-all ('evil 'undo-fu) (setq evil-undo-system 'undo-fu)) 
 Emacs complains with the following error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable undo-fu) (lambda nil undo-fu)() eval-after-load(undo-fu undo-fu) elisp--eval-last-sexp(nil) eval-last-sexp(nil) funcall-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil) command-execute(eval-last-sexp) 
 The previous macro evaluates to:
 (eval-after-load 'undo-fu (eval-after-load 'evil (lambda nil (setq evil-undo-system 'undo-fu)))) 
 Why is this wrong? Evaluating the inner eval-after-load works, but evaluating the outer one doesn't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I observed lately that there is a lot of division in Scala community. There are multiple groups of users, some more vocal than others.
 This is counterproductive as people have different requirements, tastes, styles, and backgrounds.
 In my view, this goes against what Scala stands for, a Scalable language:
 "A programming language designed to adapt to the evolving needs of its users."
 However, not all users have the same requirements. There is no one solution for everyone.
 Is there a way in 2024 to make the Scala community more inclusive and accept that every group has its pros and cons for the technical choices they make?
 Here are some groups I observed, mainly around async handling:
  
People who try to write everything with IO.
 People who keep using Scala Future.
 People who use plain threads / scala-async / project Loom / direct style.
  
While you may have a preference for one group, we should all agree that there is nothing wrong with choosing one or another. It's just a matter of personal preference and the overall requirements and trade-offs.
 It's essential to recognise that outside the Scala community, some of these paradigms represent the majority.
 For example, Scala Future behave the same as the Kotlin CompletableFuture, the Java CompletableFuture, the NodeJS Promise.
 What's nice about each group is that people coming from Haskell/familiar with IO monad may be at home in group 1.
 People coming from Java/Kotlin/Javascript will be at home in groups 3 and 2.
 People coming from Python will be at home in group 3.
 So, instead of being consumed by division. Can the community be joined by the diversity and cooperation instead?
 It's a Scalable language where everyone can be at home. We all have to win with Scala being a multi-purpose language as it was intended.
 Much love to each of the groups, have a wonderful day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Orgmode, org-preview-latex-fragment turns $\int_0^x \sin x = 0.5$ into an inline LaTeX formatted equation.
 As I under the org-previews-latex-fragment process - Orgmode makes a .tex -> LaTeX makes a .dvi -> dvipng makes a .png.
 But it didn't work - at least not without some massaging. emacs 29.1, orgmode 9.6.15, FreeBSD 13. 
 There were 2 problems. 1) LaTeX couldn't make a .dvi file, and 2) dvipng couldn't make a .png file
 My dirty fixes
  
Orgmode made a .tex file with a line % Package hyperref omitted but hyperref is required by the later line \hypersetup{colorlinks, linkcolor=blue, urlcolor=bblue} . After inserting \\usepackage{hyperref} into org-format-latex-header LaTeX started making .dvi files.
 Orgmode calls dvipng ../../../tmp/orgtexXXXXXX.dvi - where the number of "../"'s is based on the directory depth of the PARENT DIRECTORY of my fiddles.org file (I moved the file, but the number of ../ was always one too few) It looks at /usr/tmp not /tmp. After creating a symlink from /usr/tmp to /tmp, dvipng started making png files.
  
I'm not familiar with Linux, perhaps tmp is in /usr/tmp - but in FreeBSD /tmp is a top level directory. The fix at the moment is a symlink pointing at /tmp from /usr/tmp. Is a little weird though, as LaTeX saves its work into /tmp.
 So, two questions.
  
Is poking a \usepackage{hyperref} into org-format-latex-header the right way to go?
 Is there a orgmode variable used to point dvipng at /tmp rather than at ../../../tmp?
  
I'm very new to emacs and orgmode, but there seems to be a variable for everything - perhaps I'm looking in the wrong places

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have lsp-mode and lps-pyright working on my emacs setup as part of my attempt to get emacs working as a python IDE. I've been using emacs for about a week, and I like it a lot. I have python 3.11.7 installed as part of my Gentoo Linux install. The Gentoo package manager is written in python and I want to maintain a level of separation between my development environments and the package managers environment. To get lsp-mode and lsp-pyright working, I've created a emacs_venv in my ~/.emacs.d/ folder and then pip installed the lsp-server/pyright stuff to that. Then added that environment to my exec-path and set python-shell-virtual-environment-root to that folder. 
 Can I now use direnv to manage project environments? 
 Is there a better way to handle separating the Gentoo environment from an environment that emacs needs while in python-mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've come across Porstmann a few times as the "intellectual father of the A-Series",  the "creator of the DIN formats", and the creator of A4 in various contexts. I saw that he wrote an interesting looking handbook in the mid-1920s and was curious if anyone has come across or even read it? It looks like it went into three editions up to the 1950s. I'm not seeing any English translations at present. I suspect it has material on using card indexes as databases and may be focused on business use, but may also have some connections to note taking practices of the time. I've also found several references to Porstmann's work and that of George Christoph Lichtenberg which makes me even more curious about the potential note taking connections.

 For the Emacs GUI to use JUST ONE WINDOW (in the desktop environment sense) and not open a separate one unless I explicitly tell it to do that.

I have been learning haskell because my mind works more mathematically so i figured i might as well program in a language that is concise with math. I know haskell is used more for industrial and scientific purposes but I am wondering if anyone is using it for more practical everyday purposes like web application dev and or simple desktop applications with a gui. If so, can anyone reccomend some good resources for building simple practical applications with it? Either way I'm interested to know what types of applications people are building with haskell in the broad general sense. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using Emacs for thirty years now, and I obviously have amassed a fair share of crust in my .emacs file. The following config is something I have probably had for at least 25 years now, and I have no idea who the original author was:
 (defun s-scroll-up () "Make pgup behave better (cursor to first line at start of buffer)" (interactive) (if (condition-case nil (scroll-up) (error 't)) (goto-char (point-max)) ())) (defun s-scroll-down () "Make pgdown behave better (cursor to last line at end of buffer)" (interactive) (if (condition-case nil (scroll-down) (error 't)) (goto-char (point-min)) ())) (global-set-key (kbd "<next>") 's-scroll-up) (global-set-key (kbd "<prior>") 's-scroll-down) (global-set-key (kbd "C-v") 's-scroll-up) (global-set-key (kbd "M-v") 's-scroll-down) 
 My question is: is this still needed? It seems to me such an obvious "right" behavior that I would have expected Emacs to start behaving this way out-of-the-box with some release since when I first picked up this config, or at the least offer some customization variable. If there is one, I can't find it, however. Anyone know of a better way of achieving this? (Not that it kills me to keep it).

 I'm new to Haskell and are learning QuickCheck for now. What I knew is to design the property and then it can enable QuickCheck for testing. However, for computation-intensive algorithm function, for example CRC-8 , how do you usually design the property for QuickCheck testing? Is there any tip in how to design the property while using QuickCheck? Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've tried various different ways of saving desktops, including Bookmark Plus and the minimal example in the Emacs Wiki. They're fine, but I would like to be able to automatically save my desktop every few hours (I use Emacs in daemon mode and basically only close it every 3 weeks or so), rather than manually saving it. Doing (desktop-save-mode 1) seems to have the unfortunate effect of restoring the desktop everytime you restart, unless you explicitally tell Emacs not to.
 Is there an elegant way to have auto-save without auto-restore?
 I have two main ideas:
  
Enable desktop-save-mode, but create a shell alias for emacs --no-desktop. This seems fairly straightforward, and I could even add --daemon to the alias since I almost always use that option as well.
 
Create a timer for one of the desktop save functions, e.g. bmkp-set-desktop-bookmark. I'm a little unfamiliar with timers in Emacs but this seems like a perfect use-case for them. I could even time-stamp the desktop file name when the save-function is called.
 
 Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to setup emacs as IDE for my Python projects.
 I'm coming from pycharm where I can set a remote interpreter located in a docker image, this way I only install my dependencies in the docker image and not locally.
 I'm trying to achieve the same result in emacs using lsp-mode, python-mode and envrc and using direnv and container-env.
 I have the following .envrc file inside my root directory 
 CONTAINER_NAME=localhost:5000/myimage:latest
 CONTAINER_WRAPPERS=(python, pylsp)
 container_layout 
 My init.el looks like this
 (use-package lsp-mode
 :ensure t
 :init
 ;; set prefix for lsp-command-keymap (few alternatives - "C-l", "C-c l")
 (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l")
 :hook (;; replace XXX-mode with concrete major-mode(e. g. python-mode)
 (zig-mode . lsp-deferred)
 (python-mode . lsp-deferred)
 ;; if you want which-key integration
 (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration))
 :commands lsp-deferred) 
 (use-package envrc
 :ensure t
 :config
 (envrc-global-mode))
 (use-package python-mode
 :ensure t
 )
 It seems that envrc is loaded correctly so if I run M-x python I got the right interpreter. But the gotodef and autocomplete with packages that are only installed inside the container is not working.
 What I'm missing?

When writing an html attribute then clicking on the right arrow or C-f or C-e or a mouse click, lsp will directly apply a formatting edit, like the following:
 1- By moving the code line about 4 or 5 tabs to the right.
 2- If I didn't yet wrote the closing tag, everything will back to its normal place, once I write the closing tag.
 3- If I edited or added another attribute, the same thing happens without the correction.
 
In the messages minibuffer it says:
 "LSP :: Applying 1 edits to `NewSpaceUpdate.jsx' ..."
 "Applying 1 edits to `NewSpaceUpdate.jsx' ...done"
 
If I click on C-/ it will undo the action.
 
Does anyone know a way to stop this behavior?
  
Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I am trying to write some bindings to a C library called wlroots.
 There is a struct, "wlr_pointer" that contains a nested struct. The struct is declared without a type name inside that struct.
 https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/blob/master/include/wlr/types/wlr_pointer.h?ref_type=heads
 I am trying to write peek, poke, alignment and sizeOf implementations for the Storable typeclass for these struct types in Haskell.
 I'm not sure how to do this, because the pattern isn't the same as some of the other FFI code that I'm looking at. Searching the web for a good reference on how to do this was less than pointless, and the Real Word Haskell section on the C FFI didn't mention nested structs like this.
 The PR that I made that attempted to do this is here, and I doubt it's correct.
 https://github.com/bradrn/wlhs/pull/4 
 I guess what I'm asking is similar to this SO post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8099678/haskell-ffi-for-c-recursive-struct-and-union
 Which I didn't find at first because of my chosen keywords "anonymous" and "nested".

 Is there a way that I can disable these autoloads from being generated on a per-hook basis? Or do what I'm trying to do in a cleaner way?
 The canonical way would be to setup the hooks in the whitespace and company use-package declarations but that's counter intuitive: ``` (use-package whitespace :ensure nil :hook python-mode)
 (use-package company :hook python-mode) `` and even theuse-package` documentation advertises the following:
  
Allow gathering all the configuration details of a package into one place
  
It makes more sense to me to have something akin to the following instead:  (with-eval-after-load 'prog-mode (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'diff-hl-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'show-paren-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'flyspell-prog-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'flycheck-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'yas-minor-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'company-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'electric-pair-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'electric-layout-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'display-line-numbers-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'hl-line-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'bug-reference-prog-mode))

I've found some blog posts etc on how to do this integration with KeePassXC but not for gnome-keyring. Perhaps someone:
  
knows of an auth-source+gnome-keyring reference I've missed?
 would be willing to share their config snippets?
  
I did ask a couple of LLMs for guidance and, true to their kind, they provided information which was voluminous, detailed, convincing...and 100% BS.
 EDIT: Yes, the official auth-source docs included with Emacs do reference KeePassXC and gnome-keyring and dbus Secret Service. But there's not much guidance as to how to stitch things together with that API.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty new here to the singleton library and currently trying to refactor some code that I previously hacked together using Data.Dynamic. To keep the problem as simple as possible, I've boiled down my application to the following (nonsensical) example:
  data Foo = A | B deriving (Eq, Ord) genSingletons [''Foo] class MyConstraint (t :: k) instance MyConstraint 'A instance MyConstraint 'B f :: forall k . (forall (t :: k) . MyConstraint t) => () f = () v = f @Foo -- this does not work, even though forall (t: Foo) . MyConstraint t 
 Basically, I have some function f which for a given kind k (or at least a given list of types of kind k) needs to know that all types belonging to that kind (or in that list) satisfy some constraint. Conveniently, I can express this using QuantifiedConstraints, and make properly make use of that constraint in the function's body. The problem is that I never seem to be able to call that function in a way that it satisfies this quantified constraint, and I don't know how to tell Haskell that it does actually satisfy this constraint forall t :: Foo in this case. Any ideas/suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya! 
 I would like to share with you all a little package package I've written here https://github.com/JasZhe/window-stool for code context. 
 There's a few similar packages out there like lsp/eglot breadcrumbs, treesitter-context, and topsy to name a few but most of them use header-line (or in the case of treesitter-context, a childframe) which is limited to a single line.
 I really liked how context.vim had a sort of "cascading" context style and I didn't find anything similar to it so I figured I'd give it my own shot here. 
 To achieve that, this package uses overlays and so it may not be as performant as others, but I haven't experienced too much slowness personally, even on a pretty old 2017 Macbook. 
 It basically constantly moves an overlay to be at the top of the window to act like a pseudo multi-line header-line. I also opted to use a simple indentation based heuristic for figuring out the context as a default. There's customization options to specify different kinds of context functions depending on the major mode. I've included a simple one for org-mode using headings. 
 In the future, I might try to add some tree-sitter support when I get a chance to dig into it.
 I named it window-stool cause it acts like a little stool that you can use to glimpse the contents above what your window can normally see.
 I've been using it for a little while, ironing out kinks along the way so hopefully there aren't too many issues with others using it, but I'd appreciate any feedback for problems that crop up. Thanks emacs community!

 Scala can be an advanced version of Java. It is more expressive. You can write neat code. All this comes with an acceptable learning curve. Valid choice.
 If you use Scala+Cats, it means you want to do advanced FP. Then why not just use Haskell? Instead of using a tool to turn stones into gold, you can just pick gold...
 And Cats can't make pure gold for you, because there is no linting tool in Scala to enforce the purity. Your teammate can still write functions that have side effects. A mix of pure + impure code is confusing and error-prone.

Now I am managing a team of people, each of whom have their own projects, I am struggling to scale it to this task. I use org-journal to keep notes from meetings, org-capture to add my individual todos. I try and tag the meetings with the relevant projects, but meetings are with people, and sometimes people work on different projects. I have been tagging meetings/todos with people's names, but recently tried org-secretary to add their names as properties, which seems a nicer idea (cleaner, more organised) but also seems less searchable than tags. 
 I would really like to get
 1. an individual overview, that called up for each person the most recent meeting notes and any todos with their name as a tag or property, and then
 2. an overview of overviews so I can scan through - when did we last meet, any outstanding TODOs (for me) or TASKs (for them), and then dip into the individual overview for each. 
 Ideally I could do this by project too (which would just be another tag), but the people view seems most urgent. 
 Are there any suggestions how I could go about this?

I wanted to outline the options I've tested.
  
Using the native Wayland Linux App (pgtk build), it is possible to restore the lost window, sometimes, by clicking on the Emacsclient icon but often you just have to kill Emacs which sucks when you have Python/Julia/R REPLs or other buffers open that you want to continue working on.

 I recently have started learning emacs. I did the built-in tutorial and followed a couple of SystemCrafters’s “Emacs From Scratch” videos, and I’m facing a dilemma right now.
 Of course, evil-mode is hugely popular and has a lot of support, often being called the best vim emulator. Even SystemCrafters uses it, which to me, is a big vouch for using it.
 However, in reading some other reddit posts about others asking this same question, many people said that it had compatibility issues with some plugins, and relying on vim emulators has always left a bad taste in my mouth from other editors. Also, as a new emacs user, I don’t know how much of the emacs experience changes with evil-mode, and I don’t have the knowledge to be able to thoroughly understand and debug any issues that might come up from using it.
 So, I’m mostly just looking for some affirmation and anecdotes, good and bad, about evil-mode: if it will hurt me as a new user, and generally any heads-ups that could help me. Thank you!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing some writing in Emacs and I'm wondering if anyone knows of a package that provides a way to diff two blocks of text, then walk through and accept or reject additions and removals in a granular way, like the track changes functions in major word processors?
 Essentially what I'm doing is having an LLM proofread for me with ob-chatgpt-shell, paragraph by paragraph. It spits out a whole suggested paragraph, so I'd like to be able to compare that output to my input and work through the suggestions one at a time.
 Thanks!

 but i haven't been able to replicate my config in emacs so i've been using pyright temporarily until i'm able to configure it correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 The Haskell Foundation Technical Working Group (TWG)  serves as an advisory organization for both the HF management and the Haskell community as a whole, by evaluating specific proposals for projects that can have broad, ecosystem-wide effects. These proposals can be:
  
Community RFCs that seek the community’s input on a project
 Community projects that will be executed primarily by the proposer, but seek administrative or financial support from the HF
 HF projects that a community member would like us to execute
 Other topics of relevance to the community
  
Volunteers wanted!
 We presently have three openings on the working group, and we’re seeking volunteers. Members are expected to attend a monthly meeting, to participate in and moderate discussion threads regarding specific proposals, and to evaluate proposals for their technical merits. From time to time, committee members may also be asked to help a community member revise their proposal. The ability to communicate well and respectfully is important for any potential member.
 These discussions have a real impact on the Haskell ecosystem, so this is an opportunity to give back in a meaningful way.
 If you are interested, or if you know someone who might be, please get in touch with me at director@haskell.foundation! You don’t have to be a long-term Haskeller, or someone who is deeply embedded in Haskell development - we have members with this background already. If you are unsure as to whether you would fit in, please get in touch, and we can have a chat about it. We would like to have members with diverse backgrounds, professional experiences, and knowledge. All self-nominations must be submitted by the end of the day on Jan 12th 2024.

 I am using intellij with sbt and Scala 3.3.1. I want to see the code that an anorm macro expands to: Macros.parser[<some case class>]. The problem that I have is that, for whatever strange reason, this code triggers a compiler warning: [E029] Pattern Match Exhaustivity Warning for a specific case class.
 I've done some research into compiler options but the options related to macros have been removed in scala 3. See: https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/migration/options-lookup.html and search for -Ymacros.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I suppose the solution to my problem must be fairly easy, but I've only recently started using Emacs for both coding and org mode, and I need some help with my config file.\
 Basically, I have a ".emacs" file that I started configuring through tutorials about a month ago. At the time, all I did was assemble together different elisp snippets from different configurations that I found online and liked. Inevitably, I accidentally created a kind of Frankenstein. My main problem is that I have contradictory information in (custom-set-faces) and (custom-theme-set-faces). Now, when I try to change something, it starts accumulating contradictory information and randomly selecting which one to pick.
 I want to clean up my config file, possibly try literate configuration. The problem is that I fear losing all my current configuration and being left with nothing, having to restart from scratch. Can anybody lend me a hand or share some resources?
 Here's my configuration, if you'd like to take a look. Thanks a lot.

 I use a theme from the doom family, hence the doom-color call.
 This does not work, the cursor color is not yellow when Emacs starts. If I evaluate this piece of code after startup, the cursor will shift to yellow. I suspect this is caused by set-cursor-color setting the cursor color for the selected frame, only.
 The documentation for set-cursor-color says;
 You can also set the text cursor color, for all frames, by customizing the cursor face. 
 I have tried to figure out how to do this, without success. How do I change the cursor color for all frames?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm really excited about this idea of how you can maintain referential transparency and still perform real mutations/effects without having to force something into a monad that you can't "break out" of.
 In Clean, as in any language, monads are possible, but you are not dependent on them and can get the value back at any time, so the complex combination of different types of monads is unnecessary. Monads in Clean are therefore just a helpful tool to facilitate sequences of computations. In Haskell, however, monads like IO seem a bit hacky with their lots of magic in the background, where only the compiler developers themselves probably know how they actually work. This magic has always irritated me and distorted the idea of monads.
 This brings to mind the idea of creating a resource like a file completely referentially transparent as a mere program object, and manipulating it, just as you can do with numbers or other simple values, without actually causing anything outside of the programming. You're just describing the transformations. And only when you actually want to perform all these operations in the real world you add “*World” and continue working with an unique object standing for an entity in the real world.

 As described in the title, I have problems with table alignment in my org files, as you can see in the following example:
 | 1 | 22 | 333 | 4444 | 55555 | 666666 | 7777777 |
 |------+------+------+------+-------+--------+---------|
 | Data | | | | | | |
 | | Data | | | | | |
 | | | Data | | | | |
 | | | | Data | | | |
 | | | | | Data | | |
 | | | | | | Data | |
 ​
 These are my related settings in ~/.emacs
 ;; Normal text fonts. Both variable and fixed pitch
 (custom-theme-set-faces
 'user
 '(variable-pitch ((t (:family "ETBembo" :height 130 :weight thin))))
 '(fixed-pitch ((t ( :family "Fira Code Retina" :height 130))))
 '(org-block ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))))
 '(org-code ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
 '(org-document-info ((t (:foreground "dark orange"))))
 '(org-document-info-keyword ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
 '(org-indent ((t (:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch)))))
 '(org-link ((t (:foreground "royal blue" :underline t))))
 '(org-meta-line ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)))))
 '(org-property-value ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))) t)
 '(org-special-keyword ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)))))
 '(org-table ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch :foreground "#83a598"))))
 '(org-tag ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch) :weight bold :height 0.8))))
 '(org-verbatim ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch))))))
 ​
 ;;Trying to fix tables
 (set-face-attribute 'org-table nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch)
 ​
 ;; Set variable pitch as normal
 (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'variable-pitch-mode)
 ​
 ;; Make me select paragraph size myself
 (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode)
 ​
 I tried changing many different settings, but have seen no improvement yet. Even if I force fixed-pitch with M-x, the tables still won't align properly. Could someone help me figure out what I'm doing wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
I've been getting around the Zettelkasten method for about 2 years, but never dove in.
I've tried several formats.
I've tried a file per each note and numbering it, such as 1.a, 1.a1, 2.a, and so on, but soon all the notes appeared the same to me, and I found hard to detect the paths of the notes
So I've tried a single outline (see the screenshot) because I'm a visual person, hoping to have a visual clue of the structure of the chains of thoughts, but again I feel confused when I see all of those lines.
Furthermore, I need a fast way to insert the new note into the System, because I have no time to get the extra hour each day in order to review the notes (I'm always on the rush).
I also tried a kind of PARA method, thinking of the opportunistic strategy, but I fear I'll have difficulties when searching for older notes.
Any advice is accepted.
PS: a screenshot of the outline...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! Haskell noob here. I don't know the right terms here so please bear with me if I misuse any terms. Thanks! 
 I am looking for an async programming model like boost asio (the proactor design pattern) in haskell. I am not sure how to articulate it for a web search but essentially what I am looking for is to translate a toy asio server in C++ with callbacks to haskell. 
 I can (and did) implement this using forkIO + Chan but I am curious if the following has a name in haskell.
 type Context mkSocket :: Context -> IO Socket recvData :: Socket -> (Buffer -> IO a) -> IO () runContextFor :: Duration -> Context -> IO () 
 Here, each Context should be able to manage its own event backend (epoll, select, IOCP) without depending on the haskell runtime. Ideally, I should be able to run the event loop every once in a while manually. Am I going in the right direction here?
 In spirit of the X-Y problem, what I am trying to solve is a reader on a socket forkIO $ forever (recvFrom sock 512 >>= doSth) should be interruptible and I should be able to interrupt this "blocking" wait on the thread. I guess I can do the following but they don't feel clean
  
by closing the socket and forcing an exception on all readers
 set a socket receive timeout and exit the "blocking" wait periodically
 use a System.Timeout.timeout on a read and poll

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a problem that has a state [Integer], logs a tuple ([Integer], Maybe String) and returns Maybe Integer. If using the transformers library, I'll be working with the following type:
 MaybeT (StateT [Integer] (Writer [([Integer], Maybe String)])) 
 However, mtl doesn't have a MaybeT. It seems there's MonadState instead, but there's no documentation on how to actually use it. In fact, I've searched far and wide, and all I see are articles like "let's make our own instance of MonadState" or "define MonadState from scratch" followed by some fictitious code. After an hour, I feel like punching in their faces and screaming, "FFS don't reinvent the wheel, show me a real example instead".
 Sorry for the rant, but libraries like mtl and articles like the above are cancer for the Haskell community. The only silver living are the good people in the community, that's who I've turned to for help.

I wonder if people here have any other advice or special know-how they have come across? What do you think are the best practices that lead to a nice tidy config that gets out of the way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are cases when I'm on mobile and need to interact with entries of my synced org files. The most frequent example is clocking, which I may do on my smartphone but edit other parts of the document on my laptop in the meantime. 
 This may or may not emit a conflict issue on Syncthing side, which does not goes into the details of wheter the edited parts of the document are disjointed or not. So the question: do you use another synchronization technique that is more reliable regarding this aspect?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a non-programmer who uses emacs for writing (a dissertation) and research. Originally I was writing in LaTeX, now I write in org mode.
 I've found org mode to be a great tool for writing but I'm pretty new to it. I'm curious how other writers incorporate the task functionality of org mode into the writing process.
 So far, I've kept things separate. So I have my document I'm writing in (say a chapter) and I have a separate outline in a different document that I add my TODO tags to (see image).
 However, with this method, if I make changes to the writing document outline (which happens a lot), I have to update my tasks document. Is there a way to have the TODO tags in my writing document and be able to see those headlines in a separate buffer?
 Or is the another way you use TODO tags to keep track of writing tasks?
 All advice is welcome.
 ETA: I should also say that I use narrow/widen quite a bit, which I can do with a separate tasks file. Would be interested if other methods can similarly narrow in.

This is captured in my ZK, in a purposeful way but with random timing.  Each zettel covers one thought or memory and is written following the normal process for producing a pithy, well-considered note.  So far, I have written 35 such zettels covering a variety of topics and all organized (yes, I admit it) using a structure note.
I have let random memories trigger the note writing, which probably explains why the overall process has been, well, random.  Recently, I’ve been thinking I’d like some more discipline and consistency in the process.  You know the saying - be careful what you wish for!

I followed the instructions and verified that my emacs is compiled with tree-sitter flag (I downloaded emacs binary from fedroa repos). I have libtree-sitter and libtree-sitter-devel installed from system package manager. Following is my configuration of tree-sitter
 (use-package treesit :ensure nil :custom (treesit-language-source-alist '((c++ "https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-cpp") (python "https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python") (c "https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c"))) (major-mode-remap-alist '((c++-mode . c++-ts-mode) (python-mode . python-ts-mode) (c-mode . c-ts-mode))) (treesit-font-lock-level 4)) 
 Though I cannot pin point exactly what I did but for some reason while before I simply got a nil for 
 (treesit-language-available-p 'c++) 
 but now I am getting this for some reason 
 *** Eval error *** Wrong type argument: stringp, nil 
 What is even more confusing that c-ts-mode and python-ts-mode are working fine. 
 Here are my contents of ~/.config/emacs/tree-sitter
 . ├── libtree-sitter-c++.so ├── libtree-sitter-c.so └── libtree-sitter-python.so

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past decade, pixel density of displays has increased significantly. On Mac, the "Retina" display concept represents a doubling of display density, from ~100 to ~200ppi. On HDPI Retina displays, applications are presented with and work in "virtual" pixels of 2x2 physical screen pixels, so that font sizes, icons, etc. remain "normal". Then raster, vector and font drawing can make use of all the tiny pixels, for higher quality. My question is, how does Emacs on different systems handle HDPI display?
 My build (emacs-mac) provides some limited support for varying DPI. You can provide parallel high-res versions of image files named like file@2x.ext which are substituted for low-DPI images (without the @2x) automatically. You can similarly embed the text property :data-2x in generated image data. But standalone high density images (like Retina screenshots) must be scaled appropriately (often by 0.5x) to "light all the pixels" and not appear overly large.
 What do other ports do to accommodate high-DPI? Nothing? Do you just select very large font sizes? What if you have multiple displays with significantly different pixel density connected? How is image display handled? This seems like an area where some coherent treatment and documentation would be very helpful. But perhaps the underlying OS/display systems vary so greatly in their treatment of HDPI it limits this kind of progress?

 This is my first Reddit post so please let me know if I’ve done anything wrong. 
 I started with no experience in software developing a few years ago into a Scala environment so Scala is all I know. 
 I would say I am at a middle level point and trying to further my knowledge but I am struggling on making my learning efficient as I seem to go round and round reusing the same solutions. 
 Somebody who started with me went through Rock the JVM and he said it was the best thing he done. I’m thinking of starting that. 
 Has anybody got suggestions or recommendations on how to learn new things more effectively? 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi everyone
 I want org-ellipsis to display the number of subheadings.
 that's because of two reasons.
  
I want to add meaning to the decorations. 
 I want to get some information of big picture even if it's folded.
  
It's something like this: 
 * test (23)
 * testtest (3)
 I think you can understand the big picture of the file faster if you have numbers...
 (I think it's useful to display some information individually, even if not just numbers.)
 ​
 So, I tried to implement this.
 I thought of assigning a unique value to ellipsis for individual lines by assigning a conditional value to org-ellipsis.
 but I couldn't figure out the conditions to identify the ellipsis displayed on individual lines...
 and I read some code related to org-ellipsis, but I couldn't figure out the mechanism to specifically display org-ellipsis.
 (All I found out was that the ellipsis value was stored in something like some archetype when collapsing headings...)
 ​
 if anyone has any hints please let me know !
 Also let me know your thought on the idea of adding information to org-ellipsis. 
 Apologize for my bad English and stupid attempt. thank you for long reading!

Some information about me: I have graduated in computer science and used to work one and a half years as a junior developer. At the moment I'm travelling through different countries, but I would love to also learn something related to development. Because I will continue my traveling and it's more about learning something new (Haskell and functional programming), I'm not looking for a long term position, but more an internship. I'm happy to hear from you guys if you are interested. Greetings Micha😊

When I debug Rust code I don't get syntax highlighting under certain inactive code (specifically when statements like #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] appear). I tried adding a line to my .cargo/config to enable these features features but rust-analyzer doesn't seem to pick it up. I feel like there's a basic option for this, so apologies if I've missed something but I'm rather new to emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I followed the mastering emacs guide to installing tree-sitter but am left a bit confused about what actually these additional major modes are and have some questions.
  
What is the difference between the installing the package tree-sitter and building emacs with tree-sitter? Which one should I use given both options? 
 Do these new ts major modes serve to replace existing modes or do they sit on-top of the regular modes? So If I was using rustic package for rust development, does rust-ts-mode essentially replace the rustic package or would I still need it? 
 How would you tell emacs to use tree-sitter mode if there are no default major modes for the language to begin with? For example rust or go don't have built-in modes like python or bash do so a command like (setq major-mode-remap-alist '((go-mode . go-ts-mode))) would not work unless you explicitly install the go-mode package.

 Or you guys use a pure FP library such as http4s (I guess)? 
 I was thinking that using super mature web frameworks like Springboot + using FP for the service layer makes sense. 
 Hopefully this post doesn't trigger too much the pure FP devs. I'm getting started with FP. I have a Java & Python background. I did some Spark jobs in Scala also.

I want to:
this project, and not another one, or when I'm focused on following a different trail in this project).
I'm curious how you all handle these in your workflow.
Should I drop a zettel with the info in the appropriate place and hope I'll resurface it at the right time? My issue here is that I often don't know what information is going to come out of the article until I've read it.  Should I just take my best guess? (am I just overthinking it)?
Should I keep it on a separate task list or someday/maybe list?  My issue here is that I almost never get to the things on my someday/maybe list because I'm never looking at it when I'm working on a current project, and my task lists quickly get cluttered if they aren't immediately actionable.
Other ideas?  Thanks!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CUDA is a language that, by default is unsupported by treesit in emacs.
 It has a grammar defined in https://github.com/theHamsta/tree-sitter-cuda.
 I have followed https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tree_002dsitter-Major-Modes.html and https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto to come up with the following:
 (use-package treesit-auto :custom (treesit-auto-install t) :config (add-to-list 'treesit-auto-recipe-list (make-treesit-auto-recipe :lang 'cuda :ts-mode 'cuda-ts-mode :url "https://github.com/theHamsta/tree-sitter-cuda" :ext "\\.cu\\'")) (treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist 'all) (global-treesit-auto-mode 1)) (define-derived-mode cuda-ts-mode prog-mode "CUDA[ts]" "Major mode for editing CUDA with tree-sitter." (when (treesit-ready-p 'cuda) (treesit-major-mode-setup))) 
 Unfortunately, I have problems with the code:
  
When I open a .cu file, it is opened in Fundamental mode
 When I manually M-x cuda-ts-mode, it is enabled but I do not get syntax highlighting
 The CUDA parser is not automatically installed; I had to install it via M-x treesit-install-language-grammar and build the recipe interactively because it didn't find my provided recipe
  
What is wrong about the code?
 Thanks and I wish you all a happy new year!
 EDIT: I was able to get syntax highlighting working by calling (treesit-parser-create 'cuda) before (treesit-major-mode-setup) and by deriving from c-mode instead of prog-mode. Is this the correct solution?

It is organized by indentation, so it can be folded or hoisted to only show relevant sections by the two editors I use on it most frequently (vim and taskpaper). I just dump in there anything I think of, and freely re-organize (move up and down, indent, create headers and groups).  I keep tasks in taskpaper syntax, but essential to the model is the fact that anything can go in.

 Haskell is notoriously not very pretty when it comes to tooling and dev-environment.
 What would be, in your opinion, the cleanest way of setting up your toolchain and interacting with it? Consistent, sensible file locations, organized packages, and anything else you can think of.
 We're not going to get Cargo, but we can definitely do better than what I've seen a lot of people doing.
 Attempting to use as few tools as possible that accomplish as much as possible. 
 What is your minimalist, sane environment and tooling?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always had the scrollbars disabled in Emacs because they kind of stand out in an ugly way and they are visible on every window even if not needed (even in the minibuffer window). As the toolkit scrollbars in Emacs are nevertheless handy, I tinkered a bit to solve both problems: * 1: on-demand-scroll-bar-mode is an alternative to scroll-bar-mode that shows vertical scroll bars only when needed https://github.com/florommel/on-demand-scroll-bar * 2: custom-css allows to load arbitrary CSS snippets to style Emacs's GTK widgets. It comes with a dedicated mode to change the scrollbar visuals, as this requires special care. However, you can also adapt all other GTK widgets inside Emacs (menu bar, tool bar, context menus). The package requires a C module to be built and loaded and works only with GTK builds of Emacs. https://github.com/florommel/custom-css
 Both packages are experimental. Of course, they can be used independently from each other.

 My dream is to eventually build my own text editor with very simple features, but for now, I just want to get started using something other than Gedit. Emacs seems right because of the simplicity of setting custom key bindings, and the tables and code output in files.
 I understand that I need a theme.elfile and to place it in a folder. Then, I need to run some code to let Emacs know that the theme is there. However, I can't find the theme.el file, and I don't know which folder to place the theme in or what command I need to run. Help, please.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming out of EmacsConf, I'm converting over to lsp-bridge. Right now I'm doing mostly golang and WASM stuff and so I'm trying to figure out how to effectively use lsp-bridge with gopls. Looking at the lsp-bridge docs, it sure looks like gopls is first-class supported. However, I'm not getting anything lsp-bridge-y when I'm editing go code.
 Anyone care to share their working config snippet(s) for gopls and lsp-bridge? I would share mine except its such a moving target right now while I'm trying to get things working that I'm not sure it would produce productive feedback and probably just confuse folks who read the post a year from now.
 I'll make everyone a deal, I'll post my config once it's resolved however I will warn I'm a literate config person so it'd not only be elisp but also some other tooling for making sure all of the Python dependencies etc are installed. I guess folks would be free to copy/paste/modify as they see fit for their setup.
 Thx!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently using eglot for LSP and markdown-mode to render markdown in eldoc buffer.
 When I click on a link in an eldoc buffer for a rust project, it stops, flashes and then prints progn: Beginning of buffer in the *Message*.
 So, I figured maybe if I turn on toggle-debug-on-error I can find out where the error is happening. But, clicking the link does not trigger the error for debugging.
 So, I decided to put a message call at the beginning and end of the markdown-follow-thing-at-point (which is executed when you click on a link) like this:
 elisp (defun markdown-follow-thing-at-point (arg) "Follow thing at point if possible, such as a reference link or wiki link. Opens inline and reference links in a browser. Opens wiki links to other files in the current window, or the another window if ARG is non-nil. See `markdown-follow-link-at-point' and `markdown-follow-wiki-link-at-point'." (interactive "P") (message "markdown-follow-thing-at-point sos") (cond ((markdown-link-p) (markdown-follow-link-at-point)) ((markdown-wiki-link-p) (markdown-follow-wiki-link-at-point arg)) (t (let* ((values (markdown-link-at-pos (point))) (url (nth 3 values))) (unless url (user-error "Nothing to follow at point")) (markdown--browse-url url)))) (message "markdown-follow-thing-at-point sis")) 
 When I evaluate the defun and then click on the link again, it only prints the "markdown-follow-thing-at-point sos" which might imply that the function broke at some point, but I can't see why with toggle-debug-on-error.
 I ideally would like it if it at least open the url in a web browser :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Haskell community,
 I'm currently working on a Haskell project and have come across a challenge I hope you can help with. I've written several instances of functors in my source code, and I'm looking for an efficient way to ensure they comply with the Functor laws.
 Up until now, I've manually written tests for this purpose. You can see an example in my GitHub repository here: HaskellRank Functor Tests.
 Additionally, here's how I've been running these tests:
 (base) dewi@DewiJones:~/code/hask_tacer/hask-tracer2$ stack test --test-arguments='--match "/HaskellRank.HaskellRankJson/"' hask-tracer2> test (suite: spec, args: --match /HaskellRank.HaskellRankJson/) HaskellRank.HaskellRankJson Your Test Suite should pass the Functor Identity Law [✔] +++ OK, passed 100 tests. should pass the Functor Composition Law [✔] +++ OK, passed 100 tests. Finished in 0.0084 seconds 2 examples, 0 failures hask-tracer2> Test suite spec passed 
 While this approach works, it's quite manual and time-consuming. I'm wondering if there's a tool or a feature in GHC/Stack that can automatically scan all functor instances in my source code and check if they adhere to the Functor laws. Any suggestions or advice on how to streamline this process would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance!

 Linking to C code works fine, but with C++ I get a bunch of "undefined symbol ..." spit out by ld.lld.exe during cabal build. Using dumpbin.exe I can see the symbols are present in the lib I'm trying to link to. So I assume this is C++ ABI incompatibility MSYS2 and VC++.
 Can I somehow configure my build to use the VC++ ABI when building my Haskell code?

 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library for refined types in Scala. You can attach predicates (also called "refinements") to type and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive = 5 val y: Int :| Positive = -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] = -5.refineEither //Left("...") 
 Check the README for further information.
 Main changes
 Doobie & Skunk support
 You can use Iron types in your query and tables. Here is an example using iron-doobie:
 ```scala import doobie.* import doobie.implicits.*
 import io.github.iltotore.iron.* import io.github.iltotore.iron.constraint.all.* import io.github.iltotore.iron.doobie.given

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wolfram Mathematica can apparently function as an lsp server now https://github.com/WolframResearch/LSPServer and the official notebook editor gives the user a dexterity of code manipulation on par with notepad, so I put 2 and 2 together and attempted to make emacs use the lsp server with mixed results.
 I simply took the command to start the lsp server from the wolfram plugin of vscode and added it to eglot like
 (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '('xah-wolfram-mode "/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/13.3/Executables/WolframKernel" "`kernel`" "-noinit" "-noprompt" "-nopaclet" "-noicon" "nostartuppaclets" "-run" "Needs[\"LSPServer`\"];LSPServer`StartServer[]")) 
 With this, the eldoc and the flymake integration part of eglot works, but I'm not getting most of the rest of the functionality, in particular 'completion-at-point'.
 I also tried adding the same lsp server command to lsp-mode instead of eglot, but that just didn't work at all.
 (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(xah-wolfram-mode . "wolfram")) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection '("/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/13.3/Executables/WolframKernel" " `kernel` "" -noinit" "-noprompt " "-nopaclet" "-noicon" "-nostartuppaclets" "-run Needs[\"LSPServer`\"];LSPServer`StartServer[]")) :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on "wolfram") :server-id 'wolfram) 
 Does someone have any idea how to troubleshoot this? I'm really more interested in the eglot route because that is what I use otherwise. I do completion with corfu and it works in the languages that eglot supports by default. The problem is that I'm not really getting any error messages even with everything in 'eglot-strict-mode' turned on, so I have no idea what else to try.

 First, a little backstory.
 I have started getting interested in note-taking and knowledge bases about a year and a half ago. I first stumbled upon Notion, but quickly abandoned it due to its online-only nature. Then I started looking at alternatives like Obsidian and Logseq. Logseq caught my attention since it provided some nice features like daily journaling and "Everything is a node" strategy. I liked it. Then I learned that it was a watered down version of Emacs's org-mode. That is when I started looking into Emacs. This was a year ago.
 I fell in love instantly. It was mind boggling to me that you could change anything and nothing was off limits. This was a year ago and I still change things on a daily basis. I think I may have fallen into the rabbit hole of endless customiza…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there!
 It's been a while since I've wanted to share my personal Emacs configuration. Either because I managed to configure something and someone needed help (like typescript on a React environment) or I needed help doing something and I was "afraid" of sharing it.
 Unfortunately my dotfile (yes, it was a ~/.emacs file) was ugly, old, slow and full of personal stuff.
 I managed to make it faster (0.6 seconds loadtime with ~95 packages on Linux), somewhat organized and (I hope) free of personal stuff.
 This config focuses on having the SAME (or close) user experience on both TUI and GUI. 
 Nowadays you can do things on tmux, for example, and you want to use Emacs as a sole editor with `emacs -nw` (the same fashion Neovim users do), others times you may want Emacs also as your terminal emulator and project organizer, you may want to start several instances of Emacs for gnus, ERC or other stuff, on either TUI or GUI. This config aims this situations, so nothing should be missing from GUI to TUI. You can even start it as a daemon and use at the same time on terminal and GUI without breaking anything.
 On this screenshot we have TUI (left) and GUI (right):

 It is made in a single file, using as much of default Emacs as possible, so you can fork it, customize or get inspired. It is not, by any means an "Emacs Distro".
 I'd love some nice feedbacks (preferably on Github issues so we can track and reuse issues).

Swimming with Ideas
This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Please be courageous and add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
Tags can either be used to categorize notes or give an idea of the note's theme. My subatomic is a short summary or theme that replaces a theming tag. Tagging is unnecessary overhead.  Tag for note status and grouping only. Let structure notes and linking dominate.
Web Historical Trails breadcrumbs, GPS adventure breadcrumbs, and how the metaphor can be applied to how I explore my journey with life.
Focusing attention is a skill much like wood carving. Focusing takes time to develop. It can be learned. There are better and worse ways to practice. A mentor boosts progress. This habit is susceptible to the usual biases—especially the Dunning-Kruger Effect.
Things I'm reading:
Calvino, Italo. The path to the spiders' nests. 1947.
Garmus, Bonnie. Lessons in chemistry. 2022.
Parrish, Shane. Clear thinking: turning ordinary moments into extraordinary results. 2023.
Voltaire. Candide. 1759.
Music I'm listening to:

The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, everyone! I'm so glad to have discovered this forum.
A question has been nagging me ever since I started my ZK journey, and that is: what do I do if I'm into multiple topics?
My interests are all over the place: I'm into photography, sociology, history, theology, philosophy, linguistics, and education.
I am not sure whether I should have one giant slip box for everything or multiple ones for topics that have stuff in common. But that would also raise a conundrum. I'm into photography, and I'm into art history, so those two topics could be in one slip box. But then I'm also into history in general, so should art history be a part of the box with history or photography? Again, this is just an example, not an actual dilemma.
I'm going through Ahrens' book but I don't know if it will touch on this particular topic. He does mention that Luhmann wrote on all sorts of subjects, which seems to indiciate he had a single slip box system for everything.
Has anyone here dealt with this?]]></summary>

 ​
 TL;DR I didn't like how Cassava/Aeson forced me to proliferate newtype wrappers for different kinds of date formats. The recipe pattern is about allowing me to specify different date parsing formats for each record type without newtype wrappers and keep generic derivation of record parsers.

 All the displayed icons are the same \"save\" icon. Note the wrong icon next to \"test.el\" file name. The icon only shows correctly in the lower scratch buffer.
 When invoking C-u C-x = I see this:
  position: 4 of 7 (43%), column: 3 character:  (displayed as ) (codepoint 57697, #o160541, #xe161) charset: unicode-bmp (Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (U+0000..U+FFFF)) code point in charset: 0xE161 syntax: w which means: word category: L:Strong L2R, j:Japanese to input: type "C-x 8 RET e161" buffer code: #xEE #x85 #xA1 file code: #xEE #x85 #xA1 (encoded by coding system utf-8-unix) display: by this font (glyph code): mac-ct:-*-Hannotate TC-regular-normal-normal-*-13-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#x8AA8) 
 It looks like it uses "Hannotate" as a font, which seems incorrect. However I am not sure how to change this.
 What I have tried or looked at:
  
I have both all-the-icons and nerd-icons fonts installed with their respective commands. I also don't think this is the issue as I can see the correct icon in the scratch buffer.
 I have tried the solutions suggested in this reddit thread. However, it doesn't work for me. I also tried to do (set-fontset-font t 'unicode (font-spec :family "all-the-icons") nil) (i.e. without 'append), and whilst this works for the mode-line it messes up my icons in other places (e.g. dired buffers) as well. 
 Related to the thread above, I also don't have any set-fontset-font in my config, nor any mention of unicode. So I don't think I am changing any fonts in my config in this regard.
 
 I have looked at other similar reddit threads as well, and despite there being many on this topic there hasn't been a solution that has worked so far.
 For whatever reason, the same config works on my other laptop which is also a Macbook with the same Emacs installation.
  
If it matters, I am on MacOS using emacs-plus (29.1).
 Any help is appreciated!

 it "gets the chapter name" $ do Chapter.name chapter `shouldBe` "Protection of Children from Abuse and Neglect"

 Here it is in two places, taking advantage of scoping:

 Hi, for the life of me I can't figure how to use Memotrie or any other method to memoize, say, an HTML parsing function. I want to memoize it so I can write a bunch of Hspecs without re-parsing the HTML for each spec.
 IOW, I need a memoized test fixture. There used to be something on the Hspec site but it was removed.
  
Somehow I accidentally deleted the rest of my post. The important stuff is up there. :-P

 I've downloaded Doom Emacs and configured so it would have support for JavaScript, Python, Rust, and Web, but when I run the command doom doctor it tells me:
  > :lang python ! Couldn't find black. Code formatting will not work. ! Couldn't find pyflakes. Import management will not work. ! Couldn't find isort. Import sorting will not work. ! Couldn't find pipenv. pipenv support will not work. ! Couldn't find nosetests. Running tests through nose will not work. ! Couldn't find pytest. Running tests through pytest will not work. > :lang web ! Couldn't find tidy. Code formatting in HTML modes will not work. ! Couldn't find stylelint. Linting for CSS modes will not work. There are 8 warnings! 
 This are things that I have in my system, for example: 
 kelisei@Debian:~/.emacs.d$ pip list | grep black black 23.12.1 kelisei@Debian:~/.emacs.d$ npm -v tidy 9.2.0 
 I've tried searching but no one seems to have this particular error, some info that would be relevant:
  
Python version: 3.12.1
 Distro: Debian 12 
 NPM version: 9.2.0
 I've installed it from the package manager: emacs-gtk/stable,now 1:28.2+1-15 amd64 [installed]
 Thank you!

 Special thanks to u/eli-zaretskii for guiding me through this problem. Original post is here 
 First it's important to note that as of today <29-12-2023>, on Emacs 29.1, it is NOT possible to have a colored emojis in Emacs. However it is possible to have black-and-white emojis, so here is a guide. 
 First make sure you have the right version. Open Emacs and check the version with: M-x version RET

 Elisp doesn’t use namespaces or private variables. This means you’re basically living in the Wild West. The only thing that prevents constant name collisions is that people are responsible about naming everything with appropriate prefixes.
 EDIT: The specific use-case I'm considering is color-coding tabs for buffers. I know there are a couple packages that support tabs for buffers, and I'm currently using centaur-tabs. However, centaur-tabs has no color-coding options. I anticipate it will take a decent amount of work (and a better understanding of emacs/elisp than I have now) to achieve the color-coding that I want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I know there have been a few posts on eglot setup lately, but had trouble making things work as they should using all the advice there.
 Briefly, I was able to make eglot work for built-in package such as `os` or `sys` (though not consistently), but was never able to make completions work for installed packages (such as numpy or pandas). 
 I strongly suspect that the lsp server is not using the right Python version (I tried all servers, pyls, jedi, etc.). How can I coerce eglot and the underlying server to use the right Python version, and to load the right PYTHONPATHs? 
 In general, I use pyenv, and I use 
 (setq python-shell-interpreter "/Users/$USER/.pyenv/shims/ipython" 
 python-shell-interpreter-args "-i --simple-prompt")
 ​
 Thanks for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, happy end of the year.
 I'm wondering why I keep coming back to custom code snippets on StackOverflow whenever I need to colorise a buffer that has ANSI colours in it. Here's a sample from a Rails app:
  Parameters: {"id"=>"27"} [1m[36mUser Load (1.0ms)[0m [1m[34mSELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = $1 ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT $2[0m [["id", 2], ["LIMIT", 1]] ↳ app/controllers/application_controller.rb:27:in `set_establishment' [1m[36mEstablishment Load (0.7ms)[0m [1m[34mSELECT "establishments".* FROM "establishments" WHERE "establishments"."id" = $1 LIMIT $2[0m [["id", 2], ["LIMIT", 1]] 
 Are ANSI escape sequences trickier than they seem? I'm going to resort to a custom bit of code (thank you people of StackOverflow) but I was wondering why log-view-mode or compilation-mode don't have it built-in?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the documentary Kevin Hart & Chris Rock: Headliners Only (Netflix, 2023) while preparing for a portion of their tour, Kevin Hart admires a portion of Chris Rock's stand up comedy method and calls it "a science". Chris Rock writes headlines for his jokes on slips of paper and then arranges them on either tables or small bulletin boards to outline his set list for presenting jokes for his performances.


If there are interesting contemporaneous news items which appear, he'll include a newspaper or other material to represent the related joke for inclusion into his set. This makes a fascinating means of outlining his material and seems to fall within the realm of my search for zettelkasten output processes. Even if Rock doesn't use index cards to write or store his jokes like comedians in the past have, he's using a slip-based method for outlining and arranging them as part of his output process.

Kevin Hart: Chris, I'm so... I'm so, uh blown away by what I'm discovering that is your process.
Chris Rock: My process.
Kevin Hart: This all your shit?


Chris Rock: Well, this here would be, uh, bullet points for tonight. Every card represents a joke or a reference that I choose. I don't wanna forget. You know what I mean? Like, you can remember all your jokes, but some nights, I'm like, 'ehhh, I'm not gonna close with this one. I'm gonna close with that one'.
Kevin Hart: You have it down to a science where you can bullet point the time.
Chris Rock: You can. And by the way, sometimes, something happens in the news.
Kevin Hart: You got jokes on the bench.
Chris Rock: I have jokes on the bench.

Kevin Hart: I'm going to tell you I'm not only impressed by that, but I'm disappointed in myself. Because, uh, whatever I got, got to to fly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm talking about row level multi tenancy, where each row in your relational database has a tenant_id column. You could solve this by using different schemas or database or whatever else but we have Haskell at our disposal, so let's focus (but not constrain) the discussion on that.
 The goals are:
  
Make it very hard (but maybe not impossible) for tenants to access each other's data
 End up with a convenient interface
 Use an already established DB library
  
I've worked on a few projects with such multi tenancy and have never really been "satisfied" with how we've done this.
 Project 1 used template Haskell to generate "repository" code that had the filtering built-in. We were lucky enough that for our usecase this was fine. TH was not very pleasant to use and the approach is rather limiting.
 Project 2 was simply relying on the developers to not forget to add the appropriate filter.
 Project 3 uses a custom database library that has quite a lot of type level wizardry but it basically boils down to attaching the tenant id filter at the end of each query. The downside is that we basically need to reimplement everything that already exists in established DB libraries from scratch. Joins are a pain so we resort to SQL views for more complicated queries.
 Is there an established way people go about this? Maybe some DB libraries already can handle it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on the graph problems from the famous Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems. Most of the problems involve searching/traversal of the graph, and I'm pretty confused about how to approach the solutions idiomatically. I'm looking for some help in evaluating one the following options:
  
Basic recursion: Pass the state around during recursive calls, and use if-then-else to prune/terminate as necessary. This is the simplest choice, but results in similar-looking boilerplate code. 
 Same as above but using the State monad.
 Model a search problem as a tuple of (start value, expanding frontier function, terminating condition), and provide implementations of the 2nd and 3rd items for each algorithm. This model is shown here and looks promising in reducing boilerplate.
 Read a novel academic paper, like Structuring Depth-First Search Algorithms in Haskell or Backtracking, Interleaving, and Terminating Monad Transformers and come up with an implementation. FWIW, it seems like the Data.Graph library implementation is based on the former paper (but for the purposes of the exercise I shouldn't use).
 Logic and Continuation: This option is mentioned in passing in some places but there is exactly zero online literature available as far as any practical examples go. None whatsoever. I don't even know why would I choose this option, other than it potentially reducing boilerplate. The H-99 problems aren't for infinite graphs, and ask for all answers, not the first one, so, fairness/interleaving isn't really a concern.
  
A somewhat related question had been asked before, although it focussed on a specific advent of code problem and lacked the research I've laid out above. Nothing against the question, just saying that the comments there don't preempt my question.
 What would be the most elegant option? If there's one that's not listed above, please do tell.

 When exporting with LaTeX pdf I get: "zsh:1: command not found: pdflatex" in my Org PDF LaTeX Output buffer. LaTeX is installed on my machine and the export works fine from terminal emacs (emacs -nw) so from what I've read this is likely a PATH issue. However, the whole setting a PATH so that emacs can see where LaTeX is is over my head with my current knowledge as I have little experience in terminal. 
 Is anyone able to explain how to go about letting emacs see where LaTeX is installed? Or maybe insight into a solution if this isn't the issue?
 I know where pdflatex is by running "which pdflatex" in terminal but do not know next steps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are in the company of friends.
The time between the solstice and the new year is a time for introspection, reflection, and gratitude. It's a time to look back on the year that has passed and think about what we have learned and achieved. And more importantly, it's a time to look forward to the new year and set intentions for ourselves.
I am grateful for the inspiration I receive from your posts and comments and for seeing what you are studying. We can brainstorm, debate, and explore new ideas together. By doing so, we can push the boundaries of our thinking and gain a deeper understanding of the world around us.
A forum post can be the starting point for a stream of ideas.
Thank you, everyone. (Including, you transient lurkers.)]]></summary>

 Package usability, and any problems you might find.

 Lets say I have this emacs lisp snippet:
 (defcustom my-file-custom-variable "/home/user/my-file.txt" "Path to my file." :type 'file) 
 Emacs manual(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Simple-Types.html) mentions this about the file widget type:
  
The value must be a file name. The widget provides completion.
  
But I cannot get my emacs to perform autocompletion on file path. Is there something wrong with my elisp snippet? is there any key binding to trigger autocompletion? Is there some additional setup required for autocompletion in customize buffer? Or do I simply misunderstand the emacs manual?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've been using org-roam for a while now, but I recently started to go a bit deeper with customization and wanted your opinion on my current workflow and possible ways to automate and improve it.
 Basically, I'm trying to use org-roam as an issue tracker with issue, task and time management, similarly to tools like redmine.
 Currently my workflow is as follows:
  
I have an issues.org file containing all issues and their state (TODO, STRT, etc.)
 Every time a new issue comes in, I add it to that file and assign an id with `org-id-get-create`
 For that new issue, I also create a new org file specific to that issue to track description, comments, etc. and roam-link the original TODO item to it
 I use org-roam-dailies to then reference the TODO item from issues.org, clock spent time and add tasks as sub items.
  
This is working mostly fine for me, I'm able to build precise monthly reports over the issues I've been working on, however, there's a bit of a "disconnection" between dailies and the overall issues file.
 As the issue state is only recorded in issues.org, the agenda never shows the actual state of the issue when I clock-in, as that's only a roam-link to the original issue. Conversely, time tracking only happens at the daily-level and it's never reflected back to the original issue. Also, having tasks as sub-items in the dailies makes it easy to track all tasks by searching for roam back references, but at the same time it creates a lot of duplication because sub tasks are not carried over to the next day for example.
 Here I'm asking for your opinion, because I'm not sure if I'm just using org and roam the "wrong way" and I'm not supposed to try to achieve any of this, or if it's a somewhat valid approach and I just need to automate it.
 Thank you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am reading the book "Algorithm Design with Haskell" and have some questions relating to greedy algorithms.
 The book introduces a nondeterministic "greedy condition" as follows:
  gstep x (MinWith cost cs) ← MinWith cost (map (gstep x) cs) 
 gstep x refers to a "greedy step" that optimally extends a candidate by the component x.
 In page 162, it asserts that this condition holds if we can prove the following monotonicity condition
  cost c ≤ cost c' ⇒ cost (gstep x c) ≤ cost (gstep x c') 
 for all c and c' (where c' comes after c in the list of candidates cs)
 In page 181, it says that the greedy condition is satisfied if the monotonicity condition holds for all c and c' (regardless of their positions in the list, I assume).
 My questions are
  
Which version is correct?
 If the first one is correct, then for cost c = cost c', does cost (gstep x c) < cost (gstep x c') violate the monotonicity condition?
 If the second one is correct, then for cost c = cost c', does cost (gstep x c) have to equal cost (gstep x c')?
  
Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use tabspaces + project.el so each tab in the tab bar represents its own project. Like this:
 https://preview.redd.it/pxku3u4x3p8c1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bc23614698024dd7232b689707c1eb48fc067ec
 I've only made some trivial customisations but not sure where to go to make it a little bit more helpful. This is basically it.
 (setq tab-bar-close-button-show nil) (setq tab-bar-tab-hints t) 
 Every example I've seen so far seems to be specific to a config framework like Doom or Nano. No complaints there but would be keen to see some other unique examples in the wild.
 What have you got, if you use tabs? Since we're in emacs I figured they could do a lot more than this, as with the modeline and minibuffer.

I have tried to (setq w32-alt-is-meta nil), but this does not seem to work. For example, setting (global-set-key (kbd "A-x") #'execute-extended-command) does not let me use Alt+x to execute a command. Instead, A-x is mapped to insert-char, and it actually inserts a multiplication sign! I get similar output for Alt+ other characters on windows. Is there a way to get Emacs on Windows to read "A-x" as "A-x"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to define a function - calcLayer - that performs matrix-vector multiplication and adds biases to the resulting product.
 module Neural where import Linear data DenseLayer = DenseLayer {weights :: Linear.Matrix Float, biases :: Linear.Vector Float} calcLayer :: Num dataType => Linear.Vector dataType -> DenseLayer -> Linear.Vector dataType calcLayer ingress layer = Linear.vecSum (Linear.matVecMul (weights layer) ingress) (biases layer) 
 ​
 This will not compile. When I remove the function's "Num" type constraint everything builds just fine:
 module Neural where import Linear data DenseLayer = DenseLayer {weights :: Linear.Matrix Float, biases :: Linear.Vector Float} calcLayer :: Linear.Vector Float -> DenseLayer -> Linear.Vector Float calcLayer ingress layer = Linear.vecSum (Linear.matVecMul (weights layer) ingress) (biases layer) 
 ​
 I'm not exactly sure how to justify to myself why this worked as a solution. In my head, the previous version said that "datatype" is restricted to the "Num" typeclass. Doesn't "Float" fall under that umbrella?
 ​
 I'm trying to keep everything as general as possible, so preferably I would even like my DenseLayer definition to be able to accept other types belonging to the Num typeclass (not just Float), but I'm not sure if there is a way to do that with record syntax.
 ​
 Beyond shedding some light on why this worked, any criticism or advice will also be greatly appreciated.

 I'm a digital ASIC/IC designer using SystemVerilog/Verilog to design digital logic HW. I got started learning Clash to model digital logic hardware since this week since I wanna feel the power of functional programming in hardware design. However, I don't have any functional programming background and thus I jumped start from modeling shift-registers with length N in Clash by the assistant of ChatGPT. It goes well but I cannot feel the power of functional programming in the context of digital hardware to be honest. Thus, I'm here to hear from your suggestion. What minimum design case example can show the value of Clash against VHDL/Verilog? Or what's the realistic benefits of Clash against traditional RTL HW description language? Thank you

 ​
 Still new to the Emacs space and slowly making my way through the emacs mastering book :)
 ​
 I was wondering on a few things.
 1: How do people avoid hurting their fingers using the default emacs keybindings, i.e. using control and meta keys so frequently.
 a. I understand people use vim keybindings to avoid this
 b. But want to know if people just bare it/its not as bad as its made out to be (i.e. classic emacs pinky)
 2: What keyboard do you use and does it help avoid finger contortions with the control and meta key.
 a. Sorta wondering how the custom keyboard space merges with the emacs space, i.e. is the miryoku layout with homerow mods helpful etc.
  
For those who use intellij, how has emacs influenced your workflow. I see there's IdeaVim and IntelliMacs alongside the Emacs intellij keybindings, how have you setup IntelliJ in light of your emacs usage
  
Thanks for your time!

 emacs 29.1 has eglot baked in, and M-x eglot asked for access to an executable provided by python (pylsp)
  
pip install "python-lsp-server[all]" into a dummy venv
 Add the venv's bin/ to $PATH
 And M-x eglot connects to the language server!
  
eglot now finds indent errors, syntax errors, highlights all instances of variables, and gives guidance on functions like print (although is in the minibuffer and not well formatted for my eyes)
 But it does not give command or variable completion which I think is supposed to come from jedi.
 My question is - how to get eglot to speak to jedi? 
 Is completion supposed to come from 
  
pylsp (in the python venv) speaking with python jedi,
 through eglot speaking directly to jedi (in the python venv) or
 directly between emacs buffer hook and emacs jedi (which I cant find in the package-list)
  
Tried with emacs 28 - but eglot wasn't in the package-list
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I somehow didn't managed to insert the picture in the post, so here it is as a link to imgur.
 As you can see in the picture, I've succeeded to get Icon rendering in Dired on Windows 10, however emojis do not work at all.
 Seems weird that I'm able to render icons and not emojis. I understand they are different, but I'm not getting why the one is able to be displayed and the other is not.
 I've read every article I could find on this sub and google about Emojis in Emacs on Windows, but most articles are either 2+ year old, or have some broken links and succeeded to fix this issue.
 I'm running native Emacs on Windows, I'm not using WSL. I'm using Emacs 28.2.
 I have installed all-the-icons. I also have installed "Noto Color Emoji" and put this in my ~/.emacs:
 (set-fontset-font t 'symbol "Noto Color Emoji")
 And evaluated. I've also tried with "native" windows emoji font: Segoe UI Emoji, but same story.
 I'm getting the emoji in the buffer, but it's invisible. If I copy it from, say, emojipedia and CTRL + y in a buffer, the cursor moves as if something was inserted, but nothing is shown as if I inserted a SPC.
 However if I CTRL+a CTRL+k and then paste it in, say, my browser, I get all the emojis I've inserted in the buffer.
 My question is - Has the Windows API changed(that is the reason, allegedly, why it didn't work in the past as I've read about this issue on this sub) or is there some other way to display emojis in Emacs buffer on Windows 10 that bypasses this API problem or whichever other problem there is.
 On my Linux machine everything works fine, however, unfortunately, sometimes I'm forced to use Windows and thus want to make it work here as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently using org-roam, org-roam-bibtex, citar, and citar-org-roam and embark. When I have a citation link in my org file, I click on it and it opens embark showing all the actions I can take. Since it is a new note, I click on citar-open-notes, which automatically extracts the title and author and populates it into my capture template:
  (org-roam-capture-templates '(("n" "literature note" plain "%?" :target (file+head "${slug}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n#+filetags: :paper:\n#+author: ${author}\n#+created: %U\n#+STARTUP: latexpreview\n") :unnarrowed t))) 
 Now, my bibtex file contains information about the paper's year, and journal and I was hoping to extract it automatically just like it does with the ${title} and ${author}, but it does not appear to be the case. So I was wondering how this can be achieved such that citar automatically extracts the other pieces of info in the citation. I tried searching the citar-org-roam github, but I was not able to find something like this in the documentation. So currently, I am just using the following:
 (use-package citar-org-roam :straight t :after (citar org-roam) :config (citar-org-roam-mode) ) ;; You can also use citar-org-roam to plugin to org-roam-bibtex, like so: (citar-register-notes-source 'orb-citar-source (list :name "Org-Roam Notes" :category 'org-roam-node :items #'citar-org-roam--get-candidates :hasitems #'citar-org-roam-has-notes :open #'citar-org-roam-open-note :create #'orb-citar-edit-note :annotate #'citar-org-roam--annotate)) (setq citar-notes-source 'orb-citar-source)

What I am imagining is there being a thing like #+include: to import any code I want to use from there to my org file, without actually exporting the contents of the first file. So, for example, if I have a file one.org with the contents...
 #+name: test #+begin_src python x = "Hello World" #+end_src 
 I would like to be able to use this in another file two.org in a way like...
 #+include-but-dont-export: pathto/one.org #+begin_src python :include test print(x) #+end_src #+results: : Hello World 
 Is there anything like this, currently? Thanks.

 However, I recently have to be checking now an Exchange work mail, and the reason I was using GNUS in the first place is not to have external dependencies like with mbsync... Is there any configuration that I can do to still get this mail?, or am I doomed to go to another app or use davmail?,

 Likewise, I'm currently running a high-bandwidth Haskell application on http-client, but the program keeps on crashing (without exceptions).
 I think we've been generally aware that Haskell networking has been a bit retrograde for quite some time, but it'd be nice if someone (else, not me) would help step up to get Haskell's networking libs back on track.

 This blog entry doesn't really convince me why I should prefer type families over Fundeps, especially since functional dependencies seem more elegant to me instead of introducing additional types or even another extensions like "type family dependencies".
 Here is a "radical suggestion" that fits this topic well:
 https://typesandkinds.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/what-are-type-families/
 Accordingly, functional dependencies seems less problematic…

 I am, for some reason, writing a screen play, and taught it will be helpful to distinct different elements of scripts by applying different background colour to blocks.

 I think maybe it should be like this, but I don't know what to put instead of "org-src-block-faces".

 I'm using Doom Emacs, and according to this, if I have something tagged :important: And something else tagged :important:chore:
 I should be able to do a tag search like important-chore or +important&-chore to be more explicit. But the negation doesn't seem to work at all when I do the search, it works the opposite. If I do +important&-chore it ONLY shows me things marked :important:chore: 
 I would think that it's completely broken, but it IS searching the org files correctly and finding tags. 
 Match tag search
 Search for important
 Try to negate chore

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My work involves a fair amount of time spent in the terminal, in docker containers, on remote machines via ssh, and sometimes in containers on remote machines. To support this, I’ve developed a customized terminal experience on kitty. Basically, if I open a new tab, it will clone my current environment, including the container/remote, current directory, and current bashrc. And it also color-codes tabs based on the type of environment I’m in. 
 I’m curious if it would be possible/interesting/desirable to recreate this setup in emacs, with the ultimate goal of using emacs as a customized ide + terminal emulator. 
 Does anyone have thoughts on this? The first issue that I see is that so far, I haven’t found a tab bar for emacs that supports customizing the colors of the tabs. I’m sure this is possible, but I’m too new to emacs to know how difficult it would be (I have experience coding in multiple lisp dialects, so needing to code in order to customize is not a drawback). Thanks.
 (EDIT: I guess this is partly a question about customizing emacs and partly a question about using emacs as my primary terminal emulator.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two days ago I wrote a small experiment that lets me include Lisp as a template placeholders. It looks something like this:
 1 + 2 = {{ 3 }} 1 + 2 = {{ (+ 1 2) }} 1 + 2 = {{! escaped }} 
 I used Mustache-like syntax, to basically just delimit Lisp region from the rest of the text. However, due to Lisp paranthesized syntax it is possible to simplify it. I have now re-written it so it just needs one marker to mark which expression is to be evaluated as Lisp:
 1 + 2 = %%3 1 + 2 = %%(+ 1 2) 1 + 2 = %%!escaped 
 Due to Emacs being a text processing toolkit and a Lisp repl/environment, that basically let us use Emacs Lisp as a template language in text files. The intended use is file and code generators.
 The simplified syntax turnes out to be slightly harder to process than the one with start and end delimiters, however I think it might be worth, so here is an experiment to test the idea.
 Download and details about the usage details are in online repo.
 I appreciate critique and discussion, especially if you find a bug or some fundamental problem.

 Do some themes have a way of adjust the cursor colors to match at runtime or there none whatsoever?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I also posted on Posit's community portal but maybe better to ask the Org-mode crowd.
 I'm interested in exporting Org-mode documents to Quarto. For instance, I have the following document called test-export.org
 #+title: Quarto export test #+begin_src python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #+end_src #+begin_src python plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) #+end_src #+begin_src python :eval no print("Hello World!") #+end_src 
 I first try using pandoc to just export to markdown format:
 pandoc test-export.org -t markdown --o test-export.qmd 
 test-export.qmd then looks like
 ``` python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` ``` python plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) ``` ``` {.python eval="no"} print("Hello World!") ``` 
 The problem is that Quarto expects 
 ```{python} 
 to denote Python code blocks. (I can understand that pandoc makdown conversion should not know to convert :eval no to #| eval: false in the code block but that is secondary).
 I could write a post-text-processing script to handle this but I wonder if there is a more direct way to at least get the language specification to be {python} instead of python or {.python ...}. I have also tried exporting to other Markdown flavors using pandoc, and using Org-mode's built-in Markdown exporter. I guess the built-in exporter targets the original Markdown
 # Table of Contents import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) print("Hello World!") 
 so is even further away from the Quarto form.
 AFAIK the Quarto documentation only defines the Quarto -> Org transformation and not the other way around. 
 Thanks for your suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I wrote org-roam-pygraph, a small Python library to extract the natural graph structure associated to a collection of org-roam nodes.
 Recently I took up a project of running some data analysis on my org-roam collection. In the process, I decided to write a more featureful Python library to assist in all the grunt work of extracting information from the org-roam database.
 Features
  
Several "indices" are provided, which are dictionaries with roam-node IDs as keys and some data pertaining to that node as values. Indices provided are 
 Title index (data: title of node)
 Filename index (data: where the node is located)
 Tags index (data: tags the node has)
 Backlink index (data: list of roam-node IDs a node links to)
 Org link index (data: list of org links that are not backlinks to other nodes)
 Node body index (data: the body text of the node)
 Math snippets index (data: list of LaTeX snippets in the body of a node)
 Source block index (data: list of src blocks in body text, tagged by language)
 
 networkx representation of your org-roam collection. You can use networkx to do all kinds of graph analytics on your collection, including visualization, which is how I made the cover image for the git repo.
 Basic manipulations of the collection 
 Filter collection by tags
 Remove orphan nodes
 
  
The code can be found at https://github.com/aatmunbaxi/orgroamtools, and the code is documented at https://aatmunbaxi.github.io/orgroamtools. The package is available on PyPI, and can be installed with pip install orgroamtools.
 PRs and issue reports are welcome.

 If you have a plain list with checkboxes, like

 Is there a way to check all sub items at once, not C-c C-c them all one by one?
 C-c C-c on Things to dojust gives error message
 org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c: Cannot toggle this checkbox: unchecked subitems
 I looked up the manual page for Checkboxes, and one way seems to mark all the items you like to check and C-c C-c, but wondering if there is an easier way for a checkbox subtree?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this has been asked about before, but I haven't been able to turn up any search results about this occurring... For some reason any time I <tab> complete imports in typescript files, company-mode (I assume) is appending a $1 to the end of the name. For example, if I were to type import {Rec and then press <tab> to complete I would expect the result to be import { Recipe } from './recipes/recipe.model where Recipe is the name of the class. Instead my tab-completion is imported as import { Recipe$1 } from './recipes/recipe.model'; 
 This additional $1 only occurs when importing packages- not when using tab completions for anything else. Happy to provide any pieces of my init file that would be of use to help me solve this!

 I am searching for ways to speed up gnus by other tools. By googling, I find that the combination of offlineimap and dovecot can make fetching gmail or other mail fast, and the leafnode can make fetching nntp mail fast.
 I want to read mail list provided by nntp and gmail. It seems that both the way by offlineimap and dovecot and the way by leafnoe are needed. Is that correct? Or the combination of offlineimap and dovecot can also help fetch nntp mail.
 It would be great if anyone can help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Emacs speedrun videos, I have a lot of org docs stacked up that needs recording.
 However, especially with subjective choices with lots of valid options, community breadth is more valuable that individual depth.
 What are habits, tools, configuration choices, fundamental and advanced, that you would recommend to a programmer to ramp up quickly, all the way to becoming productive at working on Elisp packages?
 Videos are around 5-10min and count on the viewer to do the work but try to let them know when to go deep and what on.
 I'll go first: * Intrinsic types in Emacs (and how to relate it to understanding the UI) * Apropos and small tricks to use docstring conventions to search for types * Byte compiling * Structural editing of some variety * Evaluate in other buffer, all the evaluation workflows and their tradeoffs * Persistence, be it org mode, saving scratch, writing modules, or ielm history * All the bells & whistles in the helpful package, including using it to quickly find the right manual contents * Fuzzy searches for symbols and important search keys like "-hook$" and "-functions?$" etc * Edebug & debug * LLM prompting to overcome lack of proper vocabulary & language barrier * Shortdocs * The built-in Emacs glossary * Macrostep * Tests * Process, JSON-RPC, HTTP * Probably some CL because I think the built-in loop structures are just anemic, but I want to stick to bread & butter cl-lib. That said, what do you consider bread & butter?
 Even if I don't share your views, I will try to make sure that sources of high value with at least a significant fraction of users are represented. It costs very little extra time to mention something like, "If you are doing X a lot or when you get to Y, people say try adopting Z."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm guessing that it's an indentation issue but I'm really not sure how to resolve this. I'm in Vim with tab-stops set the 3 whitespaces. I can get this example to work by omitting the fac :: Int -> Int line but this error in particular is really starting to bug me.
 The following gives a parse error at |fac 0 = 1:
 fac :: Int -> Int |n :: Int |fac 0 = 1 |fac n = n * fac (n-1) main = print (fac 42) 
 This gives a parse error on '::' at n :: Int:
 fac :: Int -> Int n :: Int fac 0 = 1 fac n = n * fac (n-1) main = print (fac 42)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i have been training for a job in the medical field (maybe a bit of an understatement in regards to the cost and mental toil, but saying i'm in med school has its implications because i'm really not.) and about two-and-a-bit months ago, i decided to start a zettelkasten. i learned all about it and wrote notes about the underlying philosophy in the zettelkasten itself, and things started off fantastic! MOCs and hub notes feel like a dream for my personal organization. higher-order learning seemed extremely necessary. disregarding the idea of separate disciplines in lieu of an understanding rooted in existing knowledge seemed very helpful.
now it's been a couple months and my zettelkasten contains over 100 zettels; i'd say about 20 regarding personal knowledge management and then about 80 medical notes. that is the problem, though. i look at other notemakers' obsidian graphs and they're one big ideaverse of notes radiating from the center. my notes, conversely, are separated into blobs by discipline or level of abstraction from reality. (e.g. anatomy [tangible] vs. study concepts [intangible]) in essence, i want to keep watching my zettelkasten grow--it is helping me retain information--but i'm a bit scared that i'm not implementing higher-order learning correctly.
this is making me unsure whether a traditional, luhmann-esque zettelkasten is the best idea for medical study. what do you think? does anyone else have trouble connecting tangible, business-related zettels to more abstract zettels?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, Flyspell highlights every single word, even if it's correct and if it exists in the dictionary. At first, I thought it's an issue with aspell, so I switched to hunspell, but the behavior is the same. I do have hunspell installed on the system, dictionaries too (using Romanian language), running hunspell -D in console shows that the dictionaries are loaded:
 LOADED DICTIONARY: /Users/claudiu/Library/Spelling/ro_RO.aff /Users/claudiu/Library/Spelling/ro_RO.dic 
 This is my spellcheck config bit from init.el:
 (setenv "DICTIONARY" "ro_RO") (setenv "DICPATH" (concat (getenv "HOME") "/Library/Spelling")) (setq ispell-program-name "hunspell") (setq ispell-really-hunspell t) (setq ispell-dictionary "ro_RO") (setq ispell-local-dictionary "ro_RO") (setq ispell-dictionary-alist '(("ro_RO" "[[:alpha:]]" "[^[:alpha:]]" "[']" nil ("-d" "ro_RO") nil utf-8))) 
 Every single word in the image below exists in the dictionary and shouldn't be highlighted. Anyone have any idea why this is happening?

 I'd hoped that typescript-ts-mode (ts for treesitter) would work for editing .js files containing jsx, but reformat at least doesn't work. It could well be my set-up, but is there anyone here using tree sitter versions of js modes successfully with react/jsx from emacs 29? If not, what is the current "best thing" - googling js/jsx with emacs opens pandora's box and I'm really pretty confused as to how best to move forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I'm a Haskell novice and have been challenged to make something like a chess engine. I love the idea of doing it in Haskell and also doing it properly™ (i.e. overengineering the hell outta it lol).
 I already have a program (involuntarily written in Java) to store/output the board state and determine whether someone won.\ What I intend to create is the following: 1. a protocol between the Java program and 2. (see below)\ this will contain things like "NEWGAME", "TURN xy", "RESPONSE zw", etc. 2. a Haskell program that implements that protocol to actually generate a good next move and send it back to the Java application, which 3. I will modify to be able to talk to my "engine"
 So what is your folks' opinion on how to structure the Haskell code / protocol?\ I came up with this: - CECP-/UCI-like protocol: one move sent at a time, my program would need to store that somehow\ however, I don't have any idea on how to elegantly do this in Haskell and wonder whether it can even be done idiomatically - get the complete board state as input each time and output the next move / new state; as easy as it gets and seems to fit really well with the functional paradigm BUT extremely inefficient and not what I would do if I was programming it in another language (also apparently not how most protocols work…)
 Dear, epic, most valued, mathematically blessed computer scientists, can you bestow some advice upon me, so I can maybe become worthy of joining your ranks one day?
 Thanks in advance and happy holidays! :)

 I've noticed that when I start the interpreter (using run-python), the interpreter doesn't have any of my variables: os.environ shows a bunch of useful variables but none of the ones I've set in my shell-config file (~/.zshrc).
 I've been digging through the code and it seems that the python interpreter process is ultimately started by make-comint-in-buffer. What is the preferred solution to ensure that this function picks up all the variables I want before starting the process?

 (global-unset-key (kbd "C-w")) (global-set-key (kbd "C-w") 'delete-window) 
 Edit: Looks like evil-mode added a whole bunch of keybindings for working with windows that all start with C-w. I think I'll try actually using those.
 One things I'm still unclear about: Did global-unset fail to remove these because they aren't global? Or did it fail because you'd have to unset each binding that begins with C-w individually? 
 I'm hoping it's not the second one. That's a lot of commands, if you have to unbind each one individually.

Since then single ESC isn't respected in tui (-nw) but works fine in gui. Same for the arrow keys. They're fine in gui but in tui they force me into insert mode (with a flash of M-o being undefined) and type ABCD.
 I get the same behaviour with -Q and then eval (require 'evil), so it's something that's changed upstream and not in my config.
 Anyone else affected and have found a solution?

 I've got the menu-bar and tool-bar hidden. But I can't figure out how to get rid of this gray bar at the very top of emacs:

 I can get rid of it using toggle-fullscreen-mode, but that also hides the system menu. I don't want fullscreen, I just want the bar gone.
 Any way to do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read 'Functional programming simplified' by Alvin Alexander, and I think I understand pure function, side effects, IO monads, type classes pretty well(although I dislike its implementation)
 But I don't understand state monads, functors or monad transformers. I tried "scala with cats" and gave up after a few chapters. So I don't know how to use cats-core
 Now can I jump to learn cats effect or zio ? For now I don't want to learn advanced Haskell-like FP concepts, but focusing on writing pure functions and handling IO in an FP way. Just don't know if cats effect or Zio require understanding of these concepts (I just want to use cats effect or zio, not trying to understand what's behind the scenes)
 And if you think it's ok, which one is simpler in you opinion? Some also say Future is enough, do you recommend I just learn how to use Future as a monad to solve real world problems?

 I don't know what Doing vfork means, all i know is that some file is missing. But how do i find out WHAT file is missing? Non of the buffers (lsp log, lsp stderr etc.) say something meaning full... how do i debug this? --debug-init is useless i think because the error dose not occur during init.

 pointfree.io converted it to:

 Here, xs is [a] and chooseInt is from QuickCheck.
 I can't figure out how the pointfree expression type checks (it does). I understand each of the following functions individually, but combined they're hurting my brain. Can you deconstruct the pointfree expression and explain it to me?
 liftM2 :: Monad m => (a1 -> a2 -> r) -> m a1 -> m a2 -> m r (<$>) :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b (,) :: a -> b -> (a, b) 
 I even get (<$>) (,) (chooseInt . (0 ,) . length), which is a function wrapped in a Functor, but liftM2??

I'd like to introduce you to yet another way to organize a knowledge base in Emacs. This is the howm package by Kazuyuki Hiraoka. Package available on Melpa.
I've been using howm daily for a year and a half now, and I can confidently say that it is a simple and elegant solution for taking notes. Howm, much like "The Archive," utilizes links as a search trigger, among other similarities.
The package is almost 21 years old, but Hiraoka continues to actively support it. I've spent the past year creating a guide for howm, and I'm glad to show you what I've come up with.
The tutorial on howm is free and you can find it in English and Russian here:

 However, I'd like not to renounce (yet?) to the comfort of GUI mail clients (Thunderbird, Evolution, Geany, any is good for me...) in some situations. So the question: is there a way to make them share the same inbox, without having to download the mail twice?. Maybe with a separate process that fetches the emails, so that Gnus does not get stuck doing network operations.
 Additional info: My mail provider is Proton Mail. The question applies mainly to Linux systems. It would be useful to have a similar setup even using Emacs for Android - but I guess it's a chimera.

 This year, my goal has been to make a guide on using the howm package.

 The language barrier hase made it difficult for the howm package to reach a wider audience outside of Japan.

 Sorry to spam you a bit recently. I promise this is the last time, at least until the New Year ;)
 One of the new features in the recent IntelliJ Scala Plugin release is the X-Ray editor mode. It displays hints next to your code without adding too much clutter, and only when you want it. Even though X-Ray was already mentioned in the release note, we - the IntelliJ Scala team - decided it's interesting enough to write about it a bit more.
 So, here's a blog post: https://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/2023/12/21/the-x-ray-mode/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Haskellers,
 I have a question about streaming libraries (streamly, conduit, streaming, etc.). I am trying to write a little application to remap user input events (keyboard, mouse, etc.) so I am dealing with low-volume, lazy streams. Additionally, the actual remapping will depend on a user configuration file. 
 I have gotten suggestions to use a streaming library to represent the basic datatype in my app, something I did look into but quickly abandoned because of a rather daunting amount of choice and considerations. However, now is the time for me to make a decision, since going back and refactoring everything after the fact is going to be a huge time-sink. So:
 I am currently under the impression that the biggest benefit of the streaming libraries is speed, and that that speed is generated by doing ghc-optimization tricks. I am also under the impression that speed is not that important in my domain, and that since I don't know which stream-transformations I will be composing at compile time (since I'll be reading the transformations from user-config), I wouldn't even be able to benefit from these performance gains.
 Is my understanding correct? Am I missing something? My home-rolled solution uses binary and a Chan and async to set up different event readers by parsing from lazy bytestrings, writing to the chan to merge the results, and then represents the input as a lazy, infinite list that then gets passed to my pure remapping engine. It seems to work fine. Am I setting myself up for some unforeseen disaster in the future? 
 The reason I've been avoiding these solutions is also just because my productive time is limited and very unreliable, so the cognitive overhead of a completely new set of abstractions comes with its own cost.
 Thank you for any advice you may proffer.

Yet none of them have really caught on with me, especially when it comes to practicality. I get that if some wrapper (List, Option, IO etc.) should be able to be called a Monad, it has to have some properties, and some laws that it should fulfill. But that still doesn't help me understand it really well, and I will forget the laws the next second and probably won't know how to implement or use a Monad in practicality. 
 Do you happen to have one golden source that made Monads 'click' for you both in what it is from a theoretical point of view, but also how to implement and use them? (Exercises would also be greatly appreciated, but I first need to understand it)

It's used for "ad hoc polymorphism" - how does this help with make a function pure and handle side effects, which I was told to be the focus of FP ? 
 And its implementation in Scala heavily relies on implicit keyword. After doing lots of implicits you can finally replace foo(bar) as bar.foo(). To me this just looks like a way of creating syntax sugar. How is it FP? 
 So I guess it's not FP by itself, but just a way to implement FP feature such as monads. Make sense?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started using Haskell as a replacement for Python, for "ad hoc computing". I guess, rather hope, I'll also write production programs in it some day, but for now I'm just enjoying this beautiful set of well thought out primitives that mathematicians and the countless people behind Haskell have laid at my hands (Thank you all!).
 Recently, GHC has started whining about using head. Now, I understand the motivations etc behind this (or I think I do), and I can see why in certain corporate settings, having a coding convention to disallow the use of head might be a totally appropriate thing to do.
 But I don't think such verboten-ness belongs to the language itself. Haskell is not a monoculture of non-partial programs, I feel it has a wider community than that. When I'm tinkering with stu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had a sports accident a couple weeks ago, looks like my knee's gonna be outta commission for half a year. My job is all walking and running, and since the injury happened on my own time, tough luck. Moved back in with the parents, so not to worry on the starving/freezing part. I have a decent local reputation in my industry, too, so long story short, this is just a very annoying setback. That's the bad news.
 Good news is that obviously, my schedule's freed up. Wanted to get back into reading forever, you can bet that's happening. And lots of things I've wanted to sink my teeth into, but never did for one reason or another. Two of them are emacs, and recreational math.
 My hope is that the reason I've never been able to sit down and work my way through the Petersen book was that I was just too sapped from work and life stuff. And apparently I got six months or so, so I'll have plenty of time to digest it. But. In case it turns out that I'm just lazy and weak, plan is to go through his beginners guide, and follow his advice of having a goal with emacs. I have two:
  
I want to learn how to do Bullet Journal-type of stuff. Make plans, write pieces for myself, that sort of thing. Heard that org-mode isn't any good for longer entries, though, so advice here would be appreciated.
 Something I can practice my math in. From taking notes, to copying out math problems and solving them, so on. I have no clue what this would look like, so again, advice appreciated.

 I'm not a developer but have worked around developers and with technology for decades. I thought I was pretty tech savvy before today. I thought Emacs + Org-mode could be my geeky self's Holy Grail playground for notes and agenda and learning and fun. I thought I'd enjoy the challenge of Emac's infamous learning curve and ascend that steep mountain with a cocky grin on my face and pride in my bones. 
 Then I installed the sucker. 
 From my Mac's Terminal via Homebrew, I might add. (Yes, yes, I was quite proud of my accomplishment when the program ran without a hitch.) I was able to swim smoothly through the Tutorial, thinking all the while, "THIS. Where has this been all my life??"

 I need to add scripting capabilities to one my software, i.e. give the user the possibility to write it's own "script" and have the program execute it. Ideally, being able to write such a script as an Haskell EDSL would have been great but I don't think it is possible (or easy). So before rolling out my own language, I was wandering what are the best options ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a condensed version of a problem I've encountered in a rewrite of a project to use associated types instead of multiparameter typeclasses. I want the type signatures in the API to be as clean as possible, and avoid the need for so many type ascriptions in code using the API, which is why I'd like to make this work somehow.
 I have a typeclass A with a non injective associated type Context
 class A a where type Context a 
 so many instances of A can have the same Context.
 Some instances of A are also instances of the class AA, that has two additional associated types, B and C.
 class (A a) => AA a where type B a type C a problematic :: Context a -> B a -> C a -> a 
 The intention is that given a Context, the combination of B a and C a uniquely identify a, but I don't know how to express this.
 I know it's possible to make constraints like
 class A a where type B a = b | b -> a 
 , but what I need is some kind of constraint with multiple parameters, like (Context a, B a, C a) -> a. How can this be achieved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 As a follow-up to the 2023.3 release of IntelliJ Scala Plugin, we've given the IntelliJ Scala Help pages a major overhaul. This includes updates to many sections as well as a few entirely new sections written from scratch. We've also added new screenshots and short videos instead of GIFs.
 You can check it all out, starting from here.
 By the way, if you think we should add or modify some sections, let us know - either here in the comments, or on our Discord server.
 Happy developing!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a large file with tables and calculations, and when a part of it is not needed anymore, I like to keep it in the file for later reference. To calculate all the sums and formulas, I do org-table-iterate-buffer-tables, which works fine, but naturally takes a while.
 Could I exempt the older parts of the org file by adding the ARCHIVE tag to the old headings? Or does it only exempt them from agenda views and exporting, as it says in the org manual? It would be great if there were a function to exempt parts of a file when calling org-table-iterate-buffer-tables.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm just planning on a personal project. I like Elm, and I want to give PureScript a try on the backend.
 Is there an easy way/tool to share types between PureScript and Elm, so I can stay a little more DRY, at least with the data I send between frontend and backend?
