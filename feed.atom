        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been using org-mode and org-roam for a bit. I'm finding that my notes are kind of getting into a mess but that's mostly because of my insane life contexts I guess.
 Here is kind of where I'm at in life, for context:
  
Work (routine stuff, development projects underway, ideas, I have a bit of a management role but it's really spread out over a bunch of contexts in and of itself (different functional areas I manage)
 Business 1
 Business 2
 Personal Life
 Personal development projects
 Education goals
 Investment goals/research
  
I like keeping notes and todos together, but I think separate contexts is a good idea so if I'm in work mode I'm not seeing all the stuff I need to do in my business. Something I'm kind of wanting to is a way to mark something as delegated to X person. I don't need them to see that I delegated it, just to remind myself that I told them to do something and to follow up.
 ​
 I started out with a regular org file for each context, then ended up creating new org files for each "thing", which created my mess. Today I decided to try creating dailies in org-roam to see how that works out.
 ​
 Any suggestions for how to keep life organized in org or org-roam when you've got so much going on. From experience, no todo list/notes manager has ever really worked that well for this for me.... a few were okay (todoist on the todo list side and evernote on the notes side.... but they both had their own issues)
 ​
 I like org and org-roam I'm just struggling with how best to setup a structure that fits such a lifestyle.
 Any thoughts or input is very welcome...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use TRAMP to connect to GitHub Codespaces via my Codespaces package. However, I noted recently that my TRAMP sessions were suffering tremendous and unignorable lag when navigating within a file. I went through my enabled modes one-by-one and was surprised to learn that vc-mode was, in this case, the culprit. Setting vc-handled-backends like so:
 (setq vc-handled-backends '(Git)) 
 had a profound effect on latency. I'm not sure why this is the case, but its original value holds a bunch of entries for VCSs that died decades ago (CVS, SCCS, RCS…): it's possible that one of my packages was using all of vc-mode's backends.
 My TRAMP sessions to Codespaces are now as responsive and fast as if I were to connect to them via VS Code. Hope this helps someone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A thought occurred to me today while I was getting ready, mentally preparing. I realized that I was feeling a bit stressed about the day but that the thought of my todo and agenda buffers had a calming effect. I thought to myself, "it's alright, you're organized and at least if there is chaos it is somewhat documented chaos and you don't have to hold it all in your mind."
 Last weekend, I took the time to do a much needed cleanup of my init.el file. I got rid of all the cruft of comments, things I'd tried but given up though not yet deleted. I made a move to using straight.el as my package manager. I switched from Ivy to Helm. I just did some things I'd been meaning to do for a while. I cleaned up my todo file and recommitted to using 'C-c a a' more throughout the day.
 I assume that many of you, like me, find a certain "gee, that's neat" quality to getting some of this working. A sense of satisfaction maybe. I like learning new ways to do things, maybe cleaner, tighter. But the thing that I keep coming back to even more than all that is that this technology, this nerdy system, has a way of calming me and making me feel better. It feels like the world has more and more information each day, more chaos, etc. Using org-mode helps me live in the world.
 I was curious to see if any of you have had similar thoughts about it?

 I'm putting together a little package to preview markdown files similarly to how they are rendered on GitHub. Previously I've used grip (and grip-mode), which are awesome, but I wanted a little more room for customization and to avoid hitting the GitHub API on every change.
 This package does the rendering locally if your Emacs has xwidget support. I'd really appreciate any feedback anyone has!

 Problem is the example projects there all use stack to import pure cabal projects, the latter of which do have mixins, but are not stack-ified themselves. In my case, I want to be able to add something to package.yaml or stack.yaml like:
 -- package.yaml (or stack.yaml) cabal-fields: mixins: base hiding (Prelude) - relude (Relude as Prelude) - relude 
 or something like that, just so that the .cabal file stack generates has this option enabled. I haven't been able to figure out how to do this. Some help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently studying Secrets of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler Inliner by Jones & Marlow (2002), and am trying to understand the "subtlety" they mention about the rapier algorithm.
 On the bottom left corner of page 7, they mention:
  
There is one other important subtlety in this algorithm: in the case where x is not in theta we must delete x from the substitution, denoted phi \ x. How could x be in the domain of the substitution, but not be in scope?
  
However, the authors do not elaborate much further due to space constraints.
 I'm trying to understand what they meant by this comment. Although I can fabricate inputs that produce the scenario they describe, I'm not sure what concrete example would lead to that input, nor why it's important to handle it the way they do.
 Also, the paper only shows two cases of their substitution algorithm that handles lambdas. Do we fall through to the second case if we fail the guard of the first case (i.e., when we match on a lambda introduces a variable already in-scope)? That is, am I correct in reading that as pseudo-Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am really new to Haskell and I came across this discussion about how closures in Haskell can be used to mimic objects in traditional OOP. 
 Needless to say, I did not understand much of the discussion. What is really confusing to me is that, if A is an instance of an object (in the traditional sense) then I can change and update some property A.property of A. This doesn't create a new instance of A, it updates the value. Exactly, how is this particular updating achieved via closures in Haskell? 
 I understand that mutability can have bad side effects and all. But if a property of an instance of an object, call it A.property for example, were to be updated many times throughout a program how can we possibly keep track of that in Haskell?
 I would really appreciate ELI5 answer if possible. Thank you for your time!!!

 On the other hand python-mode provides some functionality (like python-shell-send-buffer or python-shell-send-defun) to interact with an active, locally running python3 REPL.
 I'd like to be able to send Python code from a Python-file buffer directly (without me copying and pasting) to the MicroPython REPL.
 Any idea how to achieve that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not an emacs power user nor very proficient at elisp.
 I use magit quite heavily in emacs, and I'm regularly working on multiple git repositories at the same time. These are different repositories/worktrees for the same project, just with different branches checked out. I'm not sure if it is relevant, but these are Perl projects, using cperl-mode, and each project has a single TAGS files at the project root. The first time I use `M-.` (`xref-find-definitions`), I get prompted to load a TAGS file, and I select the one for the current repository I'm using. This works as expected. However when I happen to be editing a file from a different repository and hit M-., the previously loaded TAGS file is still used, so this brings me to the source file from the wrong repository. Since the files look identical, I don't notice this and regularly make edits in the wrong git worktree.
 I saw that I can load multiple tags tables using visit-tags-table, and then switch between them using select-tags-table. Is there any way to automate this so that when I use `M-.` it automatically chooses the TAGS file closest to the current file path? I looked into project.el and projectile, but I couldn't find any examples for how to do this.

However, there are limitations, for example, org-modern add space paddings to improve the visuals, which you cannot do with these two variables.
 Exactly for that reason, I will have little use for this discovery, and would rather keep it out of my .emacs.d. But hey, maybe someone would make use of this somehow :).
 You should be able to see an example also below. 
 (with-eval-after-load 'org-faces (setq org-todo-keyword-faces (append (cl-loop for todo in '("TODO" "NEXT" "STARTED" "PROJECT" "HOLD") with faces = '(:height 0.8 :inherit (org-modern-todo)) collect (cons todo faces)) (cl-loop for todo in '("CANCELLED" "DONE") with faces = '(:height 0.8 :inherit (org-modern-done)) collect (cons todo faces))) org-priority-faces (cl-loop with end = org-priority-lowest for i from org-priority-highest to end collect (list i :inherit 'org-modern-priority))))

I use it for everything. I occasionally would like a CLI tool that doesn't exist on apt, and so I build it myself. I used to use C for this, and now it's Haskell! The other day I was thinking of spinning up a chess clone because I wanted to build an AI that could beat me at chess (without looking up how chess engines work, just as a puzzle) and I thought, why not Haskell?
 Something about programming in Haskell makes me feel like a god genius programmer. She's so fast, so sleek, such a pure functional mathematical language. It's easily my favorite language by far and I just can't quite figure out what it is that makes me geek the fuck out about it.

 f :: a -> Bool
 f x = x==0 
 However, since im using the "==" operator, to tell haskell that i wont be using any other type other than the ones to which (==) has instances, Id make it this correct? 
 f :: (Eq a) => a -> Bool
 f x = x==0 
 But this throws an error telling me i also have to include (Num a) =>
 Why is that? I'm not using any operator that is in the Num a class... Why does it need this? Isn't the whole point of overloading to restrict "a" to only be a type which has an instance in the used operator/function?? What makes me add (Num a) => here too?

 I'm going to start playing with it but thought I'd see if anyone else has gotten it to work. It might be that I will need to set :ensure nil in each so use-package doesn't try to load the package since el-get will have already done it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's do it.
 What's the best style set of keybindings (in your opinion) for Emacs, and "Why?".
 Background:
  
I ask this since I have a keybinding to easily switch to Vim style keybindings a la 'Evil Mode', but only do so for programming purposes. 
 Everywhere else I use Emacs style keybindings (Org Mode, etc).
 I also use a few custom Hydras as well for weird things like buffer rotation, etc.
  
Curious what you crazy Emacs wizards use these days (ex: Xah Fly Keys, etc). Feel free to provide the "What" you use individual keybinding sets for as well.
 Let's have at it, let the best keybindings win! :)

 While I love org-mode, and would much rather use it than any other option, I still have a hard time because I manage a lot of my tasks through my phone. Same for content consumption, I do a lot on my phone thus cannot save anything easily in org.
 I've tried orgzly, but it does not really fit me. 
 How do you manage all that ?
 Thanks !

 The rust code are mainly borrowed from agreety. And I am using the Emacs Module in Rust crate here.
 For those who are not familar with greetd. greetd is a minimal, agnostic and flexible login manager daemon.

 Is everyone just locked on 8.6 or earlier like we are?
 It seems like https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs/issues/821 is a rigid dealbreaker for any sizable project.
 Our setup of using a hybrid of ghcjs-8.6, ghc-8.6 and ghc-8.10 works well enough, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't being heavily stress tested.
 I'm hoping that ghc-9.6 can potentially come to the rescue with a JS backend, but I was curious if there are other solutions on the horizon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just thought I'd document this fix here.
 I have Emacs running portably on Dropbox through a batch script that sets the HOME environment variable:
 REM Set the environment variable HOME, which Emacs uses as the base directory. set HOME=%~dp0 REM Run Emacs, passing any parameters to it as well. "D:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\emacs-28.1\bin\runemacs.exe" %* 
 I began getting this error whenever I tried to list ELPA packages:
 Failed to verify signature archive-contents.sig: No public key for _____________ created at 2022-10-18T08:05:04+1100 using RSA Command output: gpg: keyblock resource '/d/Dropbox/Apps/emacs/.emacs.d/d:/Dropbox/Apps/emacs/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/pubring.kbx': No such file or directory gpg: Signature made Tue Oct 18 08:05:04 2022 AUSEST gpg: using RSA key _________________ gpg: Can't check signature: No public key 
 My googling led me to this Stack Exchange thread which noted that this was caused by the homedir expansion producing an invalid directory path.
 The fix in my init.el is therefore:
 (setq package-gnupghome-dir "elpa/gnupg") 
 This creates the keys in the directory that Emacs expects (.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/) and allows the whole thing to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using an alist as a means of counting occurrences of characters in a string. However, the values associated with a key in the alist are persistent across function calls, even though I reset the alist in a let form (and, well, it's inside a function!). Here is a minimal working example. Calling my/test multiple times continually increases the alist values:
 (defun my/test () (let ((my/alist '((a . 0) (b . 0)))) (incf (alist-get 'a my/alist)) (incf (alist-get 'b my/alist)) my/alist)) 
 What am I doing wrong? Something tells me the problem is with incf, but I cannot understand how my/alist is stored in memory, since it should have its scope inside the function and be reset when let is run.

 Can we great a type of unknown amount of .... data?
 I know with record syntax we can create 
 data somedata ={ sum:: String, sum:: Int}
 What's stopped me from using Haskell for my everyday data science projects was with record syntax I would to modify things so the types and headers to the csv files matched.
 Which is a pain if I am just wanting to download data and play with it.
 Is there a way to create types, say similar to a Dataframe in Python or R where you can turn a CSV to a DataFrame?

Anyone do this today, or have advice on how to configure Eglot for the kernel? All I have ever used is cscope and ctags. I'd like to get it working so that the LSP server picks up the correct headers for the build arch and picks up all the GCC flags.
 I also usually run my builds inside of a container so I don't use my system's gcc toolchain.
 I am not an Emacs wizard, so detailed instructions for an idiot are most welcome.

 This should really be accompanied by a blog post, and it's kinda there in my notes. Would love some feedback.

 I decided to propose a Haskell devroom (like a one/half-days pecialist track or miniconf) for FOSDEM 2023, to be held February 4--5 in Brussels (main site; call-for-devrooms). It would be great to promote Haskell among this audience and hopefully attract new contributors / community members.
 Unfortunately I left it quite late (deadline submission is today). I only just realised I need a secondary contact (i.e. co-organiser) to submit the proposal. So... any volunteers?
 Ideally you are located in Europe or definitely planning to attend FOSDEM. If you are willing, please message me here on Reddit or mail frase at frase dot id dot au. I think I all need right now is your name and email address (and enthusiasm).
 The text of my proposal may be found at https://github.com/frasertweedale/talks/blob/master/2022-02-xx-fosdem-haskell-devroom/proposal.md.
 I have experience organising and hosting FP miniconfs at linux.conf.au including running the CFP etc. I expect FOSDEM will be similar, just on the other side of the world from Australia, where I live.
 Thank you!

 No problem, I thought, I'll just create a parallel directory structure and symlink things in places, and then import that into lsp. However, at some point in the process of importing the project (based on Maven pom files) it canonicalises some paths and ends up importing the original directory structure.
 I realise this is more of an underlying Eclipse issue, rather than an Emacs one, but does anybody have a good suggestion for how to work round this?

 The issue is that when the file is moved, the buffer opened doesn't really know about it and after any change in the buffer and then save, the file gets saved into old location.
 How do I associate a buffer with new location? I found somewhere that I can use `write-file` function and it suppose to change "the pointer" to file but it didn't. It does write to specified location but save-buffer still saves it into old file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve spent some time this summer extending Monad-Bayes, a
probabilistic programming library in Haskell. This was done in the context of a
Tweag open source fellowship, under the supervision of Dominic Steinitz. These
improvements are part of the upcoming 1.0 release of the library.
Briefly, what’s Monad-Bayes about? Like Church, Gen and
Pyropyro (among other probabilistic programming languages), it allows a user
to specify a Bayesian model as a program, and automates the process of
inferring the specified distribution. Unlike other languages, it is a
first-class library of its host language (Haskell), rather than an embedded
language. This means that any language feature in the host language is
available to you. It also means that you can have distributions over absolutely
anything. For in…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to better understand (and possibly, edit) some of the C files in the latest version of Emacs.
 Does anybody know of any good resources that go over what the general design patterns are, best practices, and tips on debugging?
 (Search engines haven't been much help as most combinations of 'emacs' and 'C code' lead to results about configuring Emacs as an IDE for C)
 I am pretty familiar with Emacs-Lisp, and I can write and understand C pretty well, but I would like to get a good understanding of all the Emacs-specific things I'm seeing in the C code, such as how to go from C variables and structs to Lisp objects, the DEFUN macro, etc.
 The motivation behind this is that, as noted in a previous post, I've noticed that the xwidget-webkit feature is (partially) broken in the latest version for MacOS. I would like to try out some possible fixes: it looks like most issues are simply due to the fact that many functions are only defined for the GTK framework, and not Mac's NextStep/Cocoa framework.
 Also, if anybody wants to help out with this effort, please let me know.
 ​
 UPDATE:
  
if you're interested in understanding Emacs C source-code, take a look at this section of the official manual: I found the part about Writing Emacs Primitives especially helpful. Many thanks to u/7890yuiop!!!
 If you're interested in the xwidget patches I'm working on, I've created this fork of the emacs mirror. I don't know if I'll be able to fix everything, but it's looking good and I've already implemented the estimated-load-progress function

 https://github.com/keithfancher/haskell-notes/blob/master/haskell-notes.md
 These are some notes I started taking about Haskell, specifically about topics I found confusing or which seemed to have many disparate sources of documentation. There's stuff about installation, toolchain, and of course some oddities of the language itself. It collects some basic summaries of the info that I've gleaned so far and a bunch of links to stuff written by people a lot more knowledgeable than I am.
 Of course, to reiterate: I am a beginner. So take it all with a grain of salt! But that can also be useful, since I probably have a similar perspective to all the other beginners out there.
 Also note that it's a work in progress! It'll grow as I continue to learn (and write down) new stuff.
 Anyway, hope this helps somebody!

 I am learning Haskell because I've heard so many great things. I had heard of the language before but Software Unscripted has inspired me to pursue it seriously and dedicate some time to it. 
 So far it's really interesting! I've not had that "ah-ha!" moment but it's only been a week or so. 
 One thing I'm wondering: Can I change the cabal output directory? 
 Right now the output goes to:
  /home/chris/projects/MyPackage-CLI/dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-9.0.2/MyPackage-CLI-0.1.0.0/x/MyPackage-CLI/build/MyPackage-CLI/MyPackage-CLI 
 That is a mouthful lol! I suppose it doesn't matter until I need to deploy (thanks to cabal run) but I am curious to know if I can just have a ~/projects/MyPackage-CLI/bin/MyPackage-CLI -- or something like that. 
 Any ideas? I've searched around and mostly I've found ways of changing cabal itself, not the output or bin directory. 
 Thanks in advance!

In emacs i got this indentation in a file. When i clicking tab it was directly going 15 space forward after std::cout << "enter another: ";. The situation persist in just one file. Any idea what did this happen?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, 
 I just released a fork of all-the-icons-completion. I've added support for more completion categories (imenu, M-x, and more) by taking code from all-the-icons-ivy-rich. I've also added a few quality of life improvements, like proper icon aligning and scaling (once again ported from all-the-icons-ivy-rich). If you use all-the-icons-completion I'd recommend giving my fork a try.

 A specific combination of things makes lsp-mode (with lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode) cause lines below the cursor to move. Those circumstances are: 
  
Using one of the themes from Prot's package ef-themes
 
cc-mode with lsp-mode, lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode 
  
There is no problem with the identical configuration using haskell/lsp-haskell or python/lsp-pyright or any other language. 
 Nor is there a problem using a different theme e.g. modus-vivendi 
 This video shows 3 short clips to demonstrate the problem. 
  
theme: ef-dark, editing a C file showing the unwanted movement
 
identical setup after using counsel-load-theme and choosing modus-vivendi- no unwanted movement
 
theme: ef-dark, but editing a haskell file again using lsp-mode with lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode - no unwanted movement
 
 I'm stuck now and looking for ideas to help me discover what could cause this and how to fix it.

 #+TODO: TODO WAIT | DONE * TODO This is a test :work: * WAIT This is another test :work: 
 Run (org-tags-view nil "work+TODO=\"WAIT\"") and you will see, as expected, an agenda view containing only the task tagged "WAIT". 
 Quit the agenda and call org-todo-list, then run org-agenda-filter, and enter work+TODO="WAIT" at the prompt. Do you get the exact same result? I had assumed I would, but I do not. Instead I get this message: 
 ‘+TODO’ filter ignored because tag/category is not represented 
 So, questions: 
  
Is this as it should be? 
 Is there a way of using org-agenda-filter to filter out tasks with a specific todo keyword?
  
I realize I could do this: 
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("p" "Test" tags "+work+TODO=\"WAIT\""))) 
 or perhaps use org-agenda-filter-by-regexp. My question is just whether org-agenda-filter should allow me to find all entries with a particular todo keyword, and if not, I guess I'd want to know why not?

I pop the disk into my computer; and while the computer recognizes it, it says the disk is unreadable. So I Google what emacs even is. He was into coding, and was even trying to create his own pixel art computer game thing. I figure the backup could be related to that kind of stuff.
 How do I get this CD to open? I installed emacs on my computer (I think?) and nothing changed? 
 (I do realize he could have also used it as a journal. Honestly, I want answers to questions, and I'll never get them, now. Part of me hopes it is his journal. I'm already in therapy so it would just be one more thing to discuss, I guess. I won't let my mom know. I'm desperate. Thank you.)

I'm using a current build of emacs 29.0.50 on X (with StumpWM/XMonad and picom), it has cairo, built with gtk3, regular alpha works... but no change when setting alpha-background.
 Can anyone confirm this works for them on X with picom? I've heard it working on Wayland with Sway, and of the emacs fork that had this code initially on X, but what about on the current version of emacs with X?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm new to Scala and I'm following Martin Odersky's course on Coursera Functional Programming Principles in Scala. I'm also using IntelliJ IDEA. I set up my environment following the course but it seems that my code is trying to compile Scala 2 rather than Scala 3.
 When I run the following code in IntelliJ: 
 val x = 10 if x < 0 then println("negative") else if x == 0 then println("zero") else println("positive") 
 I get this error:
 /Users/myname/Desktop/miscellaneous/courses/functional_programming_principles/scala-project/src/main/scala/example/example.worksheet.sc:3:4 '(' expected but identifier found. if x < 0 then 
 When I run scala --version in my terminal I get Welcome to Scala 3.2.0 (11.0.16.1, Java OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM) and my REPL also works in Scala 3. 
 I'm sure this is related but I'm not sure how to fix it:
  
In IDEA, under External Libraries, OpenJDK 18 and Scala SDK 2.13.10 are listed.
  
Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks
 EDIT: I fixed the issue by simply starting a new project and following the IDEA new project wizard. Helped me select the JDK and Scala version that I wanted. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guys, I'm migrating from Vim to Emacs and my init.el is still very basic. I've installed evil, evil-collection and which-key. Overall, things are working pretty well, but I'm having trouble when using *Buffer List* (you know, the buffer menu invoked with C-x C-b or :ls<cr>).
 When I use C-h k o, for example, it shows the proper mapping defined in evil-collection: o is mapped to tabulated-list-sort.
 However, if I use C-h m, it says o is "Select that buffer in another window". And when I invoke which-key-show-mode, is says o is mapped to Buffer-menu-other-window.
 Am I missing something here? Is there a package that "glues" all the help systems together?

 Consumption of social media typically necessitates few repeated actions - like, share, comment and follow. If these actions are assigned to convenient keyboard keys, the consumption becomes easier. Here's an attempt to unify this experience using GNU Emacs and tumblesocks.

 I have all of the above installed --- and working. With Golang, the functions autocomplete with the parenthesis and placeholders for the args, as expected. So the plumbing works.
 But, when working with Javascript (with ts-ls), the functions and methods autocomplete without parenthesis or placeholders. So, for exemple, "document.querySel" autcompletes to "document.querySelector" -- NOT "document.querySelector(selectors)" or something like that.
 Again: yasnippet is installed and working and the entire thing works in other languages. Does anyone know why it doesn't work with Javascript?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a novice emacs user. In an attempt to set the font in my init.el file, I came across two different functions: set-fontset-font and set-frame-font.
 set-frame-font sets the font of current frame correctly, whereas set-fontset-font doesn't do anything. To my understanding, invoking (set-fontset-font t ...) is basically modifying the default font set, making new frames to use the font I specified, so this behavior is surprising to me.
 I frequently fiddle with code that contains non-alphanumeric characters (Hangul, Hiragana/Katakana, Emoji...), and I use different fonts for each of them. It would be great if I can use set-fontset-font as that function has this feature built-in. Is there a way to make it a one-function-to-rule-them-all?
 P.S. I tried modifying default-frame-alist with (font . "fontset-default") but apparently that is not allowed? Now my init.el is broken!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Doom emacs, with Evil mode.
 I am learning using Org Mode and I wanted to cycle through single Headlines by using the Tab key but what I can only cycle through is the first level under the Headline I am pressing the Tab key upon.
 To clarify, I don't want to use the S-Tab to cycle through all Headlines, but I only want to cycle through one Headline and its sub-headlines.
 How can I cycle through all nested Headlines, one by one, with evil mode
 I am sorry if that's a pretty noob question. Thank you all for your help
 Edit: I've found in the manual a workaround (which is actually the official combo key for the action I was looking for) by using C-c C-k. That key combo will expand all subtrees of a headline, recursively. To close the main headline back, I'll use za.
 Sadly, default vim z operations in evil-org look not working. E.G. zO is supposed to perform the operation I was looking for, or zr doesn't open one subtree at a time.
 Edit 2: In the lang: org README file from Doom Emacs I see that this behavior was intentional and that can be reversed.
  
 TAB was changed to toggle only the visibility state of the current subtree, rather than cycle through it recursively. This can be reversed with:  #+begin_src emacs-lisp (after! evil-org (remove-hook 'org-tab-first-hook #'+org-cycle-only-current-subtree-h)) #+end_src

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past month I've been working on implementing my first OOP language with Haskell .. implementing the syntax and context analysis was very easy for me because I'm very aware of the fact that we build parsers using stateful monads using one of the already available libraries (like parsec for example)... so that went easy after defining the context-free grammars that is not left-recursive, and then implementing the parsec-functions to every non-terminating symbol in the grammars... so that went easy with no hiccups... 
 But after I dived into the context analysis that's where shit hit the fan.. it seemed that my programming model has either been very bad or I'm a bad software-engineer because functions started to become very ugly due to many parameters that are passed to the functions, and many other reasons that I don't how to start to explain, but in summary whatever makes haskell beautiful I managed to make it very ugly and complicated with my architecture design..
 So my question is: we already have stateful monads and parsers like parsec as an architectural model to implement the syntax analysis and context analysis. Are there also standardized models to implement the other steps in compilers like the context analysis? Is there literature that answers this question in regard to Haskell?
 Edit: while implementing the context analysis I became very aware of the fact that need zippers because I needed to be very aware ot the context of every variable and method which then I did and made the job much easier, so maybe that's part of the answer that I'm seeking?

 Does the visible "Echo Area" live in a buffer?

 I run Emacs on a Mac. I install it via homebrew. I install packages with straight-use-package. INFOPATH isn't defined in my environment.
 When I enter Info in the usual way (C-h i) what I see is not optimal.
  
There is no entry for Emacs Lisp, among others.
 There are things for which there is no actual Info help. Example: "Info-find-file: Info file ‘ada-mode’ does not exist; consider installing it"
 There are almost 350 lines in the top level of Info and it is full of things I don't care about, such as EUDC, 'Gawk work flow', and 22 separate entries for things in GNU Gettext Utilities.
  
Info-directory-list looks like this (where <$HOME> actually represents my correct home directory)

        <updated>2022-10-15T18:41:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "snapshot" binaries of Emacs 29 for Windows posted today should be somewhat less fragile while running without GCC/libgccjit (e.g. MSYS2 installed and on the Windows path).
 https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-29/?C=M;O=D
 Note: the snapshot is dated Oct 13, 2022, but I posted it today, Oct 15th; took me a few days. The last included commit was cbd04ad3d572850775f18bde868c71abcde733ed.
 Anyway, this build use a new "trampolines" target for make. This target pre-compiles (AOT) trampolines, infrastructure that allows natively compiled elisp to call redefined elisp primitives, which are then included with the installer, zip and no-deps.zip distributables. While redefining primitives is discouraged, it does happen, especially via advice APIs.
 Including these trampolines should enable installing and running (e.g.) packages that advise elisp primitives. Previously (in all 29 snapshots and GNU windows binary distributions of Emacs 28) that might have failed because Emacs unconditionally creates trampolines on the fly if they do not exist when needed. Precompiling the trampolines should prevent Emacs from triggering async native compilation even when native-comp-available-p was returning nil, to make them.
 TIA for bug reports & feedback!
 PS, in case others are building Emacs with native comp enabled and not distributing GCC/libgcc with, the new make target isn't on the Emacs 28 branch (yet). It should be fairly easy to patch it in or manually add something like this to your packaging process after success of make all, before make install (or make install-strip or whtv)
  (mapatoms (λ (f) (when (subr-primitive-p (symbol-function f)) (or (comp-trampoline-search f) (comp-trampoline-compile f))))) 
 This code comes from message #50 in bug #58318, and worked for me (however, the 29 snapshot binaries do use the new make target, now - they don't use the above snippet).
 Edit: un-mangled the code block

 I zoom out and on the right bottom corner it tells me how many "steps" I zoomed back ( (-1), (-2), etc.), and when I press C-+ even just one time it takes me back to "0" ie the default font size I set.
 This what I have in my config regarding fonts.
 ;; ----------- FONTS ----------- ;; main font stuff (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Comic Mono" :size 24) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Ubuntu" :size 24) doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Comic Mono" :size 24)) ;; make italics and bold show without the slash and asterisk (not working) (after! doom-themes (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t doom-themes-enable-italic t)) ;; italic comments and keywords (not working) (custom-set-faces! '(font-lock-comment-face :slant italic) '(font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic)) 
 I'm sorry if the question is high noobeness, I'm not very practical with this and I don't have any idea of how to move forward. I love editing org files in emacs though, so these headaches are worth it.

One of the greatest difficulties in understanding the Zettelkasten Method is to separate its specific characteristics from actual knowledge work. Or, how I like to phrase it: “Link knowledge, not notes.” Working with our Zettelkasten is the physical (or digital) manifestation of our thinking. It provides a framework that allows us to think through writing and to create an increasingly complex thinking machine that can help us think deeper than being on our own. The Zettelkasten Method provides a framework for our thinking, but does not prescribe what and how we think.

Start typing @ and get an auto-complete helm box with all the people I have in the system. Selecting one would should the nickname I defined for them in this sytem
 Have a capture template (for example when creating a meeting) where I can select the people I have in the system (multi-select) and assign them to a "with" property under the meeting heading
 Click on a @-link and see all the headings under which this person is mentioned.
 Assign a TODO to someone and later see all the TODOs by them (today I do this with tags but it doesn't work well with people with the same first names unless my tags keep a @first_lastname pattern for everyone) Closest I have seen so far is this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/64502 but it's part of a much more complex package which seems overkill. Plus, I don't see how I could easily use with a capture template.
  
Any ideas? Thanks!

 If core domain object is near service and repository then that module must include the dependency to the SQL or other database library. Now if your other project doesn't use SQL but they need your core object it will drag all the libraries with it.
 If you separate out the core domain class into a submodule that doesn't contain any dependencies, then you can import that to other projects, but then it's suddenly not package-by-feature. Or can we achieve a hybrid model where the core object is separate and then all the rest, SQL, HTTP, API, JSON are in one other module that is the app.

 type mismatch; found : cmd.Persist (which expands to) XXXXEntity#Persist required: XXXXEntity.this.Persist .onCommand[XXXXCommand, XXXXCreatedReply] { case (cmd: XXXXCommand, ctx, state) => cmd.apply(ctx, state) } 
 ​
 I created A Command interface and created Commands from it.
 trait XXXXCommands[R] extends ReplyType[R] { override type ReplyType = Rtype Context = XXXXEntity#CommandContext[ReplyType]type State =XXXXStatetype Persist = XXXXEntity#Persist def apply(ctx: Context, stateOpt: Option[State]): Persist = {stateOpt match {case None => initial(ctx)case Some(state) if state.XXXXStatus == XXXXStatus.Success => success(ctx, state)}} protected def rejectByStatus(ctx: Context, state: State): XXXXEntity#Persist = {ctx.invalidCommand(s"${this.getClass.getSimpleName}: Invalid operation. {Id: ${state.XXXXId}, Status: ${state.XXXXStatus}")ctx.done} protected def reject(message: String, ctx: Context): XXXXEntity#Persist = {ctx.invalidCommand(message)ctx.done} protected def initial(ctx: Context): XXXXEntity#Persistprotected def success(ctx: Context, state: State): XXXXEntity#Persist} 
 I am using (or trying to use) Lagom framework. Persist is a trait that is inside of the PersistentEntity trait. Because of the the inner traits I tried to take the Persist inside the Entity that I created via hash (#) operation. That may be the problem.
 I dont know how could I fix it but its so weird to have that problem. This would exactly work in java but why it did not in scala?
 Edit:
 It happens when I try to run the code below.
 override def behavior: Behavior = Actions().onCommand[XXXXCommand, XXXXCreatedReply] { case (cmd: XXXXCommand, ctx, state) => cmd.apply(ctx, state) }

In the coming weeks I'm considering releasing my hyper-minimal take on Zettelkasten to a wider audience. My rationale has always been to squash complexity in favor of a quick & lightweight method of retrieving notes (nothing at all wrong with other apps that have all the bells & whistles btw). The same codebase runs on any of Windows, Linux, BSD (Apple likely to be included soon as well) with zero issues.
Some screen shots...



The interface as you noticed is commandline driven & features a REPL (Read Evaluate Print & Loop) to process commands. As it stands now, the source code is merely 27 Kilobytes in size & would be great to toss on a USB drive so your notes are easy to access. No smartphone interface as I'm not much interested in that domain. At any rate, if this sounds like something you might be interested in, check in every now & again & I'll hopefully post a download link eventually.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I want to write a simple converter from lambda calculus expressions to SKI expressions using these 6 rules. I have my two types
 data Expr = Var String | Abs String Expr | App Expr Expr data SKI = S | K | I | App SKI SKI 
 With these types, rule 5 does not quite work using general recursion:
 general :: Expr -> SKI general (Abs v1 (Abs v2 e)) | free v1 e = general (Abs v1 $ general (Abs v2 e)) 
 Understandably, this doesn't work because Abs requires its second arg to be an Expr but general returns SKI.
 I've tried implementing it using various recursion schemes (futu, histo, para and ana), but to no success. Is there a way to do this without having to merge the two types together into one?
 And additionally, if something can't be implemented using general recursion, can it be implemented using recursion schemes? Or is general recursion strictly "more powerful"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found that completing-read + embark-act-all rocks. For example, I can update all lsp-related package in straight.el by calling straight-pull-package and then type lsp- to get a list of completion candidates with lsp in the name. Then I call embark-act-all and pull all the selected packages.
 But it would be useful to be able to switch from an arbitrary completing-read minibuffer into completing-read-multiple via a key-press, collect multiple candidates (which don't necessarily have matching substrings), and then just run the original command for each of the selected candidates, e.g. via embark-act-all. This would be much more convenient than just running the command multiple times or what I sometimes do, mapping the function over the list in elisp (M-: (seq-map #'<command> candidates))
 I could write my own function which calls completing-read-multiple, like straight-pull-package-crm, but it would be nice if something like that would be possible from any command. I'm asking because I thought something like that should already exist somewhere or be possible somehow with existing functionality in emacs/embark.
 Feel free to propose other solutions to my problem, as what I'm asking might be an XY problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I just attended a job‍ that was largely JVM-focused. I'm not new to the JVM; I've done previous work in Java (1.6/Android) and spent a large chunk of time writing Clojure. My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I'll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I'd feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I've also been there and done that, and I like types now. Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We're a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. I'm looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general. I'm not opposed to pragmatism either; it's one thing I like about Scala. It seems like there's a lot of excellent libraries because of the existing JVM ecosystem. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To me, I've always thought that data constructors should have a lowercase first letter, because they are term-level and behave very similarly to functions. For example,
 data T = D Int f :: Int -> T f = D 
 Here, f and D are very similar conceptually, so why should they be represented differently?
 I've read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6237775/why-does-haskell-force-data-constructors-first-letter-to-be-upper-case but the only compelling argument to me seems to be pattern matching, since data constructors can be matched on but functions cannot. However as someone who learnt haskell recently it seems to me that it would be clearer if data constructors had a lower case first letter to make clear their term-levelness.

 I’m very efficient in Scala 2, good old runtime-programming and FP, but macro always felt like something not to touch in Scala 2.
 Now there’s Scala 3, and metaprogramming seems to go mainstream. The problem though is that I cannot get used to programming at compile-time. Everything I have in my project is someone else’s copypasta. I’ve read the docs and few blogposts, but still not capable to write it myself. 
 I’m looking for small Scala 3 exclusive (mixing it with 2 makes much harder to distinguish) projects with use of metaprogramming where I can learn more and perhaps contribute. Ducktape (https://github.com/arainko/ducktape) is a great example. Any blog posts would be even better.

Writing generators for property-based tests is an art, and there’s often a
trade-off between how many test cases are generated and how meaningful each of
them is. When considering stateful systems, this problem is exacerbated, because
any action taken now may constrain the available actions for the future. This

Vuiet is supposed to show playing track information on the modeline - right about where you’d normally have line/char line counts. Mine very rarely does this; I haven’t exactly pinned it down, but SOME buffers will actually show this information. It doesn’t seem to be vuiet-specific ones exactly, but I think that might be it. 
 I’d really appreciate any suggestions for where I could look to pull that info out of vuiet and add it to my modeline. 
 I tried placing (vuiet-update-mode-line) in the modeline config variable (forget the exact name) but that didn’t help. 
 Sometimes when I run the command manually I can actually see it for what looks like a frame or two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So let's say I have a library and a test-suite and my Cabal file looks something like this: 
 ```cabal library exposed-modules: MyLib build-depends: base >=4.14.3.0 hs-source-dirs: src default-language: Haskell2010
 test-suite test type: exitcode-stdio-1.0 main-is: Test.hs build-depends: base >=4.14.3.0 , my-lib hs-source-dirs: test default-language: Haskell2010 ```
 I want to test a "private" function from MyLib. The function is not supposed to be exported by the module. But of course then I can't import the function from my test suite. What's the standard way to deal with this? 
  
Put the tests together with MyLib and export the tests? 
 Make a dedicated module just to re-export the "public" functions and for all other modules just export everything? 
 Never test private functions?
  
All of these options seem flawed to me.

 I've been using xwidget-webkit in Emacs for a while now, thanks to d12frosted's great Emacs Plus Homebrew formulae which include it as a build option. If you don't know, this feature allows you to run an instance of a browser from within an Emacs buffer (if you run MacOS, the browser is Safari, though this might be configurable -- I'm not sure). I find it a great and useful feature when browsing code-documentation online or using search engines for quick questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: I need to specify a :files value inside the use-package form, but this has irritating side-effects.
 I install packages with straight and use-package.
 I use the transient package. I noticed that its info manual didn't appear for me with C-h i. I dug deeper and realized that .../straight/build/transient didn't contain a dir file or any of the doc files. Several other packages, like orderless, did include dir in their straight/build directories, but their repo directories also happen to store the doc files at the top level.
 transient is different in that its repo has a docs/ subdirectory, which seemed to be the source of the problem. But magit has a similar repo structure, and its docs were installing fine.
 I noticed that the recipe for magit has a :files key which pulls in the doc file. Adding
 :straight (:files (:defaults "docs/*")) 
 to my (use-package 'transient ...) form appears to do the trick - and automagically triggers a make docs command for transient somehow - but now I have two wrinkles:
  
straight rebuilds transient every time I start Emacs
 I get a warning "Warning (straight): Two different recipes given for "transient" (:files cannot be both nil and (:defaults "docs/*"))"
  
The first issue is annoying, but isn't a showstopper. I don't restart Emacs very often and my startup time is already slow.
 The second issue worries me, because I don't know whether it means that updated docs will actually get installed in the future. Presumably the clash is between my (use-package 'transient ...) and the recipe that gets used when transient is handled as a dependency of magit (which I also use). But which recipe is actually used to install transient now? Is it getting installed twice every time?
 I don't know why the transient docs aren't getting installed "out of the box" as they apparently are for everyone else. What might I be doing wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I’m pretty new to scala and the usage of underscore to simplify lambdas seems a little obscure to me. For example I can write this:
  readLine.split(" ").map(_.toInt)  And it works as expected, but then I try:  vertices(v).filter(!(visited(_))  and the compiler would complain:
  
value unary_! is not a member of Int => Boolean
  
So I end up writing my lambda expressions with _ and if I see an error then I expand them to “true” lambdas like:  vertices(v).filter(vertex => !(visited(vertex)) 
 This is a little frustrating, so what I want to know, is, what are the rules that the underscore syntax OK in the first case, but wrong in the second one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write FFI bindings for librrd. My code can be found here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/tree/context-bindings
 This is the first time I use FFI and I have not come very far. I can query the version of the library and do some calls to rrd_*_error which run but return empty results. So I'm not even sure I am missing something very basic here.
 This is what I observe: The tests in general run fine, until I enable the one defined here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/blob/context-bindings/test/RRDTool/LowLevelSpec.hs#L41 which calls rrd_get_context. The tests simply crash then:
 $ cabal test --test-show-details=always Running 1 test suites... Test suite hs-rrd-test: RUNNING... Test suite hs-rrd-test: FAIL 
 Started in a repl I get the following:
 ghci> :add *RRDTool.LowLevel Ok, two modules loaded. ghci> rrd_get_context cabal: repl failed for hs-rrd-0.1.0.0. The build process segfaulted (i.e. SIGSEGV). 
 The code of rrd_get_context can be found here: https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_thread_safe.c#L43 It basically does some calls to pthread.
 Can someone help on what to do next?
 EDIT: I looked into this a bit deeper. The problem actually does not seem to be the calls to pthread, but the way I read the rrd_context_t in Haskell (i.e. the peek). I changed my test to simply call the raw functions in C and look at the returned pointer address. That works ok and I do not get a null pointer. So I guess it has to be the peek which triggers the segmentation fault.
 This also happens when I simply call rrd_new_context which according to the C code ( https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_error.c#L121) only does a malloc and then returns the pointer.
 So either the memory pointed to is already taken away from my process (not sure what the proper wording is here) or my Storable instance is broken.

I've been trying to configure my init.el for org and org-roam, and I've gotten to where emacs starts without any error, I can open org-mode and I can open org-roam-mode. Then I'm stuck. Well, I did find that in org I can hit C-x C-f and open a *.org file and enter outline stuff, and save it, but I'm baffled by org-roam. Let's say I found some interesting ideas in the comment section of a blog in my browser. I assume that to record the note (zettel) I need to start emacs and get into org-roam-mode. What do I do then? I mean, what keys to I press to open a new note? How do I specify the type of note (main or reference, I'm starting out small)? Is there a tutorial anywhere that gives this kind of instruction for org-roam or zettelkasten?

 I'm currently moving my time tracking to org-mode after already using it for a few years.
 So far I've managed ok to transition/integrate org-mode in my caldav workflow.
 I found few problems that I have questions on:
  
I've used timestamps such as the one below in some entries however they don't seem to appear in my agenda buffer: <%%(and (diary-cyclic 14 31 3 2022) (diary-block 31 3 2022 30 3 2022)) 07:00-08:30> Is there anything that I need to do so that entries using those appear in my agenda?
 I've then tried to use something like `<2022-03-31 Do 07:00-08:00 UTC +2w> that works however if I include -1d to get a notification a day before they agenda doesn't show it for some reason.
 How does org-mode deal with timezones? I get some calendar invites that contain different timezones.

 https://github.com/gdelazzari/2048Solver
 It's one of the first working pieces of Haskell code I was able to write, and I'm sure it is written very naively. Keeping aside the obvious performance issues (which I'm not actually interested in solving at the moment), do you think there are ways I could improve it in terms of readability, program structure and use of the language features?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider the following megaparsec parsers:  ab = string "a" >> string "b" ac = string "ac"  I want to parse them consequently, maybe adding some modifier two the first one (??? ab >> ac) to achieve the following behavior:
  
ab should be optional
 if both parsers fail, expectations of both parsers should be shown (or, at least the first one)
  
I've tried the following:
  
optional ab >> ac
 try (optional ab) >> ac
 optional (try ab) >> ac
  
The first, as expected, is not able to parse "ac", the second behaves identically to the first. The third is much better, but it doesn't satisfy the second condition: for input "az" it returns "expecting 'ac'", but not "expecting 'ab' or 'ac'". It's interesting, that if the first symbol doesn't match (for example, for "z"), the desired behavior is achieved. However, this is not enough in my case. How can I do this?
 This is my test code: ``` parsers :: [Parser String] parsers = [ optional ab >> ac , try (optional ab) >> ac , optional (try ab) >> ac ] where ab = string "a" >> string "b" ac = string "ac"
 strs :: [String] strs = ["abac", "ac", "z", "az"]
 test :: IO () test = for_ (parsers zip [1 ..]) $ (p, i) -> do putStrLn $ "parser " <> show i <> ":" for_ strs $ \str -> do putStrLn $ "string "<> show str <> ":" parseTest p str ```
 P.S. I've tried to write my one combinator for this issue, using observing or setState/getState, but have not achieved anything.

 I'd prefer counters instead of using avy and playing game of pressing assigned letter. You can very quickly press C-s or C-r given number of times without making a mistake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to be able to actively recall my notes and review them on a regular basis, and I haven’t figured out how to implement them in my notes.
 I read Doubleloop’s blog post on his workflow, but as he stated in the improvement section,
  
I feel like I’m maintaining the flashcards separately from the body of my notes – it’s a bit of a duplication of effort. It’d be good to get a flow where the flashcard is just part of the note as is, and I can pull it out without duplicating it.
  
I tried to manipulate it a bit, and my current workflow is incorporating it directly into my notes.
 Take this note, for example, about Edge Devices,
 * Definition :PROPERTIES: :ANKI_DECK: Computer Networking :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic :ANKI_NOTE_ID: 1665541877624 :END: ** Front What are Edge Devices? ** Back - They are known as End-sytems or Hosts. These devices are divided into two groups: Clients and Servers. - These are the devices that recieves the internet as a service. *And, then here I continue with some more examples on the topic.* 
 And then I export it to Anki for reviewing.
 My question here is this a good workflow in the long run, as all my notes would take this shape?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So I use both ef-themes and modus-themes by Prots as my themes, and I really like the fact that we can customize the org-mode headings by level.
 This is done with this configuration (from ef-themes manual)
 (setq ef-themes-headings ; read the manual's entry or the doc string '((0 . (variable-pitch light 1.9)) (1 . (variable-pitch light 1.8)) (2 . (variable-pitch regular 1.7)) (3 . (variable-pitch regular 1.6)) (4 . (variable-pitch regular 1.5)) (5 . (variable-pitch 1.4)) ; absence of weight means `bold' (6 . (variable-pitch 1.3)) (7 . (variable-pitch 1.2)) (t . (variable-pitch 1.1)))) 
 As far as I understand, we can only configure 8 level, I thought that the last line would set the themes for every subsequent level, but this is not the case in my experience. When I create a ninth level heading, it goes back to the style of the first level.
 This make it weird and not really attractive with file with many levels of subheadings.
 ​
 I don't know if we can overcome this limitation, if so I would be interested in knowing how.
 My second thought was to disable the theming in a specific buffer. But I wasn't able to do it by making the variable local. Is there a way to do that ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Usually, one doesn't encounter new simple monads in the wild, they're nearly all combinations of existing transformers. But I don't know of an existing transformer capturing this:
 data RandomT m a = RandomT { getRandomT :: RandomSeed -> m a } split :: RandomSeed -> (RandomSeed, RandomSeed) instance Monad m => Monad (RandomT m) where RandomT action >>= f = RandomT $ \seed -> do let (seed', seed'') = split seed a <- action seed' getRandomT (f a) seed'' 
 On first glance, you'd say "wait, that's just a reader", but in fact it isn't because of the split function. This could be generalized with this type class:
 class CoSemigroup a where split :: a -> (a, a) 
 While there are no nontrivial comonoids in Haskell, could there be nontrivial semigroups (although I'm not sure whether random seeds are an example because of coassociativity)? If not, do random monads implemented this way actually obey the associativity laws?
 Is this transformer implemented in general somewhere?

 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("rd" "MyView" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 2) (org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Today" :time-grid t :date today :todo "TODAY" :scheduled today :order 1) (:discard (:anything t)) )))) (alltodo "" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "") (org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(deadline-up)) (org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Important" :property "urgent" :order 1) (:name "Überfällig" :deadline past :order 2) (:name "Heute fällig" :deadline today :order 3) (:name "Current Taks" :todo ("InProgress" "INPROGRESS") :order 4) (:name "Next ToDos" :todo ("InputQueue" "INPUTQUEUE") :order 5) (:name "Drafts" :todo "DRAFT" :order 6) )))))) ("inf" "InfAgenda" tags "filename={INFIT}"( (org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notregexp "\\* InProgress\\|\\* InputQueue\\|* Waiting\\|* DRAFT\\|* ToDo\\|* Backlog\\|* INPUTQUEUE\\|* INPROGRESS")) (org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(deadline-up)) (org-agenda-view-columns-initially t))) ("w" todo "Waiting") ("iq" todo "InputQueue") ("ip" todo "InProgress") ("d" todo "DRAFT") ("y" agenda*) )) 
 How can I get this to work automatically for the custom command "rd".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear All, I just got Emacs 28.1 installed on my work laptop. It's a windows 10 machine administered by the IT. The Emacs install does not have access to the internet - howerver, other programs like Firefox do.
 I download packages manually and use use-package without :ensure to configure them. I managed to configure a very basic system with ivy, swiper, evil (+collection). The main goal is convenient org-mode use.
 Do you have any tips for such an offline situation? I admit its quite a chore to do all the config and package installation manually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! This post isn’t just about vuiet but this is my main issue right now. Using spacemacs on pop! OS I recently decided to start adding some extended features and working on my config. Eventually I managed to get lastfm.el and Vuiet working together and it’s awesome! I think I’ve figured out how to make a script with new keybinds for the Vuiet stuff I need to use, but some features are broken, namely searching songs by lyrics. I’m not sure how to debug emacs scripts so if anyone has any suggestions, including a better player, I’m open. Also, I’m shopping around for a completion module, mostly for Python but also C and HTML.
 Edit:
 Vuiet is cool, but seems like a lost cause. I think the only functionality EMMS doesn’t have that Vuiet did, though, is searching by artist for stuff I don’t actually have. 
 My main problem at this point is how to add an SMB share to EMMS.

I recently interviewed with a job that ultimately passed me because I didn't have a ton of experience with Scala and they really wanted someone with hands on. 
 So my question is, how would you go about learning a bigger chunk of the language? I have started researching how to write a ray tracer and plan on doing that as a way to broaden my exposure to the language but besides that what else could I do to show I know my way around?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a bad dynamic in America's STEM education where kids going into college computer science out of high school hit a brick wall . . . largely made of math they've never seen before. In general, CS is not at all what they thought it would be. Then they switch/flunk out. So if higher-ed physics, engineering, math has a long, gentle preparatory on-ramp in K-12 with math, comp-sci has absolutely nothing -- or maybe just some "learn to code." And so I've been trying to put together a high-school-level on-ramp for real CS . And I'm basing it on Haskell. Why Haskell? Because the top-tier schools all do some sort of typed functional programming eventually. Functional seems to be the fault line between the top schools and the 2nd-tier. So for example I mix in discrete math with Haskell. You could say I'm high-school-izing the Doets, van Eijck text The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths, and Programming. Or even the Paulson ML for the Working Programmer, another fantastic book. Great, you might say. Trouble is I'm all alone -- as far as I know. For example, if you look at the AP Computer Science stuff, it's basically learn to program Java with a smattering of data structures and algorithms tacked on. Not really much help for a kid walking into Cornell or CMU. Every high school effort I've come across so far has hardly ever been more than "learn to code," typically Python. So my question to you is, should I keep going -- or give it up for a bad job? Am I really on to something, or am I tilting at windmills? The fact that I'm so alone on this is ominous. I've contacted lots of big name professors -- and they're sympathetic but in the long run apathetic simply because they're awash in 96th-percentile applicants. Yeah.... Your ideas would be appreciated.

Now, I want to use something like this where I can give the file paths as environment variable. I've been struggling but couldn't find anything related to this. Please help!
 Edit: Noting down the use case for this
 Let's assume we have a file in path - /home/user/dir1/dir2/file.txt
 I've set some env variable $TEST=/home/user/dir1
 In some other file (let's name it file2.f under dir2), I've mentioned following two lines:
 ../file.txt
 $TEST/dir2/file.txt
 With the "open-file-at-cursor" bind, I'm able to directly open a file.txt when my cursor is on 1st line. However, the same bind breaks down for line 2. I'm expecting both lines to open the same file. ffap does not solve my issue as it opens the final directory that holds my file(this will increase my keystrokes).
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody! Haskell caught my attention because of its powerful type system. I come from a math background so I thought it'd be fun to implement some theorems in abstract algebra in Haskell. From what I understand, there are classes of functions in Haskell like <> for example which represents an associative operation. What I'd really like is to implement a homomorphism type that sends f (x * y) to f(x) * f(y). The trouble I am having is that in mathematics we will always demand a proof that a map is a homomorphism before we give it its status as one. Is this not the case in Haskell? In other words, do we need to manually check that an operation is a homomorphism or is there some way for Haskell to recognize one (perhaps with a bit of assistance from the programmer/type system/something else)?

A NixOS system is defined by a configuration written in the Nix language.
The configuration sets various options and is evaluated into a build task for the system, which incorporates instructions for how to build, along with all the inputs they depend on.

 I want to create a database that keeps track of all people that have access to some data. The database is shared by a couple of organizations, sub groups of that organization and specific characters/addresses/people/user within that organization on one table.
 Traditionally I would just use a hashmap of some nature.. the hashmap could look up the user and we would know what organization they are apart of and we could easily remove that person from the organization access table.
 But if we have an organization of 10million addresses/users that seems like a bad idea.
 SO the alternative idea is to create a set theory or a list of rules and if the user is apart of the table.

 I ask because my keyboard kind of sucks and eats inputs sometimes, so the workflow gets jenk a bit. I would rather have some kind of checklist or small buffer that goes through each prompt than getting prompted by the mini buffer each time.
 Please let me know if this could be fixed by a package instead as well, thanks!

I'm only able to achieve word-level accuracy on reverse sync search. On forward sync search, the arrow that appears in the left-hand margin of the PDF preview buffer can be off by as much as a half-dozen lines.
 Is there a way to configure AucTeX + PDF Tools in order to highlight the word in the PDF Tools preview buffer corresponding to where the cursor is positioned in the AucTeX latex source buffer during a forward search instead of placing an arrow in the left-hand margin, which by construction can only be line-level accurate at best?

 I know about occur-rename-buffer but that gives only the buffer name not the regexp. When I run ibuffer I see this: *Occur: init.el* and *Occur: init.el*<2>. That's not very practical. Something like: *Occur: init.el*<defun> and *Occur: init.el*<global-set-key> would be much better.
 I've found this: rename-occur-buffer-term which it does display the regexp but not the buffer-name :/ I tried to put both together but my e-lisp knowledge is very, very limited atm. 
 Is anybody here already have a fix for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I wanted to take fs2 for a spin and try writing a simple generic connection/resource pool in it. The way I wanted it to work is:
  
The pool is instantiated lazily with no open connections
 Connections are acquired when requested
 Each connection is exposed as an fs2.Stream[IO, R] where R is the type of the connection
 Each connection is checked for error before release–if error, then dispose of the connection instead of releasing it back into the pool
 The connection pool as a whole is instantiated as a Resource[IO, ConnectionPool[R]] and all open connections are released when the pool is released
  
I would appreciate if anyone could take a look at my code and offer any thoughts/feedback/critiques.

 I've tried searching for a function/configuration that allows this to happen, but it doesn't seem to be a problem for other people, which suggests that there's something wrong with my configuration. I'm not using mpd yet, just a fairly standard setup.
 Below is my Emms config:

 For example: I'm using python and I want to use numpy and matplotlib. I don't want to copy the lib import everytime I do a block of code, so I create another block at the start of the file where I import my libs, and when I execute another block of code this one loads before.
 There's a way to do that, or I have to copy the imports everytime?

The speedbar can be a hassle to work with when I have emacs running fullscreen.
 My question really isn't different from this question that was asked six years ago:
 Speedbar in GUD - gdb debugger and watch expressions
 but there were no satisfactory answers then, and I'm wondering if that has changed at all. Are there any customizations or packages available that would let me monitor watch variables without requiring the speedbar?

 I'm using Emacs 28.2 on windows and Emacs 28.1 on Mac. Same issue on both.
 Spacemacs wants to install evil-escape, but it does not seem to exist.
 https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-escape (Claims the package exists in Melpa)
 https://melpa.org/#/?q=esca (this query shows evil-escape does NOT exist in Melpa)
 https://melpa.org/#/?q=evil (this query also fails to find evil-escape)
 So... what da heck? I hate to do this improperly but do I need to manually download evil-escape from github (first link) and stick it in the .emacs.d folder myself? Or is Melpa broken? Or spacemacs?

The only thing missing is a quick way to be able to pick from previous equations to reference, like how reftex does it for normal .tex editing. Is there perhaps some existing library that solves this problem?

 Ever wanted to write a function or command, but don't know what the functions for say manipulating buffers or getting file names are called?
 Version 28 of emacs introduced a new feature called shortdoc. It gives an overview over available elisp functions in a few select categories. Use the command M-x shortdoc-display-group and then type in which category you want to view and a buffer pops up giving you a brief overview.
 Give it a shot. Its great!

 I'm now getting to reading (and taking notes on) a number of publications in epub / pdf format mostly.
 I'd love to hear how everyone is dealing with references in books. My own (planned at this point) system would be to highlight passages in texts and paraphrase them in org-roam nodes.
 M-x highlight seems like the key here - is those highlights something I can reference from org-roam?
 bddean's ereader and nov.el look appealing, especially with nov-xwidget.el for formatting on the latter.
 Should I spend time exploring both of these, or am I missing the point?

 If you needed a canonical CVE reference for the library issue now you have one.

 Everywhere I edit text, I'd use the Vim keymap, it is already an extension of my mind in some way and I feel crampled when working without it.
 Lately, I've started building my Emacs config from scratch, to abstract myself from the computer I'm using and start gravitating towards using Emacs more as an OS rather than a code editor.
 I've been avoiding to use evil-mode and friends for two reasons:
  
I'd need to configure all the unimaginable keybindings to work properly with other packages (I'm aware of evil-collection though)
 I feel like the Emacs keybindings are designed like that in some way and that the part of the community that doesn't use evil works in the same level of efficiency or better due to tighter integration between packages.
  
My question would be: 
 Is it worth the effort I'm taking to learn the Emacs keybindings, or is it just "a different way of doing the same things"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy. It would be much easier for me to do my note-taking if org-roam-node-find had the following behavior: - Pressing TAB changes the text in the search bar to whatever the suggestion list has highlighted. I'd like it to just replace the entire thing instead of doing that default step-by-step completion if possible. - Pressing ENTER opens or creates the exact match of what's entered in the org-roam-node-find search bar. 
 Currently, I'm having some issues. My PKM note hierarchy uses dots as delimiters. Take the note res.lore.sw as an example (my note about Star Wars). I created it first. Now I want to create res.lore as an index for all the lores I've written about, but org-roam-node-find won't let me create it, because it matches with the Star Wars note and opens it. I'd instead like to be able to either press TAB to set the highlighted file as the new search, or press ENTER to open or create the exact note id entered into the search bar.
 My current org-roam config is pretty much the minimum:  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory "REDACTED") (org-roam-complete-everywhere t) (org-roam-capture-templates '(("d" "default" plain "%?" :if-new (file+head "${title}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n#+date: %U\n") :unnarrowed t))) :config (org-roam-setup) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode))

However, eglot does not seem to work well with either RMarkdown or Quarto documents as it hangs every time entering when enter a code chunk (up to 5 seconds or so). I am guessing it does this because it disconnects when entering the markdown mode and then needs to reconnect again. I am not sure. 
 I have two questions.
  
How might I be able to overcome this re-connection(?) issue with quarto or rmarkdown documents and still use eglot?
 Alternatively, how can I enable eglot just for *.r or *.R files and not just for ess-r-mode?

 (setq package-selected-packages '(use-package lsp-mode lsp-ui lsp-treemacs dap-mode company-mode flycheck prism aggressive-indent haskell-mode lsp-haskell)) 
 Then, I added this to my init.el (I use use-package):
 (use-package flycheck :init (global-flycheck-mode)) 
 However, even after doing that, when I open Emacs, I still get this error:
 Error (use-package): flycheck/:init: Symbol’s function definition is void: global-flycheck-mode
 It's strange, because even though I installed flycheck, the function seems to be undefined. The use-package configuration is what they recommend on their website, as well (scroll to find the use-package section), so I don't think the problem is calling (global-flycheck-mode).
 Does anyone have tips for what I should do next?

 I have a created a class called Task that contains SignalRef and then an instance from that class
 case class Task(id: String,, cancel: IO[SignallingRef[IO, Boolean]]) val task = Task(randomUUID().toString, SignallingRef[IO, Boolean](false)) 
 Thereafter, I put the task in a Map and calling it from two different streams.
 The first one is called from an HTTP request to set its value to “true”
  case DELETE -> Root / "tasks" / UUIDVar(taskId) => taskMap.get(taskId.toString) match { case Some(task) => for{ switch <- task.cancel _ <- switch.set(true).start >> IO.println("canceled") res <- Ok(task.toOutput.asJson) } yield res case None => NotFound("Not Found") 
 and the other one is called from a "stream.interruptWhen" to cancel the stream when the value become "true"
  val httpStream = for { cancelSwitch <- Stream.eval(task.cancel) httpStream <- client .stream(req) .flatMap(_.body) .through(decodeUsingHeaders[CsvRow[String]]()) .interruptWhen(cancelSwitch) .map(x => x.toMap) .map(x => x.asJson.noSpaces + "\n") .through(text.utf8.encode) .through(Files[IO].writeAll(Path(s"jsons/${task.id}.json"), Flags.Write)) } yield httpStream httpStream.compile.drain 
 And it appears that I am doing something wrong because they don't communicate with each other.
 P.S. I am Golang developer interested in the functional programming of Scala and its libraries CE3, FS2 and ZIO

Are there more abstract concepts in Haskell? Such as higher category theory and the Yoneda lemma. I've heard category theory be described as the linguistics of mathematics, so it only makes sense for it to have actually been used on a language.

I have new strategies for searching The Archive for prior zettel to link to new zettel. Surfacing matches have become increasingly difficult as the volume in the herd of zettel has grown, but I've developed a nifty strategy. I'll share soon.

 Note: I'm using Scala 2 in case that matter.
 lazy val sumVal: (Int, List[Int]) => Int = (acc, numbers) => numbers match { case head :: tail => sumVal(acc + head, tail) case _ => acc } def sum(acc: Int, numbers: List[Int]): Int = { numbers match { case head :: tail => sum(acc + head, tail) case _ => acc } } val numbers = List.fill(10000)(2) sum(0, numbers) // this works as expected sumVal(0, numbers) // this blows up with a stack overflow

 I use Doom Emacs with lsp enabled. 
 I develop in PHP using Laravel framework. There's a package called laravel-ide-helper that creates stub classes to help on IDE completion for properties and magic methods. 
 The problem is, when I x-ref-find I get two results, one for the correct method and another for the stub (they are all in a file called _ide_helper.php). 
 Is there a way I can filter out these results? Maybe blacklist the filename somehow?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I came across this stackoverflow post and tried to implement my own StateIO monad where I could perform IO actions. Here is my code:
 {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} import Control.Monad.Trans import Control.Monad (ap, liftM) newtype StateIO s a = StateIO {runStateIO :: s -> IO (a, s)} instance Functor (StateIO s) where fmap = liftM instance Applicative (StateIO s) where pure = return (<*>) = ap instance Monad (StateIO s) where return a = StateIO $ \s -> return (a, s) n >>= k = StateIO $ \s -> do (a, s') <- runStateIO n s runStateIO (k a) s instance MonadIO (StateIO s) where liftIO io = StateIO $ \st -> do x <- io return (x, st) class Monad m => MonadStateIO s m | m -> s where getSt :: m s putSt :: s -> m () instance MonadStateIO s (StateIO s) where getSt = StateIO $ \st -> return (st,st) putSt st = StateIO $ const $ return ((),st) 
 Then I run a simple program where the user inputs a positive integer n and I return the first n fibonacci numbers with the use of the StateIO monad. 
 type FibNums = [Int] main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "How many fibonacci numbers do you want to see:" n <- (read <$> getLine) :: IO Int let initialState = [n,0,1] process initialState process :: FibNums -> IO () process st = do (finished, newSt) <- runStateIO addFib st print finished -- for debugging print newSt -- for debugging if finished then do putStrLn "Fibonacci numbers are:" print $ tail newSt else process newSt addFib :: StateIO FibNums Bool addFib = do st <- getSt let newSt = st ++ [last st + last (init st)] finished = length (tail newSt) == head newSt liftIO $ print newSt -- for debugging putSt newSt return finished 
 The problem is in the function addFib the line "putSt newSt" does not really update the FibNums state variable and the initial state is returned. So the program loops on forever. 
 Any ideas what am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often find myself switching between Emacs and terminal (e.g. xterm). A typical example is to run a test suite after editing some code. For years, I've been looking for a clean way to send code directly to a terminal without copy-pasting, and I think I finally found it. Best hack I've come up with in 12 years of using this editor. Here it is:
  
Install the absolutely excellent vterm package:https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm
 Create the following script, put it somewhere reasonable:#!/bin/bashemacsclient -e "(progn (vterm) (vterm-send-string \"$*\") (vterm-send-return))"
 Install ob-tmux and configure:https://github.com/ahendriksen/ob-tmux(setq org-babel-tmux-terminal "<PATH TO THE BASH SCRIPT ABOVE>")(setq org-babel-tmux-terminal-opts nil)
 Enjoy!
 (e.t.a: with (setq vterm-enable-manipulate-selection-data-by-osc52 t) you also get integration between tmux visual mode and the kill-ring, which depending on your habits may be a more ergonomic way to copy/paste between terminal and emacs)

Also, when I use ctrl- mousescroll to zoom in the preview-pane, there is always a large margin to the left of the pdf page that I'd like to get rid of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 As part of a project at university, I'm looking to formalize and implement a small DSL for proving statements in first-order logic based on Fitch notation. I'm going to implement this in Haskell.
 The implementation itself would not be a huge problem if I were to go by intuition alone, seeing as natural deduction in first-order logic is quite simple. However, since this is a project for university, I wanted to ask if you guys can recommend some interesting papers on various techniques and approaches (e.g. dependent type theory) that might be of use to me?
 Thanks!

 For those who want to understand the theory behind dependent types I have written a paper which describes in a textbook style dependent types in its purest form encountered in the Calculus of Constructions.
 It is a paper for mathematically oriented readers.

 I am an emacs beginner and I am running into this annoying issue where pressing Control-Basckscpace brings up the help menu, which is the same as pressing Control-h. I want to remap C-Backspace to the function backward-kill word but keep C-h for help.
 Currently, I have M-Backspace mapped to backward-kill-word be default, but I do not want to get used to that one because I use C-Backspace outside of Emacs. What is the best solution here? I have looked online and did not find solutions that work exactly like I want. Some remapped C-h which is not what I want to do.
 I am using wsl 2 ubuntu if that matters at all.

 But i can't make it work with yasnippet, instructions are:

 (use-package yasnippet :ensure t :config (setq yas-snippet-dirs '(;; (substitute-in-file-name "${CFG}/Emacs/snippets/") ;; (lambda () (substitute-in-file-name "${CFG}/Emacs/snippets/")) ;; (concat (getenv "CFG") "/Emacs/snippets/") ;; (lambda () (concat (getenv "CFG") "/Emacs/snippets/")) "~/snippets/" ) ) (setq yas-indent-line 'fixed) (yas-global-mode 1) )

 For some reason, persp-mode isn’t loaded on initialization. What’s more interesting is it doesn’t load if I run persp-mode after Emacs is loaded, I have to execute persp-mode two times for it to work properly. Working properly for me means that C-c w prefix works.
 Any idea what I’m doing wrong?

 "type" can have a lot of values and in essence decides what "someObject" will be. I will omit moreFieldsAlwaysKnown for brevity. 
 I like typesafety so I naively thought I would encode this statically to make it users of my lib very difficult to create invalid values and track everything on the typelevel. In essence:

 I'm misunderstanding overrides/haskellPackages in some way. why is the code above not a no-op? It builds the world. (this is part of a larger investigation but i'm stuck on this question right now)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do a lot of FP in other languages and now need to add some functionality to a large Scala2 code base. I am in a situation like this
 class DoerOfStuff { def doItThisWay(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user: String): ResultType { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, TYPE_ARG_A, arg3, arg4, arg5) } def doItThatWay(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user: String): ResultType { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, TYPE_ARG_B, arg3, arg4, arg5) } def doItAnotherWay(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user: String): ResultType { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, TYPE_ARG_C, arg3, arg4, arg5) } } 
 Where helper and performCheck require the implicit user argument. Actually there's almost identical calls to more than one helper (and more than 5 params, don't get me started about that), but I think the pattern is clear.
 I'd like to refactor that into something like
 class DoerOffStuff { doIt(typeArg) { (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5) => { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, typeArg, arg3, arg4,arg5) } } val doItThisWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_A) val doItThatWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_B) val doItAnotherWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_C) } 
 I want to avoid having to type the argument list in the class definition, so I wanted to stick with val instead.
 Is there a way I can do that?
 I tried
 class DoerOffStuff { doIt(typeArg) { (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user) => { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, typeArg, arg3, arg4,arg5) } } val doItThisWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_A) val doItThatWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_B) val doItAnotherWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_C) } 
 but the the type checker will say "could not find implicit value for parameter user" for all places of ... = doIt(...)

 I have several common workflows which involve switching between buffers for files (that is, switching between buffers if the relevant file is already visited, or opening a new buffer visiting the file if not). There are generally two or three buffers or files in each group. I don't particularly need any new workflow tools for switching between groups, just between files within a group. What's important though is that these workflows are about switching between different types of file -- it would be very cumbersome to add all of the different pairs manually.

 Hi guys. I know this must be possible. But can you give me some examples in Haskell? Something like representing naturals and booleans with types, writing plus and if/else for them, etc.
 ​
 BTW, is Haskell's type inference engine Turing complete? I guess the answer is no. But why? Does UndecidableInstances have anything to do with this?
 ​
 Obviously, this question doesn't have a lot of practical value. It's a rabbit hole. Sorry for that. I'm just interested. And would be glad to hear from FP experts in our Reddit giving me some hints.

 Thanks all for your informative replies! I have had a busy day. Read your comments tomorrow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to write a website using yesod. The server needs some css and js files that I can include with juliusFile and luciusFile from the shakespeare library. If I add the files to extra-source-files in my cabal file the modules that need them even get automatically rebuild, when I change one of them.
 But I don’t want to write plain javascript or css. I‘d much rather write sass or typescript. So I need to compile those files so js or css if their source changes.
 Right now I use a custom build script with a custom buildHook that extracts the extra-source-files from the cabal file and builds them according to some build rules written in shake.
 How are bigger projects accomplishing this? Are they just using a makefile. Are they dropping cabal alltogether and only use shake? I know thats what GHC is doing, with their hadrian build system.
 I would love to hear of your experiences with different approaches! And yes I am procrastinating writing the thing I want to write really hard right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to write a function that has the definition shown in the title. A function is applied to the elements of the second argument (let's say a function that checks if an element is even). If any call of the function (among the whole list) returns nothing, then the whole funfunction should return nothing. Any insights on how I can set this up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks! My apologies if the title sounds vague, I'm looking for advice or project ideas to secure an introduction to frameworks such as Play,‍ Akka and Spark. and to how they are being used in real world applications. I have some background in Rust, so getting familiar with Scala was pretty straightforward. I'm loving the language a lot and how natural it feels. However, I would like to start building some hobby projects by using the aforementioned frameworks if possible, but I'm not really sure where to start, or which of them is more beginner-intermediate-friendly. May I ask; does anyone mind suggesting a learning roadmap or drop some project suggestions/ideas? I'd deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance. Stay safe and healthy everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A friend at an old workplace told me this morning that his boss told him they were all switching to VSCode and it was going to be a company mandate. It's not the first time I've heard people be dismissive of long time Emacs/Vim users. My last personal experience was someone telling me flat out I was wasting company time playing around with Emacs rather than using Pycharm.
 I have also gotten into long arguments that devolve into "feature-offs" where I have to explain how a feature VSCode has is also in Emacs. I tried to explain that you can use GDB in Emacs, and someone literally laughed at me because GDB is "ancient" and VSCode's debugging is modern and actually gets stuff done. It seems like even if Emacs can do something it's also A. Not good enough B. Takes too long to configure instead of just getting the job done.
 So please give me some advice on how I should combat this encroachment on my peaceful Emacs pasture. Or should I just give up my goats and switch to VSCode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 Im having a lot of fun taking my university (electronic engineering) notes in org-mode, using org-fragtog to toggle org-latex-preview and see math equations take life in real time.
 I'd really like to do the same thing with circuits, so I'm trying to use these tikz and circuitikz packages that let you draw circuits in latex.
 It compiles just fine, in fact when I export to pdf (SPC-m-e-l-o) the drawings are there.
 org-latex-preview also seem to try, very hard the first times I go over something, so my best guess is it's actually compiling and actually thinking it's showing it regularly, but no it doesn't. 
 Has someone had any similar experience? or any idea on how to move forward? 
 Thank you guys

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[im trying to convert given formula to an equivalent form, for negation and disjunctive normal form. i feel like i am at a good point but i have a lesser understanding of data types and structures in haskell that are limiting.
 here is how i defined the data type
 data Form = Var String | C Bool | Not Form | For :/\: Form | Form :\/: Form deriving (Eq, Show) 
 and then negation normal form
 nnf :: Form -> Form nnf (Var p) = Var p nnf (C p) = C p nnf (Not (Not p)) = nnf p nnf (p :/\: q) = nnf p :/\: nnf q nnf (p :\/: q) = nnf p :\/: nnf q nnf (Not (p :/\: q)) = (Not p) :\/: (Not q) nnf (Not (p :\/: q)) = (Not p) :/\: (Not q) nnf (Not p) = Not $ nnf p 
 and disjunctive normal form
 dnf :: Form -> Form dnf (Var s) = ((Var s)) dnf (p :\/: q) = (dnf p) :/\: (dnf q) dnf (p :/\: q) = undefined dnf (Not (Not p)) = dnf p dnf (Not (p :/\: q)) = (dnf $ Not p) :/\: (dnf $ Not q) dnf (Not (p :\/: q)) = undefined dnf (Not (Var s)) = Not (Var s) 
 i am struggling to get my dnf function to work properly or finding a correct approach. ive been using the nnf as reference for myself but any help/ suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Don’t worry (about writing Haskell), be happy (writing Agda instead)! by Jesper Cockx
As we all know, static type systems are great to ensure correctness of our programs. Sadly, in industry many people are forced to work in languages with a weak type system, such as Haskell.
Haskell and Visual Studio by Monday Morning Haskell
Most of the IDEs out there use graphical interfaces that let you use the mouse. Today we’ll explore one of those options - Visual Studio (aka VS Code).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was inspired by a question at the end of the Being lazy without being bloated presentation about the library nothunks, which asked if it was possible to do the same check statically.
 I managed to come up with a type class IsStrict which will give a type error if there is a non-strict field anywhere, at any depth, in the data structure given, explaining where the non-strict field is.
 Here it is in a gist: https://gist.github.com/anka-213/440cfef8c8712f5df747029640cfe170
 For example, if one were to ask if String is strict, it would give this error:  Found lazy field of type Char • In constructor: : • In type: [Char] • When checking strictness of: String Found lazy field of type [Char] • In constructor: : • In type: [Char] • When checking strictness of: String 
 It still works if we put the string inside some other data type, e.g. a strict pair ``` data StrictPair a b = P !a !b deriving Generic
 -- Non-strict type in strict field -- >>> nfStrict @(StrictPair Int String) -- Found lazy field of type Char -- • In constructor: : -- • In type: [Char] -- • In strict field of type [Char] -- • In constructor: P -- • In type: StrictPair Int String -- • When checking strictness of: StrictPair Int String -- ... ```
 This is of course more strict than checking nothunks, since you might have forced the data in some other way, so the data is thunk-free without having the data type be fully strict.

 I'm using a clean Emacs (v. 26) and have installed slime on it.
 I've got the following hello.cl and init.el
 https://gist.github.com/LucyJohnson-lua4life/e8c97bf931b7fd5795f5b9b22739c19d.
 I started "slime" and executed "slime-compile-and-load-file" on hello.cl, then i moved my cursor to the "some-function" symbol and executed "slime-who-calls". By now I would expect slime to show me the 3 other lines where "some-function" was executed but instead i got "No references found for some-function".
 Can somebody explain me how to fix this, or how to debug that?

I don't have a trash can folder on my system so its rather impossible to have moved it there by mistake. 
 Does emacs, or dired provide any sort of "history of moved files" or something similar that will help me find the file?

 the only thing i miss is being able to see the code actions available in the modeline and the project error list from flymake (not just the current buffer) in the modeline.
 It would be nice if there was a way to go to the previous/next error in project.
 anyone would know how to do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having recently been bitten by an unexpected failed Future, I was wondering if there is anything like a "safe" wrapper for Futures. Basically, the goal is to make concurrent API's inside an application not to have the hidden back-channel behaviour, yet still be composable in the usual way. A minimal implementation might be on the base Future to do a .transformWith(t => Future.successful(t.toEither)) and then return that or wrap in EitherT, maybe wrapping either of those result types.
 Would need to support stack-safe flatMap for Cats-effect. 
 Just speculating, thinking aloud here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I'm trying to wean myself off the actor model. I've grown used to thinking of systems as supervision trees. How to represent these trees without actors? E.g., let's imagine this tree structure is my app:
 - app: my app - scheduler: should wake up every quarter hour (0m, 15m, 30m, 45m) and perform a task - my_svc_pool: connection pool to a service that is called from within the scheduled task - my_svc: connection to my service - my_svc: another connection to my service 
 So let's say scheduler wakes up, tries to run its task by calling out to my_svc_pool, but the particular connection that it got routed to in the pool happened to get disconnected right before that. So the service call fails and scheduler blows up and goes away, leaving my app running without the 15-minute scheduled tasks that were supposed to happen.
 How would you structure an app with futures or tasks or any effect system (leaving aside actors) to supervise the system as a whole such that:
  
If a service connection in the connection pool happened to get disconnected and we just found out, my_svc_pool should safely dispose of it and replace it
 If scheduler blows up on waking up and trying to perform its task, app should replace it with a fresh one

In this post I will describe the approach that I’ve recently introduced in rules_haskell

Why even bother?
All software needs to be tested and verified, and Bazel rules are no exception. Some of them are
popular public libraries with a lot of projects depending on them, and they need a proper test set
to allow every contributor, frequent or occasional, to propose a change with little risk of breaking the
public API those rules represents. The same applies to the rules that live in huge monorepos growing every day,
where they often act as a glue between different components and can become complex, tricky and fragile.

 service:
  val fruits: Task[Seq[Fruit] = dao.allFruits def getFruits(): Task[Seq[Fruit]] = { val res = for { f <- fruits //f2 <- fruits // memoize would only help here } yield doSomethingWithFruits(fruits)

 I have tried running "indent-tabs-mode t", but that does nothing, which makes sense, because tabs are already enabled.
 The functionality I want is simple. Tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment. When I delete a tab, it deletes the tab. When I delete a space, it deletes the space.

 C:\Users\****\AppData\Local\Temp\ghc23648_0\ghc_5.c:8:61: error: warning: implicit declaration of function 'glfwInit' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration] 8 | HsInt32 ghczuwrapperZC1ZCmainZCMainZCglfwInit(void) {return glfwInit();} [...] 8 | HsInt32 ghczuwrapperZC1ZCmainZCMainZCglfwInit(void) {return glfwInit();} 
 I figured out how to add C libraries in package.yaml with extra-lib-dirs: and extra-libraries:. Unfortunately, when I browse the internet, the field it suggests for adding headers in Cabal, includes:, doesn't actually get recognized by Stack:
 C:\Users\****\Workspace\Testing\ffitest\package.yaml: Ignoring unrecognized field $.executables.ffitest-exe.includes 
 Just to be sure, I tried to use the same field in stack.yaml instead, just in case it would be recognized there. It causes the same error.
 What is the appropriate way to include C header files in a Stack project, assuming there is one?

 The task is rather simple: I want to convert a play from HTML to LaTex. The structure is simple so it could even be done with Regex, but I want a proper solution.
 I want to use pandoc to read and manipulate the text. And there I need your help to get started.
 I managed to cabal install pandoc but how to go on? I couldn’t install it with --lib, so how could I now import it to ghci to play around with it?
 I’m thankful for any hints and resources.

 Hi everyone,
 Today I finally decided to not just watch videos about Haskell but giving it a quick try to see how it works and feels.
 Since I just wanted to get a feel, I didn't want to start installing everything (especially because it was more than one step like downloading one file and installing it, lazy here) so I just went for the many Haskell browser consoles (replit for example) and I just couldn't do anything that I see in the many YouTube tutorials because of this "main =" thingy. I then tried with a "main = do" and writing under it but nothing works as in the tutorial, example "sumOfNums = [1..1000]" among many others.
 What can I do if I want to just play around, test basic functions etc in a browser ? It seems that I am supposed to already know some level of coding architecture and in every basic tutorial I watched there isn't any mention of such main = ...
 It's puzzling me how incredibly complicated this simple beginner step seems to be when comparing to, say, groovy web console, in which you can just type things, functions, classes etc...
 Thanks guys !

 Is there any way to list the nearest header above a TODO item in agenda view, in addition to the file name? I’m thinking of those cases where a file may have several projects broken out under different headers like this:

 It’d be great if agenda showed:

 Instead of just:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The transient package has a macro transient-define-prefix (docs). The following defines a complete prefix:
 (setq l1 '(("vl" "visual lines" visual-line-mode))) (transient-define-prefix foo1 () "docstring" [:pad-keys t ["Appearance" l1]]) 
 (The macro allows for a list of "elements" like l1 to be interpolated, something like a ,@ splice in a backtick context.)
 But having the variable l1 lying around feels like a loose end. The following approach looks better:
 (let ((l2 '(("vl" "visual lines" visual-line-mode)))) (transient-define-prefix foo2 () "docstring" [:pad-keys t ["Appearance" l2]])) 
 But it fails with "Symbol’s value as variable is void: l2"
 My understanding of elisp scope is clearly lacking.
 Is the problem that the transient-define-prefix macro is expanded within the let scope but the result is not evaluated until after the let scope is discarded? The elisp documentation for macros says that "[t]he Lisp interpreter proceeds to evaluate the expansion as soon as it comes back from the macro" but I may be misunderstanding this.

 cyclicIndex :: [a] -> Int -> a -- cyclicIndex is total in its second argument -- provided its first argument is total and not infinite cyclicIndex xs i = xs !! (i mod N) where N = length xs i mod N = unique representative of NZ+i in [0..N) 
 My attempt is
 cyclicIndex :: [a] -> Int -> a cyclicIndex xs i = if i >= 0 then (cycle xs) !! i else (cycle (reverse xs)) !! (-1-i) 
 This seems to work, and the function is a simple enough function, but I am having trouble reasoning about its correctness from my specification. My attempts at calculating its correctness runs into confusion about mod in Haskell and mod in maths. In particular, I noted down the laws
  
cycle xs !! i = xs !! (mod n i) for i >= 0 (note the mod is Haskell's mod)
 reverse xs !! i = xs !! (N - 1 - i) for i in [0..N)
 cycle . reverse = reverse . cycle? (A free theorem? Useful?)
  
How might we approach this correctness problem?

 I want to run emacs inside a development container (as I'm using Fedora Silverblue), but I'm having a weird issue:
 My config files are all in ~/.config/emacs/, but just after the launch of the container (distrobox-enter), emacs creates ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d and ignores the config folder.
 If I stop emacs, delete ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d and restart emacs, my init.el in ~/.config/emacs/ is considered and emacs starts configured the proper way.
 For now I think I will just move my config folder, but if you think this is an issue I might need to report on the mailing list, or if you can help me investigate a bit more, feel free to help me!

 #+BEGIN_SRC python :var a=localtable b=folder/my-file:externaltable :results value table :return rtn import scripts.myscript as ms rtn = ms.myfunction(b) #+END_SRC 
 any time i evaluate the code block passing variable b into function (it's external file's table) it puts that external file top into buffer-flip (as if i just switched from that external file).
 example say i flip between buffer1 (where above code block is) and buffer 2 (buffer1 > buffer2 > buffer 1 > buffer 2, etc), but when i evaluate the code buffer flip becomes (buffer 1 > external file > buffer 1 > eternal file)
 if i evalute the code passing variable a into function (local table) - buffer flip works correctly.
 I am not sure that's buffer flip's package problem that's why i am asking here first - maybe i am missing some emacs / org-mode setting?

I've got a lot of my config working already, but I don't get how to do external package-management at all. My config is littered with :ensure-system-package statements that all fail. I've installed Debian subsystem and also mingw, but I don't get how I can tie either of them in. I have found a few blog-posts about Emacs on Windows, but those were more about trivial things that I were able to figure out on my own.
 So. 1) Does the concept of PATH exist on Windows? \ 1.1) Can the PATH be changed to include something either from mingw or Debian subsystem?
 Looks like starting up the subsystem takes some time, so I'm also worried about performance. \ 2) Should I be going about this in another way entirely?

I was having a conversation one day and I couldn’t recall the name of a term, something I learned from a YouTube video. That bothered me. After the chat I went back to YouTube, found the video, and started searching through it. I increased the playback speed and went back and forth but still couldn’t find it. After a few minutes of that struggle, I thought: “what the heck am I doing?”. Then I wrote a tiny elisp function to extract subtitles. While reading through the subs I realized how much good stuff went past my ears (while watching the video).
  
It's tiny and very simple, but I think can be used already.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm trying to disable evil-mode in doom emacs because I don't know vim keybindings beyond hjkl, :wq, :e, and switching between modes. Although this is enough to do basic editing, I would like to learn emacs "the emacs way", as I'm not a vimmer. I'm just using doom emacs as a crutch while I get comfortable with emacs and lisp.
 ​
 Anyway, I've tried the following:
 comment out (evil +everywhere) with two semi colons in "~/.doom.d/init.el"
 ran doom sync
 added (package! evil-mode :disable t) to "packages.el"
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 deleted (evil +everywhere) from "init.el" completely
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 removed +bindings from :config default in "init.el"
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 ​
 I'm not sure what else I should try.
 ​
 EDIT: rebooted my machine and evil is no more. Not sure at which point I could/should have rebooted but here we are.

 In vim, I currently have it set up so that when a line soft wraps, it will be indented by one tab width compared to the first line, as seen here: https://imgur.com/X6GTuaL
 In emacs, I have visual-line-mode and org-indent-mode enabled, which makes the soft wrapped lines flush with the first line (seen here: https://imgur.com/4xfBZnJ). I searched through google and any settings I could think of, but cannot find a way to indent the wrapped lines in emacs the same was as it is in vim.
 Is there a setting I'm missing, or a package that will do this for me? If not, is this something that could be done in lisp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've encountered a design issue several times, and I'm wondering what approach is most consistent with Haskell idioms/best practices.
 I'm implementing a data structure, call it Z a, with an interface for manipulating it where almost all of the functions in the interface return a Z a, with many of the form Z a -> Z a or b -> Z a -> Z a. But for a few of the functions there's no valid result for some edge case inputs, and it makes sense in those situations to return Maybe (Z a). 
 Now at that point, it makes sense to have every function in the interface return Maybe (Z a) because I can then sequence my operations nicely with >>= 
 z :: Z a z >>= op1 >>= op2 >>= (op3 x) >>= (op4 1 2) 
 or something like
 pipe :: (Foldable t, Monad m) => a -> t (a -> m a) -> m a pipe = foldM (&) z :: Z a pipe z [op1, op2, op3 x, op4 1 2] 
 This is pretty convenient, I suppose, but then just one or two operations that have a Maybe result changed the entire interface to the data structure. An alternative would be to make the data structure itself an instance of Monad and make everything again -> Z a. There are several advantages of internalizing, e.g., I can carry some extra information in the Nothing case or even have several failure paths; and several disadvantages -- the non maybe'd functions now have to do the boilerplate to check for the Nothing-ish inputs and pass them along for every function, whereas Maybe does that automatically.
 My question is what are the Haskell best practices/idioms for this decision. Where is the boundary for the choice between internalizing the Monad instance in the data structure type itself and just using something like Maybe for *all* the functions in the interface. 
 I hope my question is clear. Thanks for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Lately, I've been defining my own regular expressions for parsing errors in the *compilation* buffers by adding entries to the compilation-error-regexp-alist and compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variables. However, there's a problem. This list already contains an enormous amount of regular expressions for all kinds of languages that I don't use, however, these regular expressions also match errors of the language that I'm trying to add support to, and this results in extracting incorrect paths to files containing errors. I've set compilation-error-regexp-alist to nil and the problem disappeared, but now when I byte-compile elisp files, I get no way to jump to problems from the compilation buffer (well, duh, the regexp list now doesn't contain an entry for elisp).
 So this creates a problem. I want my regular expressions to be the only ones present in the list when I'm working on a project in this language, and I want other regexps to be available when I'm working on other projects. I've thought about using dir-locals.el but my regexps use functions to get the file out of the error message, and I can't put that into dir-locals reliably.
 Another problem is that the compilation-error-regexp-alist contains names of the languages it supports, but for example, there's no elisp or emacs-lisp entry, yet the byte-compile warnings are highlighted correctly. And there's no way to see what regular expressions are responsible for the matches in the compilation buffer, so it's hard to debug what's overriding mine.
 TL;DR: Ideally, I want compilation-error-regexp-alist to be configurable per project but I use custom functions that can break other people's configurations who work on the same project as me and load dir-locals.el

 Does anyone have a hack that does this? I know that the project is essentially unmaintained at this point, but hopefully there's someone in the community who knows.

 file.cpp has a function

 When I do xref-find-definition for type_t, it simply shows me the "struct type_t *t1" in the file above.
 type_t is defined in another header, which this file includes. Why can't eglot/xref jump to the definition in the file that defines type_t? lsp-mode, there's no issue at all. (I am compiling my code with bear to get a compile_commands.json file).

 It would take quite a bit of time (we are talking 0.3s but enough to be annoying) to exit the normal mode when inside a tmux session. It would then do some crazy things too between those 0.3s if I start typing some letters...
 I discovered this spacemacs issue and buried in the comments this tmux setting : 
 set -s escape-time 0 
 which works exactly as intended and give you an exit to normal mode straight away...
 so if anyone else has this issue and find this post then I guess you are welcome internet stranger :)

 Does it have anything similar for reading E-mail?
 Most modes that I know of are part of another package (like Gnus or Wanderlust or Mew, etc.) but lets imagine I've fetched my E-mail via some other means; home-grown, if you will.
 I, now, want to read them but I don't want to roll my own mode to do so; repurposing another package's for this purpose would probably likewise be fine so long as it could be isolated from the rest of the package (e.g. mh-show? But we'd want to avoid accidentally triggering mh-rmail while using mh-show, for example).
 I can't seem to find a Mail mode equivalent but for reading mail, instead of sending.

 I choose the most recent one:

 It's internals show, that there are 3 files (2 of them are important *.pl):

 Then I do C-c C-c and it openes only the 1st file from the list 00.cookbook.pl, then it recovers it from #00.cookbook.pl# and stops recovering session. It doesn't open neither the 00.lwp.proxy.pl, nor the older session file, that was previously open.

 My reasons. Sometimes I need to move things around, align, or split to have a clearer structure. AUCTeX does not seem to respond well for that kind of manual writing and neglect all the work after hitting TAB or ENTER.
 I used to work with Atom, in which idea about indentation was very simple: when I decided to move cursor two extra tabs to the right, all following lines would hold on that indentation until I'd changed it. This helped me to structure long equations to see them better.
 I hope whatever I wrote make sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working through this blog post on building a simple interpreter, which uses the type Expr Value to describe an expression which evaluates to a value, and Expr (Value -> Value) to describe an expression which evaluates to a function. 
 Now, the type constructor Expr has kind *->* by default, which I think is too general. I see no situation when we would put anything other than functions involving Value into it, and I think it could count as a programmer error if there was a value Expr a, where a is not in F, where F ::= Value | F -> F.
 Questions:
  
Is there a way to enforce this constraint in Haskell, e.g. using type families?
 Is there a nice way to describe F in Haskell?
  
One additional challenge is that data Expr a = ClosedExpr a | OpenExpr Name (Expr (Value -> a)) has useful functor and applicative instances, which I hope can remain.

This will be the next paper I will process. It is highly relevant for the next material for the Zettelkasten Method. Right now, I am processing the application to physics which is also a nice read.
To me, the key learning for the Zettelkasten Method is the heavy emphasis on decision making. I can't express it precise enough to communicate it nicely. But there is a striking similarity to learning the Zettelkasten Method. Right now, many people try to learn it as if they learn something from a textbook. It feels rather "formulaic". But it is important to get a feel for the implicit decisions you make through your actions. Yes, there are principles and good practices.

Specifically, the pain points with TRAMP shows up mostly in dired and magit, where the turnaround speed (time spent to open a folder in dired, or time spend in any magit command) is quite high. I suspect this is due to the underlying process that TRAMP uses to connect to my remote server. My remote connection is relatively fast (100Mbps+). Things that I have tried till now are:
  
For my remote server, set the following flags in .ssh/config such that TRAMP re-uses the connections
  
 Host myfasthost ... Compression yes ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p ControlMaster auto ControlPersist 90m 
  
I use scp protocol to connect to TRAMP in dired. For example, to open a remote folder /path/to/my/folder, I use the following:
  
 /scp:myfasthost:/path/to/my/folder 
 Is there any other protocols I can use to ensure faster connections? Or any other tips/hacks to improve the TRAMP dired+magit experience? TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am about to start a new project in Haskell, model checking with (new) tree-like data structures. I think it is best to start building on a library such that i can already have elegant base functions, yet i am wondering what library is currently the standard? I read about fgl ( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl ), yet it is a very old library. 
 It is a proof-of-concept project, thus i would like to do this in Haskell (clean mathematical code + modularity) instead of a lower level language (C++, C).
 In my project i will need: 
  
memoization (during a recursive depth-first traversal)
 
labelled edges
 
nodes have values corresponding to a ordinal indicating their level.
 
some special nodes which transform my traversal function's interpretation.
 
labelled leaf nodes
 
 Any recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After trying to refresh my email setup, I ended up mistakenly (i.e. deliberately, but without considering the consequence) updating mu and mu4e. I was on version 1.5.5, and I've ended up on 1.8.9.
 This upgrade does seem to break a lot of my little tweaks to mu4e. I've managed to sort a few of these out, e.g. mu4e~proc-remove-id becomes mu4e--server-remove-id, mu4e~mark-check-target becomes mu4e--mark-check-target .
 But there are still a few bugs. I previously stole a function to convert an email to a .pdf file:
 (defun mu4e-action-open-to-pdf (msg) (let* ((date (mu4e-message-field msg :date)) (infile (mu4e~write-body-to-html msg)) (outfile (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d%H%M%S.pdf" date))) (with-temp-buffer (shell-command (format "wkhtmltopdf %s ~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s" infile outfile) t)) (interactive) (find-file (format "~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s" outfile) ) )) 
 Now mu4e~write-body-html is no longer defined.
 My questions are:
  
Is there a replacement for mu4e~write-body-html? Or a different method to convert a message to pdf?
 
I've tried to follow the release notes here, but find it hard to follow... for instance, the releases jump from 1.4.15 to 1.6.0? (So where is 1.5.5?) Is there a compilation of all these changes from e.g. ~ to -- and other general refactoring?
 
 EDIT:
 Just found this warning in the documentation:
 The whole of mu4e consists of hundreds of elisp functions. However, the majority of those are for internal use only; you can recognize them easily, because they all start with mu4e~ or mu4e--. These functions make all kinds of assumptions, and they are subject to change, and should therefore not be used. 
 which explains the instability. Didn't see this/know enough about elisp when I stole the functions. Fair enough.

Undoubtedly the worst binding I’ve had to deal with is C-x on emacs. I took the suggestion from the emacswiki and swapped C-u and C-x. I barely use C-u anyway, and this places C-x right under the pointer in the home row, which is very comfortable. Common sequences like C-x C-s and C-x C-e become optimal homerow rolls.
  
I was wondering how to do that natively in emacs without using karabiner/xmodmap or other OS dependent solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announcing the posit-3.2 library, where Real numbers are approximated by Maybe Rational. The Posit type is mapped to a 2's complement integer type; smoothly and with tapering precision, in a similar way to the projective real line.
 The implementation includes word sizes from 8 to 256 bits.
 The library is implemented with several Haskell Language extensions:
 {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} -- For our main type Posit (es :: ES) {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} -- For our ES kind and the constructors Z, I, II, III, IV, V for exponent size type {-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-} -- For defining the type of kind ES that indexes the GADT {-# LANGUAGE ViewPatterns #-} -- To decode the posit in the pattern {-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-} -- Added Strictness for some fixed point algorithms {-# LANGUAGE PatternSynonyms #-} -- for a nice NaR interface {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} -- To make instances for each specific type from Posit8 to Posit256 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-} -- Allow non-type variables in the constraints {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-} -- To apply types: with '@', it seems to select the specific class instance {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} -- To convert between Posit Types {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} -- To reduce some code duplication {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-} -- To reduce some code duplication, I think the code is decidable but GHC is not smart enough ;) 
 The one area that I think Haskell or my understanding of Haskell can improve is with some code duplication in the internal 'PositC' class. It would be neat to be able to make default implementations of class functions that are polymorphic over an associated type.
 Enjoy!

 Math templates don't work in cdlatex mode - for example when I have $fr$ (or fr in \begin{math}...\end{math}) and press tab when the cursor is after r, it doesn't expand to \frac{}{}.
 I tried this in both org-cdlatex-mode and .tex files. Things marked as TEXT or TEXT/MATH in org-cdlatex-command-help work, the ones marked as MATH don't - pressing tab just moves the cursor out of the math environment
 What's wrong?
 Edit: solved by installing auctex

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use the builtin completion at point in eshell to complete command arguments. E.g in eshell I'd type cd and hit <TAB>:
 ~ $ cd 
 to open up the *Completions* buffer. Im currently using emacs 29.0.50 (commit 72c64dd73c), and so M-<down> and M-<up> can cycle through the completions (directories in this case with the cd command), while keeping the eshell buffer focused. The problem I'm facing now is how to actually insert the currently highlighted completion into my eshell buffer. Clicking on the completion with the mouse will insert it into eshell, as well as switching focus to the *Completions* buffer and hitting RET over it, but I'm trying to do this without having to switch focus from eshell. M-<up> and M-<down>, added new in emacs 29, allow cycling through completions while keeping focus in the current window (my eshell in this case), but I cant select one. The command minibuffer-choose-completion, which is bound to M-RET returns an error saying "Text is read only", which I think is happening because it is trying to insert the completion into the minibuffer and not my eshell window. Moreover, completion-at-point for symbols in elisp files works as intended with M-RET, but not for eshell. Any help on how to sort this would be great. Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running the following R code in a code block in org-mode.
 #+begin_src R :session :results output latex :exports results library(ggplot2) library(xtable) x <- rnorm(1000) g0 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(x), aes(x)) + geom_histogram(); g0 hist_dat <- ggplot_build(g0)$data[[1]] hist_dat <- hist_dat |> select(xmin, xmax, count) print(xtable(hist_dat, digits = c(0, 1, 1, 0)), include.rownames = FALSE) #+end_src 
 This creates the expected LaTeX code:
 \begin{table}[ht] \centering \begin{tabular}{rrr} \hline xmin & xmax & count \\ \hline -3.3 & -3.1 & 1 \\ -3.1 & -2.9 & 1 \\ -2.9 & -2.6 & 0 \\ -2.6 & -2.4 & 5 \\ -2.4 & -2.2 & 7 \\ -2.2 & -1.9 & 14 \\ -1.9 & -1.7 & 11 \\ -1.7 & -1.5 & 20 \\ -1.5 & -1.3 & 35 \\ -1.3 & -1.0 & 49 \\ -1.0 & -0.8 & 64 \\ -0.8 & -0.6 & 67 \\ -0.6 & -0.3 & 108 \\ -0.3 & -0.1 & 90 \\ -0.1 & 0.1 & 98 \\ 0.1 & 0.3 & 85 \\ 0.3 & 0.6 & 84 \\ 0.6 & 0.8 & 62 \\ 0.8 & 1.0 & 59 \\ 1.0 & 1.3 & 35 \\ 1.3 & 1.5 & 32 \\ 1.5 & 1.7 & 22 \\ 1.7 & 1.9 & 25 \\ 1.9 & 2.2 & 13 \\ 2.2 & 2.4 & 10 \\ 2.4 & 2.6 & 1 \\ 2.6 & 2.9 & 1 \\ 2.9 & 3.1 & 0 \\ 3.1 & 3.3 & 0 \\ 3.3 & 3.6 & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular} \end{table} 
 However, when I run org-export-dispatch and select export to LaTeX and As PDF file and open, I get nothing in the PDF (neither code nor the results). I wonder what I'm doing wrong.

 I've been using orderless with some custom dispatchers for a while now, but I've always felt like something was wrong or too complex when using the OR operator (regex: \(pattern1\|pattern2\)).
 So today I invested half a hour into learn basics of Elisp string operations and have created my own dispatcher for that.
 (defun or-regexp (pattern index _total) (cond ((string-suffix-p "|" pattern) `(orderless-regexp . ,(concat "\\(" (concat (s-replace "|" "\\|" (substring pattern 0 -1)) "\\)")))) ((string-match-p "|" pattern) `(orderless-regexp . ,(concat "\\(" (concat (s-replace "|" "\\|" pattern) "\\)")))))) 
 I assume it's not the prettiest code, but it's enough for me

Wright Mills talks about his methods for note taking, thinking, and analysis in what he calls "sociological imagination". This is a sociologists' framing of their own research and analysis practice and thus bears a sociological related name. While he talks more about the thinking, outlining, and writing process rather than the mechanical portion of how he takes notes or what he uses, he's extending significantly on the ideas and methods that Sönke Ahrens describes in How to Take Smart Notes (2017), though obviously he's doing it 65 years earlier.

 Now I'd like to pre-compile all the eln files ahead of time, so emacs does not compile the files every time the container spins up again.
 Native compile after startup
 I have set EMACSNATIVELOADPATH which seems to avoid that doom generates eln files in the tmp directory.
 I have set
 (setq native-comp-eln-load-path '("/home/emre/local/lib/emacs/28.2/native-lisp/")) 
 I have tried stuff like
 emacs --debug-init -q --no-site-file --batch --eval "(progn (load \"/home/emre/.emacs.d/early-init.el\") (require 'doom) (require 'doom-lib) (require 'doom-start) (setq package-native-compile t) (setq native-comp-async-jobs-number 8) (setq comp-deferred-compilation nil) (byte-force-recompile \"/home/emre/local/share/emacs/28.2\") (native-compile-async \"/home/emre/local/share/emacs/28.2\" t) (while (or comp-files-queue (> (comp-async-runnings) 0)) (progn (message \"Items left to compile %s\" (length comp-files-queue)) (sleep-for 1))) (kill-emacs))" 
 Which doesn't seem to work either ... 
 Has anyone an idea how I can achieve pre-compiling all eln files, that are shown in the output window?

 I copy text (outside of emacs) that can be one of these lines:
 57,655 45,049 45,363 (57,655) (45,049) (45,363) 57,655) (45,049) (45,363 57,655 45,049 45,363 $ 57,655 $ 45,049 $ 45,363 
 (amount of spaces/tabs can very, and number of elements is 3 most of the time, sometimes two)
 And need to paste it either as
 57,655|45,049|45,363 
 Or as
 (57,655)|(45,049)|(45,363) 
 (basically ignore everything except digits and "," and separate elements with "|")
 As i understand i need to create 2 custom paste functions (one regular, one with "()"s) taking original paste function as basis. I found the pasting function (via c-h k):
 (defun cua-paste (arg) "Paste last cut or copied region or rectangle. An active region is deleted before executing the command. With numeric prefix arg, paste from register 0-9 instead. If global mark is active, copy from register or one character." (interactive "P") (setq arg (cua--prefix-arg arg)) (let ((regtxt (and cua--register (get-register cua--register))) (count (prefix-numeric-value arg))) (cond ((and cua--register (not regtxt)) (message "Nothing in register %c" cua--register)) (cua--global-mark-active (if regtxt (cua--insert-at-global-mark regtxt) (when (not (eobp)) (cua--insert-at-global-mark (filter-buffer-substring (point) (+ (point) count))) (forward-char count)))) (buffer-read-only (error "Cannot paste into a read-only buffer")) (t (cond (regtxt (cond ;; This being a cons implies cua-rect is loaded? ((consp regtxt) (cua--insert-rectangle regtxt)) ((stringp regtxt) (insert-for-yank regtxt)) (t (message "Unknown data in register %c" cua--register)))) ((memq this-original-command '(clipboard-yank x-clipboard-yank)) (funcall this-original-command)) (t (yank arg))))))) 
 and as i understand i need to modify "arg" before doing "yank arg", but i have not idea how this "modification" should look like :) Could someone please help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[… would it be possible to implement it?
 I’m thinking of the lambda calculus as purely functional language with only anonymous functions. We could introduce recursion with the Y-combinator (λf. (λx. f (x x)) (λx. f (x x)). In the Haskell idiom it would be: (\f -> (\x -> f (x x)) (\x -> f (x x)) which will give us an error because of Haskell’s type system. 
  • Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: t0 ~ t0 -> t • In the first argument of ‘x2’, namely ‘x2’ In the first argument of ‘f’, namely ‘(x2 x2)’ In the expression: f (x2 x2) • Relevant bindings include x2 :: t0 -> t (bound at <interactive>:19:40) f :: t -> t (bound at <interactive>:19:12) y :: (t -> t) -> t (bound at <interactive>:19:5) 
 Is there any other way we could introduce recursion to Haskell if it wasn’t there already?

It demands the .so module requires recompilation at the drop of a hat. For some reason trying to run vterm after restarting Emacs requires it to be recompiled. It is as if the module itself is missing or Doom detects that some related source files have changed.
 
The vterm windows don't have modelines or titles around them and that makes it hard to tell them apart when they are split. Is there some way to set these?

 This year, I'm participating in Hacktoberfest as a mentor and maintainer. And I'm happy to offer my mentorship in the following two projects:
  
Haskell Beginners 2022 — a Haskell course for complete beginners. It doesn't require any prior FP knowledge at all! And it's format is perfectly suitable for Hacktoberfest. Read more information in how to participate instructions.
 Iris — a Haskell CLI framework I created earlier this year. It's still at the early stage. But it has tons of beginner-friendly issues! Check out issues with the "hacktoberfest" label.
  
Feel free to ask any questions!
 Also, please, don't hesitate to share your projects that participate in Hacktoberfest this year as well! 🤗

 Emacs usually opens the third window with a horizontal split, and I hate that. Say a daily note in org-roam. I would like to tell emacs there should always be two windows, opened side-by-side, not three, not one, no horizontal split. How do I do that?

 ​
 The readme does not specify this, but the Code itself seems fairly small, i tried understanding it (its hard for me to understand), it seems it mentions something about arguments input, and as specified by "man pdf2svg" i should be able to supply page number as argument so i tried doing:
 ```

 +NAME: fig:l1p2
 +ARGUMENTS: 2
 [[./01_Introduction.pdf]] ```
 with no luck, hopefully a clever guy here knows how i can do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello every one,
 I didn’t pay attention until recently, but I keep seeing the following warning while byte-compiling my preference files:
  Warning: ‘string-as-unibyte’ is an obsolete function (as of 26.1); use ‘encode-coding-string’. 
 I use the following code to convert arbitrary text (usually utf-8, but may be something else):
  (base64-encode-string (string-as-unibyte (buffer-string)) 'no-line-break) 
 I did look at the encode-coding-string, but what bother me is that it seems that I’m obliged to set the original coding-system. But in my case it can change from time to time.
 Is there a way to keep the same "magical" behavior of string-as-unibyte function, with which I didn’t have to assume a possibly wrong source coding system? Am I correct if I say it’d be the undecided coding system? As in:
  (base64-encode-string (encode-coding-string (buffer-string) 'undecided) 'no-line-break) 
 As I’m reading the whole buffer content, is there a (local) variable holding the current buffer coding system?
 Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, my company Mercury is hosting a Haskell meetup on October 20th, 2022 at 6 PM in downtown Portland. If you're interested in giving a talk, we have slots for 25 minute and 5 minute talks. Talks already planned include:
 ​
 Practical STM: An Async Job Queue, by Jake Keuhlen
 ​
  
In this talk, we’ll walk through a brief introduction to concurrency and one of Haskell’s best tools for dealing with it: software transactional memory (STM). We’ll then use STM to build a simple but powerful asynchronous job queue.
  
Make your own Haskell, by Mitchell Vitez
 ​
  
We'll explore the process of making our own Haskell-like language. Composition will lead us to trees, and trees will lead us to languages. We'll grow, trim, typecheck, and reorganize these trees, populating our own little forested enclave. Finally, we'll discover why our language can't really be represented by a tree after all.
  
​
 We'll have pizza delivered and the event will be bartended.
 The event is at the Power + Light Building, at 920 Southwest 6th Avenue.
 Please RSVP here if you're interested: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/haskell-talks-at-mercury-tickets-424633328717. Note: You must RSVP through Eventbrite for building security to let you in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been a Dynalist user for years, as my notes tend to follow a hierarchy, but I’m wanting to transition to org-mode for obvious reasons. When you search a page in Dynalist, you get search results in the context of each parent line ("parent" as determined by indentation level). The same goal is accomplished in ogrep.
 Is this type of search possible in emacs? In org-mode, I know there is sparse-tree, but it is not as "sparse" as ogrep or Dynalist, giving much more context than I sometimes need. This feature is so valuable to me that I'll have to craft a solution with your suggestions if one doesn’t yet exist.

 When I have: alias mv eshell/mv --interactive --verbose $1 $2 it works for moving a single file but obviously fails when I'm trying to do mv foo1 foo2 foo3 bar/ (same story for cp). 
 So the question is: how can I use the Eshell version of mv/cp with an alias in the Eshell alias file?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem with updating, upgrading and syncing Doom profiles is that you need to ensure that the ~/.doom.d and the path to bin/doom for the profiles do not conflict in your shell and I had to do some experimentation using ~/.emacs-profiles.el and ~/.doom.d/init.el to get this approach working.
 It is based on the idea that when managing your Doom installation with the doom sync, doom build etc commands you run the commands in vterm or term sessions from the same Chemacs2 session.
 You might consider this post an attempt to get others to find any bugs in my approach as I just got it working and the it works on my system caveat applies.
 Settings in ~/.emacs-profiles.el
  ("doom01" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/doom") (env . (("DOOMDIR" . "~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/config") ("DOOMPATH" . "~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/doom/bin") ("CHEMACS2PROFILE" . "doom01") )) )) 
 Command in $DOOMDIR/init.el
  (setenv "PATH" (concat (expand-file-name (getenv "DOOMPATH") "") ":" (getenv "PATH"))) 
 The setenv command in the Doom config's init.el sets the path to bin/doom in that profile and ~/.doom.d is automatically taken care of by DOOMDIR.
 With the $PATH variable including the path to the relevant bin\doom vterm and term inherit them automatically and the doom xxxx commands work as expected.
 The values in ~/.emacs-profiles.el and that command in init.el are the sole source of truth for mantaining that Doom installations. You don't need to set environment variables or paths anywhere else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Very long time emacs user here with a bunch of elisp under my belt - but this simple problem just eludes me.
 For years, I've done all my testing and running in a compile window.
 Emacs knows error messages that appear in that window, and I can use either M-x next-error to get to the error, or hit return on that line.
 This works pretty well flawlessly for me... but now I have a new tool and only a few of its errors get highlighted this way and I cannot see the difference!
 For example, in the run below, only the second error (fasteners.py) is highlighted and can be reached through next-error or carriage return: see https://imgur.com/a/I6P3egg
 -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: "/code/engora-search/" -*- Compilation started at Thu Sep 29 23:34:35 $ TERM=dumb d engora test --refurb engora/network/request/url_request.py:37:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/parser/fasteners.py:107:9 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/server/search.py:26:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/server/server.py:39:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` Run `refurb --explain ERR` to further explain an error. Use `--quiet` to silence this message 
 Why?
 My only theory was that fasteners.py:107:9 had three digits, the others two, but no: https://imgur.com/a/zgZ85M4 
 The output is already going through my own Python program, so I could easily rewrite it a bit without having to touch the refurb source - if I knew what was wrong.
  
Any ideas? This isn't a game blocker for me at all, but it's weirdly frustrating because I can't work it out. :-D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running Eglot or lsp-mode while working on remote files seems to be a common and rather problematic use-case, so I'm trying to understand why so many people need this.
 I have several projects where I can't or am not allowed to execute any code locally, and instead have a remote machine available for computations. But I've never encountered a project were I can't have the source code itself locally. So what I do is to edit the code locally and periodically sync it with the remote machine.
 The syncing part is admittedly a bit awkward, but there are ways to make it easier or mostly automatic. And then all Emacs features and external tools work fast and smoothly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's two problems I'm running into; the first was, as the title says, that all messages in my Inbox would get marked as ancient except, maybe, a few at the top.
 This would happen every time; if I wait a day (and, so, have new E-mails come in) and then open Gnus again for the first time? All new E-mails marked as ancient.
 And then, recently, the E-mails just stopped showing.
 I'd already edited the Group's parameters to include (visible . t) and turned off scoring. I tried gnus-summary-show-all-threads and gnus-summary-limit-include-dormant (nothing happened and I was informed there were no dormant articles, respectively); I tried C-u M-g (I actually think this is what's causing the previous messages to not show up anymore, other than any which are still marked as new in my Inbox).
 I just want to display all messages and for their status to reflect what's on the E-mail server; if it's new there, Gnus should show new, etc. I'm not using any offline storing or anything, just nnimap. Is there any easy way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm kinda lost on how to make a conjunction function. I have made a data type (not sure if that is the proper name) and i need to add conjunction/disjunction functions for lists. I have my data type as 
 data Formula = ... | ToConj [Formula] | ToDisj [Formula] 
 Theres some other stuff as well where the "..." is but that all works already. I then have:
 conjFun :: [Formula] -> Formula disjFun :: [Formula] -> Formula conjFun = undefined disjFun = undefined 
 From here is where I am not sure what to do. Can anyone help? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-mode for taking notes, mostly math and physics these days, typing LaTeX equations inside org files. For this I use doom emacs.
 I've seen that with markup markers such as "*" (bold) and "/" (italics), org-hide-emphasis-markers allows for showing the effect in the text while getting rid of the cumbersome markers. Moreover, when the point is within markers, they show so one can edit them.
 I was wondering if it is possible to do the same with LaTeX environments like "\begin{equation}" and "\end{equation}", for instance. I've tried with hide-lines.el, which allows for hiding lines matching a regex (in this case, the regex are, for instance: "^\\begin{[a-z]*}"). But although this works, it is far from ideal, as one would need to toggle their visibility for editing them, unlike the more practical way that org-emphasis-hide-markers allows for.
 Is there a way to achieve such result? Thanks in advance for all your help.
 Edit:
 To be clear, I would like to enter something like:
 \begin{equation}
 A = B
 \end{equation}
 and have emacs hide the first and third lines when away from the region, so that only
 A = B
 shows. If possible, I would also like to be able to see the delimiters whenever the point visits the A = B line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use to get Emacs for Mac OS X but now I just download the latest source tarball. I do:  ./configure --with-ns make make install sudo xattr -rds com.apple.quarantine nextstep/Emacs.app  and then move the app bundle to /Applications. But that's not what I'm here to talk about 😃
 When macOS switched to zsh I went through a painful transition. Before then, I had my ns-command-modifier set to meta so M-x would be cmd X for me. With bash, that was ok.
 But zsh opened new possibilities for me and it really wanted the meta on the options key rather than the command key. I honestly don't remember what the pain point was. But in any case, I remapped my emacs to be just the defaults where ns-option-modifier is set to meta and ns-command-modifier is set to super. zsh and emacs have a lot of common abilities so I wanted the key mappings to be the same in both. Rather than twist zsh to accept my unique setup I untwisted my unique emacs setup to be more normal.
 Now, I have an entire set of keys, the "super" keys that I've never had easy access to before.
 For example, using tabs in emacs, I can bind s-{ to tab-previous and s-} to tab-next and switch between tabs just like it was Safari. Instead of two key C-c p for Projectile, (they even suggest), one key s-p. I'm mapping s-r to projectile-rails, s-y to Yari, etc.
 It was and still is a bit painful of a transition but it is well worth it.

 My installation of HLS on Visual Studio Code / Linux Mint 20.3 doesn't work. It complains that it cannot determine my version of GHC. But HLS doesn't even do that.
 I enabled debugging as per the manual:
  
Right click on Haskell extension
 Extension settings
 At the bottom of the list: 
 Haskell > Trace:Client set to debug
 Haskell > Trace:Server set to messages
 
 Restart VSCode
 Load the file - error messages...
 Go to OUTPUT tab
 Right side, select Haskell
  
And is says this:
 "Connection to server is erroring. Shutting down server."
 "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by /home/francis/.ghcup/tmp/ghcup-ghc-8.10.7_cabal-3.6.2.0_hls-1.8.0.0_stack-2.7.5/haskell-language-server-wrapper)"
 If I run ldd -- version it returns GLIBC 2.31
 Any thoughts please.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I visit file foo.py, Emacs opens it in python-mode because the extension ".py" appears in auto-mode-alist This is true even if the file doesn't yet exist.
 However, if I simply create a new buffer called foo.py, using M-x switch-to-buffer, without tying it to a file, the new buffer is opened in fundamental-mode.
 Is there a way to set a new buffer's major mode based on its buffer name, rather than (or in addition to) its filename? I haven't found any hooks that would do the trick. Conversely, is there any reason why I don't want to do this?
 Thanks,
 (ETAA: this is slightly different from this question. That one is about setting the one mode to use in a new buffer. Mine is about calling a function to choose a mode dynamically. But that question seems to imply that there's no hook to do what I want.)

It was not easy to learn how put things away slowly, so that I‘ll be ready quickly when needed. Investing time now for time later. It means changing my personal workflow I‘ve trained over years.
And I‘m happy with the results. In the „Project Notes“ section of my Zettelkasten I now can find 73 smart sketchnotes I’ve already published here on LinkedIn, on Twitter or Instagram.
When did you start with your Zettelkasten? What‘s your learning experience?

 If you have already migrated your app(s) to an alternative OAuth method, no further action is required. Please note that if your app(s) is natively installed you may have to request your users to update the app to the newer version to stop using the OOB method.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow emacsers. Running emacs28.2 (emacs-mac version Mituharu).
 I have observed many intermittent "hanging" of emacs on macOS for several months.
 This has not ever happened to me. At first it looked that I could trigger this feature when using mu4e, opening an html message and scrolling with an arrow downwards. This happened often but not immediately. Because I thought maybe this was mu4e related I chose to use a diffrent client (notmuch). Using notmuch the "hanging" did not happen. However, lately I noticed that the "hanging" could happen using consult-ripgrep searching a 2G sharepoint. And now also during just navigating between frames (on laptop and to screens).
 Q: what things could I do to get an idea what triggers emacs to hang? I do not mind recompiling emacs with special options if needed. Thank you, Marcel

 Python (ScalaPy) support has been gradually introduced in the last few releases, along with supporting Markdown (compiling and running Scala code in .md files) and Spark / Hadoop. You might also notice a lot of recent efforts focusing on improving backwards compatibility with scala/scalac. 
 For those who do not know it, Scala CLI is a command-line tool to interact with the Scala language. It's great for learning the language, writing scripts, prototyping and such.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am writing a novel in emacs, and I use level-1-headings for chapters and level-2-headings for scenes.
 To have the right overview over the length of the current chapter, I wrote a function that counts the number of characters, starting from the outline-up-heading to the outline-forward-same-level, and divides them by 1.800 to give me a feeling for the number of pages the current chapter has.
 If I start the function in the last chapter, though, I get the error message "No following same-level heading". Of course, there is none, and I'd like to use point-max in this case. But how can I find out whether I'm in the last chapter, using elisp? Is there a way to find out whether there is a header of the same level following?
 Thank you for any advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have org-roam set up on both personal and work machines. I've researched how people are using roam / roam-alikes but I am reluctant to get going with note-taking as:
 (1) It feels like a big overhead. I don't feel I have time for journalling / processing notes each day; 
 (2) I am concerned that the very beginning of my roam career is crucial to success, and I may develop bad habits or bad practices which will hold my Zettel back; and
 (3) I live on mobile, and roam workflows are not mobile friendly.
 I'd be interested in testing, by reflecting on the experience of others, the following assumptions I have:
 (a) that roam isn't necessary in a professional environment. I already subscribe to regularly-updated professional resources full of hyperlinks;
 (b) that roam doesn't replace my current org-mode setup of a GTD-like system (which I also struggle to review regularly). Rather it sits alongside it as a "reference" asset;
 (c) that the biggest use of org-roam for me would be in hobbies. For example if I wanted to make a video tutorial, or blog post;
 (d) roam isn't a place to store sensitive everyday information (like passport no, social security details etc); and
 (d) roam is not mobile friendly (I hear logseq works, but only for v1)

 The idea is to program a Windows service that will listen to a hotkey combination and perform some actions after that, for example, with selected text or some buffered data, and then put the result in the clipboard.
 Is it possible to program such service using only Haskell? Or maybe writing pure functions in dll to be called from some Windows-friendly language will be a better solution?

 ```hs (#>) :: Logger a -> (a -> Logger b) -> Logger b Logger la a #> f = let Logger lb b = f a in Logger (la++lb) b 
 compute :: Int -> Logger Int compute x = square x #> add #> double ```
 1) How does this let statement get used? Firstly it contains lb, which isn't passed to the #> function as a parameter, so where does it come from. Secondly, I understand something like let x = 5 in something, where the compiler looks for x in something and replaces it with 5. But in this case Logger lb b doesn't appear anywhere in the in expression, nor does a. So what is it replacing?
 2) How can the compute function call #> without proper parameters? I understand that functions can be partially applied (i.e. you don't pass the last parameter), but in this case we aren't even passing the first parameter - square is not a Logger. (UPDATE: This question is less important than 1) and there's more code for it in the comments, I don't want to make this too big)
 I don't understand this syntax at all.

 in a way this is a follow-up to my post before where paredit hindered ORG-HTML-EXPORT-TO-HTML.
 EDIT: Solved the first problem myself, now I've got another one, see EDIT below.
 I realized that not using PROG-MODE-HOOK for the activation of my PROGRAMMING-SETTINGS is detrimental to my programming workflow. So I wanted to keep the prog-mode stuff as it is and instead hook into the machinery behind org export. However, it seems to work differently, because when I use my "normal" workflow to work with hooks, it errors out, saying "wrong number of arguments".
 My normal workflow consists of defining a function that activates or de-activates stuff, and I call the function via ADD-HOOK. So far, I've not had problems with this workflow.

I'm moving to a new role where my machine will be a fairly locked down Windows setup and from what I can tell they're not allowing WSL or Cyg but I can have native emacs. Go figure. Anyway, I've only ever run Emacs on Linux so I am not sure what all I'm in for. I realize some functionality is just not on the menu but hopefully that's not a show stopper for all development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, just wondering if anyone has worked on any solutions to integrate some git commit message linting tools within magit.
 Can setup tools like Commitlint to add hooks that will reject a commit message if it is invalid, but if you format a commit message incorrectly it simply closes the commit buffer and returns to git status, meaning you have to retype out your commit message, which is obviously less than ideal.
 ​
 Has anyone looked at something like this before or have any suggestions about how to address this?
 Another potential solution is to possibly use a custom commit command that will open a shell in emacs and run something like cz-cli to create commit messages that adhere to things like the conventional commits format. 
 My search has yielded little results, so just wanted to ask others for anything I might be missing or some hints before I maybe start looking at implementing stuff myself :)

This is how we got content-addressed derivations in Nix, the formal verification tool Pirouette, or a yearly book budget to support continuous learning.
In May 2022 our Chief Architect Arnaud Spiwack (@aspiwack) accepted my pitch for “The Nix Book”, agreeing to fund work on improving Nix documentation and onboarding experience for three full months.
This is a comprehensive report on what happened since and what I learned from it.

tl;dr
The goal of the project was to improve Nix onboarding and documentation experience to increase community growth by writing “The Nix Book”.

 The last time I was seriously doing Rails was 2010 or so. emacs-rails and emails-rails-rebooted seem dead. The Emacs wiki wasn't much help. I have notes about using web-mode but the code is commented out as if I tried it and didn't like it. I know about rspec-mode and will likely use that again.

 (lsp +eglot +peek) 
 Basically, I've installed lsp-mode and eglot at the same time. The reason is that eglot works over TRAMP, while lsp-mode not. Also, I use a lot lsp-ltex and it depends directly of lsp-mode
 My question is: how could I disable eglot when using my local files and let that lsp-mode takes charge of everything, BUT reverse the roles when I'm in a remote file over TRAMP and shutdown lsp-mode and make eglot the lsp manager?
 Is it so hard to do or not? 
 Thanks.

 Consider that you are editing a plaint text file. If your editor is Kate, you can use both RET and C-RET (in Emacs parlance) to get two different results. For example, if your file is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been studying definitional interpreters written in Haskell as part of a programming languages course. We talked about writing in monadic style as an elegant way to implement non-determinism or exceptions or precise evaluation order. This got me wondering, is there a way to design an applicative interpreter which uses applicative functors as its interface?
 If this is possible, I could imagine a new design space. Since every monad gives rise to an applicative, there would be a broad range of applicatives to consider. Applicatives are also simpler to reason with, which could make the resulting languages more accessible for proofs.
 So far, I'm not sure that this is possible. Local 'let' definitions and lambda abstractions seem to require the full power of monads.

 With thanks for the assistance of this sub, I'm up and running with org-roam v2 after a hiatus from org-roam (v1). I've followed the System Crafters tutorial.
 I have an aesthetic issue the backlinks in my roam buffer are ugly (showing the full link in square brackets):
 ``` Backlinks (1) System Crafters (Top) They sometimes make videos about [[id:8ccffdbb-45c9-4826-b66a-182c085f6da7][programming languages]] like
 [[id:6f63cb5a-2866-4746-8f7d-2e14241afed9][Emacs Lisp]] and [[id:d16ab718-9d9a-4142-befd-6ef51dbe6224][Scheme]]
 ```
 It seems from a Github issue that this may be because of org-descriptive-links, but I'm struggling to find information on that. It's not in the Org manual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/haskell community!
 For the context, in case you haven't seen my posts before: SimpleX Chat is the first messaging platform that has no user identifiers, not even random numbers The messages are e2e encrypted, and the servers and network observers cannot see users' contacts or groups. You can use the servers pre-configured in the apps or host your own.
 What's new in v4:
  
local database encryption with passphrase. It's using SQLCipher as a replacement of SQLite, via our forks of direct-sqlite/sqlite-simple, it worked very well on all platforms - iOS, Android, Linux, Mac, we only didn't manage to compile encryption for Windows yet.
 improved stability of chat groups, file transfers and message delivery.
 you can now use your own WebRTC ICE servers for audio-video calls.
 German language in the interface.
  
See full release announcement for more details.
 Download the apps via the links in our GitHub repo: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#readme.
 Please ask any questions
 You comments, questions and criticism here are very welcome - I will try to answer all the questions!
 Also, we are hosting the event on Discord on October 6, at 6pm UK / 10am PT - please join via this link to:
  
learn how SimpleX Chat is different and why it provides better meta-data privacy than alternatives,
 hear about future platform development plans,
 ask any questions,
 criticize what we do,
 suggest improvements.
  
Once you install the app you can choose "Connect to developers" to ask any questions, suggest new features and to join the group of users.
 About SimpleX Platform
 Some links to answer the most common questions:
 How can SimpleX deliver messages without user identifiers.
 What are the risks to have identifiers assigned to the users.
 Technical details and limitations.
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc..

 I'm trying to figure out how to bind Ctrl-n and Ctrl-p in an evil-mode key map but I'm not sure sure which one is most correct:
 (define-key evil-<?>-state-map (kbd "C-n") #'evil-next-visual-line) (define-key evil-<?>-state-map (kbd "C-p") #'evil-previous-visual-line) 
 First, am I setting myself up for some sort of problems with evil-mode and thus this is a bad idea? If not, does anyone know what would be the appropriate map?
 I appreciate any input from folks who are evil-mode users. Thx.
 EDIT: evil-normal-state-map perhaps?

 Prince Hamlet of Denmark is the son of the recently deceased King Hamlet, and nephew of King Claudius, his father’s brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet’s widow, Gertrude, Hamlet’s mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouring Norway, in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras’s infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king’s son, Prince Fortinbras, is imminent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 After installing Emacs from package, my logs are full of warnings such as:
 Warning (comp): c: /tools/emacs/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/org/org-entities.el: Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Warning (comp): C: \\ ProgramData \\ chocolatey \\ lib \\ mingw \\ tools \\ install \\ mingw64 \\ bin \\ libgccjit-0.dll: error: error invoking gcc driver 
 I noticed that the problem is that emacs uses "global" gcc (installed by chocolatey) instead of the local gcc embedded in the installation directory. I don't have and don't need all emacs dependencies in my mingw main directories. Is it possible to somehow set the configuration so that it works only on "own" embedded compiler?
 So far, I have been able to work around the problem by removing mingw from the system env path, I write mainly in python and golang, but if I need it again, the problem will come back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The utility of uniqueness typing - as evidenced by it being separately adopted by Clean and Mercury, as well as having echoes in Rust - is straightforward: it enforces a typing discipline that ensures values only have a single reference. (or none, in the case of Rust) Hence, using them to model side-effecting sequential code is straightforward, as destructive update and imperative control in uniquely-typed code can't pollute what's outside.
 Linear types are more elegant and intuitive from an abstract perspective, but weaken that guarantee : a linear arrow in Haskell can mint a linear value out of an immutable "plain" value with multiple references. Hence, although no more references may be added once it's been created, in-place destructive update isn't guaranteed to be safe.
 All is not lost, though: as linear types can only be used once anyways, it would, for practical purposes, suffice to show that they are eventually unique - that, by the time of their use/destruction, they only have a single reference. One could also consider a sequence of linear arrow applications, such that it converges to uniqueness in the given reference to which they were applied.
 Are there meaningful assumptions which strengthen linearity to uniqueness without dropping the theoretical cleanness? (like wrapping them in an opaque monad)

 If I just disable it works:

 Works

 Should it be like that? Or am I missing something?
 I'm a bit of a noob here, so any help is appreciated. Thanks

 UPDATE:
 I found out that the issue lies with python's jedi-language-server. If I use pyright this doesn't happen. It also works in elisp buffers, so that gave away that somehow jedi isn't working properly.
 For now, I'm going to be using pyright. One question though - is there a way to run several checkers at the same time? For instance, I would like to run flake8, pyright AND mypy.

 I'm a bit rusty on Nix so would love some help here :pray:
 Almost totally fresh M1 Pro Macbook Pro, just installed Nix and home-manager. I'm following the channel 22.05. Installed `ghc` fine, so I have 9.0.2, but when trying to install `haskell-language-server`, I get a segfault (exit code 139) when building Fourmolu which is a dependency. I get the same when trying to install Agda. Both happen whether through home-manager or not, and also whether from nixpkgs-unstable or 22.05. I suspect it's because Nix is for some reason using a really old version of clang (11) when it should be 13+ for M1s I believe.
 I can't believe I couldn't find this error anywhere no matter how…]]></summary>

 We're also actively involved in the community via the Haskell Foundation.
 We do some project work for clients and we build own products. Each of those teams could use more people right now so we're not hiring for a specific one - we'll discuss that in the interview process.
 While we'd be happy to hire senior people we aren't limiting ourselves to that for this current round of hiring. If you're interested then let's chat!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I have recently started taking denote notes in org format, using code snippets where appropriate. 
 Ever since I started considering to build a personal blog out of these notes using lazyblorg, the capacity to export an org file to html has risen in importance. This was also the context in which I realized an org-babel/source block behaviour that I don't understand.
 Frequently, when I want to quickly test how a note looks in html, I run into the error "unmatched bracket or quote" which aborts the html export.
 Now, I've started to narrow the initial problem down to a few problematic aspects: apparently, org-babel tries to match "<>" and "' '", both of which I generally used. However, since the lisp-babel-block doesn't use any of those signs as delimiters, why can't I use them? 
 Find below a block of things that I'd like to, but can't, use:
 #+BEGIN_SRC lisp (defvar *my-list* '(a b c)) ; This doesn't work because of ' (second *my-list*) ;; => b ; This doesn't work because of > (mapcar #'list *my-list*) ; This doesn't work because of ' #+END_SRC 
 Now that I think of it, I also can't use either of these in regular text, which is pretty annoying. I would like to be able to use #' since it is something I'd want to explain to myself using a note.
 Is there a way that I can modify this behaviour?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just curious: If you've played around with several FP languages (especially typed), how do you think Scala compares with them? What is similar and what is different? 
 Some context: 
 I've been on a programming language exploration journey for the last year or so and I'm trying to learn as many FP languages as I can. I've looked into Haskell, the various Lisps/Schemes, F#, Ocaml, Elm, Rust, etc.... Racket (a Scheme) and the ML-based languages (F#, Ocaml) have been my favorites so far, though they're also not without their weaknesses. Racket and OCaml are both fantastic languages (I found myself favoring the latter due to the type system), but kinda suffer from having a relatively small ecosystem -- and in the case of Ocaml, rather poor tooling. F# offers a much better ecosystem, and in fact it's the language I've used the most (I love ADTs). There's also something very elegant about the ML syntax, even though F# lacks some of the more interesting features of OCaml. One non-trivial weakness of F#, imo, is that eventually you're going to have to resort to some (or sometimes a lot) non-FP/OOP code due to its ties with the C# and the .NET environment. And that can be a drag.
 I've also tried a little Clojure, and it's a nice enough language (happy not to have to deal with Java), though I can't say that I'm in love with it. Overall, it just seems like a less elegant Scheme, and I don't see much of a reason to use it over something like Racket/Scheme, except for maybe the larger collection of libraries that are available on the JVM (OK, the hot reloading feature is also neat, but not something I necessarily care about).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thank you for this amazing sub.
 I have a question on how to better make tests. I am still very new to Haskell and there are a lot of newbie things I still haven't grasped so please bear with me.
 Say I have a data type that represents an expression in a abstract syntax tree.
 ​
 data Express = Bin String Express Express | BoolLit Bool | NumLit Int | StrinLit String | Unita String Express 
 Now I could do something like
 import qualified Generic.Random as GR instance Arbitrary Express where 
 arbitrary = GR.genericArbitrary GR.uniform
 But then I will get a ton of examples that I don't care to check for.
 For example:
  Binary "+" (NumLit 3) (BoolLit True) 
 Ideally I would want to generate an arbitrary that only produces valid examples.
 I get this is where I have to do some work.
 I played around with 
 ​
 instance Arbitrary Express where arbitrary = sized exprArb where exprArb s = do frequency [ (1, do num <- arbitrary return $ (NumLit num) ), (1, do expr1 <- arbitrary expr2 <- arbitrary str <- vectorOf 1 $ Test.QuickCheck.elements ['+', '-', '*', '/'] return $ Bin str expr1 expr2 ........ 
 The issue with the above is now I am manually making this to only be `Bin` and `NumLit`
 ​
 I think the solution would be to make an type/alias for only Bin/NumLit, Bin/StringLit, Bin/Bool.
 Then make a `GR.genericArbitrary GR.uniform` out of those.
 ​
 Not sure how to do that. Or if that is even the right way.
 What is the best way to leverage QuickCheck to test this without changing `data Express` ?

 I've been using org mode for 2 years, and am now dabbling with org-roam as I have a lot of learning to do (professional development courses etc) - so want to try a Zettel' method of retaining the learnings in a "conversational" way.
 I think I have followed one-too-many tutorials, and ended up with a non-working config, because my roam buffer doesn't show backlinks. I'm creating notes using org-roam-node-find or links SPC m l l or both.
 My buffer just shows one "backlink" which is persistent no matter which file I visit.
 My config.el looks like:
 ```

 Sadly, there were not support for Emacs.. until now!
 After 1(busy) year, the merge request for MELPA it's done, and now it has fully support with these two packages: 
  
islisp-mode](https://melpa.org/#/islisp-mode): major mode for editing files
 inferior-islisp (https://melpa.org/#/inferior-islisp): REPL integration with Emacs
  
The code is in the repo: https://gitlab.com/sasanidas/islisp-mode
 Happy hacking!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've put together the first release (0.0.1) for echopraxia-plusakka, a structured logging module that adds structured logging mapping for Akka components -- Actor(Ref|Path|System|Context) etc -- and also adds some type enrichment and utility classes to expose loggers intuitively.
 https://github.com/tersesystems/echopraxia-plusakka
 Note that this doesn't go through LoggingAdapter, Akka's internal logging pipeline. Everything run through LoggingAdapter was processed into a String, so you couldn't represent data in two different formats depending on the appender -- in Echopraxia, argument serialization is deferred, so you can have logfmt on console and JSON on the backend. 
 This also means you don't have to rely on MDC or the built-in toString methods in Akka any more. Probably the biggest relief is being able to map ByteString to {length=11 utf8String=some string} so it has binary/text data available.
 Your domain messages in Akka can be handled using automatic derivation, and logging is type safe -- if there's no ToValue mapping, the logging statement just won't compile.
 Hope you like it!
 (Comments about Akka's business license / future are not welcome, please keep it on topic.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am a newbie in Haskell, but I want to use it to run some simulations for work.
 In particular, I am trying to write a function to compute the barycentric coordinates of a point and determine whether it is inside a triangle or not.
 Before anyone asks: it's not for rendering or game programming.
 I wrote the following code trying to translate my original C code:
 data Vec2D = Vec2D Double Double deriving (Show) data Triangle = Triangle Vec2D Vec2D Vec2D deriving(Show) v2c:: Vec2D -> (Double,Double) v2c (Vec2D x y) = (x,y) barycentric:: Vec2D -> Triangle -> (Double,Double,Double) barycentric (Vec2D xp yp) (Triangle a b c) = if db == 0 || dg == 0 then (-1,-1,-1) else (alpha,beta/db,gamma/dg) where (xp1,yp1) = v2c a (xp2,yp2) = v2c b (xp3,yp3) = v2c c dg = ((yp1 - yp2) * xp3 + (xp2 - xp1) * yp3 + xp1 * yp2 - xp2 * yp1) db = ((yp1 - yp3) * xp2 + (xp3 - xp1) * yp2 + xp1 * yp3 - xp3 * yp1) gamma = ((yp1 - yp2) * xp + (xp2 - xp1) * yp + xp1 * yp2 - xp2 * yp1)/dg beta = ((yp1 - yp3) * xp + (xp3 - xp1) * yp + xp1 * yp3 - xp3 * yp1)/db alpha = 1 - beta - gamma 
 The code compiles and, from my tests, it seems to work.
 As per the subject of the post:
  
How can I improve it?
 is the division by dg and db ok in the "where block" or should I be worried about a "divide by 0" error?
 Is there a better way to do this without having such a big "where block"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got an environment variable called $HOST and it seems that Emacs doesn't read it early enough. It usually isn't available during the execution of init.el
 It s present in the environment frm which I run Emacs.
 (getenv "HOST") returns a blank and it is annoying as my custom-file includes the USER and HOST variables so I can use the same configuration on different systems without clobbering the custom.el.
 Once Emacs fully loads it is available and (getenv "HOST") works fine.
 Is there some reason Emacs behaves this way for this particular variable?
 SOLVED
 I checked my .profile and realized that in this instance the config file which creates the HOST variable was not being source'd, so I've fixed it in this instance.
 The problem dates back some years ago when the default Debian environment was not creating a variable I needed so I had to add
 export HOST=$(hostname)
 to my .profile to ensure it would be available to GUI programs.

 I'm starting with early-init.el, and may add my own modules later, but I'm worried that when I update doom from the repo some of my settings will be overwritten.
 The logical thing to do it seems is to create my own branch of the original clone and make my own changes there. Then when I want to upgrade, I switch to the original master, pull the new changes, and cherry-pick the parts I need that don't conflict with my changes etc, but my git-fu is weak.
 Any experiences or advice in that respect? Are there some things to do or avoid that will make things easier?
 PS. I am also on the master branch which says 3.0.0-pre although the latest stable tag 2.0.9. Does that make much of a difference?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning! ☀️
 We're kicking off this week with new releases for both Indigo (Scala.js Game Engine) and Tyrian (Scala.js Elm-like Web Framework).
 It's been a while since we last pushed out new versions, but we're still working hard on both projects! The libraries are increasingly stable and we're having as much fun working with them as on them these days. 😊
 Indigo 0.14.0
 This release includes many improvements, fixes, and enhancements, but the exciting new feature is timeline animations!
 Even simple animations for title screens used to be very difficult in Indigo, but they now have a dedicated and rather fun solution.
 Release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.14.0
 (As a bonus, the Roguelike-starterkit has also had a tiny update to keep it inline with Indigo.)
 Tyrian 0.6.0
 Version 0.5.0 rebuilt Tyrian to run on Cats Effect 3 and fs2 from the ground up, but you were locked into using IO, and you couldn't use fs2 directly in your web apps. This release adds...
  
The ability to use fs2 Streams for subscriptions
 Support for ZIO 2.0*
  
We've also added a swathe of other quality-of-life improvements.
 Release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.6.0
 (\ You'll need to use a snapshot of the interop-cats library until the next release, but it works just fine. See the release notes.)*
 Getting Started
 You can get started with either project with their g8 templates:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian.g8
 ...or by heading over to the awesome: https://scribble.ninja/
 Documentation can be found at https://indigoengine.io/ and https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/.
 As always, please report any issues, and if you need any help, do come and say hello on Discord.

 Some experience with org mode, trying to bend code blocks to my will.
 Trying to use org to pass a json file into python script while developing it. I really would like to keep the json highlighting that org-mode provides. 
 If I were doing it in bash I might create the file as bash cat > /tmp/args.json <<HERE { "JSON_HERE": "Here is some JSON" } HERE 
 The python script will be written from a template and expects input from a file. If invoked at the command line, the command is python library/my\_test.py /tmp/args.json
 For the JSON part, I have JSON set up as an org-mode language language and that provides syntax highlighting and pop-out editing, but of course there is nothing to execute. An example block would almost do it, but there is no simple way to save that to a file AFAIK
 For the python part, there is lots of information in the manual as to how to pass in various elisp list, tables, properties etc but all I need is a simple file name. Any ideas how to do that without changing my code?
 Apologies if these are dumb questions.
 Cheers 
 Steven.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've stumbled upon this post by Jim Nielsen:
https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/markdown-sans-front-matter/
It describes how he went from Markdown files with metadata as YAML frontmatter:
---
title: My Blog Post
tags:
  - html
  - css
---

Start my blog post here.

... to just Markdown:
#html #css

# My Blog Post

Start my blog post here.

Jim's trick is to put the "slug" (i.e. the unique identifier that determines the URL of the published piece, which in the case of example.com/posts/my-amazing-post/ is the my-amazing-post part) into the filename. His filenames are of the format <YYYY-MM-DD>-<url-slug>.md, so starting with an ISO date, then the URL "path".
Making blogging simpler this way reminds me of how the way Sascha's and my Zettel format changed over the years, and how Sascha's very minimal solution eventually came about and sticks around since then:
# <ID> <TITLE>
<tags>

<content>

Very similar approach: make it pleasant for the human, let the app do the work. Avoid ceremony and technobabble.
I'd argue that Jim Nielsen's approach of putting hashtags before the title can worsen interoperability with applications that treat the first line of a file as the title -- but while that behavior is popular in a niche of plain text note-taking apps, it never really became a mainstream expectation, so 🤷‍♂️]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not like to set internal-border-with to anything other than 0, because I don't want the mode-line to not extend across the entire frame. So I've been looking for ways of adding a bit of 'padding' to my frame. 
 Left and right it's straightforward: simple set the fringe to some suitable width. Top padding is less so. 
 I figured I could make use of the header-line for that, and this seemed like a good start:
 (setq header-line-format " ") 
 Now, I found having a whole blank line of padding a bit much (I know...), so I tried specifying the height property in the value of header-line-format directly: 
 (setq header-line-format (propertize " " 'face '(:height 80))) 
 But that doesn't make a difference unless the height property is greater than that of header-line. 
 The only way I've found to make the header-line take up less than the default line height is by messing with the height of header-line. Unfortunately, some modes make use of the header-line for displaying stuff, so I find myself having to add hooks to every mode I encounter that does make use of the header-line, e.g.
 (defun my/reset-header-line-face () (face-remap-add-relative 'header-line '(:height 180))) (add-hook 'use-package-statistics-mode-hook 'my/reset-header-line-face) 
 Does anyone know or can think of a less ad-hoc solution?

 This only happens with Haskell which is weird.
 Also it's always saying "GHCup is not installed" when I clearly have it installed, can this be the problem?
 I am using EndeavourOS (basically Arch Linux) and my extensions are Haskell, Haskell HSX and Haskell Syntax Highlighting.
 In Windows 10 I have no problem using Haskell in VS Codium
 EDIT: Solved! I had to use the codium command to open VS Codium from the terminal. If you use normal VS Code just use code.This is not a direct fix to my issue but it's good enough for me, in the comments you can find the actual solution if you have patience to do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago i bought an expensive guitar. I played it for maybe 2 months and one of the strings started producing some ringing. The guitar came with a 5 year warranty. I took it to the shop, they tried to fix it but failed and offered me a new one. I readily accepted the exchange.
 A few months down the line even this guitar had some issues with ringing here and there. You'd be surprised to know that they again gave me a new one.
 Now, onto my third guitar. I started getting a bit better at playing by now (I had already been playing for years but didn't practice everyday until I invested in this guitar) and started understanding some technical details about the guitar, servicing it myself and also some just non technical things. I also saw the guitar Willie Nelson plays (it literally has a gouged hole in it and honestly most people who don't know it would chuck it in garbage).
 I realized that it's a guitar, it's made of wood and in a certain sense is alive. It's not going to be perfect but it's my Guitar. I know how to make it work. I practice on it everyday and I know how to manage those little details.
 You see where I'm going with this? I moved to Emacs a month ago. Objectively, it might be the worse choice compared to my setup on VSCode but it's my editor. Sure they'd be some jank and some small errors and bugs I can't fix but I can always service it myself. I can always make it better. I'd learn with it and grow with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are some the steps when trying to resolve errors from cabal build that fails because of dependencies not compiling? I'm not a seasoned user and lack experience with the build tools, but seem to encounter these build issues more often than I would like to. For example I currently have this error. Ok, so one transitive dependency (diagrams-lib-1.4.5.3) that will not compile because of variable not in scope. I then try to lower the version bounds for dependencies that depend on diagrams-lib-1.4.5.3 in hopes that a lower version will not have this same issue:
 Chart >=1.8 && <1.10 , Chart-diagrams >=1.8 && <1.10 
 To:
 Chart >=1.7.0 && <1.8 , Chart-diagrams >=1.7.0 && <1.8 
 This causes another compilation error which I don't understand, as I have already tried various version bounds. So now I don't have any ideas left.
 Why would transitive dependency not compile, shouldn't this be solved by the dependency that uses it before being uploaded as a library for general usage?

 Let's say I have this file:
 ``` * An example
 +begin_src sh :results output
 curl -I google.com
 +end_src
 ```
 I evaluate that src block, so now my file looks like:
 ``` * An example
 +begin_src sh :results output
 curl -I google.com
 +end_src
 +RESULTS:
 +begin_example
 HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Location: http://www.google.com/ Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Date: Sun, 25 Sep 2022 16:22:36 GMT Expires: Tue, 25 Oct 2022 16:22:36 GMT Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000 Server: gws Content-Length: 219 X-XSS-Protection: 0 X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

 ```
 But when I export (to Markdown as an example here, but all export backends seem to behave the same way), I don't get the results block:
 ```
 Table of Contents
  
 An example
  
<a id="org6ad066a"></a>
 An example
 curl -I google.com 
 ```
 I know about :exports both, but that re-evaluates the src block on export to generate a new results block, which I don't want. In my case, I need to capture results at a point in time--which I do by manually evaluating the src block in the buffer. I then want to be able to export those existing point-in-time results to other formats. Is there a way to do this? Am I missing something simple here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is a topic which has popped up a few times recently...
 I'm curious if anyone has any advice on annotating non-Org/Org Roam documents -- mostly PDFs -- in a way that allows the annotations to be integrated with Org/Org Roam? There has been some chatter here recently about forking + updating org-noter and I'm monitoring that situation.
 Are there other options out there?
 Is it worth considering the option of having some other tool host the annotations and hooking into that via .el? So, for instance, if Calibre supported annotation (it does not) would it be a better approach to include annotation support in calibredb.el?
 Thoughts? Opinions?
 FWIW, I've been doing a ton of research lately and it would be so nice to be able to pull non-Org stuff into the reach of the Org and Org Roam ecosystem in terms of linking, excerpts, and search.

But I did notice that Modalka defines fewer keymaps than Boon does. Modalka only provides two modes for editing and everything else, while Boon provides more modes.
 So I suspect that really what's happening is that they are managing keymaps. Is this actually true? Or am I missing something important?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started trying out nnreddit, a Reddit backend for GNUS. Out of the box, an refresh take around 3 minutes.
 I peeked into the source code of nnreddit and it seems that most of the time it spent is just accept-process-output. This should play well with cooperative threading. So out of curiosity, I tried
 (make-thread (lambda () (gnus-group-get-new-news)) "Gnus Get News") 
 Guess what -- it works! It does the work in the background without blocking emacs, and update the *Group* buffer once it's done.
 Surprisingly I didn't find anything similar online. I wonder have anyone experimented similiar techiques with more heavy usage? I have no idea how robust this is -- I could be very lucky with nnreddit, its source code has a bunch of with-mutex. I guess that suggests it's written with concurrency in mind? But it doesn't really use any concurrency out of the box, really puzzling...
 P.S. I know the workaround of running multiple Emacsen, but I don't really like it, because I would no longer have one single Lisp image where interoperation between applications is as simple as a function call, or hacking into each other's variables...

 ```
 +name: foo-overall
 +begin_src haskell :tangle foo.hs
 <<foo-a>> <<foo-b>>
 +end_src
 ```
 somewhere in my Org file and I have the definitions of these <<...>> noweb style references like this:
 ```
 +name: foo-a
 +begin_src haskell
 hello
 +end_src
 +name: foo-b
 +begin_src haskell
 world
 +end_src
 ```
 I would like to run org-html-export-to-html but make it so that:
  
each of the exported code blocks foo-a and foo-b link back to their location in foo-overall and
 foo-overall automatically links each of its <<foo-a>> and <<foo-b>> lines inside its code block to their respective definitions.
  
In other words, I would like these noweb style references to link to each other in both directions. This is so that after going to the definition of <<foo-a>> I want a link to click so that I can go back to the discussion for foo-overall and vice versa.
 AFAIK, #1 can be achieved by manually inserting Org refs (e.g. (ref:...) in the src block for foo-overall) as per https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html and then manually inserting a caption for the src blocks of <<foo-a>> and <<foo-b>>. However this is extremely tedious and is basically a deal-breaker for me.
 I've searched around for a solution for #2 and the closest thing I found was this comment. The script there just collects a list of all src blocks and inserts this list as a "References ..." note to every src block, which is too verbose. I see that there's a Stackoverflow question but it has gone unanswered.
 I can probably hack something together outside of elisp but was wondering if anyone had a similar desire to make noweb references automatically linked everywhere. Help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The default behaviour of org-store-link in an ordinary text file is to create a file: link with a search string, e.g. file:myfile.txt::Line 42. That doesn't suit me when creating links in certain cases so I added the following function to org-create-file-search-functions in order to instead get links like file:myfile.txt::42:
  (defun org-projectile-annotate-file-search-func () (when (and (projectile-project-p) (get-buffer-window "project-annotations.org")) (number-to-string (line-number-at-pos)))) 
 That works as expected, but then I read this bit in the documentation of org-create-file-search-functions
  
A function in this hook may also use setq to set the variable description to provide a suggestion for the descriptive text to be used for this link when it gets inserted into an Org buffer with org-insert-link.
  
I thought that might give me a way to make the description of the link a bit nicer (currently the description is the same as the link itself). However, I can't get it to work.
 I changed the function to
  (defun org-projectile-annotate-file-search-func () (when (and (projectile-project-p) (get-buffer-window "project-annotations.org")) (setq description "foobar") (number-to-string (line-number-at-pos)))) 
 but the link's description did not change. I then read the code for org-store-link and found no reference to description, but I did find desc so I did a setq on desc instead. Still no change to the link description.
 What is it I'm missing here? Or maybe the documentation is wrong?

 I’ve been working with Python for 3 years and I begun to explore the idea of learning a new language. I have done some projects at work using PySpark and I thought that going full blown Spark (i.e. learning Scala) would be a sensible option.
 However, I have no previous knowledge of Java and people also tend to be slightly negative about the idea of learning Scala for Spark since PySpark does a very similar thing… or so they say.
 My current job is a mixture of Python + databases… with a little bit of big data.
 What are you thoughts?
 Many thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello all.
 I've recently been using exwm and it's comfy, I like and dislike it's quirks.
 I have one question: is there any advantage on running exwm with a normal emacs client vs running emacs --daemon -f exwm-enable? I have sx configured that it launches dbus-run-session emacs and it works fine. but now I do this:
 s6-rc -l /tmp/${USER}/s6-rc -u change emacs-exwm
 while ! [ -e /run/user/1000/emacs/server ]
 do
 continue
 done
 exec dbus-launch /usr/bin/emacsclient -c
 where the first line it's just a supervised emacs --fg-daemon f exwm-enable.
 with this approach I can control emacs via kdeconnect (emacsclient --eval '(blabla)'), but is there any disadvantage?
 TL;DR when using exwm, is it better to use emacs with or without server-mode?

 I've configured emacs to use lsp-mode for several languages e.g. haskell when visiting a .hs file, python for a .py file. 
 These all work as expected according to my configuration.
 What happens often to me though is:
  
Open up such a file 
 lsp-mode fires up and connects (correctly) to the appropriate language server.
 
Edit other files of the same kind - all use the same languages server instance. Happy. 👍🏼
 
Kill the buffers using lsp-mode and connected to the languages server, one by one over time. 
 Close emacsclient (emacs server continues running as it should)
 
Language server is also still running despite having no more clients connected.
 
 Is it possible to have lsp-mode kill the language server automatically when there are no more clients?

 find an elegant way to pass box to fun if it contains a String.
 in an ideal world we could have something like
 (boxes: Seq[Box[Any]])).collect { case box @ Box(_: String) => fun(box) } 
 but that won't work in reality
 (boxes: Seq[Box[Any]])).collect { case box @ Box(string: String) => fun(box.copy(a = string)) } 
 works, but it's a wart, and I think will result in an allocation
 (boxes: Seq[Box[Any]])).collect { case box @ Box(string: String) => fun(box.asInstanceOf[Box[String]) } 
 also works, but it's a wart and runs the risk that a future refactor gets the type in the cast different from the type in the pattern match

So, I've been writing linked notes for a few years now, and I've found some of the posts from this community to be particularly insightful, especially seeing behind-the-scenes of other people's processes. (I also adopted the idea of UIDs from this forum, which I use constantly).
While I've used my notes regularly for myself–during my work and for writing articles–I've never shared any of my notes directly. So, I recently decided to start posting some online straight from my editor – a place where I spend a decent part my day thinking and researching.
I always find it useful to see how other people record and connect their thinking, and I hope this might be interesting/helpful. I'll be adding to the collection on Twitter every couple of days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a function that exports all the tables in the subtree at point to a single CSV file. I tried to implement this by narrowing to the subtree at point and then applying org-table-map-tables:
 (defun sbr-org-export-subtree-tables () "Export the Org tables in subtree at point to TSV file." (interactive) (save-excursion (while (/= (org-current-level) 1) (org-up-heading-safe)) (let* ((table nil) (chapter (car (split-string (nth 4 (org-heading-components)) ":"))) (file (format "%s.csv" (replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" (downcase chapter))))) (org-narrow-to-subtree) (org-table-map-tables (lambda () (setq table (nconc table (cddr (org-table-to-lisp))))) t) (org-toggle-narrow-to-subtree) (with-temp-buffer (orgtbl-insert-elisp-table table) (beginning-of-buffer) (org-table-export file "orgtbl-to-tsv"))))) 
 I notice that this function is exporting all the tables in the buffer, not just the tables in the current subtree. It appears that org-table-map-tables is ignoring the narrowing of the buffer to the subtree. Is this a bug, or am I misunderstanding how org-table-map-tables is intended to be used?

This isn't too much of a concern as I can switch to Emacs control from evil, but I was wondering if there is a way to see the evil bindings easily so I wouldn't have to switch back and forth. 
 If someone can give me a clue or point me in the right direction that would be appreciated. My google-fu is failing me currently

 I uncommented Python and running doom doctor came up with some errors about some addons.
 > :lang python ! Couldn't find isort. Import sorting will not work. ! Couldn't find pipenv. pipenv support will not work. ! Couldn't find nosetests. Running tests through nose will not work. ! Couldn't find pytest. Running tests through pytest will not work. 
 I suspect running pip to install the necessary python and emacs packages will fix those.
 Until LSP and pyls are installed is Python support provided by flycheck or some package installed by default?
 A worry I have is to know if what Doom did used Python 2 or Python 3 as both are installed on my system. I also saw some pip messages and perhaps that also involves Python 2
 Is that something I need to worry about now, or can that be deferred till later?

To be specific. Haskell, Python, and Java. Python and Java I have no problem with. But for some reason, I cannot wrap my head around Haskell. I have tried everything. This class is a requirement for my degree and only one person teaches it. I've done well in my other classes and am familiar with a lot of other languages and I feel like I am about to throw tens of thousands of dollars away on a degree because I am struggling with one niche language that I never want to use again. I passed all the hard classes in my degree and my entire education hangs on this. No offense to people who love Haskell. I understand it can be a great language in certain uses. Anyone who was like a lost puppy when they started learning Haskell, what resources did you use? My degree, financial well-being, and mental health depend on it. Haskell is worth about 25% of the overall course grade and I already bombed the first assignment. Unfortunately, her questions are very hard and the homework is very strict on using resources and other people.
 She low key expects us to be fluent in haskell in just five weeks.
 I hope this post is okay here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that I have tamed end of line comments to line up with proportional fonts (using the display attribute :halign-to, which lets you make text display at a particular physical column), I'm wondering if I might be able to do the same for c++ lines which are indented because of being continuations of a statement for a previous line.
 This isn't such a big deal as the comment thing was, as it only affects continued lines, and looks OK anyway the way it is. But it would be nice - normally emacs will line things like an argument on a continuation line with the enclosing parenthesis from the function call, but with a proportional font it only ends up approximating that.
 ​
 It seems like what I would have to do, is in the code that calculates what character from the line above to line this line up with, calculate the physical position of that character and add the spaces, but also visually indent the next line using :halign-to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I opened up VS Code for the first time in a long time. There was a file I wanted to edit outside of my normal project, and sometimes I like a separate editor for that so it's not polluting all the buffer lists and whatnot I have open.
 I saw that the clangd integration was available, so I turned it on, and I opened one of my normal project files.
 Why is clangd integration in VSCode so much faster and less painless? It came up with completions right away. I didn't have huge stalls while I waited for things to happen?
 I can only guess that something is weird with my setup, so I have to get rid of everything and start over, I think. I'll start with basically nothing except keybindings and eglot and p4.el and see if it's any better, because right now this is insupportable. The clangd integration in VSCode is faster than any code completion in Visual Studio or Jetbrains Rider, even with indexing turned on. I'd thought my stalls were because of clangd itself, and the absurd number of files it had indexed, but it's really not. I don't get symbol lookout timeouts in VS Code. There's something else afoot.

 For experimentation purposes I would like to compile lucid-emacs for alpine.
 I can't even find the lucid-emacs source code if such a thing exists. The github mirror for emacs is here.
 The original GNU emacs repo is here.
 I have found this page for emacs-lucid here which I am not so sure.
 So to sum up:
  
Does emacs-lucid have its own repo?
 Is it possible to compile it for alpine?

 To make my use of Mu4e an even better experience, I would love to combine for autocompletion the mail-addresses of org-contacts with the automatically collected mail-adresses of the mu database. I am using helm and tried out John Kitchins solution from https://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/03/14/A-helm-mu4e-contact-selector/, but if I (require 'org-contacts), the variable mu4e~contacts-for-completion is void, and if I do not (require 'org-contacts), I get the error: Symbonl's function definition is void: org-contacts-db.
 Does anyone of you combine the two sources for e-mail-address completion in mu4e, and how have you solved it?
 I was setting hopes in mu4e-contacts (https://gitlab.com/voidyourwarranty/mu4e-contacts). Regrettably, when I add the package and restart emacs, I get (error Recursive ‘require’ for feature ‘mu4e’).
 Thank you for any help and insights!
 I am using mu4e 1.8.9 and the newest version of org-contacts (that is on melpa again, yeah!).

 I've got an application that appears to get slower over time. I currently have no idea why. Ram usage seems constant, CPU usage seems low. But after a while, requests to the API take longer and longer.
 The problem is that I have no idea how to start working out where the performance issues are. It can take days before the problem sets in.
 Are there any good ways of getting to the bottom of this? Any tricks to facilitate debugging? I know that the RTS can spit out all sorts of logs, but I have no idea about interpreting them, or even if it's a good idea to log for days before stopping.
 So is there any good guides/tools for tackling this kind of problem?

In my current workflow, I have bound org-store-link within my denote straight-use-package declaration because that's where I define other denote-related key-bindings and org-store-link has a denote: interface.
 When using that within a note created by denote itself, it works like a charm: I can just use the denote: type of link, a minibuffer selection is opened that shows the contents of my denote-directory.
 I tried to do the same in my todos.org file: org-store-link, denote: to link to a specific note. That did not work. After choosing the denote: type, I would have to manually enter the denote id, without completion and without minibuffer selection.
 I have no clue why that happens. Do you have an idea or a solution to this?
 Thanks a bunch, have a good day :)

 There are two things:
  
#1 ssh into Head Node. The cluster has login node but then I have to queue up for a node to do a big run. Then, I have to ssh into the (non-login) head node once slurm runs that. So, can I do this 'double ssh' using emac's gdb?
  load modules. gdb is on the cluster but a module needs to be loaded.
  
Is all this possible? It seems non trivial to do

 the Thompson book makes heavy use of GHCi. I do all my studying on my galaxy tab s6 lite tablet, so I don't have to lug around a laptop to the library and coffeeshops.
 is it possible to install ghci (including writing module files and loading them) on my android tablet? a quick Google search on this subreddit and Google, of [ghci Android], makes me think that I can't?

This library let's you construct dataflow graphs called data frames, i.e., computations on collections that can be evaluated lazily (on demand) and whose results can be materialized. The materialized versions can then be incrementally maintained, i.e., you provide inserts and deletions for the data sources processed by a dataflow graph and idf will update the results of the dataflow based on the changes to the input data sources (what elements got inserted and deleted from the data sources).
 The rationale is that is you have some large sorted list or hashtable that is the result of a non-trivial computation, it is faster to incrementally maintain the datastructure using idf if there are only small changes to t…]]></summary>

 I would like to have the ability to organize and create new project types in some way, like you can with Projectile , as shown in the Projectile docs to create a new project type:

 Maybe the built-in project and EDE could potentially fill this role, but maybe not. I'm curious about what y'all think. Allow me to share what I found while looking around some of the Emacs source code.
 EDE, Emacs Development Environment, has an interesting interactive function ede-new which allows you to go through prompts to specify a new project. However if you do M-x ede-new you'll find that there's only 2 project types, Make …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm currently writing a rewrite rule system for an eDSL. Here is a very simplified version:
 data Expre = A | B | X Expre Expre process :: Expre -> Expre process A = B process B = A process (X ex1 ex2) = X (process ex1) (process ex2) 
 Expre pretty much represents a tree with two leaf constructors.
 process has my rewrite rules for terms of type Expre. All it does is swap A and B around. I was wondering if there is a canonical, clean way to track each application of a rewrite rule? So, concretely tracking the changes of my expression: process $ X A (X B A) should spit out the following list of intermediate terms:
 1 X B (X B A) 2 X B (X A A) 1 X B (X A B) 
 The number in the front represents which rewrite rule was applied. This feels very much like a problem that has a generic solution using a typeclass/data structure/idea that I'm not aware of, so I was wondering if such a thing exists. 
 My handrolled solution looks like this, there has to be a neater way:
 process :: (Expre -> Expre) -> Expre -> Writer [(Int, Expre)] Expre process fn A = tell [(1, fn B)] >> return B process fn B = tell [(2, fn A)] >> return A process fn (X ex1 ex2) = do e1 <- process (\e -> fn $ X e ex2) ex1 e2 <- process (\e -> fn $ X e1 e) ex2 return $ X e1 e2 
 Called with runWriter $ process id $ X A (X B A) in GHC gives the desired result.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody! I'm really having a hard time trying to decide whether to learn vim or emacs. I'm not here to ask for suggestion or any kind of comparison between the two, don't worry. What I'd like to know is whether org-mode could be useful for a specific use case, which could make me lean towards doom emacs rather than neovim.
 From time to time I have to write documentation for software packages at work. While doing so, we like to have both a pdf version (using latex) to hand to our customers and an html (or similar) version to be stored inside the git repository of the project. To avoid having to write two different docs, we initially used markdown and a custom pandoc filter (for headings, frontpages and whatnot). The problem is that this approach is very limiting when it comes to cross-referencing, captions, and tables with cells spanning multiple columns or rows. Hence we switched to RMarkdown, but having to write R code for the sole purpose of properly handling a few images and tables is very frustrating.
 Do you think that org-mode could be used to solve the problem once and for all? I know that tables in org-mode are pretty powerful, but I don't know to which extent. Nor if the same syntax would be correctly translated both in latex and html as it is with simpler tables.
 Also, if any of you uses org-mode to write scientific papers (hence using different latex templates from different journals) in the STEMs, I'd like to hear your impressions.

 So, what I am trying is setting export EDITOR='emacsclient -t -a emacs -nw' in my ~/.zshrc.
 When I run $EDITOR it says zsh: command not found: emacsclient -t -a emacs -nw.
 I also tried export EDITOR="emacsclient -t -a emacs -nw" and export EDITOR=emacsclient -t -a emacs -nw.
 The first one has the same result, the second one treads -t like a command
 / It's a bit weird, because this is how it's recommended in the wiki: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsClient Maybe a problem with zsh? // yup looks like it, because this works in bash.

 What I want is pretty simple and I'm sure there's a solution this, but I wasn't able to find it.Basically, I want to list all TODO items under a certain heading. For instance:
 * Tasks ** TODO some stuff ** TODO some other stuff ** non todo stuff * Not tasks ** some non task stuff ** TODO Some todo, but not under Tasks heading 
 Now, what I would like to list in an agenda view is all TODO items under the "Tasks" heading, but not under the "Not tasks" heading. After running the custom command, it should be like this:
 ** TODO some stuff ** TODO some other stuff 
 I've been trying to get this to work with the search command, but could not get this to work. I'm a bit at a loss right now, so any help, would be really appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I write a lot of Terraform at work, and currently rely on PyCharm for autocompletion and other features.
 VSCode has LSP support using terraform-ls (the Hashicorp one), and it works decently, but I'm finding it hard to get used to VSCode's UX.
 My assumption with LSP is that all heavy lifting should be done by the language server. Why does Eglot + terraform-ls not work as well as VSCode's implementation? Not even some basic auto-completion. Anyone managed to get it working?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for the unclear title, my problem arises when using a combination of various Emacs features...
 ​
 I am working remotely on a supercomputing cluster, running Emacs on my machine, and using TRAMP to edit python files on the cluster.
 To my great surprise, this works quite well, and the REPL also works flawlessly, as apparently run-python (C-c C-p) detects this is a remote file, and use the corresponding interpreter on the remote.
 ​
 However, I realized the version of Python running on the cluster is not the correct one. Indeed, they use the module utility to provide multiple conflicting version of programs. This means that I have to run module load python3 before executing python3 to make sure I have the latest version.
 ​
 If I SSH into the cluster, this is not a problem, as I just added the module load line in my .bashrc. However here, I am not sure how to do it: this is not an interactive shell, so the usual dotfiles are not read (.bashrc, .profile and friends).
 ​
 Any idea ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm currently trying to build a small package org-inline-block that aims to provide a simple syntax for blocks (without begin/end) based on indentation (like plain lists). While it would be cleaner to properly extend org-element for the export part, I only plan to add a function to 'org-export-filter-body-functions.
 Here comes the function (simplified version that isolates the problem):
 (defun org-latex-inline-block (text backend info) "Manage inline block in LaTeX export, as part of body." (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex) (let ((case-fold-search nil)) (replace-regexp-in-string "\\([ \t]*\\)\\(\\(Question\\)\\( (\\([^()]*\\))\\)?\\.\\)\\(\\(.*$\\)\\([\n]\\(\\1[\t ]+.*\\)?\\)*\\)" (lambda (substr) (format "\\begin{question}%s\\end{question}" (org-inline-block-get-core substr))) text nil t)))) 
 with
 (defun org-inline-block-get-core (s) "Given >Question. abcde<, return >abcde<" (let ((case-fold-search nil)) (string-match "Question\\( ([^()]*)\\)?\\. " s) (if (> (match-end 0) 0) (substring s (match-end 0)) ""))) 
 Here comes the unexpected behavior: if I try to export "Question. Where is Brian?", it will be exported to "\begin{question} Where is Brian? \end{question} Where is Brian? ", and I can't guess where this duplicate comes from... Any idea ?
