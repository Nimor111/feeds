 OrgModeClockingXBar - See what you are working on ;-) (if using orgmode clocking)
 I designed a hack to see your clocked-in task on your bar.
 The hack is composed of a few elements, Emacs code that adds hooks for clock-in and clock-out, a Python script to process a file with the Emacs output, and a code for Xbar.
 I have been using this for 2 years, and it's pretty robust. I didn't have time to share it before.
 The code is not perfect, if you quit your Emacs, without clocking-out the content of the file will not be changed so you will not see any update on the bar (at least not till next clocking-in or -out)

 I want to use Emacs as alternative to Xcode since text editting capability of Emacs is so powerfull and I got used to it.
 It seems there are several ways to do that but each one has some issues.
  
lsp-mode is broken for swift over a year. 
 lsp-sourcekit ;; completion stops working after lsp server returns an error #3028
 
 company-sourcekit and SourceKittenDaemon doesn't work for .xcworkspace 
 Support for xcworkspace #73
 
 eglot doesn't officially support Swift and doesn't have instruction to get it working. 
 konrad1977's comment on Swift support? #825 seems promissing though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I've been muscling my way through the various dated on-line guides, and reddit help has been so key... thank you... I'm almost there ;))
 mbsync successfully gets my email into ~/.maildir/myGmail/
 mu info shows maildir as ~/.maildir
 Email is indexed, I can run mu commands and see emails, etc.
 TL;DR: Invoking mu4e in emacs then makes the [Gmail] structure under ~/.maildir rather than using the already existing ~/.maildir/[Gmail]. (The effect is I can go to unread email, but can't jump to inbox or any directories because they aren't where the mail is, they show all empty since they're the new dirs mu4e made.)
 I have no idea where this would be coming from since I thought mu4e is just going to use the mu info. Also I was going to try to re-init mu with ~/.maildir/myGmail, but can't figure out how the hell to do (and seems like it won't work for multiple accounts anyway). I can't seem to kill mu (can't find the process), but trying to init says it may already be running.
 If you can point me toward additional info that would be great. I'm on mac homebrew emacs and mu. (Much thanks to u/FrostyX_cz blog post on getting mbsync up).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to all,
 I had the following idea: use org-mode as a chat. For exemple, if you would like to do the following: chat with someone who doesn't know org-mode well, via org-mode.
 That is, he would just have to call commands like "reply to this message", where each message could be a heading, and each file a topic of discussion. The files would be in a folder that would be shared. This would largely mirror the layout of reddit replies. 
 Edit and precision : a person A would not have to be logged in to receive B's message, just like on reddit or any other modern communication medium.
 ​
 Also, the power of org-mode could be used: combined with org-babel, org-attach, org-roam etc... that would be really cool.
 ​
 Is there a package to do this? If so which one? If not, would someone like to do it with me? Is it a good idea to make a package or is there an easier way?

 I have a ZSA Moonlander keyboard. With their online configurator, I set up a key to run the Emacs macro "C-x b", that is "Press Ctrl-X, then press B".
 But when I use it, it emits "x" and "b" separately.
 I downloaded the source code for my firmware and it looks OK to me:
 case ST_MACRO_2: if (record->event.pressed) { SEND_STRING(SS_RCTL(SS_TAP(X_X)) SS_DELAY(100) SS_TAP(X_B)); } 
 Taps Right Ctrl with X, waits 100ms, then taps B. Which exactly what I want it to do.
 What am I missing? I tried inspecting the keyboard events and it still looks OK to me. Dump from evtest when I press that macro key: https://pastebin.com/fJp5kyR4
 Is it executed too fast for Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, first post here. I have been a happy emacs user since I knew about its existence and now I'm a even happier user of org. My question is about org's indent mode and custom themes. Apparently, org's indent mode creates the illusion of indentation by inserting dummy '*'s at the beginning of each sub-header, and making them invisible. When I switch custom themes, most themes do not consistently set colours in such a way that those dummy stars are invisible, that is, I guess, have the background colour. I am aware that custom themes cannot be undone by design, however, as a matter of fact, some themes do work consistently correctly with respect to indent mode, notably, all sanityinc's ones. Is it feasible to isolate the relevant feature of sanityinc's themes and replicate it in other themes to fix them?

 Emacs.bat:  wsl bash -c ". ~/.bash_profile && emacs %*" 
 (. bash_profile is needed to export variables for x server to work properly)
 %* is expanded to windows style filenames with \ instead of /
 I tried to work around this by passing these arguments to bash script:
 Emacs.bat:  wsl bash -c ". ~/.bash_profile && ~/.emacs.d/windows-open %*"  windows-open: ```
 !/bin/sh
 echo "$@" | tr '\' '/' # see how it expands
 emacs $(echo "$@" | tr '\' '/')
  and trying to run:  PS C:\Users\wisni> .\bin\Emacs.bat "te\st lmao"
 C:\Users\wisni>wsl bash -c ". ~/.bash_profile && ~/.emacs.d/windows-open "te\st lmao"" test ``` as you can see only the first word of was passed to the script (te\st) and \s was somehow escaped by the shell to just s.
 I had tried to use single quote instead of double quotes:  wsl bash -c '. ~/.bash_profile && ~/.emacs.d/windows-open %*'  but it breaks even more badly: ``` PS C:\Users\wisni> .\bin\Emacs.bat "te\st lmao"
 C:\Users\wisni>wsl bash -c '. ~/.bash_profile && ~/.emacs.d/windows-open "te\st lmao"' /bin/bash: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching '' /bin/bash: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file `` any idea how to do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm starting at a new large company shortly and I'll need to justify why I want Emacs on my computer.
 For context:
  
the new firm is a Microsoft shop - to the extent that "cloud" == "Azure" (only) and GNU Linux or Apple is not even a dream at the moment
 I'm going to be one of the grown-ups in the room, running a team of technical people, but not coders, I guess the closest concept is technology consulting (if any of my team has ever heard of Emacs I'll be surprised!)
 as a grown-up I'll not be writing much (any) code, and I'm guessing coders get VSCode, because, well, MS
 I code, so elisp will be invaluable to me to build all those little tools to actually GSD
 I'm not a windows person, so I don't have any starting points for windows-specific examples
  
So when I go in and say to tech that I want to install this currently non-approved "text editor", I want to be able to say that Emacs is so much more than an editor, but using an example that translates to a Windows tech support person.
 I thought of something like "Windows isn't just a way of displaying windows, it's an operating system" - but I'm not sure that suggesting I'm installing a whole new operating system is a good look on day one...
 Does anyone have a good way of describing (concisely) Emacs in an analogy?
 I've seen this link, but it seemed to get into arguments around web browsers and JS and answers that were for a full on discussion, rather than a quick justification like I need. Did I miss any other discussions that I should have seen before posting?

 I saw this approach many times in other Haskell projects so I’d like to know whether this is the correct approach when using map/filter/foldl. 
 ```haskell -- approach 1 -- does work, but why? append :: String -> [String] append = map (++"!") . words
 -- approach 2 -- does work -- append :: String -> [String] -- append line = map (++"!") (words line)
 -- approach 3 -- does not work -- append :: String -> [String] -- append line = map (++"!") . (words line)
 main :: IO() main = do print $ append $ "Hello World" ```
 The output is:  [“Hello!”, “World!”]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm usually programming in vscode or intellij during my working hours and wanted to make a slow switch to emacs for my side projects. Both of these options have a "find in files" keybind (ctrl+shift+f) which I use constantly to jump around at different areas. 
 Is there something like this for emacs? I'm on windows and have tried 'elgrep' but it just doesn't seem near as efficient as what I was using before because I have to set the directory, reg exp for files, reg exp to ignore files, etc etc... 
 Maybe there is some way to create a command to do this for me or a better/easier to use plugin out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE: You can see the quote below, but looks like google got rid of apps that sign in with "only username and password." So, wtf aside, what's the technique then? (looks like they didn't break legacy so this will only affect new setups). Thanks again.
 ​
 To eliminate possibilities and simplify I'm just sending my password in Pass "" in the .mbsyncrc. Everything installed via homebrew on mac. (following the System Crafters youtube setup instructions). The first error was:
 ---------
 ...
 Connection is now encrypted
 Logging in...
 Authenticating with SASL mechanism PLAIN-CLIENTTOKEN...
 Error performing SASL authentication step: SASL(-7): invalid parameter supplied: Parameter Error in /System/Volumes/Data/SWE/macOS/BuildRoots/d7e177bcf5/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/passwordserver_saslplugins/passwordserver_saslplugins-194/plain_clienttoken.c near line 195
 C: 1/1 B: 0/0 F: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0 N: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0
 ------------
 From (https://macowners.club/posts/email-emacs-mu4e-macos/) I added AuthMechs PLAIN to the .mbsynrc file (also tried adding SSLVersions and SystemCertificates no). After that the error is just:
 Connection is now encrypted
 Logging in...
 Authenticating with SASL mechanism PLAIN...
 IMAP command 'AUTHENTICATE PLAIN <authdata>' returned an error: NO [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Invalid credentials (Failure)
 C: 1/1 B: 0/0 F: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0 N: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0
 ------_
 But the password is verified correct so I'm very confused to be stuck so early. Thank for any light you can shed on this (or if maybe there is a better place to post this... its all about getting email into emacs). I also used the info in the mac link above to export my certificates for a root certificate, don't know if that would be related since I never quite groked certs.
 ​
 Thanks.

 I've been using emacs org-mode to organize my life and take personal notes for about 8 months now. It has taken over my life in the best possible way, and I'm currently trying to find a way to have it replace LibreOffice as my word processor. Does anyone have example configs or recommended packages for this?
 ​
 My two main requirements are checking for spelling and grammatical errors (checking grammar is particularly important), and the ability to make/edit rtf files so that my non-tech savy colleagues can open the files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering starting a London Haskell meetup, or reviving it if it used to happen but lost ownership.
 I've not been able to find anything active on meetup.com - but I also guess an FP meetup would be perfectly fine too (just also couldn't find many in London).
 In-person is important to me - I am as cautious as the next person - but I'd like to bootstrap something so that when everyone's comfortable in a room again, it gets healthier as a community.
 I've got maybe 5 years writing HS, more or less as my primary off-the-clock language, so I'm not the most qualified technologist here, but can definitely speak to some of my specifics (quirks with getting performant WASM from Asterius, fun quarantine games built on IHP, music gen, etc).
 I've never dabbled in meetups and I'm really missing a sense of community even though I work in tech (FAANG).
 So - please, any wisdom, all appreciated!
 (if I missed an already active one then job done - please just show me it :) )

 I'm on NixOS with packages aspell, aspellDicts.en, aspellDicts.de installed. When I switch to german dictionary in emacs 28.1 via ispell-change-dictionary and try to check a word with M-$, I get the following messages:
  
Starting new Ispell process /run/current-system/sw/bin/aspell with german dictionary...done
 ispell-init-process: Error: The file "/nix/store/96n79c5sfssmn24rpfy7gvsfxcw959k2-aspell-0.60.8/lib/aspell/german" can not be opened for reading.
  
I've set ispell-aspell-dict-dir (and also tried setting ispell-aspell-data-dir) to /run/current-system/sw/lib/aspell, where german.alias and other dictionary files like de.dat can be found. Unfortunately this does not have any effect, ispell.el still tries to open the dictionary via the /nix/store directory of the aspell package (not aspellDicts.de package!) like in the messages above.
 Does anyone have any idea how to fix that?

 I specially am curious on if there are ways to reuse some code and have less repetition, or to use some more advanced features, although I must say Haskell has helped to make developing this project and refactoring a pleasure! 
 The project is meant to replace sites like CifraClub or UltimateGuitar eventually, in a community driven manner. Help me realize the dream :) I plan to create some Docker image to more easily deploy, but I am open to all ideas and suggestions.
 I also learnt quite a lot about MongoDB but it's my first time using, so it might be noticeable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just seen the post related to the new release of Fourmolu and thought I have a look into it. 
 Unfortunately, it doesn't fit my style. However it reminded me that formatters existed (so far, I've been formatting everything manually for years) and it might be time to finally adopt one. I started investigating and the result is, they are plenty (too many ?), some which might be deprecated and none of them correspond to my style (I think).
 I mean I think because most of them are configurable and it may be possible that one with the correct configuration will fit. So my question is ; is there any formatter which will fit the following requirements (or the closest, I am even ready to modify it if needed).
 I'm pretty much only require list be aligned on (leading comma), but I don't want the formatter to add new line for me after an =. so
 myList = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] 
 (my prefered way) or 
  myList = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] 
 If I have myself started [ 1 on the new line.
 function call like this (when too long)
 function arg1 ( other_function x y ) arg3 
 I do record like this (or equivalent)
 MyRecord = MyRecord { x :: Float , y :: Float } 
 But the most peculiar thing I do is have a trailing let, ie
 my function a = let x = a+1 y = a+10 in x*y 
 and I can't find any formatter allowing it. I'm surprised nobody is doing it because it works really well. It's compact : save one line and one level of indentation and neat to read.
 The rest, I don't really care , I don't need import to be sorted or case to be aligned etc . In fact I just need the level of indentation to be correct : children of things (list element, argument, etc eee) all with the same identation, but first children inline with the parent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So I’ve been using Doom now for 1.5 year. 
 I use emacs daily for notes in org-mode, magit, dired and occasional Python programming, but without lsp support as I can’t get it working inside a dev container. 
 All of my “customizations” are just modules I enabled with corresponding flags in doom. 
 I really like the doom experience but I can’t help to feel somewhat stuck as whenever I get some lisp error or want to change something I’m just lost and have no clue what to do. 
 In all other areas of programming I would never accept this, but I just find it so difficult to reach the “next” level and don’t exactly know how. 
 I’ve considered trying a Vanilla eMacs experience for the sake of learning, but then all my productivity would be lost. 
 What was the best thing you did in order to advance to an intermediate level as a beginner?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 i haven't used Org / org-contacts for managing my contacts for years, and with so many other commitments on my plate, i no longer have the resources or interest to continue trying to maintain org-vcard, and deal with the data produced by the software of tech multinationals.
 org-vcard was my first Emacs package - i created it in 2014, even though i'd been using Emacs for decades by that point - and unfortunately, it shows. In recent times i've been trying to do some code cleanup, but to say that there are 'infelicities' - both within the code itself, and in terms of the UX - is an understatement.
 At one point i started doing some work to move to a parser based on the grammars defined in the three vCard specs (2.1, 3.0, 4.0, with differences between them significant enough to make trying to deal with them Less Than Fun), but that didn't get particularly far.
 i'd also toyed with creating an ELisp CardDAV library and refactoring org-vcard to make use of that, but that never eventuated either. (Partly, if i recall correctly, because when i first looked into doing this, there was a bug in Emacs' XML parsing; it got fixed, but the fix took a while to appear in an Emacs release.)
 If anyone is interested in taking maintainership, please contact me (Alexis) at the email address listed in the project repo.

Fourmolu 0.8 
 Added initial support for leading arrows
 Added new multi-line-compact option for people wanting to use {-| instead of {- |
 
 Fourmolu 0.9 
 Added support for putting let definitions on the next line instead of inline with new let-style option (and configuring whether the in keyword is left-aligned or right-aligned to the let keyword with the in-style option)
 Added support for outputting with unicode characters
 Leaves the where keyword in the module header where the user originally put it
 
  
As always, thanks so much for everyone who contributed. Really awesome work happening over here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I just got issued a new work computer and I'm not sure what the problem is.
 M-w does not work. M-x works, which would seem to indicate that the problem is not that windows is prioritizing the meta key for other operations outside of emacs.
 When I run describe-key, it doesn't register anything as happening when I press M-w.
 When I use M-x to find the kill-ring-save command, it shows M-w as being the assigned shortcut. And yet, nothing happens when I type M-w.

 Any ideas on whether the issue is with emacs or with windows, and how to address?

I've checked my config options, and I have ALL of the optional server capabilities turn ON and I've got `Company Clang Insert Arguments` set to `on'. I'm not sure what else to check. (Emacs 28.0.92 on Windows). 
 Second, is there a way to turn on completions for the class I'm working on without typing `this->` first? If I want a member variable and I don't remember the name, there doesn't SEEM to be something that lets me implicitly ask for just the class variables and functions. If I start a company completion, it gives me a much broader list of completions, which can be very handy, but usually the list is too big and generic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have some parametrised GADTs which, at some point, I need to be able to generally use. Here's one:
  data Entity (t :: EntityClass) where Entity :: EntityID -> SiteID -> EntityConfiguration t -> Entity t 
 I also have a Some type to hide the parameter:
  data Some (t :: k -> Type) where Some :: t k -> Some t 
 I can also hide the parameter using a forall:
  data EntityX where EntityX :: forall t. EntityID -> SiteID -> EntityConfiguration t -> EntityX 
 I have a function that wants to be able to generally use these parametrised classes (e.g. when getting them from a database):
  type Z = Some Entity -- OR type Z = EntityX instantiateFromRow :: (Int32, Int32, Value) -> Either InvalidEntityError Z 
 I'm encountering an issue when writing tests for instantiateFromRow (although I'm sure I'll encounter it elsewhere as well) in that I need to somehow verify that the result of this function is what I think it is (I'm using Hspec, for reference):
  instantiateFromRow (...) `shouldBe` expectedResult 
 The problem is that if I use Some Entity as the result type, then I have the problem that I need Eq instances for Some Entity, which I just cannot work out how to get right (I get lots of "cannot match type t1 with t2"), but if I use EntityX then I have problems with the forall t not matching the output of functions which do things like parse JSON instance FromJSON (Some EntityConfiguration).
 So I either need to find a nice way to:
  
extract the inner value from the Some existential (but this feels fraught with type difficulty in its own right);
 deriving / write Eq instances for Some Entity
 find a way to reconcile these type variables (which feels like a problem for which one needs dependent types at which point I'm both lost and screwed since Haskell doesn't really support them AFAICT).

 I need to occasionally edit Jason buffers indented with 2 spaces, when my default indentation is 4.
 However, incanting (set-variable 'tab-width 2) in such a JSON buffer has, to my surprise, no effect.
 M-x describe-variable says:
 tab-width is a variable defined in ‘C source code’. Its value is 2 Original value was 8 Local in buffer summary-fields.json; global value is 4 
 exactly as expected, but hitting tab, or even comma :-/ consistently aligns me with 4 space tabs, which is getting me down.
 C-h m gives me the mode:
 JavaScript mode defined in ‘js.el’: Major mode for editing JavaScript. 
 which also seems as expected.
 I'm running Aquamacs 3.6 GNU Emacs 25.3.50.1
 Thanks for any ideas or tips.

 Org mode is perhaps the first thing that comes to mind as a way to have this in emacs. However, org mode isn't directly extensible by the user. At least, I'm not aware of any API to define e.g. a new kind of plain list, with associated operations.
 Are there other packages that allow defining ad hoc user widgets in the same style? Recognizing patterns in bits of text, extracting info from them, and providing actions for interacting with them. This could very pair nicely with org.

 I understand that project.el is "new" and follows the approach when there is a .git folder and other heuristics to auto-determine what a constitutes a project. EDE is "old" and has a declarative approach.
 Yet EDE is prominently documented and has imenu-entries, suggesting newcomers to click and try.
 Is EDE using project.el under the hood? And if not: Wouldn't project.el warrant menu entries?

search for <keyword>
 do something (e.g., a macro) to the text at/near <keyword>
 press `n` to go the next occurence of <keyword>
  
and so on...
 This works great for buffers, but I wish there was an equivalent behavior of `n`/`N`, but for entire projects. I know you can use projectile to find and replace regexps, but I like the flexibility and ease of use of the `n`/`N` + macros flow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've started using org-roam to build my note taking system.
 I am wondering whether there is a recommended workflow for using org-roam to read source code managed by git?
 What I am imagining is that:
  
When I open a source code file/buffer, the notes I've taken before would show highlight in the buffer.
 I can read the notes I've taken, and travel from notes to source, under org-roam
 's help.
 The notes can record the git commit hash of the selected text if any. If I want to travel from notes to source like in 2.
 , it will show the historical file content when the notes were taken, if the file has changed.

I improve little by little :) I'm wondering what would be a good way to structure Haskell programs. Suppose I have a User data type and some other types. Here are some possibilities I think ok:
 1) Type definition, functions and instances in User.hs. 2) Type definition in Types.hs along with other types; instances in Instances.hs along other type instances; user functions in User.hs.
 Do you have any battle-tested method ? I did not find any article about that.

an integration between the open-games-hs framework and rllib,
in order to gain access to the entire Python ecosystem and train agents for games written in Haskell.
open-games-hs is a Haskell library and DSL for defining,
operating, and analyzing certain kinds of game-theoretic games. It comes
with a rich type theory and implementation that allows for the
specification of agent strategies as Haskell functions.
For some games, encoding strategies in Haskell is fairly simple. But one could
imagine another way: what if we could learn those strategies? Utilizing the
theories of reinforcement learning? Well, one idea might be to try and build

But I wanted to see if there was anything I'd be missing before I do that. The only things I can think of are
  
Aesthetics while editing - yes you can export with org in a pretty format of your choosing, but it seems like you don't have quite as much control over aesthetics while writing. I don't really care too much about this, just something I've noted
 Line wrapping in table fields - in Notion I make heavy use 2 column tables that have tens of rows, and line wrapping works seamlessly. It seems like org tables don't really support line wrapping. I read about a few possible solutions but they seem a bit like they are going against the grain. This is probably the biggest holdup that might stop me from transitioning
  
Is there anything else I'm missing? I don't care much about #1, but I'd also love to hear solutions to #2 if anyone has any.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering how I can use emacs lisp to change the way text appears in the buffer (without actually modifying the underlying text). Essentially I want to include a "label" of sorts. 
 Specifically, I create presentations using RMarkdown and xaringan (which use remark.js on the backend) in Emacs. Three dashed lines (e.g., "---") marks the beginning of a new slide. At every occurrence of these three dashed lines, I want to display the slide number. So the buffer will look like this:
 ```
  
Header for first slide
 content
  
Header for second slide
  
Header for third slide
 ```
 And what I want the the buffer to look like this:
 ```
 --- Slide 1
 Header for first slide
 content
 --- Slide 2
 Header for second slide
 --- Slide 3
 Header for third slide
 ```
 So after I type "---" with a line break, it will add the slide number. The trick is that I can't actually insert the text though because in order for xaringan to properly break slides, there cannot be anything after the three dashes, not even a line break.
 How can I do this? If I am in a git project, I can see that magit includes the "+" character at the end of the line without actually modifying the plain text, so this has to be doable, right?

 Launch Emacs (which I guess it is assumed should have a call to (server-start) in its init.el or .emacs), but only if osascript is present,
 Run emacsclient
  
Is that right? If so, I have two questions:
  
Exactly how does the "but only if" in my point #2 above work? I assume that if the which osascript fails, then the call to osascript -e never happens. But how is that done? Something to do with the && I presume?
 Why is the script author making only the call to oasscript -e conditional on a successful which osascript? Why don't they also gate the emacsclient line itself? (In other words why don't just they kill the whole script if the which fails?) I might have understood letting the emacsclient line still run, even if the which had failed, but only if the author had included a -a option for emacsclient. Then, even if the failed which did blocked the call to oascript -e which in turn meant there would be no Emacs launched (and so no call to start-server), still emacsclient could have launched the alternate editor it had been given using -a. But as it stands, it looks like emacsclient will still valiantly attempt to launch even though it is almost certainly doomed to failure through lack of an emacs server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reading through the eglot docs, it talks about how a lot of its functionality is exposed through the default emacs packages, and that's one of the reasons why eglot is also built in, so it can work better with the defaults.
 So my question is - if I use flycheck, am I gimping myself? Does eglot also seamlessly work with flycheck, ivy, etc. because they all secretly use the same data sources or something?
 It's also got me thinking, is flycheck way better than flymake? I kind of cargo culted my current set of packages.

 I run Windows Emacs and do most of my work there.
 On some occasions I need to run Cygwin and do some stuff there.
 What I'd like to do when in Cygwin is to edit a file in my running Windows Emacs.
 I tried calling emacsclientw.exe from the Cygwin shell and pass a Windows file path but I always end up with a new instance of Emacs.
 Is that something that I can get to work?

If I'm using company-files for file name completion but I already had a file name written down, the completion simply inserts the new file name, instead of replacing the old one:
  
"./some-folder/_some-file.txt" 
 "./some-folder/my-file.txtsome-file.txt" 
  
It would be nice if company was smart enough to remove the trailing file name. Is there a simple solution here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never quite figured out how to search for Info nodes reliably in Emacs. I understand that Emacs is self-documenting and that the Info system is very comprehensive, so I always try to use Emacs and Info to search for answers before resorting to a web search. However I sometimes find it quite difficult to find what I need which makes me feel like I'm missing something.
 I was reading the Emacs development mailing list this morning and came across messages about "EUDC", but I didn't know what that was. So I hit C-h i to run info.
 I first tried m to select a manual, but EUDC did not appear in this list. I assumed that it would be part of the Emacs manual, so I tried to select "Emacs" from this list but that too did not appear. I closed info and instead hit C-h r to run info-emacs-manual and I then searched through the list from m for EUDC but found nothing. I then tried i (Info-index) but again EUDC did not appear in the list.
 I then tried a (info-apropos) but again nothing was found for "EUDC". Finally I got somewhere with s (Info-search); this took me to a page "33.4.2 Mail Header Editing" which had a comment about EUDC at the very bottom. There finally I saw the text "see EUDC (eudc)" which was a link to the correct "Emacs Unified Directory Client" info page.
 As you can see, my method for finding the correct Info manual was far from optimal. My question therefore is, what is the correct way of finding manuals like this using Info in Emacs?

However, during cs setup, cs installed JDK version 8u292. It might not be a big deal, but when I start off with a clean slate, I like to run the newest of the new to be able to take full advantage of the latest features, should I feel like it.
 What's the "correct" way of changing the JVM version used by Scala, so I can use the latest version? Do I manually download and install the JDK of choice? Can one of the CLI tools do it for me, like NVM (Node Version Manager) for node?
 Thank you for your time!
 Edit: Understandably, when I didn't specify it, it's easy to assume I'm on linux, but I'm on Windows 11! Sorry for not including that in the original post, but I don't really think it matters regardless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Expand region may be my most used thing in emacs yet it's a bit frustrating out of the box. I know there's ways to 'advice' the command to expand in certain ways, there's 2 specific things I want:
 On assignments/expressions
 I'd like expansion to always select the expression first but it seems to work backwards e.g. with this region
 a = b[c] ^ 
 expanding again leads to this
 a = b[c] ^^^^^ 
 instead of
 a = b[c] ^^^^ 
 On vterm/truncated lines Assume that the screen ends at col 5 with this
 barbaz foobar\ qux 
 If the region is currently foobar but the actual full string is foobarqux, expand region will go back and select all the way to the top of the buffer instead of the remaining part qux.
 TL;DR How can I bias expand-region to select forward instead of backward? Also to stop on newlines and not default to the entire buffer when it doesn't seem to know where else to go?

 Sometimes if the ctrlf minibuffer loses focus for some reason (does not just happen when I use my mouse), it will remain open and I cannot use C-s or C-r again until I manually click on the minibuffer to focus it.
 I would have expected C-s/C-r to focus an existing ctrlf minibuffer if it existed, but they do not, and I could not come up with a good way to implement this myself.
 Is there a good workaround for this? Alternatives to ctrlf?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a question as described in the title. I'm working a lot with Kubernetes and because of the nature of it - a lot of YAML files.
 These files usually end being a YAML file with Go or helm templates, which totally breaks parsing of said file for with Flycheck. I do appreciate all the YAML structure hints and usual errors which Flycheck would catch - but I can't figure out a way how to stop whole buffer from highlighting if YAML file contains some go template logic - or similar. I'd say the same would be true if i.e. the file would be an ERB template of said YAML.
 For context, I'm using doom-emacs, although not sure if that matters, I'd be happy to configure this even manually if needed.

 Some comment on Haskell cryptonite library from the report:
  
The cryptonite library is considered state of the art for cryptography within the Haskell ecosystem. However, the library’s maintenance should be strengthened and its test coverage expanded, given that it is a language standard. If the project is still developed in Haskell, consider investing in or contributing to the library and performing a security audit on it.
  
SimpleX Chat v4.2 is released with group links and many other things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently fully committed to an efficiency oriented programming workflow/setup, switching to arch linux with a standalone WM and learning VIM movements and during this new era of my developer timeline I found out about Emacs and then Doom Emacs, I almost immediately went to Doom Emacs after spending only about 2 days in GNU/Emacs as I had heard about all the cool features such as evil mode and alot of speed improvements and I have so long really enjoyed using it and I am constantly updating my configuration for doom.
 However, when searching the web for help in configuring Doom Emacs because I want to use it as my main IDE and get rid of Intellij and VScode and in my search of doing so I realized that there was very little content on Doom emacs in comparison to GNU Emacs, my initial thought was that obviously GNU emacs has been around for 40 something years while doom is relatively new it makes sense, however I noticed that even recent videos from these couple of years still mostly feature GNU emacs.
 Is there some kind of advantage to using GNU emacs over more custom versions such as Doom? Maybe more customization, better performance? Or is there maybe some kind of inherent disadvantage to Doom?
 Also if anyone has any good resources on how to configure doom extensively please share them it would be appreciated :) 
 Edit: Thank you all for your feedback and clarifications, while reading through some emacs documentation I came along Chemacs and I will take the advice to watch the emacs from scratch series whilst being able to have my regular doom emacs setup on the side while working on my base emacs setup.

 I see the New Module wizard, and can add them as individual modules one-by-one - that sort of works, but only if the project has the "use sbt shell for" all unchecked - which is what I want since it gives me best experience on single-projects.
 With that thing checked in, the project just dissapears from the modules.
 How do you use/edit microservices and setup your favorite editor if you want them in a nice single view?

 I like the default fringe style "doom" provides, they show both flycheck and git-gutter. I just want to increase the width.
 Previously, I tried git-gutter-fringe but it overrides the flycheck fringe. I checked vc-gutter file, I have not got is it using git-gutter or git-gutter-fringe.

 This is a fast and asynchronous Git status information that may be used as an UI element, say, in eshell prompt or in mode line. Note, it depends on an external executable gitstatusd by u/romkatv.
 The package was just submitted to Melpa.

 I've on one side a Windows 11 machine with my VSCode.
 On another - remote - side I've a Debian 10 machine with all Haskell tooling installed (ghcup, stack...).
 I connect my VSCode instance to my Debian machine through SSH (with the remote extension).
 I added the "Haskell" extension (the Haskell LSP actually) to VSCode and I set the correct settings on my remote machine.
 The problem is when I try to use it on a new project, the HLS server tries to start 5 times but fails without any error.
 So after 5 attempts it just says it cannot start.
 Here are the last chunk of logs HLS sends to VSCode (4 identical chunks are sent before, I just put one for sake of economy of space):

This often leaves the reader with the impression that they have to unlearn practices and concepts they already know to adopt this new paradigm.
In this post I would like to try a different approach, not requiring any programming knowledge, but only the most basic intuition. We will build on high school mathematics, in the form of sets and functions, to provide a learning path to understanding functional programming1.

I want to run an async process and have both stdout and stderr display to the same buffer (as if it was run in a terminal), but I want to just store stdout to a variable/pass to a lambda for use in code. I don't see an obvious way to do this from the docs. 
 The two options I see are: 
  
I call make-process without the :stderr option, and both stdout/stderr end up in the same buffer, but a process filter can't discern between them. 
 I call make-process with :stderr, and I have to provide a separate buffer for stderr
  
What I want is the combined output to show in a buffer for informational purposes, but code parses and uses stdout. This is because the commands I'm running are long running and display progress in stderr. Am I missing some obvious way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My questions:
  
why doesn't to global mode activate globally?
 
how do I get it to do that for all non-special buffers?
 
 emacs version: GNU Emacs 29.0.50
 I mostly use emacs-client.
 This doesn't happen when I run emacs by itself or in a terminal emacs -nw
 I'm not doing anything to check if the daemon is running in my config.
 Basically everything runs the same code. 
  
Since version 27 emacs has a built-in display-fill-column-indicator-mode and a global version too. 
 Early in my init files, I create a text-mode buffer named *text* (naming is hard). 
 Later on I use (global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode 1) and when I open a new (non special) buffer sure enough there's a fill column indicator over at the right hand side. Same when I visit elisp files, python files, .. pretty much everything. 
 However in my generated *text* buffer and the *scratch* buffer there is no indicator. 
 When I run emacs -nw or plain emacs works as expected and both those buffers have the indicator. 
 With emacs-client though, in those buffers, the global-minor-modes does include global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode but local-minor-modes does not include display-fill-column-indicator-mode. 
 In contrast I also have 
 (use-package display-line-numbers :ensure nil :hook ((text-mode-hook . display-line-numbers-mode) (prog-mode-hook . display-line-numbers-mode))) 
 And indeed display-line-numbers-mode is active in both the *scratch* buffer and my own *text* despite not setting those hooks until after the *text* buffer even using emacs-client. 
 How can I get this behaviour in all buffers?

 I planned this as an addition to Cognitive Loads in Programming but it is written as an independent topic. My goal in this post has been to examine in-depth deductive and empirical as 2 distinct mindsets programmers have when coding and communicating. 
 I am posting it here as (1) a followup to Cognitive Loads in Programming, (2) because IMO it is relevant to the discourse about FP and Haskell in particular. 
 I hope you find it interesting.

It mostly just works if I call 'eglot' when working on an R file, and the linting is great (for the most part). There are two things missing, though:
  
Automatic file name completion (I can trigger it manually, but it's annoying)
 
Variable name completion after $, this one does not seem to work at all
 
 Does anyone know how to fix this?

 I have one journal file called mylife.org It has many entries like so:
  
** [2022-11-01] *** dream i dreamt of cybernetic sheep **[2022-11-02] *** dream I was in antarctica **[2022-11-03] today was meh. lots of wasted time *** dream I foiled a bank robbery 
  
I just want to export the *** dream headings into another org-mode file if possible. so that i can call it dreams.org which only has my dreams like so:
  
*** dream i dreamt of cybernetic sheep *** dream i was in antarctica *** dream i foiled a bank robbery 
  
How can I go about it in the simplest way possible? Granted I lose out on the dates, but even achieving this would be helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to emulate some features in TeXMacs, specifically how when you type "QQ" in TeXMacs, you get "\mathbb{Q}". It's really nice once you get used to it.
 I noticed abbrev-mode does basically what I want, but with a caveat: I need to insert a character before the expansion happens. So (with electric-pair-mode) I may have "$QQ|$" where | is my cursor. Then C-f afterwards does not do the expansion. This is a minor thing, but I feel like you can do a lot with this feature. I have looked through some source code (specifically abbrev.el/expand.el/dabbrev.el), and its seems detection of abbrev-table is built-in somewhere (like in the language modes themselves)? The last thing I'd want to do is add a hook to insert.
 Here is the code for abbrev-based expansion.
 (define-abbrev-table 'global-abbrev-table '( ("QQ" "\\mathbb{Q}" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ("ZZ" "\\mathbb{Z}" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ))

 I know he doesn't typically come over to Reddit, but I thought it would be worthwhile to let folks know that he's looking for some kind-heartedness right now. I think he's a treasure to the Emacs community and worth investing in.
 His public contact information is listed on his website: https://protesilaos.com/contact/ so I'll message him directly about what methods will work best and update this post with more info if I find out.

 When I do `customize-themes` and pick for example wheatgrass, my default background isn't exactly black. I do `customize-face` and set background to black, but it does not become black. It looks like the theme continues to override my customisation. How can I enforce the black background?
 This is in terminal emacs (nox).

 When I set the CPU governor to 'Power' (i.e. tend to keep clocks low) the clocks stay at 800 Mhz and pixel scroll precision mode is very laggy, even though scrolling on chrome or firefox is completely smooth. When I set the governor to 'balance power' or 'performance', the sensitivity of clocks to load improves - CPU clocks peak at 2.7 Ghz, the base clock, for the duration of the scroll - and the scrolling becomes smooth.
 I don't know whether anyone else has experienced this and I'd like some tips on where I should post this to attract attention from developers. It's not ideal that scrolling is so CPU intensive in the first place. Very grateful though, of course, for pixel-scroll-precision-mode!

 -, do you use 1 data dir or set separate dirs per top heading (category)?
 -, do you create heading per file or put several (many) files in single heading?

 if you could show small example of your typical usage it would be most helpful.

But the types of fromInteger and fromRational are fromInteger :: Num a => Integer -> a and fromRational :: Fractional a => Rational -> a . But then ((fromInteger 1) + (fromRational 3.14)) :: Fractional a => a , which means the 1 got routed through Integer by fromInteger into playing well with Rational, deferring to Rational. How is this happening? The invocation of a class' various type instances is understood -- once a hint is given, i.e.,
 λ> :t (1 :: Int) (1 :: Int) :: Int 
 but this won't work
 λ> (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) <interactive>:124:19-34: error: • Couldn't match type ‘Ratio Integer’ with ‘Integer’ Expected: Integer Actual: Rational • In the second argument of ‘(+)’, namely ‘(3.14 :: Rational)’ In the expression: (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) In an equation for ‘it’: it = (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) 
 Once again, the hint-free, naked literals are playing nice with each other. And yes, if Haskell is subbing in fromInteger 1 for 1 and fromRational 3.14 for 3.14 then yes, the whole class system is involved. But how is this managed? Examples I've seen so far are helped by relying on type inference hints to route things to the proper from*. But naked literals, then adding "unlike" naked literals is a type inference that goes deeper than I can fathom. It's leveraging the class world like I can't figure out but would really like to know. It reminds of functors maybe?

 ​
 When trying to install GHCup on a fresh Debian 10 server with the standard command:
 curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh 
 I get the following error (after answering "Yes" to most of the 3 questions the installer asked):

 Without more details in the logs about what happened..
 Given that:
 - all dependencies requirements are ok
 - I installed GHCup hundreds of times without any problem
 I don't understand what could be the problem at this stage...
 Any help? :)

 Consider for example the function f x y z = (y && z) || x. Suppose I want to prove the property that "if x is True, then the value of f x y z is independent of y and z". In other words, "f True is a constant function".
 My idea for proving this property is to extend the Bool types to a kind of 3-valued logic similar to Maybe Bool, but with different semantics. You could call it, say, data Partial a = Actual a | Unknown. The semantics of Unknown follow the truth table e.g. at this Wiki link. Then you could do a calculation:

 But with that, I would love to find a way that when I have to reschedule an event, Emacs would automatically reschedule everything else, e.g. due dates, time allocated, difficulty. Basically, I'm asking for SkedPal (https://skedpal.com/) as an Emacs mode. I hate to pay continuously for software and would love to stay within the Emacs ecosystem, but this is on the point of me desperately needing any possible solution.
 What's the best way to do this? Is there something already available? Could I learn Elisp and code it myself? Would someone be willing to code it?

 At university, you get taught the basics of programming in the world of OOP, such as data structures, implementation scheduling, algorithm analysis, etc. I'm interested in finding what kinds of materials are available from the POV of the functional paradigm, be it technical or more of a case studies.
 I'm interested in continuing my education one day, although, I'm not sure whether I want to remain in pure mathematics or look into specific fields in the comp sci domain.
 If anyone here has any interesting blogs or academic materials, I would be very interested to be linked to some resources for my own reading. Thanks!

 Dear all,
 As we are preparing the next release, we should make sure that no critical bugs go into the release version of Org.
 I think I have closed all the straightforward bug reports listed in updates.orgmode.org and a number of unconfirmed bug reports that were left without response.
 However, there is still a number of bugs that either require further discussion or difficult to fix (for me). Some reports may also be missing from my records.
 It would be helpful if you can help with further feedback or fixing the bug reports listed below. Especially the reports marked with [*].
 Also, if you know some bug report that is not listed below, but important to fix before the next Org release, please let me know in the reply to this mess…]]></summary>

Mainly pragmatism :-). I figure that if I reference a note a lot in other notes, the information in the note being referenced is "more valuable", since I keep coming back to it. I don't do tagging, and structure notes are a later addition to my Zettelkasten, and are treated as regular notes, but with a lot of outgoing links. So those two are out too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya, I recently came across the following articles which discuss GitHub actions that create GitHub releases with that include downloadable binaries for Haskell programs: - https://vrom911.github.io/blog/github-actions-releases - https://kodimensional.dev/github-actions
 Unfortunately, a few of the components used in them are deprecated (like set-env and set-output) are deprecated. I've tried reading a related article about environment files, to no avail. I'm likely not proficient enough with GitHub CI to update this myself. 
 Anyway, I was hoping someone had recently used GitHub Action to automatically: - build on linux, macos, and windows - upload artifacts to a GitHub Release
 I'd also be amenable to a similar setup in GitLab if that's been done, as I'm not really tied to GitHub.
 Bonus points if it supports static binaries on Windows, but not a deal breaker at all. I've figured out how to do static builds on Linux, and my understanding of Mac is it's nigh impossible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone gotten this to work? So far I used a hydra including this snippet to resize windows. As many others I wanted to try out transients for my keybindings. In particular I liked that I could use an infix toggle state to switch between windmove and resizing using the same keys (I guess I could also bind the toggling key to switch back and forth between different hydras too). I have used the same functions as the hydra in the link. Namely these:
  (defun hydra-move-splitter-left (arg) "Move window splitter left." (interactive "p") (if (let ((windmove-wrap-around)) (windmove-find-other-window 'right)) (shrink-window-horizontally arg) (enlarge-window-horizontally arg))) 
 The resizing more often then not fails however, because the transient window in and on itself is fixed-size and does allow neither explicit, nor implicit resizing. So every Splitter that touches the transient can't move and the command fails silently. Since this is probably a common application does somebody know how to get this to work?

For example if I have multiple expressions of the form f1 f2 f3 ... fn a1 a2 ... am which work on lists. In this case all of them will be stored in memory and if I am using only one element from each expression at a time, others will not be evaluated and the complete logic chain would stay in memory.

I value debugging friendlyness very much (do you use traditional debugger with breakpoints etc in the functional world, or how is it done there? ).
 It can be elm or some haskell near language too.

Perhaps more accurately, I'm trying to improve my terrible Scala and wanted to know the right way to try to build an app in Scala that could do what I am currently doing using Python and Boto3. Querying S3, Step functions, etc. etc.
 Wanted to know here whether anyone could point me to how they're using Scala and AWS (or course Scala and Spark are how I generally use Scala, but now I want to use it for more and perhaps move some of my Boto3 stuff into Scala - mostly for learning purposes).
 Also, if I create an "app" that can run from the CLI, I will obviously have to also create some shell script to run the app because I need to invoke Java and all. Is there a better way of doing that?

 I started watch how to build you custom config from scratch and I tried and I like it so much. Adding packages one by one after I know they are useful for me. I learned a lot more than the 6 months with doom and spacemacs.
 Now, I want to setup evil keybinding like doom and space emacs but it's overwhelming and confusing. I tried looking into space/doom configs that involve packages I use in but I found a lot of custom functions there's no logic to the keybinding.
 My question, is there any reference that I can use as help or template in my journey to setup evil keybinding. P.s: I don't mind templates for emacs binding as long the logic is explained so I can follow the same or adapt.

At some point, it became clear that even if the sequential execution of the requests is comparable with other editors the the fact that (almost)no IO work is performed when emacs UI thread is busy ultimately chokes both the server and the client(especially for the single-threaded servers).
 Here it Emacs fork https://github.com/emacs-lsp/emacs based latest(?) release 28.1 branch that uses separate thread(s) for processing json and communication with the language server thus taking more than 95% of the load off the main UI thread. In addition, it reduces the GC pressure because some of the objects never reach the lisp layer. Compile it just like a normal emacs(make sure to have --with-modules configuration flag) and it should work with the latest and greatest lsp-mode. 
 The code is still not extensively tested and works only for Linux/Unix. With the help of https://github.com/606u we are going to add Windows support as well.

I recently discovered the Zettelkasten method and am curious, if this method would be of any use to me. I'm doubting because all the explanations I see online or in books about that method using Zettelkästen are in the field of sociology, psychology, personal development etc., and I can see very well, why the method would be useful in those fields, where finding new ideas is a crucial part of the work done there. But I didn't find a single YouTube video or alike made by scientists about that method.
So I wonder, if a Zettelkasten could be useful, as well, in fields where it's much more about facts than insight. I mean, in those fields it's much less about "discovering unexpected relations" and "coming up with new ideas", but much more about collecting data and facts and pu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to generate a static site from all my org notes. The notes are currently a mix of plain org and org-roam notes and dailies.
 So far I've tried using ox-hugo to generate everything using this snippet (using doom emacs' doomscript):
 ``` (defcli! export-org (file) (require 'doom-start) ; load doom user config (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect file) (setq org-hugo-base-dir "org-hugo-dir") (let ((org-id-extra-files (find-lisp-find-files org-roam-directory ".org$"))) (org-hugo-export-wim-to-md))))
 (run! "export-org" (cdr (member "--" argv))) ```
 Basically I loop over all org files calling this script on each one, ox-hugo however fails with an error:
  Error: [ox-hugo] my-file.org: The entire file is attempted to be exported, but it is missing the #+title keyword 
 Apparently ox-hugo requires at least a #+title property in every file... Problem is, I have hundreds of files and it would be quite tedious to add a title to every single one of them.
 So far I've considered these options:
  
I'm possibly missing some ox-hugo/hugo configuration
 Programmatically adding #+title to every file
 Switching to a different export mechanism altogether
  
Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you all!

 Couldn't match expected type: [String] -> b with actual type: [b0] * Possible cause: `(<*>)' is applied to too many arguments In the first argument of `(<$>)', namely `insert <*> ["hi", "hello", "hello world"]' In the `keyValues' field of a record In the expression: HMap {keyValues = (insert <*> ["hi", "hello", "hello world"] <$> (initialize 10))} * Relevant bindings include myMap :: HMap [b] (bound at <interactive>:43:1) 
 I understand there's a type mismatch here. I've tried changing the type that my functions call. In the basic implementation of a functor for a function type, the syntax seems correct. Am I understanding this wrong?

 My Emacs running LSP and not getting parameters upon choosing a function
 Technically, I have two questions but the one in the title is far more important to me.
 So my understanding is that LSP/Company can be made to insert the parameters of a function so that the parameter names are already filled out for you; while from the no-longer-supported company-lsp, the below Gif demonstrates the relative idea:
 Company Mode inserting the parameters of the function chosen
 But, as you can see from the end of my video, my Emacs doesn't insert those parameters, just giving me an empty set of parentheses.
 My setup isn't terribly complicated, sticking to general defaults:

I'm at the halfway point. After finishing this book what should I learn? I am planning to learn typeclassopedia for higher theory (such as monad transformers). But I'm concerned that even after i do all the programs in this book. I wouldn't be doing any "real programming". Meaning, i feel like these are toy problems and i should find programs with actual substance(grounded in real world usage) so I can gather real experience. What site or book will have real coding challenges that will help me grow and mature as a programmer. My background is cybersecurity and I'd love to learn server side coding to improve my web security knowledge. Even tho this is my preference I don't mind coding a parser combinator or something else that will help me. Tldr - what kind of practical programs should i code to progressively learn Haskell back end coding and land a job.

I realised there's an 'Introduce Yourself' category in the forum, so I thought I'd say hello.
Now that I'm thinking about it, I can't remember how I discovered the Zettelkasten system. I only know that I somehow found it online a few months ago, while researching note-taking and study skills. I'm not originally from Germany, but I live here now, so the German-sounding name 'Zettelkasten' piqued my curiosity when I first saw it.
The reason I was researching in the first place, is because I knew I would start studying for a Masters in October of this year. My Bachelors experience was way too ad-hoc. I just didn't have a good system. Knowing that I wanted to have a much better experience studying for a Masters, I was determined to get a good note-taking and connection-building system in place before my studies started. After some reasearch, I realized that the Zettelkasten method was what I needed, and I've been using it actively for about a month now.
It's still too early yet to have many links between notes, but I'm starting to build a nice network, one note at a time.
The forum history has already helped me, both to understand the method and to get ideas for my own personal implementation. I look forward to future learning with you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a big Emacs fan and have loved using it for years but can't help but think there's a lot of jankiness in various language modes.
 Syntax highlighting in general is slow. Tree Sitter is an interesting potential replacement and I got it working with some languages but I got lost trying to install a language manually - ex vue tree sitter.
 Indentation can be unexpected. For example, say you are a PHP developer and you decide to try Emacs. The first thing you'd do is install some sort of PHP support, right? So you'd likely go to php-mode.
  
This is how php-mode highlights and indents my code by default.
 On VS Code, here is how it indents and formats the same code almost out of the box. Just had to install the PHP formatter. Just works.
 So then on your Emacs PHP journey you'd try to look for a better mode so you'd install web-mode and be happy because it formats it as expected. But I've experienced situations where web-mode would format in an unexpected way or syntax highlighting bugs out so I'd have to re-run M-x web-mode.
  
I seem to experience this a lot. A language mode that's just has the janky kind of feel. I also wish there was more of a standard in how things were done. As an example, several language modes define their own variable for tab width. I do understand this is a project that's been around since the 80s so cruft is to be expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am again finding myself experimenting with a graphical view after watching Bob Dotos Video on how to use Obsidian to write an essay. He seems to have a quite young Zettelkasten or at least does not make use of connection like I use. With a depth=2 a local graph by my Zettelkasten looks like this:

This is pretty typical when I browse my Zettelkasten and I am not able to get value from it. Of course, I am not practiced in using a graph view and my practice is by no means informed by a graph view. So, that could be confounders.
So, I find myself at a strange tension point: I really like using visual structures for my own Zettelkasten work. This is an example (actually from the book):

But whenever I run into the graph view I find myself unable to make it work.
I am not willing to stop challenging my position on graph view yet. I have a gut feeling that there is a blind spot I am not aware of. But I am confronted with a similar issue like many people it seems: There are no genuine demonstrations out there but just mock examples. Bob's video is a very concise demonstration on how writing with a Zettelkasten can be realised. I recommend to watch it to enrich your perspective. But the youth of his Zettelkasten makes the graph view part not applicable to my own Zettelkasten.
I filter methods and techniques by their longevity. And if the graph view cannot show its power with older and more developed Zettelkastens I don't think it is very promising to get into it. I want to concentrate my time and effort on methods and techniques that scale.
So, my question is: Are you aware of examples of graph view being used for more older and complex Zettelkastens?
Additional thought: Perhaps, the graph view is suited most to develop underdeveloped parts of the Zettelkasten?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first this was gonna be a question, but I looked a little further and realized the subtleties:
You ever notice in the two ZKs Luhmann worked on he indexed notes in both of his boxes 1-N?
Ex. So, a card labeled 1 or 1-6 can essentially be found in both boxes.
What's different, fascinatingly, is how he wrote them.
In his first ZK, we saw him use a comma "," (or in English, the period ".") to branch his notes, but with the second one he used the slash "/". That way he can account for notecards 1.6 and 1/6 to co-exist in his wider note-card system.
Luhmann probably would have changed it up if he wanted in a digital system, but I cannot blame him for taking the easy way out in that switch up. It was a good way to start over but leave no zettels behind. With that being said, even if he lived a lot longer, I'm not sure he would have opted to start a 3rd physical box.
(Rather minor, but I wasn't sure if this fits more in "Workflows" or "The Zettelkasten Method" category. It was kind of a toss up for me.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all sorry for a long question that probably has an obvious and short answer.
 I'm working through the idea that you can get to the Comonad typeclass, and its NonEmptyList instance, just by roughly considering the analogy between a category of CoKleisli arrows and turning it into code. In other words extract is extract :: w a -> a and compose is compose :: (w a -> b) -> (w b -> c) -> (w a -> c). Now you can rearrange to get extract and duplicate, and add Functor's fmap.
 What I'm having a hard time with is that to implement compose for NonEmptyList is that if you start with a w a you can apply the first CoKleisli to get the b, but to get a w b to plug in to the next function you need to sort of conjure duplicate from thin air. Once you have duplicate you can go ahead and implement the NonEmptyList Comonad we are all familiar with, which "duplicates" the incoming list to its list of itself and its tails.
 The question is, isn't there a simpler, but trivial and uninteresting implementation of compose here (and hence for extend also) that instead of duplicate, simply takes the head of the NonEmptyList. As far as I can tell this implementation is also lawful as a Comonad. I am missing a satisfying way to express that the way duplicate is implemented is somehow "the right and obvious way".

 Is there some detailed documentation of how to setup flymake with different languages?
 I used this but I must be missing something.
 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/flymake.html 
 I have flymake-php installed and php-mode.
 I can start flymake with flymake-mode and get it in the menu.
 But the check does nothing, after I put in deliberate syntax mistakes in the php file.
 I tried flymake-php-load as well but that also does seem to do nothing for me.
 A flymake-running-backends also shows me nothing, which makes me think it is not really running actually or knows which backend to use.
 Do I need to install a language server or something? Or if there is perhaps an in depth guide. 
 Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I am thinking about making a set of foot pedals for Emacs. I've looked into it before and I know different people used them differently but the impression I got was that your feet are too slow and too desynced from your hands to make it worthwhile (at least without significant practice). 
 My motivation stems from my left hand getting pretty overloaded, making some sequences of C and M impractical. For example, I struggle with using binds like C-c <any key> because I tend to hold down the control while I press the next letter, so I get C-c C-<that key>. 
 So my idea would be to have pedals for priming the next keystroke to have a C or an M. So I can press the Cpedal, then hit c <any key> and get C-c key. The pedal would then need to be released in order to register another C. There would be one pedal for C and one for M. 
 I was wondering if anybody had any experience with foot pedals and how useful (or useless) they were in your workflow. Have you ever used footpedals? If so, what did you use them for in Emacs? Did you have any use for them outside of Emacs? Were they comfortable? 
 Anything helps!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm attempting to implement a very basic hashMap . The goal is to just append strings to a list at an index that we receive from the hash function.
 data HMap = HMap { keyValues :: [[String]] } deriving (Show) hash :: String -> Int hash myString = ((length myString) * 2) `div` 3 initialize :: Int -> [[String]] initialize n = replicate n [] insert :: String -> [[String]] -> [[String]] insert nothing xs = xs insert s xs = newList where newList = before ++ [s:x] ++ after (before, x:after) = splitAt (hash $ s) xs 
 This is the implementation. My approach is to replace the current nested list inside a hashMap object. It doesn't help to think about this in an object-oriented style but it makes sense to me this way.
 I run the following commands and get the following back. I don't understand why the list is unchanged. I assume it has to do with the method of using splitAt to insert a new list of strings where the split is occurring. I'd like some insight as to what is happening here and maybe alternative solutions if possible. 
 Many thanks in advanced friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if I did something weird to cause it, but I kept having problems with SyntaxError: invalid syntax - IndentationError: unexpected indent when I tried to run python source blocks. The problem came from the auto-formatting occasionally throwing spaces on a line in a way that made the interpreter freak out.
 I couldn't find a solution, so I came up with this:
 lisp (add-hook 'org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook (function (lambda () (replace-regexp-in-region "\s+\n" "\n" (org-element-property :begin (org-element-at-point)) (org-element-property :end (org-element-at-point))) nil))) 
 It chomps spaces at the end of lines which fully eliminates them from the lines that were causing problems. (it does it for all languages and alters the contents directly. I'm okay with both those things)
 I did a write up with more details and notes
 It took me a straight 8 hours to come up with the solution. Because I'm interested in seeing how other folks work I decided to post my notes from the endeavor. It's mainly just a bunch of sequential code snippets as I try to home in on the solution
 I'm still new to this. If you see something wonky or dangerous, please let me know

 for few months now I am working on my hobby Yesod project - site for teaching physics. So far I managed to implement everything I tried to and I found Yesod amazing.
 However, I am starting to have my doubts if I should keep at it or go rather with something more mainstream (I am looking at django currently). And if so, what do you recommend? I plan to make this my life-long project, so its not something I want to ditch after a year and if, by some chance, it becomes sucessfull, I do have a lot of pretty complex plans for it, so future maintainabiliy and extensibility is also a consideration.
 Here are my concerns:
 1.) Haskell currently seems to me like a botomless pit of learning. Now, I do enjoy learning it, however I would like to soon shift my main attention from learning program…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I am relatively new to this subject and thought that it would be wise to debug my thinking before progressing too far. I am having difficulty with topics and connected zettels......
From what I have read the Luhmann system:
If the above is mapped onto a digital zettelkasten, then:
The unique id becomes, say YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm
The link to an already existing topic is a wikilink
The direct link to another zettel is a wikilink
The keywords are tags
My question: assuming the above is correct, then what means within a digital zettelkasten is typically used to assign topics to the top level zettels? As keywords are tightly tailored and the top level topics must be broad by their nature, so using tags for both would be confusing.
Thanks for feedback]]></summary>

Unfortunately I only have very limited experience with Haskell and I never worked with it professionally so I cannot answer this for myself. I’m asking those who has more experience with Haskell. Did you ever see a codebase that was architected so badly that it was beyond repair or the new business requirement were just not compatible with it and it had to be rewritten? How true is that you can still reuse most of the business logic because it is ultimately pure? I’m talking about drastic architectural changes in large programs or complete rewrites.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I remember there was a library posted here some time ago that would convert between case classes if one's fields was a subset of the other, using macros.
 I would like to use it to do something like this ```Scala case class Task(id: Long, description: String) // Sql-saved class case class Comment(id: Long, taskId: Long, comment: String) // Sql-saved class
 case class TaskDTO(id: Long, description: String, comments: Seq[Comment]) ```
 And be able to split incoming DTOs into a Task that is easily storable in the DB and the list of comments that will have foreign keys to the task.
 Does anyone know the name of such a library? Or maybe have some pointers as to how to do it differently? (I considered the DTO just being a class composing the task and comment list as fields, but that feels wonky)

 Currently on the higher functions chapter, and could use some help please.
 I cant seem to wrap my head around what happens under the hood during currification. I looked through all the posts about it on here and read on the wiki and other websites but some things are still unclear to me.
 let's say we have a function add 2 3 4 when going through the process of curryfication, we get addTwo first, which returns a function that we can pass the parameter 3 to to get addTwoThree and so on.
 What I would like to know is what do the functions addTwo and addTwoThree do essentially?
 Do they return anything ? Or are those specifics in machine language and we dont know what goes on behind the scenes ?

 I'm not sure what's happening, but when using Emacs inside Tmux, I can't type an asterisk? Instead, the minibuffer says "M-O j is undefined". Anyone know what this actually means?
 Edit: I'm using uxrvt, but the same happens in xterm.
 Edit 2: Ok, at least I have a work around - holding shift and it works??!
 Edit 3: Turns out it was urxvt that was breaking. Switched to Alacritty and everything worked

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wish to record my exercise performance, but I cannot bring my laptop with me to the gym and record my performance nor do I wish to write it down and then insert it into my fitness.org file since that sounds cumbersome.
 My current process is to use Orgzly and sync my fitness.org file with my phone and I simply record everything at the gym from my phone as the following example with separate headings for each exercise:
 * Pull Ups 2022-10-21,5,10,10,15,20 2022-10-31,10,10,15,15,20 * Bench Press 2022-10-24,90,95,100,110,100 2022-10-28,95,100,100,110,100 
 I did attempt to use tables, but they don't look easy to use in Orgzly so I am currently doing the above since it is easy to input into Orgzly on my phone. However, now that I have collected several months of data for all my exercises, I wish to produce a graph of my progress for each of the headings and I am unsure how to do this in the same fitness.org file since I recorded my data as csv instead of in an org table. In addition, I was also wondering how to plot the same data from multiple headings into a single graph using my above format? I am curious to see what others are doing and if there is a better way to track performance that can sync with my files on my computer while being in a format that is easy to work with.

Recompiling all the modules each time would be extremely time-consuming and disrupt the programmer’s workflow.
Therefore, build tools are careful to avoid recompiling files if they

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been thinking it'd be nice to have this feature, and it shouldn't be too hard to implement. But before I go and start working on it (which wouldn't be in a while, because of previous obligations), I want to check if there's already something that does this, or comes close.
 Here's the behavior I'd like: with a simple command, I can open a new buffer that shows me a "cheatsheet" with all the keybindings I've saved before, along with their command-name and a brief description.
 Additional nice features would be:
  
ability to group keybindings by modes
 ability to filter by the current active mode(s), so that only keys/commands related to it are shown
 ability to save keybindings interactively
 ability to save keybindings easily from a mode's keymap. Something like: in the *Help* buffer's description of the mode, select any commands, and save them to the cheatsheet
  
Often it is enough to do a quick describe-mode to find the name of the function I'm looking for, but I think this feature could be particularly helpful for major modes like magit or org, which can have quite complex keymaps. It could also help people who are just starting out with Emacs.
 Do you know if a feature along these lines already exists?
 I found this cheatsheet package that comes quite close, although it lacks some of the features I'd like and (most importantly) does not automatically save cheatsheets between sessions. I haven't taken a good look at the code there yet, but I think I might use it as my starting point.
 Would people be interested in this features? Any advice/critique is appreciated :)

 I use God Mode on Emacs (vim-like modes) and I want to exit it when the comment-dwim command doesn't comment out a region, only when it does and indented comment or a comment in an empty line, so that I can write afterwards, without having to press esc.
 ​
 Maybe there is some way to add the god-local-mode-pause function (the function to get into "insert mode", so as to say) to any of the comment related functions, however, I don't really know elisp, so any help is much appreciated.
 Tl;dr: is there any way to adhere a function to another so that when I execute one, with its name, it does another one as well?
 Edit: never mind, just learned what advising functions are for.
 The code I ended up with :
 (defadvice comment-indent (after comment-indent-after activate) (god-local-mode-pause)) (defadvice comment-add (after comment-add-after activate) (god-local-mode-pause))

 Below is my program. Here is how it is supposed to work:
  
The program is based on an MVar quitFlag that is supposed to act as a flag: the main thread is a loop that exits if and only if quitFlag is nonempty.
 The program first launches a thread that counts up starting from 0 (see countingLoop) and writes into the flag once it gets past 1000. It also prints every number it counts.
 The main thread just loops indefinitely until the flag is set, at which point it just exits.
  
All I get is a program that never exits and prints nothing on screen, whereas I would expect it to print the first 1000 numbers and then exit.
 module Main where import Control.Monad (when, void) import qualified Control.Concurrent as Cc main :: IO () main = do quitFlag <- Cc.newEmptyMVar Cc.forkIO . void $ countingLoop quitFlag 0 runUntilNonEmpty quitFlag -- | Prints integers; once we get past 1000, set the flag countingLoop :: Cc.MVar () -> Int -> IO () countingLoop flag n = do when (n >= 1000000) $ Cc.putMVar flag () print $ "n == " ++ show n countingLoop flag (n+1) -- | Run in a loop that only ends once the flag becomes nonempty runUntilNonEmpty :: Cc.MVar () -> IO () runUntilNonEmpty flagVar = do flag <- Cc.isEmptyMVar flagVar when flag $ runUntilNonEmpty flagVar

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to make a minor mode for quickly entering text containing accents or diacritical marks. In this mode, I would replace the keybinding for each alphabet key with a prefix map that is only defined for the number keys. For example the keybinding for the 'a' key could be defined as:
 ﻿(cl-loop for ch across "ąäàáæåâãǎα" for ind from 0 do (define-key quick-accent-mode-map (kbd (format "a %d" ind)) `(lambda () (interactive) (insert-char ,ch)))) 
 So if the user typed "a1", "ä" would be inserted into the buffer. But if the user typed "a" following by anything other than a digit, I would like the prefix map to have a "default" action that simply performs the actions that would result in the absence of the prefix map. So if the user types "ad", then, for a typical text-editing major mode, "ad" would be inserted into the buffer.
 Is it possible to define a default action for a keymap to achieve this behavior?

 I have configured a bigger line spacing because I like to have spacing between lines to increase readability.
  (setq-local default-text-properties '(line-spacing 0.50 line-height 1.50)) 
 I use LSP peek to show references and definitions but, since I'm not using the default line height, the peek panel bottom most of the time is not visible because (I guess) wrongly calculates the panel's height.
 Is there a way to customize de panel position and/or size so I can adjust it to my config?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Zettlers,
I am currently reading the Artikel The Two Definitions of Zettelkasten and am just a couple of hundred words in. @chrisaldrich contextualises the Zettelkasten Method within the bigger picture of using practices that seem to have something in common. I am perfectly happy to admit that I do the very thing that Chris is pointing out: My starting point it the article by Luhmann and while I am aware of the history Zettelkasten Method I never saw much practical value from reading the historical use cases.
I, myself, am a pretty non-nostalgic character. My passion for the Zettelkasten Method is fueled by exactly two motivations:
Improving my personal toolbox for knowledge work.
Generating tools to help other people to improve their toolbox.
I see this as an advantage because I have little incentive to lose myself in tweaking tools or spending time on the tool for fun and joy (nothing wrong with that if you do because it aligns with your own goals, of course).
The downside of this utilitarian approach is that it creates a blind spot which can be a source of fallacies.
So, the question is: What did you learn from the history of the Zettelkasten Method? What is there to be found what is missing in the current collective thinking in the internet?
Live long and prosper

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On GitHub, a user proposed to change "ghost" to "mind":

  
Changing ghost into mind. The mind refers to the mental frame, while ghost is the soul of a dead person.


In reaction to that, I wrote the first commentary to the translation:
The Zettelkasten as the ethereal ghost that hides in plain sight
In German, "Geist" means both "mind" and "ghost". The question spelled out could be something like "Can the mind of the Zettelkasten be observed?" Or something like that. So, why "ghost" instead of "mind?"
There is great anime film titled "Ghost in the Shell". It is quite a philosophical movie that asks the question: If your consciousness can be moved from your body and brain to machine are you still considered a human or will you become a computer program? One possible answer could be: If we can move from body to body, and we are still considered human we should be considered to be ghosts that take possession of bodies.
What do the visitors see when they see everything and are disappointed? Perhaps, they feel the same disappointment of scientists who opened the scull of people to look at the human mind but see "it all": just flabby gray tissue.
To this day, this seems to be the feeling us who start their own Zettelkasten. The frankensteinian fantasy of creating something alive turns into obsession or disappointment. The mind of the Zettelkasten turns into a ghost, something ethereal and evasive that can hide in plain sight. We dive into our Zettelkastens in search for what we believe we created and just seem to find notes.
So, what is the Zettelkasten? One possible answer might be: The ghost that is able to hide in plain sight and just can be seen from the corner of the eye.
What do you think about that reasoning?]]></summary>

But I’m sorry, Haskell is the grown-up version of Agda, and it is the rational adult in a room full of children when compared to every other programming language. Agda, Idris, etc. are programming ideals, and I would love to see them reach the level of maturity of Haskell. But, guess what?

 I'm thinking it might make the most sense to write the code on a local machine, and compile it on my local machine, and then upload a binary to the cloud. But perhaps there's another way to do this that I don't yet know.
 Ideally I'd like something where I can send HTTP requests to a given url/ip and have Servant handle them and send results back to me.

 I've been trying to find the source of a file-notify--call-handler error:
 file-notify--call-handler: Symbol’s function definition is void: nil 
 I can finally reproduce the error in vanilla emacs using just a few lines of code. First, I evaluate the following in a buffer in vanilla emacs (emacs -Q):
 (require 'filenotify) (require 'autorevert) (require 'subr-x) (global-auto-revert-mode) (save-window-excursion (find-file "~/tmp/test.el")) 
 And then, making use of the updated value of file-notify-descriptors (which I gather changes once you visit a new file if global-auto-revert-mode is enabled), I do the following:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am a recent grad who has been professionally developing software in Haskell over the past two years. 
 I very much enjoy developing in the language and my job in general but I am somewhat worried about my future prospects not working in a more "mainstream" language.
 There aren't many jobs concerning pure statically typed FP languages in my area and I would strongly prefer not to work a fully remote job. I am tied to my current location for the forseeable future. 
 As a result of the above, I worry about a scenario where I would end up losing my job at some point down the road and not being able to carry my experience onto my next job as easily. Is this justified or would it not be difficult to make a switch if need be? I notice vacancies often require several years of experience in whatever programming language the company offering the job is using. My qualifications are solid for my age and I have had the opportunity to contribute to open source projects as well so I guess that might help me in such a scenario. Maybe I should look to contribute to some non-FP open source projects just in case?
 In short, the dilemma I am in is that I do not want to quit my FP job but at the same time I do not want to potentially end up in a bad spot career-wise.
 I figured it could help to have some perspective from other people about this matter and would love to hear your thoughts on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was always surprised that creating an internal link to another heading in org-mode is so laborious: navigate to that heading, store the link, navigate back, insert it. consult-org-heading is a really slick interface to quickly narrow the headings list and jump to one. So why not re-use it to directly insert links to headings at point? I threw together this small gist which works well for this. Now I can invoke consult-org-heading, use orderless to winnow to the heading I want, C-, to embark, and l to insert the link. 
 What methods do you use for quick internal link insertion in org?

 elfeed: 1 jobs pending.. 
 and this on the first line of the search page:
 0 jobs pending, 1 active .. 
 There's no curl job running, in fact emacs has no child running (according to pstree). elfeed itself is still usable. The message survives a deletion of the elfeed buffers and is only cleared if I restart emacs. Which is a pain.
 Any ideas for me before I restart emacs again? (I've already scoured the bug reports at https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/issues)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been taking rock the jvm’s advanced scala course on Udemy, and I feel like there just isn’t enough legitimate practice for the concepts to fully sink in. Basically, I recognize the patterns when they come up in production code that others write, but I have a hard time actually using the patterns myself. Work projects that require me to use them are once in a blue moon type situations, so I need a way where I can hone my scala skills and understanding outside of the day-to-day projects that come up.
 I’m wondering if anyone has advice on how I might craft my own mini practice projects that would help me really get a feel for when to use type classes, implicits, futures, and whatnot. 
 I guess more broadly, my question is: how do I come up with projects to hone my skills without prompting from courses or from product folks at work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I have recently uploaded my first cabal package to Hackage, the text-compression library: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-compression
 This library aims to provide a simple interface to various efficiently implemented compression algorithms.
 Currently, this library only has implementations for the Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Inverse BWT algorithms.
 A brief list of future algorithms to be implemented and supported:
  
FM-index
 Move-to-front (MTF) transform
 Run-length encoding (RLE)
  
And more!
 A test suite is to be implemented for the current and future implementations.
 ​
 I would appreciate any and all feedback, and thank you for taking the time to check out this post and the library!
 ​
 Matt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd describe myself as a relatively senior Haskell-dev. Recently however, I had the opportunity to ask a much more experienced (20y+) Haskell-guru to review my code. He sighed, smiled and and said my code reminded him of his early Haskell days. I asked "how come?", to which he replied
  
I also used to write r instead of request -- you're a programmer, not a mathematician. You're doing Haskell, people already know you're clever -- you don't have to write it on their noses (Swedish proverb)
  
I don't think I'm alone in doing things this way. If I were to justify it, I'd say past-me was carried away by Haskell's promise of extremely concise code, and using 1-3 character variable names lend themselves to that end. Am I (are we?) just being vain at the expense of future maintainability? Have any of you found yourself adopting more descriptive variable names (as is custom in most other languages) with more experience?

I wanted to enable the mouse, so I turned on Xterm Mouse Mode, but once I did that, scrolling seemed to be completely turned off. Whenever I try to scroll, it just says mouse 4/5 are undefined.
 I tried to find a solution online, but the solutions I came across seemed very hack-y. It feels like this kind of thing is just a setting I missed, especially because scrolling was working perfectly fine before. If there is no "direct" solution, I am curious why this is the case. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand the behavior of the variable current-prefix-arg. In particular, I'm trying to understand whether if I pass a prefix argument to func, and other-func is called by func, other-func should be ignoring that prefix argument. 
 Consider the following four functions: 
 (defun f1 (arg) (interactive "P") (when arg "Non-nil")) (defun f2 (arg) (interactive "P") (when current-prefix-arg "Non-nil")) (defun g1 (arg) (interactive "P") (message "%s, %s" current-prefix-arg (f1 nil))) (defun g2 (arg) (interactive "P") (message "%s, %s" current-prefix-arg (f2 nil))) 
 I would have thought that both g1 and g2 would behave the same. But if I call g1 with the C-u prefix key, I get "(4), nil", whereas if I call g2 with the C-u prefix key, I get "(4), non-nil". 
 Is this as it should be? I understand I can bind current-prefix-arg to nil before calling f2, i.e. I could just call f2 inside the scope of a let expression, binding current-prefix-arg to nil. But is there a cleaner way to do this? 
 Looking at the manual section on prefix command arguments hasn't helped me figure this out, so I'm hoping someone here may be able to help.

At first I thought prefix-arg would be passed on to functions in the scope of another, but current-prefix-arg would not; now I'm not sure anymore.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying write a function where depending on what the arguments are, it does different things with out an insane amount of pattern matching. For example, the function eval has 4 arguments. "eval if t 1 2" should return "1" and "eval if f 1 2" should return "2". If the 2nd argument is t i want to return the 3rd argument and if f then the 4th. I need to do this on a bigger scale, but this is a simple example I can think of. Can someone help me out on how to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I wrote two functions for the Haskell functor laws and I am now required to do the following:
 Show that Either String (Maybe Integer) follows the functor laws. You will need several test cases that `shouldBe` True. These cases should test when the Right value is Nothing or Just k, where k is some Integer. Your test cases should also test when Either is a Left value. 
 Will someone please help me understand how to use "either" to test the functor laws? The two functor laws that I wrote are shown below:
 firstFunctorLaw :: (Eq (f a), Functor f) => f a -> Bool
 firstFunctorLaw x = (fmap id x) == x 
 secondFunctorLaw :: (Eq (f c), Functor f) => (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> f a -> Bool
 secondFunctorLaw g f x = (fmap (g.f) x) == (fmap (g . f) $ x)

If you use the same computer in different contexts, let’s say for work
and for your private life, you may wish to install two different
operating systems to protect your private life data from mistakes or
hacks from your work. For instance a cryptolocker you got from a
compromised work email won’t lock out your family photos.
But then you have two different operating systems to manage, and you
may consider that it’s not worth the effort and simply use the same
operating system for your private life and for work, at the cost of
the security you desired.
I offer you a third alternative, a single NixOS managing two securely

 After a period of spooky deliberation and well-received release candidate, Koz and I are pleased to announce mtl-2.3.1, which features the following hellish changelog:
  
Add modifyError to Control.Monad.Error.Class, and re-export from Control.Monad.Except.
 Make the MonadCont instance for ContT more polykinded; now, r is allowed to be of an arbitrary kind k, rather than only Type.
 Add a generic liftCallCC for use with any MonadTrans.
 Add modifyError to Control.Monad.Error.Class
 Return re-export of ExceptT and related functions to Control.Monad.Except.
 Add label function to MonadCont
  
If you wish to migrate to mtl-2.3.x and have not yet done so, please refer the migration guide in the repo: https://github.com/haskell/mtl/blob/master/docs/Mtl-2.3.x-Migration.md
 A release has been published on the github repository under the tag v2.3.1.
 Happy Halloween!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm trying eglot on emacs-29 which I configure like follows (mostly for C++): ```
 (progn (customize-set-variable 'eglot-autoshutdown t) (customize-set-variable 'eglot-extend-to-xref t) (customize-set-variable 'eglot-ignored-server-capabilities (quote (:documentFormattingProvider :documentRangeFormattingProvider)))
 (with-eval-after-load 'eglot (setq completion-category-defaults nil) (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(c-mode c++-mode . ("clangd" "-j=4" "--malloc-trim" "--log=error" "--background-index" "--clang-tidy" "--cross-file-rename" "--completion-style=detailed" "--pch-storage=memory" "--header-insertion=never" "--header-insertion-decorators=0")))) (add-hook 'c-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure) (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure) (add-hook 'rustic-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)) 
 ```
 Things seem to work, however, even when I have requested clangd to not do header insertion --header-insertion=never, eglot keeps inserting headers for me. How can I disable this behaviour or I'm I doing something wrong?
 For example, if I'm on a C++ buffer and I type std::vector then eglot will go ahead and add #include <vector> which I don't want at all.

 On behalf of the EmacsConf 2022 organizers team, I’m very excited to announce the schedule for EmacsConf 2022 (Dec 3 and 4).
 All of the times listed on the schedule are in EST (UTC-5). You can click on each talk’s title to open its page for more information, including its scheduled time in your local time. (Displaying local time requires running a tiny bit of AGPLv3+-licensed free/libre JavaScript code, included on the talk pages.)
 For prerecorded talks, this time is also when the talk’s video will be made available on the same page. Please note that the times are approximations, and that the schedule may change leading up to the conference.
 As the conference approaches, we’ll post more details on how to watch and participate.
 You can subscribe to the emacsconf-discuss mailing list at https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacsconf-discuss to be sure you’ll get updates. We’ll also put updates here on r/emacs.
 Want to help make EmacsConf even awesomer? Volunteer!
 https://emacsconf.org/2022/volunteer/
 We hope to see you all around on Dec 3–4 for EmacsConf 2022!

 The prospective opportunity of contributing cabal packages to Hackage excites me and was wondering if anyone knew of how to be added to the Uploaders group there? I have sent an email but maybe the admins haven't seen/checked emails for new users to be added to the uploaders group?
 Does anyone know if there are any other requirements to be given access to upload packages to Hackage?
 ​
 Thank you in advance!

 One solution would be SortedMap, but I read some benchmarking blog posts that they tend to be slow.
 Other would be implementing a binary heap using a Vector, which is supposed to be faster, but I’m not sure if it will still be faster if I need to perform the sifting on it.
 Is one of these options viable or is it just one of the situations, where using a mutable data structure is the best option?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been using Gnu Emacs in the office for about two weeks now. I'm a vim user and will remain a vim user but I was challenged to try emacs by my colleagues and I in turn challenged them to try Vim. After the promised two weeks I can say the following about emacs from a vimmer perspective.
 I actually LIKE IT. I like the possibilities of emacs and the extensibility although for my workflow it doesn't offer much that vim plugins don't.
  
I don't like emacs PACKAGE MANAGER at all and I don't really care for lisps. I find vim script much easier. I don't like how emacs treats buffers and I find myself constantly killing extra buffers. I don't mind the emacs key bindings that much but I quickly changed the evil mode because muscle memory was killing me. 
  
I both LOVE & HATE M-x commands! I love them cause you can discover so much about was emacs can do but I hate typing them. I REALLY like w3m in emacs! I use w3m in a terminal on a daily basis and with emacs I can just have it open in a buffer or split and do my work at the same time. 
  
I LOVE how great emacs handles RTL languages. It is just great and looks great too.
  
I don't care for org mode! Yea yea I know you will hate me for saying it but I really dont care about it I prefer Vim wiki
  
I DON'T like the emacs terminal options that I've tested so far. K couldn't install vterm so maybe thats why
  
With all that being said I will use both emacs and vim on a daily basis for different things but what would make my life easier in emacs would be if I knew a way to handle buffers more effortlessly in emacs. In vim I can ZZ out of any buffer or split. The emacs evil mode doesn't provide that by default and I couldn't map it myself in the config.
  
PS: I use the latest release of emacs in the Arch repos. I am a frontend web developer.
  
PS2: sorry about the lengthy post, just thought I'd share my experience. Cheers.

A I thought it would be nice if there was a common knowledge base on what Luhmann himself wrote on Zettelkasten. So here is a translation of all 18 notes of the section 9/8 of his second Zettelkasten. I tried to find a middle ground between a translation that is faithful to his style, the nature of the German language, and the least ambigious English I can come up with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While surfing around on Emacs Stack Exchange, someone commented to go look at dir-locals-set-directory-class. It has a closely associated function called dir-locals-set-class-variables.
 Base Emacs knows about projects. Projects are defined (mostly) via version control. I know about Projectile and use it as well but this is in base Emacs introduced in version 23.
 The two steps are to first set up dir local variables based upon class using dir-locals-set-class-variables. I explain why I used eval later but I did this:
 lisp (dir-locals-set-class-variables 'proj1 '((nil . ((eval . (pedz/proj1-set-default-mode-locals)))) (enh-ruby-mode . ((eval . (pedz/proj1-set-enh-ruby-mode-locals)))))) 
 The second step is to tie a project (specified by its directory) to a class like this:
 lisp (dir-locals-set-directory-class "~/Source/proj1" 'proj1) 
 And you are done. The two functions pedz/proj1-set-default-mode-locals and pedz/proj1-set-enh-ruby-mode-locals will be called based upon the mode of the file being visited within the project. And they are also called for such things as compile buffers and other buffers not visiting files within the project based upon default-directory. Those functions can set variables, enable modes, etc.
 So... you are asking Why not just use .dir-locals.el?
 The answer is because of risky variables. I now have three variables that end with program which are (properly) considered risky that need to be set in this project and it isn't possible to type ! and tell Emacs "Yes... those variables for this directory are ok. Please don't pull on my shirt tail again about this.". Rather, each new file that is opened, it will ask if those variables are ok to be set.
 And I totally get why. It is unsafe to just set those variables based upon something that may or may not be under your control. But your init files are (or should be) under your control. So, I've moved all of the project specific settings into my init files.

 (defvar my-table (make-hash-table)) (puthash 'foo '(nil nil 0) my-table) (puthash 'bar '(nil nil 0) my-table) (puthash 'baz '(nil nil 0) my-table) (defun do-stuff () (let ((running (nth 0 (gethash key my-table))) (chain-state (nth 1 (gethash key my-table))) (last-idle-value (nth 2 (gethash key my-table)))) (setf running t))) (do-stuff 'bar) 
 then I would hope that (gethash 'bar my-table) shows me the row (t nil 0) but it's still (nil nil 0).
 This matters because now the only thing that will work is if I don't let-bind. And that makes my large functions super-unreadable with (nth 1 (gethash key my-table)) all over the place. 
 I've also tried cl-letf and seq-let, they don't help here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR - how to make sure my server written in IO doesnt die when load spikes. Also how to not have latency spikes but instead return errors when server limits are reached 
 So in his talk The Case For Effect Systems Spiewak says something(its timestamped) like "I had a service that could handle 100 connection and then when it got a 1000 it didnt crash because it was written with IO and Resource" and doest really elaborate on why that was the case 
 From my point of view its very easy to have such guaranties in "1 thread per request" model since all you have to say is "this thread pool of size 100 will handle http connections" and 101th concurrent connection will fail cause you dont have a thread to for it. When with effect systems and asynchronous stuff in general(eg NodeJs which only has 1 thread) where you have n threads to handle a much bigger m of concurrent connection you dont have that. And generally its a good thing cause what you do is essentially keep a queue of things to do trading memory and latency for the ability to handle any number of connection up to the limits of you your systems resources. You latency rises but you dont return 500s. Up to the point where you die.
 And I dont see how IO and Resource would help you with now dying when IO(and to be fair Futures) is the thing that enables such a problem

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I have been playing with keymaps and wrapper commands a lot. And something I have come to realise is that a lot of stuff could be implemented really fast by sending arbitrary key sequences. 
 Keyboard macros seem limited to me : they look more like a succession of commands than a succession of keys.
 Two examples I could not achieve with macros (maybe I'm doing it wrong)
 - Prepare a command : for example I want to prepare a call to isearch, with foo pre-typed into the minibuffer. When I do it the macro way, the macro will execute the command isearch foo
 - Define an alias for partial key-bindings : let's say I want to alias C-x r to C-r, so that i can type C-r t instead of C-x r t (which is bound to #'string-rectangle). I could not make a keyboard macro work since C-x r is not bound to anything
 Is there anyway to send arbitrary key sequences to the emacs interpreter from elisp ?
 ​
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the docs, it seems that when building emacs, one obtains an executable called temacs which then loads the elisp libraries that give us a functioning editor. I imagine this temacs binary is just an elisp interpreter. Is there a way to interact with temacs like one does with the sbcl repl and manually load the elisp libraries to see how emacs bootstraps in real time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, guys! I have the technical question.
 Need to merge the payload if the reference number(refNo) is the same in different messages. Limitation is that I can only use a KTable and if the key is an even number I don't need to merge the payload. Additionally, the order of incoming messages should not change the result.
 ​
 For example, if we have an empty topic and incoming messages are:
 ​
 1: { key: "1", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1}} }
 2: { key: "2", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }
 3: { key: "3", value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} } // this one should be not effected and left how it is
 ​
 Expected result:
 ​
 1: { key: "1", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1, data2}} }
 2: { key: "2", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }
 3: { key: "3", value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} }
 ​
 The only way I can think of to do this is to use two times .groupBy and join with the original topic everything again.
 ​
  
First change the key to refNo, save the key to the value itself, and join the payload during aggregation.
 Secondly .groupBy revert key to the initial state.
 The last step joins everything to the original topic because I lost one message during grouping by.
  
​
 I'm pretty sure there's an easier way to do this. What is the most optimized and elegant way to solve this issue?
 ​
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, I am not the author of this tool, but have used toc-mode to make tables of contents for pdf and djvu files for many times. There are only a few other tools have the same functionality, but toc-mode is supposed to be the most convenient one. 
 Most other tools are command line, which is not adequate for this task. Even though a pdf contains the information of its table of contents, it is almost impossible to get a perfect table of contents automatically. You always need to do some editing to the extracted table, and this is why having this tool in Emacs is reasonable. Most editors focus on programming code, but things involving editing are more than that. I think toc-mode is a good example.
 By the way, the same author has more ambitious goals to create better a better doc viewer with some editing functionalities in Emacs. This is again a great example how Emacs do can more than code editing.

I take a lot of notes that involve figures and equations. Due to my dislike for latex, I type all of my notes using markdown in vim. While markdown is fine for simple readmes, it's a bit lacking when it comes to organizing figures or making anything but basic tables. I would like to know whether orgmode has the ability to group figures. There are two kinds of these. The first is the type where you have multiple independent figures along a row, with each having its own caption. The second is like the first but in addition to each figure having its own caption, there's a caption for the whole group. Can emacs do that without resorting to using ugly latex code ?

 ​
 In case you haven't tried compilation-shell-minor-mode inside an inferior shell, please give it a try. You won't regret it. It also works with vterm, but you need to do a little extra work to make sure the key bindings don't conflict with each other.

 • Couldn't match type: (b0 -> c0) -> a0 -> b0 with: forall a. (a -> a) -> a -> a Expected: ChurchNumeral -> ChurchNumeral Actual: ((b0 -> c0) -> a0 -> b0) -> (b0 -> c0) -> a0 -> c0 • In the expression: s (s (k s) k) In an equation for ‘csucc’: csucc = s (s (k s) k) | 130 | csucc = s (s (k s) k) | 
 How could I get this version to compile? I'm guessing passing in the argument explicitly allows GHC to know that the second argument of the most-outer s call has the expected type, but leaving that s partially applied, GHC is looking for the type in the signature of s and it can't unify that type with ChurchNumeral. Is that correct?
 Thank you in advance!

You can make looping patterns greedy using the pattern.greedy() method, but you cannot yet make group patterns greedy.
  
And in the examples they have the following comment for greedy:
 // expecting 2, 3 or 4 occurrences and repeating as many as possible start.times(2, 4).greedy()
 What do they mean by repeating as many as possible in this context?

 The proposal and paper don't seem to mention record patterns. Is this an oversight, or an intentional decision because it would make the grammar ambiguous, or something else? Does anyone know a workaround?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of you Zettelkasten fans might be interested in an outdated and idiosyncratic program called Literary Machine. You can learn more here:
http://sommestad.com/lm.htm
The program is powerful but far from intuitive, so here are my personal notes about how to use it:
The core items in LM are:
Concept/category words (in the Dictionary pane).
Text items (notes; little boxes in which you write text).
Projects (collections of selected text items).
In a regular outliner program, you add items to a category (in a tree view or hierarchical list); in LM, it's just the opposite: you add categories to an item (similar to tagging with #hashtags. This is true for LM projects, too. You don't add items to a project; you add projects to an item. All of this is done by dragging a concept (dictionary word)…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Actually, I already tried setting it up in VSCode, I installed stack, then a bunch of haskell extensions, then VSCode told me to install GHCup, and then updated extensions and what not and now nothing works.
 Whenever I try running my program with "Load GHCI" I get this kind of message: 
 <no location info>: error: can't find file: Lib.hs Failed, no modules loaded. 
 And when I try executing the default "someFunc" function (which basically prints a string) I get: 
 <interactive>:1:1: error: Variable not in scope: someFunc 
 What's wrong? How can I fix that? Or maybe I should just start from 0? Or even use a different IDE? What do you guys recommend?
 I'm very much fascinated with Haskell, category theory and functional programming, but how can I get into it when I'm unable to execute a simple Haskell program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a way to bypass org-agenda dispatcher (unsure about the terminology here: I'm talking about the buffer you get immediately upon calling org-agenda), and thought of a simple way of doing it. 
 (defun my/org-agenda () (interactive) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list 'my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((view (cdr (assoc (completing-read "Select an agenda view: " my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view nil))) 
 That worked just fine, but I thought it'd be nice to be able to pass restrictions (to buffer, subtree, etc.) to the function, perhaps using C-u as a prefix for a buffer restriction and C-u C-u for a subtree restriction. So I figured this should work: 
 (defun my/org-agenda-restr (&optional arg) (interactive "P") (when arg (org-check-for-org-mode)) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list 'my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg '(4)) 'buffer) ((equal arg '(16)) 'subtree))) (view (cdr (assoc (completing-read "Select an agenda view: " my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view restr))) 
 But it doesn't. For some reason, no matter which custom view I try to call, I get a CRM prompt asking me to choose a keyword. 
 Now, I thought maybe I was passing the wrong type of object as the third argument for org-agenda, So I tested using this, and it looks like what I'm passing as the third argument is a symbol, which I thought is what it wanted: 
 (defun my/test (&optional arg) (interactive "P") (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg '(4)) 'buffer) ((equal arg '(16)) 'subtree)))) (when (symbolp restr) (message "Yes")))) 
 So I'm going wrong somewhere, but cannot figure out where.

 But while the loading of my emacs works without any problem when located under .emacs.d, if I use chemacs2 and relocate my default config under .emacs.nano, I get the error that the library guess-language is missing, when starting emacs with emacs --with-profile default. Why does this problem only come with chemacs2? I am using straight as the package manager. 
 Has anyone else also similar problems with chemacs2?

Zettelkasten contains many atom thoughts and this method chains each thought together by their unique addresses. This web of thoughts makes it convenient to visit from one thought to another.

 I tried to bind C-= to er/expand-region from the expand-region package but nothing happens when I press C-=. 
 If I try C-h k C-= it's as if I hadn't pressed any key at all. The minibuffer prompts me to press some keys as if I hadn't pressed anything. 
 For example a bare text-mode buffer C-h k C-= C-p previous-line.
 Further, if i try binding C-S-= the same situation - it's ignored. Yet binding C-+ works so when I press C-S-= what is bound to C-+ executes.
 As far as I can tell my OS (linux) window manager (xfce4 xf4wm) doesn't bind C-= to anything special.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I am working on a Haskell project using cabal. It is a simple executable cabal project with a Main.hs file which imports a few other .hs files.
 Whenever I build it using cabal new-run, the imported source files seem to only get recompiled if something that depends on them changes in Main.hs. This is the case regardless of whether they have been edited since the last compilation.
 How can I change this behavior? Am I doing something wrong? Surely I should be able to edit the imported files and have the changes be reflected upon compiling the project?
 My workaround as of now is to systematically delete, before each compilation, all the files generated by cabal during the last one, which I am sure is not the intended way.
 Sorry if my question is dumb; as might be apparent I don't know much about the compilation process but I'd be happy to know more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kinda clickbait title, but I'll go with it. I'm someone who's familiar with both functional and oo paradigm and have experience working on industrial/research project with both. Although I work with different languages and paradigms for work and study purposes, I personally prefer Haskell over other languages I work with.
 Recently, I decided to learn a new language (for fun, for job hunt etc) and am thinking of Scala. Since I love Haskell, I wanted to start with Functional Programming in Scala. However, seems like the book doesn’t cover Scala 3. Should I worry about it and use some other resource? Or should I just go with Scala 2.x?
 Also, since I haven’t started learning, I'd appreciate if you let me know if I should learn it or something else (maybe "Go for elixir since you like strictly functional stuff")?
 Thanks!
 Edit: Thank you all for your valuable comments. I made up my mind to give Scala a try. Probably I will start with 2.x and move to 3 after getting some head around it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm making a compiler for a Computer Science class for a fairly simple language based on pascal (Pascal-0).
 In this language, we have a few reserved keywords, the thing is, they are case-insensitive (as are the variables). That means that for example, function, FUNCTION and funCTiOn all mean the same thing.
 As these are reserved keywords, I can easily "hard-code" them into the Lexer with something like this:
 function { \_ -> FUNCTION } 
 But this obviously is not case insensitive.
 I found a possible way to do it with maps, but I really would prefer to do it via regex if possible.
 Obviously, I can also do something like:
  (f|F)(u|U) ... (o|O)(n|N) 
 but that's obviously out of the question as it is not scalable.
 Is this at all possible, and is there a better way to do it other than maps, if regex isn't possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to have a completing-read type command that can perform commonly used file moving/copying operations. For example, I'm constantly syncing a couple of projects to a remote machine where they run. Currently I bind a key for each one to an rsync shell command call like so:
 (defun myprojectA-sync () (interactive) (shell-command (concat "rsync -a --progress --exclude-from='~/myprojectA/.syncignore' ~/myprojectA/ remotemachine1:~/myprojectA/ && echo 'Done.'")))) (map! :leader :desc "Sync my project A from local machine" "c b" #'myprojectA-sync) 
 It'd be helpful to have one single command to call a completion list that can run the pre-defined file operations for Project A, B, C, etc. I don't see why they couldn't act on multiple machines (remotemachine1, remotemachine2, etc.) or use different commands (mv, scp, rsync, etc.).
 Is there some feature/package that already exists to do something like this? 
 If not, does anyone have suggestions for a novice in elisp when it comes to writing the function? My thoughts so far were just a bunch of lists like
 (setq sync-names '("Sync project A" "Sync project B")) (setq sync-method '("rsync" "scp")) (setq sync-dest-dir '("remotemachine1:~/dir1" "remotemachine2:~/otherdir")) 
 to call shell-command wrapped in competing-read.

 Then outputs false IF the type does not equal Num
  
Currently i have:
 ziffertest :: Num -> Bool
 ziffertest x = x<10 && x>=0 && TYPE CONDITION
 In consequence e.g. f only puts out an error and not a boolean false.
 Thanks in advance and have a nice day.

I'm building Emacs from source on Mac OS, 12.4 w/ M1.
 
I'm configuring Emacs with native compilation.
 
  ./configure --with-native-compilation \ --with-ns \ --disable-silent-rules 
  
The build succeeds, src/emacs runs like a charm and I make install.
 
My nextstep/Emacs.app runs, but emits a ton of libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver errors to the Messages buffer.
 
 I suspect the Emacs.app package has some misconfigured paths that are unable to find my libgccjit library, which I've installed via homebrew. I've tried experimenting with exec-path-from-shell to ensure Emacs is aware of my shell paths, but to no avail.
 In the meantime, I've been able to use emacs and emacsclient from the CLI with no issues to speak of. The only problems arise when I interact with the Emacs.app application. Anyone have an idea as to what's going on here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using GADTs to model the domain of my programme, and quite enjoying the experience, but have found that it requires quite a lot of boilerplate.
 For example, I am building a series of "filter" functions which filter input datatypes:
  data MyType = TypeOne | TypeTwo data MyEntity (t :: MyType) where MyEntityOne :: String -> MyEntity 'TypeOne MyEntityTwo :: String -> String -> MyEntity 'TypeTwo 
 I can create input filters which I can nicely compose with a fish (>=>) operator:
  filterOnes :: forall a. MyEntity a -> Maybe (MyEntity 'TypeOne) filterOnes x@(MyEntityOne {}) = Just x filterOnes _ = Nothing 
 The thing is, I'm finding writing this sort of case a bit tedious, and it would be much nicer to have something like this:
  filterOnes = filterFor @'TypeOne -- or, even better myFilter :: forall a. MyEntity a -> Maybe (MyEntity 'TypeOne) myFilter = (filterFor @'TypeOne) >=> someOtherFilter 
 But I don't know how to create something like this, which reminds me of the generic-lens library. I feel like this might be a common pattern with GADTs, is there an obvious solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've got some exciting news to share.
 Earlier this year, I've released the first version of HVM, a massively parallel functional runtime that aims to be the ultimate target for pure functional languages like Haskell, Elm, Kind and many others, and finally unleash the inherent parallelism of the functional paradigm. HVM's first version was very limited; it could only parallelize algorithms that recursed in a perfect binary tree fashion, it lacked IO and had some synchronization bugs. Soon, we'll be releasing an updated version, which fixes these bugs, includes IO primitives, and a new workstealing-based scheduler, which is capable of generalizing to basically any functional program that isn't inherently sequential. For example, it can use all cores on the computation of Fib(n), achieving maximal performance!
 The most exciting news, though, is that a GPU runtime is on the works. I've just, right now, finished the very initial prototype, a self-contained, 1200-LOC file that evaluates a busy recursive function on the GPU. It is performing about 680 million rewrites/second on 4096 cores of my Laptop RTX 3080. That's 4x more than single-thread performance, on the very first attempt of the very first prototype. I believe we'll soon be reaching record benchmarks on GPUs. Several API improvements and stability features will also be included on the upcoming update.
 We're ahead of very exiting times for functional programming, and I hope this encourages language developers to target the HVM! Imagine a working STG->HVM compiler? We're also interested in hiring a CUDA professional to help us profile and improve the GPU back-end. If you know someone who'd be interested, please let me know via DM! And be welcome to visit our Discord community and ask anything on the #HVM channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In particular, I can type "hel wor" to narrow to "hello-world" in a helm M-x session, but in selectrum, from what I can see with the defaults, it expects me to type "hw" - which is nice (and I believe helm also supports) - but sometimes I would like to type space separated words and have the candidate list narrow in sequence based on each being a partial match.
 This was an especially noticeable deficiency when trying selectrum with projectile-find-file - I couldn't open my dotfiles and type "init" to find "init.el", as it seemed to want me to specify the entire path preceding it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using emacs to write tex documents for a long time, and recently switched to spacemacs, with evil mode. I use the reftex command reftex-reference to insert \ref commands. In spacemacs evil mode, when I use this, the reference is inserted *before* the cursor (point), so that it's off by one character. I would like to know if it's possible to configure this to insert after. I'm asking here because I think this is a general evil-mode issue rather than a specific spacemacs configuration issue. Details below.
 Here's what happens:
 Have a tex file with some text like the following, with the cursor at the rectangle marker, and with the buffer in evil's "normal state" (like vim's normal mode), not insert mode.
 \begin{theorem}\label{mylabel} theorem text \end{theorem} Now some words▮ 
 Note that this is what happens when there's a space *after* "words" in the text; in evil's normal state, the cursor is a block that occupies the position of a character.
 Then I use the reftex-reference command and select "mylabel". The inserted text I get is
 Now some words\ref{mylabel}▮ 
 with the inserted \ref *before* the trailing space. Then the space appears *after*. I believe the line that actually does the inserting is line 510 of reftex-ref.el.
 ​
 To be clear, this is not because the final character is a space. If I delete the space after "words", positioning my cursor on the final "s", then the inserted reference looks like
 Now some word\ref{mylabel}s 
 with the cursor positioned on the final "s".
 ​
 So, the problem seems to be that reftex-reference is doing the insertion on the *left* side of the "normal state" cursor, not the right. I would like it to insert on the right. Does anyone here know how this can be configured?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I guess this is a rhetorical question because I doubt anyone knows why but it turns out that dired buffers return nil for buffer-file-name instead of the path to the directory they are viewing.
 I believe this has cost me a ton of time but I did learn a lot along the way. lsp-docker highest level function is lsp-docker-start. It calls lsp-workspace-root which calls buffer-file-name which, if starting from a dired buffer, returns nil so lsp-workspace-root returns nil and the LSP server is not started.
 This is my first venture into LSP mode and I was doing something slightly different, a basic low level function was returning nil, so I assumed I was way off track in my set up, and I needed to dig deeper. And, indeed, I came up with a solution. I was documenting what I had found for myself so I wouldn't forget and started asking myself more questions.
 I went back and tested lsp-workspace-root in a file that had LSP mode enabled and it returned the proper path for the workspace. I then restarted everything, loaded lsp-mode but didn't start it, and went to the directory of the project. Sure enough, lsp-workspace-root returned nil (as it had before). I then looked at the code and started to try and follow it step by step. That's when I discovered that dired buffers have no buffer-file-name. I opened TAGS (an arbitrary file within the project) and now lsp-workspace-root returns the proper workspace.
 I think I could have set up my LSP stuff with a simple YAML file had I tried lsp-docker-start from a file rather than a dired buffer and saved the time spent coming up with the solution I pointed to.
 Anyhow... live and learn I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To add to the list of Haskell wishes I posted yesterday: instance derivation for variable size tuples.
 That each tuple size has to be treated separately is really annoying. A lot of effort has been spent on much less important (= less common) problems, it certainly can be solved somehow with the syntax for variable type tuple size + extended tuple size... Actually maybe I'm just reinventing some existing wheel, but I've never seen it used.
 For example:
 class Encoding a where encode :: a -> String 
 Now I have to do:
 instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) = encode a <> encode b instance Encoding (a, b, c) where encode (a, b, c) = encode a <> encode b <> encode c -- and so on until the limit of either tuple size or patience is reached 
 You can see code like this across endless number of libraries, including base
 Why cannot I instead have something like this:
 instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) = encode a <> encode b instance Encoding (..., b) where encode (a@..., b) = encode a <> encode b 
 Never mind the specific syntax, it can be whatever, but the idea is to define instance for all tuple sizes recursively.
 Is it maybe possible already?
 That would also require (and allow) some size-polymorphic operations to add/split the first/last tuple elements, in a type safe way.
 I've no idea why it doesn't already exist.

 I am wondering whether someone has used org-mode as a basis for publishing documentation of Python projects via Sphinx. Actually, I am looking for a workflow to write my documentation in org-mode, convert it to .md or .rst, add Sphinx' autodoc-extension and finally publish the result with GitHub Pages. 
 Has somebody done something like that? Thanks...

 I am watching Rainer König's video on scheduling, deadlines and agenda view. I cannot use the agenda view. One of the comments says:
 Quick tips, the keybinding for agenda view has to be setted on the init file. Standard recommendation seems to be :

 I can't quite figure how to search across all the documentation for a specific word or regex if possible. 
 Example: I know that org-clock-report table (or clocktable) has :narrow param. I initially found it in google but now, since I know it exists, how can I quickly find info about this param directly in emacs? For example I want to find a manual page where this param is mentioned. Is there anything like apropos-EVERYTHING command that will look for a word (or regex) in all documentation? 
 Even more. I now know that info about :narrow param for clock table can be found in org manual on a page called The clock table. I know it from google. How could I find this page using emacs? 
 How would you find that page in emacs manual?
 P.S. I know about describe-* and apropos-* (and info) functions but I don't see any function that does the search across everything. There are also similar questions in the internet and there is a suggestion to search the documentation with grep or zgrep which I don't find useful. They just search in *.info files which when opened don't behave as info pages. Is greping the only way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen developers expensing a Sublime Text / JetBrains license to their employer, no questions asked. It would be amazing if one could similarly contribute financially towards emacs development efforts. 
 Would it be possible to cook up something formal enough (through FSF or some other org) like an annual "Emacs support license" with a couple of different tiers based on amounts (such that users can choose the split to different projects of interest). Users might then be able to expense it at work with the justification that it helps improve the specific packages they depend on (including core emacs). The same "licenses" could equally well serve as a portal for personal donations, but I feel that there's likely substantial low-hanging fruit in getting corporate funding in this grassroots manner.
 (I've pondered about this before, but some questions on the emacs survey reminded me of this again.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently switching my package management from Debian to Guix, and so far it's been wonderful. However, I just found something very curious. In the screenshot, you can see my 'old' self compiled Emacs (28.1) and my new Emacs (28.2) installed via Guix. They render the same text in the same file, in the same theme, with the same font (as per M-x describe-font), but they look quite different.
 Here's a screenshot showing the two side by side: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-a7bdddc0.png
 The version to the left is quite thin, the weight seems off. However, the weight is the same. Changing the weight will not remove this discrepancy. 
 Both Debian and Guix have the bold variant of Fira installed: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-36be0060.png
 Generally speaking, the bold variant works insofar that I can use it globally: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-5620acc4.png
 However, when used in a font-face, it won't become bold: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-bb7ddfd5.png
 I'm happy if anyone can point me to the necessary change to make the new install look the same as before. Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 Hi everyone, 
 ​
 I'm trying to write an elisp function that allows me to more easily query org-roam database with various keywords.
 ​
 Suppose I want to find all the titles that contain both "hello" and "world", I know this can be done with a single query instance like the following:
 ​
 (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from titles
 :where (and (like title "%hello%")
 (like title "%world%")) ] )
 ​
 Now I'm trying to turn this into an elisp function to make it easier to use. However, the challenge is my queries can contain an arbitrary number of keywords, for example:
 (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from titles
 :where (and (like title "%hello%")
 (like title "%world%") 
 (like title "%again%")) ] )
 ​
 The function should thus accept a list of keywords and return the notes that contains ALL the keywords in that list, something like:
 ​
 my-func('("hello" "world")) -> should return all notes containing "hello" "world"
 my-func('("hello" "world" "again")) -> should return all notes containing "hello" "world" "again"
 ​
 Can anyone suggest how to implement such a function?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone.
 Since I started working with Haskell professionally at the beginning of the year (yay!), and neovim is my editor of choice, I've decided to put some elbow grease into improving my experience.
 And of course I would be happy to share it with (and get feedback/contributions/ideas from) any other Haskellers who use neovim!
 haskell-tools.nvim
  
Built around haskell-language-server, mostly.
 I just finished work on a feature that triggers a hoogle search for the type signature of whatever is under the cursor.
  
On a side note, my neotest-haskell adapter (TreeSitter-powered hspec tests) now supports both Cabal and Stack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone proficient in Haskell can give me some pointers on a homework assignment I'm currently bashing my head against. We're currently covering higher order functions, and our professor wants us to write a function that acts as a form of simple memory storage. Here's the part of the assignment that's stumping me:
 -- We'll consider a different way to represent memory. Memoryf is a function from variable names to values. type Memoryf = String -> Int -- The function memf1 gives all variables the value of zero memf1 = \_ -> 0 -- The following commands use the function putValue to modify our memory function: memf2 = putValuef "z" 3 memf1 memf3 = putValuef "y" (-2) memf2 memf4 = putValuef "x" 1 memf3 -- putValue should take three arguments: -- 1. The name of a variable, x -- 2. The variable value m -- 3. A Memoryf function -- putValue should assign x to m and return the updated Memoryf function putValue :: String -> Int -> Memoryf -> Memoryf putValue x m memf = _________________________ -- Write your code here -- Example output: -- (putValue "x" 5 memf4) "x" -- 5 
 My thinking is that calling putValue should add something to the effect of "if memf x is called, return m" but I have no idea how to write this. The furthest I've gotten is:
 putValue :: String -> Int -> Memoryf -> Memoryf putValue x m memf = (\x -> m) 
 which is useless because it will return the value of m for any variable, and thus doesn't work as a store of value.
 I'd greatly appreciate any guidance y'all have to offer. I'm giving myself a headache trying to sort through this myself.

 I most likely won't move back to projectile with this information, but may implement any very compelling features atop project.el.

 ​
 Is anyone able to compile on the latest MacOS?

 So far, I've been unable to link the libgccjit hello world: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html
 The farthest I can get is to the following errors:
 gcc-11: warning: could not understand version '13.00.00'
 ld: -rpath can only be used when targeting Mac OS X 10.5 or later
 collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
 At which point, it seems as if the problems are inherent to gcc-11 in combination with MacOS's ld. Anyone able to make this work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I was trying lsp-mode. After getting a bit annoyed with my laptop's fan always getting activated, I decided to try eglot. So far it feels much more lightweight.
 I'm having trouble getting it to do some things though.
 For context, I use pyvenv to manage my virtual environments:
 (use-package pyvenv:ensure t:config(pyvenv-mode 1)(pyvenv-activate "~/miniconda3/envs/myenv/"))
 I have done both conda install python-lsp-server[all] -c conda-forge and conda install pyright in this environment.
 If I use pyright-langserver, then a lot of imports are "unknown".
 If I use pylsp, then those imports seem to work, but I get some funny autocompletion behaviour. 
 import numpy as np
 np.lin
 This says "no completion found". But
 from numpy import linalg
 linalg.
 This works as expected, and I get reasonable suggestions for completions.
 ​
 Can someone tell me what's going on here and I to get this working? I was hoping things would work right out of the box, but...

 I recently switched to straight.el mostly for packages contributing purposes and it works really great. 
 In my init.el I sometimes use package-installed-p function to check if package is installed but straight.el doesn't install packages "emacs way" so that function always return nil. I expect there should be similar function in straight.el but I can't find one. 
 Do you know if it's exists? 
 Thanks
 EDIT: There is straight--installed-p but it expects a RECIPE and I don't really understand what is this. Definitely not a package name

It updates the schedule time and properties, but also adds that last line - State "DONE"... which I don't want to have. Is there a way to prevent this?

 My usual workflow is that I'm working on a project (with .projectile in the root directory), and at some point I need to working on files outside of this project.
 I'll then C-x 5 2 to create a new frame and start opening files there. Then I switch buffers, and what I see are all my buffers.
 Is there a way in which I could group/filter buffers based on some default criteria? For example, if the buffer belongs to a project (with a .projectile file), filter those buffers into one group. 
 Or better yet, simply add filters so that I can stay organized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use doom emacs and it offers [ ], [-] and [X] as part of the org-todo-keywords.
 In the org-agenda I noticed that the state changes for these states are not listed with the corresponding time when org-agenda-log-mode is active.
 Here is an example to display what it looks like instead:
 Tuesday 25 October 2022 inbox: 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ State: (DONE) DONE Test1 TODO -> DONE inbox: State: ([X]) [X] Test2 [ ] -> [X] 
 The headline with Test2 is displayed without the time. Both headlines have a LOGBOOK drawer that does look the same.
 * DONE Test1 TODO -> DONE :LOGBOOK: - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2022-10-25 Tue 10:00] :END * [X] Test2 [ ] -> [X] :LOGBOOK: - State "[X]" from "[ ]" [2022-10-25 Tue 10:00] :END 
 Further it seems like all todo keywords that start with [ and end with ] are not displayed with the corresponding time but below the time-grid with State: in front like seen above.
 I believe I tracked down the function that generates the State: entries (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/9bfe00dda6b59d9b93eb7a825f6e0868afa1cca3/lisp/org/org-agenda.el#L5943) but I am not really able to understand the function and what is causing this behavior as I am fairly new to emacs/elisp
 Is there someway to show the tasks with the checkbox style todo keywords with time?
 Is this a bug or a feature that I can configure?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my internship at Tweag, I got the opportunity to work on Chainsail (see the announcement blog post), a web service that helps to sample from multimodal probability distributions.
A common approach to sampling well-behaved distributions involves Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods derived from the
basic Metropolis-Hastings algorithm; building a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its stationary distribution.
The major benefit of Metropolis-Hastings over more “direct” sampling methods is that it doesn’t require the target distribution to be normalized.
But it does have a big flaw:
if the distribution presents multiple modes separated by areas of low probability, the Markov chain tends to get stuck in one mode, and thus samples the distribution incorrectly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its initial release (corresponding thread) the library has got several improvements (the current version is 2.2.0.0), but the most significant development happened within the ecosystem. Here's the list of new adapter libraries:
  
crypto-rng-effectful - generation of cryptographically secure random bytes and numbers.
 
log-effectful - structured logging with multiple backends.
 
hpqtypes-effectful - access to a PostgreSQL database.
 
retry-effectful - combinators for monadic actions that may fail.
 
 It's worth noting that all of these are light wrappers over existing libraries, not rewrites. As advertised, effectful makes it easy to adapt libraries to be used as effects.
 Also, the Monocle project has moved to effectful.
 If anyone was skeptical about effectful, maybe that'll convince you to give it another look. I'm sure this is just the beginning :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to this: https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/10/20/language-rankings-6-22/
 ​
 What is surprising is that it is:
 - more adopted than Clojure that I thought to be the most popular functional language (even though I think it's really bad).
 - much more adopted than Erlang and F#, I thought Haskell is used less frequently than these.
 - has almost as many projects as Elixir in GitHub, but much more popular on Stack Overflow - shows the strength of the community.
 - as widely adopted as Perl.
 ​
 Looking at this chart I think we can get Haskell into the top 10 (or even 5) languages by solving several problems, as community (I do have a vested interest that it happens – our SimpleX Chat is written in Haskell):
 - make JSON a first class citizen in Haskell code, ideally with some syntax-level support, without requiring QQ, rather than one of the most complex to use libraries. It doesn't seem a coincidence that 2 most popular languages - JavaScript and Python - make it really easy to integrate with JSON.
 - make cross-platform compilation "manageable" (including mobile and web), not just "possible".
 - solve problem of compiled binary size - it should be at least 5x, better 10x smaller – even if it comes at cost of 10x longer compilation time (so that we would only use it for production builds).
 - at the same time, make interpreted tests execution simpler - I still can't figure out how to do it, waiting for several minutes until it builds with most cores idling is very time consuming... Maybe this is a solved problem, and there is a simple answer how to do it.
 - make networking and cryptography more trustworthy - with exodus of some maintainers into Rust-land they are at risk of abandonment – I will share more comments on this subject a bit later.
 ​
 These are all issues that Haskell Foundation and community can help solving, we could chip in some time/money too if there is some concerted effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for suggestions for how to manage repeated tasks with subtasks. Ideally, I'd like to be able to mark the parent heading as done and have all the DONE subtasks (or even better, those without a certain property) be changed to TODO. In practice, what I want is to be able to move from this: 
 * TODO Meal plan for the week SCHEDULED: <2022-10-24 +1w> ** DONE Make list of dishes ** DONE Make grocery list ** DONE Get groceries 
 to this: 
 * TODO Meal plan for the week SCHEDULED: <2022-10-31 +1w> ** TODO Make list of dishes ** TODO Make grocery list ** TODO Get groceries 
 after marking the heading task as done. 
 I suspect I could make use of org-todo-repeat-hook and define a function that will take all the sub-tasks of a given task and change them from e.g. DONE to TODO, or to the TODO state the parent will be in after repeat, e.g. 
 (defun my/org--bequeath-state () (let ((state (org-get-todo-state))) (org-map-entries (lambda () (org-todo state)) nil 'tree))) (add-to-list 'org-todo-repeat-hook 'my/org--bequeath-state) 
 But I'm wondering if anyone has given this more thought and has a better conceived solution they'd be willing to share.

So that's what I've been doing, along with using pyvenv to choose my virtual environments. But I've noticed that I don't get any warnings if my lines are too long. I'm not sure why this is? Does it have to do with my settings, or is this not something lsp/pyright should catch?

As I’ve revisited my configuration today, I noticed that there are a few recent package managers (namely, leaf and elpaca) which are new to - at least - me and (at least elpaca) want to be straight.el’s “successor”.
 Is there any write-up about the state of GNU Emacs package management in 2022? Straight.el works for me (and I need its custom build features for two packages), but I don’t want to rely on deprecated packages for too long.

 I have searched in web, and found that Flycheck is using wrong dir, but i don't know how customize that. Is there some option to Flycheck work well on Django?
 pylint has an module named pylint-django. Can be this enhabled in Flycheck?
 Edit: I found solution that works to me for now, but isn't automatic.
 1) Install pylint-django pluging with pip pip install pylint-django
 2) Create a pylint config file in the root directory of project. You can do thi from terminal
 pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc
 3)Enhable Django pluging in pylint config file in "load-plugins" line
 load-plugins=pylint_django
 That worked to me. When you start flychek in current buffer, you can see if flycheck is using the config file:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From October 24th to November 30th, the 2022 edition of the Emacs User survey will be collecting responses!
 📋 https://emacssurvey.org/
 About the Survey
 This time there are no non-free Javascript or user-tracking caveats as this features a bespoke survey framework written from scratch for the Emacs User Survey to support a pure HTML-forms + CSS approach with server-side rendering 🎉.
 See the FAQ for more information on the survey itself.
 Promoting the survey
 It would be fantastic for this to be shared as far and wide as possible, to get responses from a large swathe of the community. If you can share this with the non-Reddit Emacs communities you are a part of, as well as any friends or colleagues that use Emacs that would be greatly appreciated 😊.
 So far the Survey has been shared on: - Reddit - Hacker News - Lobste.rs
 Addendum: all my responses are shown as missing?
 It has been noticed by several people that their results page shows some or all of their answers to be missing for questions they answered. In every case I've checked so far, all responses did get recorded in the database, but there seems to be a glitch that is occurring in some cases with the display/export of results.
 TLDR; Do not worry, your answers are safe.

 I am currently using Org mode to try and write a JET SOP/ write fantasy books or whatever. However, When trying to navigate through the text instead of going through each line, it jumps through each paragraph in chunks. 
 I know that this is due to "word wrap" and that technically it is all one giant line. But how does one change this behavior. I know a few days ago when I tested Visual Studio code I got the same issue. 
 (ignore my bad writing, this is super duper early) 
 TL:DR: how to change function of emacs to make it act more like a traditional word processor?

 Then I started using `next-buffer` and `previous-buffer` and developing an intuition for what buffer would show up.
 It's made my experience of using emacs drastically better in the same way that learning `ctrl+tab` and `ctrl+shift+tab` in web browsers made my browsing experience better. Maybe these kinds of feelings are very subjective, but I feel like this one might generalize to others experiences well.
 By default they are bound to `C-x <left>` and `C-x <right>`.
 Feel free to also share any similar other "wow this makes buffer management so much nicer feeling to use" experiences you've had.

 The :file link created by org-attach when org-attach-store-link-p is non-nil should be to the attachment, not to the original. In fact the link is to the original, not to the attachment. I believe this is a bug.
 DETAILS
 I've noticed some unexpected behavior in terms of the link that org-attach creates and places in org-stored-links when org-attach-store-link-p is non-nil. I'm seeing it when the method of attachment is move, copy, or symlink, either via org-attach-method, or when chosen directly when running C-c C-a. (I haven't tested any of the others.) The issue concerns the target of the created link.
 My expectation is that the target of such a link should point to the actual attachment itself. By that I mean, the target should be the path to the file or link in its place in th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm very new to org-mode although it already looks like something that I've been trying to invent myself (in much more lame ways) for many years.
 One thing that I don't immediately see from them the manual - is there some "standard" or well-know way to work with the outline-organized data that have multiple dimensions?
 Here is what I mean by that:
 Say, I have a lab diary where I track number of processes - each process every day:
 * Day 1 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team my notes on it ** Ongoing Experiment 1 checking out the night results, trying new approaches ** Something else ... * Day 2 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team ... ** Ongoing Experiment 1 ... ** Something else ... * Day 3 ... 
 And this is how it goes!
 So, the first dimension here is the timeline: Day 1, Day 2, ... while the second one is the processes that repeat every day.
 Clearly, depending on task, it would be handy to see this outline from the different points of view: sometimes considering the "time" dimension to be the outer one, sometimes to see the "process" dimension to be the outer:
 Time dimension is outer:
 * Day 1 ** Process 1 ** Process 2 ... * Day 2 ... 
 Process dimension is outer:
 * Process 1 ** Day 1 ** Day 2 ... * Process 2 ... 
 One can easily come up with a case of three or for dimensions like. E.g. "Date/[Home|Work]/Habit/Successes".
 Turning the tree inside out to follow the day by day progress for one of experiments would be very helpful. As well as tracking the daily successes in the second example.
 Is there a built-in feature or packages or a known workflow for such case?
 Like best practice(s) for such data organization, turning the outline inside out, making different OLAP-like views into the outline?
 thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tinkering with making simple interfaces with transient and tabulated-list-mode, things like a list of scripts with some information on them as columns, and key bindings/transients to edit, lint or execute them. While this is nice, for something more elaborate tabulated-list-mode is not enough. I am trying to get a view inspired by magit's status buffer, so I thought I could use magit-section for this. However, I couldn't find any guides on how to make something with it, and I am not savy enough to extract the exact usage from the magit code (I did try).
 So my question is, does anyone have any guides or any simple elisp code that I can use for reference to create a new derived mode out of magit-section?
 Edit: Fixed formatting.

 Latexmk: Filename '~/notes/exports/20220825222250-beamer_presentation_example.tex' contains character not allowed for TeX file. Latexmk: Stopping because of bad filename(s). 
 I believe it is because the home directory is specified with a tilde character. 
 How can I fix this error?

 I download mail with mbsync, manage it with mu4e, and send it with SMTP. This all works fine and has for years.
 Except that I find that I suddenly have to deal with email hosted on office365. It does IMAP, so I can read my mail, but it warns
 `Notice: far side store does not support flag(s) 'P'; not propagating.`
 The consequence of this is that the changes I make locally aren't reflected on the server. Refiling or deleting mail doesn't have any effect. That means my INBOX is just going to grow and grow and grow and eventually that's going to be a problem. (Nevermind that if I decide to peek at my mail from my phone or something, it's going to be a confusing mess.)
 In a previous life, I managed with davmail, but dear $DEITY in heaven, I'd really rather not have to do that again.
 Anyone know if mbsync (or the office365 account) can be configured to make things Work Right(TM)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I've recently moved my calendar need to org-mode with org-caldav after using Emacs for years for programming, writing and chatting.
 Now I wonder how/if I should do the same for Email..
 My current setup involves Kontact for IMAP and EWS.
 All the setups I've seen so far do download/sync all Emails from the IMAP server. Is it possible only download the headers and then the full emails on demand? My current setup is that I keep my Emails on the IMAP server and fetch only what I want to read.
 Akonadi does this quite good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm creating a game where several "walkers" (and other objects) are positioned on a board. ``` data Dir = N | E | S | W deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Enum, Bounded)
 data Pos = Pos { x :: Int, y :: Int} deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
 data Object = Object { pos :: Pos, dir :: Dir} deriving (Eq, Ord)
 -- An Walker is an object with a position and a direction. newtype Walker = Walker Object newtype Exit = Exit Object newtype Entry = Entry Object ```
 In order to move them, I have a function that takes a list of walkers all located on the same tile. Several walkers can be on the same tile, in which case they collide.
  -- this function takes a list of walkers with the same position. move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws = ... 
 I'm not so satisfied with this solution, because the pre-condition (all located at the same position) is not reflected. I'm thinking of several solutions to express/enforce the condition: 1. Use a guard 2. Decompose the first argument 3. Use refined types
 Use a guard
 I could use a guard to enforce my pre-condition:  move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws | isSamePos ws = ... move _ = error "All walkers must have the same position" 
 It's an OK solution, however it's a pity that the types don't help us and look clumsy.
 Decompose the first argument
 I could decompose the first argument to express the fact that they all have the same position:  move :: Pos -> [Dir] -> [Walker] move pos dirs = ... 
 It's an interesting solution because now illegal states are unrepresentable. However, I lost the idea that my inputs are walkers and not anything else.
 Use refined types
 I couldn't install Liquid Haskell, but I guess the solution would look like:  {-@ move :: SamePosList Walker -> [Walker] @-} move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws = ... 
 It seems overkill :)
 What is your opinion? Thanks!

 Several walkers can be located on the same tile, in which case they collide. To manage this, I have a function that will move them. This function takes a list of walkers all located at the same position, and calculate their next position:  -- this function takes a list of walkers that are at the same position. move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws = ... 
 I'm not very satisfied with this function, because the pre-condition (walkers must be at the same position) is not encoded in the type. I'm thinking of several solutions: 1. Encode the precondition as a guard 2. Decompose the argument 3. Enforce property with refined types
 Encode the precondition as a guard
  move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws | isSamePos ws = ... move _ = error "All walkers must be at the same position".  It's an OK solution, however it's a pity that the type doesn't help you.
 Decompose the argument
 I could decompose the list of walkers, removing the redundant part (they all have the same position):  move :: Pos -> [Dir] -> [Walker] move pos dirs = ...  That solution is interesting, because illegal states are now unrepresentable. However, I lost the idea that the input is a walker.
 Enforce property with refined types
 I could use Liquid Haskell to check the precondition using a SAT solver. I'm not quite sure how to write it, it seems a bit overkill.

 a package that i am using defines an a-list of various font properties f.e. 'family', 'weight', 'height' etc. etc.
 i want to set values to these properties progammatically, f.e. on linux + my-home-machine i would want to set 'family' to say "Iosevka Mono", on my laptop i would use a high-dpi friendly font etc.
 i wrote a trivial function like so:
  (defun util:get-host-default-font-family () "return host specific font-family" (interactive) (cond ((utils:host-name-is "host-01") Iosevka Mono") ((utils:host-name-is "host-02") "Go Mono Regular") ((t "Consolas")))) 
 the "utils:host-name-is <name-of-host>" returns 'true' when current hostname matches the provided argument, 'false' otherwise. the above function does the right thing when called interactively on different hosts. 
 however, when i use it like so
  (:default-family (util:get-host-default-font-family)) 
 i get a
  Wrong type argument: stringp, (util:get-host-default-font-family) 
 how do i fix it ?
 
 thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my config https://github.com/vidbina/dotfiles/tree/reorg-for-lit-prog/emacs#-text you may spot that I use visual-fill-column-mode and adaptive-wrap-mode to improve the readability of text in Emacs.
 ⚠️ The gotcha is that I sometimes have bits of context that I want to exclude from being "wrapped" such as tables. My current UX on this is poor as I usually want to see the table fully extended while simultaneously sneaking a peak at text in the paragraphs around it. Is there a way to do this (exclude a region from being wrapped) or is there a term that describes what I'm looking for that I should factor into my web-search queries?
 🤔 There is never really a use case where the wrapped table is even readable for me so it's just a lost piece of screen real estate when I wrap the buffer. It may as well be folded away to be conjured up through something similar to C-c C-v v where can open expanded code into a preview buffer (to see how all the noweb refs resolve). How do you deal with wrapping when tables are present? Hoping to learn what I can improve about my usage to minimize this "pain".
 💡 For now I keep toggling between the wrapped and non-wrapped states and now that I'm typing this, I'm thinking that I can open a cloned frame or buffer. That way I can show the table non-wrapped or extended in one buffer, while I look at the wrapped peripheral text in a cloned buffer and thus have a way to keep the wrapped states apart. This however does alter the layout of buffers which is again a bit of a UX killer as it disturbs the y-flow of the text in the original buffer if you catch my drift.
 Looking fwd to getting schooled. Thanks for helping think along. 🙏🏿

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Relatively new to emacs. I'm looking to use emacs speaks statistics and take advantage of using polymode and quarto mode (https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-emacs) which best I can tell is a version of polymode that allows using quarto based documents.
 So far I can build the quarto document and output a html window, but if I try to run individual chunks or pieces of code it doesn't work. The github page states it uses ESS by default but when I try to use the ESS run commands I get Wrong type argument: window-live-p, nil. I've googled this error message but haven't seen anything similar so far.
 I've also tried having polymode itself enabled with quarto mode and on its own, and using the polymode run chunks command but I get a similar error message.
 Anyone have any ideas or potential solutions?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently released Tecton, a new DSL for authoring CSS. My goal for this project is to make "CSS in PureScript" more practical for real-world use cases, meaning: * Extensive type-level validation * Minimal syntactic overhead * Broad CSS coverage * Alignment with W3C specifications * Exhaustive testing
 If you're interested to take a look, a good place to start might be the Zen Garments example, adapted from Dan Mall's CSS Zen Garden submission in order to assess the library's CSS coverage.
 From there, you might like to see some examples of CSS errors that will fail to compile. Some of these issues are significantly more complicated than e.g. providing a <length-percentage> value where a <length> was expected (although those cases are covered too).
 Hopefully the next step would be to try it out for yourself, using the large test suite as a reference wherever the (WIP) docs currently fall short.
 I am looking forward to any feedback you might have to offer! I would also like to note that contributions are welcome, so please let me know if you are interested via Twitter or [email](mailto:nick@saunde.rs); or, if you have something specific in mind already, just review the contributing guidelines and then open an issue.
 Thanks for reading!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm running multiple versions of Doom side by side and it seems that when a session fails to start properly clearing out ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/28-xxxxx makes the problem go away.
 I can only guess that the Doom sessions orChemacs2 sessions read some compiled scripts in that directory which are not compatible with them. From the Doom docs, there is an EMACSDIR environment variable that is supposed to be the ~/.emacs.d directory for that Doom session.
 After reading the docs I have decided to run doom install with --doomdir, --emacsdir, and I am also configuring the Chemacs2 ~/.emacs-profiles.el to set the relevant environment variables as described in https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/xs0avw/a_way_to_manage_multiple_doom_profiles_with/, which now includes more variables.
 Moving forward I am also adding the EMACSDIR option.
 Should these options reduce the risk of a shared ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/28-xxxxx?

 Before I jump right into learning fs2, I would like to understand its bigger picture. However, I haven't been able to find any useful information about what are the possible use cases of fs2, for what we can use this awesome library, and so on.
 To my understanding, fs2 is used when we don't know the size of the incoming data.
 I am looking for answers to these questions:
  
How does a REST-based microservice look like when it heavily relies on fs2?
 Can you suggest good learning resources for fs2? (for example: github projects...)
 What are the possible use-cases for fs2?
 Can we increase throughput by using fs2 instead of using only cats-effect? (for example in a REST-based microservice?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I’m experimenting with some pretty non-standard layouts’ configurations (using a lot of xkb features like custom types and actions) to work around some wrists problems, multiple languages/layouts I need to work with also attempting to get to a setup that doesnt break the flow (e.g. standard layouts for english and ukrainian have weirdly different placements of non-alphanumerics which doesnt help at all to internilize the physical typing habbits, etc.)
 So far its starting to look pretty well but I have the major problem with getting my multiple layouts work in Emacs.
 Given that at different times a same key on my keyboard could generate a different symbol from six different alphabets, I’m trying to understand how to get emacs bindings to work invariantly to this (well ordered) chaos.
 An idea that came to my mind was this: if emacs did have a central function that performs a key lookup - it could’ve been probably advised - in case of a failed search - to change all the latin letters in the failed to be found sequence to the ones from the other alphabet I use and rerun the search. And do it for every of the languages of interest until it either works out or finally fails.
 I wasn’t able though to confirm from the elisp reference that this is possible)
 Sorry for the probable naivety of this question - I’m really not that familiar yet with Emacs internals and not speaking from arrogance here - just trying to describe my thought process trying to both explain what I need and not to overload the reader with complexities of my setup.
 Probably there is some true and very different way to solve tgis question that I’m not aware of.
 Thank you :)

 And I am figuring out that it would be cool to develop an app for emacs that uses lilypond and the various combinations bd/snare/charley patterns to shows exercices to be worked out.
 The question is: is it affordable for someone like me, to start on such a project? I'd like to learn, but I need something motivating... And this would be it.
 Is Lisp a good idea for such a project? Or would Python be a better choice?
 If you have a few crumbs to lead me in the right direction, so that at least I start on the right path.. that'd be cool

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 I use doom emacs to edit math notes, full of latex fragments, in org mode.
 I really need to have a quick way to toggle the renderization of all fragments in a document, as if I was going to each one of them with the cursor and doing M-x org-latex-preview, which of course I have keymapped to an easier binding (SPC l p).
 I saw on the web that a way to do this would be prepending C-u to org-latex-preview (in my case C-u SPC l p). But C-u is bound to evil-scroll-up, thus preventing me to do any other combination starting with that C-u. 
 So I've been trying to disable the binding of C-u from evil-scroll-up. 
 Note: in the afterthought, that is not really what I should have been doing, because instead it would be way better to use something like SPC l l p. 
 Anyway, I tried p…]]></summary>

 I recently moved from helm-swoop to helm-occur. In helm-swoop, search results are shown in the same color that the major mode shows with syntax coloring. However, helm-occur shows search results as a single color. I checked the customize-group for both helm and helm-occur but could not find a variable for this. 
 Is there a way to make syntax coloring enabled in the helm-occur buffer?
 Thanks.

 I currently still have different directories, and have defined the keys 1-7 in dired-mode-map to open them. But of course it would be nice to just enter the first letters of the file name in Helm Mini in the case that I know the file name, which currently only works for recent files and for files in my Org directory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 This is probably quite a simple question and more to do with Emacs Lisp syntax than anything else. I'm trying to set Org's org-tag-alist variable so that a directory containing all my projects can easily have the type of project categorised according to some default tags. Unfortunately, the .dir-locals.el file uses different syntax (dot notation?) to what I'm already barely used to with regular Emacs Lisp, so I'm struggling to make it work. In particular, I'm trying to get some group tags in that variable, but I'm utterly clueless because I just haven't had the time to learn Emacs Lisp yet.
 Could anyone supply a minimum working example of a .dir-locals.el snippet that adds group tags to Org mode? Many, many thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 I've just started using Org and I am fascinated by it and the possibilities it offers over every other system I've ever tried. I've started tinkering with custom agenda views, and I've got this fairly basic custom view happening with the following code:
  (setq org-agenda-files '("~/Documents/projects")) (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("p" "Programming todos" ((tags "programming"))))) 
 Now, I have a number of projects in that projects directory whose top-level headline is marked with the WAIT TODO keyword, but whose children are marked with regular TODO. My logic here is that I want to mark an entire project as waiting or blocked without having to mark every subtree or subtask as waiting, too.
 The problem is, when I use my custom agenda view, the project headline appears (albeit greyed-out), and all its children appear. Is there a way to exclude an entire tree from appearing in a custom agenda view if its headline or one of its parents is marked with a certain keyword, in this case, WAIT?
 Thanks in advance for any help!

What would be the best way to do this in Lisp?

 I'm on a mac, and this only happens when I run emacs under screen. But I depend on screen, and do everything in a screen session, ingrained habit of decades that would be very hard to change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been using org-mode and org-roam for a bit. I'm finding that my notes are kind of getting into a mess but that's mostly because of my insane life contexts I guess.
 Here is kind of where I'm at in life, for context:
  
Work (routine stuff, development projects underway, ideas, I have a bit of a management role but it's really spread out over a bunch of contexts in and of itself (different functional areas I manage)
 Business 1
 Business 2
 Personal Life
 Personal development projects
 Education goals
 Investment goals/research
  
I like keeping notes and todos together, but I think separate contexts is a good idea so if I'm in work mode I'm not seeing all the stuff I need to do in my business. Something I'm kind of wanting to is a way to mark something as delegated to X person. I don't need them to see that I delegated it, just to remind myself that I told them to do something and to follow up.
 ​
 I started out with a regular org file for each context, then ended up creating new org files for each "thing", which created my mess. Today I decided to try creating dailies in org-roam to see how that works out.
 ​
 Any suggestions for how to keep life organized in org or org-roam when you've got so much going on. From experience, no todo list/notes manager has ever really worked that well for this for me.... a few were okay (todoist on the todo list side and evernote on the notes side.... but they both had their own issues)
 ​
 I like org and org-roam I'm just struggling with how best to setup a structure that fits such a lifestyle.
 Any thoughts or input is very welcome...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use TRAMP to connect to GitHub Codespaces via my Codespaces package. However, I noted recently that my TRAMP sessions were suffering tremendous and unignorable lag when navigating within a file. I went through my enabled modes one-by-one and was surprised to learn that vc-mode was, in this case, the culprit. Setting vc-handled-backends like so:
 (setq vc-handled-backends '(Git)) 
 had a profound effect on latency. I'm not sure why this is the case, but its original value holds a bunch of entries for VCSs that died decades ago (CVS, SCCS, RCS…): it's possible that one of my packages was using all of vc-mode's backends.
 My TRAMP sessions to Codespaces are now as responsive and fast as if I were to connect to them via VS Code. Hope this helps someone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A thought occurred to me today while I was getting ready, mentally preparing. I realized that I was feeling a bit stressed about the day but that the thought of my todo and agenda buffers had a calming effect. I thought to myself, "it's alright, you're organized and at least if there is chaos it is somewhat documented chaos and you don't have to hold it all in your mind."
 Last weekend, I took the time to do a much needed cleanup of my init.el file. I got rid of all the cruft of comments, things I'd tried but given up though not yet deleted. I made a move to using straight.el as my package manager. I switched from Ivy to Helm. I just did some things I'd been meaning to do for a while. I cleaned up my todo file and recommitted to using 'C-c a a' more throughout the day.
 I assume that many of you, like me, find a certain "gee, that's neat" quality to getting some of this working. A sense of satisfaction maybe. I like learning new ways to do things, maybe cleaner, tighter. But the thing that I keep coming back to even more than all that is that this technology, this nerdy system, has a way of calming me and making me feel better. It feels like the world has more and more information each day, more chaos, etc. Using org-mode helps me live in the world.
 I was curious to see if any of you have had similar thoughts about it?

 I'm putting together a little package to preview markdown files similarly to how they are rendered on GitHub. Previously I've used grip (and grip-mode), which are awesome, but I wanted a little more room for customization and to avoid hitting the GitHub API on every change.
 This package does the rendering locally if your Emacs has xwidget support. I'd really appreciate any feedback anyone has!

 Problem is the example projects there all use stack to import pure cabal projects, the latter of which do have mixins, but are not stack-ified themselves. In my case, I want to be able to add something to package.yaml or stack.yaml like:
 -- package.yaml (or stack.yaml) cabal-fields: mixins: base hiding (Prelude) - relude (Relude as Prelude) - relude 
 or something like that, just so that the .cabal file stack generates has this option enabled. I haven't been able to figure out how to do this. Some help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently studying Secrets of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler Inliner by Jones & Marlow (2002), and am trying to understand the "subtlety" they mention about the rapier algorithm.
 On the bottom left corner of page 7, they mention:
  
There is one other important subtlety in this algorithm: in the case where x is not in theta we must delete x from the substitution, denoted phi \ x. How could x be in the domain of the substitution, but not be in scope?
  
However, the authors do not elaborate much further due to space constraints.
 I'm trying to understand what they meant by this comment. Although I can fabricate inputs that produce the scenario they describe, I'm not sure what concrete example would lead to that input, nor why it's important to handle it the way they do.
 Also, the paper only shows two cases of their substitution algorithm that handles lambdas. Do we fall through to the second case if we fail the guard of the first case (i.e., when we match on a lambda introduces a variable already in-scope)? That is, am I correct in reading that as pseudo-Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am really new to Haskell and I came across this discussion about how closures in Haskell can be used to mimic objects in traditional OOP. 
 Needless to say, I did not understand much of the discussion. What is really confusing to me is that, if A is an instance of an object (in the traditional sense) then I can change and update some property A.property of A. This doesn't create a new instance of A, it updates the value. Exactly, how is this particular updating achieved via closures in Haskell? 
 I understand that mutability can have bad side effects and all. But if a property of an instance of an object, call it A.property for example, were to be updated many times throughout a program how can we possibly keep track of that in Haskell?
 I would really appreciate ELI5 answer if possible. Thank you for your time!!!

 On the other hand python-mode provides some functionality (like python-shell-send-buffer or python-shell-send-defun) to interact with an active, locally running python3 REPL.
 I'd like to be able to send Python code from a Python-file buffer directly (without me copying and pasting) to the MicroPython REPL.
 Any idea how to achieve that?

 I use magit quite heavily in emacs, and I'm regularly working on multiple git repositories at the same time. These are different repositories/worktrees for the same project, just with different branches checked out. I'm not sure if it is relevant, but these are Perl projects, using cperl-mode, and each project has a single TAGS files at the project root. The first time I use `M-.` (`xref-find-definitions`), I get prompted to load a TAGS file, and I select the one for the current repository I'm using. This works as expected. However when I happen to be editing a file from a different repository and hit M-., the previously loaded TAGS file is still used, so this brings me to the source file from the wrong repository. Since the files look identical, I don't notice this and regularly make edits in the wrong git worktree.
 I saw that I can load multiple tags tables using visit-tags-table, and then switch between them using select-tags-table. Is there any way to automate this so that when I use `M-.` it automatically chooses the TAGS file closest to the current file path? I looked into project.el and projectile, but I couldn't find any examples for how to do this.

However, there are limitations, for example, org-modern add space paddings to improve the visuals, which you cannot do with these two variables.
 Exactly for that reason, I will have little use for this discovery, and would rather keep it out of my .emacs.d. But hey, maybe someone would make use of this somehow :).
 You should be able to see an example also below. 
 (with-eval-after-load 'org-faces (setq org-todo-keyword-faces (append (cl-loop for todo in '("TODO" "NEXT" "STARTED" "PROJECT" "HOLD") with faces = '(:height 0.8 :inherit (org-modern-todo)) collect (cons todo faces)) (cl-loop for todo in '("CANCELLED" "DONE") with faces = '(:height 0.8 :inherit (org-modern-done)) collect (cons todo faces))) org-priority-faces (cl-loop with end = org-priority-lowest for i from org-priority-highest to end collect (list i :inherit 'org-modern-priority))))

I use it for everything. I occasionally would like a CLI tool that doesn't exist on apt, and so I build it myself. I used to use C for this, and now it's Haskell! The other day I was thinking of spinning up a chess clone because I wanted to build an AI that could beat me at chess (without looking up how chess engines work, just as a puzzle) and I thought, why not Haskell?
 Something about programming in Haskell makes me feel like a god genius programmer. She's so fast, so sleek, such a pure functional mathematical language. It's easily my favorite language by far and I just can't quite figure out what it is that makes me geek the fuck out about it.

 f :: a -> Bool
 f x = x==0 
 However, since im using the "==" operator, to tell haskell that i wont be using any other type other than the ones to which (==) has instances, Id make it this correct? 
 f :: (Eq a) => a -> Bool
 f x = x==0 
 But this throws an error telling me i also have to include (Num a) =>
 Why is that? I'm not using any operator that is in the Num a class... Why does it need this? Isn't the whole point of overloading to restrict "a" to only be a type which has an instance in the used operator/function?? What makes me add (Num a) => here too?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you look in the history of use-package you will see that support for el-get was removed but I'm wondering if maybe some of its features could still be used.
 I watched a couple videos on System Crafter's YouTube channel and I like how he can put configuration and initialization code specific for a package within the use-package construct. It seems very tidy and organized.
 I'm going to start playing with it but thought I'd see if anyone else has gotten it to work. It might be that I will need to set :ensure nil in each so use-package doesn't try to load the package since el-get will have already done it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's do it.
 What's the best style set of keybindings (in your opinion) for Emacs, and "Why?".
 Background:
  
I ask this since I have a keybinding to easily switch to Vim style keybindings a la 'Evil Mode', but only do so for programming purposes. 
 Everywhere else I use Emacs style keybindings (Org Mode, etc).
 I also use a few custom Hydras as well for weird things like buffer rotation, etc.
  
Curious what you crazy Emacs wizards use these days (ex: Xah Fly Keys, etc). Feel free to provide the "What" you use individual keybinding sets for as well.
 Let's have at it, let the best keybindings win! :)

 While I love org-mode, and would much rather use it than any other option, I still have a hard time because I manage a lot of my tasks through my phone. Same for content consumption, I do a lot on my phone thus cannot save anything easily in org.
 I've tried orgzly, but it does not really fit me. 
 How do you manage all that ?
 Thanks !

 The rust code are mainly borrowed from agreety. And I am using the Emacs Module in Rust crate here.
 For those who are not familar with greetd. greetd is a minimal, agnostic and flexible login manager daemon.

 Is everyone just locked on 8.6 or earlier like we are?
 It seems like https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs/issues/821 is a rigid dealbreaker for any sizable project.
 Our setup of using a hybrid of ghcjs-8.6, ghc-8.6 and ghc-8.10 works well enough, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't being heavily stress tested.
 I'm hoping that ghc-9.6 can potentially come to the rescue with a JS backend, but I was curious if there are other solutions on the horizon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just thought I'd document this fix here.
 I have Emacs running portably on Dropbox through a batch script that sets the HOME environment variable:
 REM Set the environment variable HOME, which Emacs uses as the base directory. set HOME=%~dp0 REM Run Emacs, passing any parameters to it as well. "D:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\emacs-28.1\bin\runemacs.exe" %* 
 I began getting this error whenever I tried to list ELPA packages:
 Failed to verify signature archive-contents.sig: No public key for _____________ created at 2022-10-18T08:05:04+1100 using RSA Command output: gpg: keyblock resource '/d/Dropbox/Apps/emacs/.emacs.d/d:/Dropbox/Apps/emacs/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/pubring.kbx': No such file or directory gpg: Signature made Tue Oct 18 08:05:04 2022 AUSEST gpg: using RSA key _________________ gpg: Can't check signature: No public key 
 My googling led me to this Stack Exchange thread which noted that this was caused by the homedir expansion producing an invalid directory path.
 The fix in my init.el is therefore:
 (setq package-gnupghome-dir "elpa/gnupg") 
 This creates the keys in the directory that Emacs expects (.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/) and allows the whole thing to work.

However, the values associated with a key in the alist are persistent across function calls, even though I reset the alist in a let form (and, well, it's inside a function!). Here is a minimal working example. Calling my/test multiple times continually increases the alist values:
 (defun my/test () (let ((my/alist '((a . 0) (b . 0)))) (incf (alist-get 'a my/alist)) (incf (alist-get 'b my/alist)) my/alist)) 
 What am I doing wrong? Something tells me the problem is with incf, but I cannot understand how my/alist is stored in memory, since it should have its scope inside the function and be reset when let is run.

 Can we great a type of unknown amount of .... data?
 I know with record syntax we can create 
 data somedata ={ sum:: String, sum:: Int}
 What's stopped me from using Haskell for my everyday data science projects was with record syntax I would to modify things so the types and headers to the csv files matched.
 Which is a pain if I am just wanting to download data and play with it.
 Is there a way to create types, say similar to a Dataframe in Python or R where you can turn a CSV to a DataFrame?

Anyone do this today, or have advice on how to configure Eglot for the kernel? All I have ever used is cscope and ctags. I'd like to get it working so that the LSP server picks up the correct headers for the build arch and picks up all the GCC flags.
 I also usually run my builds inside of a container so I don't use my system's gcc toolchain.
 I am not an Emacs wizard, so detailed instructions for an idiot are most welcome.

 I decided to propose a Haskell devroom (like a one/half-days pecialist track or miniconf) for FOSDEM 2023, to be held February 4--5 in Brussels (main site; call-for-devrooms). It would be great to promote Haskell among this audience and hopefully attract new contributors / community members.
 Unfortunately I left it quite late (deadline submission is today). I only just realised I need a secondary contact (i.e. co-organiser) to submit the proposal. So... any volunteers?
 Ideally you are located in Europe or definitely planning to attend FOSDEM. If you are willing, please message me here on Reddit or mail frase at frase dot id dot au. I think I all need right now is your name and email address (and enthusiasm).
 The text of my proposal may be found at https://github.com/frasertweedale/talks/blob/master/2022-02-xx-fosdem-haskell-devroom/proposal.md.
 I have experience organising and hosting FP miniconfs at linux.conf.au including running the CFP etc. I expect FOSDEM will be similar, just on the other side of the world from Australia, where I live.
 Thank you!

 No problem, I thought, I'll just create a parallel directory structure and symlink things in places, and then import that into lsp. However, at some point in the process of importing the project (based on Maven pom files) it canonicalises some paths and ends up importing the original directory structure.
 I realise this is more of an underlying Eclipse issue, rather than an Emacs one, but does anybody have a good suggestion for how to work round this?

 The issue is that when the file is moved, the buffer opened doesn't really know about it and after any change in the buffer and then save, the file gets saved into old location.
 How do I associate a buffer with new location? I found somewhere that I can use `write-file` function and it suppose to change "the pointer" to file but it didn't. It does write to specified location but save-buffer still saves it into old file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve spent some time this summer extending Monad-Bayes, a
probabilistic programming library in Haskell. This was done in the context of a
Tweag open source fellowship, under the supervision of Dominic Steinitz. These
improvements are part of the upcoming 1.0 release of the library.
Briefly, what’s Monad-Bayes about? Like Church, Gen and
Pyropyro (among other probabilistic programming languages), it allows a user
to specify a Bayesian model as a program, and automates the process of
inferring the specified distribution. Unlike other languages, it is a
first-class library of its host language (Haskell), rather than an embedded
language. This means that any language feature in the host language is
available to you. It also means that you can have distributions over absolutely
anything. For in…]]></summary>

 Does anybody know of any good resources that go over what the general design patterns are, best practices, and tips on debugging?
 (Search engines haven't been much help as most combinations of 'emacs' and 'C code' lead to results about configuring Emacs as an IDE for C)
 I am pretty familiar with Emacs-Lisp, and I can write and understand C pretty well, but I would like to get a good understanding of all the Emacs-specific things I'm seeing in the C code, such as how to go from C variables and structs to Lisp objects, the DEFUN macro, etc.
 The motivation behind this is that, as noted in a previous post, I've noticed that the xwidget-webkit feature is (partially) broken in the latest version for MacOS. I would like to try out some possible fixes: it looks like most issues are simply due to the fact that many functions are only defined for the GTK framework, and not Mac's NextStep/Cocoa framework.
 Also, if anybody wants to help out with this effort, please let me know.
 ​
 UPDATE:
  
if you're interested in understanding Emacs C source-code, take a look at this section of the official manual: I found the part about Writing Emacs Primitives especially helpful. Many thanks to u/7890yuiop!!!
 If you're interested in the xwidget patches I'm working on, I've created this fork of the emacs mirror. I don't know if I'll be able to fix everything, but it's looking good and I've already implemented the estimated-load-progress function

 https://github.com/keithfancher/haskell-notes/blob/master/haskell-notes.md
 These are some notes I started taking about Haskell, specifically about topics I found confusing or which seemed to have many disparate sources of documentation. There's stuff about installation, toolchain, and of course some oddities of the language itself. It collects some basic summaries of the info that I've gleaned so far and a bunch of links to stuff written by people a lot more knowledgeable than I am.
 Of course, to reiterate: I am a beginner. So take it all with a grain of salt! But that can also be useful, since I probably have a similar perspective to all the other beginners out there.
 Also note that it's a work in progress! It'll grow as I continue to learn (and write down) new stuff.
 Anyway, hope this helps somebody!

 I am learning Haskell because I've heard so many great things. I had heard of the language before but Software Unscripted has inspired me to pursue it seriously and dedicate some time to it. 
 So far it's really interesting! I've not had that "ah-ha!" moment but it's only been a week or so. 
 One thing I'm wondering: Can I change the cabal output directory? 
 Right now the output goes to:
  /home/chris/projects/MyPackage-CLI/dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-9.0.2/MyPackage-CLI-0.1.0.0/x/MyPackage-CLI/build/MyPackage-CLI/MyPackage-CLI 
 That is a mouthful lol! I suppose it doesn't matter until I need to deploy (thanks to cabal run) but I am curious to know if I can just have a ~/projects/MyPackage-CLI/bin/MyPackage-CLI -- or something like that. 
 Any ideas? I've searched around and mostly I've found ways of changing cabal itself, not the output or bin directory. 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[#include <iostream> int main(){ int userInput; int inputAnother; std::cout << "enter a num : "; std::cin >> userInput; std::cout << "enter another: "; std::cin >> inputAnother; std::cout << userInput << "+" << inputAnother << " is " << userInput+inputAnother << "\n"; std::cout << userInput << "-" << inputAnother << " is " << userInput-inputAnother << "\n"; return 0; } 
  
In emacs i got this indentation in a file. When i clicking tab it was directly going 15 space forward after std::cout << "enter another: ";. The situation persist in just one file. Any idea what did this happen?

 I just released a fork of all-the-icons-completion. I've added support for more completion categories (imenu, M-x, and more) by taking code from all-the-icons-ivy-rich. I've also added a few quality of life improvements, like proper icon aligning and scaling (once again ported from all-the-icons-ivy-rich). If you use all-the-icons-completion I'd recommend giving my fork a try.

 A specific combination of things makes lsp-mode (with lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode) cause lines below the cursor to move. Those circumstances are: 
  
Using one of the themes from Prot's package ef-themes
 
cc-mode with lsp-mode, lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode 
  
There is no problem with the identical configuration using haskell/lsp-haskell or python/lsp-pyright or any other language. 
 Nor is there a problem using a different theme e.g. modus-vivendi 
 This video shows 3 short clips to demonstrate the problem. 
  
theme: ef-dark, editing a C file showing the unwanted movement
 
identical setup after using counsel-load-theme and choosing modus-vivendi- no unwanted movement
 
theme: ef-dark, but editing a haskell file again using lsp-mode with lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode - no unwanted movement
 
 I'm stuck now and looking for ideas to help me discover what could cause this and how to fix it.

 #+TODO: TODO WAIT | DONE * TODO This is a test :work: * WAIT This is another test :work: 
 Run (org-tags-view nil "work+TODO=\"WAIT\"") and you will see, as expected, an agenda view containing only the task tagged "WAIT". 
 Quit the agenda and call org-todo-list, then run org-agenda-filter, and enter work+TODO="WAIT" at the prompt. Do you get the exact same result? I had assumed I would, but I do not. Instead I get this message: 
 ‘+TODO’ filter ignored because tag/category is not represented 
 So, questions: 
  
Is this as it should be? 
 Is there a way of using org-agenda-filter to filter out tasks with a specific todo keyword?
  
I realize I could do this: 
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("p" "Test" tags "+work+TODO=\"WAIT\""))) 
 or perhaps use org-agenda-filter-by-regexp. My question is just whether org-agenda-filter should allow me to find all entries with a particular todo keyword, and if not, I guess I'd want to know why not?

I pop the disk into my computer; and while the computer recognizes it, it says the disk is unreadable. So I Google what emacs even is. He was into coding, and was even trying to create his own pixel art computer game thing. I figure the backup could be related to that kind of stuff.
 How do I get this CD to open? I installed emacs on my computer (I think?) and nothing changed? 
 (I do realize he could have also used it as a journal. Honestly, I want answers to questions, and I'll never get them, now. Part of me hopes it is his journal. I'm already in therapy so it would just be one more thing to discuss, I guess. I won't let my mom know. I'm desperate. Thank you.)

I set up my environment following the course but it seems that my code is trying to compile Scala 2 rather than Scala 3.
 When I run the following code in IntelliJ: 
 val x = 10 if x < 0 then println("negative") else if x == 0 then println("zero") else println("positive") 
 I get this error:
 /Users/myname/Desktop/miscellaneous/courses/functional_programming_principles/scala-project/src/main/scala/example/example.worksheet.sc:3:4 '(' expected but identifier found. if x < 0 then 
 When I run scala --version in my terminal I get Welcome to Scala 3.2.0 (11.0.16.1, Java OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM) and my REPL also works in Scala 3. 
 I'm sure this is related but I'm not sure how to fix it:
  
In IDEA, under External Libraries, OpenJDK 18 and Scala SDK 2.13.10 are listed.
  
Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks
 EDIT: I fixed the issue by simply starting a new project and following the IDEA new project wizard. Helped me select the JDK and Scala version that I wanted. Thanks!

Overall, things are working pretty well, but I'm having trouble when using *Buffer List* (you know, the buffer menu invoked with C-x C-b or :ls<cr>).
 When I use C-h k o, for example, it shows the proper mapping defined in evil-collection: o is mapped to tabulated-list-sort.
 However, if I use C-h m, it says o is "Select that buffer in another window". And when I invoke which-key-show-mode, is says o is mapped to Buffer-menu-other-window.
 Am I missing something here? Is there a package that "glues" all the help systems together?

 Consumption of social media typically necessitates few repeated actions - like, share, comment and follow. If these actions are assigned to convenient keyboard keys, the consumption becomes easier. Here's an attempt to unify this experience using GNU Emacs and tumblesocks.

 I have all of the above installed --- and working. With Golang, the functions autocomplete with the parenthesis and placeholders for the args, as expected. So the plumbing works.
 But, when working with Javascript (with ts-ls), the functions and methods autocomplete without parenthesis or placeholders. So, for exemple, "document.querySel" autcompletes to "document.querySelector" -- NOT "document.querySelector(selectors)" or something like that.
 Again: yasnippet is installed and working and the entire thing works in other languages. Does anyone know why it doesn't work with Javascript?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a novice emacs user. In an attempt to set the font in my init.el file, I came across two different functions: set-fontset-font and set-frame-font.
 set-frame-font sets the font of current frame correctly, whereas set-fontset-font doesn't do anything. To my understanding, invoking (set-fontset-font t ...) is basically modifying the default font set, making new frames to use the font I specified, so this behavior is surprising to me.
 I frequently fiddle with code that contains non-alphanumeric characters (Hangul, Hiragana/Katakana, Emoji...), and I use different fonts for each of them. It would be great if I can use set-fontset-font as that function has this feature built-in. Is there a way to make it a one-function-to-rule-them-all?
 P.S. I tried modifying default-frame-alist with (font . "fontset-default") but apparently that is not allowed? Now my init.el is broken!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Doom emacs, with Evil mode.
 I am learning using Org Mode and I wanted to cycle through single Headlines by using the Tab key but what I can only cycle through is the first level under the Headline I am pressing the Tab key upon.
 To clarify, I don't want to use the S-Tab to cycle through all Headlines, but I only want to cycle through one Headline and its sub-headlines.
 How can I cycle through all nested Headlines, one by one, with evil mode
 I am sorry if that's a pretty noob question. Thank you all for your help
 Edit: I've found in the manual a workaround (which is actually the official combo key for the action I was looking for) by using C-c C-k. That key combo will expand all subtrees of a headline, recursively. To close the main headline back, I'll use za.
 Sadly, default vim z operations in evil-org look not working. E.G. zO is supposed to perform the operation I was looking for, or zr doesn't open one subtree at a time.
 Edit 2: In the lang: org README file from Doom Emacs I see that this behavior was intentional and that can be reversed.
  
 TAB was changed to toggle only the visibility state of the current subtree, rather than cycle through it recursively. This can be reversed with:  #+begin_src emacs-lisp (after! evil-org (remove-hook 'org-tab-first-hook #'+org-cycle-only-current-subtree-h)) #+end_src

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past month I've been working on implementing my first OOP language with Haskell .. implementing the syntax and context analysis was very easy for me because I'm very aware of the fact that we build parsers using stateful monads using one of the already available libraries (like parsec for example)... so that went easy after defining the context-free grammars that is not left-recursive, and then implementing the parsec-functions to every non-terminating symbol in the grammars... so that went easy with no hiccups... 
 But after I dived into the context analysis that's where shit hit the fan.. it seemed that my programming model has either been very bad or I'm a bad software-engineer because functions started to become very ugly due to many parameters that are passed to the functions, and many other reasons that I don't how to start to explain, but in summary whatever makes haskell beautiful I managed to make it very ugly and complicated with my architecture design..
 So my question is: we already have stateful monads and parsers like parsec as an architectural model to implement the syntax analysis and context analysis. Are there also standardized models to implement the other steps in compilers like the context analysis? Is there literature that answers this question in regard to Haskell?
 Edit: while implementing the context analysis I became very aware of the fact that need zippers because I needed to be very aware ot the context of every variable and method which then I did and made the job much easier, so maybe that's part of the answer that I'm seeking?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love orgmode, have been using it for years at this point throughout my undergraduate years and for most personal projects.
 However, I've been more involved with working closely with other developers. How do you guys manage using orgmode alongside other project management platforms like Trello, Monday.com, Notion, Jira, etc? It's really hard having to check for tickets or items assigned to me on those platforms and then updating them manually on orgmode.
 Are my days of using orgmode over or relegated to just personal projects?

 I run Emacs on a Mac. I install it via homebrew. I install packages with straight-use-package. INFOPATH isn't defined in my environment.
 When I enter Info in the usual way (C-h i) what I see is not optimal.
  
There is no entry for Emacs Lisp, among others.
 There are things for which there is no actual Info help. Example: "Info-find-file: Info file ‘ada-mode’ does not exist; consider installing it"
 There are almost 350 lines in the top level of Info and it is full of things I don't care about, such as EUDC, 'Gawk work flow', and 22 separate entries for things in GNU Gettext Utilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "snapshot" binaries of Emacs 29 for Windows posted today should be somewhat less fragile while running without GCC/libgccjit (e.g. MSYS2 installed and on the Windows path).
 https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-29/?C=M;O=D
 Note: the snapshot is dated Oct 13, 2022, but I posted it today, Oct 15th; took me a few days. The last included commit was cbd04ad3d572850775f18bde868c71abcde733ed.
 Anyway, this build use a new "trampolines" target for make. This target pre-compiles (AOT) trampolines, infrastructure that allows natively compiled elisp to call redefined elisp primitives, which are then included with the installer, zip and no-deps.zip distributables. While redefining primitives is discouraged, it does happen, especially via advice APIs.
 Including these trampolines should enable installing and running (e.g.) packages that advise elisp primitives. Previously (in all 29 snapshots and GNU windows binary distributions of Emacs 28) that might have failed because Emacs unconditionally creates trampolines on the fly if they do not exist when needed. Precompiling the trampolines should prevent Emacs from triggering async native compilation even when native-comp-available-p was returning nil, to make them.
 TIA for bug reports & feedback!
 PS, in case others are building Emacs with native comp enabled and not distributing GCC/libgcc with, the new make target isn't on the Emacs 28 branch (yet). It should be fairly easy to patch it in or manually add something like this to your packaging process after success of make all, before make install (or make install-strip or whtv)
  (mapatoms (λ (f) (when (subr-primitive-p (symbol-function f)) (or (comp-trampoline-search f) (comp-trampoline-compile f))))) 
 This code comes from message #50 in bug #58318, and worked for me (however, the 29 snapshot binaries do use the new make target, now - they don't use the above snippet).
 Edit: un-mangled the code block

 I copied what I found in the EmacsWiki into my init file, changing calendar to diary-mail-entries:
 (require 'midnight)
 (midnight-delay-set 'midnight-delay "4:30am")
 (add-hook 'midnight-hook 'diary-mail-entries)
 My problem is, not only do I get email at 4:30am but each and every time I start emacs.
 If anyone knows what I may be doing wrong or how to correct this I would appreciate it.
 Thank you

 When I use control +/- I can only zoom in up to the font size I set in ~/.doom.d/config.el (doom user here) then it just says "The font hasn't been resized" (not big of an explanation).
 I zoom out and on the right bottom corner it tells me how many "steps" I zoomed back ( (-1), (-2), etc.), and when I press C-+ even just one time it takes me back to "0" ie the default font size I set.
 This what I have in my config regarding fonts.
 ;; ----------- FONTS ----------- ;; main font stuff (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Comic Mono" :size 24) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Ubuntu" :size 24) doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Comic Mono" :size 24)) ;; make italics and bold show without the slash and asterisk (not working) (after! doom-themes (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t doom-themes-enable-italic t)) ;; italic comments and keywords (not working) (custom-set-faces! '(font-lock-comment-face :slant italic) '(font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic)) 
 I'm sorry if the question is high noobeness, I'm not very practical with this and I don't have any idea of how to move forward. I love editing org files in emacs though, so these headaches are worth it.
 Thank you all.

One of the greatest difficulties in understanding the Zettelkasten Method is to separate its specific characteristics from actual knowledge work. Or, how I like to phrase it: “Link knowledge, not notes.” Working with our Zettelkasten is the physical (or digital) manifestation of our thinking. It provides a framework that allows us to think through writing and to create an increasingly complex thinking machine that can help us think deeper than being on our own. The Zettelkasten Method provides a framework for our thinking, but does not prescribe what and how we think.

Start typing @ and get an auto-complete helm box with all the people I have in the system. Selecting one would should the nickname I defined for them in this sytem
 Have a capture template (for example when creating a meeting) where I can select the people I have in the system (multi-select) and assign them to a "with" property under the meeting heading
 Click on a @-link and see all the headings under which this person is mentioned.
 Assign a TODO to someone and later see all the TODOs by them (today I do this with tags but it doesn't work well with people with the same first names unless my tags keep a @first_lastname pattern for everyone) Closest I have seen so far is this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/64502 but it's part of a much more complex package which seems overkill. Plus, I don't see how I could easily use with a capture template.
  
Any ideas? Thanks!

 If core domain object is near service and repository then that module must include the dependency to the SQL or other database library. Now if your other project doesn't use SQL but they need your core object it will drag all the libraries with it.
 If you separate out the core domain class into a submodule that doesn't contain any dependencies, then you can import that to other projects, but then it's suddenly not package-by-feature. Or can we achieve a hybrid model where the core object is separate and then all the rest, SQL, HTTP, API, JSON are in one other module that is the app.

 trait XXXXCommands[R] extends ReplyType[R] { override type ReplyType = Rtype Context = XXXXEntity#CommandContext[ReplyType]type State =XXXXStatetype Persist = XXXXEntity#Persist def apply(ctx: Context, stateOpt: Option[State]): Persist = {stateOpt match {case None => initial(ctx)case Some(state) if state.XXXXStatus == XXXXStatus.Success => success(ctx, state)}} protected def rejectByStatus(ctx: Context, state: State): XXXXEntity#Persist = {ctx.invalidCommand(s"${this.getClass.getSimpleName}: Invalid operation. {Id: ${state.XXXXId}, Status: ${state.XXXXStatus}")ctx.done} protected def reject(message: String, ctx: Context): XXXXEntity#Persist = {ctx.invalidCommand(message)ctx.done} protected def initial(ctx: Context): XXXXEntity#Persistprotected def success(ctx: Context, state: State): XXXXEntity#Persist} 
 I am using (or trying to use) Lagom framework. Persist is a trait that is inside of the PersistentEntity trait. Because of the the inner traits I tried to take the Persist inside the Entity that I created via hash (#) operation. That may be the problem.
 I dont know how could I fix it but its so weird to have that problem. This would exactly work in java but why it did not in scala?
 Edit:
 It happens when I try to run the code below.
 override def behavior: Behavior = Actions().onCommand[XXXXCommand, XXXXCreatedReply] { case (cmd: XXXXCommand, ctx, state) => cmd.apply(ctx, state) }

In the coming weeks I'm considering releasing my hyper-minimal take on Zettelkasten to a wider audience. My rationale has always been to squash complexity in favor of a quick & lightweight method of retrieving notes (nothing at all wrong with other apps that have all the bells & whistles btw). The same codebase runs on any of Windows, Linux, BSD (Apple likely to be included soon as well) with zero issues.
Some screen shots...



The interface as you noticed is commandline driven & features a REPL (Read Evaluate Print & Loop) to process commands. As it stands now, the source code is merely 27 Kilobytes in size & would be great to toss on a USB drive so your notes are easy to access. No smartphone interface as I'm not much interested in that domain. At any rate, if this sounds like something you might be interested in, check in every now & again & I'll hopefully post a download link eventually.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I want to write a simple converter from lambda calculus expressions to SKI expressions using these 6 rules. I have my two types
 data Expr = Var String | Abs String Expr | App Expr Expr data SKI = S | K | I | App SKI SKI 
 With these types, rule 5 does not quite work using general recursion:
 general :: Expr -> SKI general (Abs v1 (Abs v2 e)) | free v1 e = general (Abs v1 $ general (Abs v2 e)) 
 Understandably, this doesn't work because Abs requires its second arg to be an Expr but general returns SKI.
 I've tried implementing it using various recursion schemes (futu, histo, para and ana), but to no success. Is there a way to do this without having to merge the two types together into one?
 And additionally, if something can't be implemented using general recursion, can it be implemented using recursion schemes? Or is general recursion strictly "more powerful"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found that completing-read + embark-act-all rocks. For example, I can update all lsp-related package in straight.el by calling straight-pull-package and then type lsp- to get a list of completion candidates with lsp in the name. Then I call embark-act-all and pull all the selected packages.
 But it would be useful to be able to switch from an arbitrary completing-read minibuffer into completing-read-multiple via a key-press, collect multiple candidates (which don't necessarily have matching substrings), and then just run the original command for each of the selected candidates, e.g. via embark-act-all. This would be much more convenient than just running the command multiple times or what I sometimes do, mapping the function over the list in elisp (M-: (seq-map #'<command> candidates))
 I could write my own function which calls completing-read-multiple, like straight-pull-package-crm, but it would be nice if something like that would be possible from any command. I'm asking because I thought something like that should already exist somewhere or be possible somehow with existing functionality in emacs/embark.
 Feel free to propose other solutions to my problem, as what I'm asking might be an XY problem.

I'm not new to the JVM; I've done previous work in Java (1.6/Android) and spent a large chunk of time writing Clojure. My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I'll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I'd feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I've also been there and done that, and I like types now. Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We're a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. I'm looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general. I'm not opposed to pragmatism either; it's one thing I like about Scala. It seems like there's a lot of excellent libraries because of the existing JVM ecosystem. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To me, I've always thought that data constructors should have a lowercase first letter, because they are term-level and behave very similarly to functions. For example,
 data T = D Int f :: Int -> T f = D 
 Here, f and D are very similar conceptually, so why should they be represented differently?
 I've read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6237775/why-does-haskell-force-data-constructors-first-letter-to-be-upper-case but the only compelling argument to me seems to be pattern matching, since data constructors can be matched on but functions cannot. However as someone who learnt haskell recently it seems to me that it would be clearer if data constructors had a lower case first letter to make clear their term-levelness.
