And do you mostly edit templates/wordpress sites or are you working with more software engineering oriented frameworks like Symfony or Laravel?
 Is there anything you wish to see improved when using emacs for development of PHP applications? A feature you're missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After I invoke org capture to create a journal entry, the cursor is position at the start of the entry, prior to the timestamp, instead of after it. In other words, as soon as the capture is done, I cannot start writing the entry, but have to move the cursor to the end of the line before I can start typing. Why does it happen?
 The following is what I have in my configuration for org-capture-templates.
  ("j" "Journal entry" plain (function org-journal-find-location) "** %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)\n%?" :empty-lines 2 :jump-to-captured t :immediate-finish t) 
 where org-journal-find-location is defined as follows.
  (defun org-journal-find-location () ;; Open today's journal, but specify a non-nil prefix argument in order to ;; inhibit inserting the heading; org-capture will insert the heading. (org-journal-new-entry t) (unless (eq org-journal-file-type 'daily) (org-narrow-to-subtree)) (goto-char (point-max))) 
 These are based on the example snippets from org-journal repository.
 I thought the use of "%?" following the newline should force the cursor to be placed after the headline (containing the timestamp), but it does not. What am I overlooking?

learning new areas / tools that previously you'd have to ask a frontend/UI or an infra specialist to really make a reasonable MVP, but now you can chain a few artifacts in claude and then pass it off to a specialist for them to productionize.

But, again and again, i feel like my Emacs configuration reaches a point where it starts to feel "fragile". I've been working on mine on and off for some time now and, in general, i really like where i'm at.
 But the i try adding in Treemacs and it's a hassle to make that change. Just adding it in with use-package results in "treemacs loaded before elpaca". So, `:ensure (:wait t)` seems to solve that. Now treemacs works. As soon as i add a `:bind` to the setup, the treemacs buffer opens empty and i get `Error in post-command-hook (treemacs--post-command): (wrong-type-argument markerp nil)`. Without keybind it's fine. This is just one example.
 I look around and see really elaborate configurations with major customizations that seem to work flawlessly for those people. But for me, it quickly reaches a point where things start behaving differently from what i would expect.
 I'm close to starting over (again) as i feel that i've lost control over that configuration. And i don't even know why.

 How can I check if reverting should actually work? Or do I missunderstand auto-reverting of buffers in Emacs?

 I'm really excited to announce the release of Dunai 0.13.1 and Bearriver 0.14.10!
 Dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. Dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants.
 Dunai comes with:
  
bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 
dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.
 
 See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai#features for details on Dunai's features.
 This release fixes an issue with the dependency on the list-transformer library as an alternative to transformers. Thanks to @ tomsmeding for the contribu…]]></summary>

our interests and expertise have become significantly broader over the years, our love
for immutable, composable and typed architecture have made functional
programming and programming languages in general an important part of our DNA.
This long-standing activity was formalized last year as the Programming
Languages & Compilers Group. The PL&C group has been busy in the
second quarter of 2024, and this post is a summary of what we’ve been doing.
Our involvement varies depending on the availability of each team member and

 This is a freshly compiled Emacs, ran with -Q and rust-mode + eglot, nothing more. You can see on the screenshot that the minibuffer shows only the first line of eldoc (C-h .) - it cuts the rest off even though max-mini-window-height isn't the problem. I want it to also include the second line with the type information (I want it because I hate inlay-hints and I turn them off). I spent some time doing research and I found this package https://github.com/emacsmirror/eglot-signature-eldoc-talkative that seems to be related but it didn't do what I wanted. Based on it I tried to do some things but honestly I'm a pretty bad Emacs user and I have no idea what I'm doing.

But this journey also became one of very personal development as I continue to find additional productivity techniques, psychological insights, etc. that are helping me be a better me. And the ZK method seems well suited for also keeping track of those things.
Is there some wisdom in keeping the things separate? Or do you just let it all live together?
What about journaling? I ask that because my "personal development" stuff can veer closer to "journaling" than "business research," but journaling (and dream journaling) feels like it shouldn't be anywhere near my ZK.]]></summary>

 Is there a way to highlight the active window by coloring the border like in many tilling window managers (here i3 from a random video on yt)
 All the solutions I found are about changing the color of the background / modeline. I don't want to change the background (auto-dim-other-buffers.el do the job) and I already have a dynamic modeline color but it's not enough for me to quickly see where i am.

 1. Install Emacs and AUCTeX
  
Emacs: Download and install Emacs from [GNU Emacs]() or use your package manager if you're on Linux.
 AUCTeX: Install AUCTeX through Emacs' package manager: 
 Open Emacs and type M-x package-refresh-contents RET.
 Then, install AUCTeX with M-x package-install RET auctex RET.
 
  
2. Install ConTeXt LMTX
  
Download ConTeXt LMTX from the [Pragma ADE website]().
 Extract the archive and place the folder in a location of your choice.
  
This is what I did and it seems that AUCTex is installed.
 however, I dont know where to go from here, do i need anything else? is there a way to get started with making ConTeXt work on emacs? I have the context-win64 folder in C:\ConTeXt\context-win64 as I was instructed in the directions to make a folder for win64

Swimming with Ideas
This is yet another opportunity to share what you are working on with your friends here on the forum. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I'd love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Here is my report on why I'm here and my current ZK work themes and ideas:
Exploring feminism as a man.
Working on the concept of creating thinking canvases.
I'm thinking a lot about automation.
I'm back in university for the semester and taking a journalism writing class with a bunch of young people.
Thinking about the "Theory of Maximum Taste" and how to apply it to note-taking.
My reading is very much related to reading and writing.
Books I'm reading or read this week:
Adler, Mortimer Jerome and Van Doren, Charles Lincoln. How to read a book. 2014.[[202407311603]]
Fadiman, Anne. Ex Libris: Confessions of a Common Reader. Unabridged, Recorded Books, 1999. Audiobook Everand
Blundell, William E. The Art and Craft of Feature Writing: Based on the Wall Street Journal Guide. New American Library, 1988.
Strunk, William, and E. B. White. The Elements of Style. 4th ed, Allyn and Bacon, 1999.
Froke, Paula, et al., editors. The Associated Press Stylebook, 2022-2024. 56th edition, Basic Books, 2022.

The "My rolling twelve-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to see, discuss, or critique any of these notes.

 It gives you code completion (using *Completions* buffer), syntax highlighting (according to the article below), and it can pass those code completion candidates to normal emacs buffer.
 Run M-x run-python, create a new buffer with python-mode, AND you will have context aware code completion in your buffer (try it)
 BUT it does NOT give you code navigation, cause it doesn't integrate with xref, and it's not a full terminal emulator.
 I read the source code of comint.el, python.el, shell.el and found this brilliant article: https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/comint-writing-command-interpreter
 Main problem (besides xref), that i have with comint is that it is dumb terminal (as opposed to xterm-256color terminal), meaning it isn't a full terminal emulator.
 It doesn't interpret ANSI escape sequences, essentially only supporting raw input and output.
 So my question is: Why is that? And how do i fix that?
 To be clear emacs does have full terminal emulators like vterm or ansi-term.
 But i think it would be awesome to have those advantages that comint already has and also have a perfect development environment for creating tui programs.
 I hope this post doesn't feel like a rant or is unclear. I'm interested in emacs architecture design, and want to learn from it.

 Sorry for bad formatting, I'm blaming the android app.
 I've recently had the pain of working with tramp over a slow connection and noticed that minibuffer completion during find-file on a remote path was painfully slow, constanly freezing, and sometimes triggered forbidden reentrant calls.
 I put my poor emacs debugging skills to the task and noticed a large number of test -e ... commands going through tramp, coming from a large number of calls to file-exists-p on remote paths triggered by the completion (was using fido at the time). This seems to hurt other completion packages that are based around completing-read from what I could tell (tested a bit with vertico).
 I tried ido instead and it was blazingly fast in comparison. I couldn't find anything about this through basic googling so thought I'd ask here: I see vertico and friends being recommended here a lot, and while I generally prefer these alternatives over ido, not playing nice with tramp is a pretty big pain point. Anyone has any workaround or config tips to tackle this that don't involve applying super deep advices?

My guest this time will be the creator of Scala himself - Martin Odersky.

 P.S.: I'm trying to figure out RSS (this is a bit simpler) and Apple podcasts + Spotify podcasts by popular demand, it's just painfully slow due to everything being very legalese.
 P.S.2: I got rid of the boom arm and my microphone will be positioned centrally so there should be no more issues with my audio being skewed towards the left channel (I do read YouTube comments!).
 P.S.3: you can also write your questions about Lean Scala down here in comments and I'll try to discuss them with Martin on the podcast!

Applied to Zettelkasten
Imagine each node in the graph is a note in your Zettelkasten.
Imagine each edge in the graph is a link from one note to another. (We actually would need arrows/directed connections)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I've been recently trying to get more intentional about treating Emacs Lisp like 'any other programming language' and so I have a question about package development.
 Let's say that you are developing two packages that depend on different versions of the same package. You are using Eask/Cask/Eldev/Keg/etc and so you have two projects: foo and bar that both depend on some third package baz, but one of them is 'stuck' at an earlier version. The packages are otherwise unrelated. For the argument's sake, you cannot upgrade. How do you get completion, documentation, jump to definition etc pointing at the correct version of baz? Do you clear up your load path every time you switch between the projects?
 Or to put question differently, when you develop foo.el, how do you get elisp completion and documentation relevant only to what foo.el should be able to access and not to anything defined in your configuration? Right now if I open any .el file elisp-completion-at-point will happily suggest any function or variable that I ever defined in init.el. I can of course start a new session and load only foo.el . But then I lose all my customization to get accurate completions.
 This is a pretty common scenario within the larger programming ecosystem and most languages/tools handle it without the developer ever thinking about it, but I have not seen anything on the topic in Emacs Lisp specifically. Any pointers would be appreciated.
 Edit: Some clunky wording in 3rd paragraph.

 As a long-time note-taking enthusiast and writer, I found myself drowning in a sea of information. My Emacs was filled with org files containing highlights, bookmarks, and copied passages, yet I often struggled to recall or effectively use this information when I needed it. I realized I wasn't truly engaging with what I read.
 I stumbled upon Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten method and was intrigued. The idea of summarizing in my own words and connecting ideas across different sources resonated with me. I started experimenting with this method manually and found that I was remembering more and understanding deeper.
 My Solution
 Being an Emacs user, I thought, "Why not create a tool to streamline this process?" That's how I started working on org-zettel-ref-mode.
 Here's what it does:
  
Automatically extracts comments and summaries from the text you're reading.
 Creates an overview window for quick reference.
 Saves literature notes to custom folders.
 Enables quick commenting with a simple command.
 Allows easy navigation between notes and source material.
  
Here's what it looks like:

 I'm curious:
  
Have you ever created tools to enhance your learning process? How did it go?
 How do you manage the balance between efficient reading and deep understanding?
 Do you think automating parts of the note-taking process could be counterproductive to learning?
  
I'd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, or critiques.

 (defun complete-dates ()

 (replace-regexp "\([[:digit:]][[:digit:]]\)" "\1/2024")
 (replace-regexp "YEAR" "2024")

 What that does is replace YEAR with 2024 but not seem to execute the first replacement, or the first replacement fails. 
 What do you think? Do I need more backslashes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, i'm a very newbie guy on elisp and emacs, and i was mixing up into the xml-print function from the emacs sgml-mode. 
 (xml-print '((ul ((class . "bg-red-400")) "Hello")) ) ;; Writes on the cursor: ;; <ul class="bg-red-400">Hello</ul> 
 The thing is, i don't want to insert/write those values, i just want to print(return as string) them. I was looking at the xml.el from the emacs source, and that thing is huge, so even if a replace all the inserts to quotes that might break something. What i did was the following function:
  (defun xml-print-string () (interactive) (let ( (dummy (generate-new-buffer "Dummy Buffer") ) (formated-xml-string "") ) (switch-to-buffer dummy) (xml-print '((ul ((class . "bg-red-400")) "Hello")) ) (setq formated-xml-string (buffer-string)) (kill-buffer dummy) formated-xml-string )) (xml-print-string) 
 Using C-X and C-E it evaluates to:
 <ul class="bg-red-400">Hello</ul> 
 It works...But i don't know if it's the best way to handle this problem. Can this function escale if i use it a lot? (As it's creating and deleting a buffer)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I was playing around a bit with SVG in emacs, and changed the way posframes look like. I also have a semi-working version of the frames being animated (sliding from the side, popping from the middle, etc.) - not shown in the screen capture (wouldn't look good in the gif).
 As you can see, I have it working with vertico (+ Marginilia, etc.), regular posframes (like the LLM summary examples), lsp-doc-ui (and eldoc-box), and for FZF.
 I am wondering if there is enough interest in packaging/cleaning up the code and releasing it as a package.
 Note: for some reason, the gif on reddit cuts off a little of the top of lsp-ui-doc, but in my emacs it works great. Had to degrade the size/quality a bit, it looks much better in real use

 I tried Treemacs but I see that it doesn't work very well with project.el. Like when I start Treemacs for the first time I get a blank sidebar. Yes, I can add a project manually to it using C-c C-p a but it is rather inconvenient to do this for every project I work with. Ideally I'd like something that automatically uses the current Git project as the project tree automatically (like how project.el detects current project from .git folders).
 Is there any package that does something like this? If not, a plain tree-format directory tree browser would also be okay for me. Let me know if you have some recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been getting more use out of Org and Agenda now that I have some nice little capture templates setup and a file that it gets stuffed into. However I've now run across something kind of weird.
 I had two meetings yesterday that I had scheduled and they did show up in the Agenda day view, however now they're showing up again today with the marker "1x". However I did not mark them as repeating. 
 So for instance I have:
 * Appointments ** NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium SCHEDULED: <2024-08-19 Mon 08:30>--<2024-08-19 Mon 13:00> ** Appt w/ Optometrist SCHEDULED: <2024-09-05 Thu 8:00>--<2024-09-05 Thu 9:00> ** 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael SCHEDULED: <2024-08-19 Tue 14:00 +7d> 
 Both the NAO and 1-on-1 meeting were yesterday. Today I'm seeing in agenda:
 Week-agenda (W34): Monday 19 August 2024 W34 notes: 8:30 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium notes: 8:30-13:00 NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium notes: 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael notes: 16:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: DONE Enroll in Benefits Tuesday 20 August 2024 notes: Sched. 1x: NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium <------ These two seem notes: Sched. 1x: 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael <------ weird 
 Why is it showing up again? As far as I can tell from the Org docs and the Agenda docs, I created the timestamp correctly. In the first instance I put in a duration (it was a long block of time) and the second does repeat, but once a week. 
 If I start to accumulate a lot of old entries this is going to get really problematic after a week or two. Any ideas on what I did wrong?
 SOLVED: Took a bit to actually get the RIGHT search engine terms because most things were just pointing back to Org Agenda docs. However the FAQ at this location (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#scheduled-vs-deadline-vs-timestamp) seems to have answered it. I just want a timestamp, not a scheduled for most things I think.

 (global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") (lambda () (interactive) (my/refresh-all-file-buffers) (let ((project-directory (locate-dominating-file default-directory my/buildfile))) (when project-directory (with-temp-buffer (cd project-directory) (let ((elapsed (benchmark-elapse (compile (concat "python " my/buildfile))))) (read-only-mode -1) (insert (format "%.6f seconds" elapsed)) (read-only-mode 1))))))) 
 However, the "%.6f seconds" text does not appear in the buffer. Instead, I get the following message:
 Compilation finished Refreshed open files. 
 I am not sure what the issue is or if the above approach is even correct. Any help in how to get that format text to appear at the end of the buffer?
 EDIT:
 Fixed thanks to /u/arthurno1. Following is the final code, for future reference. I had to save the start time in a variable because the compile function works asynchronously.
 (defvar *last-compile-start-time*) (global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") (lambda () (interactive) (setq *last-compile-start-time* (float-time)) (my/refresh-all-file-buffers) (let ((project-directory (locate-dominating-file default-directory my/buildfile))) (when project-directory (with-temp-buffer (cd project-directory) (compile (concat "python " my/buildfile))))))) (defun my/compilation-finish-function (buffer desc) (with-current-buffer "*compilation*" (save-excursion (let ((inhibit-read-only t)) (goto-char (point-max)) (insert (format "Compilation took %f seconds" (- (float-time) *last-compile-start-time*))))))) (add-hook 'compilation-finish-functions 'my/compilation-finish-function)

 https://preview.redd.it/eoglirodjsjd1.jpg?width=1153&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21c8be6b94e28f655e6f2f6faf08ad6be21acfc6
 I also installed treesit-auto just to be sure but it's still the same. How can I get the proper syntax highlighting?
 Edit: More details about the issue:
 My emacs version is 29.4 and tree-sitter version is 0.22.6_1*, both are installed from official voidlinux repository.*
 Following is my \Messages* buffer when I open c++ file:*
 [yas] Prepared just-in-time loading of snippets (but no snippets found). Starting Emacs daemon. Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1) signaled (treesit-query-error "Node type error at" 216 "[\"_Atomic\" \"break\" \"case\" \"const\" \"continue\" \"default\" \"do\" \"else\" \"enum\" \"extern\" \"for\" \"goto\" \"if\" \"inline\" \"register\" \"restrict\" \"return\" \"sizeof\" \"static\" \"struct\" \"switch\" \"typedef\" \"union\" \"volatile\" \"while\" \"and\" \"and_eq\" \"bitand\" \"bitor\" \"catch\" \"class\" \"co_await\" \"co_return\" \"co_yield\" \"compl\" \"concept\" \"consteval\" \"constexpr\" \"constinit\" \"decltype\" \"delete\" \"explicit\" \"final\" \"friend\" \"mutable\" \"namespace\" \"new\" \"noexcept\" \"not\" \"not_eq\" \"operator\" \"or\" \"or_eq\" \"override\" \"private\" \"protected\" \"public\" \"requires\" \"template\" \"throw\" \"try\" \"typename\" \"using\" \"virtual\" \"xor\" \"xor_eq\"] ce (auto) ce (this) ce" "Debug the query with `treesit-query-validate'") 
 After making this post I tried several different older versions of the tree-sitter-cpp language but it didn't work.
 
 Solution: I installed tree-sitter-cpp grammar version v0.21.0 after reading it in the comments and it worked. Seems I was using wrong versions so far.

 Basically, long story short, Im using Emacs at work and home (for some obscure language called Magik). At work, the laptop install checkpoint as per company policy. Recently, some recent changes, have me struggling with Emacs Python Mode. Im not interested in using Python in Emacs (in PyCharm is fine). But If I turn on python-mode, or insert a python code block into my org files. The software quits Emacs. I want it to enable it minimally, if thats possible, without triggering.

 the code relies heavily on the python program, and it's the python program that does all the heavy lifting.
 I want to make it easy for people to install and use my package. How do I install all the python dependencies and make sure they're available inside of a MELPA recipe?
 i.e. can i do something like:
 pip install numpy
 inside of my MELPA package definition? is there documentation for this? I wasn't able to find instructions for it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://i.redd.it/orel6px49mjd1.gif
 This is a "working" but still highly experimental transient for ffmpeg I've begun work on. It's currently capable of very basic conversion semantics on 1 infile and 1 outfile per interaction.
 Improvements I hope to complete:
  
Multiple infiles and outfiles per conversion; I won't consider the project complete without this
 Stream selection options on the basic conversion options
 Dedicated transient prefix for A/V filter construction and other complex directives
 Support for most of the available infile/outfile commands
  
Many of these improvements (especially the first one) require more thought than went into the prototype, so I expect progress be slow. Transients are a deep but rewarding rabbit-hole to enter. In the meantime, I don't consider the code fit for public consumption; I look forward to this changing in the future.

 Now, just checking before reinventing the wheel... I need a function that updates the content of the file/buffer with any changes that have occurred in the directory. It doesn't need to be immediate, it's fine if it does so when called, and it should just notify me which files have been renamed, deleted, or changed names (using the ID of each referenced file).
 Is there any package that already implements this kind of functions / commands?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is an API out of my control, so I've written a few tests for it in a ZIO test suite to make sure it works as intended.
 I want to ignore these tests if the API server is down, so I've also written a ZIO effect that checks for connectivity. It was like this:
 object ApiTests extends ZIOSpecDefault { override def spec = suite("test api")( ... // tests ).whenZIO(checkConnectivity) .provideShared(ZLayer.fromZIO(ApiService.create)) private def checkConnectivity: ZIO[ApiService, Nothing, Boolean] = ... } 
 But checkConnectivity takes time to run especially if the server is down, so I want to run it only once, whereas with whenZIO on the test suite it's run once for every test in the suite. So at the moment the best I've got is this:
 import zio.test.TestAspect.beforeAll object ApiTests extends ZIOSpecDefault { override def spec = { suite("test api")( ... // tests ).whenZIO(isAlive) @@ beforeAll(checkConnectivityV2) }.provideShared(ZLayer.fromZIO(ApiService.create)) private var isAlive = true private def checkConnectivityV2: ZIO[ApiService, Nothing, Unit] = { ... // overwrites `isAlive` accordingly } } 
 I can't help but feel it's not the best practice to use a loose var here. Is there a more idiomatic way to achieve this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got into functional programming a few years back and was then introduced to category theory, specifically Bartosz's book and video series (link). I read it during my spare time for a span of around 2 years and just finished the last page. Despite having little math background other than the few math classes that are typical for a computer science major, and not being able to come up with many relevant examples, I enjoyed reading through the book and tried my best to follow along every part, except coends.
 However, I struggled with the challenges in the book. I had to look up for solutions, or just failed to understand them at all, for more than half of them. I also didn't realize until the last few chapters that I kind of got natural transformations wrong. I thought it's a morphism of F a -> G a, but really it maps any object a to a morphism F a -> G a. I noticed that my retention for the knowledge is low. In other words, I forget the details of concepts in the book pretty fast. I tried to explain to myself verbally the concepts I learned, but I can feel it's wonky sometimes.
 I'd like to ask what are the next steps for me? Should I go through a different text, maybe "Category Theory for the Working Mathematicians", or others like "Category Theory in Contexts", hoping that maybe they'll solidify and expand my learning from a different aspect? Or should I learn a few other branches of math that I'm interested, and come back to category theory and see how they relate? Or?

 I'm looking to create a custom agenda command that filters all entries associated with the categories work and business. I already have separate files named ~/org/work.org and ~/org/business.org, and from what I understand from documentation, entries in these files automatically and implicitly receive the corresponding categories.
 However, while I don't often do this, it's possible that I might explicitly set a :CATEGORY: work property somewhere else in my org files. Given this, I need a command that will capture all entries either from the ~/org/work.org and ~/org/business.org files OR with :CATEGORY: work, OR :CATEGORY: business set explicitly.
 Below I will give examples of records that I would like to filter in this way:

 I've a project that contains several subdirectories, one of which is shown as foo. The build.sc is as follows:
 import mill._, scalalib._, scalafmt._ trait MyModule extends SbtModule with ScalafmtModule { def scalaVersion = "3.4.2" def scalacOptions: T[Seq[String]] = Seq( "-encoding", "UTF-8", "-feature", "-Werror", "-explain", "-deprecation", "-unchecked", "-Wunused:all", "-rewrite", "-indent", "-source", "future", ) trait MyTestModule extends SbtTests with TestModule.ScalaTest { def scalatestVersion = "3.2.19" def scalacOptions: T[Seq[String]] = Seq("-encoding", "UTF-8") def ivyDeps = Agg( ivy"org.scalactic::scalactic:$scalatestVersion", ivy"org.scalatest::scalatest:$scalatestVersion", ) } } object foo extends MyModule { object test extends MyTestModule } 
 Questions:
  
I want to apply the scalacOptions to only the main source, not test. Currently I achieve this by overriding the scalacOptions in the MyTestModule, but it'd be nice to be able to specify the target specifically instead of declaring globally and then overriding.
 Instead of having to list each submodule foo, bar, ..., it'd be nice to be able to add them dynamically. For this project, all subdirectories that don't start with a period can be considered as a submodule.

 Then I encountered one little problem; it seems that with Emasc 29, I'm no longer able to run Emacs on MSys2 with:
 # not really working well $ emacs-29 -nw 
 whilst with v27.2, I can:
 # working okay $ /usr/bin/emacs -nw 
 The problem doesn't disappear in either the one provided by the package manager or the fresh local Emacs that I built from scratch in MSys2.
 Yes, I know that a workaround would be to use something like:
 # possible workaround with poor user experience $ winpty emacs -nw 
 This is weird though. How does the older package (v27.2) not require winpty, but does the new one (v29 above) now?

 I'm a very inexperienced programmer, and I'm planning on buying a surface pro 11. I have haskell in my upcoming classes, but I've heard people saying it's more complicated since its a windows arm based system. I've programmed a little haskell on my home pc (not ARM based) and the downloading process was fairly straightforward. So I'm wondering whether it's possible to program haskell on a new surface pro without jumping through a lot of hoops, or if it's close to the experience on a PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've two small snippets, where I'm trying to expand one snippet inside another. As the snippet that gets expanded is always the same one, and it's always expanded I've been trying to use yas-expand-snippet and yas-lookup-snippet in a transform on the field...
 My first snippet is something like,
 # key: CMakeVersion # name: CMakeVersion # type: snippet # -- ${1:Major}.${2:Minor}${3:.${4:Patch}${5:.${6:Tweak}}}$0 
 While the second snippet, that I want to expand the first into is,
 # key: cmake_minimum_required # name: cmake_minimum_required # type: snippet # -- cmake_minimum_required(VERSION ${1:Minimum$(yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet 'CMakeVersion))}${2:...${3:PolicyMax}}${4: FATAL_ERROR})$0 
 The transform seems to replace the $1 field with just a t (maybe like this?) and I'm not sure I follow why this is happening? I've tried with and without yas-triggers-in-field in the snippets and my config, but I'm unable to get it to play...
 Am I going about this the wrong way? Is there a better approach? Or can someone spot my mistake?!?
 Thanks, IGS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an enterprise CRUD appliaction, consisting of multiple services such as equipment, tasks, clients, eployees etc. They're not microservices at all, but rather modules within the mononlith Scala app.
 At first every service had its own algebra, e.g.:
  trait Employees[F[_]]: def addEmployee(person: Person): F[Unit] def vacation(employeeId: UUID): F[Unit] def findByDepartment(departmentId: UUID): F[Option[Employee]] 
 Basically a DAO. Sometimes it also does some authorization checks, but mostly its about communicating with the storage. It was cool at first:
  
Different implementations for different storage targets
 I see dependencies of every function e.g. def findEquipment[F[_]: Equipment: Employees]
 Additional type-safety - it's nice to see that a particular function works with Employees only
 Testing
  
However, after some time:
  
We've picked a single storage target
 There's no big difference in terms of dependencies with def findEquipment(equipment: Equipment[IO], employees: Employees[IO])
 Type-safety is a win in 10-20% of functions because many have 4+ algebras or even Async
 For testing I just use the same implementations with empty DB - DB is an important aspect of behavior that I need to carefully duplicate for each testing implementation
  
Tagless Final is advertised for DAO in almost every tutorial, but does it really make any sense? I switched to more concrete services and hardly going to regret. I still have TF, but for much lower-level things: Logging, Tracing, Queing etc. What is your experience? To me it looks like TF make sense in DAO only in educational materials.

I know there are a bunch of ways to install emacs on Mac. I'd like to choose something fairly simple if possible.

 class Wrapper t where wrap :: a -> t a unwrap :: t a -> a 
 Now, of course, I could write:
 newtype Box a = Box a instance Wrapper Box where wrap = Box unwrap (Box x) = x 
 But I'm wondering if it's possible to provide a way for Wrapper to become stock-derivable so that I can write the more concise newtype Box a = Box a deriving Wrapper. 
 I've tried searching for info on this, but I've only been able to find information about, just, how to use deriving in general.

They are actually buffer-local variables, but since I spend most of my time in narrowed org buffers, I decided to hook the modification of the local variables to the narrowing and widening of the buffer. I'm sure it has a lot of room for improvement, but so far it has worked well for me.
 The function hack-local-variables-property-drawer is the one to run when an org buffer is interactively narrowed or widened. Why interactively: you don't want it to run 50 times in a row when calling org-agenda, for example. If it's not the first time it runs in a buffer, it first restores the original values of the variables it changed last time. Then it reads the new variables from the "LOCAL_VARIA…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted about the crashing of Emacs by xwidget-webkit-browse-url here.
 Traversing through threads on Emacs bugs, I found this chain that describes how one can avoid a crash. Namely, run
 emacs -q --xrm "emacs.synchronous: true" 
 (it has to be -q rather than -Q, as the latter ignores all X resources).
 This is fine for one-off uses of the xwidget-webkit browser, but I use Emacs in daemon mode, and
 emacs --init-directory=~/my-init-dir --daemon --xrm "emacs.synchronous: true" 
 continues to crash (I specify the init-directory as I have it in a different location, the problem arises even without it).
 Has anyone found a way around this yet? FWIW, I'm still using Emacs 29.1, will upgrade soon to 29.4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My team is using notion for shared docs. I tried writing directly on notion but 1. the subpage system is driving me crazy (a page can be a link, or can be a whole line! and if you delete the whole line one, the page will be deleted, and sometimes you don't need whole line one; let alone the subpage being attached to parent so moving things around is another hassle) 2. It looks ugly compared to my emacs theme or website theme. 
 The pain plus the bliss of writting in org-mode made me wonder if there's a way to write in org-mode and export it to notion. I guess if I have the bulk of the doc done at some permanent form(don't need to edit much) I don't care where it is on anyway. So what I'm looking for is a solution to 1. write a lot of stuffs in org-mode(possibly from lots of files linked together with org-id or file link) 2. slide them into notion as a cluster of pages. 
 I'm currently trying notion's builtin import function https://www.notion.so/help/import-data-into-notion So far html is not working(failed with no error message), and I'm trying others, but I wonder if there's others have done this before?
 Currently my solution is to 1. write my stuff with org-mode and publish to my personal website (e.g. https://hermanhel.codeberg.page/braindump-ui/#f351ae9c-c280-4c71-9b12-1b8ba4a4200d this some doc I wrote about using huggingface) 2. make a page on notion and stick link to my website there. But this way other's cannot edit it.

I would prefer it to stay as the org-ql-view-list and open the jumped-to-buffer side-by-side to it, so I can jump to the findings one after the other and view them.
 Now, this works well by running toggle-window-dedicated after the org-ql-view-buffer is made up.
 How can I make this the preferred behavior? Would be great if there were an org-ql-view-after-show-hook I could bind it to, but there seems to be none. Is there another way to program "toggle-window-dedicated should be run every time after I called org-ql-search"?

 I ask this mainly because it seems like there is a good chunk of the Scala community that isn't satisfied with SBT, but the main hurdle to any other competition seems to be the ecosystem of plugins that would be lost, or would require separate maintenance by OSS maintainers. Given that there are now several build tools, SBT, Mill, Bleep, Scala-Cli (sorta), Bazel, Gradle, and Maven, that can be used to compile and build Scala code, maybe there is enough examples to figure out a portable standard?

 I've tried both toc-org and org-make-toc packages, which claim to support GitHub. But something must have changed. 
 Each anchor that GitHub generates for a section header is preceded by the number of that header. So instead of github.com/me/bla.org#introduction it's github.com/me/bla.org#1-introduction. Likewise for a sub-header it would be #12-nameofsubheader instead of just nameofsubheader.
 Neither TOC libraries seem to support this format, and I can't find an easy org-mode function that will give me the proper number for a given section, that can work with the TOC stuff.
 I'm wondering: * Could I be doing something weird in my org-mode file that is making GitHub add the numbers to the anchors? * If not, are there any TOC packages that will generate the proper GitHub links?

So my org document would contain several instances of banana, and clicking on it would take me to the designated occurrence of banana. A few days ago I got something like that to work, but unable to find how to do it for the life of me. It’s like the [[banana]] linking, but that simply refers to a heading, and requires the brackets. I recall having it work without the brackets and all instances of banana turning into links.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to run some code after any arbitrary elispf function finishes.
 The question may seem odd, since elisp is synchronous, but it can call async processes. For instance, it may call a compilation process. The elisp function would then continue as normal without waiting for the compilation buffer to finish.
 I know compilation mode has hooks to handle this, but I need to generalize this, not only for compilation mode.
 What is the use case? I am the author of conner. With it, you can define arbitrary commands that can be ran with arbitrary "runners", such as compilation mode, various built-in terminals, or have the command be interpreted as elisp code.
 I would like to have the option of running hooks after a command finishes, but since the runners are interchangeable, and can be defined by users, I would need a generalized way to achieve this.
 Is it possible to run the function that runs the commands in a separate process, and wait for all child processes to finish or something like that? Although that would most certainly open a separate emacs instance or something, and I would like it to run in the current one.
 Thanks.

 Hi there!
 I recently started learning Haskell to gain a better understanding of functional programming. One of the things that caught my attention was raytracing, which is both fun and interesting.
 Haskell is a truly delightful language. Every time I solve a problem or learn a new approach or concept, using monads in real-life scenarios brings me immense joy. One of the most challenging tasks at the beginning was generating random numbers. I had to do a lot of reading and learning before I could efficiently generate them. The difference between Haskell and other languages is significant, and it takes some time to get used to it.
 I would really appreciate some feedback from experienced Haskellers. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or inefficiently.
 Current result

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, inspired by the post A tutorial quantum interpreter in 150 lines of Lisp I decided to write something similar in Haskell. Is not the best implementation but for me was fun because I had the opportunity to write some Haskell after a long time. So, I decided to post the package (hqcsim) on hackage.
 The package dependencies are hmatrix and random and currently it contains a library and an executable. I plan to maintain the package and write tests.
 A difference between the implementation presented in the article and hqcsim is that in the my implementation the measurement is implicit. In the article, there is a "Measurement" operator, as seen in the syntax definition:
  program := ( instruction* ) instruction := ( GATE matrix qubit+ ) | ( MEASURE ) matrix := a complex matrix #2A( … ) qubit := a non-negative integer 
 In my implementation, there is not MEASURE instruction, that being implicit at the end of the program.

Yes, I know there is probably a "better" option, like Kotlin, but I don't want to use it. TL;DR, at the same time I want to use some of Java frameworks/libraries (including the standard one) and features (annotations, enums, good concurrency, static typing, etc...), I want some of Scala goodies, should I use Scala?
 EDIT (please read): I think i have to add some context here, because maybe some people have understood me wrong... maybe because i didn't explained properly. NO, I do not want to use bad practices from Java, and of course I will use Scala good practices, like I said, I want to use the features, frameworks/libraries and some code ideas, not the entire mindset or bad things from the language. If I wanted to use Java code entirely, I would use Java.

 I have two machines that both have access to a home network drive. On that drive, I've got a folder called Notes and that's got notes.org and a bunch of Denote files. So far so good. 
 On one machine (the laptop) I can launch Emacs and do org-agenda n and it'll pull up the day's schedule and current TODO list. On the desktop machine, if I do the same, it seems to just hang. There are no error messages, just silence. I've had to process kill Emacs a few times now to try different things.
 Any idea what org-agenda is doing that would cause it to hang?
 UPDATE: I went into .emacs.d and deleted everything pertaining to org-mode persistence, history, and things like that. That seems to have solved the issue for now. I guess between the two Emacs sessions, something got out of sync. Wish I knew what though, or how to avoid it in the future.

 So if I want to total all the entries using rectangle command and copy into calc like: C-x * r and then execute calc-vector-sum (or "u +" inside calc), I can't select a rectangle with "$" in it. Otherwise, I get an error like:
 calc-do-grab-rectangle: $’s not allowed in this context
 I understand I could reformat the text so the "$" won't get selected, for example adding spaces between "$" and the amount like this:
 2001-01-04 * (797) City of Austin Assets:Checking:UFCU:Bjorg -$59.62 Expenses:Util/Austin:Electric $23.29 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 4.23 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 5.48 Expenses:Util/Austin:Solid Waste $17.91 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 8.71 
 I can then make sure I select the rectangle without the "$" before using C-x * :
 It'd be nice if I can tell emacs calc to ignore "$", but I'm not that conversant with elisp. As far as I can tell, the "not allowed in this context" error is throwing an exception in calc-aent.el when it's checking something with a defvar "calc-dollar-values"? Is that something I can customize in .emacs or init.el?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! We are hosting a Haskell meetup in Vienna on the 26th of September! The location will be at TU Vienna Treitlstraße 3, Seminarraum DE0110. The room will open at 18:00.
 We plan to have 1-2 short talks starting at 19:00 (topics to be announced). Depending on interest there might also be a short Show & Tell session giving people the opportunity to show off or talk about something they work(ed) on for 5-10 Minutes each.
 There will be time to discuss the presentations with some snacks and non-alcoholic drinks being provided afterwards with an option to acquire beer for a reasonable price.
 The meetup is open ended but we might have to relocate to a nearby bar as a group if it goes very late.. There is no entrance fee or mandatory registration, but to help with planning we ask you to let us know in advance if you plan to attend here https://forms.gle/Paiw6D4QJzTKzcmM6 or per email at haskellvienna.meetup@gmail.com. 
 We especially encourage you to reach out if you would like to participate in the show&tell or to give a full talk so that we can ensure there is enough time for you to present your topic.
 We hope to welcome everyone soon, your organizers: Andreas(Andreas PK), Benny, Chris, fendor, VeryMilkyJoe, Samuel

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see that Emacs has many superfluous key bindings, especially C-f, C-b, C-p, C-n, C-a, C-e, C-d, C-v, M-v, which are for functions with already dedicated keys on the keyboard. The dedicated keys are easily accessible on my custom keyboards, so these default bindings do not benefit me at all, and they occupy convenient places for some more useful functions.
 Is there a keymap for Emacs designed to override these bindings with some functions which are useful and by default less easily accessible?
 A naive idea would be to replace the bindings with whatever I want. But that would not be optimal because that would free some slightly less convenient key combinations which could be taken by some slightly less useful functions, & c., so an optimal result would move many functions from less convenient key combinations to more convenient key combinations. So it would have generally simpler key bindings maybe very different from the default ones. That design requires some serious thought, so reinventing this would be difficult, so I would rather look if someone has already done something like that.

(GHC), in an attempt to speed up compile times.
GHC is renowned for many things, but compilation speed isn’t one of them.
One specific problem exposed in issue #20264 is that in Core,
GHC’s intermediate representation, types are systematically inlined, resulting in large type trees having to be
traversed and transformed along the pipeline.
This blog post aims to explain why this is the case, in which situations it can result in slow compile times and large
memory usage, and what we can do about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My eww is slow with port 443 for all websites.
 I found a previous message here from 5 years ago stating this was a tls 1.3 issue.
  
I don't know how to disable it and my searching hasn't found any realistic ways
 
I don't think it is smart to disable tls 1.3 as that sounds unsecure
 
 My eww settings are vanilla - nothing changed. I can get to https urls via firefox without any delay.
 Thoughts?

 To avoid getting myself into a similar situation again, I intend to release much more frequently going forward. So it is with delight, that I can report, that today I have already released version 0.4.1.
 More information can be found in the release announcement.

 So I find output of `xref` a bit unreadable, esp if a symbol is being referred in multiple files. So, I wanted to specify different color/font attributes for lines that contain name of the file where symbols are defined. 
 I noticed that - file name line although doesn't have a different face, it does have a text-property called `xref-group`. Is there a way to colorize and specify some font attributes(such as bold) based on text-property.

 lisp (equal :sublist (list-classify '() '(1 2 3))) (equal :equal (list-classify '() '())) (equal :superlist (list-classify '(1 2 3) '())) 
 The task is to implement function list-classify that checks whether 2 list are equal or unequal or superlist or sublist (of one other). 
 I'm not asking how to implement it (please don't tell me the solution). Just asking what does : represents. I don't know what it's called, (and more importantly what to search about on internet) where to read only about this part. 
 Currently I'm just lost directionless in the sea of elisp-manual. Don't even know what to search in it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I have been wanting some emacs-like mindmap app for a very long time, and all the while I'm thinking of implementing a lisp myself in a similar way. 
 It just downed on me that as complete emacs is already as a lisp machine it probably just lacks builtin API for a canvas, so I can probably fork the C part, keep only the language core and runtime(and keybinding system, I don't know where it is yet), ditch the text-editor part, add canvas support with qt or something, then build a mindmap API in elisp.
 How doable do you think this is? Will emacs source be too tangled with the text-editor part for such thing, or is there some obviously better way to build a lisp mindmap app?
 ps: for reference, the mindmap app I'm thinking about is one with emacs-like lisp runtime and keybinidng system. That along I think will be enough for most things to be built on top off.

I use elpaca for my package loader/manager. I've run through the migration process, all works OK when I do (use-package no-littering :ensure t) near the top of my init.el. But to really clean up, I want it to handle my eln cache, which I think means I need to load it in my early-init.el so I can call startup-redirect-eln-cache on it. But of course elpaca isn't set up there. If you have a similar config to mine, how do you handle this case?
 Same question for `elpa` and `elpaca`: I'd like those to go into `var/` but there's a chicken-and-egg problem. What do you do?

 Does anyone have suggestions on the best way to set these things up? If I put a TODO in a note, it would be nice to be able to see an agenda view of uncompleted notes and links to where it was generated. I've read through the Agenda section in the Org manual but I'll be honest, it was kind of long on detail and short on practicalities. I think I managed to get it work if I had a single agenda file in the ~/.emacs.d directory but what I'd like is something more comprehensive.
 I know it's sort of a personal thing how people set it up, but I'm kind of starting from scratch on this and some models would be good. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi every, I am reading the book "Thinking with types" and I get confused about implicitly universally quantified. Sorry if this question is silly because English is not my first language.
 In the book, the author says that
 broken :: (a -> b) -> a -> b broken f a = apply where apply :: b apply = f a 
  
This code fails to compile because type variables have no notion of scope. The Haskell Report provides us with no means of referencing type variables outside of the contexts in which they’re declared.
  
Question: Do type variables have no scope or they are scoped within "the contexts in which they’re declared" (type signatures if I am not mistaken).
 My understanding is that type variables in type signature are automatically universally quantified, so
 broken :: (a -> b) -> a -> b 
 is equivalent to
 broken :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b 
 forall a b. introduces a type scope. However, without the ScopedTypeVariables extension, the scope of a and b is the type signature where they are declared, but not the whole definition of broken.
 This quantification is to ensure that a and b in the type signature are consistent, that is, both occurrences of a refer to the same a, and both occurrences of b refer to the same b.
 Question: Is my understanding correct?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see a lot of different systems for numbering cards.
It seems to me that using a three- letter alphabetical code at the beginning would help organize better.
For instance LOG is Logic PHI is Philosophy.
Instead of having arbitrary numbers that have to be remembered, a three-letter code could kind of be like an airport code where it makes it really easy to remember, and of course they would be filed alphabetically and then numerically.
Why not?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago I found out about Open RSS. So far I only use it to get beautifully crafted feeds of YouTube channels and playlists with video descriptions and thumbnails. 
 I could have just used the feeds provided by YouTube instead, only if entries would have thumbnails and video descriptions.
 I could have just used an “intelligent” reader like Feedly. But I don’t like proprietary garbage with integrated AI that just ends up making my life harder. And also it’s not Emacs. 
 I could have just an alternative frontend like Invidious. But playlist feeds don’t have thumbnails and videos, entries obviously link to invidious instances and not to YouTube directly and these public instances are slow. I didn’t have the resources to selfhost my own instance and just wanted a convenient, performant solution. 
 I could have just used Elfeed in conjunction with Elfeed-tube. These packages are actually great, but I’m a Gnus user. 
 For anyone with similar opinions and experiences Open RSS might be very well worth a try. For me it hits a perfect sweet spot. It’s also privacy-friendly and is developed in a transparent fashion. Although the source code is not publicly available, at least as far as I know. But that’s understandable as they’re kept alive by their user’s donations.
 Mark, the developer of Open RSS, is quick to reply if one encounters any issues and already helped me out once.

 1) One

 Is there a way to avoid so?

I think we can do it even simpler. Relying just on Scala's implicit mechanism:
  
for components that are to be wired together, use case classes, so that Scala generates apply method to construct it
 use a helper method, which will call this apply, but fetch the arguments from the implicit context; we can call this method fromContext, more on it later
 have all the components …]]></summary>

 If you evaluate this and try to change it through customize-option, there are a few bits of surprising behavior:
  
When you first open the customize interface, one is checked by default, but the "state" widget says that the variable is edited, and the shown value isn't in effect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have dabbled with org-mode a bit in the past and then kind of stopped using it. In the meantime I switched to Colemak-DHm and an ortho split Miryoku keyboard so I feel like I will be starting from scratch again essentially.
 I am interested in using both org-roam and org-mode and I would like some guidance on how to get started. Besides the general advice, I have some specific questions.
  
Is there a recommended order in which to learn them?
 
Is org-roam just some extra commands on top of org-mode?
 
Do I need to adapt something (i.e. change location of keys) because of Colemak?
 
My use cases include notes for work and learning and I would also like to start keeping a personal diary. Shall these go to separate knowledge bases or in the same?
  
Thanks for all the answers in advance and have a nice day/night (wherever you are in the world :p)

 i wanna open two side by side windows and start two different modes on them on startup. i'm familiar with hooks and opening two windows next to each other, but not sure how to write a function that I can run via cli -f flag that'll open a specific mode in each window. any chance somebody can give me an example function def that I can build on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'd like to experiment with Scala.js but I found it quite cumbersome to install a specific npm package: tonejs. My `Main.scala` file looks as follows:
 @JSExportTopLevel("Main") object Main { def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = { println("Hello, Scala.js!") val Tone = global.require("tone").asInstanceOf[js.Dynamic] val synth = Tone.Synth().toDestination() synth.triggerAttackRelease("C4", "8n") } } 
 And my build.sc:
 import mill._ import mill.api.Result import mill.scalajslib._ import mill.scalajslib.api._ import mill.scalalib._ import mill.scalalib.scalafmt.ScalafmtModule import mill.scalanativelib._ import mill.scalanativelib.api._ object tone extends ScalaJSModule { val platform = "js" def moduleKind = T { ModuleKind.ESModule } def scalaVersion = "3.3.1" def scalaJSVersion = "1.16.0" def ivyDeps = Agg( ivy"org.scala-js::scalajs-dom::2.8.0" ) def npmDeps = T{ Seq( "tone" -> "latest" ) } } 
 However, when runnin `node out/tone/fastOpt.dest/out.js`, the compiler complains with:
 export { $e_Main as Main }; ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export' 
 Am I missing any extra configuration? I kindly appreciate any suggestion.

 An Emacs modular template for early-init.el & init.el as a kick starter to a custom Vanilla Emacs configuration that is optimized for performance and sensible settings.
 Author: James Cherti
 Github: https://github.com/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.d
 This is a base starter kit for vanilla Emacs. It's really just an optimized early-init.el and an init.el that strives for fast startup times and sensible default settings. All the magic that is necessary is included. This is really nice because there's a lot of conflicting information online about the best way to optimize GC, etc. in early-init.el and this project does it for you. I've seen similar settings but I also saw some new stuff I didn't know about. 
 It is designed to keep those two files in git so you can update Minimal-Emacs. Setup additional modules for user customization in pre-early-init.el, post-early-init.el and pre/post for init.el as well. 
 It's up to the user to add to the base. If you start with this kit then proceed to watch System Crafters Emacs from Scratch series, it will get you up and running very quickly. 
 James put a lot of effort into this base starter kit and I am digging it, no cap FR as the whippersnappers are accustomed to proclaiming. ;-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been following along Real World Haskell, and getting the indentation right while following their style is infuriating.
 E.g,
 -- file: ch03/Lending.hs lend amount balance = let reserve = 100 newBalance = balance - amount in if balance < reserve then Nothing else Just newBalance 
 I find myself Pressing "tab" to overshoot the appropriate column, then hitting "backspace" in my editor to delete 4 spaces at a time (too many), then repeatedly smacking "space", overshooting again, deleting 4 spaces again, etc....
 Since the appropriate number of spaces to indent changes expression to expression, are there any editor/plugins/etc. that would allow for "contextual" tab stops, so that "tab" and "backspace" simply add and remove the right amount of spaces relevant to the expression I'm currently editing? I'm currently using vscode with haskell-language-server.
 Or would it be better to simply adopt a style that ignores this problem entirely? I.e., Google leads me to https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide
  
The indentation of a line should not depend on the length of any identifier in preceding lines.

 Whenever I use org-download-screenshot, the grimshot kicks in and I can draw a rectangle to capture the area I want on the screen, but then emacs freezes and there is no image found under the org-download-image-dir. I think it has to do with grimshot and org-download not communicating. Having no image in the directory tells me that org-download takes care of pushing the image to the configured directory but grimshot usually saves to ~/Pictures/screenshots but even there I cannot find the screenshots.

  (use-package python :ensure nil ; in-build! :hook (python-mode . (lambda () (if (not (string-equal (system-name) "quark")) (eglot-ensure))) ) (python-mode . ws-butler-mode) (python-mode . hs-minor-mode) :custom (python-shell-interpreter "python3") )

I totally understand it was probably another name for sequence notes in Zettel, my question is, if I were to do this, and how do I know if the number I give to a note is occupied? He wrote in the book that "There are no “occupied slots,” because there is no prescribed order." but if that's the case, does it mean I can have two note share the same number , say "1.1 apple is edible" and "1.1 Elephant is large mammal"? My current thought on a work around is to put that number after a UID, say yyyyMMddHHmmss and a "-" and after that begin the number sequence.
Not sure If I explain my question properly, wish you all good luck.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm very happy to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.10 and yampa-test 0.14.10.
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa's features.
 This new release introduces a new type of integral that implements the trapezoid integration rule. Simulations executed at low sampling rates can behave in ways that violate expected physical laws (e.g., systems may gain energy over time due to inaccuracies in the calculation of positions and velocities). This new integral behaves in a more stable way in such cases. Thanks to Github users idontgetoutmuch , miguel-negrao and thalerjonatha…]]></summary>

 The Symptoms
  
I open a file in Emacs from a directory with a Git repository
 I press C-x g to open Magit
 I move the point to an unstaged file and press s to stage its changes

 This seems to persist between Emacs versions, and it only happens when I open a vterm shell while using TRAMP in a remote server. If I instead open a vterm shell on my local computer first and then ssh into the remote server, it doesn't have this issue.

I have a few additional computers at home, including a web server. I don't really use org on mobile devices. I want to be able to put my org files on my own server and read them primarily from off-network.
 Currently I'm syncing my org files through OneDrive, which works for the most part. I only rarely use my personal computers for org, but would like to be able to reference them, esp. from the server for automations.
 It occurred to me that this could be done reasonably easily through WebDAV. I'm literate enough to set up the technical stuff myself, but realize I may be overlooking other options. Really, I'm less literate in Emacs/org, so I'd ask the community - is there anything wrong with using a WebDAV mount for org files? In terms of use, security, whatever. Is there some better way to share org files on my home server that can be mounted to a directory in linux?
 (for what it's worth: I cannot use a VPN at work but can use an SSH tunnel)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm using vertico and marginalia in my emacs setup. I was following System Crafters video to set up and configure org-roam. I'm not seeing tags in my results when I search for nodes. For example, I have #+filetags: project in some of my nodes. But I don't see them in the results when I run org-roam-node-find. I'm unable to filter by them.
 I'm not sure if this is related to marginalia or vertico. But here are my configs for both.
 Marginalia config
  (use-package marginalia :after vertico :custom (marginalia-annotators '(marginalia-annotators-heavy marginalia-annotators-light nil)) (marginalia-align 'right) (marginalia-align-offset -5) :init (marginalia-mode)) 
 Vertico config
  (use-package vertico :bind (:map minibuffer-local-map ("<Backspace>" . rr/minibuffer-backward-kill)) :custom (vertico-cycle t) :init (vertico-mode +1) (setq completion-styles '(flex partial-completion) completion-ignore-case t completion-category-defaults nil completion-category-overrides nil)) 
 Also, here's one of my roam nodes:
 :PROPERTIES: :ID: AFD9D19B-00AC-477C-95CE-7F02BA88D527 :END: #+title: Foo #+category: Foo #+filetags: project * Tasks * TODO Test task SCHEDULED: <2024-08-09 Fri> 
 Am I missing any config? Any help would be appreciated.
 EDIT: I had to set the following line while setting up org-roam.
 (setq org-roam-node-display-template (concat "${title:*} " (propertize "${tags:10}" 'face 'org-tag)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a Doom Emacs user. I am trying to hide the habits consistency graph from a custom agenda view.
 I tried a few variations of the following to try to only affect this custom view (works for agenda-groups):
 lisp (agenda "" ( (org-habit-graph-column 0) (+org-habit-min-width 0) (org-agenda-span 'day) (org-agenda-start-day ".") (org-super-agenda-groups nil) )) 
 Then I tried setting some variables globally hoping to suppress it:
 lisp (after! (org org-agenda) (setq! org-habit-graph-column 1 +org-habit-min-width 10 org-habit-preceding-days 1 org-habit-following-days 1 org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today t )) 
 Every time, the graph shows in agenda. When I check the variables while in the agenda view the values are not the ones I set in the config; org-habit-graph-column (which I was the most hopeful about if set below the value of +org-habit-min-width) for example is always set to 99.
 Thanks for your help.

 As  indicated in a comment, however, this approach makes it awkward to separate the DI framework from service definitions. It occurred to me it would be easier to do so with an approach modeled on ZIO's ZLayer. I've provided a POC along with a discussion in a gist:

Here's is a pseudocode version of it:
  class { function("/route")(SourceParamsReads(Reads)) { println("a log here prints successfully") Params => println("no logs here or beyond print successfully") function(Params.session) { id => val source = Params.source val user = ( groupId = Params.groupId userId = Params.userId ) val future = ... future.map {...} } } 
 There's more in the ellipses but hopefully this is enough information. the Params variable has no references anywhere else in the application, just before the arrow and inside it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just discovered a "bug" (it wasn't a bug in magit, but a change in Git itself) in magit when I switched to a newer version of Git. After googling I found out that the problem has already been solved in magit over a year ago. Because I'm updating the Emacs packages once in a month, I was wondering why it is still in my local magit installation.
 The reason is that the release versions on NonGNU Elpa and Melpa Stable are still version 3.3.0, which was released on Oct 4, 2021. Does somebody know the reason why there are no new releases on those archives?
 Yes, I know I could use Melpa Unstable, but I don't want it, because I'm serving a lot of my colleagues with an Emacs configuration and I don't want to use unstable package versions.
 Yes, I know I could ask directly on GitHub, but I don't want to create an account for just one question.

Pandas, numpy, scipy, etc.: all have been very helpful for their explorations. We have been going through an exercise of improving the quality of their code because these algorithms will be used in production systems once they are integrated into our core services: correctness and maintainability are important.
 Ideally, these codebases would be written in Haskell for those reasons (not the topic I'm here to debate), but I don't want to hamstring their ability to explore or build (we have done a lot of research to get to the point where we have things we want to get into production).
 Does anyone have professional experience doing ML / data-science / algorithms engineering in the Haskell ecosystem, and could you tell me what that experience was like? Especially wrt Haskell alternatives to pandas / numpy / various ML libraries / matplotlib.

I’ve done a scrappy demo for an application that allows you to publish your notes and actually build a following and income around them. If anyone has the time could you please take a look and fill out the form? The whole thing will take 5-10m. The link is - https://tally.so/r/3x2Do9
By the way, the video is made for people with no prior experience with note taking apps, so parts of it may be information you already know.
Thanks!]]></summary>

 I am developing the major and minor modes for Gobra, a Go verifier. When annotating a go program with specification, we use //@ or // @, and Gobra parses these lines as logic instead of just comments (we also have the multiline variant but let's keep this as simple as possible).
 I have a minor mode for Go buffers to be able to interact with Gobra and I also want to add syntax highlighting for Gobra's specification language. This means I have to override the default syntactic-face-function to work differently for these special comments.
 What I have is this until now:
 ``` (defconst gobra-comment-regexp-prefixes '("// ?@" "/* ?@"))
 (defun gobra-update-nth (l n i) "Return a copy of the list L with the Nth element updated to I." (append (cl-subseq l 0 n) (list i) (nthcdr (1+ n) l)))…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a bit of a follow-up from this post. I have two related problems, I'm at my wits-end and I was hoping for some advice.
 The problem basically boils down to injecting context into an Aeson FromJSON parser. If I wish to read a file of JSON objects that refer to each other, I would like to be able to replace an identifier reference with the actual object when it is read. For example
  data Region = Region { regionID :: Text , regionName :: Text , regionType :: RegionType , regionParent :: Maybe Region , regionLocale :: Maybe Locale } 
 with data like
  [ { "id": "ES", "name": "Spain", "type": "Country", "locale": "es" }, { "id": "ES-CL", "name": "Castille and León", "type": "Subnational", "parent": "ES" } { "id": "ES-GA", "name": "Galicia", "type": "Subnational", "parent": "ES", "locale": "ga" } ] 
 I have an elaborate system of placeholders and normalisation at the moment to sort out the parent references to "ES" and I was wondering if there was something, a la Jackson, that would handle references naturally.
 I have lots and lots of other examples of this sort of need to reference other items.
 The other aspect of this in injecting this information, hopefully using the ReaderT pattern, into another parser that will use this data. As an example,
  data Location = Location { locationID :: Text , locationName :: Text, , locationRegion :: Region } 
 and 
  [ { "id": "S", "name": "Santiago de Compostella", "region": "ES-GA" } ] 
 where the Galicia data, with all its useful information such as locales and holidays, replaces the "ES-GA" reference.
 I have wasted waaay to much time trying to figure out how to achive this and would appreciate any useful* advice.
 * With the caveat that I do not regard "embed it into code" as "useful". The idea that I can't give users control over their configuration makes my skin crawl.

Abusing Haskell: Executable Blog Posts by Sinan
I post my notes on my blog, Hashnode and dev.to, which require slightly different markdown formats. I have been doing the sane thing to fix formats so far. But it is a rainy Sunday and I am bored, so I decided to make this blog post an executable Haskell program to do the same.

 data eventT1 … data eventT2 … class someClass where … instance someClass eventT1 where … instance someClass eventT2 where … data someData = someData { foo :: int , bar :: [someClass] } main = do let test = someData { foo = 1 , bar = [eventT1, eventT2] } 
 The compiler complains the bar :: [someClass] part in the declaration of someData.

 homodoro is what I came up with, a quite simple TUI program with some timers and an extremely simple task manager, I feel like I probably didn't learn much about Haskell/FP in general while developing this but it was the most joy I ever felt while programming something and I'm quite happy with the result.
 All feedback is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have had an init file which I have been using for a few years now. Most of my custom configs are in an org file which is then tangled using org-babel. Up until today I though what happend was :
  
I start emacs, the init file runs 
 it gets to org-babel-load file (code below)
 init.el is generated from org
 init file gets evaluated
  
However, when I was installing on a new machine today, I noticed than not all of the lisp code from the org file was in the generated init.el. Did something change in the newer versions of emacs? (newest machine is 29.4)
 Or have I just been misunderstanding how it worked all this time?
 (org-babel-load-file
 (expand-file-name "init.org"
 "~/.emacs.d/org")) 
 To resolve the issue I deleted the init.el file and restarted emacs, this time it generated and executed everything. Restarting alone made no difference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have read a few threads about this warning, but no detailled answer about how to deal with it.
 Please, correct me if I am wrong, but I understand it is a change in `org-mode` version 9.7 which throws a warning when the function is used in a non Org buffer. So, chances are that when the warning pops up, it is from an external package that has not conformed yet to that new rule/convention.
 Anyway, I get this warning every time I open the agenda time-grid, tall other built-in or custom views are working fine. This is not a terrible thing, but warnings are designed to be annoying, so I would like to get rid of it.
 Is pinning `org-mode` to a previous version the best way to go ? Any recommendation as to which version I should downgrade to ?
 I am a Doom Emacs user if it is relevant. Thanks in advance for your help.

When scrolling past any inline displayed image, the screen shifts down until the image gets completely out of frame, this sudden snap can be very distracting, especially with larger images, so i am asking for some type of workaround to fix this.
 Google searches only suggested pixel-scrolling options, which i tried and have not worked.
 ChatGPT told me to stop using images altogether lol.
 My version of doom emacs is a fairly new install with not much going on inside the configuration or packaging.

Does anyone actively disagree that Luhmann's "Register" and similar documents in modern zettelkästen would naturally be called indexes in the absence of interference from the German word? If you disagree, what does the English word 'register' mean to you, and in a zettelkasten context, how does it differ from an index? (I'm aware that Luhmann explicitly said his Register wasn't meant to be exhaustive, but in my understanding an index doesn't have to be either.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs makes use of a number of Linux-based command-line utilites, such as ls, grep, diff, and so on. However, recently I've started working for a company who has allowed me to have Emacs on my system, and have installed Ubuntu for Windows Subsystem for Linux on their Windows 10 systems.
 Unfortunately, sudo is not an option for my WSL instance, so there's no way to add any components (including Emacs or any GUI functionality) to my WSL instance, so I can only download the native Windows portable version of Emacs.
 I know that you can use the WSL commands by prefacing them with bash -s, such as bash -s find -name filename.ext. However, I'm not sure where I can specify this to Emacs without going through the source to find all the variables containing the commands I need.
 To make this more complicated, I also make use of Vertico and consult (among the other components).
 Is there a single location where I can notify Emacs to add bash -s to the start of shell commands, or perhaps a list of variables that I can add to my .emacs.d tree?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been researching how to use optimal evaluation to optimize Discrete Program Search and, eventually, I arrived at a simple algorithm that seems to be really effective. Based on the following tests:
 f 1001101110 = 1010100110 f 0100010100 = 1001101001 
 Solving for 'f' (by search), we find:
 xor_xnor (0:0:xs) = 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (0:1:xs) = 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:0:xs) = 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:1:xs) = 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs 
 My best Haskell searcher, using the Omega Monad, takes 47m guesses, or about 2.8s. Meanwhile, the HVM searcher, using SUP Nodes, takes just 1.7m interactions, or about 0.0085s. More interestingly, it takes just 0.03 interactions per guess. This sounds like a huge speedup, so, it is very likely I'm doing something dumb. As such, I'd like to ask for validation.
 I've published the Haskell code (and the full story, for these interested) below. My question is: Am I missing something? Is there some obvious way to optimize this Haskell search without changing the algorithm? Of course, the algorithm is still exponential and not necessarily useful, but I'm specifically interested in determining whether the HVM version is actually faster than what can be done in Haskell.

 I am trying to export the matplotlib graphic to the same directory that the org files lives in:
 #+begin_src python :results graphics file output :file temp_plot_2.png import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) y = np.sin(x) fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.plot(x, y) #+end_src 
 The file is generated as expected, but ends up in the ~ directory.
 I checked the default-directory variable, and it is correctly set to the ~/images directory, where the org file lives, and where I want the graph (image) to go.
 When I use absolute paths in the :file argument (e.g., :file /home/<username>/images/temp_plot_2.png), it works as expected, but I don't want to need to provide the absolute path every time.
 Anyone have any idea what's going on, and why relative paths seem to not be working as expected?
 From the org manual, which seems to be in conflict with what I actually observe, since the directory associated with the current buffer is /home/<username>/images according to the local default-buffer variable, but file output is actually /home/<username>:
  
The ‘dir’ header argument specifies the default directory during code block execution. If it is absent, then the directory associated with the current buffer is used.
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Environment-of-a-Code-Block.html
  
I tried specifying the dir header; didn't work. I tried using M-x cd and navigating manually to the /home/<username>/images directory; didn't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I changed the title from "How do you take notes on claims attributed to secondary sources?" to "How to deal with unverified indirect claims?". @Andy pointed out that I am using the terms "primary source" and "secondary source" incorrectly. The distinction I was trying to make was between direct and indirect claims.
I'm currently working on taking more effective notes using the Zettelkasten method and have encountered a challenge when dealing with claims attributed to secondary sources.
For example, academic articles typically contain numerous references to outside sources. Many of the claims discussed are not original but rather derived from these secondary sources.
My struggle is with how to properly document these secondary claims in my notes when I'm unfamiliar with the sources being referenced. I feel uncomfortable directly citing them. However, these claims are often relevant and interesting, and I want to include them in my Zettelkasten for future reference.
Here are some questions I have:
How do you approach taking notes on claims that are attributed to secondary sources when using the Zettelkasten method?
Do you cite the original source, the secondary source, or both in your notes?
How do you ensure accuracy and avoid misinterpretation when you're not directly familiar with the primary source?
Any strategies for efficiently exploring the primary sources when they seem particularly crucial to your understanding of the topic?
I’d appreciate any advice or strategies that have worked for you when navigating this aspect of academic note-taking. Thanks in advance!]]></summary>

After a bit of trying out different configs I got it working with the OAuth 2.0 setup of my employer. 
 Now I'm trying to actually use it, but I find it somewhat unexpected; perhaps that's because I have used org-gcal for a while and was expecting something similar, i.e. synchronizing of the calendar entries into an org file which can be linked to my org-agenda (and calfw).
 For example, a very frequent occurrence is to schedule meetings with other people (in person). This generally works by everybody looking at their calendar to find a spot in e.g. the next week where all of us are available. Is this possible with Excorporate? To me it seems it's only possible to check the calendar entries for a given day (via M-x calendar, moving to the date, pressing d or e), but not get a list of all the events, or all the events in a week/month. 
 Furthermore, creating events seems to be possible via the API (https://github.com/emacsmirror/excorporate/blob/master/excorporate.info, chapter 6 API Usage), but this functionality is not exposed as an interactive function. Does that mean I have to write my own helper functions here? Has anybody done so already?
 Does anybody have experiences with excorporate for these use cases?

I like this workflow but, since I'm a subpar programmer, I often end up with giant and disorganized scripts which are difficult to navigate. I eventually delete the cruft and refactor but I still end up spending a lot of time in this disorganized state. To improve navigation through the spaghetti, I thought maybe a table of contents could be made from the code-cell headers (i.e. "# %% Imports"). Does something like this already exist? Is there some other quick solution involving, e.g., code folding, bookmarks, imenu, etc.? 
 If there's no easy solution I thought this might be a good excuse to start playing with elisp and try implementing it myself. Any suggestions with respect to how to begin would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm reading <Get Programming with Haskell> book on Manning MEAP website and have difficulties in understanding its chapter 21, titled "Hello World! - introducing IO types". In my opinion, it seems to give wrong information. Below is an example:
 "If main isn't a function, it should follow that neither is putStrLn. ... As you can see, the return type of putStrLn is IO(). Like main, putStrLn is an IO action because it violates our rule that function must return values."
 The author seemed to think "IO ()" isn't a value, which I don't agree with. So I googled and found the following on Haskell wiki https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_Haskell_IO/Actions:
 "PutStrLn takes an argument, but it is not an action. It is a function that takes one argument (a string) and returns an action of type IO (). So putStrLn is not an action, but putStrLn "hello" is."
 So I think the author is completely wrong on that, isn't it? On the other hand, however, I read lots of good reviews on the book on Amazon website. Am I misunderstanding something? Thanks for any confirmation or explanation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy. 
 I'm trying to write a util function to clean up org-agenda items. Specifically, if an agenda item has a SCHEDULED and DEADLINE with matching date+time I would like to remove the SCHEDULED property. Here's what I've come up with but though the messages indicate my logic is fine the changes are not being reflected in org-agenda view nor in the file where an item lives. Perhaps there's some save function I'm not calling to persist the changes?
 (defun local/org-remove-schedule-if-deadline-matches () "Remove SCHEDULED from agenda item if DEADLINE exists and matches." (interactive) (org-map-entries (lambda () (let ((scheduled (org-entry-get nil "SCHEDULED")) (deadline (org-entry-get nil "DEADLINE"))) (when (and deadline scheduled) (let ((scheduled-day (org-time-string-to-absolute scheduled)) (deadline-day (org-time-string-to-absolute deadline))) (when (= scheduled-day deadline-day) (message "removing SCHEDULED from task: \"%s\" in file %s" (org-get-heading t t t t) buffer-file-name) (org-entry-delete nil "SCHEDULED") (save-buffer)))))) nil 'agenda))

 https://gitlab.com/perikov/scala-bundles
 I tried this before ( https://github.com/p-pavel/osgi-scala ) wrapping every jar into a bundle, but I finally gave up.
 Everything is badly broken (split packages is the main problem).
 So I just taken a route on bundling releases ("everything related to org.typelevel/cats/n").
 I also have Karaf features with dependencies. 
 For it lets me to just type `feature:install myApp` and have relevant libraries from cats ecosystem (and also elastic4s and others) just install transparently from maven. 
 and `feature:uninstall` just unloads everything.
 I'm not sure if I have to put all this on maven (maven central requires packaging sources with jars, and my jars are just bundles containing relevant libs).
 Is there any interest on this topic?

Purely dropbox like which means it can sync files even if I open the files or not.
 Pull/merge when I open the file.

 All i ask is rich text, image viewing support, linking to other notes/files, hierarchical notes and optionally a GUI.
 I don't mind steep learning curves nor the specific type of rich text.

 any idea on how to make this work?
 edit: using DOOM emacs, saying for the rule and also to make things clear; i use org-modern outside all the doom packages related to org, nothing more

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Scala 2.13, and play-json, I used the following pattern to serialize/de-serialize between case classes and Json:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} object WelcomeResult { implicit val format = Json.format[WelcomeResult] } case class WelcomeResult(service: String) 
 defining implicit formatin the companion object of the case class, made it easily visible from outside, so the following code worked without even requiring an extra import:
 val welcome = WelcomeResult("test") val json = Json.toJson(welcome) 
 In Scala 3 I saw the type class derivation feature and though I could take advantage of it by a. making the code more compact. b. defining such a default formatting only once in a generic way in the type class.
 This is the implementation I have in mind:
 case class WelcomeResult(service: String) derives JsonFormat
 And then something like this in JsonFormat:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} trait JsonFormat[T] { val format: Format[T] } object JsonFormat { def derived[T](using scala.deriving.Mirror.Of[T]): JsonFormat[T] = { new JsonFormat[T]: override val format: Format[T] = Json.format[T] } } 
 But Json.format[T] fails with some "Instance not found: 'Conversion[T, _ <: Product]'" error. I guess, from other examples that I need a macro to implement the desired behavior, but not sure how.
 Any help appreciated.

So direct-style effects and monad effects can be seen as just two different syntaxes for writing the same thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm untrained in music, but every bit of music theory I learn really increases my enjoyment of it. I wanted to learn to compose a bit, and the traditional method is counterpoint. So I did what any barely musically literate nerd would do: I started to write a program to verify that a counterpoint composition follows the rules when played against a given melody. Frankly it was an uphill battle. But finally, this weekend, I got it working.
 https://github.com/ludflu/counterpointer-report
 The main thing that stymied my earlier efforts was that I didn't understand the nature of musical intervals in a formal way. Every explanation I learned described it as a mathematically naive music student might require, which makes sense if I were trying to play the oboe or whatnot. Or, things would be explained in DSP terms, explaining how overtones work, etc. And that also makes sense, but....
 But what I really needed, was for someone to tell me that musical intervals are calculated using integers mod 12. Which actually makes a ton of sense when you think about how human's perceive relative pitch. Did you know that humans are the only animals we know of that perceive relative pitch? I'm pretty sure I learned that from David Huron's excellent book.
 Eventually I thought to ask someone over in /r/musictheory and things mostly worked out from there since I could use the Haskell modular-arithmetic library for the intervals, and Euterpea for representing notes and playing them via MIDI.
 Finally I had to hack around some broken stuff because Euterpea, though its a marvelous library, is not actively maintained and so needed some work to get it to run with modern Cabal. AND PortMIDI-haskell doesn't agree with Clang on OSX. But I was able to patch all those things locally to get everything running, and I submitted PRs to try and fix them up for everyone else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts!
 I've noticed an interesting behavior difference between fill-paragraph in text-mode and org-fill-paragraph in org-mode, particularly when working with selected regions.
 Here's what I've observed:
  
In text-mode, fill-paragraph respects the selected region and only operates within it.
 In org-mode, org-fill-paragraph doesn't seem to respect the selected region and operates on the entire paragraph.
  
I've created a GIF to illustrate this difference:
 https://i.redd.it/7trbpcthrqgd1.gif
 I initially thought this was a bug and submitted a report, but it was determined not to be one.
 I'd like to open this up for community discussion to get your thoughts and insights.
 In org-mode, the behavior remains the same whether a region is selected or not. When no region is selected, I believe this behavior is appropriate.
 However, the issue arises when a user explicitly selects a region, expecting the fill operation to be limited to that selection.
 I think org-fill-paragraph should respect the selected region, similar to how fill-paragraph works in text-mode.
 What do you think about this behavior?
  
Update: Now that I've reviewed the org-fill-paragraph function documentation again, I understand the current behavior.
  
The REGION argument is non-nil if called interactively; in that
 case, if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active,
 fill each of the elements in the active region, instead of just
 filling the current element."
  
Unlike text-mode's fill-paragraph, org-fill-paragraph is designed to "fill each of the elements in the active region."
 The current behavior seems to be explained by this information.
 Thank you for your opinions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fellow PKM enthusiasts,
I find myself caught in what seems to be a cyclical dilemma in the world of personal knowledge management, and I'm curious if others are experiencing the same.
My journey began with enthusiasm for local-first environments like Obsidian and Logseq. The promise of data ownership and flexibility was alluring. However, as time passed, I found myself gravitating back to cloud-based solutions.
Now, I'm feeling the pull towards local files and Markdown again. It's as if I'm caught in a perpetual swing between the convenience of the cloud and the freedom of local storage.
This pattern has me wondering:
Is this back-and-forth between local-first and cloud-based systems common in the PKM community?
For those who've made multiple switches, what ultimately made you settle on one approach (if you have)?
Are there solutions that effectively bridge this gap, offering the best of both worlds?
How do others manage the trade-offs between sync convenience and data sovereignty?
I'm starting to think this isn't just a fleeting concern, but a fundamental tension in how we approach PKM. The desire for true ownership of our data and the freedom to use multiple tools seems to persist, even after trying various solutions.
Has anyone else found themselves in this PKM pendulum? How have you reconciled these competing needs in your own systems?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, sorry I couldn't find a proper title for what I was looking for. what I want is a way for consult completion candidates to show a certain string when I'm selecting from the minibuffer but when the candidate is selected it should be the original form string.
 for example:
 ;; I have this list of paths that I want to select from (defvar paths '("/dir1/dir2/p1" "dir1/dir2/p2" "/dir1/dir2/p3")) ;; I want to parse those paths to only show the filename ;; in the minibuffer (consult--read (--map (file-name-nondirectory it) paths)) ;; the completion is supposed to be p1, p2, p3 ;; but when when I select I want the original path to be selected ;; for example /dir1/dir2/p1 
 I would do it using a hashmap or alist to map between the candidates and the selection.
 is there an easier way around this without using annotate function or marginalia ??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question is mostly to those of you, who love or enjoy Scala (or not, but still visit this sub) but don't get to use it at work, or use it only for Spark.
 Imagine that you're given a task of creating a mission critical component of your company's product. It would have to be a project deployed to the cloud, scalable, reliable, performant (but not extremely performant - jvm performance is fine). It will have to be maintained for years to come - by you, your team and your successors.
 Whatever you choose, you will have to recruit a team or train your coworkers - let's assume that they are mostly java users, good old spring booters, but they are not against the idea of learning a new language and paradigm.
 Would you choose Scala for such a project if given a choice? Do you feel confident that you'd be able to sell this idea to your manager? Do you believe that with Scala it would be cheaper to maintain or more profitable than with other languages? When would it become profitable - the recruitment / trainings would be more expensive surely, so would benefits of Scala become visible after weeks, months, years of maintaining the product, or never at all?

 I get that everyone has their own opinions about coding, but flinging insults like that? That’s just not right.
 Can we please cut the negative rhetoric and start being more welcoming to EVERYONE, regardless of their skill level or coding style?
 The /r/scala subreddit should be a safe space for every Scala user. Labeling other people's code as "trash" is not okay.
 That comment also fails to meet this community's rules of "decency" and "politeness." I'm very surprised that it received 20 upvotes.
 And can we please make full use of all the tools that reddit puts at our disposal? And let’s not turn a blind eye to this kind of behavior, we need to call it out. We can definitely do better. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, this is a follow up post to this post with an amazing title.
 I am writing this so it doesn't just exist on my laptop and is documented somewhere. Maybe this is common knowledge, I did not find it anywhere.
 Basically, update from my end on the direction Monoidal -> Traversing is that there's a way to write
 monoidalToTraversing :: (Choice p, Monoidal p, Traversable f) => p a b -> p (f a) (f b) 
 we use a variation of Alexis King's construction
 data Traversal a r b = Done b | Yield a !(Traversal a r (r -> b)) deriving Functor instance Applicative (Traversal a r) where pure = Done Done f <*> a = f <$> a Yield a rToTf <*> ta = Yield a ((\ f b x -> f x b) <$> rToTf <*> ta) traversal :: Traversable t => t a -> Traversal a b (t b) traversal = traverse (\ a -> Yield a (Done id)) unTraversal :: (a -> b) -> Traversal a b tb -> tb unTraversal _ (Done tb) = tb unTraversal morph (Yield a fab) = unTraversal morph (fmap ($ morph a) fab) traversalP :: (Choice p, Monoidal p) => p a b -> p (Traversal a b x) (Traversal b b x) traversalP = dimap toEither fromEither . right' . (both <$> id <*> traversalP) where toEither :: Traversal a r b -> Either b (a, Traversal a r (r -> b)) toEither (Done x ) = Left x toEither (Yield a resume) = Right (a, resume) fromEither :: Either b (a, Traversal a r (r -> b)) -> Traversal a r b fromEither (Left x ) = Done x fromEither (Right (a, resume)) = Yield a resume monoidalToTraversing :: (Choice p, Monoidal p, Traversable f) => p a b -> p (f a) (f b) monoidalToTraversing = dimap traversal (unTraversal id) . traversalP 
 (I call both :: p a b -> p c d -> p (a,c) (b,d) to Monoidal's idiomatic class function) the other direction (Traversing -> Monoidal) needs some other kind of ideas which I am not having so far.
 Remaining questions:
  
What about the other direction?
 How to do this for Traversing1? It shouldn't use Choice, because Either a is not a Traversable1
 What are the implications?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two dummy examples, both Scala 2.12. 
 First example - sequence of Foo[t <: T], and I want some function to use that t somehow. Pseudocode-ish:
 ``` type A <: T type B <: T
 trait Foo[t <: T]
 object Foo1 extends Foo[A]
 objet Foo2 extends Foo[B]
 def someFunc[t <: T](foo: Foo[t]): Unit = { somethingThatKnowsHowToTakeTypes[t].foobar }
 Seq( Foo1, Foo2 ).map(someFunc) ```
 This leads to type erasure concerns, even though to me it seems obvious that that Sequence is of a type where each object inside is a Foo of some concrete type that fits the constraints. I can get around it by introducing some wrapper case class that I can stick Foo1 and Foo2 into, which retains it's type as an explicit member. And then inside someFunc I have to manually use that type member explicitly. Feels clunky and it feels like something I'm tricking the compiler into doing. Not to mention at some point I did get it to compile, only to fail at runtime if I didn't create the correct implicit typetag in scope.
 Second example:
 Sequence of (Foo[t <: T], Bar[t <: T]), and Bar/Foo have methods that operate on or return t <: T. I store in a 2-tuple because inside a lambda I want to do something like Foo.read(...).map(Bar.transform) where Foo.read returns something typed by t and Bar.transform takes something subtyped by t. I assume since I pair them up in a 2-tuple, the Seq of these such objects could recognize that it's some paired object, but instead the compiler complains about expected vs supplied types.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs beginner, started with spacemacs. I want to use spacemacs in terminal mode in my remote machine(Ubuntu) by doing ssh from my Mac. 
 How can I enable copy/yank from some text from my Mac browser into emacs buffer on the terminal and also vice versa. 
 I tried clipetty and it works when I yank something from emacs buffer and paste on Mac but not the other way around. Also it does not work at all when using tmux. 
 Appreciate any suggestions!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I need to find the nth prime number. This is what I have so far:
 module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -> Maybe Integer nth n | n < 1 = Nothing | otherwise = Just ([x | x <- [2..n], isPrime x] !! (n-1)) isPrime :: Int -> Bool isPrime 2 = True isPrime n | n < 2 = False |otherwise = all (map (\x -> n `mod` x /= 0)) [2..root] where root = (floor . sqrt . fromIntegral) n 
 Some of the errors I get are (seems that both functions are wrong):
 Couldn't match expected type ‘Integer’ with actual type ‘Int’ • In the expression: x In the first argument of ‘(!!)’, namely ‘[x | x <- [2 .. n], isPrime x]’ In the first argument of ‘Just’, namely ‘([x | x <- [2 .. n], isPrime x] !! (n - 1))’Couldn't match expected type Couldn't match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -> Bool Actual: [Int] -> [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\ x -> n `mod` x /= 0))’Couldn't match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -> Bool Actual: [Int] -> [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\ x -> n `mod` x /= 0))’ 
 The second error is not really clear for me, I thought that all returns Bool (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool), why would it be [Bool]? Also, any hint for the first function? Thank you.
 EDIT:
 Correct solution:
 module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -> Maybe Integer nth n | n < 1 = Nothing | otherwise = Just (toInteger ([x | x <- [2..], isPrime x] !! (n-1))) isPrime :: Int -> Bool isPrime n = null [x | x <- [2..n-1], n `mod` x == 0]

 Both ways, the python:getting command in ubuntu are highlighted with org-document-title face, so I think (I could be wrong) that org-mode parses both way alright(or is it font-lock and parser behave differently?). but the space will make that huge difference to org-roam-find-node
 Why?

 I wonder - is there way to write it as something like
 val fooList:List[String] = forAllTypes( ???[TypeI] => bar[TypeI]()) 
 I have not a clue how the function definition would even look like. It would only save few lines, but it got me fascinated if there is some deeper scala magic I'm not aware of yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My main gripe are
  
I'm not always logged into reddit, and when I click a reddit link, it produces some fake security error, and tells me I'm not logged in or I should use my developer token. I'm not sure why reddit has started to do this, but does it have something to do a desire to monetize it it more, and may even have something to do with AI. It seems reddit has also signed some exclusive deal with Google allowing only Google to index it.
 
The way Reddit know handles blocking by other users. Sometime ago I began to notice that so many responses had some error like deleted and unavailable. Something I remarked on in this thread - Why do some reddit users especially on r/emacs keep messing up threads their involved by deleting their posts or making them unavailable? I don't see why some people should disrupt a technical discussion by blocking some participants who can't see what is going. It is not as though this Twitter or Facebook, this is simply a technical forum and the discussions don't often veer into the political. What kind of mindset does it take to block someone because you don't want them to read your views on technical issues, and it is not as though the person blocked cannot login using another account to see the thread?
 
 These two issues are making this forum less appealing. Perhaps I should use stackexchange more instead.

I run my own little branding & design agency, and when I decided to start writing blog posts I found myself falling down rabbit holes of psychology, Jung, archetypes, consciousness, and on. I realized that I needed a better way to hold on to and integrate all the new ideas I was finding — which led me to a new rabbit hole of Zettelkasten and trying to understand the philosophies and processes behind it.
Many of my web searches would lead me to thoughtful discussions on this forum, so I thought I'd tag along and try to absorb your collective knowledge!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years (I use AoC as way to get familiar with new languages I add to my trophy collection), I've been used to that naive solutions for AoC2015/4 (iterate over numbers, conver to string, concatenate with prefix, hash, convert to hex, check n zero prefix, repeat) take 'too long'.
 The first optimization was to figure out how to pre-hash the prefix (in some languages/libs, copying the state is not as straightforward as calling a method).
 Second was not converting a number to string, but incrementing a byte array (or mutable string) representation of the number.
 The last is to re-use a buffer for the resulting hash, ideally not converted to hex, and to directly check the first few bytes (and perhaps 4 bits) to be zero.
 Usually, all this got me a speed-up of at least 10x.
 What totally shocked me was that the naive implementation finished in less then five seconds (I expected roughly a minute), and that further optimizations got it down only to under three seconds.

 Successfully starts and connects to a local pylsp when editing a local file - but is unsuccessful in starting a remote pylsp when TRAMPing a remote file. Exits with error: (:message "Connection state changed" :change "exited abnormally with code 127\n")
  
 Local machine is windows running putty - TRAMP connection /plink:server:/temp/test.py
 Remote machine is FreeBSD 13.2 running sshd and samba.
 
"Local" editing (and pylsp) via samba share works, but with pylsp running on the local windows machine and test.py on the remote samba share editing is slow and is not optimal.
  
Any suggestions on having option 3. work for both local and remote pylsp?

 I'm trying to compile a cabal project using the ghc-wasm-meta 9.8 compiler, but I'm getting the following error:
 wasm-ld: error: unable to find library -lHSrts-1.0.2_thr 
 my cabal.project and each name.cabal have the following ghc-options:
 program options/library ghc-options: -no-hs-main -optl-mexec-model=reactor "-optl-Wl" 
 something I noticed is that if I run build using --verbose , the call to wasm32-wasi-ghc doesn't have any of the ghc-options I've set. Maybe it's got something to do with the `Setup.hs`? but that file just has the usual:
 import Distribution.Simple main = defaultMain 
 Anybody got an idea of what might be happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 recently I've had some trouble with Doom Emacs crashing unexpectedly and I've been trying to troubleshoot today with research and chatgpt.
 I found on r/DoomEmacs a similar thread where an Arch user was experiencing the same thing while editing C++ files while mine was mostly happening when editing Rust files. I don't have much to go on but my assumption was that when the rust-analyzer was working or Rust LSP was communicating it was causing it to panic and crash but this was just an assumption and I was having trouble getting much out of --debug-init. This user was able to downgrade to version 29.3 and it solved their problems.
 Recently I've completely uninstalled rust, emacs and doom emacs and found wayland-emacs on the aur which I didn't notice last time. I've reinstalled Rust and now I'm going to attempt to install this AUR package and go from there. Another issue I was having was opening Fish shell in Doom Emacs with Term which wasn't an issue before until installing Rust.
 It's also important to note that I've had this Arch + Hyprland install for about 2 weeks and Doom Emacs hasn't given any issues what so ever until installing rust and rust-analyzer but also I upgraded around the same time and I know there was an upgrade 2 days ago. Thanks for reading, I wanted to try and be thorough so I apologize for the length of this.
 P.S The user on Arch I was talking about with a similar issue was using X11
 EDIT: solved, I use the pacaman package manager to uninstall emacs-wayland and installed emacs instead. So far rust hasn't crashed when editing or coding rs files in doom and rust-analayzer is working. Must install with rustup component add rust-analyzer though, not your package manager. and using vterm this time with no issues.. yet ;)

If you don't want to use any plugins and want to solve this directly through vim commands, the method is to first select the text and then enter the command "ay, which copies this text to the a register.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to Scala. I'm writing some performance-sensitive code for processing objects on several axes. My actual code is more complicated and handles more axes, but it's structured like this:
 class Processor: xData: Data yData: Data zData: Data def process(axis: Axis) = axis match case X => doStuff(xData) case Y => doStuff(yData) case Z => doStuff(zData) 
 But it is a bit repetitive, and it's easy to make a typo and use the wrong data object. Ideally, I'd like to write something like this
 class Processor: data: HashMap[Axis, Data] def process(axis: Axis) = doStuff(data(axis)) 
 Unfortunately, this code has different performance and correctness characteristics:
  
It's possible for me to forget to initialize Data for some of the axes. In a language like TypeScript I could type the field as Record<Axis, Data>, which would check at compile time that keys for all axes are initialized. But I'm not sure if it's possible in Scala.
 Accessing the map requires some hashing and dispatching. However fast they may be, my code runs millions of times per second, so I want to avoid this and really get the same performance as accessing the field directly.
  
Is it possible to do something like this in Scala?
 Thanks!

In general, this works great; the exception is org. 
 Any kind of :ensure form doesn't work with installing the latest revision of org (afaik), because the pre-installed version shadows it; use-package uses package-installed-p to decide if a package isn't installed and needs to be downloaded, and since org is always installed, no download will ever trigger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been scratching my head for a while now about how to handle task dependencies in Orgmode.
 First off, I am aware of `org-depend` and `org-edna` as well as the `ORDERED` property. I am trying to find a way to make them work for a common, but specific type of dependency.
 Task Dependencies
 As defined in this [blog page][1] from the 'projectmanager.com' website, a Gantt chart will define 4 types of dependency. I find two of them essential in my task management workflow.
 Finish to finish
 The first one, and most commn I think, is the **finish-to-finish dependency** which is the one I believe is covered by org-mode; this is also the easiest to enforce (again imho) programatically with orgmode tools. Task A cannot be marked as `DONE` before task B and C are.
 It is what `org-enforce-tod…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been diving into the world of algebraic effects systems as an alternative to mtl-style classes for granular effect tracking. One thing I haven't quite figured out yet is how to handle errors in the middle of a computation that uses a custom effect type. For example, let's say I have an effect for talking to the database:
  data DB :: Effect where DBWrite :: Item -> DB m () DBRead :: Key -> DB m (Maybe Item) 
 and types for errors and the database environment
 ``` data DBError = DeadLockError | ConnectionError
 data DBEnv = DBEnv Connection ```
 and let's say I have the interpreter:
  runDBIO :: (IOE :> es, Error DBError :> es) => DBEnv -> Eff (DB : es) a -> Eff es a runDBIO env = interpret \_ -> \case ... do handling here ... 
 Now the recommended way to instrument all of this is to wire up all of your effect handlers at the start of your program:
  main = do env <- getDbEnv result <- runEff . runError @DBError . runDBIO env $ program case result of Left -> ... do something ... Right -> ... do something ... 
 This all makes sense. But what if I want to handle the error at a deeper level in the program and not at the very top level? The Error DBError effect doesn't manifest in the type list until the runDBIO interpreter is applied. For example,
  tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage :: Item -> Eff [Email, DB] () tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage item = do catchError (dbWrite item) $ \_ e -> emailPage $ "Something went wrong: " ++ (show e) return () 
 This doesn't work here because the type signature doesn't contain Error DBError, but the underlying implementation of DB uses it. If I add Error DBError to the effect list, wouldn't that be a totally separate effect from DB, so it wouldn't be able to throw and catch in the same context? Should I manually expose effects for TryDBWrite and TryDBRead that return an Either? Not exactly sure what to do here.

I find it more convenient than the HTML versions.
 This is done by running make pdf.
 However, these PDFs don't have hyperlinks or clickable TOC.
 Only the major manuals released here, like the GNU Emacs Manual, the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual and An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp seem to offer that functionality.
 Any idea how to get it done for all the other manuals?
 EDIT:
 Problem solved. I overlooked that the hyperlinks work fine. They're just not highlighted.

 I have a somewhat weird scenario. I have been invited for a code review interview round with a company that works primarily on scala and a bit on Java. I am a Java resource and have never worked on scala before but they have told me that they are okay to hire people with Java knowledge as they have a pretty decent upskilling plan. However the code review is on a scala code. My question is as a senior Java dev how can I deal with this. I was thinking I will brush up on a few core concepts of functional programming and monads. Anything else you guys suggest. The recruiter said that they ofcourse know that I have never worked on scala so I will be judged accordingly but I am sure there will still be some stuff that I can do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SOLVED: eshell-highlight-prompt being set to nil caused the behavior. Setting to true fixes the issue, which makes me wonder why the setting is used in the repository at all.
 I am excited to start using Eshell after reading about it on Mastering Emacs. Since I wasn't happy with default prompt, I installed the eshell-prompt-extras package like the article recommended. However, if I continue pressing backspace, my prompt and previous shell output can be deleted, which is not the correct behavior.
 I understand eshell-prompt-regexp has to match the prompt and I think it does because C-a takes me to the correct place after the prompt. Since Eshell doesn't use comint-mode, I don't know of a function to make the prompt read-only. Is there any way to achieve the desired behavior?
 My Eshell prompt customization settings are copied and pasted from https://github.com/zwild/eshell-prompt-extras:
 (with-eval-after-load "esh-opt" (autoload 'epe-theme-lambda "eshell-prompt-extras") (setq eshell-highlight-prompt nil eshell-prompt-function 'epe-theme-lambda))

I'm not actually sure how the popularity metric is derived, but I think it's based on users who indicated that they had "done extensive development work in over the past year". Scala is at 2.6% of all respondents, slightly down from 2.77% last year. Among respondents who are professional developers it's 2.9%, down from 3.21% last year. Among those still learning to code it's 1.7%, way up from 0.77% last year.
 If I had to put some flavor on these numbers I'd say Scala is still at the top of the long tail of languages. It comes in about 20th among programming languages (ie. I ignored SQL, HTML, bash, etc.) so certainly still relevant. Movement from last year is negligible except for new developers, which is very cool.

Before I read a new book, I'm interested in how it relates to the books I've read so far. To get an initial overview, I simply create a new Reference Note for the book in my Zettelkasten. It consists of a brief description of the book and a few references to existing notes.
When I quickly look through the bibliography, I find these references. They are links to books that I have already read or to books that are on my reading list. These are simply added to link the Reference Note. The graphical overview is generated automatically by the Zettelkasten tool.

The resulting literature map helps to provide an initial overview. By adding a few details, the map becomes somewhat easier to read as a concept map.

The concept map will be refined further. Quotations and ideas from the existing 'Reference Notes' make the 'Bibliographic Map' easier to read. It now offers a good overview that facilitates the overall understanding of this bibliographic network.

 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/htmx
 This is roughly based on `lucid-htmx`, but is different enough that I think it can be considered stand alone and not a fork. Notable differences:
  
Not using the old `data` based tags
 New type-safe interfaces for various htmx enumerations
 Module structure tries to follow some htmx concepts (like core and extra attributes)
 Significant documentation
 Additional attributes that didn't exist in `lucid-htmx`
  
I am going to try and stay active on the issue tracker, and keep this package up to date with new GHC indexes. Hope this is useful to some of you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my notes collection I use org-publish to create a nice personal website out of org-roam files. I have an index file that programmatically lists posts in categories, with tags, or in alphabetical indices. I do this via macros that expand into dynamic blocks and run all dynamic blocks during export via a source block near the bottom of the page.
 It's slow. Real slow. I do all the post link lookups using org-roam, so I assume that's just sqlite db queries. Then I use very minimal org syntax to turn it into links.
 I realised recently that I could probably do the same thing via exported source code block results, since I only need all this stuff during export.
 Is there a noticeable performance difference between org-babel exporting the results of some Lisp code, and that same Lisp code being used via dynamic blocks?

How does scala fare in that department?
 Thanks in advance for your response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given a frame with various windows in it, I want to be able to write text into them without them being associated with a file, and I don't want to spam buffers into the buffer list. I was thinking that having a single "log buffer" into which the messages would be written would prevent buffer spamming, and then I could just show the operator a different particular message in each window. Playing around with different things, trying to use indirect buffers with some sort of region narrowing seemed to be a good possible option.
 I didn't have much luck with this though:
  (let ((org-dates (list "2020-04-05" "2023-08-02" "2021-09-08" "2019-08-04"))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (balance-windows) (dolist (earlier-journal-entry org-dates) (pop-to-buffer (make-indirect-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Org Roam Daily Reflection Log*") (generate-new-buffer-name "*indirect*"))) (let* ((start (point)) (org-msg (concat "\n\n* No daily journal entry for " earlier-journal-entry "."))) (insert org-msg) ;; (org-mode) (narrow-to-region start (point))))) 
 In particular, the narrowing doesn't seem to work right. How should I be doing narrowing?
 (If this is at all the right sort of approach to this task.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me again! after removing some libraries, my project now depends on:
  
containers
 mtl
 transformers
 singletons
 singletons-base
 parsec
  
Nevertheless, since I'm using ghc-wasm-meta, I cannot really include the singletons-base package (since it depends on th-orphans and the WASM backend doesn't support TH yet).
 I might be able to patch things up, if I can just expand the TH definitions in the singletons-base package, but I don't really know how to do this without just forking the repo, running cabal build with -ddump-splices -ddump-to-file flags, and manually deleting the _XXXX identifiers.
 Is there a better way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have tried doing
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode t)
 (setq-default tab-width 4)
 (defvaralias 'c-basic-offset 'tab-width)
 (setq ruby-indent-tabs-mode t)
 (defvaralias 'ruby-indent-level 'tab-width)
 (defvaralias 'sgml-basic-offset 'tab-width)
 But it doesn't work. This leads to tabs just being composed of 4 spaces, not one tab. Similar to the neovim editor, I want tabs to be just tabs. One large block, instead of being packed with several tiny spaces. I need this for indentation. Relying on tabs to be just full of spaces is impossible for me. Can anyone help. I have tried several solutions, but they all are just solutions which means tabs will be filled with 'x' no of spaces. not tabs with TABS. I am new to Emacs, and I have heard this whole tab business is not very straightforward. So please do explain if I got something wrong
 EDIT - I got the solution from this kind soul on stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6471803/making-emacs-tabs-behave-exactly-like-vims
 (eval-after-load "cc-mode" '(define-key c-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'self-insert-command)) (global-set-key (kbd "DEL") 'backward-delete-char) (setq c-backspace-function 'backward-delete-char) 
 This treats tabs as one large tab. You can have the same control as neovim. It also deletes the entire tabs via the single backspace. I am not sure if this is gonna work with javascript. But I hope this post will help others
 This is all I have put in my init.el file related to tabs
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode t) (setq-default tab-width 4) (defvaralias 'c-basic-offset 'tab-width) (setq ruby-indent-tabs-mode t) (defvaralias 'ruby-indent-level 'tab-width) (defvaralias 'sgml-basic-offset 'tab-width) (eval-after-load "cc-mode" '(define-key c-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'self-insert-command)) (global-set-key (kbd "DEL") 'backward-delete-char) (setq c-backspace-function 'backward-delete-char)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I am trying to make use of the "wuss" secure websockets library, at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wuss. This adds TLS to the underlying websockets library.
 I can build and install the library fine with GHC 9.8.2, and the sample client at https://github.com/tfausak/wuss also builds fine. However, when I go to run it, it fails as follows:
 dyld[44192]: missing symbol called
 In this case, 44192 is just the PID. I tried using otool to see if there is a missing dynamic library, but I believe this shows that there is no missing library as such. Most likely, the "missing symbol" means that the library that is used, doesn't have something that is called. However, the error doesn't specify the issue there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Haskellers
 I've been struggling with a strictness/laziness issue in a recursive mini-language I've been trying to define. I'll present a pruned version here to narrow the code to the focus of my issue. 
 I can encode my problem with 5 combinators:
 haskell data Recur t a = Val a -- ^ A stored value | Hop t -- ^ A jump-to-binding statement | Seq [Recur t a] -- ^ A sequence of 'Recur' statements | Opt [Recur t a] -- ^ A choice of 'Recur' statements | Bnd t (Recur t a) (Recur t a) -- ^ An introduce-binding statement deriving Eq makeBaseFunctor ''Recur 
 Then I can define recursive sequences like this:
 ```haskell type R = Recur Text Int
 x12, x34 :: R x12 = Seq [Val 1, Val 2] x34 = Seq [Val 3, Val 4]
 n1, n2, n3 :: R n1 = Opt [x12, x34] n2 = Seq [n1, n1] n3 = Bnd "x" n1 (Seq [Hop "x", H…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen some pretty and complex large code bases written in C++ for image manipulation and color space conversions and to the untrained eye they look like having a set of unrelated bunch of source code with same functionality spread between different files, but usually it makes sense due to the chosen of a complex architecture fitting to critical processing and low level access. It can take months to understand what its being done and the process usually feels like trying to take some random file reading it, trying to look its dependencies back and forth until you finally make some sense out of those. Could this process be eased if every file was accompanied by some org file? And could a master org file tell "Hey this is how you should begin reading the source code"

 Let's say, will it be possible to do the same with another interpreter? Something like a Lua interpreter and build everything on top of it with pure Lua or a Java's JVM and build something on top? Was this tried before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for project ideas for a final assignment in a college course using a functional language. We primarily used Haskell, but we're open to other functional languages if the project is interesting.
 The project should take around two weeks for two advanced software engineering students, so it should have some complexity (but not too much). Preferably it should use a monadic strategy to solve a problem.
 I've already built a compiler in a previous course, so I'd prefer not to go that route again. I was considering creating a SAT solver, but one of our teachers mentioned it involves a lot of state management, so I'm unsure if it's the best fit.
 Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have quite a few projects and meeting and i keep track of them by using columnview dynamic block to show them in the project (each meeting has a property which points to the project and :match searches for the property). Columview has an option to add Links (so i just need to click on it and see what has been discussed). But this link feature doesnt work if the item are in a different file. 
 So when capturing a meeting with org-capture i just created another property like:
 :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\1][%\1]]
 which is essentially a link to itself, where %\1 is the Meeting Title and the org headline and add this Property to the columnview. That way i can click on it form a project and see what the meeting was about.
 Now the Problem: the headline might not be unique (e.g. weekly repeating meeting) and there for i thought it might be a better idea to use a custom_id for example. So i tried to use a capture template like this:
 * %^{Meeting}
 :PROPERTIES:
 :PROJECT:
 :ATTENDEE:
 :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\1][%\1]
 :CUSTOM_ID: %<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-%(string-replace " " "-" "%\\1")
 :LINK2: [[id:%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-%(replace-regexp-in-string "\s" "-" "%\\1")][%\1]]
 :ID: %(org-id-new)
 :END:
 I try to replace the whitespace in the headline as this would be no valid ID. But that doesnt work it gets evaluated but the whitespaces are not replaced. i could reuse :ID: aswell but dont know how in a capture template. Ideas??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on a project, and I've recently hit a devops-ish kind of issue: after getting ghc-wasm through nix flakes, I'm trying to compile the project by: wasm32-wasi-cabal build WASM --flags="wasm", but I get errors building happy and th-orphans.
 happy error:
  Configuring executable 'happy' for happy-1.20.1.1... Preprocessing executable 'happy' for happy-1.20.1.1... Building executable 'happy' for happy-1.20.1.1... wasm32-wasi-ghc-9.6.4: could not execute: /nix/store/70jynsvi21a9lm46n82yvvqfh15fdlra-wasm32-wasi-ghc-9.6/lib/wasm32-wasi-ghc-9.6.4/lib/bin/unlit 
 th-orphans error:
 ``` Configuring library for th-orphans-0.13.14... Preprocessing library for th-orphans-0.13.14... Building library for th-orphans-0.13.14... [1 of 2] Compiling Language.Haskell.TH.Instances.Internal ( src/Language/Haskell/TH/Instances/Internal.hs, dist/build/Language/Haskell/TH/Instances/Internal.o ) [2 of 2] Compiling Language.Haskell.TH.Instances ( src/Language/Haskell/TH/Instances.hs, dist/build/Language/Haskell/TH/Instances.o )
 <no location info>: error: Couldn't find a target code interpreter. Try with -fexternal-interpreter ```
 Regarding the happy error, although there is no unlit executable in that folder, there is one called wasm32-wasi-unlit, so I believe some sort of symlink can solve this, but I have no idea on how to include this in the flakes.nix file.
 Regarding the th-orphans error, I'm totally clueless.
 P.D: don't mind too much about stack in the flakes, it's there because I wanted to make sure that the other executable compiles normally.

 I have a very long list, with many subnested lists (think of it as a tree), and as of now it's currently 6000 ish elements.
 before you say why such a big list it's stuff I want to buy, it's a way to autocontrol..
 whenever I C-c C-c on anything, that be a checkbox or a counting box (the [/], idk the proper name), it takes a lot, like a good two minutes at least.
 i tried to profiling, and it seems taht org-element--list-struct in memory section is the biggest one, with match-data in cpu, but the latter it's only a 6%. I can post the full profiling if it can help, but from my (poor) understanding of the profiling reoprt, these two are what takes longer. is there a way i can improve the performance? or do I have to split it down into smaller lists? i have such giant single list because I like to have at the top two boxes that one is the percentage and the other one is the counting one. if there is a way to divide the list into the various categories, maybe with *s, while keeping an overall "completion" on the top, that would solve the issue.
 tl;dr i have a giant list. can i improve the performance? I just chronometered it, and it clocked it at around five minutes. or, if I break it down to more smaller lists, is there a way I can keep track of the overall progress?

Changes since v2.15.7:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack uses the version of the Cabal package that comes with the specified version of GHC. Stack no longer supports such Cabal versions before 2.2, which came with versions of GHC before 8.4. Consequently, the init command will not try LTS Haskell before 12.0.
 The init command initialises stack.yaml with a snapshot key rather than a resolver key.
 After installing GHC or another tool, Stack deletes the archive file which provided the tool.

 I am struggling to find the relevant documentation to get emacs to work with debugpy remotely.
 I have an app locally in docker, debug server running inside the docker, exposing port for connection.
 It seems I need to set up an lsp-docker.yml file but I cannot find a single reference specific to debugpy (which is a relatively common debugger - it's a ms product designed for vscode - I would change it to pdb but team project and not possible)
 Anyone has experience working with this?

 Elfeed with date column
 However, when I run my elfeed search screen in Spacemacs, I don't see the date listed.
 Elfeed without date column
 Is there a specific configuration variable that I need to change? I looked through the elfeed docs, but I did not find any references to this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a pretty good working setup for completions, but there is one annoyance that I haven't figured out how to change. I'm writing both python and rust, and my issue is that when I select a completion for a function name or class, it always puts opening and closing parenthesis after it, automatically. Meaning, I type:
 my_obj.beginning_of_metho
 and it (corfu) gives me the option:
 beginning_of_method
 I select it, and what it inserts is:
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)
 Which is right 80% of the time, and infuriating that 20% of the time that I needed to pass that bare function somewhere. Its more annoying with class names, it puts parens in when I'm just trying to make a type hint. 
 I've seen this behavior with rust-analyzer, jedi-language-server and pyright, so I don't think its server specific, and I've seen it with lsp-mode and eglot so I don't think its specific to those modes. I'm using corfu, but I haven't figured out a switch in corfu to change this behavior.
 The ideal behavior in my opinion would be when I select the method name, it inserts just that:
 my_obj.beginning_of_method
 And then if I type an open paren
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(
 At that point it would insert the args with the closing paren.
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)
 Has anyone else figured out how to do this? I can't be the only person annoyed by this behavior.

I have some complex objects in my code, by complex I mean that they describe “actions” and they have an impact, may have preconditions, and may have incompatibilities. All these elements are maps from the same set of keys to to integer values. And these values may be 0, 1… or max-1, max (where max is maximum value) They are now described in my Scala code, but would like to give some SME, non programmers, the ability to modify them. I must say that the I find the Scala code reasonably easy to read, but probably will be error prone. From a usability perspective do you have any experience on what would work better? - Teach some Scala (case classes mostly) - Build a DSL - Provide a GUI

 When I try same with `git worktree add -f ../new-work-tree main` is it able to create directory and checkout just fine.
 Am I missing anything here? 
 Also side-note: I see these "file missing" errors also when using other modes. Wondering if there any variables I can set to make it default behavior everywhere.

 However, there was no need to use the State monad. Just mconcating endomorphisms s -> s is the appropriate way to solve the problem https://stackoverflow.com/a/3411461.
 Can someone suggest a toy programming puzzle where you actually need to use the computation result a in the State monad s -> (s, a)

 Typically, in java, I just add a breakpoint or at least add logs. I'm not sure how to do this in scala.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am relatively new to using `elfeed`. I used it years ago, then I forgot about it for a while, and recently came back.
 So I was wondering about the current best way to filter the posts by tags, so that I can focus on specific groups of posts instead of the entire stream. I was looking at Mike Zemansky's approach to filter the posts using a hydra and a macro. It looks pretty good, and I was working towards that. However, I realized that this approach was 7 years old. 
 Hence, I was wondering if there are any better or improved ways to filter posts today, that were not referenced in Mike Zemansky's post? I believe in his code, emacs looks for all unique tags in the total feed, defines shortcut or hydra keys, and finally creates a hydra that the user can use to search for those posts. So it seems simple and nice. 
 But as I said, I was not sure if there was a package to do this now, or do I have to write that code myself in my `.spacemacs` file. Any suggestions are welcome.

However, for a large repository that I am currently using, switching between branches or refreshing the magit refs buffer takes a minute or more on a modern macbook, and emacs gets hung up for a long time. The output after magit-toggle-verbose-refresh shows the largest time consuming operation
 magit-insert-tags 50.73 
 I tried to disable it with
 (remove-hook 'magit-status-sections-hook 'magit-insert-tags) 
 in init.el however I get a completely blank magit refs buffer after that, and plus I don't want to disable it for all repositories. I also tried including
 ((magit-status-mode . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter 'magit-insert-tags))))) ((magit-refs-mode . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter 'magit-insert-tags))))) 
 in the .dir-locals.el file but that didn't have any effect.
 I am wondering how I could disable magit-insert-tags while also displaying the branches. I am inclined towards repository specific rather than an init.el solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to move away from using bespoke query building logic in a Haskell service at work. My impression from surveying some of the popular options (Beam, Persistent, Opaleye...) is that while they have tools to pull schemas and synchronize with your database, they still require you to manually declare types corresponding to tables. 
 This Haskell service is however one of many accessing the database and the schema changes somewhat frequently, so manually keeping types in sync isn't ideal. In the parts of our codebase that are written in TypeScript we use libraries like prisma and prisma-kysely to generate type definitions and the experience has been pretty good. 
 Is there anything like this in the Haskell space? My hope is that I wouldn't need to manually edit type definitions if someone else at the company adds a table or changes a column somewhere in the DB.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, I've stayed at my job for 6 years. In my country there were at some point max 3 - 4 companies using Scala, even not full time, and now it is even rarer. When I got my first interview for a international remote job I had about 1.5 years of Scala experience, but 4 years total experience. I went pretty far but didn't get it because lack of experience. After that, I've had up to a dozen of these kinds of interviews, for a remote international team, but I never managed to get a job. Now finally I have found a new job but it is not a great project and not what I want.
 I am not the most enthusiastic person when it comes always being up to date and reading blogs and stuff and also for the past years, I have not been a person who got assigned to the more complex stuff in my company. Otherwise I have a pretty good basis for algorithms and coding challenges (although I failed the last one which was live coding using lots of Scala generics).
 Now, it seems to me that when recruiting for a remote team, especially for a senior position, the stands for a Scala developer are pretty high and the projects are not simple (relatively, like more distributed stuff).
 Does anyone have more insights how this compares to other languages. A lot of people that I know which I wold think were at my level as a developer or even sub, got remote jobs or jobs away from my country, and I am feeling stuck. I keep wondering if it would have been easier to find this kind of remote job if i stayed with C# or moved to Java, and not due to lack of opportunities in the Scala world....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really like the indicators (specifically for headings) provided by org-margin, but it does not work with org-indent-mode. Is there a way to get these two to work together or to possibly do something similar to org-margin? Thanks.
 Update...
 I ended up just overriding the function org-margin-mode-on by removing the piece that threw the error. Not sure if this is a particularly good idea, but everything seems fine for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty new to Haskell, enjoying developing a web app using Scotty, but I'm struggling to figure out how I can launch (background) async IO operations.
 For example, let's say I have a handle function:
 ```haskell longBackgroundIOStuff :: IO () ...
 handleSomething :: ActionM () handleSomething conn = do my_param :: String <- pathParam "my_param" -- I want to start this running liftIO $ longBackgroundIOStuff -- and then immediately respond to the client a redirect redirect "/" ```
 But then it has to wait for the longBackgroundIOStuff before redirect. If I put the redirect before the IO operation the IO operation never runs. I've also tried craziness like.
 ``` import Control.Concurrent.Async (concurrently_)
 handleSomething :: ActionM () handleSomething conn = do liftIO $ concurrently_ (liftIO $ longBackgroundIOStuff) (return (redirect "/")) ```
 But then the redirect never gets back to the client.
 I don't need to return anything related to the longBackgroundIOStuff, I just want it to start running in the background and keep running until it's done. 
 Using express with node I could just do something like this:
 js app.get('/', (req, res) => { longAsyncIOFunction(); res.redirect('/') }); 
 What would be the best way to accomplish this with Scotty? Thanks so much and sorry if this isn't the best forum for these kinds of questions.

 and then, for instance:
  someFun :: Int -> IO () someFun initial = print $ funGeneric () initial 
 where I'd expect funGeneric to be re-written to funSpecialized The rule itself type-checks, but no matter what I try, it never fires due to:

 In Scala 2.13 we were using the TypeCase from Shapeless library to overcome type erasure in pattern matching. demonstration:
 private val `Seq[AlertEntity]` = TypeCase[Seq[AlertEntity]] def onGetAlerts(arg: Any): Unit = arg match { case `Seq[AlertEntity]`(alerts) => () } 
 It was pretty convenient.
 Now upgrading to Scala 3 and checking if there a new canonical way to do it or if I should best stay with the current implementation.
 Saw TypeTest but wasn't sure how to use it even for this simple example.

Announcing ghciwatch 1.0 by Rebecca Turner
At Mercury, we’ve developed a file-watching recompiler for Haskell projects called ghciwatch, which loads a GHCi session (a Haskell REPL) and instructs it to reload or add modules when files in your project change. Ghciwatch is very similar in design to Neil Mitchell’s excellent ghcid, but with a few new tricks up its sleeve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using emacs to write Common Lisp code, and paredit doesn't respect the syntax of read macros. So, for example, when I write #P or #C or any other dispatch read macro(like my lovely home-brew λ)and open parenthesis or double quotes, it will insert a space before inserting the pair, and I have to double back to erase it. It's a really minor inconvenience, but I'm wondering if there's already a good solution to this problem or if anyone would be interested in improvement to paredit to correct this.
 You can just disable the behavior by adding to your .emacs, or whenever after paredit is loaded, 
 (defun paredit-space-for-delimiter-p (endp delimiter) nil) 
 But obviously this is a bit of a hack, and though I might try this out for now because I haven't ever noticed the space-adding behavior to be useful, I might find I'll miss it when it's gone, and want a more syntax aware paredit. 
 I noticed there's also a paredit-space-for-delimiter-predicates variable which you could use(or just use to disable the behavior in a less hacky way), but I would need to somehow query slime/swank to to robustly find out what the active read macros are(and I don't know how to do that at the moment), as well as actually parse them(which is messy but doable).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 This is a package (early WIP, but usable for now) that enables formatting code in buffers via text properties.
 Long story short, it allows you to use any formatting function/command (like format-all-buffer or apheleia-format-buffer) to visually format the code in the buffer without actually modifying it. This is acheived by changing the text properties of the code with the spaces taken from the formatted code.
 This can be useful when working in a team and the codebase is poorly formatted, or when you don't like the coding style and you want to view the code in the style you like.
 This can be seen as an ~equivalent~ to Resharper's Virtual Formatter, which I just heard about when I started working on this package, but never used it actually.
 The current implementation requires treesit, so you will need Emacs 29+ with Tree Sitter support.

Since I give my habits specific time slots during a day (I'm trying to be consistent of WHEN I do my habits), it would be nice to have them show up in relation to the current time.
 So I'm considering just removing the habit style and just setting them up as recurring scheduled TODOs but I want to confirm there aren't other beneficial features to keeping it as a habit that I might not be aware of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run many Elisp scripts on my org-node zettelkasten, which is 2000+ Org files. So I've had plenty of situations where I hit this old nugget:
  File mode specification error: (file-error Cannot open load file Too many open files debug) 
 Now I'm wondering why. I take care to kill the buffer on each iteration, but it doesn't seem to matter. But! If I let a function process only 500 files, then finish, then run it again for the next 500 and so on, it works out. Is the call stack holding on to all file descriptors opened by children?
 Anyway, a problem I cannot solve: I have no insight into the org-publish codebase, and recently I found that the count of files I want to publish has exceeded 1024. So now I cannot publish. Has anyone worked around that? My publish code.
 Root of the issue 
 On Linux you might think the issue is ulimit -n which defaults to 1024 (on Debian at least), but it turns out that even if you increase that then Emacs will just die. The base problem sounds like a compiled-in FD_SETSIZE value of 1024.
 Last year it seems someone tried to patch it: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-05/msg00115.html but this person says it just made Emacs unresponsive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just had this idea and I think it'd be pretty useful. Knowing emacs, there's a good change that either it's already a package or a snippet exists online. 
 The idea is this. After entering a command, say M-x compile <long compiler query>, I decide that I want it to be easily repeatable. So I then invoke a hypothetical M-x bind-last-command-to and it prompts for a key, say I now press <f5>. Now that compile command is bound to <f5>.
 I guess this is kind of like macros, but you bind it after the fact. And it is for a single command (even if it only worked for the last M-x compile it'd still be useful).
 Anyone know if it exists before I start trying to implement it myself? Thanks.

 Are there any elisp magicians who know how to make it automatically prefer the C file in this case and jump to it directly without opening a buffer with the choices, and maybe also display a message "both .c and .h files found; using the .c" or similar?
 Or anyone could point me to the docs for this kind of thing, I'm a bit lost.

 If I start typing, it gives me autocomplete options for all functions from any package it knows about -- awesome.
 But if I do
 import qualified Data.ByteString as B B.p 
 The B.p will give completion options for all functions starting with the letter p from any package, rather than only showing functions from Data.ByteString.
 Is this how it's supposed to work? Are there any workarounds/customizations that will make it useable? There's no point in autocomplete if I have to type out the whole function name to eliminate irrelevant functions.

 I’ve managed to setup lsp-mode with Omnisharp and enabled decompilation, so I am able to use “go to definition” on .NET system types and external class libraries that are referred to in my project as nuget packages. 
 However if I have a class A in an external nuget package, and let’s say it refers to another type in another nuget package or a .NET system type, then I can’t go to definition from within class A to these types. 
 Rider allows me to do this, but Omnisharp can’t and this is one of the most useful features I use in Rider when debugging or trying to understand the code, and is the one thing that prevents me from going full Emacs for my C# development. 
 Is this a limitation in Omnisharp or can somebody share how to set this up, so I can decompile also referenced code from within a referenced nuget package?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, i'm working on moving the final pieces to org note taking. Many people recommend using git for notes. And on the surface this makes sense. It's easy to use, automatic history and off device. But how do you deal with Personal Information in your Notes? Some of it might not be particularly interesting, but when you start using Due Dates and make Tasks on where to go, or whome you interact with, this could be different. Maybe you take a reminder to pick up some medication specific to a Illness you have.
 This might be even more of a problem if you use Org notes at work. Certainly most companies wouldn't want you to commit customer data to github/lab.
 So, how do you deal with this? So far the obvious thing is to keep Notes that are work related in their own folder and either not sync that or keep it on our own hosted gitlab instance.
 With personal notes this is a tougher call. I want them on two PCs and my phone. My experience with Syncthing over three devices in the past has been less than stelar. Any other recommendations that work reliably so i can finally leave google keep and todoist behind? (And yes, i know it's a bit ironic to care about personal information in org files in a git repo, when it's currently all on google and todoist servers. But i want to improve things ;) )
