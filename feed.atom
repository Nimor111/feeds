        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instead of making a lot of playlists with many repeated songs, like "Rock", "Best Rocks", "Rocks from 80s", "Rocks for workout", I would like to be able to tag songs similar to org tags:
 Song 1 - :80s:rock:best:workout:
 Song 2 - :anime:rock:best:workout:
 Song 3 - :funk:game:mario:cover:
 Song 4 - :rock:workout:
 And be able to build playlists based on combination of tags, for example :best: should give me songs 1 and 2, :rock:workout:, should give me songs 1, 2, 4, and so on.
 Is there some package for that today, or some similar feature in EMMS?
 I have a org file for a list of favorite games and some tags to filter games based on wether its for pc or some console, if it supports single player mode, 2P, 4P, offline party, online, coop and/or versus, and I can filter the list to find the best games to play with my friends or by myself, and it works pretty well.

 However, when I exit Emacs, that icon remains in the dock (middle section), so if I open Emacs (the same way) again, I get yet another Emacs icon.
 Why is Emacs and/or MacOS doing that, especially the multiple icons? 
 (But also, why is it not "activating" the Emacs icons that's already in the left part of my Dock (that is, displaying the little black "app is running" dot below the icon)?)
 Thanks.

The type system, the for comprehensions, the most advanced pattern matching I've seen anywhere and my favorite error handling system with Options and Eithers - all of these lead to great software where a lot of errors are prevented at compile time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I've wanted to use the `compile` command for a while but I found it annoying that it doesn't give you auto complete based on previous commands you have run. I tried to search how to get this effect since I assumed other would have wanted it too but to my surprise my google-foo failed me. 
 I ended up reading some emacs docs and to my surprise it wasn't that hard to do, so I want to share my solution here, potentially to help others who care about this and maybe to get feedback on my solution since over all I'm relatively new to 'hacking' emacs.
 My solution involves overwritting the `compilation-read-command` function to hook it up with `completing-read`, and since I use vertico I get a nice completion ui around it in the minibuffer.
 ;; compilation-read-command uses `read-shell-command` by default, which doesn't use ;; completion at all. So I overwrite it to use `completing-read` instead, which seems to work great. (defun compilation-read-command (command) (completing-read "Compile command: " compile-history nil nil command (if (equal (car compile-history) command) '(compile-history . 1) 'compile-history)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did a little bit of research in this, and apparently docker-tramp https://github.com/emacs-pe/docker-tramp.el can allow someone to access docker from within emacs and but now this feature is built-in in emacs >= 29. The reason I brought up even docker tramp is the website says that someone can do the same things with podman for these emacs version.
 I know there is a docker package in emacs that allows it to manage docker containers witihin emacs. But I don't need that level of control for podman. What do I need, as the title says, is to access the podman containers. To clarify futher, what I want to do is: say when I am working on a project and I want to evaluate a snippet of code using C-c C-c inside a org src code block, I don't want emacs to use my system's environment but the environment of the specific container I would like to use.
 If it were a whole file, eg, I would simply enter the podman container using eshell/vterm and evaluate the document, but, when I am writing in prog-mode instead of org-mode, the formatters and linters for that program would work if they are installed in the main system. But how do I use podman containters stuff? I mean there is good document, I think, for docker but not so much for podman.
 I tried researching on this but I could not find any example code since I don't know lisp to write my own. But I really could use someone's help in writing one. Maybe, since docker and tramp are related, going through tramp manual I might find some help. But has anyone here tried setting up emacs the way I want and used podman? And would it be easy to set up like that?
 EDIT: Sorry for not just paragraphing it properly. But the post did not even make any sense. My dyslexia kicked in and made such brutal mistakes. Appreciate the patience, and hope the post makes sense now.
 EDIT: Just to further clarify, emacs is not installed inside the container but installed in the system.

 So within Emacs itself, attempting to reload with either "doom/reload" or "SPC h r r" opens up Notepad with "doom.ps1", the Powershell file. Closing the Notepad window prompts the "config successfully reloaded!" message in Emacs, but fails to load any changes.
 Does anyone know what the deal is with that?

 I believe his themes use a different method for that.

 I am trying to create a custom section to the agenda (at the end, using org-agenda-finalize-hook)
 My goal is to add some hyperlinks to files in this agenda. I am able to create the section and add text with properties, but I have discovered that org-mode style links do not work (they are simply rendered as text).
 Does anybody have any recommendation on where to look for information on how to do this? Ideally I would like to insert links similar to those already supported in org (eg. [[uri][description]]).
 Edit: surprisingly, both the URL and description are links and work! but they are not properly rendered (the braces and the uri are not hidden)
 thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a continuation of the thread Developers Have Jobs to Do.
 I took the time to document my experience installing emacs and bedrock, and configuring it for python development. The immediate goal is great Emacs support for python developers accessible via Github.
 https://github.com/gregfelice/emacs-dx/blob/main/emacs-dx-profile-python-developer.md
 A summary analysis: 
  
bedrock can be an accelerant leading to a good experience for python.
 work needs to be done to get to a good python development ux out of the box.
 external dependency guidance (and hopefully more automated setup) is critical.
  
Next steps: 
  
get in touch with bedrock authors. see if they could help answer some of the questions raised by the research. 
 get feedback from community: emacs-dx issues is open on github. feel free to create an issue if 1) you have some guidance (or code) that solves a problem raised by the research 2) you have something you'd like to see offered in the python developer profile.
  
Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've googled for about 1.5 hours and I can't find a solution for this. Using my local MacBook to edit a file with Emacs on a remote MacMini via SSH+Tramp:
 `^X^F/scp:mac-mini:bin/new-shell-script.sh` 
 When I open the file, Emacs automatically changes the file-endings to 'Mac' conventions: Mode line:
  `U(Mac)...` 
 This is the wrong file ending convention and the script will fail when I try to run it which results in a head-scratching debugging session. Clicking the 'M' and U(Mac)... changes the file ending standard to utf-8-unix and saves the file but then Tramp immediately changes the convention back to the wrong file ending conventions. This sets me up for another WTF debugging session. I've tried setting the file conventions with a local buffer variable but that doesn't help as the file immediately reverts to Mac line endings after each save. I have two questions:
 Q: First, I'm just looking for a work around here. Can I put something into my: 
 `# -*- mode: shellscript; ... -*-` 
 mode line that will force my desired file ending convention? Emacs and Tramp seem to be convinced that in this environment is should be utf-8-hfs-mac when I want utf-8-unix. I'm looking for a file-local temporary fix here but google seems to be convinced that I'm better off chasing the setting of these variable each time I have a problem like this and I do actually use TRAMP to edit files on foreign filesystems irregularly. So, most of the time TRAMP gets this right, it's just that this time, TRAMP is getting it wrong which is adding 3 items to my debugging stack making a simple problem hard to debug.
 Q: Second, I've searched for about 1.5 hours along the subjects of "emacs line endings", "emacs normal mode", "emacs mode-line" and none of them have answered my question. What subject should I be searching for to fix this?

 The way forward, it seems, would be to use something that is syntax-aware. This realistically seems like the only way to do what I want.
 I asked ChatGPT and it suggested tree sitter. I know that tree sitter support is now natively in Emacs as of 29.1. I've never used it before.
 Is tree sitter the best thing to use for creating a syntax highlighting mode that is grammar-aware? Or would there be another way?

 extremely rarely, I get a malloc error where it says there was some error in re-alloc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mean both 'deriving' and 'deriving via' -- these are absolutely amazing features of Haskell. I think a lot of haskellers just use them without giving it much thought.
 But my question: what other languages offer such features? I know OCaml has its ppx mechanism that lets you do this (viz: ppx_deriving with more information on such things at the Ocaml metaprogramming page). I can't actually think of other languages that do it in quite this way.
 Of course a lot of very dynamic languages (in the SmallTalk family) let you do this. So I'm mainly interested in 1) typed languages (sorry Racket, doing 'TypedRacket' with macros is very cool, but quite different; a 'deriving' mechanism *for* TypedRacket would be in scope, if it exists) and 2) where this is done in a wholly separate phase, i.e. not at run-time.

 Hi community. I've used Emacs for over 30 years. I've recently started using it again for python and react development. While I love some of what Emacs has to offer, it's continued to be a frustrating and problematic ramp. It's hard to get it where I need it as a professional developer.
 Even after all these years, I still feel Emacs has so much untapped potential, but there's problems holding it back.
 Rather than just walk away, I decided to write up and share my ideas. I want to give back to Emacs by collaborating on a solution that gets it used and driving real value for more people.
 The document shares ideas on how to help developers quickly get productive with Emacs on the tasks that matter to them. I deeply believe we can increase the number of developers who try Emacs, get value quickly enough to use it more, and promote its virtues to friends.

Alternatively use ;;tempel-complete' if you want to see all matches, but then you ;; should also configure tempel-trigger-prefix', such that Tempel ;; does not trigger too often when you don't expect it. NOTE: We add ;;tempel-expand' before the main programming mode Capf, such ;; that it will be tried first.

 (add-hook 'conf-mode-hook 'tempel-setup-capf) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'tempel-setup-capf) (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'tempel-setup-capf))) 
 ``` In the GUI version, TAB always triggers indent-for-tab-command. I'm using Doom Emacs with Evil mode enabled. Any insights from the experts?

I also put together a an Integrated Writing Environment (IWE) for NeoVim for other users like me. I even spoke at a couple of NeoVim confs since then. Suffice to say I love NeoVim. 
 I also love tinkering with my computers endlessly when I am not working, naturally my brain has always been interested in seeing what emacs can do. 
 Tried Emacs for the last 3 years, but kept hitting a wall. Or just plain frustration. 
 Until I tried this Emacs kickstarter for NeoVim users.  
 And everything clicked. 
 I had a few _oh shit_ moments the last few days. Can't say I am a convert yet - I still think Vim motions is subjectively better for pure text manipulation - but for pure hackable joy, emacs all the way. 
 So far: 
  
Moved from using Org mode in NeoVim to Emacs.
 
I give myself an hour everyday where I turn off evil mode and just use pure emacs bindings. I still feel like I am playing jazz piano but it is now almost intuitive. 
 
Started browsing some documentation sites purely through eww
 
I can control spotify?!
 
 Things that aren't working yet: 
  
LaTeX live previewing. Can't figure out why because my Tex installation works perfectly on NeoVim using vimtex. I'll figure it out in a couple of days
  
Carry on. 
 TLDR: I (almost) see the light.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am wondering if one can use an org-file for cron jobs. 
 Benefits would be all the structure/folding/navigation benefit and everything (logging + code) would be in one place.
 On a theoretical level: Is this smart or dumb? Curios what your opinions are!
 And on a practical level: How can I let "org-babel-load-file" update the #+RESULTS section?
 I have this MWE:
 #+title: Cronjobs #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results output prepend (princ (concat "I'm here because someone run the code block at " (current-time-string) ".")) #+end_src #+RESULTS: : I'm here because someone run the code block at Fri Oct 18 08:39:30 2024. : I'm here because someone run the code block at Fri Oct 18 08:39:27 2024. 
 But the printed results came from C-c C-c-ing the code block. Running org-babel-load-file does print the message but doesn't modify the file...
 Best

 So my question is that how I can preload the org mode in the background ?
 use case:
 I open the emacs every morning and I start to read a file or do something ...
 I used to open my daily.org file but I have to wait a lot because to load the org package is very slow (~5-10 sec)...
 I'm using win10 or win11 and I know it is because the windows os but I thought that maybe we can preload the org mode in the background :)
 do you know any solution for this ?
 If I think well the witheditor is working like I open a file with emacsclientw.exe ... so maybe I can use this one to preload the daily.org in the background ...
 I don't know what is the trick in the async package so maybe any guidance is needed if I can solve this issue with this package ...
 I know we should load a package in the ui thread but what is if I open an org file with an emacsclient, will it freeze my every emacs frames for this short (5-10sec) period ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am an low / intermediate Java and Fortran programmer, and I am interested in broadening my knowledge beyond object-oriented programming, and since I have liking for "Vintage" stuff, and for high skill curves, I figured why not try Haskell. The issue is that I have been pulling my hair out trying to get VSC to run my Haskell code, and was wondering one of the following:
 Is there an equivalent to Java's BlueJ in the respect that it is an easy all-in-one editor, compiler, and terminal that does not need any dependencies preinstalled,
 or if there is just a simple way to get Haskell running in VSC that I'm not familiar with. 
 Honestly, considering how much time I have dumped into trying to get VSC to work I would prefer an equivalent to BlueJ at this point. Considering how refined VSC is, it's definitely just a skill issue that I've failed to get this to work lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm mostly doing python programming with Python using emacs and LSP. Sometimes I switch to Code to prototype some notebooks. Now I thought the last step can also be done in org-mode which suits me better ( No switching to Code). However, I seem to be loosing all LSP functionalities and basically I'm on my own.
 Any idea how I can deal with this inconvenience?

 Powershell: Windows terminal emulator, running wsl
 iTerm2: macOS terminal emulator
 Terminal: whatever is default installed in Ubuntu/Crostini
 Termux: terminal emulator on Android, with Unexpected Keyboard (available on F-Droid) for full keyboard
 Zsh: cross platform shell with a bunch of plugins for auto completion
 Mosh: ssh client that auto-reconnects without losing session information
 GNU Screen: Outer layer of multiplexing terminal sessions, allows switching between multiple tmux sessions in a single terminal window
 Tmux: Inner layer of multiplexing, hosts various emacs instances for whatever I'm working on
 Emacs: default keybindings, MELPA package repo, magit, various lsps (python, typescript, elixir), flycheck, company
 On system startup my launch procedure is:
 mosh , screen, tmux, emacs -nw
 Haven't had to change any key bindings and can easily switch through panes/sessions without ever touching my mouse on laptop. 
 What is your emacs terminal setup? 
 I haven't changed mine in years, so I'd like to hear about others' setups and try some new things!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What do you think about open source software bounties? I keep seeing them, for instance SoftwareMill offering them in the ScalaTimes letter today, or com-lihaoyi a while ago, or John DeGoes in his new Golem venture.
 They seem to offer developers a chance to contribute to open source code, hone their coding skills, get experience, and they might also be getting paid for that work.
 I considered contributing to one of com-lihaoyi bounties, specifically, implementing support for ms sql. However, I noticed someone else got the torch. And that gets to my point. You have N developers working on the same thing. Sure it works to the advantage of the entity that issued the bounties. But 1 out of the N developers will be successful. What if a developer starts working on it, then drops the ball because it turns out it is too much work and she/he doesn't have enough time? As a matter of fact, com-lihaoyi increased the bounty for ms sql support because there is more work than it was originally anticipated (see the pull request here: https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/scalasql/pull/29 ). Right now, I am not sure where that work is at.
 I feel that these bounties might drag (some) developers in a rat race. You might argue that a monetary retribution is better than nothing, and in the end nobody forces you to do anything if you don't want to, and I agree 🤷‍♂️ . Maybe I am missing something about how the oss bounties work.
 I think the ideal process would be to hire a developer to commit and to do the work in a time frame agreed upon by both parties, and to pay her/him properly. But I understand that might not be always feasible due to lack of funds and time, hence the bounties. I would be interesting to see the real-life experience of a someone that issued bounties and how that turned out.

 I've been coding with emacs since 1984. That's a long time. Over the years I've been forced by work circumstances to use various IDE's, including more recently vscode (like everybody) but despite adding "emacs modes" to these IDE's they just were never really just... emacs.
 My young coworker asked me this week why in fact do I use emacs. He's a thirty-something and had never even heard of it. I didn't have a great answer... muscle memory? learned in college? macros? it works the same everywhere? highly portable? All these answers are somewhat... outdated these days. That said, whenever I'm forced to use vscode, and even think about a mouse when coding, I loathe it. That hatred of the IDE slows me down. Vscode is so visually busy with so many flyovers and "he…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Some months ago I switched to Emacs, and right now I'm using as WM with EXWM and as clojure editor. I must say my config file is totally based in other config file I followed from System Crafter videos. I'm so happy and want to get more and more from Emacs. I use Intelij IDEA to develop on a Java project with Cuba framework, and I would like to use emacs instead. Mostly I only need autocompletion, Fast Class switching, Go to definition and so on...and launch gradle tasks like build, deploy. The things is I don't have idea how. I followed the config from the video "From Vanilla Emacs to Java" but I don't get autocompletion at all. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was writing my Scheme interpreter (like everyone does) but found a problem when implementing closures. Since I use the State monad to manage the symbol environment containing the variables etc. I have to copy it to the closure. This snapshot of the environment is then used any time the function is evaluated. But that means that any changes to the env after the definition are ignored. In scheme later changes can however still affect the closures env:
 (define n 2) (define foo (lambda (a) (define m 10) (+ a n (- m 3)))) ;; everything after here doesnt belong to the lambda env currently (define n 10) (write (foo 4)) ;; should use n = 10, but still uses n = 2 
 I know other people have used the IORef to solve this with actual mutability, but I wanted to know if there is another way of still using the state monad, before having to rewrite my entire program.
 The lambda environment should also affect the actual environment if it mutates an outer variable using set!.

 Let's say I have a recurring task in Agenda like
 * TODO Water the flowers weekly SCHEDULED: <2024-10-17 Thu 09:00 +1w> 
 If I this week decide I instead should water the flowers on friday, I just press the S-RIGHT (org-agenda-do-date-later)
 But then it (as is described in manual) moves all instances of "Water the flowers" to Fridays.
 Is there an (easy / built in) way of pushing a single instance of a recurring event forward to Friday, while keeping the rest of the instances on Thursday? 
 My guess is not, as it would require somehow cloning the instance for this week as a new task and leaving the recurring task alone?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hy!
 I worked with scala 2.12-2.13 for years, but in the last 2 years I'm out of the loop. One of my "ongoing" projects has a scala 2.13 codebase, and the owners of the product asked me to start a new product mostly based on the prev codebase. So I need to start a totally fresh project, but I need the ability to fastly convert "old" code to this new codebase.
 The old toolstack heavily used cats (ET and OT, and SemiGroups), tapir with circe, slick, and akka (mostly streams and http, but some typed actors too). It used a lot of other smaller things like shapeless to help slick with tuples, pureconf for config parsing. Also I had a lot of extender methods and some implicit converters.
 The questions; - How mature and widely used scala3 is? - Can copilot or other tools convert scala2 code to scala3? - Starting a scala2 codebase in 2024 is a bad idea? - Do we have good learning materials for adoption? - Should I learn new libs if I change to scala3 or I can keep most of my "well known" ones?

I have been searching for a way to get org-mode html export to format this in the literary book style of indented first sentence, and soft returns/no gap lines.
 I was advised at Stackexchange Emacs to try this
 #+HTML_HEAD: <style>p { margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 2em; } </style> 
 And it worked. However, the fact that this references p is messing up other things in my ox-tufte like giving footnotes that 2em indent, as well as some images. So Plan B is just to use this without the text-indent: 2em; and tack @@html:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp@@ in front of all text paragraphs. So now I need a replace-regexp that will do this for paragraphs. M-x replace-regexp RET ^ RET @@html:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp@@t RET does it for every line in a buffer, but I need it for every paragraph. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I wanted to share this both for the laughs and maybe some guidance.
 I am a relatively young programmer, who so far have been my own master, so to speak. I was given big projects to finish on a deadline, but pretty much left to my own devices. All this changed rapidly at this new company.
 Now, my team leader left the company and got replaced with another one who has never had a managerial position before and is trying to micromanage me, which I resent with a passion, not just because of my character (who if I am being honest, responds well to criticism under conditions) but also because I feel he is not quite on par with my own skill level (perceived or not). I mean, I would ideally like to have a superior who I admire (perceived or not) and can learn from, and then I would embrace and indeed welcome both the manager and the criticism.
 Anyway, Now how does this relates to Emacs?
 Well, this guy at work cannot understand the way I program. It seems extremely alien to him because I find myself using common Elisp and functional idioms.
 I have started naming thinks like (buffer-or-name) or what have you.
 The use of monoids, etc etc.
 So, Emacs has forever made me an alien to the standard workplace culture.
 I mean this guy wants me to take my nicely single purpose functions and put them
 all within a Class in one huge file.
 I do not know if I can take it.
 How is this funny?
 I do not know, I find it funny that a 50 year old program is causing such trouble for a person 50 years after its inception.
 Thank you for your time.
 With <3 pnoul

 val sunMass = 1.99e30 val sunRadius = 6.96e8 val star = <star> <title>Sun</title> <mass unit="kg">{ sunMass }</mass> <radius unit="m">{ sunRadius }</radius> <surface unit="m²">{ 4 * Math.PI * Math.pow(sunRadius, 2) }</surface> <volume unit="m³">{ 4/3 * Math.PI * Math.pow(sunRadius, 3) }</volume> </star> 
 So exactly like this but with JSON where I can embed/evaluate expressions and store literal JSON as a first-class value in a variable? If not, any languages that do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/scala! If you're looking to get hands-on with some cutting-edge tech, check out Ergo. This isn’t a shill for just another blockchain, but an open-source platform packed with advanced scripting and cryptographic tools.
 You can experiment on the testnet or even fork your own chain to explore its potential. 
 Ergo is built on Scala, and its scripting language, ErgoScript (which is also based on Scala), goes beyond Bitcoin’s scripting by using ErgoTree byte code. This allows for complex coin spending conditions, enabling things like ring signatures, multi-signatures, multiple currencies, atomic swaps, self-replicating scripts, and long-term computations. ErgoTree itself is a typed abstract syntax tree, essentially a smart signature that validates transactions based on custom rules. With Secret Data Predicates (digital signatures, secret keys) and Blockchain Context Predicates (transaction-specific conditions), ErgoTree supports a range of applications beyond crypto, such as (decentralised) CBDCs, new monetary systems, Local Exchange Trading Systems, and pretty much anything else you can think up, can be done on ergo!
 Many of Ergo’s solutions are grounded in formal research and have been presented at peer-reviewed conferences. While ErgoScript isn’t Turing complete on its own, Turing completeness can be achieved through transaction trees, as outlined in this peer-reviewed paper.
 For those looking to earn while they learn, there are various bounties up for grabs, with rewards in stablecoins like SigUSD and Gluon Gold. Check out open bounties on the reference client and interpreter/compiler, or join the upcoming ErgoHack.
 An (incomplete) list of all repositories that use scala can be accessed here

 i'm doing small interpreter of simple programming language (as mental exercise), and when i read some post about it i find out an advice to use Fix or Free monad, because in this case i can get advantage of using implicit recursion instead of explicit one.

 Here is code snipped of both cases, what am i doing wrong of do not understand?

 It's working fine it most apps, but it doesn't work at all with Emacs. Pressing the option/compose key makes Emacs say: "C-<f13> is undefined".
 Does anyone in here have any suggestions for how to fix this? I'm not much of a power user myself.

 Using Emacs 29.4 on Linux, with LSP mode and flycheck, I've tried:
  
Omnisharp: incredibly slow and unstable, autocomplete dies often, but mostly complete
 csharp-ls: fairly quick, but chokes on some references (partial classes?)
 csharp-roslyn: quick, very snappy, works well - except it doesn't detect errors (!?)
  
Between the three of them there's an incredible LSP for me.
 Any help appreciated.
 
 Other details:
 I have it working fine in VS Code and Sublime Text.
 Here's my LSP doctor output:
  
Checking for Native JSON support: OK
 Check emacs supports `read-process-output-max': OK
 Check `read-process-output-max' default has been changed from 4k: OK
 Byte compiled against Native JSON: OK
 `gc-cons-threshold' increased?: OK
 Using `plist' for deserialized objects?: OPTIONAL
 Using emacs 28+ with native compilation?: OK

 The debugger buffer opens up but can't recognize the MI output of GDB as actual MI output.
 Error: Either -i=mi wasn’t specified on the GDB command line, or the extra socket couldn’t be established. Consider using M-x gud-gdb instead.
 The output in the buffer looks like what I'd expect if I ran gdb -i=mi in the terminal, but emacs just won't recognize it as such. Does anybody know if there's an issue with this mode on Windows? I have WinLibs on my path and I'm running emacs directly.
 If I use MSYS and run that Emacs from within an MSYS shell, things work as expected. I'd like to run Emacs directly and using WinLibs GCC/GDB etc (without going into an MSYS shell). Running gud-gdb works, but I'd really like to use MI instead of the simpler gud-gdb interface.
 WinLibs version details:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently saw a post about what keyboard people use for emacs and a lot of people say they use QMK keyboard which allow for custom layout, additional layers. 
 So far the extend of customization I've done regarding keybinds in within emacs itself, I was wondering what emacs specific customization you guys have made to the keyboard itself?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know almost nothing about orgmode aside from some videos here and there. In terms of programming and code I even know less. 
 I liked apps like Dynalist, Workflowy or Logseq for its infinite outlining capabilities and how fast and easy I could organize my ideas into infinite bullets.
 However, those apps have strong limitations: aside from Logseq they are cloud based(that makes me fear of losing my notes if the company disappears), they have monthly payment requirements for some features(again not Logseq) and they have clunky use or lack basic outlining things like numbered lists(on mobile at least) and so on. 
 Maybe those apps have workarounds to some of those problems but I ended up here since it seems orgmode solves all of the above problems, free, and it’s expected to last for as long as needed it. It sounds great to be honest.
 But…
 Is it too much? Is it too much effort to set up/learn? Will I be able to easily use it on multiple devices like pc, Mac, iOS with basic gdrive or iCloud sync without it being slow or having files rewriting themselves during those sync processes and losing information? 
 I fear I’ll need a masters degree in computer science to write my daily to do list or make a novel writing outline quickly(again I don’t know enough about the app)
 Any kind of advice would be welcomed.
 As a side note. I tried obsidian but I absolve need more advanced outline capabilities. Obsidian outlining plugins are way too basic and clunky.

 Personally it started as an exploration of the state of WASM support in Haskell and it turned out that it’s reasonably easy to get going. You might find the project’s sources useful to get started on your own WASM experiments since it a minimal working application with all the necessary stubs filled in.
 Please report any suggestions or issues you encounter in the repository. PRs are welcome as well!

 Autoreconf seems to want to a specific version of Perl published before the current stable release on Homebrew, which is confusing to me as I've been able to build the server just fine prior to today. I've tried updating Autoconf + it's dependencies and it was no use. Was wondering if anyone else has had a similar issue, could I maybe force Autoconf to use my installed version of Perl (5.38.2)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble with org-tables. When I hit tab to auto-align table cells after an edit, sometimes a row won't align. Looking into it, it turns out a character, often the pipe | but not always, somehow has a double width. Poking at it with describe-char shows the following:
 Character code properties: customize what to show name: VERTICAL LINE old-name: VERTICAL BAR general-category: Sm (Symbol, Math) decomposition: (124) ('|') There is an overlay here: From 36582 to 36583 face region priority (nil . 100) window #<window 9 on AIOTMLWTF> There are text properties here: display ((min-width ((2 . width)))) face org-table fontified t line-prefix #(" " 0 4 (face org-indent)) org-category "20210913T141637-aiotmlwtf" wrap-prefix #(" " 0 4 (face org-indent)) 
 I turned off various minor modes like visual-wrap-prefix-mode, visual-line-mode, visual-line-column-mode, and aggressive-indent-mode to no avail. So have no idea what causes the insertion of that special character feature. (Running a recent Emacs30.)

 I use eglot, corfu, and eglot-tempel (I also tried yasnippet, and still had a problem). The issue is with rust-analyzer, but I don’t think the exact LSP server should matter
 If I have a function foo_unique(bar), type f<TAB>, and select foo_unique, I get a snippet completion, which is good. If, however, I type foo_uniq<TAB>, it gets completed to foo_unique(…) (so my function is the only candidate), with an ellipsis symbol, cursor at the end, and no snippet interface.
 What could be the problem? This is clearly not something that should happen.

 I have started with a class like:
 haskell class KFunctor k (f :: k -> Type) where kMap :: somethingLikeAFunction k a b -> f a -> f b 
 Now I need to model somethingLikeAFunction somehow. My idea was to use a GADT or a type family, however, that does not work even for the simple case where the elements are of kind Type.
 haskell data Function k (a :: k) (b :: k) where SimpleFunction :: (a -> b) -> Function Type a b 
 haskell type family Function k (a :: k) (b :: k) where Function Type a b = a -> b 
 Both fail with "Expected a type, but 'a' has kind 'k'". I am wondering why GHC is not able to unify k with Type?

The version of emacs I'm trying to use is 29.4.1 from emascforosx.com and 29.4.2 on RHEL 8.9 via ETX. I also tried emacs -nw on the Linux box accessed via Terminal and ssh. Nada. ctl-up/down work fine. Also, ctl-left/right work in other Mac apps.
 I've been using alt-left/right but I have years of muscle memory so it's a pain. And a mystery. Any ideas? Things to check?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hallo
 my use case although noble is quite difficult, here the A) Abstract and B) Specific formulation:
 Abstract 
 I read a lot and want an efficient way to use the information i read inside the books
 Specific
 As reader I want to benefit from the content of the books i annotated, and kind of run queries to have the annotations available as i prefer. For instance I could have assigned a tag about a topic to every annotation, or a rating of importance from 1 to 10, and so I could have the need to retrieve the title of the chapters and paragraphs of a book, or the chapters, paraghraphs and notes, or and here becomes interesting all the notes that have a specific rating with a sparse tree (chapters, paragraphs) and notes with importance > 5 or even more interesting across the books with a specific tag as for instance statistics all the notes with a rating >9
 IMPLEMENTATION
 I do not know what is the most convenient way, really I have not idea, but i confine that there are other avid readers that develop org mode that thought about a convenient workflow
 * annotating pdf of digital documents so that can see on the side the original pdf and another side the notes and assinging multiple tags and running researches across the org files
 * using org roam to make a kind of wiki using a lot of links,or a lot of org files in subfolders and run a research with a kind of specialized engine to retrieve what I need
 * see if can use SQL in org files so that for instance the headers of one level would be assigned to a table/column, and the nested ones will be automatically assigned with an id beloging to the table or something similar that will simplify to transform the org mode to SQL
 * org table files
 * Some SQL tables in Postgree sql via a star model or model vault key that will be queried in some way inside org mode
 CONCLUSION
 All I want is to capitalize the books i read in a way I can extract information, confront sources, highlights, adding notes etc

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy, folks.
 So I kinda table-flipped a bit this week after getting fed up with having to keep moving org-agenda and gpt.el windows to a desired frame position. I went down the layout rabbit hole starting with activities.el and perspective.el being next in the queue.
 I like the UX of activities.el but I'm not a huge fan of having to create all of the frames I want, place them into desired position, and then save them as an activity. I would prefer to be able to define my layouts in elisp but I don't see a great way to do that with activities.el.
 Perhaps I've over-looked a possibility? Perhaps there's a way to programmatically define a bookmark that activities.el can then reference? Other ideas?

 But the moment I use a terminal e.g. Kitty / Alacritty etc.

 I have tried with different fonts but I suspect the choice of character is differently rendered in terminal mode.
 I am using the org-modern package and Doom etc.
 Could this be the culprit, if so is there work around for this perhaps the font for tables and border??

The expression evaluates correctly, the configuration is set to look for the function, yet I still have no luck. What am I overlooking? Is it simply sufficient to setq the gptel-apikey variable or do I need to create a separate make-openai block? Thanks!

 Examples:
 Example image from emacs' telephone-line
 Example image from nvim's lualine

 Current Understanding
 I believe that these are made with essentially a Unicode nerd font at the beginning and/or end of a text region with a colorful background. However, I am unable to replicate this well and it looks rather silly.

 im fairly new to NixOs so i might have made a mistake, especially when im using home-manager to configure neovim 
 (i will leave a part of home.nix in the comments) (if im able to i will also leave a link to a screenshot to show the almost lack of highlighting)
 i would really appreciate help in setting up the highlighting (every other plugin i enabled works fine)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there. I had an idea for a package, but it's the sort of thing that feels like it must already exist, and I'd love to look at existing packages before reinventing the wheel. 
 The basic idea would be that you could schedule code to run using org agenda entries with timestamps. For example, you could write an entry like 
 * Update the package cache :exec: :PROPERTIES: :TaskName: update-package-cache :END: <2024-10-14 Mon 14:00-16:00 +1w> 
 Then you'd define a search like +exec and associate functions to various task names. The package would provide a function/mode to set up timers to watch the agenda and run scheduled tasks when emacs is idle within the scheduled window. Maybe if the entry is a TODO, update the timestamp with org-mark-done.
 But yeah, this feels like the sort of thing that would already exist in some form. I've seen a few packages to notify about tasks, but not to act on them more generally. If anyone has any leads/thoughts, I'd appreciate it. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've started learning emacs recently, and after some experimentation I decided that I want to experience vanilla emacs navigation keybindings (moving the point around with C-f / C-n etc), without evil/meow/boon etc.
 I am a casual vim user, and otherwise used JetBrains IDEs for like 15 years now. I'm trying to switch to emacs to be more productive with editing code, because I feel like I use the mouse too much in JetBrains and it slows me down.
 Needless to say, I am suffering and it feels like torture. My question is that: are the vanilla emacs keybindings viable? Can you get used to it and be as fast as in vim, or as in other editors? Is anyone using the default keybindings, or are you all just rebinding those?
 If yes, how long it took for you to get used to it?

 I can't figure out how to properly lift the try value to match the transformer stack.
 Right now the error says: "Expected: IO (Either IOError Handle), Actual: t0 IO (Either IOError Handle)" when doing the lift operation. However I dont know how to remove the t0 type-var to properly match the type. Doing liftIO mismatches IO (Either ...) with StateT.

 cd "/ssh:username@host|docker:container_name:/" 
 Emacs functions like dired, find-file, etc work fine. However actual shell commands involving binaries on remote do not pick correct host. Emacs somehow remembered the first host that I accessed container with this name first and always runs shell commands there. Even if I explicitly run 
 "/ssh:username@host_that_I_need|docker:container_name:/bin/bash" 
 it always runs
 "/ssh:username@emacs_favorite_host|docker:container_name:/bin/bash" 
 When I do "C-x C-f" and just type "/docker:container_name:/" it also goes to "emacs_favorite_host". Do I need to configure something or this is how TRAMP normally works?

I exclusively used the timestamp method until I read the Bob Doto book, which completely changed by Zk practice, and now I happily merge the two.
First, the benefits of the two methods, as I have seen them expressed here. The timestamp method is flexible, and does not force us to choose a pre-meditated structure; the ZK can grow organically.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reading the thread of remaking emacs in a modern environment, apart from the C-core fixes and improvements, as always there were a lot of comments about elisp.
 There are a lot of people that criticize elisp. Ones do because they don't like or directly hate the lisp family, they hate the parentheses, believe that it's "unreadable", etc.; others do because they think it would be better if we had common lisp or scheme instead of elisp, a more general lisp instead of a "specialized lisp" (?).
 Just so you understand a bit better my point of view: I like programming, but I haven't been to university yet, so I probably don't understand a chunk of the most theoric part of programming languages. When I program (and I'm not fiddling with my config), I mainly do so In low level, imperative programming languages (Mostly C, but I've been studying cpp and java) and python.
 That said, what makes elisp a great language for emacs (for those who it is)?
  
Is it because of it being a functional language? Why? Then, do you feel other functional languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?
 
Is it because of it being a "meta-programming language"? (whatever that means exactly) why? Then, do you feel other metaprogramming languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?
 
Is it because of it being reflective? Why? Then do you feel other reflective languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?
 
Is it because of it being a lisp? Why? Do you think other lisp dialects would be better?
 
Is it because it's easier than other languages to implement the interpreter in C?
 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically the title. I think I remember reading somewhere it was officially recommended to switch the file extension to .txt and not use the unique .org extension as they are functionally the same. Both are plain text formats, you might just have different txt files, that are not formatted in orgdown there too. Is that all or have I missed something? Is there an actual downside like a dependency of org-roam that you end up in dependency hell if you decide to use txt or another file extension instead of .org. Bc otherwise everytime you don't have an org parser around and are on a system like a tablet, it will straight up refuse to open the file, locking you out of your data complete. This can be avoided by using orgdown formatting, but utilizing the .txt extension. 
 Cheers and thanks for your insights

 I am glad to say that I'm getting used to elisp. This is my second attempt on making an emacs package. This is called entr-runner.el, it permits to run custom commands on file or directory change directly inside emacs. 
 Check it out on : https://github.com/SamuelVanie/entr-runner.el
 I'll be happy to get feedbacks on the source code or any other things that will make a student like me a better programmer.

One concern I have is that HLS doesn't support the GHC WebAssembly and JS backends. (edit: I have managed to make HLS work with Miso, see comment) I'm interested in using Haskell on the frontend and would like to ask the sub a few questions.
  
If you've used Haskell on the frontend recently, what was your stack and how was your experience?
 In your opinion, what are the Haskell frontend setups with the best developer experience at the moment?
 Is Haskell on the frontend with HLS support likely to ever happen? Are there specific problems an individual developer can contribute toward solving to make it possible?

 I ended up setting the face attributes for highlight so that foreground is unspecified, and so that background is darker (I set it to default but darkened a bit further -> I found this works great for any theme, in my opinion.

 At first sight, they seem pretty similar. Both can hide modes, or change how they are displayed on the mode line; although I believe delight has a couple extra features.
 The Emacs manual recommends going for diminish if you have doubts, but why is that so? 
 What are their most important differences?

This is the result. (Install Hyperbole as an Emacs package from melpa or elpa-devel).
 The Hyperbole manual provides a wealth of information about Hyperbole's individual features, but let's explore how they can work together to achieve a specific work goal. Imagine you're working on a research project that involves:

 However, when I try to run the compiled object using: scala Twofer
 I get the following error: [error] Twofer is not a scala sub-command and it is not a valid path to an input file or directory.
 Try viewing the relevant help to see the list of available sub-commands and options.

 I also tried with the classpath: scala -cp . Twofer
 But the error persists. Can anyone help me resolve this issue?

 I am trying to build a template with minad's 'tempel' package. I want to mimic the behaviour found in this excellent article that uses yasnippet, specifically the "faster frac" bit https://karthinks.com/software/latex-input-for-impatient-scholars/#faster-frac
 Basically, I want to write for instance "3 fra" then I hit my tempel-complete key and then it expands to "\frac{3}{<cursor here>}". 
 I tried some variants and I tried to inspire myself of karthinks snippets, so I have the following template : 
 (fra (progn (backward-sexp) (kill-sexp)) "\\frac{" (current-kill 0) "}{" p "} " q)
 But, there is a problem. The placeholder p is not registered, the expansion is this "\frac{3}{} <cursor>". It quits directly I think. 
 Can someone help me ? I don't really understand what's happening. Why is the placeholder p skipped ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Haskellers,
 I'm writing a C compiler. In the assembly generation stage, an abstract syntax tree is converted into a List of x64 instructions.
 To model a C language expression as an AST node, I used this algebraic type:
 data Expression = Value Int | Unary Uop Expression | Binary Bop Expression Expression
 The Expression type is used to represented nested unary and binary expressions such as -2, -(~2), 1+3, (6 *2) + (5* (9 -2)), etc... Uop and Bop are unary and binary operators, respectively.
 Parsing these expressions recursively looks like a classic fold operation, and I implemented my own folding function that works. But I can't help but feel there's a better approach to this, a better abstraction to traverse a recursive data structure and "flatten" it into a List.
 Obviously I can't use Foldable since the datatype is not kind `* -> *`. Would it make sense to use a phantom type so that Expression is of kind `* -> *`?
 Any thoughts or suggestions would be helpful. Thanks

 If you had tried the integrations with other effect systems before, give it a try again and please report any issues!
 New Features
  
More flexible integration with ZIO and cats-effect: The integrations were previously implemented with custom effects, which had limitations with some Async operations. The new implementation is based directly on Async, allowing unrestricted use of ZIO and cats-effect computations with Kyo's async primitives.
 Safe class tags: The kyo-data module provides an alternative to Scala's ClassTag that can express union, intersection, and literal types. The SafeClassTag implementation ensures materialized tags always properly represent their types without falling back to java.lang.Object for special types like Any…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Parsec to write a math parser. The code here is working fine for parsing a number, either an Int or a Float but always returning a Float in Haskell (I want to add support for different types of numbers in the calculator later but for now its all floats).
 pNumber :: Parser MathExpr pNumber = N <$> (try pFloat<|> try pInt <?> "number") <---- line in question pInt :: Parser Float pInt = try $ read <$> many1 digit pFloat :: Parser Float pFloat = try $ read <$> do whole <- many1 digit point <- string "." decimal <- many1 digit return $ whole ++ point ++ decimal *Main Text.Parsec> parse (pNumber <* eof) "" "0.5" Right 0.5 *Main Text.Parsec> parse (pNumber <* eof) "" "1" Right 1 
 However if I change the line to: pNumber = N <$> (try pInt <|> try pFloat <?> "number") I get parse errors on the same input for decimal numbers:
 *Main Text.Parsec> parse (pNumber <* eof) "" "1" Right 1 *Main Text.Parsec> parse (pNumber <* eof) "" "0.5" Left (line 1, column 2): unexpected '.' expecting digit or end of input 
 Anyone know why this is happening? I have thrown trys all over to avoid consuming input when I don't want to.

 Previously I used eglot + flymake for JVM but my new job has heavily leaned into Mac + VSCode's devcontainers and in order to get a proper lsp environment and debugger I need to switch to lsp-mode + lsp-docker + dap-mode.
 The first step is getting lsp-mode connected to the webserver's container which has pyright as a dev dependency.
 Note, I'm also new to Python coming from a JVM and Lisp on Linux background so I may be making Python or Mac errors. I am also completely new to developing inside containers, I have previously only used containers for deployments.

 Their blog used to have comment functionality, but that is gone. I also could not find any email address or link to another profile.
 Since it appears to be difficult to come by this information, it could be that they don't want their identity known (though I was able to dig up a real name), so please send me this information privately. Thanks for your help!
 Of course it would be easiest if Irreal themselves saw this, which they probably will eventually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have used conduit a bit (not extensively, but somewhat) but I'm poking around at other streaming libraries, and I've noticed most of them design their streams much like lists, for example, in streamly, SerialT m a analogous to [a], and has the same usual Functor, Applicative and Monad instances.
 conduit on the other hand, has it's last parameter being a "result" type, which is NOT the output type of the stream, it's just a completely different single value. And it also seems like the conduit code suggests you just compose things with await and yield, instead of using more standard combinators like fmap, mapM and fold (although their are Conduit specific versions of things like fmap and fold which one can use).
 I feel like the conduit interface is a bit more clunky and not as "Haskell like". But I suspect there's a benefit of this... there's surely a reason why one would make the interface quite a bit different to what people are used to manipulating, namely lists?
 Could someone give some examples of things which work nicely in conduit but are clunky in more "list like" streaming libraries?
 Or are more recently developed streaming libraries just better than conduit in every way (which I find hard to believe)?

 Anyone else have the experience that when editing elisp, aggressive-indent will erroneously indent docstrings unrelated to the editing context like this: ``` (defun function-i-am-writing () ;; copy paste edit incomplete fragments that cause indentation below point (let ((x "x") ( )
 (defun foo () "This is a function called foo. It accepts no parameters." )  ...edit code allowing aggressive-indent to do its thing...and BAM!...flymake complains about new issues such as indented docstrings...  (defun foo () "This is a function called foo. It accepts no parameters." ; <- this is erroneously indented ) ``` In emacs-lisp-mode, I do have
  (setq-local aggressive-indent-comments-too nil) 
 not that I'm sure this does anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm having an issue where I have to hold on to Ctrl for a moment, then g in order to quit. Namely, exiting out of a completion - and deactivating a mark.
 If I press C-g once, I see a Quit in the echo area, but it's not quitting what I want it to. I have to hold Ctrl for a split-second, then g for it to work.
 Oddly this is only an issue if I'm focused on a buffer with display-line-numbers-mode on. If I turn it off, the problem goes away.
 This also only affects my Moonlander, a QMK keyboard. I tried using a standard keyboard and it was fine.
 I checked wevand the only difference is that the Moonlander registers the g input immediately (1 ms) after Ctrl, whereas the standard keyboard registered it around 100ms after.
 Is there a reason why keyboard-quit would not work if the interval between Ctrl and g is too short indisplay-line-numbers-mode? Is it because a keystroke will trigger some sort of background process or refresh - and that's the process I'm quitting with C-g if I do it too quickly?
 Thanks in advance if anyone has any ideas.

 Edit: Thanks to those who answered. The --debug-init flag helped. There were relative paths (I’m guessing) along with customisation lines set by emacs. But deleting that block helped. I’ve since learnt that I can move it to its own file.

18 months of the Haskell Unfolder by Edsko de Vries, Andres Löh
Eighteen months ago we launched The Haskell Unfolder, a YouTube series where we discuss all things Haskell. From the beginning the goal was to cover as broad a spectrum of topics as possible, as well as show-case the work of many different people in the Haskell world. We’d like to think we succeeded at that; below you will find a summary of the topics covered in the first year and a half, organized roughly by category.

 was curious about how Logseq, my note-taking daily driver, and org-mode compare to each other. i'll say i know next to nothing about org-mode and the usual text editors common in UNIX spaces apart from nano haha
 i like logseq mainly as it is a block-based outliner, and it has a workflow that heavily encourages using the journal / writing on daily notes, which thanks to its backlink features, tagging and very solid query system let you have a very efficient workflow where you just write stuff in the journal and then everything falls into place, given you configured stuff well.
 does org-mode let you have this same amount of "mindlessness" where you can just put notes, have them be organized by themselves and be done with it? i know you can add plugins in org-mode and other things but i wouldn't know of how to go about it, so i thought it better to directly ask people who have experience with the software.
 cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am considering switching to orgmode from Obsidian, so I am making the exact same post I made on Obsidian, since I would have a lot more incentive if orgmode or orgroam would have a way to do the things I mention in the following post, 
 Over the summer I changed my workflow by taking rigorous notes on the textbook I was working through, as a result I ended up with a beautifully distilled version of the chapters (pictured below).
 https://preview.redd.it/9pxpid8fvutd1.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf98f97a76d432b2530485811031a0fd6291e5b2
 Unfortunately even though these were great, this took too much time and I realized that I had spent a lot of time jotting down stuff that I could have just as easily highlighted. I needed to come up with a more efficient system, so after thinking about it for a while I came to the realization that the only new information in my notes would be of the following type:
  
Explaining a certain step of a derivation in more detail. (by adding more steps)
 Adding additional information that was relevant. (an alternate explanation or my own explanation)
 Connecting the given information with some other piece of information. (like how you link stuff in Obsidian)
  
That's how I came to the realization that if I could have like the comment feature that you usually have in word, but with more obsidian features for pdfs then that would be a game changer. For example, being able to upload a textbook to obsidian, then highlight a word/sentence or para (or the space in the between them) and then be able to write comments on it (both in Latex and normal text) or to be able to link that with other notes.
 I would be extremely grateful if somebody could let me know if there is a way to implement these features.
 Thnx!

 When using a package which needs curl I get the following error:
 ```
 ChatGPT(chatgpt-4o-latest/General)> test<shell-maker-end-of-prompt>curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificateMore details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html
 ```
 In this case it is using chatgpt-shell, but it's not exclusive to it.
 When I launch emacs with 'emacs' from the terminal this issue is not present, when I launch it from a shortcut the issue is present. The .desktop file is using the exact same binary:
 ```
 !/usr/bin/env xdg-open
 [Desktop Entry]
 Name=Emacs
 GenericName=Text
 EditorComment=Edit text
 MimeType=text/english;text/plain;text/x-makefile;text/x-c++hdr;text/x-c++src;text/x-chdr;text/x-csrc;text/x-java;text/x-moc;text/x-pascal;text/x-tcl;text/x-tex;application/x-shellscript;text/x-c;text/x-c++;
 Exec=emacs %F
 Icon=emacs
 Type=Application
 Terminal=false
 Categories=Development;TextEditor;
 StartupNotify=true
 StartupWMClass=Emacs ```
 I also tried a more minimal .desktop file and full path to the binary, /usr/bin/emacs in this case, with the same results.
 I know this issue is likely not caused by emacs itself, but in order to find the answer I think I'll need to know how/why emacs is different when launched with /usr/bin/emacs in the terminal vs /usr/bin/emacs from a .desktop file?
 Does anyone have any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 A bit of background: I come from more of a math/physics background, and got drawn into functional programming late in college, then took a compilers course in my last semester (in OCAML) and got really into it. Have a journeyman level understanding of other languages, have worked in SW for three years and counting.
 I have been making my way through the haskell MOOC (the university of Helsinki one). I stumbled on these two books which, by the accounts I have read previously, seem to go into more depth mathematically with respect to haskell. In the mean time tryng build up on C++, and learning small bits of CL here and there as well to get more perspective and be a better problem solver overrall.
 So, what I'm asking:
 From my understanding, Hutton (Programming in Haskell) is drier than Bird (Thinking Functionally With Haskell), though both are solid texts with a good backing in math (i.e. strong on the "equational reasoning" front EDIT: category theory is welcome too), and wanted to see if there was a consensus on either of them, or at least consolidate people's different opinions and experience between the two, especially from people who have read both. There hasn't the been most testimony comparing and contrasting the two as I've seen scouring this subreddit.
 I ask because I would rather not approach FP just as a programmer but in addition and moreso as a computer scientist instead (in the way SICP aims to teach CS book and is not simply a Scheme tutorial).
 Other books that have come on my radar (for this purpose) are: The Haskell Book (aka Haskell from First Principles) and Introduction to Computation: Haskell, Logic and Automata.
 That's about all, cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, beginner here. I understand that the $ function, for function application, essentially creates parentheses around the rest of the expression which follows it. Likewise, I understand that the (.) function, for function composition, composes two functions together. I am trying to better understand the behavior of these two functions in the context of them being combined in a single expression.
 Function 1 and its return value are below;
 ghci> zipWith max [1..5] [4..8] [4,5,6,7,8] 
 Now, we'll add the function print and the (.) function
 Function 2 doesn't function;
 ghci> print . zipWith max [1..5] [4..8] <interactive>:53:9: error: • Couldn't match expected type ‘a -> ()’ with actual type ‘[Integer]’ • Possible cause: ‘zipWith’ is applied to too many arguments In the second argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘zipWith max [1, 2, 3, 4, ....] [4, 5, 6, 7, ....]’ In the expression: print . zipWith max [1, 2, 3, 4, ....] [4, 5, 6, 7, ....] In an equation for ‘it’: it = print . zipWith max [1, 2, 3, ....] [4, 5, 6, ....] • Relevant bindings include it :: a -> IO () (bound at <interactive>:53:1) 
 * Note: I read this error message multiple times and am struggling to make sense of it.
 Now, we add the $ function between the two lists, and the function returns successfully.
 Function 3 and its return value are below;
 ghci> print . zipWith max [1..5] $ [4..8] [4,5,6,7,8] 
 I don't understand how the $ function affects function composition. Why is Function 1 fine, Function 3 fine, yet Function 2 produces an error?
 Thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, hope this message gets you well!
 I'm fairly new to emacs, but not to text editors. I use Neovim on day to day job and coding, but I do lack that feeling of IDEs where you can run the code without leaving the editor. And I think Emacs can help me with that (beside the OBVIOUS reason of org mode).
 I've seen some tutorials including the onde from DistroTube, System Crafters (if i'm not mistaken) and tried looking some documention (Of course all of it is nearly impossible in two weeks).
 But the feeling that prevails is overwhelmed by the possibilities. I know I can do ANYTHING in Emacs, but for now I want a good documentation resource with code (jupyter vibes).
 I know some things that I think I want, like magit, a fast LSP server, auto complete, syntax checking and efficient buffer management.
 Well, I know it is impossible to ask for this but what would you recommend to add to Emacs to make it look like an IDE but still keep room to grow any opinions are highly appreciated.
 P.S.: Is there a good resource to search for plugins based on user ratings or functions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm a beginner in using emacs (20++ years working in vim and recently nvim), for some time now I've been using org mode in emacs as a combination calendar/todo/notebook. I keep my files on a shared google drive, I've also connected it to org-mobile on my phone and generally it works ok, I'm quite happy with it.
 However, I recently read a book about building a second brain and decided to tidy up the system a bit. While writing or linking notes is not a problem, I probably don't understand the idea of ​​tags/properties or I have something set up wrong with the search. No matter how I set tags in my notes, I can't search for them. It looks a bit like the search only works in a few files that I have in my org-agenda-files(and even then not always) and nowhere else.
 I want to be able to search for topics, e.g. by tags in my entire "second brain" without adding them all to my agenda. I'm just afraid that soon I'll have dozens (hundreds?) of files and emacs will take half an hour to start. What's the best way to do it?
 P.S. I've been recently reading about org-roam , but I'm afraid it's a bit too complicated, especially since it requires a working database, which will severely limit file portability between platforms...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've started learning Haskell yesterday, going through the "blog generator" tutorial. This page instructs me to implement even and odd using mutual recursion and decrementing by one. I've came up with this and tried it inghci:
 even num = case num of 0 -> True; _ -> odd (num - 1)
 odd num = case num of 0 -> False; _ -> even (num - 1)
 This works as expected and e.g. odd 9 produces True.
 Then, just for the lulz, I triedodd (-9), expecting it to crash the interpreter. But, to my amazement, negative numbers also seem to work correctly and instantenously! What kind magic is this? Does it cause some kind of overflow that provides correct results by coincidence?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using the urxvt terminal with i3wm on Arch Linux. I recently installed emacs to try it out, when i tried to run emacs it kept exiting without even showing the default emacs screen and logging Undefined color: "[60]#141c21". I discovered this is the BG color i had set on ~/.Xresources ( the [60] stands for transparency out of 100 ). I should also point out I am using picom for the transparency.
 I tried changing the hex representation to an rgba one: rgba:0000/0000/0000/cccc. This also didn't work, i searched if there was any way to make emacs ignore the terminal colors, or overwrite them, but i didn't find a solution there. The only way emacs works now is if i supply -nw --color=no.
 Is there any way to not change my .Xresources and have emacs work even with different colors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After receiving some great feedback from the Neovim community on a comparison I made between Emacs and Neovim, and later also a bunch of encouragement words talking about this idea on both r/neovim and r/emacs, I've been inspired to create something new*:
 Emacs-Kick — a lightweight, beginner-friendly Emacs configuration inspired by kickstart.nvim
  
Github: https://github.com/LionyxML/emacs-kick
  
https://preview.redd.it/kg1oei01artd1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ad6022340c96739e2bb79a24dcb1979a4657a60
 What Makes Emacs-Kick Special?
 While there are many Emacs kickstarter configs out there, Emacs-Kick is focused on providing a simple and accessible setup for Neovim users who are curious about Emacs, without asking them to fully dive into the Emacs way of doing things.
 Key Features:
  
Terminal-first: No need for a GUI. Works seamlessly with tmux, zellij, lazygit, starship, and other terminal tools.
 Vim bindings by default: For a smooth transition from Neovim.
 Pre-configured Treesitter and LSP: Get up and running quickly with modern code features.
 Simple defaults inspired by kickstart.nvim: Familiar setup to help ease the learning curve.
  
The goal of Emacs-Kick is not to replace Neovim but to act as a secondary tool that you can experiment with. Whether you're interested in trying out Emacs' unique features or just want to see what all the fuss is about, Emacs-Kick makes it easy to explore without being overwhelmed by complex setups like Doom or Spacemacs.
 I’m excited to share it with the community—feel free to try it out and reach out with any feedback or questions on GitHub. Let’s build something great together!

 Here is the message:
  
Hi I’m partnering with a global consultancy to build Apple’s new Scala team in Malmö, and we’re on the hunt for top talent to join this incredible journey! with a potential 5 year contract. If you're ready to work on ground breaking projects with one of the world's most iconic tech giants, I’d love to tell you more. Drop me your phone number and availability, and let’s chat! This could be your next big move!
  
It feels a bit like a scam, or at least like a dishonest approach, for instance if they have a retention problem on their Scala team and are hiring people to support their legacy.
 What do you think?

 It's a common enough situation. I have a feature branch with many commits, and master has a few commits past the branch point. I desired to squash the commits and rebase my feature onto the current tip of master to stay updated.
 Here's what I did:
  
I switched to master, and made sure to pull the local branch to the tip.
 
I switched to my working branch, and made sure the origin was pushed and up to date with the current commit level, and stashed the current modified files.
 I performed a rebase onto branch with r b and selected the local master branch.
 I rewrote the commit for the first commit of the series and squashed the rest.

 When I set tags for some kind of topics grouping, I am fine using the completion mini buffer, I still have too many tags to make a letter selection paractical. It also depends a lot on the context; mostly, am I tagging tasks or general notes, the former having far fewer 'topic' tags.
 I have however a few tags that I use for maintenance purposes, or status indication like 'DRAFT', 'WIP', 'REFILE', etc... In those cases, the fast selection interface combined for mutually exclusive group tags is exactly what I need.
 I would rather not set the `TAGS` keyword in all of my files (I also use `org-roam` so I have a lot !), and I am trying to simply keep my settings as is…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love ido mode but I have one frustration with it. If I want to create a new file and the file name resembles an existing buffer I’m always switched to that buffer. I know why this happens, but as a web developer in svelte, this can be frustrating since many files are named for instance “+page.svelte” , and the only difference is the file path. So, I’ll dired my way to a path and try to create a new file right there, and instead jump over to an existing buffer elsewhere and totally not have created the new file I want.
 Anybody got suggestions on how I can force create a new file buffer right where I just navigated to with dired ,even if the buffer name matches some other buffer?
 My lame workaround is to create a weird name like xyzzyzzyzy.svelte , write or paste some code in it, save, c-x d to the dired, hit r to reload the directory list, and then rename the file to what I actually want. Pretty tedious.
 All ideas welcomed!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently someone asked about filling (aka wrapping) text within columns. It's a useful feature, so I added it to the simple package speedrect, which implements a little modal interface that comes alive during rectangle-selection mode.
 Just highlight a rectangular region of text (C-M-mouse-1 works great, or C-x SPACE then move), and hit f to wrap. The wrap width defaults to the rectangle's width (e.g. to expand an existing wrapped block). Otherwise, use a numeric prefix (e.g. M-20 f) or regular prefix (C-u f) to prompt for the width. The selected rectangle's height sets the height of the safe fill region (usually extending down to the next distinct "row" of data). If the newly filled text exceeds this height, additional lines are added below.
 speedrect has lots of other useful features for moving rectangles around, operating on them, and sending them back and forth to calc. To use it, just select a rectangle...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are working on a project and need to both create SVGs and read our created SVGs (or also user supplied SVGs, but we can specify which SVG elemtns are allowed).
 When reading svgs we need to know which shapes are contained in the svgs (only circles and rectangles are relevant for us). If there are shapes using the svg <rect>, <circle>/<ellipse> in the file this would certainly make life easier for reading the svg.
 Mainly based on another post https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/tlvopj/looking_for_svg_library_recommendations/ I've found the following libraries that supports both reading and writing:
  
svg-tree: Features both reading and writing. But reading and writing seems to not be super easy but I was able to accomplish both things as a POC. Also the documentation is almost non existent. For an easier to use writing interface I imagine that we could also use lucid-svg.
 
diagrams with diagrams-svg and diagrams-input: Features both reading and writing. The writing api is amazing and really well documented! And I was able to read an svg file created by the library into a Diagrams type. But I was not able to find a way how I can find out what shapes are contained in this Diagram (what circles and rectangles are there in the file?). It doesn't seem to be easily possible, as it just saves Paths in the types and also in the file? But maybe I'm wrong. Unfortunately combining the writing API of diagrams and using the svg-tree library to parse them also doesn't seem to be easily possible, as again, only paths are saved in the file.
 
 Does someone know whether this is possible using diagrams? Or does someone have any suggestions on a different library we could use to read or write an svg? (e.g. a better writing interface that will work together with svg-tree)
 Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

 elpaca is complaining about not being able to find js-mode and, agreed, I don't see it on MELPA etc. I suspect perhaps something, for my version of emacs, has replaced js-mode? Or maybe for all versions of Emacs since the deno docs were written?
 Thoughts?

 EDIT: LLMs say js2-mode has replaced js-mode however I'm seeing conflicting reports on that in this sub and elsewhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m aware that Python is hugely popular in the data engineering space, but I believe that this might be more due to its popularity than its actual advantages over other languages. Scala, in my opinion, has features that, if leveraged properly, can outperform Python in certain areas.
 I’m curious if anyone in our community here is using Scala exclusively for data engineering without relying on Python at all. I’ve been a full-stack software engineer working in Scala for over five years, and I’m considering transitioning to data engineering. Should I invest time in learning Python, or is focusing solely on Scala a viable option in this field? Would it be better to spend that time deepening my Scala skills in more advanced areas instead?

 That produces this TeX file:

 How do I disable the auto-centering? The only options on the manual page are to enable it
  
  
The answer was to set org-latex-tables-centered to nil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wonderful folks of this sub-reddit, 
 I have decided to rebuild my emacs config (switching from Doom) and I am using the emacs-frosted from Homebrew. I have installed emacs@plus-30 (with native-comp) and while trying to run my initial run a lot of the packages are failing to build - and the error I get is 'error invoking gcc driver'. 
 I am not at all a technical person but from a bit of googling around I understand this mainly has to do with setting the path from where Emacs calls this library. Apart from fixing this problem I would like to learn about this as well, so I have two questions -
  
I have gcc installed from Homebrew. It is situated in a bin folder under the cellar directory. I have two versions (14.1.0_2, 14.2.0). I have added the snippet below in my early-init -  (setenv "LIBRARY_PATH" "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/14.2.0/bin")  However this not solve my issue. 
 Do I need to do this in my earl-init, or can I just add this in my zhrsc profile? I do not understand whats the difference between both. 
  
PS - Yes, I have exec-from-shell package installed and I've added use-package in my init file.
 EDIT - Yes, I'm on Sequoia
 EDIT 2 - SOLVED - https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/733

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I randomly decided to start learning Haskell (and FP) a few days ago and actually really enjoyed it. Some concepts were definitely a bit hard to grasp at first, but after figuring them out, I was almost instantly able to see how using said concept could be more beneficial than an imperative approach. That being said, I was somewhat disappointed when I learned that Haskell is considered to be "niche" in the software industry and that there aren't as many jobs for it as there are for other FP langs like Scala (and of course Java), but there are certainly still a few. 
 For the minority of Haskell programmers who do it for a living, what exactly do you program? Do you prefer doing your work in Haskell as opposed to another FP language (e.g. Scala, Elixir, OCaml, Clojure...) as well as imperative languages (e.g. Python, Java, C#...)?

 I found this nice article detailing some useful commands such as keep-lines and flush-lines which are built-in.
 However, I would like to pretty print the logs first using the json-pretty-print-buffer command, and then run keep-lines to say, keep only logs that have the level field set to error.
 This doesn't really work because it only matches the line itself (of course); it is not aware that is inside a JSON object, thus the rest of the JSON object is hidden.
 Is there a better way of doing this?
 And also, how do you usually trek through logs in Emacs?
 I really like lnav and being able to easily enable filters. It seems that keep-lines stacks, but there doesn't seem to be an easy way to toggle filters?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 The Cask micro-framework is my go-to building block for REST services. It hits the productive, approachable sweet-spot for what scala could and should be IMHO.
 I’m also a fan of contract-first development for REST services, and noticed cask was missing as an option, so I took the liberty of providing one and wrote about it here.
 Beyond cask, I took the liberty of addressing a number of other issues I’ve found lacking in the other offerings: 
  
being able to just jar-up my generated code
 offer an easy example for bootstrapping my project
 have the generated code target both JVM and ScalaJS
 correctly implement validation, ‘additionalProperties’, and other open-api features
  
Anyway, it’s currently available, though perhaps alpha-quality (so comments / bug reports / contributors welcome)
 A big thank-you too to William Cheng and the wonderful maintainers of the openapi templates, and of course Li Haoyi for his excellent “Singapore stack” :-)

 As a writer with a severe case of ADHD I sometimes need the temptation of distraction. I am perfectly aware that it is not really possible to completely lock up Linux or Emacs, but just making it a bit harder to lose focus is often enough. So a simple function that made it so that I can't leave the file I'm working at for the time being would be quite helpful.
 ALSO...
 If you feel compelled to say "just make an effort instead", please don't. Looking for ways to make my environment and tools less distracting is effort. 
 I'm glad you have good self control. I don't. So keep this to yourself.

The promise of the Zettelkasten method is that it will allow you to create an artificial writing partner that will surprise you with new ideas and help you write high-quality texts.
However, the typical situation for inexperienced spectators is to be disappointed when they visit someone else's Zettelkasten; they cannot see how a Zettelkasten lives up to its promise, and they cannot see the ghost in the box.
The underlying problem is that if you don't understand the true nature of a Zettelkasten, you won't be able to see the ghost in the box.
So, what is the true nature of a Zettelkasten? A Zettelkasten is a thinking environment. The ghost does not hide inside the box; it hides in the private mental process of a user interacting with his Zettelkasten.

 I just upgraded my emacs, now I am using this org-mode version:
 Org mode version 9.7.11 
 But I am getting this nasty error:
 {lisp} Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Tab width in Org files must be 8, not 4. Please adjust your ‘tab-width’ settings for Org mode") error("Tab width in Org files must be 8, not %d.

 The Org release notes suggest to run this in existing org files:
 {lisp} (defun org-compat-adjust-tab-width-in-buffer (old-width) "Adjust visual indentation from `tab-width' equal OLD-WIDTH to 8." (interactive "nOld `tab-width': ") (cl-assert (derived-mode-p 'org-mode)) (unless (= old-width 8) (org-with-wide-buffer (goto-char (point-min)) (let (bound (repl (if (< old-width 8) (make-string old-width ?\s) (concat "\t" (make-string (- old-width 8) ?\s))))) (while (re-search-forward "^ *\t" nil t) (skip-chars-forward " \t") (setq bound (point-marker)) (forward-line 0) (while (search-forward "\t" bound t) (replace-match repl))))))) 
 But I am doing it, and (1) nothing changes when I run that code, (2) the error persists.
 What should I do?
 Thanks in advance

 SPIN syntax is similar to Pascal, but it uses indentation instead of BEGIN/END blocks. Single line comments start with a single quote ("'") and are not ended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm at a company which has a cult like behaviour towards Haskell. I'm fairly decent in Haskell but don't really mind using other languages. I understand that Haskell is a great language but the way my colleagues talk about Java or Python seems to be slightly fanatical. They keep harping on about how amazing Haskell is and how crap oop is. These are senior engineers and the way they are so opinionated makes me wary. From my POV, I think OOP or imperative languages are used in like 95% of all software which means they surely have something going for them because at the end of the day only the ones that make money matters.
 I think both have their usecases in different places but it's just uncomfortable to be in an office that craps on OOP all the time with no effort on being at least slightly objective. How do I keep my sanity while working here or are they correct with their views?

 I get this in my minibuffer on invoking eglot-format-buffer
  eglot--error: [eglot] Unsupported or ignored LSP capability :documentFormattingProvider' 
 I found a (possibly) related neovim issue here
 Can someone help me fix this? Thanks!

I'm aware how much more popular latex is in academic community, so it's no surprise that out of the box export looks like an academic paper. However, my attempts to make it look more like an office document failed. A lot of basic features of org mode like tables or indentation are just not there out of the box.
 Does anyone have any ready made templates that I could just include and they would "just work"?
 Here is my current setup:
 headers.tex included at the top of the document: https://pastebin.com/9nYe45bP
 headers in org-mode documents:
 #+LATEX_HEADER: \input{/home/<USER>/latex/headers.tex} #+OPTIONS: \n:t #+OPTIONS: H:6 #+OPTIONS: toc:nil #+LATEX_COMPILER: xelatex

Do you think configuring emacs for this is worth the learning and time or stick to cherrytree for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Aider
 Aider is an AI pair programming tool in the terminal. It allows you to pair program with large language models (LLMs) to edit code in your local Git repository. You can start a new project or work with an existing Git repo. Aider works best with GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet and can connect to almost any LLM. The GitHub page for Aider is GitHub - Aider-AI/aider: aider is AI pair programming in your terminal, and the project currently has nearly 20k stars.
 Aider has performed well in solving real coding problems on SWE-bench.
 Introducing Aider.el
 Recently, the Cursor editor has been gaining popularity. As a long-time Emacs user, I don't want to switch to Cursor just because of AI. Currently, Aider only has plugins for Vim and VSCode, but Emacs has a tradition of integrating command-line tools. So I decided to write my own, as a humble attempt: GitHub - tninja/aider.el: aider emacs plugin forhttps://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider.
 This plugin offers the following advantages over using Aider directly from the command line:
  
Pop-up menu: No need to remember commands. (aider-transient-menu)
 Git repository-specific Aider sessions in Emacs: It automatically identifies the Git repository of the current file and creates a new Aider session for it. Multiple Aider sessions can exist for different Git repositories, allowing you to work on several repositories simultaneously without interference.
 Region-based refactor support: You can select a region (e.g., a code block) in a file and ask Aider to refactor it.
  
In fact, most of this plugin itself was generated using Aider / aider.el.
 If you're interested in AI-assisted programming and, like me, prefer not to leave the Emacs environment, perhaps you could give Aider and aider.el a try. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you have about aider.el. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me paint a picture for you all: I do some technical writing using org-mode (mostly papers on computer science), but I must confess I got a terrible spelling, both in my mother tongue and English, so spell checking is a must to everything I do. 
 I used to use flyspell + enchant, but it would cause severe lag (I tend to write hole documents in one file), so I have changed to jinx, and it's amazing in terms of performance. One thing I think I could upgrade in my workflow, is that the suggestions are too far off the real word I mean, even thought the error is somewhat minor, most of the words I don't even know existed! 
 On the other hand, I also have ltex installed, and its suggestions are 99% of the time on point, but it comes at the cost of only updating when I save the buffer and being somewhat slow. So to do a final pass is great, but to spell check while writing is impossible.
 One other thing I have seen in the past but never got my head around doing was using dabbrev to fix recurring mistakes, but I don't think this would solve the problem. Another (crazy) idea is to use some small LLM to better predict the word based on context, but if LanguageTool can do it without it (I think), is there any other way?
 So, anyone have tackled those difficulties? I am accepting any tips or tricks you all have!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently made this post describing a weird issue I have where Emacs frames are being automatically deleted.
  
 I followed u/mocam6o suggestion of using the following hook
 (add-hook 'delete-frame-functions (lambda (_) (backtrace))) 
 and after a while I managed to catch Emacs in the act of killing frames. Here is an example backtrace:
 backtrace() (lambda (_) (backtrace))(#<frame 2024-09-24.org 0x557eff7ebea8>) run-hook-with-args((lambda (_) (backtrace)) #<frame 2024-09-24.org 0x557eff7ebea8>) delete-frame() funcall-interactively(delete-frame) repeat(nil) funcall-interactively(repeat nil) call-interactively(repeat) #f(compiled-function () (interactive nil) #<bytecode 0x18c68b2c1f240275>)() funcall-interactively(#f(compiled-function () (interactive nil) #<bytecode 0x18c68b2c1f240275>)) command-execute(#f(compiled-function () (interactive nil) #<bytecode 0x18c68b2c1f240275>)) 
  
 By contrast, when I manually kill a frame (containing just a window with the *scratch* buffer), the backtrace is:
 backtrace() (lambda (_) (backtrace))(#<frame *scratch* 0x557f0457dda8>) run-hook-with-args((lambda (_) (backtrace)) #<frame *scratch* 0x557f0457dda8>) delete-frame() funcall-interactively(delete-frame) 
  
 The cause of the automatic deletion seems to be a compiled-function, and looking at other backtraces, the function seems to be associated with #<bytecode 0x18c68b2c1f240275>.
  
 How do I find out the name or source of this compiled function, or work out how it's being called? (I'm not sure if it's possible to find the source name of compiled code ...)

 But I am having a hard time using metals with methods suggestions or definitions support.
 For more info
 I am using scala 3.3.3, Play 2 +, Java 11, SBT 1.10
 Metals is updated as well 
 When I try to look at metals logs I don't see any issue whatsoever which I can understand. From Doctor it gives yellow icon at semantic DB, also I am not able to find semantic db files through command (metals: semantic db file in vs code) 
 Mostly I am having those issues with any file that is doing anything with slick DB, for slick I am using play-slick 6.1
 which uses slick 3.5._ which is compatible with scala 3
 Please help, am I making any mistake or is it a metals problem!
 Also, in IntelliJ things are working well! But I can't use IntelliJ in WSL (IntelliJ takes 10 gigs of ram alone in WSL) 
 https://reddit.com/link/1fwlnfc/video/lzx7pbkocwsd1/player
 I am attaching a video to demonstrate what I am facing !
 I want to have methods definition at least after typing '.' . 
 Another thing I want to point is that Compilation is working perfectly, see the red underlines that comes and go! But it is the definitions and autosuggestions that metals is not picking up !
 HELP !!

 I guess whats happening after reading around is that the customize GUI is injecting some settings into my init.el file?
 It was my understanding that the init.el isn't 'connected' to the GUI customize interface.
 I've added the following to the top of my init.el file for now to keep the settings that I can't seem to control in another file. But I can't help but think I don't understand something or am doing something wrong....
 (setq custom-file "~/.config/emacs/custom.el")
 (load custom-file)
 My question(s):
 When making your own configuration is it the Customize GUI, init.el, or both being used in conjunction with one another? Does it matter or should I be disabling the GUI interface?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know many people who use Emacs map CapsLock to Ctrl to avoid “Emacs pinky” and many vim/nvim users map it to esc since esc, the most used key in Vim, is far away from home row.
 So it seems the best solution would be to do a system-wide remapping to let CapsLock trigger esc when tapped and Ctrl when hold down (this can be achieved by keyd program on Linux and karabina elements on macOS). While this works, I found it to accidentally trigger esc frequently when I try to do movement or C-g in Emacs, which is annoying.
 I’m wondering if there is a better solution. I was thinking of disabling esc completely in Emacs (not sure if it’s achievable via .emacs file) as I’ve never used it but it seems like the esc key has its own use in Emacs.
 I’d love to know if anyone had a different workflow. I’d like to stop using keyd program as it seems to have issues with key repeat on my machine. By the way I use vanilla Emacs and have no intention to use evil mode. Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, folks, new to Haskell. I find that I learn best by mucking up code - get some code to work, then try to refactor it to see it in a new light. Stuck on this gem and hope to get some insight from you all:
 Context: I'm working towards a text adventure app where you put the name of the adventure in as a command line argument: `LaunchAdventure --adventure myAdventure:`.
 This works:
 -- #1 greet :: AdventureOptions -> IO () greet (AdventureOptions a ) = putStrLn $ "You chose: '" ++ a ++ "'." main :: IO () main = (greet =<< parse) >> putStrLn "And just for testing" 
 Where parse is of type parse :: IO AdventureOptions (I'm using the optparse-applicative package as part of this experiment).
 What I want to do is to see if I can get rid of thegreet function completely. I've cobbled a few attempts together like these:
 -- #2 main = \a -> putStrLn $ "You chose: '" ++ a ++ "'." =<< parse -- or this messy attempt: -- #3 main = \a -> parse >>= putStrLn $ "You chose: '" ++ (a :: AdventureOptions) ++ "'." 
 But I keep running into errors like "Couldn't match expected type ‘[Char]’ with actual type ‘AdventureOptions’" (with regards to a) or worse. I get what the error is saying; what I can't figure out is how to solve it inline.
 The working greet example (#1) has the function declaration of greet :: AdventureOptions -> IO () so I gather that that is how the compiler is inferring things there. How does one indicate that type in an inline fashion?
 Is "casting" a to AdventureOptions a possibility in some way? I know I've seen documentation regarding in-line type syntax, but can't find a solid example that is applicable here. And is a lambda even the right thing to attempt here at all?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there! 👋
 After receiving some encouraging feedback from the Neovim community on a recent comparison I made between Emacs and Neovim (here), I’ve been inspired to create something new (new for me):
 Emacs-Kicks — a lightweight Emacs configuration inspired by kickstart.nvim.
 What sets this project apart from the many existing kickstart packages for Emacs? The main focus is to offer a simple, Neovim-user friendly setup for those who are curious about Emacs, without asking them to fully transition or embrace the entire "Emacs way" of doing things.
 Some key features:
  
No need for GUI, making it tmux, zellij, lazygit, starship, and terminal tool friendly
 Vim bindings as default
 Treesitter and LSP pre-configured
 Simple defaults based on kickstart.nvim for familiarity
  
The idea is for Emacs to act as a secondary tool, not as a replacement for Neovim, so users can experiment and explore Emacs without feeling overwhelmed by setups like Doom or Spacemacs.
 The project is almost ready, and I’d love to get feedback from the Emacs community. This could also be a helpful entry point for Neovim users who want to dip their toes into Emacs without too much complexity.
 If anyone would be interested in testing it or offering feedback, I’d love to hear your thoughts!
 Wish me luck over at r/neovim 😊

 I've had a disappointing day... I restarted my MacBook Pro this morning as an update required it. There's me thinking "what could go wrong, all MY stuff is in Emacs" (side note, it's not, I'm working towards it). Once the machine came back up, I have this weird issue where Emacs works, sort of. I can't seem to open any org documents running Emacs in GUI mode, I just get the spinning beach ball and the machine locks up. I have to wait to force close Emacs before I regain control. I don't use Emacs in the terminal (because I have the GUI and love it), however I have no issues with opening/editing/reading org files through emacs in terminal.
 I am wondering, has any one come across this issue today/in the past? Am I missing something (is there some manual I didn't read - if you point it out and it's obvious I'm happy to look stupid for a little while, but please show me the answer)? Also, if there's a load of "I have no idea what you did" then are there others out there to simply share in this misery (I had such a lovely set up, still got it, but this blemish (I hope it's a blemish) is busting ma danglies.
 And if you just stopped by to read this guy crying in to the inter webs: Hi, I use Emacs (almost badly?) btw, nice to meet you - and you should really use Emacs hopefully it won't slap you in the fan-dangles like it has me today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doing academic research, I often have cases where I want to reference, for example, a specific chapter from a book (like collective works, or collected essays from one author). I create these as individual items in my library (exported as bibtex by Zotero/better bibtex but I don't think that is important). I would like to be able to keep the notes for these chapters connected to the source book, but I can't figure out how to get citar-open-notes to recognise this. Calling citar-open-notes for a new library item creates a new org file with the appropirate metadata (including roam-refs) and the citekey as the filename; this is fine default behaviour, but I'd like it to first check if the citekey already exists as a roam_refs property in another file before creating a new one.
 Can I get it to do this somehow? Thanks!

 I'm new in the scala world and i try to expose my swagger config from a scala api.
 Everything is working fine with finatra swagger.
 But one of my endpoint response is a case class with a property of type trait.
 With this response i will have my response correctly exported in definition but the CodedErrorContract trait will not be exported so i cannot generate client because of a missing object.
 Do you have an idea how to solve that with keeping my trait in the response.
 I know i could refactor my model to use class instead of a trait but i would try to avoid that solution.
 Thanks for your help

 const def_vs =/*glsl*/`#version 300 es precision mediump float; in vec3 position; in vec2 texcoord; in vec3 color; out vec2 vtex; out vec3 vcolor; void main() { vcolor = color; vtex = texcoord; gl_Position = vec4(position, 1); } `; 
 I was wondering if anyone here has used the packages polymode or MMM-mode for this type of purpose, where the file his highlited in one mode, but tagged strings are highlighted in another? Is either package better, or does anyone have usage tips? thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve released library that helps to build web applications. It is situated between scotty and servant, avoiding complex types (where possible), while at the same time providing a typed interface and introspection capabilities.
 Here is “hello, world” using Minion. More can be found at Hackage (Web.Minion.Examples.*) and Github
 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedLists #-} module Main where import Web.Minion import Network.Wai.Handler.Warp qualified as Warp main :: IO () main = Warp.run 9001 app app :: ApplicationM IO app = serve api api :: Router Void IO api = "api" /> [ "about" /> handlePlainText u/String GET about , "hello" /> capture u/String "name" .> handlePlainText u/String GET hello ] where about = pure "Hello-World Minion server" hello name = pure $ "Hello, " <> name <> "!" 
 I assume that the library currently has some bugs and may have an inconvenient interface and not very detailed documentation. But I hope to solve these problems with the help of the community. Try it out in your projects, send bug reports, thank you.

 Now that I get back to develop in Python. My Python code is very functional.
 The latest versions of Python allow structural pattern matching which is quite good.
 There are also some minimalist FP libraries. Some are more evolved. 
 I think Python isn't such a bad candidate for some kind of FP lite.
 Obviously the lack tailrec recursion is problematic for FP.
 But not such a bad language to implement basic FP.
 Obviously it will depend on your definition of FP. 
 Do you implement some kind of FP in Python? Do you use any FP libraries?

 Anybody have advice as to the happy path on how to tangle up some plain-text / configuration files (for Literate DevOps)?
 I'd like to avoid a HEREDOC in a sh|shell|bash language block because that doesn't lend itself to great syntax coloring. These tangles are as often InSpec code as they are plain-text. (No, the org-babel Ruby language support doesn't like InSpec.)
 thx
 EDIT:
 - GNU Emacs 29.4 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.41, cairo version 1.18.0)
 - Org: Org mode version 9.6.15 (release_9.6.15 @ /gnu/store/ajigj8zcm0zxnbvk91148j9zkhxy3wc6-emacs-29.4/share/emacs/29.4/lisp/org/)
 EDIT: 
 It's not a perfect solution but since neither 'conf' nor 'text' seems to work, I am able to use 'org' to get what I want via an oddly indirect route:
 #+begin_src org :tangle /tmp/bash.rb describe os.family do it { should eq 'debian' } end #+end_src

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I have some simple org-babel code which I have reduced to a test case as follows
 # -*- mode:org ; eval:(visual-line-mode t) -*- #+name ruby-double #+begin_src ruby :var x=2 puts x*2 #+end_src #+RESULTS: : 4 #+name: double #+begin_src emacs-lisp :var x=2 (* 2 x) #+end_src #+RESULTS: double : 4 #+CALL: double(x=4) #+RESULTS: : 8 #+CALL: ruby-double(x=4) 
 Starting at the top I can run ruby-double on its own, double on its own, and the call to double with x=4 by executing C-c C-c in the right place. 
 However when I try this on the call to ruby-double this line is not being recognized as code (because I get no code execution prompt) and I get no output and no error message in the minibuffer or in the *messages* buffer.
 The sequence gives the following in *messages*
 Evaluate this ruby code block on your system? (y or n) y Executing Ruby code block at position 68... Wrote /var/folders/50/9y75bf_x77q9fpz7rr32ykx40000gn/T/babel-ESjvl7/ob-input-LVBC7N Code block evaluation complete (took 0.1s). Evaluate this emacs-lisp code block (double) on your system? (y or n) y Executing Emacs-Lisp code block (double)... Code block evaluation complete. Evaluate this emacs-lisp code block on your system? (y or n) y Executing Emacs-Lisp call at position 219... Code block evaluation complete. 
 I seem to be missing a setting to allow ruby to be used in the #+CALL construct but I have been unable to find it anywhere.
 Does someone have a pointer to the cause of this, or possible, how to debug it.

 Hi everyone. I decided to give emacs a go and coming from vim, doom sounded like a good idea. I'm encountering a strange issue though. I'm getting two different lists of completions and the one in the background is focused. The only package I have turned on appears to be company. Has anyone else experienced and resolved this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think most of you have seen the article Fifteen ways to use Embark, and one of my favorites is 
 `` (eval-when-compile (defmacro my/embark-ace-action (fn) (defun ,(intern (concat "my/embark-ace-" (symbol-name fn))) () (interactive) (with-demoted-errors "%s" (require 'ace-window) (let ((aw-dispatch-always t)) (aw-switch-to-window (aw-select nil)) (call-interactively (symbol-function ',fn)))))))
 (define-key embark-file-map (kbd "o") (my/embark-ace-action find-file)) (define-key embark-buffer-map (kbd "o") (my/embark-ace-action switch-to-buffer)) (define-key embark-bookmark-map (kbd "o") (my/embark-ace-action bookmark-jump)) ```
 which allows me to:
  
Run consult-buffer and select the buffer I want spawned
 Run embark-act, press o
 Have ace-window show up, where I can select where I want the buffer to be spawned
  
However, I am puzzled by how I can do the same with consult-grep. 
 I've tried:
  (use-package embark-consult :ensure t :hook (embark-collect-mode . consult-preview-at-point-mode) :config (define-key embark-consult-search-map (kbd "w") (my/embark-ace-action embark-export))) 
 but 
  
This wouldn't work anyway, as embark-export spawns its own buffer; the way that my/embark-ace-action is set up is that it spawns ace-window to switch to the buffer we want (e.g. by creating a split), and then running the command (in this case this would be embark-export)
 For some reason I get dired opened instead of the grep results?
  
Any pointers on how I can accomplish this?
 I see there's a variable embark-targets or something like that, which stores the results. Is there a way to render the grep results in the same buffer instead of spawning a new one?
 Thanks

 In other words, a kind of (fill-paragraph) that operates only within two columns (in this case columns 40-75), or alternatively, within a rectangular region. But in any case leaving the rest of the text unchanged.

 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

 I'm trying to add a refile target where title is not a URL. So I added the following line to my configuration:
 (setq org-refile-targets `(("some-refile.org" :regexp . ,(rx bol (+ "*") " " (not "["))))) 
 Everything is good so far, but when I do a org-refile I expect file names to be in the following format: header (file-name.org) and that is the case for other targets where I use :maxlevel but for the target that I use :regexp file name is missing, and it is displayed in following format heading...
 I don't know if this is the expected behavior or not, so I thought I might just ask...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been wondering about the proportion of people who use effect systems (cats-effect, zio, etc...) compared to those who use standard Scala (the Martin Odersky way). 
 I was surprised when I saw this post:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/lfbjcf/does_anyone_here_intentionally_use_scala_without/
 A lot of people are not using effect system in their jobs it seems.
 For sure the trend in the Scala community is pure FP, hence effect systems.
 I understand it can be the differentiation point over Kotlin to have true FP, I mean in a more Haskell way.
 Don't get me wrong I think standard Scala is 100% true FP. 
 That said, when I look for Scala job offers (for instance from https://scalajobs.com), almost all job posts ask for cats, cats-effect or zio.
 I'm not sure how common are effect systems in the real world.
 What do you guys think?

 I have configured re-builder to use 'string mode.
  (require 're-builder) (setq reb-re-syntax 'string) 
 In re-builder, after I finished with my regex, e.g. \(lambda\) (), I use C-c C-w to copy the regexp. But I noticed a message saying the copied regex is \\(lambda\\) (). The \ is escaped, which makes the regex useless in other places in emacs.
 According to https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/re-builder-interactive-regexp-builder, in 'string mode, the output of the re-builder is supposed to be used for other regex search input.
 I wonder what I missed or messed up in my emacs configuration, or I just missed some key stroke.

One, it returns one or more rows, Two, it returns 0 rows Three, it crashes due to a database error
 In FP world, we ideally wrap SQL statements with Try, but how to handle 3 possibilities ? Should I create a monad with 3 possible states, or use Try[Option] to wrap the ResultSet, or just follow plain java and throw the exception in the DAO layer itself ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There has been big lag in my python eglot buffer. The behaviour is kind of like the one where emacs takes seconds to do GC - emacs freezes and you input appears after the freeze(or if you are moving around, cursor jumped to the direction), only that emacs is not doing GC. (I turned on gcmh-verbose, which prints gc message if you have gcmh-mode enabled, to check)
 I run profiler just now and out of 3 runs one of them have 80% CPU time on eldoc. Other 2 0%. I disabled eldoc-mode and suddenly it is as smooth as fundamental-mode.
 It is wierd that it didn't appear on other 2 profiler runs. So if you have eglot lag issue you can try this. I have the following doomemacs keymap to help quickly toggle eldoc-mode
  (map! :map doom-leader-map "t e" #'eldoc-mode )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
As someone with ADHD, the idea of a system that can organize a maelstrom of ideas into something retrievable is irresistible. (I imagine many can relate.) But every attempt, over decades, from pen and paper to Obsidian to Notion, has ended in a mess that becomes unusable. Once the system gets bloated, I start over with the best intentions, trying to keep things simple. I've lost countless hours in this cycle and hope to figure out where I'm going wrong before I start again.
I have thousands of ideas, thoughts, journal entries, research, etc.
I have various ways to jot things down quickly, but if I don't categorize them, I know I’ll never look at them again, especially long journal entries. I used to record notes, which are automatically transcribed, but now I have hundreds or even thousands of transcriptions that are effectively meaningless. I don’t know what I’ll do with them, so they just pile up, collecting, not connecting.
If I try to organize them, that creates friction, and after a valiant effort, things get out of hand. There are too many notes and too many ways to link them, and many are just the same idea phrased differently.
Even with proper linkages, at some point, 200 notes on a topic become clutter, and there’s no way to distill it when I need it.
Sometimes I feel like all this effort to manually do what my brain cannot is futile. If I’m writing something and want to reference a topic, I get overwhelmed by too much information.
Should I stop trying, or is there a method that can help someone like me?
I was excited about AI in Obsidian or Notion, but the results were inaccurate or incomplete (e.g., “show me all my notes on a topic” or “how many notes do I have?” give partial results). Maybe I didn’t set it up correctly, but figuring it out was too overwhelming.
Best,
R]]></summary>

 I'm still learning my way figuring out what breaks syntax. If you look at the snippet below, `Try` has to be on its line. `: db =>` has to end the line. `toEither` is inline with `result`.
 I saw a recent Odersky quote where he says we should all move to braceless syntax, but I can't help but feel it's not quite there yet. I have to adjust my whitespace and newlines more often than expected such that it breaks my flow.
 Typically, in Go or Typescript, I can write super messy code, then a fmt command aligns every for me.

 [reddit comment](Some searching indicates it may have arrived in Emacs 29 - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/122hw51/how_to_make_customthemesetfaces_work_i_used_it_to/jfzqi75/.)
 I am still on 28
 Mastering Emacs
  
New hooks 'enable-theme-functions' and 'disable-theme-functions'. These are run after enabling and disabling a theme, respectively.
  
 I want to try out some new themes but need to ensure that some of my org-todo-keyword-faces settings and a whole load of other faces are compatible with them?
 Questions like suggest there is a _pent-up_demand for such a feature:
 Does emacs have a hook for when the theme changes?
 Is there a universal 'after-theme-load' hook?
 This manual page A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading suggests something like that may be in the offing and it seems Modus themes come with such a function.
 It is Prot's EF themes I want to try out so they might include such a hook.
 PS. Isn't the hook example there the kind being deprecated?

 to
 https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds/releases/tag/Emacs-29.4 https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds
 The performance of the latter has been excellent and it's not just Andrea Corallo's magic native jit (unsupported in the caldwell builds). The misbehaviors I was experiencing/suffering from of the former do not seem apparent. This is despite ostensibly sharing the same GNU Emacs code base (independent of patches Jim applies which seem unrelated to my issues).
 For anyone suffering from Emacs performance issues or issues that appear to be bugs, I recommend giving Jim Myhrberg's aka u/jimehgeek builds a try. Up next: Emacs 30 testing and ARM.
 Many thanks to both David and Jim for supporting the Emacs community with their Mac builds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often have to insert special characters into a buffer and I find the default emacs bindings unconvenient and hard to remeber. Thus, I created this function in my init.el which offers an easier way to select a accented character to insert:
 ``` emacs-lisp (defun accented () (interactive) (let ((char-option (completing-read "-> " '("A" "E" "I" "O" "U" "C" "N" "S"))))
 (let ((my-char-list (cond ((string= char-option "A") '("á" "Á" "à" "À" "â" "Â" "ä" "Ä" "ã" "Ã" "å" "Å" "æ" "Æ")) ((string= char-option "E") '("é" "É" "è" "È" "ê" "Ê" "ë" "Ë")) ((string= char-option "I") '("í" "Í" "ì" "Ì" "î" "Î" "ï" "Ï")) ((string= char-option "O") '("ó" "Ó" "ò" "Ò" "ô" "Ô" "ö" "Ö" "õ" "Õ" "ø" "Ø" "œ" "Œ")) ((string= char-option "U") '("ü" "Ü" "ù" "Ù" "ú" "Ú" "û" "Û")) ((string= char-option "C") '("ç" "Ç")) ((string= char-option "N") '("ñ" "Ñ")) ((string= char-option "S") '("ß"))))) (insert (completing-read "-> " my-char-list))))) 
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-") #'accented) ``
 This function works and does what i need to do but it feels quite clunky to me; so, as the title says, I'm asking to the elisp veterans out there: is there a smarter way to do this in elisp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm contemplating a migration from Visual Studio Code to Emacs, and I wanted to replicate one of my favorite VSCode features: instant preview for lightweight markup languages. As part of this transition, I'm exploring Org mode as a powerful alternative to Markdown and AsciiDoc.
 To make this transition smoother, I've created a template that provides a portable Emacs Org Mode setup with instant HTML preview and auto-refresh functionality. Here are the key features:
  
Automatic HTML export on save
 Instant preview using Emacs' built-in eww browser
 Auto-refresh preview on each save
 Automatic package installation (org, htmlize, magit)
 Maximized Emacs window on startup
  
The entire setup is contained in a .dir-locals.el file, making it easy to use in any Org Mode project. Just clone the repo, copy the .dir-locals.el file to your project directory, and you're good to go!
 I'm new to the Emacs ecosystem, so I'd love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or any tips for improvement. Has anyone else created similar setups for transitioning from other editors? What other Emacs features should I explore to enhance my Org Mode experience?

Someone had a similar experience?what should i do?(tried wsl2 with emacs but it's slow,it's still faster to start up my config but using it was a Nightmare)

My goal is to replicate a workflow similar to what I used in Visual Studio Code with Markdown files. Here's what I'm aiming for:
  
Open an .org file on the left and have an "instant view" of the corresponding .html file on the right, automatically updated when I save.
 Use Emacs' built-in HTML viewer eww in GUI mode for the preview.
 Automatically install any required packages (e.g., impatient-mode) if they're not already installed.
 Set up the layout so that only the source .org file (on the left) and the .html preview (on the right) are visible—nothing else.
 Automatically maximize the Emacs window on startup.
 Accomplish all of this using .dir-locals…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've only just gotten started with Emacs this week though I do have experience using Vim. I'm using Doom Emacs.
 I've been trying to set my fonts to what I would like but it doesn't seem to work. I've done my best to follow the examples provided by the Doom Emacs setup guide as well as examples from users but I seem to still be getting the syntax wrong.
 Here's what I have in my config.el:
 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "FiraCode Nerd Font Mono" :size 16 :weight 'semibold) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "FiraCode Nerd Font" :size 16 :weight 'regular) doom-big-font (font-spec :family "FiraCode Nerd Font Mono" :size 20 :weight 'semibold) ) 
 I don't get any errors thrown when I reload but the font doesn't seem to change. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong since set-frame-font works so Emacs is detecting system fonts.
 I've tried only doing it without variable pitch font and big font and that didn't work. Trying it with the whole thing like "FiraCode Nerd Font Mono-semibold-normal-normal" or changing the weight to :weight semibold-normal-normal hasn't worked either.
 I'm at a loss at this point. Any help would be appreciated.

 In every monad tutorial they're called clean and elegant, but I am currently dealing with an IO (maybe Hashmap) and every time I want to perform a lookup I have to do it using
 fmap (fmap (lookup "key")) hashmap
 Im writing a little program that imports a hashmap from JSON and that hashmap then has to constantly be called in my code to check configurations, and I think having to nest fmaps like that is quickly going to make my program completely unreadable, could you imagine having to calculate something using
 5 * (fmap (fmap (lookup "key")) hashmap) ? My first instinct would be to write a function to perform a double fmap with a given function and value, but that just sounds wrong
 how are you supposed to structure your code to prevent something like this? Is this normal?
 Edit: the solution was a refactor and binding the hashmaps in my main function! Thanks a lot!

 I've been working with setting up Eglot for development use, and I've gotten it to connect with pylsp. However, there seems to be a problem when trying to get the full documentation of a function. Suppose we have a functions like so:
 foo(bar): """Function that does stuff""" return x 
 When hovering over a use of this function with the point, the minibuffer would say foo(bar) and leave out the documentation in the docstring. I've had one case where the documentation is displayed, but only the first line of a multi-line dosctring. Is this a problem with Eglot, Pylsp, or something else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying out Nix / Home Manager on Ubuntu and used it to install Emacs. It worked pretty easily, which was great, but I noticed that some weird stuff is happening with my config. E.g. I set the frame position inside of a (when window-system) but that now has no effect on startup. If I eval-buffer it then loads. All the other settings from the config file load, though, and Messages doesn't show any errors.
 I also am seeing some weird stuff like if I change the theme in my config and close and open Emacs again, it hasn't taken affect. But then after I message around with home-manager switch a but the theme loads, but still no frame position change.
 Anyone know what the issue could be?
 The other weird thing is why I open emacs from the terminal, everything works as expected. This is only when opening using the GNOME desktop icon.
 I also just noticed that GNOME has two icons - Emacs (Client) and Emacs. When I open Emacs it works, but Emacs (Client) still has this issue. But it also looks like Emacs just triggers Emacs (Client) to open...

        <updated>2024-09-28T16:19:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
I’m excited to share a project that could be useful for those of you using Raspberry Pi devices in your Zettelkasten workflow. I’ve developed an Ansible playbook that automates the setup of Raspberry Pis, including tools that could enhance your note-taking and text-processing environments.
What’s Included:
Network Configuration: Easily set up Wi-Fi networks, access points, and even USB gadget mode for Raspberry Pi.
Text Processing Tools: Install tools like Pandoc and TexLive, essential for converting notes. There's also a role for my Zettel Composer tool.
Emacs Environment: If you work with Emacs, the playbook can build it from source and set up Spacemacs with integrated tmux.
Ancient Greek Texts: For anyone working with classical languages, there’s a setup for Diogenes with Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) data.
Seafile Client and Sync Notifications: You can configure Seafile for seamless syncing of notes across devices and set up sync notifications to stay updated on changes.
If you’ve got a Raspberry Pi or a whole fleet of them, this playbook should help you get everything up and running quickly. It’s especially handy if you like to experiment with different setups or need consistency across multiple devices.
You can find the playbook here.
Enjoy!]]></summary>

Backend optimizations to further enhance code robustness, modularity, and improve plugin stability.
 
Fixed an issue in version 0.3.2 where rapid updates to the overview file caused synchronization errors with quick notes and marked text.
 
Fixed an issue in version 0.3.2 where the file naming strategy led to frequent re-creation of overview files in Denote mode.
 
Fixed an issue in version 0.3.2 where the overview file failed to synchronize correctly due to improper index file retrieval.
 
 After this period of development, the code for org-zettel-ref-mode has finally become modular and robust. No new features will be introduced before version 0.4. Instead, the focus will be on further componentization of the code and providing more customization options.

 To make the survey interesting and insightful for the community, I've got a few questions for you to answer.
  
Which year did you first use Emacs?
 How many lines of Emacs configuration (init.el, other .el called by init.el, etc.) do you have today?
 Approximately, how many external packages do you install from ELPA/MELPA?
 Do you use with-eval-after-load or use-package or something else like straight.el?
 If you switched from with-eval-after-load to use-package or something else, in which year did you make that switch?
 If you switched from with-eval-after-load to use-package or something else, why did you make the switch?
 If you still use with-eval-after-load, why do you still use it?
 What are the pros and cons of with-eval-after-load in your experience?
 What are the pros and cons of use-package (or another solution) in your experience?

 rather than the current

 The current output.
 Something I did must have triggered it
  
C-M-@ runs the command mark-sexp (found in global-map), which is an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function in ‘lisp.el’.
 It is bound to g C-M-@, g C-M-SPC, C-M-@, C-M-SPC.
 (mark-sexp &optional ARG ALLOW-EXTEND)
  
What is the significance of the leading g?
 I also notice it in Doom, but generally not in regular Emacs.

 It is not obvious to me why that would be the case. Everything works fine when I manually open and evaluate the init.el buffer. Similarly, emacs --debug-init does not reveal any issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently in the process of migrating from Notion to Org-Mode. So far, I have done a lot of manual copy and paste and the occasional conversion from CSV to org-tables, which works quite nicely. But now I want to migrate some databases to a list of headings, and have not found a suitable solution to this yet. I was thinking that perhaps a template-based solution might be convenient - I can for example create a template entry in Yasnippet like this:
 * $0 :PROPERTIES: :SOME_PROPERTY: $1 :END: $2 
 With the idea of applying this to the following CSV snippet:
 title,some_property,some_content My Heading,Important,Lorem Ipsum... 
 Now unfortunately yasnippet does not seem to be really suitable for this, since the fields need to be input manually (I don't think you can easily pass in the $? parameters as a list?). I am wondering if other template libraries might be more suitable for this task, or if anyone has any other bright ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had the following C style definition as the default for many years:
 (defconst my-c-style '("linux" (c-basic-offset . 4) (c-offsets-alist . ((inextern-lang . 0))) (indent-tabs-mode . nil)) "My C style") (c-add-style "my-c-style" my-c-style) (setq c-default-style "my-c-style") 
 After switching to Emacs 29.3, opening a new C file results in the style being applied, except for indent-tabs-mode, which is set to true. I used the Lisp debugger and put a watchpoint on the variable. It is set to nil first when the style is applied, and then immediately to true from the same Lisp function. If I remove the Linux base style then I get nil, as expected. Also, applying the style manually with c-set-style works (i.e., indent-tabs-mode is set to nil).
 Has anyone seen this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, as the title suggests, I am a beginner and I am asking for clarification in order to understand more clearly how currying is being used in the following example;
 data Address = Address { city :: String, street :: String } deriving Show -- without currying mkIncompleteAddress :: String -> Address mkIncompleteAddress street = Address "NYC" street -- with currying mkIncompleteAddress' :: String -> Address mkIncompleteAddress' = Address "NYC" 
 I would like to understand better what's happening 'under the hood' in the example *without currying*.
 As an aside to support the above point, I continued the depth of the example *without currying* from above by taking *both* the city and the street as input into the function, and using currying for both inputs, as so;
 mkIncompleteAddress2 :: String -> String -> Address mkIncompleteAddress2 = Address Prelude> mkIncompleteAddress2 "NYC" "ABC Street" Address {city = "NYC", street = "ABC Street"} 
 The idea about what's happening in the background still eludes me. I would appreciate clarification as to understand the functionality better.
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, as the title suggests, I am a beginner and I am asking for clarification about a specific detail concerning lambda expressions in Haskell.
 While GHCI allows me to do the following,
 Prelude> (\x y -> x + (\z -> z) y) 100 1 111 
 I am unable to do the following;
 Prelude> (\x -> x + (\y -> y)) 100 1 * Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Num (p -> p) (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this) * When checking the inferred type it :: forall p. (Num p, Num (p -> p)) => p 
 As seen above, attempting to run this results in an error (which I can't make sense of). I am trying to assign 100 to 'x', and 1 to 'y'. What is preventing 1 from being assigned to 'y'?
 I was under the impression that currying would allow for first filling in 'x', then afterwards, filling in 'y'. Clearly, my assumption was wrong.
 Thanks in advance

 When moving the cursor over a flycheck error it should display a message and show the global-map keymap.
 When moving the cursor to a character with a flycheck overlay emacs freezes (the cursor doesn't move):
 Frozen emacs (the cursore is just before the `f ;`
 The message appears briefly and is then replaced with the first line of (which-key-show-keymap 'global-map) and if I press any key emacs unfreezes and displays the following error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil) redisplay--pre-redisplay-functions(t) redisplay_internal\ \(C\ function\)() read-key-sequence-vector(nil nil t nil nil t) read-key() which-key--show-keymap("global-map" (keymap #^[nil nil keymap <shortened >...)) which-key-show-keymap(global-map) funcall-interactively(which-key-show-keymap global-map) test-overlay-cursor(#<window 3 on main.ml> 46 entered) cursor-sensor--detect() 
 I tested with emacs -Q and I have the same behaviour. If I remove the (which-key ...) part, no bug/freeze appears. It looks like I'm not supposed to call a function that creates a new buffer.

Disclaimer: I used Google Translator a lot. Expressions can be strange. I would appreciate your feedback 
This is to help Zettelkasten newbies easily understand how to do Zettelkasten.
How to do Zettelkasten is simple:
Let's look at them one by one.
1. Take notes.
Just take a note. Easy, right? When taking notes, write only one piece of knowledge per note. Let's take an example.
# 202409260746 Zettelkasten is a toolkit for thinking

Zettelkasten means slip-box in German
and is a note-taking method used by Niklas Luhmann.

He published 50 books and over 600 articles with Zettelkasten.
What makes Zettelkasten so powerful is its ability to link notes
together.

The benefits of using the Zettelkasten method are as follows…]]></summary>

 #+TODO: QUERY THOUGHT INSIGHT INTERESTING-QUOTE | QUERY-CLEARED THOUGHT-RESOLVED INSIGHT-INTERNALISED
 The keywords can be changed according to needs and they can filtered for view in org-agenda view (t view). You can shorten the keywords also according to your sensibilities. I use Q for queries and questions. Period (.) for thoughts and insights that are my own and double quotes("") for quotes of interest. This way, you may make systematic notes to your readings. You get a filtered view and the org file itself in which you take the notes acts as a linear document that takes notes as the readings goes forward. Multiple frames of view are retained. Feel free to ask for any clarifications or critique my post (I am new to reddit, I would like to learn the norms).

Curious to hear your thoughts about "flashcards". I recently used them to get over a big hump.
I was trying to learn something specific in programming. It is a huge library, and although I am a fluent programmer (having programmed everyday for the last two decades), I was resisiting this.
What helped me over the hump was a combination of my Zk with Anki, a free flashcard system, which does spaced repetition. I think I now know the library I wanted to master really well: the size is what had been a hinderance and no longer seems to be. I made around 200 cards, and I know them inside out now.
Long term, of course, it is the zettelkasten that will help me with the big picture. But @Sascha or others: have you experimented with Anki and if so how has it worked out?]]></summary>

I want to learn Haskell as my first language, but it seems that a lot of the resources for it are aimed at people who already program imperatively. Does anyone have advice or resources for someone who knows nothing? Preferably resources that will show how different aspects of Haskell are used within programming...I enjoy thinking abstractly but programming seems so different to the type of thinking I'm used to. Also, could anyone help me install Haskell? I can't seem to figure out how to get it to function. I've just been trying stuff in the Haskell playground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm using ligatures.el and I would like to enable all ligatures for every programming language except VHDL, for which `<=` should look like an arrow instead of `≤`.
 I tried the following:
 (ligature-set-ligatures 'prog-mode '( ... "<=" ... ) ) (ligature-set-ligatures 'vhdl-mode '( ... ... ) ) 
 But the more specific mode doesn't override prog-mode, so all ligatures are enabled in any case. I also tried to defining a custom mode like this:
 (define-derived-mode prog-except-vhdl-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (lambda () (when (and (not (derived-mode-p 'vhdl-mode)) (not (derived-mode-p 'prog-except-vhdl-mode)) ;; otherwise I get an infinite loop ) (prog-except-vhdl-mode) ) ) ) (ligature-set-ligatures 'prog-except-vhdl-mode '(... ...)) (ligature-set-ligatures 'vhdl-mode '(... "<=" ...)) 
 This "works" (I get the ligature in prog mode but not in VHDL) but prog-except-vhdl-mode overrides the file type's associated major mode so I lose syntax highlighting for everything except VHDL.
 Is there a way to create a non-exclusive major mode like prog-mode? (ligature-set-ligatures doesn't take a minor mode)

 I'm trying to work on this using Emacs, but I couldn't make the LSP work with it. I used the configuration from this tutorial that is linked in the github page of java-lsp package:
 https://xpressrazor.wordpress.com/2020/11/04/java-programming-in-emacs/
  
Open emacs, wait for first time execution of init.el
 Open project folder, open some file, wait for lsp server be installed
 Emacs suggests adding project folder to workspace, I accept its suggestion and give the project root
 LSP is activated but gives me the following message: "xxx.java is a non-project file, only syntax errors are reported"
  
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what to do:
  
Tried to open the project in VSCode (found this message in stackoverflow from VSCode users), LSP works with my project
 Created a new gradle project, copied source code to it, LSP works with this gradle project
  
What am I doing wrong? I'm so confused.
 Edit - found the problem:
 I'm really unlucky. I put a ".project" folder with some notes in todo org files to be like a "personal mini jira"... Eclipse server needs this path for its ".project" XML file. It's so embarrassing lol

 I was thinking to do the following: * List of tasks 1. Item 1. Person A. 2. Item 2. Person B. 3. Item 3. Person A. And so on, where person name is a tag. But, tags go to the * ie List of tasks. So that would not work. The other way is write as above and search with C-c s name. Wondering if this is the only way or is there some other mechanism or a smarter way to do it.
 Pointing to the appropriate documentation would be enough. Thanks for your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I recently came across emacs, and wanted to give it a go. I installed the most recent version from the main GNU ftp server. However, I somehow managed to install directly onto my desktop folder rather than in program files like every other typical install I would do. Long story short, all my files have disappeared from that folder. Uninstalled emacs assuming I had downloaded a virus but after doing several system checks I can't identify anything. I have looked through practically all my files on my pc and local disk storage hasn't changed much which seems to tell me they're still somewhere? Files are pretty important (don't have a full back up) so any help would be appreciated.
 Details:
 I downloaded this file here: https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-29/emacs-29.4-installer.exe
 PC is running windows 10 64 bit.
 Files are a large number of .docx files along with photos (jpg and png mostly) and a bunch of miscellaneous txt files etc.
 Folder/Path I'm talking about is: This PC > Desktop.

Please see the hyperdrive info manual for installation and setup instructions. hyperdrive-org-transclusion augments the org-transclusion package by Noboru Ota by allowing you to transclude hyperdrive content over a network. You can also transclude specific Org document headings by linking to them.
 This package is similar in nature to org-transclusion-http, which also lets you transclude content over the network (HTTP, not hyper).
 Feedback welcome! If you'd like to support USHIN's work financially, please donate here.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm experiencing some wierd behaviour with indent-bars-mode. It works flawlessly when called interactively (via M-x or custom key-binding is the same). When called via hook, on the other hand, it activates the mode, but it does not draw the bars, therefore I have to call it manually twice (once to deactivate the mode and a second time to re-activate it); although this gets the bars showing, it completely messes up my syntax highlighting. The -very minimal- configuration that I have used is:
 lisp (use-package indent-bars-mode :ensure t :hook (rust-mode . indent-bars-mode))  am I the only one having this issue? am I doing something wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Try M-: (yes-or-no-p "what? ") RET yes RET
 Then check C-x b *Messages* RET. The return value t is shown in the *Messages* buffer:
 t 
 Now try M-: (y-or-n-p "what? ") RET y
 Check C-x b *Messages* RET again. The return value t is shown in the *Messages* buffer. But it is preceded by the prompt string and the answer string too. Like so:
 what? (y or n) y t 
 Why does this difference in behavior exist? Why does y-or-n-p need to print the prompt string and the answer string?
 Source of y-or-n-p where it decides to print the prompt and answer: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/subr.el#L3952 But I don't understand why it was written like this to print the prompt and answer?
 This is a problem for me while defining interactive functions. Like so:
 (defun toggle-linum-good () (interactive) (when (yes-or-no-p "toggle line numbers ? ") (display-line-numbers-mode 'toggle))) (defun toggle-linum-bad () (interactive) (when (y-or-n-p "toggle line numbers ? ") (display-line-numbers-mode 'toggle))) 
 Now if I run M-x toggle-linum-good RET, it toggles the line numbers without printing the prompt and my answer once again at the echo area.
 But if I run M-x toggle-linum-bad RET, it toggles the line numbers but after doing that, it prints the prompt and my answer once again to the echo area.
 Why does y-or-n-p need to print the prompt and answer again?

 Version 0.3.2 mainly focuses on backend optimization, reducing the codebase by nearly half, resulting in improved runtime efficiency.
 v0.3.2 (2024-09-24)
 • Improved compatibility with Org-roam v2: it is now possible to update literature notes into the Org-roam database.
 • Minor improvements to file naming.
 • Streamlined and modularized the code.

I've recently been demoing The Archive app, and one feature I've really come to appreciate is the link-as-search functionality (as opposed to the more common link-as-direct functionality found in other editors). This got me wondering—what other editors have link-as-search?
I searched the forums and found this thread where @Sasha mentioned that Zettlr has link-as-search functionality:

  
One big reason for Zettlr is the link-as-search functionality. This is perhaps the most important feature implementation to make an app software-agnostic.


Zettlr's documentation covers link-as-search here.
Additionally, I found a thread on the topic of link-as-search vs link-as-direct
Does anyone know of any other editors with built-in link-as-search functionality?]]></summary>

more than 500,000 projects hosted on the main Python repository,
PyPI), is used both for software engineering and
scientific research. Both have similar requirements for
reproducibility. But, as we will see, the practices are quite
different.
In fact, the Python ecosystem and community is notorious for the countless ways it uses to declare dependencies.
As we were developping FawltyDeps1,
a tool to ensure that declared dependencies match the actual imports
in the code, we had to accommodate many of these ways.
This got us thinking:
Could FawltyDeps be used
to gain insights into how packaging is done across Python ecosystems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came across an analogy someone made about passion years ago that has stuck with me ever since. The analogy is:
You can tell if an Italian chef is still passionate about what they do not through the inspired specials or the amazing cannolis or tiramisu, but all you have to do is look at the red sauce. The red sauce is something they’re supposed to make fresh every day; It’s one of the main fundamentals of being an Italian chef. It’s also something that can easily become the mundane if they’re not careful. It’s in the fundamentals that a dip in passion is shown in.
I’m VERY new to building my network of notes, so I’m curious, would most people put this analogy as a separate note like “Red Sauce Analogy” or would this live in a note for the overall concept titled “When passion slips, it shows in the mundane first”?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I started my ZK in 2018, I adopted the Barbell Method of Reading as my note-taking workflow. I've made only minor tweaks over time. Today, I still adhere to the core idea of reading freely, quickly noting everything that captures my interest, and then revisiting and processing those notes before adding them to my ZK, connecting them with existing ideas.
This is my second processing of @Sascha's article. Thank you, Sascha, for the clear coaching on the simple idea of the two stages of note-making that got me going.
Critiques welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! New to emacs here. I needed some help in how emacs is setting up my background color. If I start emacs with just that, it works. But emacsclient still gives the original background color of the theme.
 I'm using elpaca with use-package integration.
 Here is my config:
  (use-package doom-themes :demand :config (load-theme 'doom-tokyo-night t) (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'background-color "#0A0A0A") (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha-background 95) (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha-background . 95))) 
 Background transparency works in both of them, however, the colour is set to black in only emacs. How can I fix this? Thanks.

 I have also tried M-x keymap-local-set, but the <up> key stays bound to eshell-previous-matching-input-from-input. Curiously, it looks like eshell-mode-map does get updated:
 (keymap (down . next-line) (up . previous-line) (1 . eshell-bol) (27 keymap (12 . eshell-show-output) (13 . eshell-queue-input)) (13 . eshell-send-input) (3 . eshell-command-map))

Search Goal: 
 Use ripgrep (rg) to search through my ~/notes directory.
 Search for multiple words that may appear in any order, across multiple lines within files.
 The search should be case-insensitive and only return file names that contain all the specified words.
 Integrate the search with Helm to have a dynamic, real-time updating interface.
 
  
What I've Tried:
  
Using helm-rg and helm-ag**:**
  
I wrote a custom Emacs function to adjust the search pattern using lookahead assertions, enabling multi-word, any-order searches.

 Emacs EWW (Emacs Web Wowser) is a web browser package for Emacs, allowing users to browse URLs within an Emacs buffer. It provides a simple and lightweight way to access the web from within the Emacs environment. EWW was originally written by Lars Ingebrigtsen and is now maintained by the GNU Emacs project.
 One of the key features of EWW is its ability to display web pages inline, without requiring an external browser. This is achieved through the use of an HTML renderer, shr.el, which renders HTML pages directly within the Emacs buffer. EWW also supports viewing PDFs inline, using the doc-view-mode, and can be customized using the mailcap mechanism.
 EWW has several unique features that set it apart from other web browsers. It can display images inline, if Emacs was built with image support, and can block specific images completely by customizing shr-blocked-images. Additionally, EWW uses the colors declared in the HTML page, but adjusts them if needed to maintain a certain minimum contrast.
 Users can interact with EWW using a variety of commands, including eww-copy-page-url to copy the URL of the current page into the kill ring, and eww-bookmark-kill to delete bookmarks. EWW also provides a buffer for managing bookmarks, which can be accessed using M-x eww-bookmarks.
 EWW is highly customizable, with many variables and options available for tweaking its behavior. For example, the eww-history-limit variable controls the number of history entries kept, and can be set to nil to allow the history list to grow indefinitely. Additionally, users can customize image display using shr-inhibit-images and shr-blocked-images.
 Overall, Emacs EWW provides a convenient and flexible way to access the web from within Emacs, making it an attractive option for developers and power users who value the integration and customization offered by the Emacs environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR
Hello everyone!
This is my first post on the forum and I think it is due, as I have not been able to find an answer.
This current college year I started doing my zk on Obsidian and so far it's been wonderful!
I know that each app is different and that it's better for me to adapt to those apps instead of looking for one that is perfect for my needs. 
Yesterday I found Sublimeless Zettelkasten by @rene. It really meets all my needs, it's amazing!
However I have never used IDs for my notes, but used the title directly; so all the links in my notes are like this: [[note-title]]. I know that Sublimeless ZK works with IDs so I added to all my notes an ID before the file name according to their creation date so that I could see them in the application.
The problem is in the links inside the notes (those I don't plan to change because they are exaggeratedly too many xd).
I already read the README on GitHub of the application, but I understand little or almost no code, so my question is: 
An apology if the question is very naive but I really loved Rene's app and would love to use it as soon as possible with my existing notes.
Best regards and thanks for reading,
Antonio]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lispy is a package which combines modal editing with Lisp by turning on modal editing whenever the cursor is near parens. This allows for single keystroke operations, such as e to evaluate an s-expression (which with eros will then show the result inline). It's paredit with less keystrokes!
 There hasn't been a Lispy release since 2015, and a commit or PR merge for a couple of years. 
 abo-abo, a hero of mine, disappeared from Lispy around the time his child was born. And who can blame him? We're happy for him! He deserves the time with family after all he has done for us.
 But many of us depend upon the Lispy package, so I have made a temporary fork here until abo-abo returns: https://github.com/enzuru/lispy
 I have applied the last few important PRs to get Lispy working again. I have tested it successfully on Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp, Guile, and Clojure. Let me know if it works for you!

 That paper was quoted by Erik Meijer in FP101x several years ago.
 Do you happen to know the title of such paper or where to find it these days?
 There is only one piece of information about it In the forum thread in which the paper was quoted.
  
It is especially remarkable since, in the Haskell community, monads are still considered as one of the most advanced and difficult features to master
  
Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I watched this Tsoding Video on JSON parsing in Haskell. I have studied that video over and over trying to understand why exactly is a certain abstraction he uses so useful and refactorable. Implementing interfaces/typeclasses for some types for certain transformations to be applicable on those types and then getting these other auto-derived transformations for the type so seamlessly is mind-blowing. And then the main recipe is this whole abstraction for the parser itself which is wrapped in generic parser type that as I understand allows for seamless composition and maybe... better semantic meaning or something?
 Now the problem is though I understand at least some of the design abstractions for this specific problem (and still learning functions like *> and <* which still trip me), I dont get how to scale this skill to spot these clever abstractions in other problems and especially how to use typeclasses. Is the average Haskeller expected to understand this stuff easily and implement from scratch on his own or do they just follow these design principles put in place by legendary white paper author programmers without giving much thought? I wanna know if im just too dumb for haskell lol. And give me resources/books for learning. Thanks.

 I'm using emacs to keep my journal (notes, tasks, etc) but it's really frustrating that I can't just carry my macbook with me all the time.
 It'd be nice to have a tiny (maybe the size of iPad mini) laptop I could reasonably use emacs on (and some coding stuff like lisp/ruby/jvm).
 There's a range of GPD devices that seem to fit the profile but they're made for gaming and are really pricey. I just want a simple linux machine (I'd even be ok if it didn't have X, years ago I had a netbook running Arch I used without graphics for a year).
 I also found a better priced laptop from Fsjun. Never heard of them before. And apparently, there're other similar brands.
 Any recommendations?

 The article is called “Inline your boilerplate – harnessing Scala 3 metaprogramming without macros.” Even though it’s a bit old and doesn’t have fully working code, after studying with ChatGPT for a week based on the content, I was able to grasp the concept of Scala metaprogramming.
 It seems like many people are looking for resources on Scala 3 metaprogramming, and I believe reading the article I shared will be very helpful for you as well.
 I also completed the code based on the blog post and created a Gist I hope this will be helpful to anyone who needs it.

The only difference is that in machine A I have X11 (since I have NVIDIA Quadro T1000 Mobile graphics card in machine A and the nvidia driver 535 (that comes with Bookworm) does not work well with Wayland) and in machine B I have Wayland (no nvidia card).
 For some reason machine A (with X11) is slow when I type fast. The characters appear in the screen after some lag, which is really annoying. 
 I have tried Emacs profiler in both machines, and the profiler shows pretty much the same in both machines:
 187 66% - command-execute
 187 66% - call-interactively
 187 66% - apply
 187 66% + call-interactively@ido-cr+-record-current-command

 64 22% - linum-update-window
 8 2% display-graphic-p
 25 8% + ...
 6 2% + redisplay_internal (C function)
 The only difference is in the X11 machine: "display-graphic-p".
 Is there some advice how to debug this lagginess issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm uncertain if this is the right place to post this. I originally was going to post here because I was going to ask about the differences in features/usage between org-roam and denote, but I kept thinking about it, and I feel like my overarching question should be about my notetaking strategy in general, which tools are then subordinate to.
 I have been trying GTD recently. I find the idea of the inbox to be really valuable, and I did an initial thoughtdump of every potential open loop I had in my mind. It turned out that a lot of it was less task-oriented and more introspective: things about my future, things about how I should engage with parts of the world, and so forth. The only "next action" I could get for these was to journal about it.
 Now, I'm attempting to determine how I should organize journal-notes like these. I think extracting parts of my introspective writing into its own note, and linking those notes together would have value to me (I don't particularly think I'd want to duplicate a full-on Zettelkasten system, but parts of it seem useful to pick up). But I don't really know. A lot of the systems I've read about are either about explicit actionability (GTD, PARA...) or about synthesizing sources and finding interesting connections (Zettelkasten). Is there anything for structured introspection? does anyone do that, and what does your system look like?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks!
 I just hacked together a clone of Python's instructor library and I'm looking for early feedback. That library makes using LLMs programmatically very convenient and it seems elisp would benefit from that.
 The core of what Instructor does is allow coders to define a class in Python and then to use that class to define the function-calling / JSON structured output of the LLM as well as instantiate that class based on the response of the LLM. So I tried to replicate this with defstructs as I could.
 Here's the link to the repo (obviously it's called instructor.el). It's fewer than 100 lines of code at the moment. https://github.com/Trevoke/instructor.el
 And the basic usage pattern looks like this:
 (setq llm (make-llm-ollama :chat-model "llama3.1")) ;; for valid types see the help for `make-llm-function-arg' and look at the type. (instructor-defstruct dnd-character (name nil :type string :description "The character's name") (class nil :type string :description "The character's class") (race nil :type string :description "The character's race in the D&D setting") (skills nil :type (list string) :description "The skills the character has")) (instructor-call :llm llm :type 'dnd-character :prompt "Make a starter character for D&D 5th edition.") ;; (#s(dnd-character :name "Eilif Stonefist" :class "Fighter" :race "Human" :skills ;; ["Acrobatics" "Athletics"]))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't use emacs for programming, I use orgmode as an outliner a lot and for some task management. I want to integrate PDF and epub highlights into my notes, so I tried to install the org-noter package on my emacs 29.4.
 I mindlessly copied the following from the github page to my ~/.emacs file:
 (use-package org-noter
 :load-path "<path-to-org-noter>"
 :ensure t
 :demand t)
 It returned the error:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install org-noter: https://melpa.org/packages/org-noter-20240509.1756.tar: Not found
 Error (use-package): Cannot load org-noter
 I tried M-x package-install and got a similar error:
 Contacting host: melpa.org:443
 package--with-response-buffer-1: https://melpa.org/packages/org-noter-20240509.1756.tar: Not found
 Then, I actually read the lines, and it seems like it's expecting me to tell it a directory? I don't want to download and manually install the package, I want it to update automatically, but I don't see how to do that. I've already installed the which-key package with use package, without providing a directory, with:
 (use-package which-key
 :init (which-key-mode)
 :diminish which-key-mode
 :config
 (setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, this is something I have been struggling with for a while. Every now and then I accidentally rebind a key that I didn't want to rebind. I could not figure out how to "undo" that. In some cases, if it is a simple command and I know which command it was before, I guess I can rebind it (although sometimes this is hard if it only applies to particular modes).
 But it just so happens that I now accidentally rebound C-h and I have no clue on how to fix that (other than completely restarting emacs, which does not seem like a very elegant and satisfying solution).
 Is there a way to "restore" a keybinding to its default state? Or (next best option) a way to "save" my keybindings, so I can restore from a restore-point?
 For now, I guess I will have to restart emacs (again....) which is always a bummer if you have 100 open buffers and a bunch of tabs with stuff you are working on.

 This is my first time posting here to get some help from you ! :)
 As the title say, i'm a main vim user for the past year. But, for any reason, I wanted to try emacs (with evil mode of course aha). 
 I'm still a bit confused with some keybinding, not because of evil mode or emacs, but because i'm on a Mac. 
 So, the fact is that I mainly program in C. I see that there is something called lsp-mode here :
 https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/CPP-guide/
 The installation process is really smooth and i'm now using a super duper cool looking IDE ! But here's lay my problem :
 On the website, there is a lot of keybinding like this :
 s-l r r
 But even with this on my fresh init.el file :
 (setq mac-command-modifier 'super)
 I cannot do "super key" command. Do you have any advice to help me ? :)
 (also, I you have any tips with evil mode, or with emacs itself, please don't hesitate and tell them to me!)

That gives me a rough idea, but am interested in knowing more on the theory (I must add, "if I can", as the the literature on types and category theory often terrifies me).

 One thing that I'm struggling with is using the agenda functionality. I really like the idea of using it to get an overview of my events/ scheduled items, and I do schedule things, but I keep forgetting to actually look at the agenda view. I know that this is 90% a me problem, but I was wondering what the best solutions for this is, either packages or some custom elisp (although I don't really know how write elisp yet).
 I would like the agenda to be a little bit "in my face", in terms of making me remember to look at it, and it would also be nice to have some sort of reminder, notification or alert when there are events/ scheduled items in the next X days.
 If you have any suggestions, ideas for how to build a better workflow or just pointers to some resources, I would be very grateful.
