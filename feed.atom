 GHC Haskell's RTS is written in a mixture of C and Haskell. I believe a worthy goal should be to rewrite all C code (and any other code that isn't memory safe) in a memory-safe language (e.g., Rust).
 The Haskell Foundation should make this a high-priority project, and it should seek funding from national and international agencies to staff it.

 I am new to Haskell and when I code Haskell on vscode, an error message says "openTempFile: invalid argument (Invalid argument)compiler". Even though there is no syntax error and I can load the file into ghci and run the functions, it's annoying and I was trying to figure out how to remove that message.
 The image of error message is attached

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to take lecture notes using `org-mode` and `cdlatex-mode`. The problem I meet is when I try to use `Tab` to expand `fr` it doesn't expand correctly.
 `\(fr<Tab>\)` will become `\(\begin{frame}[]\frametitle{}\end{frame}\)` instead of `\(\frac{}{}\)` and there is a warning saying that `Warning (org-element): ‘org-element-at-point’ cannot be used in non-Org buffer #<buffer MatrixComputation.org> (latex-mode)`. 
 I'm using `doom emacs` and only open `org-cdlatex-mode` as a minor mode. How can I fix this problem to make `\(fr<Tab>\)` works properly? 
 By the way, I also want to know how can I make an abbreviation like `fr`, which I can expand it in a latex fragment. I have try `(setq cdlatex-env-alist'(("limit" "\\lim_{?}" nil)))` and `(setq cdlatex-command-alist
 '(("lim" "Insert fraction env" "" cdlatex-environment ("limit") t nil)))` but this seems only works for the abbreviation at the beginning of a line.

Why we have 2 of them? Are both from Haskell community? Whats the standard and quick way to start project? Also, I tried cabal, and to add a dependencies, you have to manually edit the .cabal file, can't you do something like npm i <package> and it changes the package.json for cabal ?

The main focus of this update has been to improve its compatibility with org-roam. Additionally, the previously provided `convert-to-org.py` script can now be executed directly within Emacs, allowing for document conversion without leaving this productive environment.
 Although these are just two minor main updates, their impact is significant. It reminds me of a saying: "No matter how simple the functionality, the complexity behind it is immeasurable." To ensure compatibility with org-roam, I've changed the working logic of org-zettel-ref-mode from generating a new file and directly overwriting it each time to incremental updates. I've also studied the org-roam API and managed to maintain stable IDs…]]></summary>

 If they are hashes, what are they hashes of? Can I reproduce these hashes somehow?

Naively, "making invalid states unrepresentable" seems like it'd couple you to a single understanding of the problem space, causing issues when your past assumptions are challenged etc. How do you architect things for the long term?
 
What sort of warts appear in older Haskell code bases? How do you handle/prevent them?
 
What "patterns" are common? (Gang of 4 patterns, "clean" code etc. were of course mistakes/bandaids for missing features.) In Lisp, I theoretically believe any recurring pattern should be abstracted away as a macro so there's no real architecture left. What's the Platonic optimal in Haskell?
 
  
I found:
  
Next Level MTL on tools for growing monad transformer stacks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPup5Iuaqw
 https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/4srjcc/architecture_patterns_for_larger_haskell_programs/ discusses e.g. memoization (can't) and instrumenting observability, which makes "functional core" imperative monadic shell" tedious(?). I suspect a deeper understanding of monads (e.g. Van Laarhoven free helps (like dependency injection as the code base evolves)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently stumbled upon `magit-diff-visit-file`, which is bound to RET in a magit diff view. When on a removed line, it jumps back to the previous blob containing that line, which is handy, yet it also seems to revert the worktree file to that old blob, even if I have uncommitted changes to that file.
 This happened a couple of times (magit 4.0.0 and 4.1.0), and I could not find any way to revert back to my (uncommitted) worktree file except for copying back the ~ backup file.
 There is a `magit-diff-visit-worktree-file` command, but that one requires the magit status buffer to still show the uncommitted worktree changes, which is no longer the case if closing the status buffer after invoking `magit-diff-visit-file`.
 Does anyone know an option to either (1) revert to the worktree version after `magit-diff-visit-file`, or (2) somehow warn the user before `magit-diff-visit-file` is about to execute?

 The message says error, but I'm pretty sure it's not because bug-hunter skips over it.
 I could be triggering this via (debug-on-message "Package cl").
 I'm not an expert, but I can step through files and use bug-hunter, etc. This has me stumped right now. I want to eliminate or at least identify this last use of CL in my setup. This message will only appear once, during a fresh cold startup. Obviously, the Lisp engine's PC (program counter) knows where this happened, but it doesn't tell me anything useful. Any suggestions from people who debug regularly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get org-columns to show a column without the amount of hours clocked in the current week.
 I saw that org-mode has a function (org-clock-sum-today) that it uses for the CLOCKSUM_T special property:
 https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/blob/9183e3c723b812360d1042196416d521db590e9f/lisp/org-colview.el#L894
 I also saw that there's a (org-clock-sum-custom):
 https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/blob/9183e3c723b812360d1042196416d521db590e9f/lisp/org-clock.el#L1951
 So I tried to overwrite the org-columns function in my init.el, adding a new condition for that function like: 
  (when (assoc "CLOCKSUM_W" org-columns-current-fmt-compiled) (org-clock-sum-custom nil 'thisweek)) 
 But it does not fill the CLOCKSUM_W column that I added. Any idea on what I could try?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just curious how folks are feeling these days about Reddit alternatives. I've been enjoying Lemmy, personally, and I find that for technical stuff in particular the communities are definitely growing, feeling less ghost-town-ish little by little.
 Haskell-wise, it seems like https://programming.dev/c/haskell has the most subscribers (see, e.g. this search on lemmy explorer), but is definitely still a ghost town. (And https://programming.dev/c/functional_programming is slightly less than a ghost town.)
 Philosophically, I'm very much in favor of Lemmy, or basically any other more "open" alternative to Reddit. But I get the challenges of hoisting and moving an entire community who all is here for different reasons, have different ideas, etc.
 By the way, people discussed this at length in these two posts a little over a year ago, which makes for good reading:
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/146d3jz/rhaskell_and_the_recent_news_regarding_reddit/
 https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/14dqllb/vote_on_the_future_of_rhaskell/
  
There were plenty of folks in favor of jumping ship (whether to Lemmy or Discourse), but it seems that inertia may have won out, as it often does.
 How are folks feeling these days? Has Discourse filled the gap? Was it simply easier to keep on with Reddit? Anyone out there still pine for a different platform for discussion?

 `` The "git-commit.el" library is no longer distributed as a separate package. It is now distributed as part of themagit' package.
 The git-commit' package now does nothing but display this warning. If it is located earlier on theload-path' than magit' is, then that prevents the proper "git-commit.el" libraries frommagit' from being loaded.
 Please uninstalling git-commit' and then restart Emacs. ``
 So, I go ahead and remove git-commit package with package-delete and after restarting Emacs I get the following on the Messages buffer:
  Unable to activate package ‘magit’. Required package ‘git-commit-4.0.0’ is unavailable 
 Is this some kind of chicken and egg problem? anybody experiencing this?
  
Ok, found the issue!
 The version of magit on nongnu is old, the new version is only on melpa, so, if you have this configuration magit will fail:
  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") ("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ("nongnu" .

 If melpa is configured to have a higher priority than nongnu then everything works...

 The files are GUI design text files where items are outlined and nested underneath their parent containers, so if there is change somewhere, all I need is to go the outermost applicable parent and commit all the hunks there automatically.
 Not collapsing could result in large unmodified regions appearing in the display, but I'm happy for them to be shown if it helped keep my bearings within the file.
 It would also help if the line numbers where also displayed instead of the diff line number markers.
 I could also open the original file on the side, possible with diff-hl-mode or some other such plugin to help.

 According to the manual, you can make a "datetree" capture template ((file+olp+datetree "filename" [ "Level 1 heading" ...])), which works great, but I'd like to customise it for my use - I'd like it to align with my university schedule.
 Ideally, I'd like to have one heading per university week (starting at ISO week ~40 for this semester - so I'd like ISO's W40 to be my Week 1), then one sub-heading per day. How would I go about doing this? Is there a way to create my own datetree type, or do I have to write my own capture template function? If I need to do it all myself, are there any guides/examples I can follow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just made the switch from Neovim a few weeks ago and I started using u/Nicolas-Rougier's nano-emacs distribution. (Love the distribution btw <3)
 I've also experimented with different model editing systems like meow, evil and god-mode because while I ditched Neovim for Emacs for the features, I still believe the modal editing style is perfect for me. As of now, I'm really happy with god-mode because of its ease of use and its complete integration with the rest of emacs.
 However, I would like to use vim-like keys to edit in text buffers and regular emacs keybinds with god-mode everywhere else, since my entire system (WM, browser, etc.) has been optimized to use vim-like keys.
 In order to achieve this, I am trying to create a minor mode that overrides keybindings in all other modes (I'm not sure this is the best idea).
 So far, I have done something like this, and the commented part has not worked (understandably).
 (use-package god-mode :straight t :config (setq god-exempt-major-modes nil) (setq god-exempt-predicates nil) (define-key global-map (kbd "<escape>") 'god-local-mode) (define-key god-local-mode-map (kbd "i") 'god-local-mode) (god-mode)) (define-key global-map (kbd "C-x r f") 'recentf) (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c c") 'org-capture) (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c a") 'nano-agenda) (define-minor-mode divine-mode nil :global t :group 'nano :lighter " DiVine" :keymap (list (cons (kbd "C-S-h") (kbd "C-h")) (cons (kbd "C-h") (kbd "C-b")) (cons (kbd "C-j") (kbd "C-n")) (cons (kbd "C-k") (kbd "C-p")) (cons (kbd "C-l") (kbd "C-f")))) 
 The thing I'm looking for is the ability to do something like "Make C-j perform whatever function C-n does in the currently active major+minor modes". Also, since C-h is being rebound, I would like to rebind the help prefix key to C-S-h and so on for all the keys that I'm rebinding.
 Is something like this possible?

 What do you use and why ?

They don't even show a key has been pressed with ctl-h k. However, chords like shift-ctl-left/right work just fine!
 Note: I access Linux via ETX remote desktop from my Macbook.
 I checked xev and Linux is seeing the keys. I also tried 29.1 (emacsformacosx.com) on my Macbook Pro M1 and it works fine. Any ideas? I'm pretty fuzzy on stuff like xmodmap. Haven't had to mess with that for many years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using elfeed and elfeed+org for about 3 years. In that time my feed count has gone from 0 to ~130 but it has been at ~130 for about the last 2 years. Until very recently (last 2-3 weeks), refreshing the feeds was an operation that took maybe 1-2 minutes but it was fine because I continued to be able to use Emacs while the operation was in progress. In the last 2 weeks or so that changed: now when I refresh the feeds Emacs becomes unusable for maybe as long as 3-4 minutes. As in even receiving keyboard input for M-x commands is unreliable. 
 I'm curious if anyone else has seen this behavior? And perhaps has identified a root cause? And a fix?
 Relevant info:
 - I do and have always run emacs-next from guix which currently sits at 30.6.0.
 - I run the latest elfeed and elfeed-org updated approx weekly via straight.el and then, about year ago, via elpaca.
 - I have always run elfeed with the default value for elfeed-use-curl (t).
 - My workstation is fairly beefy: 24 x i5s with lots of RAM. 
 thx
 EDIT: I've recently started running the profiler during elfeed refreshes to see if it might point me in a useful direction. So far, nothing.

It's not far from the beach to the next big settlement. Forum Zettelkasten is written on a big sign at the entrance to the village.
The street is a hive of activity. The people here seem very friendly and open. Small groups have formed on many corners, chatting animatedly. I approached them to listen to some of their conversations. They noticed me and greeted me warmly.
Unfortunately, I don't understand their language. Some words sound familiar, others are completely new to me. Now I'm standing right next to them. The word Zettel is repeated several times - the word I had already read on the big sign. I try to say it in my own language. They don't seem to understand me either.
Luckily I always have a piece of paper and a pencil with me when I'm out and about. I draw a few lines and some symbols. The joy is great. The others also know this way of communicating with strangers.
What does your journey look like? Do you have a map [1]? Where are you travelling from?

I would like to download some class packages such as "turabian-researchpaper" from CTAN and then use them in an org doc which I can then export to LaTeX. I am coming from Rmarkdown, in which this was trivial: just put the class where LaTeX can find it and then call out the class in arbitrary LaTeX code within the .rmd file. However, with Emacs, this does not work.
 I figured out that you have to use an instance of (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes ...) followed by some specifications for that class so that ox-latex can parse it. But I have only found examples of how to add common classes like report or book, not custom classes and downloaded classes. Is there some way to general…]]></summary>

 We're proud to release Helenus for Scala 3!
 Helenus is collection of Scala utilities for Apache Cassandra. Its goal is to make interacting with Cassandra easier, in a type-safe manner, while trying to avoid introducing a complex API.
 Most of the API stays the same as its Scala 2 counterpart, the only notable difference is how typeclasses are derived. Whereas in Scala 2 for a case class we'd do RowMapper[Hotel] in Scala 3 we can do case class Hotel(...) derives RowMapper.
 In future releases we hope to get these APIs much closer by providing similar methods.

 The e-book version is available for most e-reader bookshops. The source files for the book (full text) and the configuration files are freely available on GitHub.
 It has been great working on this project with help of the community. I hope this project can attract some new Emacs users.
 Next step is an enhanced second edition and publish a paperback version.

 I like eMacs diff, so I open the file in .c_path and do ediff-buffers so I can review my changes. This requires opening the file, positioning the original file on the left, updated file on the right and then m-x edify-buffers. I have set ediff-split-window-function to split-window-sensibly
 I do this often, so I would love to automate this workflow. I’m not sure how to begin though - any suggestions?

  '(package-archives (quote ( ("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") ("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") ) )) 
 Commenting out the "gnu" line seems to make the loading error go away, but then there are tons of packages I can't install, I guess because their dependencies are in the gnu repository.
 This is on "GNU Emacs 28.2 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2022-09-13".
 Any ideas? Any pointers for where I might look for clues about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using evil for a few years but it never really "clicked" and I only ever used the main keybindings. I'm trying out Meow, since hopefully it will be more configurable, and the object-verb structure might be easier for me, and I like that you don't have to define your own separate keybindings for every new package.
 I'm wondering if there are any guides for setting up leader-key and local-leader stuff with meow? I know that keypad mode is great for entering normal keybindings without cords, but I'm wondering how to add special keybindings to keypad mode?
  
Is there a way to have a "local-leader" key, like "," which is the equivalent of doing "C-c", so I can have a separate way to input mode-specific commands?
 How can I bind specific commands to key sequences in keypad/leader mode? e.g. I want "SPC SPC" to be like M-x, "SPC b b" to bring up the buffer menu, "SPC w d" to delete a window, etc. How can I do this kind of specific bindings for local-leader commands? But for everything I haven't defined, I want to default to the usual meow-keypad stuff.
 Are there any configs/packages that are like evil-surround? Or embrace configs for meow?
 Are there any meow configs for LaTeX mode, for e.g. surrounding in commands and such?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to ask this question in a language-agnostic way here, and I'm actually using ReScript (a dialect of OCaml focused on the JavaScript ecosystem). But since the Haskell community probably has more experience with recursion schemes, I'm also asking here.
 In short, I'm writing a multi-stage compiler for a toy language, and I want to simplify folding and transforming my ASTs.
 Recursion schemes are perfect for this, but to use them I need to first "functorialize" my AST type, and then recover the concrete type by wrapping it into Fix. In ReScript syntax it looks like this:
 // "Functorialized" AST to allow recursion schemes inject custom data in place of nodes type exprF<'a> = Id(string) | Int(int) | Call(exprF<'a>, exprF<'a>) // Concrete expression type of arbitrary depth. // We add an extra wrapper to avoid defining it like 'type expr = exprF<expr>', // which would be self-referential and rejected by the compiler. type rec expr = Fix(exprF<expr>) 
 The problem is, of course, that I now need to insert that Fix wrapper everywhere when constructing expressions or pattern-matching on them:
 let testData = Fix(Call( Fix(Id("square")), Fix(Int(5)) ) 
 Is there a way to avoid doing this, or at least automate it? Does it require specific language features, like Haskell's HKTs or OCaml's [@@unboxed]?
 I'd appreciate any thoughts! There is a full example of defining a catamorphism recursion scheme in my linked post.

One feature that's unique to the Shapeless variant is the ability to convert a type to a string. If that's going to be removed, is there a more canonical way to do it in Scala 3? I haven't seen a way to do it with mirrors, but maybe I haven't looked hard enough. Rolling my own solution with macros is of course one somewhat cumbersome possibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have something on the order of 120 RSS/atom feeds for blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels. Since I started using Elfeed a few years ago, I've use cURL (i.e. had elfeed-use-curl set to t) as the feed-fetching function, but despite various tweaks (including some suggested here) updating elfeed always took at least 2 minutes, on average something like 4 minutes. And it would be quite resource intensive: CPU usage would jump up and my laptop fans would immediately start whirring.
    
 Recently, I tried to debug an issue relating to a podcast feed that kept failing to update, no matter how long I set elfeed-curl-timeout. I'd get the error (56) Failure in receiving network data. Going to a terminal and manually downloading the feed with cURL worked fine.
    
 I decided to switch elfeed-use-curl to nil to see if something was an issue. And incredibly, I found that the troublesome feed almost instantly updated. Updating all my feeds took a lot longer with much less resource usage.
    
 So ... is there possibly something else going on here, or is cURL less performant than url-retrieve, at least for large numbers of feeds? Can anyone else verify this?

 My use case for it has been to keep track of token positions in buffers and efficiently determine the context for which to provide code intelligence. I needed an efficient data-structure that accommodates for localized "hot" access zones and doesn't use an insane amount of memory.

 let's assume T is an arbitrary case class with the attributes in Super and I want to be able to mutate those 3 fields in Foo.foo (by creating new instances with the mutated field). Assume I'm not in control of Super (it comes from a 3-rd party lib).
 Is there any way I can use the copy method available in case classes to mutate those 3 attributes? I have read copy is something the scala compiler creates on the fly and it is not really possible to override (doesn't come from Product or anything else). Any reasonable alternative to copy (or any way I can use copy?
 I thought about an implicit class over Super and adding a method to mutate it via copy, but it being a trait it does not have a copy method. I could create a new instance of Super with one or more of the fields mutated (as in new Super {...}), but that would force me to down-cast to one of the child case classes right after.

Last week suddenly the completions became unusably slow on Windows. It stutters after every character. Completely unusable. This is now an issue with both Rust and C++ projects. Seems to be independent of the project size, as small projects are just as bad. Everything is fine on Linux.
 I am guessing it is some update, or some silly change in the environment. Anyone have any ideas? I tried updating packages, I upgraded to Emacs 29.4, updating windows. Nothing helped. Any suggestions for fixing this are super appreciated!

 If you ever need to use geographical points (with latitude and longitude) directly as keys you need to start playing some games as coordinates are floats, besides you sometimes want to aggregate with a certain resolution but later you may need a different one.
 I want to use modern libraries, and all the benefits of Scala 3, ergonomic is important too. I love the fact that Latitudes and Longitudes can not be swapped accidentally and all those little things.
 My biggest concern right now is that there many pieces (neotype, squats, Scalaz, even Cats) and maybe this can be simplified using Zio Prelude.
 It can be found here https://github.com/sisamon/geodesy_scala_3
 And this is the beginning of it, if you do not mind taking a look and providing some feedback I will appreciate it!

 https://sake92.github.io/squery/index.html
 How is it different from others?
  
raw SQL with a string interpolator, thin layer above JDBC, no DSLs
 synchronous only, no Future/IO/F[_] stuff
 context function used to propagate connection/transaction
 handling results is name-based unlike some other libraries. So you don't have to do tuples and _1, _2.. easy to make mistakes 
 composition is used for JOINs, so it’s much easier to extract the values
 has some nice helper functions for mapping flat results to structured objects
 
 has a code generator for table rows and CRUD DAOs. Very quick to get started
  
Mostly inspired by https://index.scala-lang.org/jodersky/simplesql and Doobie of course.

 I can do a regex-search for typ[^e] but when I use that, the fourth character is captured, thus a replace C-s M-r Typ[^e] M-% Typ will erroneouly replace typId as Typd (deleting the [I]) as it is captured.
 Without lookahead, behind, what is the Emacs way?

I set up a new machine this week and noticed org mode now has a directory called org-persist, but I can't find any docs telling me whether this should go under source control or not.
 So, does anyone know if I should be storing org-persist in source control?

as well as using remote build execution (RBE) to offload builds to a remote
build farm. Our customers are interested in leveraging RBE to improve developer
experience and reduce continuous integration (CI) run times, giving us an
opportunity to learn all aspects of deploying different RBE solutions. I would
like to share how one can deploy one of them, Buildbarn, and
secure all communications in it.

What is it and why do we care?
We want developers to be productive. Being productive requires spending as
little time as possible waiting for build/test feedback, not having to switch
to a different task while the build is running.

One part of achieving this is to never build the same thing twice. Tools like

 This approach uses extensible types, a design pattern based on higher kinds, and makes it possible to replace any portion of a value of an algebraic datatype with a logic variable. Here's the abstract:

 (which-key-setup-minibuffer))
 I can set up key bindings for instances using 
 (leader-key "dtm" '(display-time-mode :which-key "display-time-mode"))
 and this works fine .
 But I am trying to define a function which takes two inputs such as the key-bind and the associated command, and set up the key-bind and assign it to which key. Here is my code 
 (defun my-keybind (kb command)
 (leader-key kb command :which-key (symbol-name command)))
 and want to use
 (my-keybind "dtm" 'display-time-mode)
 But the function is not working, I am not quite sure how to fix it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is probably only relevant to maybe 2 or 3 people, but I figured I'd post here in case it's one of you.
 I recently rediscovered a small major mode that I had written a while back for dealing with PCGen LST files. This is the data format for PCGen, an open source project similar to HeroLab for building TTRPG characters. At the time, I had to input data for some content that wasn't available yet, and I wrote a major mode to make it easier to deal with.
 If anyone is interested, I can pop it up on github to share. It's pretty basic - a little bit of keyword highlighting, custom forward/backward -sexp functions, and setting up sane defaults to deal with essentially a TSV file with very long lines.It could almost certainly be expanded/improved, but it got the job done for me at the time.
 Anyhow, if you're interested, let me know and I'll make it available.

 I am new to Emacs, and I frequently forget keybindings, so I often need to search for them by describing what they do. I use C-h d (apropos-documentation) for this purpose, but I find that searching on Google for specific tasks is usually faster. For example, when I was trying to find the mark-whole-buffer command using keywords like "mark all region," I couldn't find the information I needed. Instead I was getting a big chunk of irrelevant documentation. Am I using the approach incorrectly? 
 I would appreciate hearing about your experience.

I thought it would be possible to have an input mode in emacs that emulate input mode in software like Finale, Sibelius, and so on, but writing LilyPond code. For instance, when in this mode, numbers select the duration, enter enters a note with this duration. Arrows up and down increase or decrease a half tone, etc. What do you think? Anybody interested?

 EDIT: I'm using clangd and this is where it's broken. I tested with a Rust buffer using rust-analyzer and it works.
 SOLVED: I just replaced clangd with ccls and it works.

 The default face uses a monospaced font which is the same returned by (frame-parameter nil 'font), so minibuffer messages aren't using either the default face or frame's default one.
 Where is the face for minibuffer messages stored? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-drill for spaced repetition drilling, and often when doing a review session, during a question I think of something I'd like to follow up on later. Maybe add a new question, or investigate something related, or...whatever. Just some note to do later.
 The drill mode is extremely agressive about capturing all keystrokes, so if it's waiting for the user to hit a key and then ask me how well I did, I really can't do anything else with emacs. And of course I want to make these notes in emacs, and not switch over to some other editor like some kind of barbarian. :)
 Is there any way I can escape or bypass or otherwise allow myself to make notes during a drill session? 
 Ideally, I'd like something where the drill session only "takes over" the relevant buffer, but still allows other windows and for the user to switch to/from the drill buffer/session.
 Then I could have two windows, one with my drill session running, and during the session if I think of a note, I switch to the other buffer, make my note, and switch back and do more drill stuff.
 EDIT: as /u/queyenth points out, just doing e from the drill prompt lets you escape out of the drill prompt. The idea is to edit the question, but you can do off and do whatever you like, and then just do org-drill-resume and it, well, resumes exactly where you left off.
 So, the solution is: when I'm looking at a drill question and my ADHD brain spews a bunch of related things and I need to get them out of my head or I'll forget them:
  
Do e, which org-drill says means "edit" but to me means "escape the very agressive drill prompt".
 
Make notes, play Tetris, deflect cosmic rays to flip bits on my hard drive, etc.
 
Do org-drill-resume.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To my understanding and for my use case, vscode-json-languageserver seems to be the most promising language server.
 According to the link, the language server supports formatting, renaming, completion using JSON Schema. Eglot seems to follow a conservative approach concerning LS features and none seems to work out of the box.
 For example when I open the Eglot menu, Find definitions, find references, Find type definiton all is greyed out.
 If point is on a sympol and I call M-x eglot-rename I am prompted to rename the identifier but after RET I get the error eglot--error: [eglot] Unsupported or ignored LSP capability `:renameProvider'
 I didn't configure Eglot at all. I am also using the gopls LS for Golang development, didn't configure anything either and featuers "just work". Not so for vscode-json-languageserver. Here is my init.el
 Does anyone have a working example how Eglot needs to be configured to use at least a subset of this LS features?

 Ran the profiler a bunch of times, tried disabling modes, opened larger and smaller files, went through the git log, installed different versions of Emacs, switched machines and tried some other things. After two days of frustration, I noticed the problem worsening. As it turns out, a minuscule speck of dust was lodged in my key-well. Blast it! With Emacs, there's almost always some bizarre shit, and the immediate knee-jerk reaction to anything unusual is to assume that it's broken. Emacs is good, and Emacs is never broken (unless when it is 😀).
 Talk about confirmation bias.

 To tackle a few common questions:
  
Yes, Anduril is an American defense technology company. We build weapons systems for the United States and its allies.
 
This is a _Haskell_ role. It is not a bait and switch. We are writing applications in GHC Haskell, not some homegrown Haskell-like language or some other programming language. That said, knowledge of C, Rust, or Typescript would be a valuable differentiating factor, as we often rub elbows with codebases that use these languages as well.
 
This is an on-site role at Anduril headquarters in Costa Mesa, California. Our team is building software for hardware products, so physical presence in our RF lab is often required throughout the course of software development and testing. Remote work would only be considered for candidates with something extraordinary to offer to our team.
 
 I'd be happy to answer any other questions in the thread below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
Am new to the method, so naturally am still exploring its intents and purposes. I've decided to start using it for my research on courses about machine learning applied to geology, machine learning itself or geology itself. I'm used to writing stuff down linearly in my paper notebook - not only am accostumed to it, but I also feel pretty good doing so. It makes more sense to me, I guess, to jolt down in a notebook something thorough and linear as a course, more sense than writing atomic notes at least. I'm not sure if I'm "stuck to the hold habits" or that's actually somewhat the way to go. I wanted to try Zettelkasten to be more dynamic in my note-writing, as well as faster - for as much as I like and absorb better on paper, I roughly take one hour per page. Insanity.
My "notes" in my notebook are more of a summary of the thing I am consuming than simplified notes per se; I like to make them so that when I need to check the subject in the future once it is forgotten, I will be able to quickly comprehend it again. Which is why I am feeling using the notebook, rather than Zettelkasten, makes more sense.
Or perhaps I can make atomic notes on the subject and link them on an "index" of some sort in my Zettelkasten? An index such as "Course X/Y/Z" with the individual atomic notes?
Thanks for any input.]]></summary>

It allows you to create correct SQL queries during compilation and display them to the user. I originally started this project because there is essentially no runtime overhead compared to the database driver. Although this approach has its problems, such as increased compilation time and sometimes the need to move code to different modules due to stage restrictions. However, I think this is an interesting approach that is worth considering.

 I kinda miss Scala a bit though so thinking of coming back after several nearly 4 years long break. It looks like a lot has changed.
 What libraries/ecosystems are y'all using these days? What's popular for HTTP, Database, etc? Back in my day, Doobie and Cats with http4s were considered cool. I'm wondering what's changed.
 I also completely missed out Scala 3 and the transition. Where are we with that now? Is it still true that a lot of people still use Scala 2?

Ironically the problem is that it does its job just fine! everything is already done, all plugins I can need now or in the future are well configured.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Zettelkasten has been around for about 2.5 years now. After about six months, I had the idea of tidying up the Zettelkasten for the first time. Somehow it bothered me that parts of the box looked very tidy, while others looked quite chaotic.
Initially, my activities to improve this situation were still very sporadic and unsystematic. I lacked a ‘method for tidying up’. But it wasn't so easy to find. Even my favourite source ‘How to take smart notes’ by Sönke Ahrens didn't help me.
Why don't I use Marie Kondo's method? She already helps me tidy up my socks. Why can't she also improve the situation in my Zettelkasten ? Thought, done: Since 14 May 2023 (create date, Zettelkasten), I have been tidying up using the method.
But I can do even better. Today, while I was tidying up my Zettelkasten, I was offered the note ‘Simplicity’. And Google was kind enough to point me to ‘The Five Elements’ within Feng Shui via ‘The Principle of Clarity’.
And yes, Feng Shui has been identified by scientists and philosophers as both non-scientific and pseudoscientific, and has been described as a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience. But it has helped me to find a different way of looking at my Zettelkasten. Looking at WOOD, FIRE, EARTH, METAL and WATER makes new connections that were invisible without this framework.
I also added "The Five Principles" which helped me to find the right balance to tidy up my Zettelkasten.

  
What experiences have you had? What is the best way to tidy up a Zettelkasten?]]></summary>

 It is my understanding that if you have the javafx dependencies declared in your pom.xml file then it should work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Emacs for all my (rather limited) text editing and bash scripting needs for years, and am finally getting round to seriously learning c++, partly thanks to the excitement in recent years over things like lsp-mode, eglot and tree-sitter. 
 A quick search through this sub, however, shows frustrated posts every couple of years over emacs' performance as a c++ ide. My (perhaps optimistic) suspicion is that it'll be more than sufficient for my purposes, given that I'm a long way off from million line codebases and so on, so I probably won't need or want full ide functionality for a while. 
 So, assuming that my needs are fairly simplistic, is it reasonable as a beginner programmer learning c++ to be using emacs for (more-or-less) my entire learning environment, or am I missing out in ways I don't yet understand? I currently have pdf-tools for reading a textbook in one fullscreen frame on one monitor, and then 2 windows side-by-side on another monitor - the cpp file (or header or makefile or whatever) I'm editing on one side, and the other side for the output of M-x compile (which I've bound to C-c c) or a M-x shell (bound to C-c s).
 I would love some recommendations for things that I don't yet know I'll want. For example, syntax highlighting in c++-mode seems good enough so far - do I want to be using c++-ts? If so, is the grammar on the tree-sitter github page the one to use? Do I want ide style features like symbol/definition navigation, corrections, reformatting, completion as you type? Any suggestions for configs focused on those sorts of features? I'm not a fan of big starter kits like doom, but would love to read other people's configs for things that I can apply myself.
 I know this is all a bit vague, so apologies for that. I guess I don't really know what I'm looking for, which is sort of the point. Many thanks for reading this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context
 I am writing a client library for NATS topic based messaging. I am trying to define the API implementation through which to interact with the library, along with the data structure of the client. The client will need to 
  
read from a socket to fetch messages (this can be a single sync thread)
 
accept async requests to write messages to the socket, along with updating the client's topic router
 
 Question
 I initially started implementing this functionality using the state monad, however this will cause problems as soon as async requests occur (e.g. one thread will be updating the client's read messages into a buffer, another will be updating the topic router, overwriting the former changes)
 There appears to be a library for concurrent state, this feels like it could be a solution for my problem, but I wanted to check with those more experienced in Haskell - does this approach make sense, or am I missing a more simple solution? I assume adding more granular concurrency control over each resource would be lead to a more efficient, but more complicated implementation, so I'd prefer simple for the time being.
 TL;DR
 If I want a data structure that has 'mutable' state, that will be accessed across threads/async, does the concurrent state library make the most sense?
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm trying to configure a Literate DevOps workflow using Org Mode in Emacs. My goal is to dynamically insert a password, retrieved via password-store-get, into a shell script. However, when I use the noweb syntax <<>> in my shell block, it just inserts the Emacs Lisp code instead of the evaluated result.
 Here's what I have so far:
 ```
 +name: get-passwd
 +begin_src emacs-lisp
 (password-store-get "my-pass-store/postgres/pass")
 +end_src
 +begin_src shell :shebang "#!/usr/bin/env bash" :tangle /ssh:remote-host|sudo:deploy@remote-host:postgres/secret-secret.sh :noweb yes
 export DB_PASSWORD=<<get-passwd>> podman secret create --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD DB_PASSWORD
 +end_src
 ```
 When I tangle this, the generated script still contains the function call instead of the actual password:
 ``` bash
 !/usr/bin/env bash
 export DB_PASSWORD=(password-store-get "my-pass-store/postgres/pass") podman secret create --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD DB_PASSWORD ```
 I’d like the script to include the actual password rather than the function. Does anyone know how I can achieve this? Any tips or simpler solutions would be greatly appreciated!

 Pressing ^C once does not seem to do anything, and a second ^C kills the binary and produces an empty .prof file. What am I missing? 
 For context, here the relevant part of my cabal.project.local file:
 profiling: True profiling-detail: all-functions 
 And I use the following options for all components of my cabal package:

 as well as the +RTS -p -RTS CLI option.

 I dont exaclty know what i may need to re-enable in future so is there a way to get do above and tackle this problem as well. I hope someone already have done this in their config

I thought creating one would be a good first large project to do in Haskell. I'm looking for some direction on which libraries would be good to use - for rendering the text, communicating with pty/tty etc. One feature that is a must-have is having a real GUI textfield for inputing commands that works well with a mouse, allows selecting text and so on.
 I was thinking of using the Haskell bindings to Dear IMGUI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using emms with mpv, is there any way to get rid of duplicate music track notifications in gnome?
 I use emms with mpv as the player. It all works great. My only little issue is that in the gnome panel I always have two notifications of the current track. I run emacsclient and on startup that creates a notification automatically before running emms that just says "unknown title." Then when I play emms, I get a notification that indicates the track and has a thumbnail, and a second duplicate notification, except without a thumbnail.
 I have tried turning off notifications in gnome settings for both emacs and for mpv and that has no effect.
 I am using Pop!_22.04 with gnome 42.9 and emacs 28. The relevant part of my emms config is the following:
  
(require 'emms-setup)
 (require 'emms-mpris)
 (emms-all)
 (emms-default-players)
 (emms-mpris-enable)
 (setq emms-player-list '(emms-player-mpv))
 (setq emms-source-file-default-directory "~/Music/")
 (setq emms-info-functions '(emms-info-tinytag))
 (setq emms-browser-covers 'emms-browser-cache-thumbnail-async)
 (setq emms-playing-time-display-mode nil)
  
I know this might really be a gnome issue. But I have searched and got no answers so I thought I'd try here. Rhythmbox also shows duplicate notifications, though both have thumbnails. The only music player I've tried that has just one notification with a nice thumbnail seems to be Lollypop.

For the past few months, I've taken a lot of reference notes on 4x6 cards ranging from Coursera courses, academic journals to books and even my own daily journal.
After converting them into main notes for 3 weeks, I now have a question, which is hilarious but did bother me a lot. The question is how should I sequence my reference note cards for a course or a book because I might have notes on two cards for 2 chapters or for a combination of different lesson videos.
I watch some YouTube videos, but it looks like no one have talked about sequencing of reference note cards?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title. Rather than executing the expected org-move-subtree-up, M-k does nothing. All the other directional keys work as expected with M. M-UP also works as expected. When looking at the Messages buffer, M-k produces no messages when operating on regular paragraphs, but when used on headings (and only headings) it produces this:
 Invalid face attribute :foreground nil [x times]
 The number of times increments anywhere from 20-40+ on each input of M-k. I am currently using DOOM Emacs, and have tried completely removing all Emacs files and then reinstalling multiple times with no luck. This has been a problem for several months now, and after looking on the internet and finding nothing of use, I decided I would finally post a question here.
 System: Ubuntu Studio 23.10 running on a Thinkpad P15 Gen 2i
 Please let me know any other information that would be useful to solving this. I am an Emacs newbie, so be kind.
 EDIT: Current troubleshooting data
  
Problem persists on both X and Wayland
 Problem persists when all packages except evil-org are removed
 C-h k M-<up> returns expected information on org-metaup. Similar results for other directional keys 
 M-k is listed as an alternate keybinding
 
 C-h k M-k returns nothing. It seems that M-k never makes it to Emacs 
 This is strange, as M-k does produce text in the Messages buffer when used on headings
 M-k also causes the mode line to flash, if pressed repeatedly
 
 On my other system, running Artix and i3, this problem does not present

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I am new to this forum and Zettelkasten. Do I take literature notes on permanent notes in my case? If not, how to convert literature notes into permanent notes?
Today I was reading the book Atomic Habits on my iPad in the kindle app and there was an option to take notes on a specific line/word in the book. I read about 20-25 pages and marked a lot of information (there is an option - I can mark lines and words in blue, red, orange and yellow colors). So, as I was reading I took a lot of literature notes in the app (in total 15-20) and it was not one note that contained all the literature notes. I wrote all these notes with my own words and I noticed that I was describing some ideas very differently but the essence remained the same and I referred to what the author wanted to convey, but in different words. And sometimes I even supplemented these ideas with my own thoughts.
Now I am using Obsidian and wrote down these ideas from my iPad to my computer in Obsidian as literature notes. Some of them were similar, so I filtered them out. But I do not think these are literature notes. They seem like permanent notes. In my case, when I make such notes, are they permanent or literature notes? And sorry for my bad English. If I made any mistakes, please correct me. I will be very grateful for any answer!]]></summary>

 It integrates with use-package and straight so transitioning is surprisingly easy, for me at least. And now that I have transitioned, I can try packages quickly and easily, and best of all without stalling my session.
 Thanks very much u/nv-elisp, not only did he write elpaca, he's also been really active on reddit, I came across many of his comments answering peoples questions when I was looking into switching to elpaca.

 I added a new design, with the title on the left. Let me know what you think and if you have any feedback/ideas on usability/features that you think would be important for the first release and I'll try to incorporate it before releasing.
 Added a corfu (and corfu-popupinfo) mode, inspired by Manueljlin's if emacs was made by zoomers post. Will try to move the icons on the title bar instead of 'Corfu' before releasing.
 BTW any package name ideas?

 I do most of my development locally and test on a remote machine, where TRAMP is simply too slow for code intelligence and responsiveness. To improve this, I am sharing a mode for asynchronous file syncing using `unison`. I did so after trying several other similar approaches, including ones based on rsync (https://github.com/r-zip/rsync-mode).
 My solution is probably due to specifics of secure compute environments managed by coder, but it works well for me, and should be general purpose. Hope someone finds it useful, too!

So I wrote a small wrapper script over scala-cli/GraalVM which reuses the compiled binary it detects that the script content hasn't changed.
 https://github.com/jatcwang/instant-scala
 The script quite bare-bones as I'm hoping that scala-cli will have first-class support for this in the future. But meanwhile hope this can help someone else too :)

 If I pin emacs to the dash and open it by clicking there it does receive focus (emacs and emacs (client)). Double-clicking the binary directly in the file explorer and running emacs in the terminal both similarly give focus.
 I've searched for a bit online and the closest I've seen to this exact problem is this: (link) (although this: (link) suggests someone has the same problem).
 One thing to note: this problem only occurs under Wayland proper. When under X11 (Xwayland), emacs gets focus correctly (my machine switches if I enable/disable hybrid graphics and reboot). 
  
 Given what I've found, I think it's clear the problem is something with Wayland and xdg-activation or whatever it is, meaning it's probably something I can't solve. But just in case, has anyone had this problem and figured out a workaround (other than just launching emacs any other way)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm know I'm asking this at a Scala channel but I'm counting on those who have experience/knowledge on both Scala and other FP languages. The intention is not to start a flamewar with things like x is definitively better than y, but just actual facts to understand where Scala sits compared to the other FP languages. I'm not a FP expert. I did a few things here and there, but for sure I don't have solid foundations to take my own conclusions, yet.
 I would say that the reason I'm asking this is due to some comments I saw at the r/haskell. The main points were:
  
The mix between OO and FP. To some degree I find this odd as well and I still don't see the value of it.
 How Scala had and still do lots of compromises because it's so dependent on the JVM which has a totally different model. 
 Overall complexity of the language. I would say that this is better at Scala 3, but still, I find the language really, really hard.
 How easy it is to start mixing up functional and non functional code which defeats the whole purpose of writing the functional code. OCaml suffers from this as well, but I would say that is way harder to do the same on Haskell or Erlang.
  
Thanks!

Recently, I've been looking for a solution to more fully integrate my ZK with my daily journaling, planning, and task management.  I came close to finding that in NotePlan, which I loved and have used for about three years.  It did a great job of integrating everything except my ZK, which I maintained in The Archive.  The hump there was that NotePlan used a somewhat different file format from The Archive (both used text files, but in different ways).  I was slowly trying to build up steam to write a Python script to convert from one format to the other, and due to other priorities, I didn't get to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hydrogen Framework for Emacs:
 https://codeberg.org/joe-adams/hydrogen
 Hydrogen is a very small framework that aims to make Emacs easier to use for people who are used to text editors other than Emacs or Vi. It gives you modern keybindings, improves the behavior of tabs and windows and a few other things.
 Some highlights:
  
Under 200k, including comments, the GPL, etc.
 The actual code is under 30k.
 No external packages, does not impose a package manager on you.
 Composed of several features that can individually be activated or deactivated.
 Modern keybindings 
 C-c for copy, C-a for select all, etc.
 
 Tab is just tab if no text is selected.
 Generally stops Emacs from opening new tabs when you open new buffers
 Closes windows when you close the last tab
 Dired doesn't new buffers when you navigate to new directories.
 A splash screen
 Heavily commented code base
 Code says the default values of settings that are changed.
  
Please let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions. Please consider recommending Hydrogen to any new Emacs users you know.

However, when I created an .hs file and tried to run it in vscode, it's telling me that hls 2.9.0.1 is needed to be installed. I went on GHCup tui and it said it already had hls 2.7.0.0 installed. I also tried letting vscode just install the hls 2.9.0.1 but it's not working (likely it's not linked to GHCup?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[look closely behind the headings
 Yup. I have transparency set. Awesome feature that motivates me to use emacs more often
 But this looked kinda annoying in org mode (the gray asterisks behind the stars). I know that the non-leading stars are colored so that it would blend with the background, but now that the background is no longer a solid color, the asterisks look like this.
 either i'm gonna make it so that the headings are gonna indicate its level by its size instead of its position, or i'll find a workaround to completely hide the stars with spaces or an invisible character. any advice?

 I was trying to use the appimage version, to get a newer version of emacs (29.4 instead of 27.something). I successfully added it to path, and doom recognized it and rebuilt my packages, but then I got this. Vanilla emacs works fine. The picture shows all errors.

 I know about org-clock-in/out, but I'm using column-view and I need to record the inactive timestamp that are logged to the LOGBOOK drawer, so I can use the TIMESTAMP_IA special property.
 My goal is to record the amount of time studied between my study sessions, so other suggestions are welcome.

Sorry for the wall of text, I don't know how to phrase it better. How do I make it so doom emacs (no evil mode) starts exactly how I closed it without having to go through scattered config files? I don't wanna mess it up. What I really want is to start with the last file used open and it's folder on treemacs, and a little terminal open with my zsh config. Also, how do I open another buffer with a file I double-clicked on treemacs? I have no idea what to do then and I'm afraid of deleting it. I loved emacs so far and want to learn more about it after finishing this, as I'm pretty satisfied already.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After I invoke org capture to create a journal entry, the cursor is position at the start of the entry, prior to the timestamp, instead of after it. In other words, as soon as the capture is done, I cannot start writing the entry, but have to move the cursor to the end of the line before I can start typing. Why does it happen?
 The following is what I have in my configuration for org-capture-templates.
  ("j" "Journal entry" plain (function org-journal-find-location) "** %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)\n%?" :empty-lines 2 :jump-to-captured t :immediate-finish t) 
 where org-journal-find-location is defined as follows.
  (defun org-journal-find-location () ;; Open today's journal, but specify a non-nil prefix argument in order to ;; inhibit inserting the heading; org-capture will insert the heading. (org-journal-new-entry t) (unless (eq org-journal-file-type 'daily) (org-narrow-to-subtree)) (goto-char (point-max))) 
 These are based on the example snippets from org-journal repository.
 I thought the use of "%?" following the newline should force the cursor to be placed after the headline (containing the timestamp), but it does not. What am I overlooking?

But, again and again, i feel like my Emacs configuration reaches a point where it starts to feel "fragile". I've been working on mine on and off for some time now and, in general, i really like where i'm at.
 But the i try adding in Treemacs and it's a hassle to make that change. Just adding it in with use-package results in "treemacs loaded before elpaca". So, `:ensure (:wait t)` seems to solve that. Now treemacs works. As soon as i add a `:bind` to the setup, the treemacs buffer opens empty and i get `Error in post-command-hook (treemacs--post-command): (wrong-type-argument markerp nil)`. Without keybind it's fine. This is just one example.
 I look around and see really elaborate configurations with major customizations that seem to work flawlessly for those people. But for me, it quickly reaches a point where things start behaving differently from what i would expect.
 I'm close to starting over (again) as i feel that i've lost control over that configuration. And i don't even know why.

 Would this be the right place to get feedback on the style of the code? I am kind of shy about showing my code to the world without feedback.

 If I don't mark the methods in ZipTag inline, it works, but then I suppose the tuple is traversed at runtime. Is this a fundamental limitation, or can it be worked around? It seems like it should be possible in theory, since all the information is available compile-time.

 When I M-: evaluating auto-revert-mode it is 'nil'
 When I change outside of Emacs a file which is visted by an Emacs buffer, the file is not auto-reverted. When I try to edit that buffer, Emacs warns that the file has been changed outside of Emacs, so I don't lose content. However the buffer is not visually updated.
 How can I check if reverting should actually work? Or do I missunderstand auto-reverting of buffers in Emacs?

 I'm really excited to announce the release of Dunai 0.13.1 and Bearriver 0.14.10!
 Dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. Dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants.
 Dunai comes with:
  
bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 
dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.
 
 See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai#features for details on Dunai's features.
 This release fixes an issue with the dependency on the list-transformer library as an alternative to transformers. Thanks to @ tomsmeding for the contribu…]]></summary>

 This is a freshly compiled Emacs, ran with -Q and rust-mode + eglot, nothing more. You can see on the screenshot that the minibuffer shows only the first line of eldoc (C-h .) - it cuts the rest off even though max-mini-window-height isn't the problem. I want it to also include the second line with the type information (I want it because I hate inlay-hints and I turn them off). I spent some time doing research and I found this package https://github.com/emacsmirror/eglot-signature-eldoc-talkative that seems to be related but it didn't do what I wanted. Based on it I tried to do some things but honestly I'm a pretty bad Emacs user and I have no idea what I'm doing.

But this journey also became one of very personal development as I continue to find additional productivity techniques, psychological insights, etc. that are helping me be a better me. And the ZK method seems well suited for also keeping track of those things.
Is there some wisdom in keeping the things separate? Or do you just let it all live together?
What about journaling? I ask that because my "personal development" stuff can veer closer to "journaling" than "business research," but journaling (and dream journaling) feels like it shouldn't be anywhere near my ZK.]]></summary>

 Is there a way to highlight the active window by coloring the border like in many tilling window managers (here i3 from a random video on yt)
 All the solutions I found are about changing the color of the background / modeline. I don't want to change the background (auto-dim-other-buffers.el do the job) and I already have a dynamic modeline color but it's not enough for me to quickly see where i am.
 (I use Doom emacs with default doom-theme if it can help)

 1. Install Emacs and AUCTeX
  
Emacs: Download and install Emacs from [GNU Emacs]() or use your package manager if you're on Linux.
 AUCTeX: Install AUCTeX through Emacs' package manager: 
 Open Emacs and type M-x package-refresh-contents RET.
 Then, install AUCTeX with M-x package-install RET auctex RET.
 
  
2. Install ConTeXt LMTX
  
Download ConTeXt LMTX from the [Pragma ADE website]().
 Extract the archive and place the folder in a location of your choice.
  
This is what I did and it seems that AUCTex is installed.
 however, I dont know where to go from here, do i need anything else? is there a way to get started with making ConTeXt work on emacs? I have the context-win64 folder in C:\ConTeXt\context-win64 as I was instructed in the directions to make a folder for win64

Swimming with Ideas
This is yet another opportunity to share what you are working on with your friends here on the forum. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I'd love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Here is my report on why I'm here and my current ZK work themes and ideas:
Exploring feminism as a man.
Working on the concept of creating thinking canvases.
I'm thinking a lot about automation.
I'm back in university for the semester and taking a journalism writing class with a bunch of young people.
Thinking about the "Theory of Maximum Taste" and how to apply it to note-taking.
My reading is very much related to reading and writing.
Books I'm reading or read this week:
Adler, Mortimer Jerome and Van Doren, Charles Lincoln. How to read a book. 2014.[[202407311603]]
Fadiman, Anne. Ex Libris: Confessions of a Common Reader. Unabridged, Recorded Books, 1999. Audiobook Everand
Blundell, William E. The Art and Craft of Feature Writing: Based on the Wall Street Journal Guide. New American Library, 1988.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all comint infrastructure is a thing that powers M-x shell and M-x run-python and probably other things that im not aware of.
 Its a nice thing because you can use it as a framework to make your shell or repl or interpreter more interactive in very standard emacsy way, by communicating with external processes.
 It gives you code completion (using *Completions* buffer), syntax highlighting (according to the article below), and it can pass those code completion candidates to normal emacs buffer.
 Run M-x run-python, create a new buffer with python-mode, AND you will have context aware code completion in your buffer (try it)
 BUT it does NOT give you code navigation, cause it doesn't integrate with xref, and it's not a full terminal emulator.
 I read the source code of comint.el, python.el, shell.el and found this brilliant article: https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/comint-writing-command-interpreter
 Main problem (besides xref), that i have with comint is that it is dumb terminal (as opposed to xterm-256color terminal), meaning it isn't a full terminal emulator.
 It doesn't interpret ANSI escape sequences, essentially only supporting raw input and output.
 So my question is: Why is that? And how do i fix that?
 To be clear emacs does have full terminal emulators like vterm or ansi-term.
 But i think it would be awesome to have those advantages that comint already has and also have a perfect development environment for creating tui programs.
 I hope this post doesn't feel like a rant or is unclear. I'm interested in emacs architecture design, and want to learn from it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: as u/mickeyp pointed out, inhibiting annotations for remote files is the solution. Luckily, this is the default in marginalia, so no manual advices are needed if I use that :)
 Sorry for bad formatting, I'm blaming the android app.
 I've recently had the pain of working with tramp over a slow connection and noticed that minibuffer completion during find-file on a remote path was painfully slow, constanly freezing, and sometimes triggered forbidden reentrant calls.
 I put my poor emacs debugging skills to the task and noticed a large number of test -e ... commands going through tramp, coming from a large number of calls to file-exists-p on remote paths triggered by the completion (was using fido at the time). This seems to hurt other completion packages that are based around completing-read from what I could tell (tested a bit with vertico).
 I tried ido instead and it was blazingly fast in comparison. I couldn't find anything about this through basic googling so thought I'd ask here: I see vertico and friends being recommended here a lot, and while I generally prefer these alternatives over ido, not playing nice with tramp is a pretty big pain point. Anyone has any workaround or config tips to tackle this that don't involve applying super deep advices?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I'd like to invite you all to next episode of Scala Space Podcast on Friday 23rd at 2PM CEST. My guest this time will be the creator of Scala himself - Martin Odersky. We will try to discuss and explain all the whats and whys of Lean Scala, of Scala features and how things could look like in the future. The podcast will be streamed live on YouTube and Twitch so you can join and comment or ask questions in the chat, as usual.

 YouTube: https://youtube.com/live/IugW666w-M8
 Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/averagefpenjoyer/schedule?segmentID=fb6fafda-ad50-4f1b-b06d-37f44f722b25
 P.S.: I'm trying to figure out RSS (this is a bit simpler) and Apple podcasts + Spotify podcasts by popular demand, it's just painfully slow due to everything being very legalese.
 P.S.2: I got rid of the boom arm and my microphone will be positioned centrally so there should be no more issues with my audio being skewed towards the left channel (I do read YouTube comments!).
 P.S.3: you can also write your questions about Lean Scala down here in comments and I'll try to discuss them with Martin on the podcast!

In abstract graphs, you can remove edges connecting notes via contraction. Illustrated below you see that the highlighted edge $e$ is removed in such a way that the node $y$ is removed as well. To not destroy the path from $x$ via $y$ to $z$, the formerly indirect connection becomes a direct one:

Applied to Zettelkasten
Imagine each node in the graph is a note in your Zettelkasten.
Imagine each edge in the graph is a link from one note to another. (We actually would need arrows/directed connections)
Then the operation above could be applied to e.g. export a sub-network of your notes while skipping some notes in the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I've been recently trying to get more intentional about treating Emacs Lisp like 'any other programming language' and so I have a question about package development.
 Let's say that you are developing two packages that depend on different versions of the same package. You are using Eask/Cask/Eldev/Keg/etc and so you have two projects: foo and bar that both depend on some third package baz, but one of them is 'stuck' at an earlier version. The packages are otherwise unrelated. For the argument's sake, you cannot upgrade. How do you get completion, documentation, jump to definition etc pointing at the correct version of baz? Do you clear up your load path every time you switch between the projects?
 Or to put question differently, when you develop foo.el, how do you get elisp completion and documentation relevant only to what foo.el should be able to access and not to anything defined in your configuration? Right now if I open any .el file elisp-completion-at-point will happily suggest any function or variable that I ever defined in init.el. I can of course start a new session and load only foo.el . But then I lose all my customization to get accurate completions.
 This is a pretty common scenario within the larger programming ecosystem and most languages/tools handle it without the developer ever thinking about it, but I have not seen anything on the topic in Emacs Lisp specifically. Any pointers would be appreciated.
 Edit: Some clunky wording in 3rd paragraph.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been on a journey to improve my reading and note-taking process, and I wanted to share my experience and get your thoughts.
 As a long-time note-taking enthusiast and writer, I found myself drowning in a sea of information. My Emacs was filled with org files containing highlights, bookmarks, and copied passages, yet I often struggled to recall or effectively use this information when I needed it. I realized I wasn't truly engaging with what I read.
 I stumbled upon Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten method and was intrigued. The idea of summarizing in my own words and connecting ideas across different sources resonated with me. I started experimenting with this method manually and found that I was remembering more and understanding deeper.
 My Solution
 Being an Emacs user, I thought, "Why not create a tool to streamline this process?" That's how I started working on org-zettel-ref-mode.
 Here's what it does:
  
Automatically extracts comments and summaries from the text you're reading.
 Creates an overview window for quick reference.
 Saves literature notes to custom folders.
 Enables quick commenting with a simple command.
 Allows easy navigation between notes and source material.
  
Here's what it looks like:

 I'm curious:
  
Have you ever created tools to enhance your learning process? How did it go?
 How do you manage the balance between efficient reading and deep understanding?
 Do you think automating parts of the note-taking process could be counterproductive to learning?
  
I'd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, or critiques.

 (xml-print '((ul ((class . "bg-red-400")) "Hello")) ) ;; Writes on the cursor: ;; <ul class="bg-red-400">Hello</ul> 
 The thing is, i don't want to insert/write those values, i just want to print(return as string) them. I was looking at the xml.el from the emacs source, and that thing is huge, so even if a replace all the inserts to quotes that might break something. What i did was the following function:
  (defun xml-print-string () (interactive) (let ( (dummy (generate-new-buffer "Dummy Buffer") ) (formated-xml-string "") ) (switch-to-buffer dummy) (xml-print '((ul ((class . "bg-red-400")) "Hello")) ) (setq formated-xml-string (buffer-string)) (kill-buffer dummy) formated-xml-string )) (xml-print-string) 
 Using C-X and C-E it evaluates to:
 <ul class="bg-red-400">Hello</ul> 
 It works...But i don't know if it's the best way to handle this problem. Can this function escale if i use it a lot? (As it's creating and deleting a buffer)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I was playing around a bit with SVG in emacs, and changed the way posframes look like. I also have a semi-working version of the frames being animated (sliding from the side, popping from the middle, etc.) - not shown in the screen capture (wouldn't look good in the gif).
 As you can see, I have it working with vertico (+ Marginilia, etc.), regular posframes (like the LLM summary examples), lsp-doc-ui (and eldoc-box), and for FZF.
 I am wondering if there is enough interest in packaging/cleaning up the code and releasing it as a package.
 Note: for some reason, the gif on reddit cuts off a little of the top of lsp-ui-doc, but in my emacs it works great. Had to degrade the size/quality a bit, it looks much better in real use

 I tried Treemacs but I see that it doesn't work very well with project.el. Like when I start Treemacs for the first time I get a blank sidebar. Yes, I can add a project manually to it using C-c C-p a but it is rather inconvenient to do this for every project I work with. Ideally I'd like something that automatically uses the current Git project as the project tree automatically (like how project.el detects current project from .git folders).
 Is there any package that does something like this? If not, a plain tree-format directory tree browser would also be okay for me. Let me know if you have some recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been getting more use out of Org and Agenda now that I have some nice little capture templates setup and a file that it gets stuffed into. However I've now run across something kind of weird.
 I had two meetings yesterday that I had scheduled and they did show up in the Agenda day view, however now they're showing up again today with the marker "1x". However I did not mark them as repeating. 
 So for instance I have:
 * Appointments ** NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium SCHEDULED: <2024-08-19 Mon 08:30>--<2024-08-19 Mon 13:00> ** Appt w/ Optometrist SCHEDULED: <2024-09-05 Thu 8:00>--<2024-09-05 Thu 9:00> ** 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael SCHEDULED: <2024-08-19 Tue 14:00 +7d> 
 Both the NAO and 1-on-1 meeting were yesterday. Today I'm seeing in agenda:
 Week-agenda (W34): Monday 19 August 2024 W34 notes: 8:30 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium notes: 8:30-13:00 NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium notes: 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael notes: 16:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: DONE Enroll in Benefits Tuesday 20 August 2024 notes: Sched. 1x: NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium <------ These two seem notes: Sched. 1x: 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael <------ weird 
 Why is it showing up again? As far as I can tell from the Org docs and the Agenda docs, I created the timestamp correctly. In the first instance I put in a duration (it was a long block of time) and the second does repeat, but once a week. 
 If I start to accumulate a lot of old entries this is going to get really problematic after a week or two. Any ideas on what I did wrong?
 SOLVED: Took a bit to actually get the RIGHT search engine terms because most things were just pointing back to Org Agenda docs. However the FAQ at this location (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#scheduled-vs-deadline-vs-timestamp) seems to have answered it. I just want a timestamp, not a scheduled for most things I think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to set up a system to get Emacs to profile the total time it takes to do a build. I have come up with the following:
 (global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") (lambda () (interactive) (my/refresh-all-file-buffers) (let ((project-directory (locate-dominating-file default-directory my/buildfile))) (when project-directory (with-temp-buffer (cd project-directory) (let ((elapsed (benchmark-elapse (compile (concat "python " my/buildfile))))) (read-only-mode -1) (insert (format "%.6f seconds" elapsed)) (read-only-mode 1))))))) 
 However, the "%.6f seconds" text does not appear in the buffer. Instead, I get the following message:
 Compilation finished Refreshed open files. 
 I am not sure what the issue is or if the above approach is even correct. Any help in how to get that format text to appear at the end of the buffer?
 EDIT:
 Fixed thanks to /u/arthurno1. Following is the final code, for future reference. I had to save the start time in a variable because the compile function works asynchronously.
 (defvar *last-compile-start-time*) (global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") (lambda () (interactive) (setq *last-compile-start-time* (float-time)) (my/refresh-all-file-buffers) (let ((project-directory (locate-dominating-file default-directory my/buildfile))) (when project-directory (with-temp-buffer (cd project-directory) (compile (concat "python " my/buildfile))))))) (defun my/compilation-finish-function (buffer desc) (with-current-buffer "*compilation*" (save-excursion (let ((inhibit-read-only t)) (goto-char (point-max)) (insert (format "Compilation took %f seconds" (- (float-time) *last-compile-start-time*))))))) (add-hook 'compilation-finish-functions 'my/compilation-finish-function)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[SOLVED!!... ]
 I've installed the language grammar for C++ with treesit-install-language-grammar and I can enable c++-ts-mode but syntax highlighting isn't working, only #include gets highlighted rest is all plain.
 https://preview.redd.it/eoglirodjsjd1.jpg?width=1153&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21c8be6b94e28f655e6f2f6faf08ad6be21acfc6
 I also installed treesit-auto just to be sure but it's still the same. How can I get the proper syntax highlighting?
 Edit: More details about the issue:
 My emacs version is 29.4 and tree-sitter version is 0.22.6_1*, both are installed from official voidlinux repository.*
 Following is my \Messages* buffer when I open c++ file:*
 [yas] Prepared just-in-time loading of snippets (but no snippets found). Starting Emacs daemon. Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1) signaled (treesit-query-error "Node type error at" 216 "[\"_Atomic\" \"break\" \"case\" \"const\" \"continue\" \"default\" \"do\" \"else\" \"enum\" \"extern\" \"for\" \"goto\" \"if\" \"inline\" \"register\" \"restrict\" \"return\" \"sizeof\" \"static\" \"struct\" \"switch\" \"typedef\" \"union\" \"volatile\" \"while\" \"and\" \"and_eq\" \"bitand\" \"bitor\" \"catch\" \"class\" \"co_await\" \"co_return\" \"co_yield\" \"compl\" \"concept\" \"consteval\" \"constexpr\" \"constinit\" \"decltype\" \"delete\" \"explicit\" \"final\" \"friend\" \"mutable\" \"namespace\" \"new\" \"noexcept\" \"not\" \"not_eq\" \"operator\" \"or\" \"or_eq\" \"override\" \"private\" \"protected\" \"public\" \"requires\" \"template\" \"throw\" \"try\" \"typename\" \"using\" \"virtual\" \"xor\" \"xor_eq\"] ce (auto) ce (this) ce" "Debug the query with `treesit-query-validate'") 
 After making this post I tried several different older versions of the tree-sitter-cpp language but it didn't work.
 
 Solution: I installed tree-sitter-cpp grammar version v0.21.0 after reading it in the comments and it worked. Seems I was using wrong versions so far.

 - packagename-mode,
 - Or global-packagename-mode?
 - Or packagename-global-mode? 
 I would appreciate any guidance or best practices for naming global modes in Emacs.

starts a java binary + a python program
 
sends queries to that python program via POST to localhost
 
uses the outputs of the python program to update the editor's behavior.
 
 the code relies heavily on the python program, and it's the python program that does all the heavy lifting.
 I want to make it easy for people to install and use my package. How do I install all the python dependencies and make sure they're available inside of a MELPA recipe?
 i.e. can i do something like:
 pip install numpy
 inside of my MELPA package definition? is there documentation for this? I wasn't able to find instructions for it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://i.redd.it/orel6px49mjd1.gif
 This is a "working" but still highly experimental transient for ffmpeg I've begun work on. It's currently capable of very basic conversion semantics on 1 infile and 1 outfile per interaction.
 Improvements I hope to complete:
  
Multiple infiles and outfiles per conversion; I won't consider the project complete without this
 Stream selection options on the basic conversion options
 Dedicated transient prefix for A/V filter construction and other complex directives
 Support for most of the available infile/outfile commands
  
Many of these improvements (especially the first one) require more thought than went into the prototype, so I expect progress be slow. Transients are a deep but rewarding rabbit-hole to enter. In the meantime, I don't consider the code fit for public consumption; I look forward to this changing in the future.

It doesn't need to be immediate, it's fine if it does so when called, and it should just notify me which files have been renamed, deleted, or changed names (using the ID of each referenced file).
 Is there any package that already implements this kind of functions / commands?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is an API out of my control, so I've written a few tests for it in a ZIO test suite to make sure it works as intended.
 I want to ignore these tests if the API server is down, so I've also written a ZIO effect that checks for connectivity. It was like this:
 object ApiTests extends ZIOSpecDefault { override def spec = suite("test api")( ... // tests ).whenZIO(checkConnectivity) .provideShared(ZLayer.fromZIO(ApiService.create)) private def checkConnectivity: ZIO[ApiService, Nothing, Boolean] = ... } 
 But checkConnectivity takes time to run especially if the server is down, so I want to run it only once, whereas with whenZIO on the test suite it's run once for every test in the suite. So at the moment the best I've got is this:
 import zio.test.TestAspect.beforeAll object ApiTests extends ZIOSpecDefault { override def spec = { suite("test api")( ... // tests ).whenZIO(isAlive) @@ beforeAll(checkConnectivityV2) }.provideShared(ZLayer.fromZIO(ApiService.create)) private var isAlive = true private def checkConnectivityV2: ZIO[ApiService, Nothing, Unit] = { ... // overwrites `isAlive` accordingly } } 
 I can't help but feel it's not the best practice to use a loose var here. Is there a more idiomatic way to achieve this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got into functional programming a few years back and was then introduced to category theory, specifically Bartosz's book and video series (link). I read it during my spare time for a span of around 2 years and just finished the last page. Despite having little math background other than the few math classes that are typical for a computer science major, and not being able to come up with many relevant examples, I enjoyed reading through the book and tried my best to follow along every part, except coends.
 However, I struggled with the challenges in the book. I had to look up for solutions, or just failed to understand them at all, for more than half of them. I also didn't realize until the last few chapters that I kind of got natural transformations wrong. I thought it's a morphism of F a -> G a, but really it maps any object a to a morphism F a -> G a. I noticed that my retention for the knowledge is low. In other words, I forget the details of concepts in the book pretty fast. I tried to explain to myself verbally the concepts I learned, but I can feel it's wonky sometimes.
 I'd like to ask what are the next steps for me? Should I go through a different text, maybe "Category Theory for the Working Mathematicians", or others like "Category Theory in Contexts", hoping that maybe they'll solidify and expand my learning from a different aspect? Or should I learn a few other branches of math that I'm interested, and come back to category theory and see how they relate? Or?

 I'm looking to create a custom agenda command that filters all entries associated with the categories work and business. I already have separate files named ~/org/work.org and ~/org/business.org, and from what I understand from documentation, entries in these files automatically and implicitly receive the corresponding categories.
 However, while I don't often do this, it's possible that I might explicitly set a :CATEGORY: work property somewhere else in my org files. Given this, I need a command that will capture all entries either from the ~/org/work.org and ~/org/business.org files OR with :CATEGORY: work, OR :CATEGORY: business set explicitly.
 Below I will give examples of records that I would like to filter in this way:

 I've a project that contains several subdirectories, one of which is shown as foo. The build.sc is as follows:
 import mill._, scalalib._, scalafmt._ trait MyModule extends SbtModule with ScalafmtModule { def scalaVersion = "3.4.2" def scalacOptions: T[Seq[String]] = Seq( "-encoding", "UTF-8", "-feature", "-Werror", "-explain", "-deprecation", "-unchecked", "-Wunused:all", "-rewrite", "-indent", "-source", "future", ) trait MyTestModule extends SbtTests with TestModule.ScalaTest { def scalatestVersion = "3.2.19" def scalacOptions: T[Seq[String]] = Seq("-encoding", "UTF-8") def ivyDeps = Agg( ivy"org.scalactic::scalactic:$scalatestVersion", ivy"org.scalatest::scalatest:$scalatestVersion", ) } } object foo extends MyModule { object test extends MyTestModule } 
 Questions:
  
I want to apply the scalacOptions to only the main source, not test. Currently I achieve this by overriding the scalacOptions in the MyTestModule, but it'd be nice to be able to specify the target specifically instead of declaring globally and then overriding.
 Instead of having to list each submodule foo, bar, ..., it'd be nice to be able to add them dynamically. For this project, all subdirectories that don't start with a period can be considered as a submodule.

 Then I encountered one little problem; it seems that with Emasc 29, I'm no longer able to run Emacs on MSys2 with:
 # not really working well $ emacs-29 -nw 
 whilst with v27.2, I can:
 # working okay $ /usr/bin/emacs -nw 
 The problem doesn't disappear in either the one provided by the package manager or the fresh local Emacs that I built from scratch in MSys2.
 Yes, I know that a workaround would be to use something like:
 # possible workaround with poor user experience $ winpty emacs -nw 
 This is weird though. How does the older package (v27.2) not require winpty, but does the new one (v29 above) now?

 I'm a very inexperienced programmer, and I'm planning on buying a surface pro 11. I have haskell in my upcoming classes, but I've heard people saying it's more complicated since its a windows arm based system. I've programmed a little haskell on my home pc (not ARM based) and the downloading process was fairly straightforward. So I'm wondering whether it's possible to program haskell on a new surface pro without jumping through a lot of hoops, or if it's close to the experience on a PC.

 I've two small snippets, where I'm trying to expand one snippet inside another. As the snippet that gets expanded is always the same one, and it's always expanded I've been trying to use yas-expand-snippet and yas-lookup-snippet in a transform on the field...
 My first snippet is something like,
 # key: CMakeVersion # name: CMakeVersion # type: snippet # -- ${1:Major}.${2:Minor}${3:.${4:Patch}${5:.${6:Tweak}}}$0 
 While the second snippet, that I want to expand the first into is,
 # key: cmake_minimum_required # name: cmake_minimum_required # type: snippet # -- cmake_minimum_required(VERSION ${1:Minimum$(yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet 'CMakeVersion))}${2:...${3:PolicyMax}}${4: FATAL_ERROR})$0 
 The transform seems to replace the $1 field with just a t (maybe like this?) and I'm not sure I follow why this is happening? I've tried with and without yas-triggers-in-field in the snippets and my config, but I'm unable to get it to play...
 Am I going about this the wrong way? Is there a better approach? Or can someone spot my mistake?!?
 Thanks, IGS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an enterprise CRUD appliaction, consisting of multiple services such as equipment, tasks, clients, eployees etc. They're not microservices at all, but rather modules within the mononlith Scala app.
 At first every service had its own algebra, e.g.:
  trait Employees[F[_]]: def addEmployee(person: Person): F[Unit] def vacation(employeeId: UUID): F[Unit] def findByDepartment(departmentId: UUID): F[Option[Employee]] 
 Basically a DAO. Sometimes it also does some authorization checks, but mostly its about communicating with the storage. It was cool at first:
  
Different implementations for different storage targets
 I see dependencies of every function e.g. def findEquipment[F[_]: Equipment: Employees]
 Additional type-safety - it's nice to see that a particular function works with Employees only
 Testing
  
However, after some time:
  
We've picked a single storage target
 There's no big difference in terms of dependencies with def findEquipment(equipment: Equipment[IO], employees: Employees[IO])
 Type-safety is a win in 10-20% of functions because many have 4+ algebras or even Async
 For testing I just use the same implementations with empty DB - DB is an important aspect of behavior that I need to carefully duplicate for each testing implementation
  
Tagless Final is advertised for DAO in almost every tutorial, but does it really make any sense? I switched to more concrete services and hardly going to regret. I still have TF, but for much lower-level things: Logging, Tracing, Queing etc. What is your experience? To me it looks like TF make sense in DAO only in educational materials.

I know there are a bunch of ways to install emacs on Mac. I'd like to choose something fairly simple if possible. I'd like to run stable releases rather than git dailies (mostly to avoid recompiling all packages on a daily basis). I'll be using elpaca with a pretty extensive config. 
 Thanks in advance!

 class Wrapper t where wrap :: a -> t a unwrap :: t a -> a 
 Now, of course, I could write:
 newtype Box a = Box a instance Wrapper Box where wrap = Box unwrap (Box x) = x 
 But I'm wondering if it's possible to provide a way for Wrapper to become stock-derivable so that I can write the more concise newtype Box a = Box a deriving Wrapper. 
 I've tried searching for info on this, but I've only been able to find information about, just, how to use deriving in general.

They are actually buffer-local variables, but since I spend most of my time in narrowed org buffers, I decided to hook the modification of the local variables to the narrowing and widening of the buffer. I'm sure it has a lot of room for improvement, but so far it has worked well for me.
 The function hack-local-variables-property-drawer is the one to run when an org buffer is interactively narrowed or widened. Why interactively: you don't want it to run 50 times in a row when calling org-agenda, for example. If it's not the first time it runs in a buffer, it first restores the original values of the variables it changed last time. Then it reads the new variables from the "LOCAL_VARIA…]]></summary>

 Traversing through threads on Emacs bugs, I found this chain that describes how one can avoid a crash. Namely, run
 emacs -q --xrm "emacs.synchronous: true" 
 (it has to be -q rather than -Q, as the latter ignores all X resources).
 This is fine for one-off uses of the xwidget-webkit browser, but I use Emacs in daemon mode, and
 emacs --init-directory=~/my-init-dir --daemon --xrm "emacs.synchronous: true" 
 continues to crash (I specify the init-directory as I have it in a different location, the problem arises even without it).
 Has anyone found a way around this yet? FWIW, I'm still using Emacs 29.1, will upgrade soon to 29.4.

I tried writing directly on notion but 1. the subpage system is driving me crazy (a page can be a link, or can be a whole line! and if you delete the whole line one, the page will be deleted, and sometimes you don't need whole line one; let alone the subpage being attached to parent so moving things around is another hassle) 2. It looks ugly compared to my emacs theme or website theme. 
 The pain plus the bliss of writting in org-mode made me wonder if there's a way to write in org-mode and export it to notion. I guess if I have the bulk of the doc done at some permanent form(don't need to edit much) I don't care where it is on anyway. So what I'm looking for is a solution to 1. write a lot of stuffs in org-mode(possibly from lots of files linked together with org-id or file link) 2. slide them into notion as a cluster of pages. 
 I'm currently trying notion's builtin import function https://www.notion.so/help/import-data-into-notion So far html is not working(failed with no error message), and I'm trying others, but I wonder if there's others have done this before?
 Currently my solution is to 1. write my stuff with org-mode and publish to my personal website (e.g. https://hermanhel.codeberg.page/braindump-ui/#f351ae9c-c280-4c71-9b12-1b8ba4a4200d this some doc I wrote about using huggingface) 2. make a page on notion and stick link to my website there. But this way other's cannot edit it.

I would prefer it to stay as the org-ql-view-list and open the jumped-to-buffer side-by-side to it, so I can jump to the findings one after the other and view them.
 Now, this works well by running toggle-window-dedicated after the org-ql-view-buffer is made up.
 How can I make this the preferred behavior? Would be great if there were an org-ql-view-after-show-hook I could bind it to, but there seems to be none. Is there another way to program "toggle-window-dedicated should be run every time after I called org-ql-search"?

 I ask this mainly because it seems like there is a good chunk of the Scala community that isn't satisfied with SBT, but the main hurdle to any other competition seems to be the ecosystem of plugins that would be lost, or would require separate maintenance by OSS maintainers. Given that there are now several build tools, SBT, Mill, Bleep, Scala-Cli (sorta), Bazel, Gradle, and Maven, that can be used to compile and build Scala code, maybe there is enough examples to figure out a portable standard?

 I've tried both toc-org and org-make-toc packages, which claim to support GitHub. But something must have changed. 
 Each anchor that GitHub generates for a section header is preceded by the number of that header. So instead of github.com/me/bla.org#introduction it's github.com/me/bla.org#1-introduction. Likewise for a sub-header it would be #12-nameofsubheader instead of just nameofsubheader.
 Neither TOC libraries seem to support this format, and I can't find an easy org-mode function that will give me the proper number for a given section, that can work with the TOC stuff.
 I'm wondering: * Could I be doing something weird in my org-mode file that is making GitHub add the numbers to the anchors? * If not, are there any TOC packages that will generate the proper GitHub links?

I recall having it work without the brackets and all instances of banana turning into links.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to run some code after any arbitrary elispf function finishes.
 The question may seem odd, since elisp is synchronous, but it can call async processes. For instance, it may call a compilation process. The elisp function would then continue as normal without waiting for the compilation buffer to finish.
 I know compilation mode has hooks to handle this, but I need to generalize this, not only for compilation mode.
 What is the use case? I am the author of conner. With it, you can define arbitrary commands that can be ran with arbitrary "runners", such as compilation mode, various built-in terminals, or have the command be interpreted as elisp code.
 I would like to have the option of running hooks after a command finishes, but since the runners are interchangeable, and can be defined by users, I would need a generalized way to achieve this.
 Is it possible to run the function that runs the commands in a separate process, and wait for all child processes to finish or something like that? Although that would most certainly open a separate emacs instance or something, and I would like it to run in the current one.
 Thanks.

 Hi there!
 I recently started learning Haskell to gain a better understanding of functional programming. One of the things that caught my attention was raytracing, which is both fun and interesting.
 Haskell is a truly delightful language. Every time I solve a problem or learn a new approach or concept, using monads in real-life scenarios brings me immense joy. One of the most challenging tasks at the beginning was generating random numbers. I had to do a lot of reading and learning before I could efficiently generate them. The difference between Haskell and other languages is significant, and it takes some time to get used to it.
 I would really appreciate some feedback from experienced Haskellers. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or inefficiently.
 Current result

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, inspired by the post A tutorial quantum interpreter in 150 lines of Lisp I decided to write something similar in Haskell. Is not the best implementation but for me was fun because I had the opportunity to write some Haskell after a long time. So, I decided to post the package (hqcsim) on hackage.
 The package dependencies are hmatrix and random and currently it contains a library and an executable. I plan to maintain the package and write tests.
 A difference between the implementation presented in the article and hqcsim is that in the my implementation the measurement is implicit. In the article, there is a "Measurement" operator, as seen in the syntax definition:
  program := ( instruction* ) instruction := ( GATE matrix qubit+ ) | ( MEASURE ) matrix := a complex matrix #2A( … ) qubit := a non-negative integer 
 In my implementation, there is not MEASURE instruction, that being implicit at the end of the program.

Yes, I know there is probably a "better" option, like Kotlin, but I don't want to use it. TL;DR, at the same time I want to use some of Java frameworks/libraries (including the standard one) and features (annotations, enums, good concurrency, static typing, etc...), I want some of Scala goodies, should I use Scala?
 EDIT (please read): I think i have to add some context here, because maybe some people have understood me wrong... maybe because i didn't explained properly. NO, I do not want to use bad practices from Java, and of course I will use Scala good practices, like I said, I want to use the features, frameworks/libraries and some code ideas, not the entire mindset or bad things from the language. If I wanted to use Java code entirely, I would use Java.

 I have two machines that both have access to a home network drive. On that drive, I've got a folder called Notes and that's got notes.org and a bunch of Denote files. So far so good. 
 On one machine (the laptop) I can launch Emacs and do org-agenda n and it'll pull up the day's schedule and current TODO list. On the desktop machine, if I do the same, it seems to just hang. There are no error messages, just silence. I've had to process kill Emacs a few times now to try different things.
 Any idea what org-agenda is doing that would cause it to hang?
 UPDATE: I went into .emacs.d and deleted everything pertaining to org-mode persistence, history, and things like that. That seems to have solved the issue for now. I guess between the two Emacs sessions, something got out of sync. Wish I knew what though, or how to avoid it in the future.

 The specific case is using emacs to edit ledger-cli entries, and I want to total the values in a split-transaction. Here's an example:

 calc-do-grab-rectangle: $’s not allowed in this context
 I understand I could reformat the text so the "$" won't get selected, for example adding spaces between "$" and the amount like this:
 2001-01-04 * (797) City of Austin Assets:Checking:UFCU:Bjorg -$59.62 Expenses:Util/Austin:Electric $23.29 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 4.23 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 5.48 Expenses:Util/Austin:Solid Waste $17.91 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 8.71 
 I can then make sure I select the rectangle without the "$" before using C-x * :
 It'd be nice if I can tell emacs calc to ignore "$", but I'm not that conversant with elisp. As far as I can tell, the "not allowed in this context" error is throwing an exception in calc-aent.el when it's checking something with a defvar "calc-dollar-values"? Is that something I can customize in .emacs or init.el?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! We are hosting a Haskell meetup in Vienna on the 26th of September! The location will be at TU Vienna Treitlstraße 3, Seminarraum DE0110. The room will open at 18:00.
 We plan to have 1-2 short talks starting at 19:00 (topics to be announced). Depending on interest there might also be a short Show & Tell session giving people the opportunity to show off or talk about something they work(ed) on for 5-10 Minutes each.
 There will be time to discuss the presentations with some snacks and non-alcoholic drinks being provided afterwards with an option to acquire beer for a reasonable price.
 The meetup is open ended but we might have to relocate to a nearby bar as a group if it goes very late.. There is no entrance fee or mandatory registration, but to help with planning we ask you to let us know in advance if you plan to attend here https://forms.gle/Paiw6D4QJzTKzcmM6 or per email at haskellvienna.meetup@gmail.com. 
 We especially encourage you to reach out if you would like to participate in the show&tell or to give a full talk so that we can ensure there is enough time for you to present your topic.
 We hope to welcome everyone soon, your organizers: Andreas(Andreas PK), Benny, Chris, fendor, VeryMilkyJoe, Samuel

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see that Emacs has many superfluous key bindings, especially C-f, C-b, C-p, C-n, C-a, C-e, C-d, C-v, M-v, which are for functions with already dedicated keys on the keyboard. The dedicated keys are easily accessible on my custom keyboards, so these default bindings do not benefit me at all, and they occupy convenient places for some more useful functions.
 Is there a keymap for Emacs designed to override these bindings with some functions which are useful and by default less easily accessible?
 A naive idea would be to replace the bindings with whatever I want. But that would not be optimal because that would free some slightly less convenient key combinations which could be taken by some slightly less useful functions, & c., so an optimal result would move many functions from less convenient key combinations to more convenient key combinations. So it would have generally simpler key bindings maybe very different from the default ones. That design requires some serious thought, so reinventing this would be difficult, so I would rather look if someone has already done something like that.

 It's been an issue since I started using Emacs, but it's been happening more often recently, probably because of more config?

(GHC), in an attempt to speed up compile times.
GHC is renowned for many things, but compilation speed isn’t one of them.
One specific problem exposed in issue #20264 is that in Core,
GHC’s intermediate representation, types are systematically inlined, resulting in large type trees having to be
traversed and transformed along the pipeline.
This blog post aims to explain why this is the case, in which situations it can result in slow compile times and large
memory usage, and what we can do about it.

 I found a previous message here from 5 years ago stating this was a tls 1.3 issue.
  
I don't know how to disable it and my searching hasn't found any realistic ways
 
I don't think it is smart to disable tls 1.3 as that sounds unsecure
 
 My eww settings are vanilla - nothing changed. I can get to https urls via firefox without any delay.
 Thoughts?

 To avoid getting myself into a similar situation again, I intend to release much more frequently going forward. So it is with delight, that I can report, that today I have already released version 0.4.1.
 More information can be found in the release announcement.

 So I find output of `xref` a bit unreadable, esp if a symbol is being referred in multiple files. So, I wanted to specify different color/font attributes for lines that contain name of the file where symbols are defined. 
 I noticed that - file name line although doesn't have a different face, it does have a text-property called `xref-group`. Is there a way to colorize and specify some font attributes(such as bold) based on text-property.

 lisp (equal :sublist (list-classify '() '(1 2 3))) (equal :equal (list-classify '() '())) (equal :superlist (list-classify '(1 2 3) '())) 
 The task is to implement function list-classify that checks whether 2 list are equal or unequal or superlist or sublist (of one other). 
 I'm not asking how to implement it (please don't tell me the solution). Just asking what does : represents. I don't know what it's called, (and more importantly what to search about on internet) where to read only about this part. 
 Currently I'm just lost directionless in the sea of elisp-manual. Don't even know what to search in it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I have been wanting some emacs-like mindmap app for a very long time, and all the while I'm thinking of implementing a lisp myself in a similar way. 
 It just downed on me that as complete emacs is already as a lisp machine it probably just lacks builtin API for a canvas, so I can probably fork the C part, keep only the language core and runtime(and keybinding system, I don't know where it is yet), ditch the text-editor part, add canvas support with qt or something, then build a mindmap API in elisp.
 How doable do you think this is? Will emacs source be too tangled with the text-editor part for such thing, or is there some obviously better way to build a lisp mindmap app?
 ps: for reference, the mindmap app I'm thinking about is one with emacs-like lisp runtime and keybinidng system. That along I think will be enough for most things to be built on top off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have ~/.config/emacs, with the usual init.el and early-init.el. I just learned about the no-littering package which looks great. I use elpaca for my package loader/manager. I've run through the migration process, all works OK when I do (use-package no-littering :ensure t) near the top of my init.el. But to really clean up, I want it to handle my eln cache, which I think means I need to load it in my early-init.el so I can call startup-redirect-eln-cache on it. But of course elpaca isn't set up there. If you have a similar config to mine, how do you handle this case?
 Same question for `elpa` and `elpaca`: I'd like those to go into `var/` but there's a chicken-and-egg problem. What do you do?

 Does anyone have suggestions on the best way to set these things up? If I put a TODO in a note, it would be nice to be able to see an agenda view of uncompleted notes and links to where it was generated. I've read through the Agenda section in the Org manual but I'll be honest, it was kind of long on detail and short on practicalities. I think I managed to get it work if I had a single agenda file in the ~/.emacs.d directory but what I'd like is something more comprehensive.
 I know it's sort of a personal thing how people set it up, but I'm kind of starting from scratch on this and some models would be good. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi every, I am reading the book "Thinking with types" and I get confused about implicitly universally quantified. Sorry if this question is silly because English is not my first language.
 In the book, the author says that
 broken :: (a -> b) -> a -> b broken f a = apply where apply :: b apply = f a 
  
This code fails to compile because type variables have no notion of scope. The Haskell Report provides us with no means of referencing type variables outside of the contexts in which they’re declared.
  
Question: Do type variables have no scope or they are scoped within "the contexts in which they’re declared" (type signatures if I am not mistaken).
 My understanding is that type variables in type signature are automatically universally quantified, so
 broken :: (a -> b) -> a -> b 
 is equivalent to
 broken :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b 
 forall a b. introduces a type scope. However, without the ScopedTypeVariables extension, the scope of a and b is the type signature where they are declared, but not the whole definition of broken.
 This quantification is to ensure that a and b in the type signature are consistent, that is, both occurrences of a refer to the same a, and both occurrences of b refer to the same b.
 Question: Is my understanding correct?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 I feel quite frustrated with the instability of counsel-projectile. I trigger `counsel-projectile-find-file` and it randomly opens switch-project instead. The repository looks like not maintained anymore.
 I'm looking for a package that;
  
Allows me to switch projects easily
 
find files within project
 
Switching to other buffers in project
 
Search for code within the project.
  
And I'm looking for a fast UX. Any suggestions? 
 Here's my current keybindings:
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "M-p f") 'counsel-projectile-find-file)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "M-p p") 'counsel-projectile-switch-project)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "M-p b") 'counsel-projectile-switch-to-buffer)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "M-p s") 'counsel-projectile-rg)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "M-p r") 'projectile-replace-regexp)

It seems to me that using a three- letter alphabetical code at the beginning would help organize better.
For instance LOG is Logic PHI is Philosophy.
Instead of having arbitrary numbers that have to be remembered, a three-letter code could kind of be like an airport code where it makes it really easy to remember, and of course they would be filed alphabetically and then numerically.
Why not?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago I found out about Open RSS. So far I only use it to get beautifully crafted feeds of YouTube channels and playlists with video descriptions and thumbnails. 
 I could have just used the feeds provided by YouTube instead, only if entries would have thumbnails and video descriptions.
 I could have just used an “intelligent” reader like Feedly. But I don’t like proprietary garbage with integrated AI that just ends up making my life harder. And also it’s not Emacs. 
 I could have just an alternative frontend like Invidious. But playlist feeds don’t have thumbnails and videos, entries obviously link to invidious instances and not to YouTube directly and these public instances are slow. I didn’t have the resources to selfhost my own instance and just wanted a convenient, performant solution. 
 I could have just used Elfeed in conjunction with Elfeed-tube. These packages are actually great, but I’m a Gnus user. 
 For anyone with similar opinions and experiences Open RSS might be very well worth a try. For me it hits a perfect sweet spot. It’s also privacy-friendly and is developed in a transparent fashion. Although the source code is not publicly available, at least as far as I know. But that’s understandable as they’re kept alive by their user’s donations.
 Mark, the developer of Open RSS, is quick to reply if one encounters any issues and already helped me out once.

 1) One

 3) Three
 So there cannot be any space in between because if so inserting a new element will restart the count

 Is there a way to avoid so?

I think we can do it even simpler. Relying just on Scala's implicit mechanism:
  
for components that are to be wired together, use case classes, so that Scala generates apply method to construct it
 use a helper method, which will call this apply, but fetch the arguments from the implicit context; we can call this method fromContext, more on it later
 have all the components …]]></summary>

When you first open the customize interface, one is checked by default, but the "state" widget says that the variable is edited, and the shown value isn't in effect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have dabbled with org-mode a bit in the past and then kind of stopped using it. In the meantime I switched to Colemak-DHm and an ortho split Miryoku keyboard so I feel like I will be starting from scratch again essentially.
 I am interested in using both org-roam and org-mode and I would like some guidance on how to get started. Besides the general advice, I have some specific questions.
  
Is there a recommended order in which to learn them?
 
Is org-roam just some extra commands on top of org-mode?
 
Do I need to adapt something (i.e. change location of keys) because of Colemak?
 
My use cases include notes for work and learning and I would also like to start keeping a personal diary. Shall these go to separate knowledge bases or in the same?
  
Thanks for all the answers in advance and have a nice day/night (wherever you are in the world :p)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'd like to experiment with Scala.js but I found it quite cumbersome to install a specific npm package: tonejs. My `Main.scala` file looks as follows:
 @JSExportTopLevel("Main") object Main { def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = { println("Hello, Scala.js!") val Tone = global.require("tone").asInstanceOf[js.Dynamic] val synth = Tone.Synth().toDestination() synth.triggerAttackRelease("C4", "8n") } } 
 And my build.sc:
 import mill._ import mill.api.Result import mill.scalajslib._ import mill.scalajslib.api._ import mill.scalalib._ import mill.scalalib.scalafmt.ScalafmtModule import mill.scalanativelib._ import mill.scalanativelib.api._ object tone extends ScalaJSModule { val platform = "js" def moduleKind = T { ModuleKind.ESModule } def scalaVersion = "3.3.1" def scalaJSVersion = "1.16.0" def ivyDeps = Agg( ivy"org.scala-js::scalajs-dom::2.8.0" ) def npmDeps = T{ Seq( "tone" -> "latest" ) } } 
 However, when runnin `node out/tone/fastOpt.dest/out.js`, the compiler complains with:
 export { $e_Main as Main }; ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export' 
 Am I missing any extra configuration? I kindly appreciate any suggestion.

 An Emacs modular template for early-init.el & init.el as a kick starter to a custom Vanilla Emacs configuration that is optimized for performance and sensible settings.
 Author: James Cherti
 Github: https://github.com/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.d
 This is a base starter kit for vanilla Emacs. It's really just an optimized early-init.el and an init.el that strives for fast startup times and sensible default settings. All the magic that is necessary is included. This is really nice because there's a lot of conflicting information online about the best way to optimize GC, etc. in early-init.el and this project does it for you. I've seen similar settings but I also saw some new stuff I didn't know about. 
 It is designed to keep those two files in git so you can update Minimal-Emacs. Setup additional modules for user customization in pre-early-init.el, post-early-init.el and pre/post for init.el as well. 
 It's up to the user to add to the base. If you start with this kit then proceed to watch System Crafters Emacs from Scratch series, it will get you up and running very quickly. 
 James put a lot of effort into this base starter kit and I am digging it, no cap FR as the whippersnappers are accustomed to proclaiming. ;-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been following along Real World Haskell, and getting the indentation right while following their style is infuriating.
 E.g,
 -- file: ch03/Lending.hs lend amount balance = let reserve = 100 newBalance = balance - amount in if balance < reserve then Nothing else Just newBalance 
 I find myself Pressing "tab" to overshoot the appropriate column, then hitting "backspace" in my editor to delete 4 spaces at a time (too many), then repeatedly smacking "space", overshooting again, deleting 4 spaces again, etc....
 Since the appropriate number of spaces to indent changes expression to expression, are there any editor/plugins/etc. that would allow for "contextual" tab stops, so that "tab" and "backspace" simply add and remove the right amount of spaces relevant to the expression I'm currently editing? I'm currently using vscode with haskell-language-server.
 Or would it be better to simply adopt a style that ignores this problem entirely? I.e., Google leads me to https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide
  
The indentation of a line should not depend on the length of any identifier in preceding lines.

I would love recommendations for vs codium extensions too, as I haven't programmed since college (CS) and I'm very rusty. I'm learning it strictly for fun, btw, to solve challenges, for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched to swaywm from gnome. I configured the org-download as follows
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp (use-package org-download :config (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'org-download-enable) (setq-default org-download-heading-lvl nil) (setq-default org-download-image-dir "~/ko-pa-ni/images") (setq org-download-screenshot-method "~/.scripts/sway-contrib/grimshot savecopy area") :bind (("C-c d s" . org-download-screenshot) ("C-c d y" . org-download-yank))) #+end_src 
 Whenever I use org-download-screenshot, the grimshot kicks in and I can draw a rectangle to capture the area I want on the screen, but then emacs freezes and there is no image found under the org-download-image-dir. I think it has to do with grimshot and org-download not communicating. Having no image in the directory tells me that org-download takes care of pushing the image to the configured directory but grimshot usually saves to ~/Pictures/screenshots but even there I cannot find the screenshots.

I totally understand it was probably another name for sequence notes in Zettel, my question is, if I were to do this, and how do I know if the number I give to a note is occupied? He wrote in the book that "There are no “occupied slots,” because there is no prescribed order." but if that's the case, does it mean I can have two note share the same number , say "1.1 apple is edible" and "1.1 Elephant is large mammal"? My current thought on a work around is to put that number after a UID, say yyyyMMddHHmmss and a "-" and after that begin the number sequence.
Not sure If I explain my question properly, wish you all good luck.]]></summary>

 I'm very happy to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.10 and yampa-test 0.14.10.
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa's features.
 This new release introduces a new type of integral that implements the trapezoid integration rule. Simulations executed at low sampling rates can behave in ways that violate expected physical laws (e.g., systems may gain energy over time due to inaccuracies in the calculation of positions and velocities). This new integral behaves in a more stable way in such cases. Thanks to Github users idontgetoutmuch , miguel-negrao and thalerjonatha…]]></summary>

 This seems to persist between Emacs versions, and it only happens when I open a vterm shell while using TRAMP in a remote server. If I instead open a vterm shell on my local computer first and then ssh into the remote server, it doesn't have this issue.

I have a few additional computers at home, including a web server. I don't really use org on mobile devices. I want to be able to put my org files on my own server and read them primarily from off-network.
 Currently I'm syncing my org files through OneDrive, which works for the most part. I only rarely use my personal computers for org, but would like to be able to reference them, esp. from the server for automations.
 It occurred to me that this could be done reasonably easily through WebDAV. I'm literate enough to set up the technical stuff myself, but realize I may be overlooking other options. Really, I'm less literate in Emacs/org, so I'd ask the community - is there anything wrong with using a WebDAV mount for org files? In terms of use, security, whatever. Is there some better way to share org files on my home server that can be mounted to a directory in linux?
 (for what it's worth: I cannot use a VPN at work but can use an SSH tunnel)

 /workspace/x/a/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c /workspace/x/b/another/very/long/path/.../foo_b.c /workspace/x/ya/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c ... 
 Right now I'm using my own adhoc/hackish command (plugged into capf@vertico) to complete with "foo".
 Vertico would show: (/workspace/x is the git repo's top-level)
 Open File: foo foo_a.c in a/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c at /workspace/x foo_a.c in ya/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c at /workspace/x foo_b.c in b/another/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c at /workspace/x 
 Is there any melpa/elpa/buitin package/solution that does file-name completion while ignoring the dir? especially ones that let vertico clearly show the filename sans-directory in the completion list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm using vertico and marginalia in my emacs setup. I was following System Crafters video to set up and configure org-roam. I'm not seeing tags in my results when I search for nodes. For example, I have #+filetags: project in some of my nodes. But I don't see them in the results when I run org-roam-node-find. I'm unable to filter by them.
 I'm not sure if this is related to marginalia or vertico. But here are my configs for both.
 Marginalia config
  (use-package marginalia :after vertico :custom (marginalia-annotators '(marginalia-annotators-heavy marginalia-annotators-light nil)) (marginalia-align 'right) (marginalia-align-offset -5) :init (marginalia-mode)) 
 Vertico config
  (use-package vertico :bind (:map minibuffer-local-map ("<Backspace>" . rr/minibuffer-backward-kill)) :custom (vertico-cycle t) :init (vertico-mode +1) (setq completion-styles '(flex partial-completion) completion-ignore-case t completion-category-defaults nil completion-category-overrides nil)) 
 Also, here's one of my roam nodes:
 :PROPERTIES: :ID: AFD9D19B-00AC-477C-95CE-7F02BA88D527 :END: #+title: Foo #+category: Foo #+filetags: project * Tasks * TODO Test task SCHEDULED: <2024-08-09 Fri> 
 Am I missing any config? Any help would be appreciated.
 EDIT: I had to set the following line while setting up org-roam.
 (setq org-roam-node-display-template (concat "${title:*} " (propertize "${tags:10}" 'face 'org-tag)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a Doom Emacs user. I am trying to hide the habits consistency graph from a custom agenda view.
 I tried a few variations of the following to try to only affect this custom view (works for agenda-groups):
 lisp (agenda "" ( (org-habit-graph-column 0) (+org-habit-min-width 0) (org-agenda-span 'day) (org-agenda-start-day ".") (org-super-agenda-groups nil) )) 
 Then I tried setting some variables globally hoping to suppress it:
 lisp (after! (org org-agenda) (setq! org-habit-graph-column 1 +org-habit-min-width 10 org-habit-preceding-days 1 org-habit-following-days 1 org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today t )) 
 Every time, the graph shows in agenda. When I check the variables while in the agenda view the values are not the ones I set in the config; org-habit-graph-column (which I was the most hopeful about if set below the value of +org-habit-min-width) for example is always set to 99.
 Thanks for your help.

 As  indicated in a comment, however, this approach makes it awkward to separate the DI framework from service definitions. It occurred to me it would be easier to do so with an approach modeled on ZIO's ZLayer. I've provided a POC along with a discussion in a gist:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm upgrading an app from 2.12 to 2.13 and there's a variable declaration with an arrow function that doesn't throw an error but also isn't getting called and I'm trying to understand what's wrong with it, but my googling skills are failing me. Here's is a pseudocode version of it:
  class { function("/route")(SourceParamsReads(Reads)) { println("a log here prints successfully") Params => println("no logs here or beyond print successfully") function(Params.session) { id => val source = Params.source val user = ( groupId = Params.groupId userId = Params.userId ) val future = ... future.map {...} } } 
 There's more in the ellipses but hopefully this is enough information. the Params variable has no references anywhere else in the application, just before the arrow and inside it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just discovered a "bug" (it wasn't a bug in magit, but a change in Git itself) in magit when I switched to a newer version of Git. After googling I found out that the problem has already been solved in magit over a year ago. Because I'm updating the Emacs packages once in a month, I was wondering why it is still in my local magit installation.
 The reason is that the release versions on NonGNU Elpa and Melpa Stable are still version 3.3.0, which was released on Oct 4, 2021. Does somebody know the reason why there are no new releases on those archives?
 Yes, I know I could use Melpa Unstable, but I don't want it, because I'm serving a lot of my colleagues with an Emacs configuration and I don't want to use unstable package versions.
 Yes, I know I could ask directly on GitHub, but I don't want to create an account for just one question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a small team of "algorithms engineers" who, as most of the "data science" / "ML" sector, use python. Pandas, numpy, scipy, etc.: all have been very helpful for their explorations. We have been going through an exercise of improving the quality of their code because these algorithms will be used in production systems once they are integrated into our core services: correctness and maintainability are important.
 Ideally, these codebases would be written in Haskell for those reasons (not the topic I'm here to debate), but I don't want to hamstring their ability to explore or build (we have done a lot of research to get to the point where we have things we want to get into production).
 Does anyone have professional experience doing ML / data-science / algorithms engineering in the Haskell ecosystem, and could you tell me what that experience was like? Especially wrt Haskell alternatives to pandas / numpy / various ML libraries / matplotlib.

 I am developing the major and minor modes for Gobra, a Go verifier. When annotating a go program with specification, we use //@ or // @, and Gobra parses these lines as logic instead of just comments (we also have the multiline variant but let's keep this as simple as possible).
 I have a minor mode for Go buffers to be able to interact with Gobra and I also want to add syntax highlighting for Gobra's specification language. This means I have to override the default syntactic-face-function to work differently for these special comments.
 What I have is this until now:
 ``` (defconst gobra-comment-regexp-prefixes '("// ?@" "/* ?@"))
 (defun gobra-update-nth (l n i) "Return a copy of the list L with the Nth element updated to I." (append (cl-subseq l 0 n) (list i) (nthcdr (1+ n) l)))…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a bit of a follow-up from this post. I have two related problems, I'm at my wits-end and I was hoping for some advice.
 The problem basically boils down to injecting context into an Aeson FromJSON parser. If I wish to read a file of JSON objects that refer to each other, I would like to be able to replace an identifier reference with the actual object when it is read. For example
  data Region = Region { regionID :: Text , regionName :: Text , regionType :: RegionType , regionParent :: Maybe Region , regionLocale :: Maybe Locale } 
 with data like
  [ { "id": "ES", "name": "Spain", "type": "Country", "locale": "es" }, { "id": "ES-CL", "name": "Castille and León", "type": "Subnational", "parent": "ES" } { "id": "ES-GA", "name": "Galicia", "type": "Subnational", "parent": "ES", "locale": "ga" } ] 
 I have an elaborate system of placeholders and normalisation at the moment to sort out the parent references to "ES" and I was wondering if there was something, a la Jackson, that would handle references naturally.
 I have lots and lots of other examples of this sort of need to reference other items.
 The other aspect of this in injecting this information, hopefully using the ReaderT pattern, into another parser that will use this data. As an example,
  data Location = Location { locationID :: Text , locationName :: Text, , locationRegion :: Region } 
 and 
  [ { "id": "S", "name": "Santiago de Compostella", "region": "ES-GA" } ] 
 where the Galicia data, with all its useful information such as locales and holidays, replaces the "ES-GA" reference.
 I have wasted waaay to much time trying to figure out how to achive this and would appreciate any useful* advice.
 * With the caveat that I do not regard "embed it into code" as "useful". The idea that I can't give users control over their configuration makes my skin crawl.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems like every time I read an article it links out to 3 more articles that I also want to read but don't have time for that day.
I created a document in Obsidian called "to read" where I store them with title, URL and a copy/pasted bit of text to jog my memory of its contents — but it's getting a bit unwieldy and I wonder if there's some better system.
I also keep a separate "recreational reading" list in NotePlan. How do you manage your list(s)?]]></summary>

Abusing Haskell: Executable Blog Posts by Sinan
I post my notes on my blog, Hashnode and dev.to, which require slightly different markdown formats. I have been doing the sane thing to fix formats so far. But it is a rainy Sunday and I am bored, so I decided to make this blog post an executable Haskell program to do the same.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a program where I have different kinds of events which share the same behavior and I'd like to store them together in a section with some other information . Is this possible to do in haskell or is there a better more idiomatic way to go about this? Here's some pseudo code:
 data eventT1 … data eventT2 … class someClass where … instance someClass eventT1 where … instance someClass eventT2 where … data someData = someData { foo :: int , bar :: [someClass] } main = do let test = someData { foo = 1 , bar = [eventT1, eventT2] } 
 The compiler complains the bar :: [someClass] part in the declaration of someData.

I've been using The Archive as my primary note-taking and knowledge-management tool for the last four years. It + the Zettelkasten method have been genuinely life-changing for me.
I wrote an essay on some of the specific reasons I love using The Archive so much. I've also shared some of the custom Alfred workflows and keyboard shortcuts I use to support The Archive, along with detailed examples.
I thought you all might enjoy the read!

However, I want to ask about how do emacs users deal with this ?! I would have preferred that org agenda open these buffers silently and only show me the buffer that contains the todo I have selected. Is there a way to enable such a behavior ? Thank you in advance.

 homodoro is what I came up with, a quite simple TUI program with some timers and an extremely simple task manager, I feel like I probably didn't learn much about Haskell/FP in general while developing this but it was the most joy I ever felt while programming something and I'm quite happy with the result.
 All feedback is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have had an init file which I have been using for a few years now. Most of my custom configs are in an org file which is then tangled using org-babel. Up until today I though what happend was :
  
I start emacs, the init file runs 
 it gets to org-babel-load file (code below)
 init.el is generated from org
 init file gets evaluated
  
However, when I was installing on a new machine today, I noticed than not all of the lisp code from the org file was in the generated init.el. Did something change in the newer versions of emacs? (newest machine is 29.4)
 Or have I just been misunderstanding how it worked all this time?
 (org-babel-load-file
 (expand-file-name "init.org"
 "~/.emacs.d/org")) 
 To resolve the issue I deleted the init.el file and restarted emacs, this time it generated and executed everything. Restarting alone made no difference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have read a few threads about this warning, but no detailled answer about how to deal with it.
 Please, correct me if I am wrong, but I understand it is a change in `org-mode` version 9.7 which throws a warning when the function is used in a non Org buffer. So, chances are that when the warning pops up, it is from an external package that has not conformed yet to that new rule/convention.
 Anyway, I get this warning every time I open the agenda time-grid, tall other built-in or custom views are working fine. This is not a terrible thing, but warnings are designed to be annoying, so I would like to get rid of it.
 Is pinning `org-mode` to a previous version the best way to go ? Any recommendation as to which version I should downgrade to ?
 I am a Doom Emacs user if it is relevant. Thanks in advance for your help.

If you disagree, what does the English word 'register' mean to you, and in a zettelkasten context, how does it differ from an index?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs makes use of a number of Linux-based command-line utilites, such as ls, grep, diff, and so on. However, recently I've started working for a company who has allowed me to have Emacs on my system, and have installed Ubuntu for Windows Subsystem for Linux on their Windows 10 systems.
 Unfortunately, sudo is not an option for my WSL instance, so there's no way to add any components (including Emacs or any GUI functionality) to my WSL instance, so I can only download the native Windows portable version of Emacs.
 I know that you can use the WSL commands by prefacing them with bash -s, such as bash -s find -name filename.ext. However, I'm not sure where I can specify this to Emacs without going through the source to find all the variables containing the commands I need.
 To make this more complicated, I also make use of Vertico and consult (among the other components).
 Is there a single location where I can notify Emacs to add bash -s to the start of shell commands, or perhaps a list of variables that I can add to my .emacs.d tree?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been researching how to use optimal evaluation to optimize Discrete Program Search and, eventually, I arrived at a simple algorithm that seems to be really effective. Based on the following tests:
 f 1001101110 = 1010100110 f 0100010100 = 1001101001 
 Solving for 'f' (by search), we find:
 xor_xnor (0:0:xs) = 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (0:1:xs) = 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:0:xs) = 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:1:xs) = 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs 
 My best Haskell searcher, using the Omega Monad, takes 47m guesses, or about 2.8s. Meanwhile, the HVM searcher, using SUP Nodes, takes just 1.7m interactions, or about 0.0085s. More interestingly, it takes just 0.03 interactions per guess. This sounds like a huge speedup, so, it is very likely I'm doing something dumb. As such, I'd like to ask for validation.
 I've published the Haskell code (and the full story, for these interested) below. My question is: Am I missing something? Is there some obvious way to optimize this Haskell search without changing the algorithm? Of course, the algorithm is still exponential and not necessarily useful, but I'm specifically interested in determining whether the HVM version is actually faster than what can be done in Haskell.

 I put it between @@html:...@@ and worked great with the link description, but didn't work at all with the link URL. What else can I try?
 I think this is mainly an issue with Hugo, but I don't know if there's another way in org to set a string as literal.

I am already pretty used to the key bindings and really like using emacs, however, I haven't quite nailed down how to get a good linter and customize emacs for that purpose. Looking to see if anyone out there has a good setup and could give me some tips on where to start. I am mainly going to be running my scripts through a server so using the terminal version of emacs is where I have been spending most of my time. Any help would be appreciated !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using emacs ver 29.4, org version 9.7.8.
 I am trying to export the matplotlib graphic to the same directory that the org files lives in:
 #+begin_src python :results graphics file output :file temp_plot_2.png import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) y = np.sin(x) fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.plot(x, y) #+end_src 
 The file is generated as expected, but ends up in the ~ directory.
 I checked the default-directory variable, and it is correctly set to the ~/images directory, where the org file lives, and where I want the graph (image) to go.
 When I use absolute paths in the :file argument (e.g., :file /home/<username>/images/temp_plot_2.png), it works as expected, but I don't want to need to provide the absolute path every time.
 Anyone have any idea what's going on, and why relative paths seem to not be working as expected?
 From the org manual, which seems to be in conflict with what I actually observe, since the directory associated with the current buffer is /home/<username>/images according to the local default-buffer variable, but file output is actually /home/<username>:
  
The ‘dir’ header argument specifies the default directory during code block execution. If it is absent, then the directory associated with the current buffer is used.
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Environment-of-a-Code-Block.html
  
I tried specifying the dir header; didn't work. I tried using M-x cd and navigating manually to the /home/<username>/images directory; didn't work.
 Thanks

The distinction I was trying to make was between direct and indirect claims.
I'm currently working on taking more effective notes using the Zettelkasten method and have encountered a challenge when dealing with claims attributed to secondary sources.
For example, academic articles typically contain numerous references to outside sources. Many of the claims discussed are not original but rather derived from these secondary sources.
My struggle is with how to properly document these secondary claims in my notes when I'm unfamiliar with the sources being referenced. I feel uncomfortable directly citing them. However, these claims are often relevant and interesting, and I want to include them in my Zettelkasten for future reference.
Here are some questions I have:
How do you approach taking notes on claims that are attributed to secondary sources when using the Zettelkasten method?
Do you cite the original source, the secondary source, or both in your notes?
How do you ensure accuracy and avoid misinterpretation when you're not directly familiar with the primary source?
Any strategies for efficiently exploring the primary sources when they seem particularly crucial to your understanding of the topic?
I’d appreciate any advice or strategies that have worked for you when navigating this aspect of academic note-taking. Thanks in advance!]]></summary>

After a bit of trying out different configs I got it working with the OAuth 2.0 setup of my employer. 
 Now I'm trying to actually use it, but I find it somewhat unexpected; perhaps that's because I have used org-gcal for a while and was expecting something similar, i.e. synchronizing of the calendar entries into an org file which can be linked to my org-agenda (and calfw).
 For example, a very frequent occurrence is to schedule meetings with other people (in person). This generally works by everybody looking at their calendar to find a spot in e.g. the next week where all of us are available. Is this possible with Excorporate? To me it seems it's only possible to check the calendar entries for a given day (via M-x calendar, moving to the date, pressing d or e), but not get a list of all the events, or all the events in a week/month. 
 Furthermore, creating events seems to be possible via the API (https://github.com/emacsmirror/excorporate/blob/master/excorporate.info, chapter 6 API Usage), but this functionality is not exposed as an interactive function. Does that mean I have to write my own helper functions here? Has anybody done so already?
 Does anybody have experiences with excorporate for these use cases?

I like this workflow but, since I'm a subpar programmer, I often end up with giant and disorganized scripts which are difficult to navigate. I eventually delete the cruft and refactor but I still end up spending a lot of time in this disorganized state. To improve navigation through the spaghetti, I thought maybe a table of contents could be made from the code-cell headers (i.e. "# %% Imports"). Does something like this already exist? Is there some other quick solution involving, e.g., code folding, bookmarks, imenu, etc.? 
 If there's no easy solution I thought this might be a good excuse to start playing with elisp and try implementing it myself. Any suggestions with respect to how to begin would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm reading <Get Programming with Haskell> book on Manning MEAP website and have difficulties in understanding its chapter 21, titled "Hello World! - introducing IO types". In my opinion, it seems to give wrong information. Below is an example:
 "If main isn't a function, it should follow that neither is putStrLn. ... As you can see, the return type of putStrLn is IO(). Like main, putStrLn is an IO action because it violates our rule that function must return values."
 The author seemed to think "IO ()" isn't a value, which I don't agree with. So I googled and found the following on Haskell wiki https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_Haskell_IO/Actions:
 "PutStrLn takes an argument, but it is not an action. It is a function that takes one argument (a string) and returns an action of type IO (). So putStrLn is not an action, but putStrLn "hello" is."
 So I think the author is completely wrong on that, isn't it? On the other hand, however, I read lots of good reviews on the book on Amazon website. Am I misunderstanding something? Thanks for any confirmation or explanation.

 I'm trying to write a util function to clean up org-agenda items. Specifically, if an agenda item has a SCHEDULED and DEADLINE with matching date+time I would like to remove the SCHEDULED property. Here's what I've come up with but though the messages indicate my logic is fine the changes are not being reflected in org-agenda view nor in the file where an item lives. Perhaps there's some save function I'm not calling to persist the changes?
 (defun local/org-remove-schedule-if-deadline-matches () "Remove SCHEDULED from agenda item if DEADLINE exists and matches." (interactive) (org-map-entries (lambda () (let ((scheduled (org-entry-get nil "SCHEDULED")) (deadline (org-entry-get nil "DEADLINE"))) (when (and deadline scheduled) (let ((scheduled-day (org-time-string-to-absolute scheduled)) (deadline-day (org-time-string-to-absolute deadline))) (when (= scheduled-day deadline-day) (message "removing SCHEDULED from task: \"%s\" in file %s" (org-get-heading t t t t) buffer-file-name) (org-entry-delete nil "SCHEDULED") (save-buffer)))))) nil 'agenda))

 https://gitlab.com/perikov/scala-bundles
 I tried this before ( https://github.com/p-pavel/osgi-scala ) wrapping every jar into a bundle, but I finally gave up.
 Everything is badly broken (split packages is the main problem).
 So I just taken a route on bundling releases ("everything related to org.typelevel/cats/n").
 I also have Karaf features with dependencies. 
 For it lets me to just type `feature:install myApp` and have relevant libraries from cats ecosystem (and also elastic4s and others) just install transparently from maven. 
 and `feature:uninstall` just unloads everything.
 I'm not sure if I have to put all this on maven (maven central requires packaging sources with jars, and my jars are just bundles containing relevant libs).
 Is there any interest on this topic?

 My question is what "flavor" of emacs should i use that best fits my needs?
 All i ask is rich text, image viewing support, linking to other notes/files, hierarchical notes and optionally a GUI.
 I don't mind steep learning curves nor the specific type of rich text.

        <updated>2024-08-05T13:25:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Scala 2.13, and play-json, I used the following pattern to serialize/de-serialize between case classes and Json:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} object WelcomeResult { implicit val format = Json.format[WelcomeResult] } case class WelcomeResult(service: String) 
 defining implicit formatin the companion object of the case class, made it easily visible from outside, so the following code worked without even requiring an extra import:
 val welcome = WelcomeResult("test") val json = Json.toJson(welcome) 
 In Scala 3 I saw the type class derivation feature and though I could take advantage of it by a. making the code more compact. b. defining such a default formatting only once in a generic way in the type class.
 This is the implementation I have in mind:
 case class WelcomeResult(service: String) derives JsonFormat
 And then something like this in JsonFormat:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} trait JsonFormat[T] { val format: Format[T] } object JsonFormat { def derived[T](using scala.deriving.Mirror.Of[T]): JsonFormat[T] = { new JsonFormat[T]: override val format: Format[T] = Json.format[T] } } 
 But Json.format[T] fails with some "Instance not found: 'Conversion[T, _ <: Product]'" error. I guess, from other examples that I need a macro to implement the desired behavior, but not sure how.
 Any help appreciated.

So direct-style effects and monad effects can be seen as just two different syntaxes for writing the same thing.
