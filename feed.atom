        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tend to program with Rust/Ocaml/Python/PHP etc. But I just love the Haskell Language.
 The only thing that has been a deal killer for me so far has been laziness.
 Reading https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-05-12-strict-vs-lazy/ further convinced me that laziness just causes too much grief.
 I am eager to write strict Haskell. I understand the the -XStrict and Unlifted datatypes help with this. Actually it is interesting that -XStrict does not really cut it, we need unlifted datatypes..
 However, I want to be able to use libraries and preludes that assume everything is strict and/or unlifted.
 Is it possible in 2022 to write Haskell as it if it was a strict language like, say, OCaml? However, where are the strict monad transformer libraries, strict by default preludes etc. Every notable library seems to be lazy...
 I like Purescript -- a dialect of Haskell that is pure and strict. However, Purescript does not have such a lively ecosystem, mature tooling etc. like Haskell.
 I would love to be writing Haskell with Purescript like semantics. Any suggestions?

 I seem to recall coming across a package that put coordinates into a property value and then could display the headings in a corkboard or desktop type view.
 It may have been a brainstorming package, or maybe a plotting package, but I can’t seem to find it, does anyone know of a package with a feature like this?

 For a common use case of multiple threads incrementing a counter it works surprisingly faster that TVar, MVar or ever plain IORef. Even more surprisingly, this counter is a faster single-threaded mutable integer cell than IORef. If you're curious, benchmarks are on github.

 I have created my own config from scratch after having used Doom briefly and Prelude extensively. This is working far better, and it's teaching me a lot.
 On a side note, I would really appreciate feedback into how this config can be improved, best practices, better choices, etc.
 See my config here: https://github.com/averageflow/dotfiles/tree/master/joeTumbleweedIKEADell/emacs
 I use a variety of packages, including consult, marginalia, vertico, corfu and orderless, use-package with straight.
 I love orderless, and when I manually enable it, works wonderful, but for some reason, it doesn't get properly activated in my setup (init.el) when following the documentation:
 (use-package orderless :custom (setq completion-styles '(orderless basic) completion-category-overrides '((file (styles basic partial-completion)))) ) 
 When I do (print completion-styles) it gives me just (basic). Somehow it gets overriden I think ?
 I've also tried to change that :custom by :config and to use the setq outside the use-package block, to no avail.
 So I have had to resort to
 (custom-set-variables '(completion-styles '(orderless basic)) ) 
 And this seems to work. But how can I / should I get rid of it this way? 
 Why doesn't it work in the use-package declaration? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/scala, I would like to ask if any of you have encountered this problem before
 While programming in Scala, whenever I encounter certain types of situations that would have thrown an exception while programming in Java don't seem to be throwing any exceptions in Scala.
 A very simple example that doesn't throw an exception for me is:
 val list = (0 to 5).toList println(list(10)) 
 Surely this should generate an IndexOutOfBoundsException?
 Another example:
 val mappy = Map("a" -> 5) println(mappy("b")) 
 This also does not throw any exceptions.
 My Scala version is 3.2.1, and my intellij version is IntelliJ IDEA Edu 2022.2.2 using the Scala plugin, and my project type is an SBT project generated by intellij, incase any of that is relevant.
 I have also tried messing with the intellij settings, turning on stuff like "prohibited exception thrown" since I saw online that something like that might help, but I haven't seen any changes yet. I'm thinking about trying to throw out my entire scala plugin & installs and try again from scratch, but I figured I'd ask here first.

 Thank you very much

 Recently I posted how could I figure out the face variable for LSP breadcrumbs. I solved it.
 I hope the following is helpful.
 TL;DR
  
Even non-elisp hackers can understand elisp. Don't be intimidated.
 Thank you /u/CorysInTheHouse69 for the nudge.

 /u/CorysInTheHouse69, politely, repeatedly mentioned I should consult the underlying code. They were right, that's the right approach. Even for a non-elisp hacker, one can see patterns!
 I found the pattern in the doom theme (doom-themes-base.el) base code and saw the line (header-line :inherit 'mode-line) That is, the header line is matching my mode line. That's not what I wanted! Boom!
 Walking up the code, I see the following comment:
 ;;; Code: ;; These are used as a basis for every Doom theme defined with `def-doom-theme', ;; as a set of reasonble defaults. They are intended to be overidden where it ;; makes sense to. 
 operative word overridden!
 In my init.el I override (header-line and now, I have what I want. \o/
 Here's an example of my unit test:
 (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. ... '(header-line ((t (:background "blue" :foreground "black")))) ...) 
 Go forth and hack!

How do you take manual bib notes when reading from an ebook, that doesn't have page numbers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://github.com/anticomputer/age.el
 Since I'm starting to purge gpg out of my life, but do depend on it heavily for keeping my org notes and authinfo encrypted, I needed an epa/epg-style transparent encryption support for age (https://github.com/FiloSottile/age). As such I ported the relevant epa/epg code and reworked it to work with age. 
 age.el provides transparent encryption and decryption support for .age files in Emacs, much like epa/epg support .gpg files. That means you can do all the things with .age files you're used to doing with .gpg files in Emacs now.
 Like most of my packages, this is mostly written to support my personal use cases, but I've seen some other folks mention that they wanted to start using age over gpg, so have a look if this seems useful to you.

 The project builds correctly when I have 8.10.7 set as default with ghcup as well as when I swap back to it after trying to get 9.2.5 to work. When I set the default to 9.2.5 and start VSCode with the project folder, hls errors and says that it can't determine what compiler version should be used, which is fair I guess, but again I have no idea what I need to change because there isn't any information in the .cabal file about what compiler version to use.
 When I try to build the project, I get this error
 cabal-3.6.2.0.exe: ghc-pkg dump failed: dieVerbatim: user error (cabal-3.6.2.0.exe: 'C:\ghcup\bin\ghc-pkg.exe' exited with an error: ghc-pkg-9.2.5.exe: C:\\cabal\\store\\ghc-9.2.5\\package.db\package.cache: withBinaryFile: inappropriate type (not enough bytes) 
 and almost all of the solutions/advice I've been able to find online for dealing with that have to do with stack which I'm not using. The one that wasn't about stack said to delete the project folder and clone it again from github but doing that didn't work.
 Any help would be deeply appreciated. If the solution is to just uninstall everything including ghcup and reinstall with only 9.2.5, is there something I should change about the .cabal file in the project before I do that to make sure it works correctly after reinstalling?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that the *> operator is pronounced as "then". For example, Just 10 *> Just 20 would be read as "just 10 then just 20". However, I couldn't find a definitive source on how to pronounce the <* operator. Personally, I've been pronouncing it as "after". For example, Just 10 <* Just 20 would be read as "just 10 after just 20". But, I'm not satisfied with the semantics of this pronunciation. It doesn't match the meaning of the <* operator. How do you pronounce the <* operator?
 Edit: The reason I want to know this is because I want to implement these operators in an object-oriented language. So, Just 10 *> Just 20 would become Just(10).then(Just(20)). Similarly, I want a name for Just 10 <* Just 20. Hence, not pronouncing them or using the same name to pronounce them is not an option.

 I have a long persisting issue I'd rather get rid of if anyone can point me in the right direction. When I first start Emacs (whether directly or as a client) my screen is extremely compressed (screenshot below). If I reload configuration it displays normally.
 I am currently on 28.2 but this has persisted from 27.x. You can probably just make out in the screenshot that this is Doom emacs just in case that has any relevance.
 Here is the screenshot:

 Searches do not yield any help that I've found and I'm honestly not sure where to look.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 Is there an emacs distribution, which upon startup would present itself as a full-featured organizer?
 What I'm looking for is something opinionated, not necessarily easily configurable even, but something that works and does the job¹ out of the box.
 ¹ the job I define as something done by conventional organizers (todoist, ticktick), namely:
 - manage todo tasks
 - attach text notes to tasks
 - set date on tasks
 - set tags on tasks
 - agenda view
 - calendar view
 - maybe something like org-gcal?
 - preferably evil mode
 I'm willing to invest only minimal effort into learning this opinionated way of using org-mode. I'm not interested in the endless feature-set emacs can offer. I may decide to tinker with the setup later. But I don't want to do all the learning upfront.
 Does a distribution like this exist?

It's unclear to me how to productively capture this framework & begin developing out within my Zettelkasten.  I've kept my ZK for ~6 months now, so I'm familiar with the framework (both from notes workflow & ideas workflow perspectives).
Currently, I'm considering this method:
Create a note that contains the flowchart itself.
Branch off of this note by creating a new note for each Phase & each document.
Dive into the methodologies & techniques required at each Phase from there.
Am I on the right track?  Is there anything obvious that I'm missing here?]]></summary>

My current problem mostly is I’d really love to use Org Mode for my Math Notes but I don’t know how to insert symbols or structure things like larger division statements, or anything with how to insert functions.
 I’ve heard things about LaTeX being the optimal way to get this done; seemingly Emacs should have some integration with this but I don’t entirely know where to start with that and I don’t actually know a thing about LaTeX so I was wondering if anyone could offer me guidance on how to achieve the optimal note-taking Emacs setup, and just how you lovely lads would go about this?

 How would I proceed if I want to keep type informations on my compiled module ? Is there a way to generate d.ts for each module when building with spago ? Any advice about that ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a little puzzle for the Haskell community.
 Lately I've been experimenting with tagless final encodings (or object algebras in other languages) to build ASTs where previously I would have used a recursive ADT.
 This works great if you have a simple untyped AST. New terms can be added to the AST by adding a new typeclass that extends the base one. 
 However, what you have an AST presented with a GADT, with the types of your language encoded as a data-kinded parameter? You can still encode your AST in a tagless final way by using a higher-kinded type as the carrier, and this (as before) let's us extend the terms of the language, but what if we want to extend the types?
 For instance, if we have a base AST for a simply typed lambda calculus, and we want to add products, we need both a new type constructor, and some new terms of our AST itself.
 Yet (as far as I know), it's not possible to use something like a tagless final encoding at the type level.
 Has anyone thought about solving this kind of problem? My only thought was that this might be easier to do in something like Agda or Idris, but I'm curious what a solution to this in Haskell might look like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to write a function that calculate log safely (exercise in Haskell Wikibook). Here's what I came up with:
 safeLog :: (Floating a, Ord a) => a -> Maybe a safeLog x = log x <$ guard (x > 0) 
 Then I tried to rewrite it in point-free style. After some tinkering, I came up with this version:
 safeLog :: (Floating a, Ord a) => a -> Maybe a safeLog = ap ((<$) . log) (guard . (> 0)) 
 The function works correctly; however, I don't understand how it works (specifically the concrete type of ap). Haskell language server showed that the concrete type of ap is:
 _ :: (a -> Maybe () -> Maybe a) -> (a -> Maybe ()) -> a -> Maybe a 
 The generalized type of ap is:
 forall (m :: * -> *) a b. Monad m => m (a -> b) -> m a -> m b 
 As I understand it, ap requires a function, a type a and b all wrapped in Monad m. For example, if I have this function:
 foo = ap (Just (+ 1)) (Just 2) 
 I understand that the concrete type of Monad m here is Maybe, and the concrete type of a and b is Integer. i.e.:
 _ :: Maybe (Integer -> Integer) -> Maybe Integer -> Maybe Integer 
 But in the case of ap inside safeLog:
 _ :: (a -> Maybe () -> Maybe a) -> (a -> Maybe ()) -> a -> Maybe a 
 I cannot figure out what is the concrete type of Monad m, a and b.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reading about arrays (Data.Array). 1D array construction is easy.  a = listArray (4, 8) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  creates an array with minimum index 4, maximum index 8, a ! 4 = 2, and so on.
 But I came across the following code for constructing a 2D array, and having a hard time understanding it.  xss = [ [9, 8, 7] , [5, 3, 2] , [6, 6, 7] ] matrix = listArray ((1, 1), (3, 3)) (concat xss) 
 What is the (1, 1) for? I can see how nine integers can be split into 3 rows and 3 columns without needing the (1, 1).
 The only material even discussing 2D array type is this, and sadly it doesn't answer my question.

 I have a use case where I'd like to link an image inside an org document for viewing inline, but would also like it to be suppressed upon export to PDF. 
 I'm aware of two solutions that are unsatisfactory: linking the image in a #+begin_comment #+end_comment block, or adding the image under a subheading with the :noexport: tag.
 The first is not enough since placing an image link inside a comment block prevents org recognizing it to be viewed inline, while the second is unsatisfactory because it would mess with the formatting of the document. I.e. I would have to escape the noexport subheading for every image (I confess I don't know how to do this if there is a method). Is there any way to get the desired behavior?

 This is my MWE:
 #+title: Testing org-cite \LaTeX export #+latex_header: \usepackage{natbib} #+bibliography: r4h2o.bib #+options: toc:nil #+cite_export: natbib Hello World! This is a citation: [cite:@alghamdi_2022_clas] #+print_bibliography: +end_export 
 I get an error message: "Unknown processor natbib"
 Exporting with the basic exporter works fine. CSL is also problematic.
 The Org Mode manual is a bit cryptic on this functionality.
 Anyone can help fixing this issue?
 P.S: I used a clean Emacs instance (emacs -q), no config.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: Apologies for posting in this sub, as it is only partly Haskell-related. I'm not sure where else to discuss such things.
 One of my interests in programming is the analysis of techniques used to employ better coding practices. For example, in OOP you have design patterns that adhere to design principles such as SOLID. To further the example, you can design a factory with SOLID practices considered to create code that is "clean", allowing for code reusability, and flexibility. In short, with minimal code smell.
 I am currently reading Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler to get a better understanding of things I've come to learn from practice and experience in a more well-presented context.
 I am wondering if some similar texts or resources focus on the functional style of code refactoring and reusability. I understand that many topics and techniques are simple enough to work in all contexts, but I also know that FP languages have their smells and without getting various kinds of experience (which may be difficult to do), I was hoping that I can learn of such topics.
 FP is naturally an abstract paradigm, going miles more than most OOP languages, and I want to be able to strongly analyse such topics in depth. I have moderate experience with Haskell, but due to university studies and life, I don't have the opportunity to focus more effort than I do, learning the various libraries and tools available to build a repertoire of skills from applied experience.
 Thank you very much

Configured direnv and my .bashrc as normal.
 Configured nix-direnv on NixOS by modifying configuration.nix as normal.
 Configured emacs' configuration for emacs-direnv as normal.
  
Now consider I have:
  
Make some directory /tmp/xyz, made a shell.nix or flake.nix file, and done either echo "use nix" >> .envrc && direnv allow or echo "use flake" >> .envrc && direnv allow as appropriate.
  
Then, every time I open a file, emacs-direnv direnvs in its direnv way, successfully, much to my happiness. I vterm and cd to my file and direnv also direnvs successfully.
 Let us now say I do M-x cd /tmp/xyz, wherein I have stored some .envrc and shell.nix (or flake.nix or whatever) files. Opening a file direnvs successfully. However, opening a vterm sometimes does nothing, whereupon I must first cd out of my directory and cd back into my directory.
 For some reason this happens inconsistently. Does anyone else have this problem? It seems only to occur with flake.nix files and not shell.nix files.

 My current setup is Linux + neovim (using the built in LSP) + GHC 9.2.5 + cabal 3.6.2.0 + HLS 1.9.0.0 + stack 2.7.3.
 The issue that I'm having is that while I'm in my editor, HLS will not show me compiler warnings. Other than that HLS pretty works entirely fine, I'm getting hlint hints, I can rename variables, jump to definitions, and I get code completions etc. Just no compiler warnings.
 I have verified that the server is running, and that my editor is connecting properly. I have an explicit hie.yaml. I am having this issue on all of the Haskell code I open. I have used GHCup to reinstall and build HLS from source. At this point I am at a dead end, so any leads would be greatly appreciated.

 Is there a way to make certain abbreviations straightforward, without the use of extra keys? Here's an approximation: ``` (defun abbrev-or-insert () (interactive) (self-insert-command 1) (expand-abbrev))
 (define-abbrev-table 'global-abbrev-table '( ("HH" "---~" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ("LL" "\ldots{}" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ("ДД" "\ldots{}" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ))
 (global-set-key (kbd "Д") 'abbrev-or-insert) (global-set-key (kbd "H") 'abbrev-or-insert) (global-set-key (kbd "L") 'abbrev-or-insert)  It works as desired; well, almost:  \ldots{}\ldots{}арпДД \ldots{}\ldots{} \ldots{}abaLL \ldots{}\ldots{}booLL ``` Somehow, any input after the expansion of the abbreviation is disruptive. It takes a space to make it work again. Is there a way to get rid of that space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I know there is no way to implement a mutual (or "duplicate") constructor for two different data types in Haskell.
 For example, this hypothetical code will not work:
 ```haskell data family Prim data family (a ~~> b)
 data instance Prim where Lit :: Int -> Prim
 data instance a ~~> b where Plus :: Prim ~~> Prim ~~> Prim
 -- A hypothetical data instance where either t is Prim, OR, t is (a > b) data instance (t ~ Prim | t ~ (a ~~> b)) => t where -- Apply is a mutual constructor for both Prim and (>), -- The result type depends on the type of the first constructor argument Apply :: (x ~~> t) -> x -> t ```
 The best alternative I can come up with is 
 ```haskell data Prim where Lit :: Int -> Prim CastToPrim :: Apply Prim -> Prim -- "UnApply" the type constructor, so to speak
 data a ~~> b where Plus :: Prim ~~> Prim ~~> Prim CastToArrow :: Apply (a ~~> b) -> (a ~~> b)
 data Apply t where Apply :: (x ~~> t) -> x -> Apply t ```
 Possibly with some pattern synonyms for convenience... (but this doesn't help much) 
 ```haskell pattern ApplyPartial f x = CastToArrow (Apply f x) pattern ApplyFinal f x = CastToPrim (Apply f x)
 two :: Prim two = ApplyFinal (ApplyPartial Plus (Lit 1)) (Lit 2) ```
 I was wondering if anyone has alternative ideas for this sort of thing (or knows of examples in other languages).

In the context of a Zettelkasten system, empirical process control could be used to continually evaluate and refine the organization and use of the system in order to maximize its effectiveness and efficiency.
Some potential benefits of using empirical process control for a Zettelkasten system include:
Improved organization: By continuously collecting and analyzing data on how the Zettelkasten system is being used, it may be possible to identify patterns and trends that can be used to improve the organization of the system.

 Most major modes seem to have their own version of that variable however, which means that you would need to add the variable to each major mode you want to use the capf for. Ok, but not really ideal. 
 There's another thing at play here; out of the box, the value of completion-at-point-functions in emacs-lisp-mode is (elisp-completion-at-point t); the t here apparently indicates that if elisp-completion-at-point fails, it should fall back to the next function in the global completion-at-point-functions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this post is for a very geographically specific subset of this subreddit, but I don't know a better place to ask.
 Let me say up front: I do not have a job to offer, and am not even in a position to do so. But I would like to gauge potential interest in working professionally with Haskell in the company where I am employed. They currently develop mainly in .Net, C#, but a couple of years ago I was allowed to build a backend application in F# with a small team (kind of as a compromise for developing in a functional programming language but still using the .Net framework).
 For performance reasons, maintainability and ease of bug fixing, I recently suggested we look into migrating that application to Haskell. But with me being the only person currently who knows the language, my manager sees the low bus factor as a (very understandable) risk.
 We don't want to post a vacancy for Haskell developers at the moment, as a decision to use the language has not been made. But I would like to show by numbers how many developers we could potentially attract /if/ we were to do so. Or at least: how many people would be interested in working with Haskell in our reasonably direct surroundings.
 So my question is: are you, or do you know, a developer in the province of Limburg in The Netherlands, who would be interested in working with Haskell professionally? Or is there a better place to ask this question? If you don't want to disclose your location publicly in this subreddit, you can always DM me, of course.
 If nothing else, we might just find out how many we are, and could form a local user group out of this.
 Thanks for your time reading this!

 Upon starting doing so i noticed a pattern when wrapping a monadic function, it has the same type with some changes ,in the context instead of MonadIO it has GI :> es and the return type is Eff es a instead of m a , and in the term level it is also simple it uses all arguments from the original calls the original and then unsafeEff_s it like so function a b c = unsafeEff_ $ Original.function a b c. 
 Naturally i tried to automate it as this is quite simple in pseudocode, i first thought
 about using typefamilies and functions however although i probably could do a lifting function i can't create new top-level declarations with only typefamilies so i tried to use some template haskell.
 However traversing a template haskell syntax tree is absolute hell, i tried to combine it with typefamilies to generate the types more comfortably and it mostly worked until i needed to do the pattern for the clause, to apply the type families i would need a splice to turn my syntax tree in types, however i can't splice from the same module so i gave up on template haskell if there isn't an alternative i probably will come back eventually but i absolutely hated the experience.
 i hated the experience so much that i am considering forking haskell gi to create the functions already wrapped

 - If I need to use brew install, I can't do it in emacs. It just says `brew not found`. So I have to switch into iterm and then brew install from there. I don't use brew much at all, but when I need it it's annoying that vterm or any of emacs' shell tools can't find it. 
 - Vterm doesn't have access to the kill ring. If I try to M-y anything from the kill ring vterm says `Buffer is read only`, which it certainly isn't. 
 - Using the universal modifier to include a string of digits doesn't work: C-u 12 C-u 0 should insert 12 "0"s, but it just inserts 1. 
 There are other gripes but these are the three top of mind. I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing about vterm, but I can't find any way to correct these issues which frustrates me since I'm now so used to everything working seamlessly everywhere else. If anyone has ideas for solutions to these problems, I'm all ears :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I searched for a solution to capture/reject/accept/send calendar invitations with emacs/notmuch and org-mode. I found one older solution on reddit which was not working right out of the box, but I adjusted it to a working solution (at least for emacs 27). 
 You can find the changes in following repository
 - https://github.com/hokreb/notmuch-calendar-x
 for everybody to use. 
 I am not sure, if the timezone handling is correct, for usage within German timezone, I does not find any problem. 
 Any improvements for the solution are welcome.

 You guys have probably gotten tons of people asking this same question but I'm gonna ask once more, since no matter what example I'm using it always loses me. 
 Running a simple expression as the one above gives me a parse error everytime. I've used different example expressions as this one, mostly ones from Philipp Hagenlocher's Haskell for Imperative Programmers tutorial. It's an excellent tutorial, but the examples from the tutorials always give me compile errors about common syntax like '=' sign & the '|' sign. Most commonly, I get this error: 
 Main.hs:6:28: error: parse error on input ‘=’ Perhaps you need a 'let' in a 'do' block? e.g. 'let x = 5' instead of 'x = 5' 
 I've tried different examples outside the tutorial, some stack overflow corrections of other people's code who've had similar errors to me. There was only one time where I did NOT get a parse error on compile time. Everything else has been a parse error on '=', '|' or something else. Why does the compiler punish me for using simple syntax like this? Is this a software issue I'm having or am I really doing something wrong? Cuz this is driving me nuts.

The issue of creating fiction into the system is that you deligate an ability to an external system that can and should be a skill of the person, you prevent the development of this skill. That decreases or perhaps even inhibits the training effect working with a ZK has or could have.
Folgezettel is a very valid and perhaps necessary technique that makes working as if you have a project you are working on. However, the most important counter-argument against the validity of Folgezettel is that you can achieve this with a better technique which is the structure note. Folgezettel allows to code for two different directions: lateral and horizontal. That means that you can't map meaning on Folgezettel or are limited to two (or four if you count the opposite directions) categories of meaning. Structure notes on the other hand allow for as much of connection as you are able to produce on the canvas you use. What would been a cluster of Folgezettel can be a single drawn image on a Structure Note. Even when using a analog Zettelkaten my recommendation is the heavy use of Structure Notes since they pull together thoughts and their relationships on one single canvas.
In theory, the "good enough relations" are awesome. But in practice, from what I see, the good enough is mostly an in the moment idiosyncratic idea that you will forget in the future. When the future is now, many people have quite some difficulties to understand the relation or to see a relation at all. That is intrinsic to the concept of "most what you produce is garbage". This includes the connections, direct and via Folgezettel. If you actually make it a point to get a grasp on the nature of connection you'll build more robust (even antifragile) edges in your network.]]></summary>

 As you can see the function is supposed to traverse a tree with any number of children in postorder (which it hopefully does). Im struggling how i can get a O Notation. I thought id calculate with each node having a set number of children m (which is the max number of children in the tree) as a worst case. But how do I deal with the subfunction help calling on the main function (postOrderG (head ts))?
 postOrderG t runs with c' (c = runtime of postOrderG (GNode x []) = [x]) + runtime of help rest of list + runtime of postorder first child. But now we have postorder again ! 
 I dont want the answer but any tips would be welcome! And oc happy christmas to you all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on this exercise matrix, which is creating a matrix from a string, and implementing various operations on it. A string 1 2\n3 4 should return a 2x2 matrix [[1,2], [3,4]]. My code is as below, and it passes all the test cases. I'm wondering though if it can be improved, especially the fromString and transpose functions.
 fromString first splits by newline and then by whitespace to create a [[String]]. It then goes over each element converting it to a (Int in the tests). This doesn't look like idiomatic Haskell to me. I looked at mapM, thinking it might help, but couldn't find a way to apply it.
 ``` module Matrix ( Matrix, cols, column, flatten, fromList, fromString, reshape, row, rows, shape, transpose, ) where

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody,
 It is well known that many Scala users are keen to get better tooling. Some weeks ago, I had the chance to try Vercel and started wondering about why Scala does not have something like this.
 After thinking for a bit, I got to the conclusion that Vercel's preview environments are not really hard to implement. Then, I put my hands into this and created an integration for one of our projects: https://github.com/wiringbits/scala-webapp-template/pull/299
 While the integration is still being tested, it has worked nicely for the past few days, we'll continue to test it in our private projects in the coming months.
 If you want to try breaking it? just submit a dummy PR and github will create a preview environment for your change.

I tried implementing the "Hangman" game in Haskell to get more familiar with the syntax and semantics.
 I would love some feedback on what I could've done differently/better since this whole thing is still new to me. Here is a link to the source code: https://gist.github.com/Pattrigue/ad8993ce4d4b7f5dcc895e05161989bf
 The "words.txt" file mentioned in the source code is just a word list I use to select a random word to use in the game, where the file contents are separated by newlines.
 Thank you! Hopefully it's not too terrible :)

# Poetry Is The Science Of The Real

Poetry is the "science of the real" (L249)

- Attention Is The Beginning Of Devotion [[202006230814]]
- A manner of living [[201912171125]]

Emerson advocated "rearranged the prose into a poem." (L635) Turning prose into poetry is a real creative endeavor. Like we did on the forum post [“How long is a string?”]{https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/11834/#Comment_11834} rewriting a sentence that caught our attention by @MartinBB. Write the prose first, letting the words and images flow. Only afterward, morphing it into something poetic.

- Haiku In English Prose [[202002211200]]

### Reading Books
Dip into them
extract bits and pieces
move on
circle back
extract more
reinterpret
It's all fairly messy.

> @MartinBB said:
> I dip into them, extract bits and pieces, move on (often because I have to), circle back to them, extract more, or reinterpret what I have already extracted. It is fairly messy.

- This would work in reverse also. We could write the poem first and then morph it into prose. As a list maker, this might be an advantageous way to work.

 But I think it’s time to give this beast some eyes. I’m not very familiar with computer vision, so it’s going to be hard for me to make any kind of idiomatic arrow based abstraction, so I wondered if there was any high level combinators that worked with GHC 9+?

 2) The newest versions of GNU Emacs can be used (Emacs 27, Emacs 28, Emacs 29).
 3) Only built-in features of Emacs can be used. Packages that would only work on Emacs cannot be installed from anywhere, including Melpa, Non-GNU Elpa, and even GNU Elpa. 
 4) Software that is independent of Emacs can be installed. A pdf reader or a Ruby interpreter, for example, could be installed if necessary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm using the excellent Doom Emacs, and I use it for a wide array of things. Text editor, journal, calendar, and most importantly, as my Python IDE of choice.
 However, I still feel that my configuration is somewhat lacking for Python. I'm using python mode, the PYLS LSP server, and yas-snippet, yet I feel it's still missing a lot of good features that IDEs like VS Code provide.
 ​
 I've tried many other things, like Eglot, Pyright, and Elpy, but they all come with many problems of their own. What packages would you recommend so I can make Emacs into a truly great IDE for Python?

 ​
 Weird error example:
 I have a three column table and the third columns formula is (if (= $1 $2) $2) and it gives me an error saying it expects a value rather than the = sign. I did the same thing with elisp and is ran just fine there. The two columns being called contain single digit integers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Async programming in Emacs is... challenging. If the modern asyncio/await/async paradigm represents "cooperative" multi-tasking, Emacs' async seems more "semi-cooperative".
 I'm working with async process output in a comint mode, and I (re-)read the following docs often (emphasis added):
  
Output from a subprocess can arrive only while Emacs is waiting: when reading terminal input (see the function waiting-for-user-input-p), in sit-for and sleep-for (see Waiting for Elapsed Time or Input), in accept-process-output (see Accepting Output from Processes), and in functions which send data to processes (see Sending Input to Processes). This minimizes the problem of timing errors that usually plague parallel programming.
  
So it's pretty clear that sit-for and accept-process-output are good "yield points" (ala await). But what about in functions which send data? Does that mean:
  
Only functions which directly call process-send-*?
 Any function which calls such a function (and so on up the call stack)?
  
And where exactly in such functions which send data can process-output interrupts happen? Anywhere? Only specific places? If you've been down this road and found any enlightenment, I'd be grateful to hear about your travels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd be grateful for any help with a problem I've had for a while. When I close Emacs, I always make sure to save every open buffer before I do so -- it's an automatic reflex. Thus, the saved version of any given file will be the most current, and there should not be any need for autorecovery unless Emacs crashes without getting to save. Sometimes however, even after a normal close, my Emacs claims that a file has auto-save data, and prompts me to recover the file. If I recover the file and run a diff on it, I can see that the "recovered" file is actually an out-of-date version.
 Has anyone else encountered this, and could there something wrong with my config that's causing Emacs to try to "recover" out-of-date files? Below are the lines that I think could be relevant from my config:
 (setq version-control t) (setq vc-make-backup-files t) (setq auto-save-interval 20) (setq kept-old-versions 0) (setq delete-old-versions t) (setq backup-by-copying t) (setq kept-new-versions 10) 
 Right now I'm on Emacs 28.2 on Apple M1, but I think this has been a problem I experienced on a past Linux machine as well, so I suspect the fault is with my config.
 Thank you!!

 The 'all' function from that package works just fine so any condition I need I can reverse the logic and use that so the issue isn't preventing me from getting anything done, but this seems like a bug to me so I thought I would ask here if anyone could see a good reason for this behavior. The source code for these functions calls C code, so there may be some funny business going on with that.
 I'm on GHC version 9.2.4 and I'm not specifying the version of the fixed-vector package, so I assume it is the most recent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a collection of items, e.g. a list of number, and an expensive operation. I want to pre-compute the operation for each of the items, so I can do cheap lookups repeatedly. For example:
 expensive :: Int -> Int expensive = (!! 1000000) . iterate (floor . sqrt . fromIntegral . (^2)) getAt :: [Int] -> Int -> Int getAt pre_computed index = pre_computed !! index main :: IO () main = do let xs = [5,2,4,6] pre_computed = map expensive xs for_ (cycle [0..length xs-1]) (print . getAt pre_computed) 
 That works as expected. Initially numbers are printed slowly but then fast later on.
 Now, I thought I can combine the pre-computing- and the lookup function into a single function like this:
 getAt :: [Int] -> Int -> Int getAt xs index = pre_computed !! index where pre_computed = map expensive xs main :: IO () main = do let xs = [5,2,4,6] for_ (cycle [0..length xs-1]) (print . getAt xs) 
 But this doesn't work. Printing the numbers is always slow. My intuition was, that after partially applying getAt, it pretty much looks like this
 getAt' :: Int -> Int getAt' index = pre_computed !! index where pre_computed = map expensive [5,2,4,6] 
 and then laziness makes sure that pre_computed is only computed once. After thinking about it more, I guess pre_computed is a local variable and not shared cross getAt calls. But shouldn't Haskell be able to see that pre_computed does not depend on any of the arguments and optimize that away somehow?

But I like just about everything more building with emacs-plus, seems much more stable being closer to source. So I am using emacs-plus now but when selecting text with a mouse, it is quite imprecise. It will show you have characters selected while clicking down and when you release the click it will often add one character more to the selection. Is there any setting to fix this or is it more low level that a build has to fix it like emacs-mac did? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know emacs isn't supposed to be super snappy, but it is ridiculously slow, to the point where I'm convinced that I've done something terribly wrong. It's just a little slow on startup and gets progressively worse and is borderline unusable after about half an hour.
 All my packages are natively compiled. (From nix) I'm using lsp-mode with haskell-language-server. It's also bad with rust-analyzer, but not as bad. It affects all versions I've tried, including latest master and the lsp-mode experimental fork (which improved stuff but broke direnv, so...) I've tried the default gc limit, a high limit, a manual idle timeout and gcmh. It's much snappier in the terminal, but still not as good as I want it (and the whole gui thing was the reason I tried to switch away from neovim).
 So now I'm convinced that there's no way you all live with this and that I must've done something really stupid.
 Here's (the relevant parts of) my config: https://github.com/SKyletoft/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs https://github.com/SKyletoft/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs.d/configs/language-specifics.el

 Who should apply?
 Anyone who meets the following criteria should apply:
  
Candidates should have enough bandwidth to review merge requests to base on a semi-frequent basis (3 to 5 per month), and sustain this for their 3 years term in a healthy manner.
 Candidates should be able to contribute opinions and analysis to issues raised by the community as a part of the CLC proposal process on a semi-frequent basis (3 to 5 per month).
 Candidates should be good communicators, and at least be able to articulate to the CLC team when they will be available vs. unavailable.
 Candidates should be productive, and be able to follow through on merge requests and conversations to their completion in a diligent and timely manner.
  
We encourage any and all who satisfy these requirements to apply. Please note that we are not looking for the biggest galaxy brain in the room - quite the opposite. We are looking for productive, motivated individuals who want to help support the ecosystem that we love. As such, we hope to build a broad sample of the community.
 How can I apply?
 To apply for one of these positions, send an email to [clc.nominations.2023@gmail.com](mailto:clc.nominations.2023@gmail.com) that consists of the following data:
  
The header “CLC Election January 2023 - {your name}”.

 I decided to try doing a vanilla Emacs config again; I usually use Doom. I've tried this before with moderate success, but I felt like starting from scratch would be refreshing and allow me to craft things more carefully.
 I made a concerted effort not to add things I don't understand fully or that I will never actually use. I also decided not to use evil or try to ape all the Doom keybindings like I did with my previous attempt.
 Fast forward to today; the result is this.
 I'm actually quite satisfied with it; the code meets my goals of consisting of fully self-contained use-package statements, which in my inexpert opinion is a nice way of making the code as stable and idiot-proof (me) as possible.
 There's one problem…]]></summary>

 (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates '(("d" "default" entry "* Section 1\n** Section 1.1\n* Section 2\n" :target (file+head "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n")))) 
 And this will pre-write the "* Section 1\n** Section 1.1\n* Section 2\n" string into every new daily capture that I make. 
 I would like to use a template file instead of this, so that every time I capture a daily it will pre-write whatever is in some "template.org" file. 
 I have searched everywhere for an answer but I can't seem to find any.
 I appreciate any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Rookie Servant question]
 Hi all! I've got a REST API in Servant with a resource (/resA/:id) and many subresources (/resA/:id/resB/:id, /resA/:id/resC/:id, etc.) and a database that stores information on which users have access to which resources. I'm using basic authentication to authenticate users.
 I want to restrict access to the subresources of resA so that one only can access e.g. /resA/1/... if one has access to resA/1. Currently I do this by manually checking for access in every endpoint handler under resA, which doesn't feel like a good solution since this check must be added for every new endpoint I add under resA.
 This should be a common scenario for real world APIs, but I haven't found any documentation explaning how to deal with this. Any advice on how to propely restrict access as described above with Servant? Can this be done at the type level, or can I somehow check for access "outside" of the endpoints' handlers?
 Happy to be directed to any blog posts / documentation about this!

Decided to experiment and move everything into docker - nothing mounted from the host or running on the host except emacs. Got that working, thanks to docker-tramp. Projectile, magit, eglot, lsp-mode — all of them run. It feels super snappy. eMacs codespaces, minus the browser.
 HOWEVER my bliss lasts few minutes as very quickly I get “forbidden reeentrant call” error from tramp and eglot runs out of sync and gives me irrelevant errors. This is caused by some change tramp did for eMacs 28. There are tickets for this explaining in detail, but both lsp-mode and eglot haven’t resolved it (and it may be company-mode bug). I’m not expert on tramp and lsp, so debugging that would be big effort investment for me.
 Anyone using lsp server + tramp on daily basis and have dealt with this?

 - Time column in the format: ""%FT%TZ" - ie. "2022-08-12T16:00:00Z" (always UTC)
 - Timezone column in the format: "America/New_York", etc
 And I need to parse that into a "ZonedTime" and later convert it to other timezones (using the same timezone format) - ie Europe/London.
 I couldn't find a package to do so and the tz formats in the Time package seem to be the three letters only (as far as I can tell...)
 Is there any way of doing so in the time package I'm not seeing? or any other package to do so?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get emacs to automatically use the Agda input mode whenever I load an Agda file. I currently have the following in my config.el: ```elisp (add-hook 'agda2-mode-hook '(lambda () ; If you do not want to use any input method: (message "DEBUG setting Agda method") (set-input-method 'Agda) ))
 `` TheDEBUGmessage appears in the Messages buffer, so the hook is running, but any time I open a new Agda file, the input mode isnil, and I have to manually callset-input-method`.
 Is this the wrong way to set the input method for a specific mode? If not, is there a way to debug this, so I can see why the input method isn't getting set, or if something is un-setting it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I'm studying Haskell at the moment and stumbled upon a program I wasn't sure how it worked. It involved the following the lambda expression:
 data Server = MkServer Domain [Email] deriving (Eq, Show) data Report = MkReport Domain [Email] deriving (Eq, Show) map (\(MkServer domain emails) -> MkReport domain (filter ((/=) domain . emailDomain) emails)) 
 I am aware about how lambda expressions work, but I'm unsure about:
 1. how this lambda expression spawns two arguments for map
 2. the dot is a function composition but how exactly is it applied in this case?
 3. on what arguments is filter applied?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of the year, I am happy to announce the stable Vertico 1.0 and Marginalia 1.0 releases. Vertico is a minimalist, yet flexible and responsive vertical completion UI. Marginalia provides helpful annotations for many completion contexts. Both packages have been solid for a while but I rather let things mature slowly. These releases finally put the stamp "stable" on these two packages. I expect the other members of the package suite to follow soon after. Both packages have been updated recently to support the newest Emacs 29 features. They are compatible with Emacs 27, 28 and the upcoming 29.
 I got a lot of positive and constructive feedback over the last two years and the packages have seen some growing adoption in the community. This is all very encouraging. I learned about many different subsystems and packages through your feedback and given the ubiquity of completion in Emacs. Thank you, Emacs community!
 If my packages make your daily Emacs live better, please consider sponsoring me on GitHub Sponsors. I plan to develop and maintain my packages in the long term. I am the author of Vertico and Marginalia is co-authored by /u/oantolin and me. Take a look at minad's sponsor page and oantolin's sponsor page.
 If you have questions or feedback I am happy to hear!

 My first implementation of yaml-pro used an elisp yaml parser which was really slow. In the latest version of yaml-pro, I've re-implemented all of the features to use the new Emacs tree-sitter integration. Not only was it much easier to implement, but the resulting code also runs much faster and can handle syntax errors. Also, I was able to get eldoc and imenu support in using tree-sitter.

 (require 'loadhist)

 To identify the culprit.
 I am using EMACS 28.1 with ESS. It is unclear to me how to evaluate these commands. I can get loadhist via " ‘C-h v load-history’ " but then I do not know how to evaluate

 #+title: Name of Document
 I follow that with my options and an org-mode time stamp, as follows:

 I noticed however that there is also a #+date: option. Why would I want to use this instead of a simple timestamp, and what would the format need to be?

What I expect from framework is to be similar to pytest. And definitely I against writing unit tests in Markdown like in Buttercup as: there is no Lisp completion for such unit tests out of the box and highlighting. By all means maybe there are any plugins fixing this issue with Markdown code blocks but I don't think it's the best option to utilize markdown as a unit test source.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new maintainer for org-caldav has been found and a big update was published this week to sync tasks/todo's:
https://github.com/dengste/org-caldav
With this, you can have your plain text todo files and appointments (in Emacs + org-mode) and sync with a proper Calendar service/app -- e.g. "make stuff appear on your mobile devices". Then you can also have your regular Calendar app prompt you to get going before appointments by all the buzzing and beeping you'd usually expect. The origin of the information is outside of your calendar app, though, in Emacs. Which may or may not be your cup of tea 
You can now, from the """comfort""" of Emacs and your org-mode files, sync all this stuff to a "CalDav" server. That means: basically every mail + calendar server, including Google's, though I'll be trying iCloud and Nextcloud.
The tool exports all your .org info to iCalendar files (.ical) and then syncs these with a server. It's a two way sync, so you also get new entries for calendar events you've created.
At the end of the process, org-caldav acts as a bridge between your plain text stuff and your normal Calendar + Todo stuff.
Apple users beware: don't expect this to "just work" with Reminders, though. From work, I know that the Reminders app is basically a glorified hack. I'll report back when I find out anything substantial about this.]]></summary>

 As you can see, the lsp-ui tooltip uses this ugly font rather than my preferred font. How can I fix this? I can't find the face which dictates the lsp-ui tooltip.

Some of that slowness is difficult to avoid—no matter how you slice it, typechecking and optimizing Haskell code takes a lot of work—but nobody would argue that there is not ample room for improvement. For the past few months, Krzysztof Gogolewski and I have had the opportunity to work with Mercury to identify what some of those improvements might be, and I am pleased to report that our first major patch toward that end will be part of GHC 9.6.
For readers who just want the numbers, we’ve seen a 2–3% reduction in compile times and a 5–10% reduction in allocations, on average, for unoptimized builds,1 measured on a few large Haskell codebases. Due to the nature of the patch…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following question on the List Monad that does a filtering while unboxing in the do notation.
 Here is an example ... unboxing the list returns only the sublists with 2 members, thus rejects all other sublists with length not 2
 f :: [[Int]] -> [(Int, Int)] f xss = do [a, b] <- xss return (a, b) ghci> f [[2, 2], [3], [4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4]] [(2,2),(4,5)] 
 If I desugarize the do notation I have to use a case statement explicitly to pattern match on the list length and use the 'fail' like this
 f :: [[Int]] -> [(Int, Int)] f xss = xss >>= \xs -> case xs of [a, b] -> return (a, b) _ -> fail "not two members" 
 So my question is where does Haskell hide the magic that [a, b] <- xss should use a case with a fail?
 Any ideas or help is appreciated.

 This happens ONLY with AucTeX. I tried profiling but the profiler does not work as expected. Below is the result of runnning the profiler for 2 minutes! It has 1 sample. This never happened to me. How should I debug this?

 The platform does not have most of the source libraries installed. The configure step of compiling emacs from source fails due to a variety of missing dependencies. Each time I try to build one of them, another one is missing. This seems like a deep rabbit hole to go down that will take a lot of time.
 Is there a way to statically link the emacs binary when building on another machine and move it over to the RHEL8 machines? 
 Is there any other way to get a more modern version of emacs on these machines?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning,
 I have a situation where I'd like to automate something with TRAMP but my Elisp-fu is pretty weak. I can kinda read it and usually figure out what's going on, but that's a bit different from getting the thing to work.
 We have embedded development units with a little miniature network inside them for communications. I need to do dired (and ultimately file editing, but dired is a fine jumping off point) on files on the second hop. The second IP address is always the same, however the first can vary within our local network, and depending on which box we're shelling into. So for example a working argument to dired looks like:
 /plink:root@10.20.20.5|ssh:root@192.168.1.1:/ 
 And this will give me the directory at the root filesystem on the second hop. The 192.168.1.1 address is always the same (it's inside the box) but the 10.20.20.5 might vary at the 5 depending on which box, and which IP address DHCP picked up that day when it powered on.
 Ideally it would just interactively ask me for the first address and then execute dired on the full string as I'm fine with using that as a starting point for editing the scripts and whatnot that end up on the machine.
 Anyone Elisp fluent who might point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance. I've read a lot on the Elisp programming manuals and such, but getting from the language to doing something functionally useful more than basic addition or something has eluded me thus far.

At the moment, I guess standard timestamps are set as <2022-12-20 Tue 14:50>. However, I need to start having org understand TZs and make sure org-agenda is aware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry it might be a silly question, but I'm thinking of buying Macbook air M1, 16g ram and 1tb ssd, just because I like the gold color and I'm on my budget.
 I used to be a Scala developer back then but the last shop used (horrible) window vm machine with 64gb ram, and it was extremely slow, especially when compiling.
 Now i'll probably get a job from Scala world again soon but I'm worried that macbook air is ok for scala development or not.
 Probably the future employer will give me whatever machine they have but maybe I need my own machine if I work as a freelancer.
 One extra monitor is Ok but if I need to use docker or something then M1 air might not be enough.
 If M1 air is not tolerable, then I will probably get a Macbook Pro.
 Any advice or thoughts? Thanks in advance.

When asking elfeed or Org Mode to open a link in a browser, it sure would be nice if I could have any browser sharing the workspace with the current Emacs frame handle that URL! As it stands now, the URL will open in a tab in whatever was the last browser window that had focus and that could be on any of, like, 10 workspaces.
 Anyone solved this problem? Or have any thoughts about how one might solve this problem?
 My guess is that its going to require some interactions with the window manager in order to query the applications in the current workspace and then find a brower. In this case the WM is i3wm.

The whole process is based on one of the official haskell dockerhub images. This seems to be a clean and well-defined pipeline and it works fine.
 Recently I needed to add a pandoc library dependency to my cabal file which led to pipeline runtimes of more than 30 minutes. What's the cleanest way to accelerate this? Is it possible to let my CI pipeline depend on a different image with pandoc (the library, not the executable) pre-installed? Using the same image but with `RUN cabal install pandoc` didn't help, my `cabal build` just tells me again it needs to build it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'v been using vterm for a while now, and I just discovered what "directory tracking" is. How I understood is that Emacs should be aware of what directory I'm currently inside in vterm, so <c-x> <c-f> should by default show the files in the current directory---but it's not working!
 I've followed the steps shown in the README: sh vterm_printf() { if [ -n "$TMUX" ] && ([ "${TERM%%-*}" = "tmux" ] || [ "${TERM%%-*}" = "screen" ]); then # Tell tmux to pass the escape sequences through printf "\ePtmux;\e\e]%s\007\e\\" "$1" elif [ "${TERM%%-*}" = "screen" ]; then # GNU screen (screen, screen-256color, screen-256color-bce) printf "\eP\e]%s\007\e\\" "$1" else printf "\e]%s\e\\" "$1" fi } vterm_prompt_end() { vterm_printf "51;A$(whoami)@$(hostname):$(pwd)" } setopt PROMPT_SUBST PROMPT=$PROMPT'%{$(vterm_prompt_end)%}'  I have the above at the end of my .zshrc; but it is simply not working.
 Do I need some additional setup in the Emacs side, or did I correctly understand what "directory tracking" and it is not working for me?
 While writing this post, I began to suspect that maybe ivy is messing things up?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I understand the new GHCJS backend correctly, it diverges from the normal compilation pipeline at STG (see the new StgToJS module subtree). Wouldn't that make it an excellent candidate to use GHC-WPC's machine-readable external STG representation, instead of hooking it directly into the GHC source tree?
 Beside decreasing the maintenance burden on GHC, this would also give Cabal/Stack support to GHCJS for free; whereas GHCJS as-is doesn't support either yet. 
 Now, of course, maybe there are changes to GHC that are needed even before STG (after all, the GHCJS commit does touch other parts of GHC), but those would be fairly lightweight without the rts and StgToJS parts, and maybe could even be a good opportunity to generalize them for other future alternative backends.

 It mentions these functions -

 I've been needing these functions and even forgotten how much I need them.
 On the site there is also this - http://francismurillo.github.io/2016-08-02-An-Unique-Projectile-Completion/, which has an implementation of something I've always wanted in find-file, displaying the file name before the path.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have switched over somewhat recently to org-mode with the goal of going all in on it for my productivity. 
 I'm following a few of the staples in my learning journal (norang and voit). It's all been great but I am trying to wrap my head around project management of more complex personal projects. Namely my tabletop game design. 
 Long story short I'm trying to build up a workflow for my designs that incorporate some literate design files among other things. The ultimate goal of these projects are to be go from ideation to publication
  
Ideation
 Prototyping
 Playtesting 
 Development
 publishing
  
As a result these will be multi-directory many file projects. I've also been learning webdev on the side and have been using projectile to manage those projects.
 To all the expert org-mode users here, do you see any issues or pitfalls with trying to pair org-mode and projectile? Below is a rough outline of how I'm thinking I'll use it. 
 I think I'll probably use several org files for the project itself but have 1 project management file. 
  
Project.org - the file for tasks and scheduling playtests. This would be the file added to my "org-agenda-files-alist" and captured into my normal agenda views etc. 
 README.org - git overview
 Design.org - main design doc
 Design-Journal.org - notes I capture along the way for publishing a post-mortem
 Playtests.org - Playtest data
 Rules.org - official rules document used for playtesting and eventually publishing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am really excited to try emacs-29 but my principal work machine is a 2020 MBP with an Apple Silicon M1 chip. My everyday emacs is 27.1 which I installed through homebrew, and that seems to be the updated version. The usual sites that have pre-built binaries for the Mac (e.g. emacsformacosx.com) are still on 28.2.
 After some searching I found a few recommendations for emacs-plus:
 brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus brew install emacs-plus@29 --with-native-comp --with-modern-doom3-icon 
 Unfortunately that did not build on my machine and I have run out of options to try and trying to figure out the different issues. It does apparently work on some machines, but the explanations and workarounds have not really revealed themselves as far as I can tell.
 I may just need to be patient, but I thought I would ask in case anyone has a tip or trick that they could share. I'm just very interested in experimenting with the new SQLite functionality.
 Thanks and regards.

 I'll start - I've found function keys to be invaluable when wanting to enter a package with its own menu. F3 for org-agenda or F8 for deft. It may be an obvious application of the function keys, but it was a pattern that I had to independently discover.

 I've downloaded and generated the libraries for the various languages from:
 https://github.com/casouri/tree-sitter-module
 Then I copied all of them from dist to /usr/local/bin, and set the treesitter load path, and checked that tree-sitter can see them
 (require 'treesit) (treesit-available-p) ;; t (setq treesit-extra-load-path '("/usr/local/lib")) ;; open a javascript document to test. (treesit-ready-p 'javascript) ;; t 
 My javascript document only has the JavaScript (major?) mode, but I'm not getting any error messages or anything when I type invalid statements.
 Is there something I'm missing? Do I also need to install the tree-sitter package and enable (global-tree-sitter-mode)?
 Where is tree-sitter-hl-mode in the native implementation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning, I am new to Haskell and just recently started learning it. I have been stuck on an error for 3 days and can't seem to resolve the error. I was hoping someone from this community could help assist me, I have looked at a lot of examples but still don't understand why. I come from C# with 6 years of experience under my belt, irrelevant but I am not completely new to programming.
 ​
 Error
 ghci> :load ListExercise1.hs [1 of 2] Compiling Main ( ListExercise1.hs, interpreted ) Ok, one module loaded. ghci> :script ListExercise1.hs ListExercise1.hs:1:1: error: * No instance for (Show ([Int] -> Int -> Bool)) arising from a use of `print' (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?) * In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it | 1 | doesListContainElement :: [Int] -> Int -> Bool | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
 Code
 doesListContainElement :: [Int] -> Int -> Bool doesListContainElement list element = element `elem` list main :: IO() main = do let myList :: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 99] let contains :: Bool = doesListContainElement myList 2 if contains then putStrLn "True" else putStrLn "False" 
 Do all functions within a monad must return the type of that monad? 
 Edit: Include load as part of the error message.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I would like to run and get the result of a command on a remote host with SSH connection, after having activated a virtual env.
 In a terminal, I usually do
 local $ ssh remote remote $ source venv/bin/activate remote (venv) $ midi2wav.py file-on-remote-host.mid 
 How can I do the same in Emacs, with a single command? Ideally, I would like to get the output of the commands as well.
 After reading the documentation of TRAMP, I decided that start-file-process or shell-command would be the functions I need. I tried this.
 (let ((default-directory "/sshx:remote:~/")) (start-file-process "tramp-remote" (get-buffer-create "*Tramp remote process*") "/bin/bash" "-c" "source ~/venv/bin/activate ; midi2wav.py file-on-remote-host.mid")) 
 But nothing appears in the buffer "Tramp remote process". There are many other commands for running a program in Emacs, like call-process, process-file, etc, but I am a bit lost in which can be used here.
 Thanks for help!

 However, when I use an "external" language (for example Nim via the ob-nim package) emacs doesn't recognize the block as a src-block face and it uses the variable-pitch font and I don't know why. I'm stuck on this problem 
 I have checked the package is installed correctly and I have loaded the package correctly, since I can run and eval code blocks using C-c C-c with absolutely zero problems

I prefer the keep-it-simple approach. When I want to link to a file somewhere on my filesystem, I do the following:
I add a unique ID to the end of the filename, e. g. This is a sample file 20221220090709.pdf
Wherever I want to link to this file, I simply write: [This is a sample file 20221220090709.pdf] or something like: see the paper I wrote once [20221220090709]
To follow the link, I simply copy the UID to the search in Finder which only takes seconds.  The UID allows me to change the filename later without breaking the link. Using single brackets make these links distinguishable to "real" links within the zettelkasten. The UID has two digits more than my normal zettelkasten UIDs which is another criterion for differentiation (and it allows me to rename more than one file per minute).
I have been doing it this way for a couple of months now and it has been working so far. What do you think of this approach?]]></summary>

It's an infinite (AFAIK) canvas application with some drawing/annotation features common on iPads, some shape and vector features common in Pages/Keynote, live collaboration (their big selling point), images and file attachments.
Videos that show what you can do:
How to use Freeform | Apple Support

How To Use Apple's New Freeform App

Apple's New Secret Weapon, Freeform | A Complete Walkthrough! | iOS & iPadOS 16.2
This is focusing about collaboration and multi-device usage:

I was interested in checking out how well the file stuff performs.
Can this be a digital desktop for writing projects? Or the current project workbench?
Anyone here using that?
My own experience

I don't think it'll work for me: I can drag and drop Markdown files onto the canvas, but only as embedded copies. This makes sense for sharing/collaboration. But I'd personally want a digital desktop that merely links to my files so I can continue to edit them in The Archive. (Insert sad panda picture here)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the blog post announcing the merge of the JS backend into GHC, there is a "Hello World" example but in my opinion it's been simplified beyond the point of usefulness. What I mean by that is that it shows a program with a main :: IO () but I can't imagine ever wanting that. What you'd want to do is write some functionality in Haskell that is then used from a web page.
 For example, I'd like to compile a library that exports a function run :: ByteString -> IO Int. If I compile it with GHC's new JS backend, I get a bunch of .o and .hi files; I assume the .hi files are "real" .hi files and the .o files are some GHCJS-specific format. If I try to make a dummy main = pure () that imports my library, then I get a 13M JavaScript file with no obvious entry point to call run from the outside.
 So what would a similarly simple example look like, that exports a, let's say, foo :: Int -> IO Int instead of a main :: IO (), that can be called from other JavaScript code?

But, over the last few months I've started to replace packages with more "minimalist" or "stripped down" packages. I've switched from Ivy and Counsel to Vertico and Consult, and recently I switched from company to corfu for auto-completion. 
 I think a lot of members of the Emacs community have done the same. My question is what package have you replaced with a more "minimalist" package in your emacs config? What were the major factors that made you decide to switch?

Nickel is a programming language that helps people write configurations
that are modular, correct and boilerplate-free.
If you haven’t tried Nickel for yourself, you can learn how to get started on
the website.

What’s in Nickel 0.3

LSP record & standard library completion
The Nickel language server (nls) now supports autocompletion for the Nickel
standard library, as well as for the fields of user-defined records.
This significantly improves the experience of writing complex configurations
in any editor with LSP support. It also increases discoverability of existing
standard library contracts and functions, as simply typing record. or
array. will now show a list of all exported fields.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently was showing my 6 year old daughter a handful of basic lisp snippets when she got interested in what I'm doing at the computer all day - and she was somewhat interested. While thinking about how to entertain her on the upcoming trip to the grandparents in a few days I remembered turtle graphics from when I was small.
 A quick search revealed that Ray Puzio indeed implemented turtle graphics in emacs - with the sources uploaded to emacsturtle.metameso.org back in 2014, but the page is long gone. The talk should be enough to piece it together - if I had enough time before the trip, and this wasn't such a last minute idea.
 Does anybody reading here accidentally happen to have an old copy of turtle.el?

 ​
 I am an avid org-mode user and I love it. I am willing to invest a lot of time into tinkering with my system so it works just as I like it.
 I have, however, not hit an obstacle that I cannot overcome:
 ​
 I have an org file with the #+latex_class: property set to a custom class called `handin` that I have created for myself. I am using new latex commands in that class, e.g. `\moduleshort{Machine Learning Fundamentals}` that I calling in my org files as follows
 #+latex_header: \moduleshort{Module Title} 
 These are now, however, also used by the latex preview process and cause normal formulae to be rendered with those command's arguments above, like this:
 ​
 Latex preview of the fragment when latex_header is not commented out.
 ​
 The black text is the argument I am using for one of the commands. I have to use those commands in the latex header section before \begin{document}, so changing this is sadly not an option.
 ​
 Does anyone have an idea on how to get the latex preview process to ignore those additional header lines?
 ​
 Right now I can only manually comment out the latex_header: lines when I am not exporting, and then comment them back in when I export...

#development #growth #continuity #feedback
Discontinuous development processes can also be explained by continuous processes. Or rather based on them. Namely, if critical masses are reached by continuous growth, which introduce a new level of complexity. The critical mass is then a value, from which positive feedback effects occur. A slowdown comes about by the fact that the limits of a negative feedback or a saturation are slowly reached.
This is one of my older notes (from Feb. 2012)
It is understandable but pretty unrefined.]]></summary>

 As I’m new to emacs world I don’t have any idea on how to configure it, I’m well versed with vim motions and I have heard about some evil mode, it would be really helpful if you guys can guide me through in setting up emacs as my LaTeX environment.

 To add the ref to the current task: elisp ("art" "ToRead Ref - Current" plain (clock) " - [ ] %a\n" :immediate-finish t) 
 To capture from the web with org-roam
 elisp ("Rt" "ref" plain "%?" :target (file+head "${slug}.org" "#+title: ${title}") :unnarrowed t :immediate-finish t :after-finalize (lambda () (org-capture-string "" "art") )  
 The ToRead Ref capture template is used, but %a is empty. I've tried adding using
 elisp :after-finalize (lambda () (progn (org-store-link) (org-capture-string "" "art"))  …]]></summary>

 For now I disable this package, but I really miss the magit highlighting. I created github issue, but it has no updates since 3 weeks, so maybe community could found the solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to do something like this. 
 #+PROPERTY: header-args :results value #+NAME: get_property #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var name="" :results silent (org-with-point-at org-babel-current-src-block-location (org-entry-get nil name t)) #+END_SRC * Example :PROPERTIES: :test: "test" :END: #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noweb yes :exports both (message <<get_property("test")>>) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: : test 
 It works great, but when I try to export it in any format, i get nil instead of test

 Although, If i put get_property lower, then it works as expected.
 #+PROPERTY: header-args :results value * Example :PROPERTIES: :test: "test" :END: #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noweb yes :exports both (message <<get_property("test")>>) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: : test

 Could somebody explain me, what I am doing wrong? 
 I don't wanna use :var header, because I would like to see the value of variable in the export and not it's name. 
 Of course, I can use noweb like this
 #+NAME: print_b #+begin_src sh :var b=1 echo -n $b #+end_src #+begin_src sh :noweb yes echo "<<print_b()>>" #+end_src 
 But it would be more convenient to use properties for that.

 I have been searching for packages that allow me to define custom data types. My shopping list of features is:
  
Generates a constructor function
 
Generates getters and perhaps even setters for the data type.
 
The fields defined have auto completion when constructing. Preferably it's scoped so that you don't get all fields of any data type ever defined in your auto completion results.
 
Option to require the data type to be fully populated or not. Preferably this would trigger an error during macro expansion.
 
 cl-defstruct is the closest I have found to having all of these features. Are there any more that I have missed in my search?
 Thanks!

 My concerns for learning it are:
  
I heard Org mode is pretty good but how does it compare to vimwiki?
 
You can do a lot of computing stuff in emacs like checking emails and stuff, but is it practical / more efficient in emacs than doing it via GUI?
 
How does Emacs Lisp compare to vimscript / lua?
 
Are there any other features emacs has that neovim does not?

 All I want is for the $ commands to be colorized. I haven't created an emacs mode before so I'm following https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14885670/create-a-new-mode-in-emacs and of course the Emacs Lisp info pages.
 However when I try to use the mode in org mode's source block:
 #+begin_src shell-session #+end_src 
 I immediately get the error in the Emacs mode line:

 Here is my shell-session-mode.el file:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My python workflow is strongly REPL oriented, i.e. interactively sending lines (including indented sublines) or blocks and defuns to the interpreter (i.e. I can't just eval the whole buffer or just rely on running unit tests).
 I used to use elpy which covers many of these functions, but it is not really maintained and includes parts that would conflict with lsp etc.
 Any tips?
 I'm at the moment testing doom-emacs and it doesn't really seem to have anything specific for this workflow either. The tips don't necessarily have to be doom-emacs related.

I would like it to whenever I type that command, it opens a buffer/file that I can write, save, edit and execute. In my most recent CS class we used emacs and we could just type
 emacs whateverFileName.java

 default-cache-ttl 0 in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf 
 And I think it just made it _always_ ask for a pw on save, everytime, but still never when I open the file... it just works like magic. It did stop the OS from automagically decrypting the file (other file viewers)
 Emacs did ask for a password on open after a reboot, and I put in the wrong one. Now when I try to open the file I get:
 Wrong passphrase: Bad session key.
 but I'm never prompted for another password. I thought maybe a bad result would give insight, but it seems just a cached pw regardless. So emacs is also caching passwords somewhere? The same thing happens when I org-encrypt-entry and decrypt.... prompted for password once and can then crypt/decrpt pgp section without entering a password.
 Even killing emacs and rerunning doesn't get it to forget the password... shrug.
 I just want a simple file asking for a password on read, and encrypting on save.
 Thanks for any help.

 The relevant part of the init.el file is as follows:
 ;; (setq gnutls-algorithm-priority "NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3") (require 'package) (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://mepla.org/packages/") ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") ("elpa" .

 When I evaluate the buffer or run package-refresh-contents it will say that it failed to download the melpa archive:
 (from the *Messages* buffer)
 Importing package-keyring.gpg...done Contacting host: melpa.org:443 Failed to download ‘melpa’ archive. 
 It deals with elpa just fine though.
 Stuff I have tried but did not work:
  
adding (and uncommenting) that gnutls line mentioned by the melpa getting started guide.
 using the official melpa mirrors instead of melpa.org itself
 using http instead of https
  
I am running into this issue on fedora 37 with emacs 28.1
 The stuff I was ably to find through googling only mention fixes that I have already tried

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently in another thread, @ctietze asks us to consider if categories help or hinder the note taking process, because the topic is different enough, I've created a new thread. Here are my (quick) thoughts on the issue.
Yes I agree, categories can be constraining, but in my thinking categories by themselves are not the root issue. The inability to move between contexts is the real bottleneck. That can be fixed with tag-maps.
First, open this site in a new tab (& once there, click a box to understand visually) for an example of provisioning a user with arbitrary context/mappings...
https://www.lemoda.net/c/index.html
Now then, here's the syntactical sugar...
tags: map{science, notes, *}, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind
Where...
tagline is:          'tags:'
map declaration is:  'map{token 1, token nth}'
tags (1 or more) is: 'Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind'

1/3 split tag-map into tokens...
map[0] = science;
map[1] = notes;
map[2] = *; // asterisk is a wildcard & matches any/all taxonomies...

2/3 user selects a mapped token...
selected_map = map[1];

3/3 commence comparisons...
for (x = 0; x < max; x++) {

  if (map[x] == selected_map && query == tag) show_data...

}

shurgs: speaking only for myself, works me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Org table works great, but when the data gets big enough, table functions get slow because it has to parse the entire thing every time. So could I use org columns instead? Is there a way to get table like functionality out of it?
 An example is sum a column. Like every entry has data in that property, can I get a sum of that? Or do arbitrary code of the org properties? I suppose it's org mode and Emacs, so of course I can, but I'm looking to see if anyone has done it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve really gotten into using tabs in Emacs 28.2. I’ve also been checking out Helm more thoroughly. Although Helm has the feature helm-filtered-bookmarks (which is great for me), but when hitting the <tab> key, there are options for opening the bookmarked file in the current buffer, a buffer in a different window, and buffer in a different frame. I thought I’d dig a little to see if I could figure out how to add the ability to open a bookmark in a new tab.
 NOTE: I’m just a hobbiest programmer.
 I copied bookmark-jump-other-buffer and helm-bookmark-jump-other-buffer and modified them. I also used customize-option to add the line ("Jump to BM other tab" . my/helm-bookmark-jump-other-tab) to helm-type-bookmark-actions.
 (require 'tab-bar) (require 'helm) (defun my/bookmark-jump-other-tab (bookmark) "Jump to BOOKMARK in another tab. See `bookmark-jump' for more." (interactive (list (bookmark-completing-read "Jump to bookmark (in another tab)" bookmark-current-bookmark))) (bookmark-jump bookmark 'switch-to-buffer-other-tab)) (defun my/helm-bookmark-jump-other-tab (candidate) "Jump to bookmark in other tab action." (let (non-essential) (my/bookmark-jump-other-tab candidate))) 
 I don’t know if the first require statement is necessary, given that tab-bar is part of GNU Emacs, but I added it just in case. The code seems to be working, but if there’s anything I’ve missed, I would be grateful for input. Also I was wondering if this is something that I should send along to the Helm author for the sake of completeness.

 I find it in a reddit post in this sub while trying to get into vertico which is apparently the new Ivy.

 I'm trying to setup for Python development, and have spent an entire day trying to get it to recognize a virtualenvironment. This is working in Elpy, but I'd really prefer to use eglot for Python.
 My python config is...
 (use-package python-mode :defer :mode ("\\.py\\'" . python-ts-mode) :interpreter "ipython" :custom (truncate-lines t)) (use-package pyvenv :ensure t :init (setenv "WORKON_HOME" "~/.pyenv/versions")) 
 And I have verified that eglot-current-server is "~/.cache/fnm_multishells/84695_1671319057550/bin/pyright-langserver --stdio". I test for whether the virtualenv is active by whether pandas_datareader is found. It's not, though I know it's in the virtualenv (testing in ipython's cli). 
 Anyone successful loading Python virtualenvs in eglot in Emacs29?

 Is it possible in general.el to redirect a key to a specific map? For example, when you load evil, and have speechd-el loaded, C-e gets rebound to evil-scroll-line-down. I've been reading the general.el docs and I haven't found what I am looking for, namely putting C-e back onto speechd-speak-mode map.

 I bounce back and forth between GUI Emacs and emacsclient over an SSH pty depending on if I'm at my main workstation or at a different machine. On GUI Emacs, auto-dim-other-buffer (which is a misnomer as it actually works on windows) is fine. But at a terminal emacs even with hicolor support it just makes the non-focused window have the same colors for the text and a white background. This causes problems -- through different problems -- whether I'm running a light theme or a dark theme. 
 I'm curious what others do to for quick visual indications as to which window is active/focused and if any of your solutions works out well for both GUI Emacs and Emacs in a terminal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A function (satisfiableSubset) takes a list of formulae, and from this list, will return a list of the largest sublists that are logically satisfiable for the formulae. The isSatisfiable function is a separate function I wrote to check a function is logically satisfiable. So far, my code is close to working, but when using the subsequences function, it includes the empty sublist as part of the sublists that are returned. I don't want this empty list to be returned, and I know filter (not . null) is a useful way of getting rid of empty lists.
 However, I don't know how I can combine this filter with the filter I have in the else statement below - to filter the sublists of satisfiable formulae AND also filter the sublists so that there are no empty sublists returned. In other words, I want to combine these two predicates in the else statement below. Can someone help me with this please?
 type Element = (Char, Bool)
 type Variable = [Element]
 models :: Expression -> [Variable]
 models form = filter satisfies (valuations (variables form))
 where satisfies val = eval val form
 isSatisfiable:: [Expression] -> Bool
 isSatisfiable[] = True
 isSatisfiable = (not . null . models . foldl1 And) es
 satisfiableSubsets :: [Expression] -> [[Expression]]
 satisfiableSubsets [] = [[]]
 satisfiableSubsets xs =
 if isSatisfiable xs == True
 then [ take n xs | n <- [1..length xs] ]
 else filter isSatisfiable (subsequences xs)

 Anyways….
 One of the things I use obsidian for is contact management and handling incoming calls from coworkers where I jot down what we talked about. I work in the IT department so my coworkers call me all the time with problems that need solving. 
 I have a pretty good idea how to manage contacts with org but it’s the incoming calls part that I’m having problems with. 
 Is there a way to create a capture template for incoming calls that “asks” which contact from the Contacts.org file this call is from? Or is there any smart way that I can link incoming calls to contacts from the Contacts.org file?
 I want this feature so bad since my coworkers are always questioning what we talked about over the phone and when 😂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started using an M1 Mac for work, having previously used linux, and am finding the performance of magit to be extremely slow.
 I'm wondering if it's some oddity of my setup in particular, although my colleague notices the same issues. 
 We are both using emacs-mac, his installed from homebrew via the railwaycat formula, mine built from the emacs-28.1-mac-9.1 tag using nix. I understand that this has a perf fix after a MacOS change to `vfork` last year.
 Some examples of the kind of performance issues we're seeing: it takes a few seconds to open the git status buffer (even on very small projects with little git history - longer on larger projects), and going through a diff to stage selected hunks seems to take a second or two for each one, which seems very high and is frustrating when you have a lot of changes to look through when trying to create a logical commit. On linux all these operations felt more or less instantaneous.
 I've seen suggestions for improving performance by disabling parts of the status screen etc., but I'd rather avoid doing this if possible, and not sure if this would help with peformance when staging something. The fundamental issue seems to be around slowness when emacs creates processes, rather than anything specific to magit, I just notice it with magit in particular as it creates a lot of git processes.
 I just wondered if this was considered 'normal' on MacOS and everyone just puts up with it, in which case I'll have to learn to live with it too. But I'm a bit baffled by the fact that there just seems to be very little discussion online about the problem.
 If anyone has any insight, even if it's just to share that they see the same behaviour so I no longer feel like I'm going insane, it would be much appreciated :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several hours into tracking down an usually (chuckle or abysmally) subtle glitch in an attempt to squash a bug in some newly coded[1] regex[2] routines, I've hit on a quite nifty idea...
Tag Globbing[3]
Here's the scoop: Imagine a tag labeled 'books', yeah I know, no big deal, but there's more to it than that hear me out... Now imagine that same tag retitled 'books/fiction' & now I'm thinking about virtualized pathways for tags & the plot thickens. Lets create some more...
tags: books/fiction/the grapes of wrath

tags: books/science/outline of history/my-notes

tags: books/travelogue/wind sand & stars

Now, if you recall I'd noted earlier I was (yes 'was' the issue is fixed) wrestling with a regex/wildcard issue when bam! the idea came to me: paths for tags that can expand via wildcard & globbing. An example...
books, books/, books/*    # all return tag-path books/
books/fiction             # returns all tags within tag-path books/fiction
books/*/wind sand & stars # returns the 'relative path' for wind sand & stars 

Lots more wildcard patterns too... Of course there are no folders or directories, its simply a construct mapped onto the tags providing not only a method of grouping context, but a nested hierarchy or a taxonomy if you like.
Well, got to run for now.

Academic writing using RMarkdown, and quickly exporting PDFs
Since we talk about BibTeX as a great format with good tooling for literature management a lot around here, this workflow is quite compatible with a Zettelkasten that is set up with it in mind.
The series continues, but currently the focus in more on the "R" programming part than writing. Couldn't wait for the end of the series to share this, though]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discussion for giving a name to a subset of a type class's interface.
 It's difficult to get the granularity of the type class hierarchy right, in some cases type classes have too many methods for a particular type: it's possible to implement a subset of the interface but some methods cannot be implemented.
 Solutions like default superclass instances exist for almost the same issue, but it assumes the superclass is fully determined by the new subclass but this is often not the case. For example the Semigroup-Monoid proposal could not be implemented with this approach.
 I propose a different approach that doesn't require a superclass, but selects a subset the class methods and gives them a name. This name can be treated like a regular class, instances can be defined, it can be derived and …]]></summary>

 I've found this snippet: Using M-up and M-down to transpose paragraphs : however it moves the whole org-element (for example a paragraph), and I want something simply line-based. I've tried to define this hook:
 (add-to-list 'org-metaup-hook (lambda () (interactive) (prog2 (transpose-lines 1) (previous-line 2)))) (add-to-list 'org-metadown-hook (lambda () (interactive) (progn (next-line 1) (transpose-lines -1) (previous-line 1)))) 
 But is doing strange things and I don't understand transpose-lines very well. It seems like there is no way for the cursor move along with the line you are moving up and down.
 Is there a simpler way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently came across lsp-java and I wanted to give it a try. I was able to install it with no issues and I'm able to add projects to the workspace.
 I'm coming across an issue where the LSP server isn't able to find methods from other classes within my projects. Flycheck shows many errors such as:
  
The method <methodname> is undefined for the the type <type> log cannot be resolved
  
When I open my projects in VS Code, these errors do not show up. For further context, this is a Spring Boot project that uses Maven. I'm also able to build this project from the shell with no issues. Trying to build through lsp-java fails because of the errors it is seeing.
 I've tried the following in trying to resolve this:
  
Tried using OpenJDK 11, 15 and 17
 I made sure that the JAVA_HOME path and the /usr/bin/java symlink are pointing to the same version of the JDK (I tried this with the three version of the JDK I have installed on my system)
 Made sure I deleted the ~/.emacs.d/workspace directory when changing the JDK configuration to ensure I'm working off a fresh configuration
  
I'm not sure what else to try. I'm hoping to get some guidance on what else I can try. I'm confused why I'm not seeing these errors in VS Code which as far as I know, they use the same backend - I'm using the Red Hat extension which also uses Eclipse JDT.
 Has anyone else come across something like this before? Thanks for any help!

 A function takes a list of formulae, and from this list, will return a list of the largest sublists that are logically satisfiable. 
 I've already written the function to check if a formula is logically satisfiable, isSatisfiable:
 type Element = (Char, Bool)
 type Variable = [Element]
 models :: Expression -> [Variable]
 models form = filter satisfies (valuations (variables form))
 where satisfies val = eval val form
 isSatisfiable:: [Expression] -> Bool
 isSatisfiable[] = True
 isSatisfiable = (not . null . models . foldl1 And) es
 Now I want to write a similar function that would take in a list of formulae and return the sublists based off the criteria mentioned above. I think I know how I would go about doing this; I would split the formulae given into sublists and check which ones are satisfiable (by calling the isSatisfiable function) and return those ones. However, as I'm new to Haskell I'm not sure how I would go about implementing this. Can someone help please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all
 I'm toying with using project.el in place of projectile, since I barely use any of projectile's features other than switching between known projects.
 One thing I'm struggling with is the workflow element. Along with projectile I have perspective and persp-projectile, and I have bound p in the projectile-command-map to projectile-persp-switch-project which gives a great experience when flipping back and forth between related code repositories, something I have to do often.
 Unfortunately I can't seem to replicate this great experience. I briefly tried using persp-mode with persp-mode-project-bridge but there doesn't seem to be an analogue for projectile-persp-switch-project.
 What this means is that using Projectile I can have a 2-window split in one "project" and 6 in the other, and flipping between them is nice and smooth. Whereas in Project each time I switch the flow is broken, since the default action is to present a menu and maybe open a single file.
 I'd love to hear from people who maybe use Project+<something> and have a similar workflow/experience to what I'm aiming for.
 If it helps, my config is based on vertico+consult+embark.
 As always, thanks in advance for your suggestions/support!

 This is for a panic disorder app I've been wanting to make for some time, I've suffer/ed from them. The apps out there aren't that good and the industry standard is to have the app live behind a high monthly fee paywall which I disagree with.
 I'm going to build my backend in Haskell but rather than using something like React-Native I wondered if I could also do the mobile app in Haskell. Ideally I'd want access to native functions like taking pictures, bionic neural engine etc.
 From researching seems like Obelisk might be the right tool for this, but wanted to know if others had built mobile apps in Haskell and their experience/advice if this is a good root to take?
 Also been looking at Rust (trying to keep things FP 😅) but due to not knowing the language, I'm unsure if it's worth learning! Feels like I've been stuck on making these choices and never get started, so trying to break that today!!

 I haven't really dug into it yet, but is it possible to take an org file.. take a series of 1st level or 2nd level headlines and generate .md (or .org) files based on its content?
 i.e. in somecollection.org
 * item1 # updated sometimes yesterday sometext ** item1 subheading somemore text * item2 something about item2 
 Then take that, and make item1.md, item2.md with the contents of item1.md looking like:
 # item1 Some text ## item1 subheading somemore text 
 and item2.md:
 # item2 something about item2 
 My premise: I want to maintain some collection of data in a single file and publish it into another format for sharing/distribution. With comment blocks ignored and not shared.
 It doesn't have to be exactly like I described, if there's a reliable package that does something like this already.

 On the laptop, the first time I find an .org file in an emacs session, it does not format it as an org (heading colours, size etc. not correct). I can work around by either killing the buffer and finding the file again. Or by M-x org-mode. From then on in a given session, any .org file I find, opens correctly.
 I don't have this on my desktop - just works first time.
 Any ideas or file a bug?

 #def -- -█ -g *.md -g !test/** --no-hidden --no-follow -U --sort path #
 For a long one as --ignore-file-case-insensitive, having shell-like TAB completion definitely makes typing it more bearable, like what https://github.com/szermatt/emacs-bash-completion provides in the screenshot for shell-command prompt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am very excited about the new JS (and WASM) backends for GHC (see https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/zlrk40/javascript_backend_merged_into_ghc_iog_engineering/) and today immediately made a quick test using two little programs from the Computer Language Benchmarksgame.
 The first was the pi digits exercise. And I was very excited that GHC immediately compiled the code without any problems and the program ran for the first 1000 digits in 10.36 sec. Although it is currently completely unfair to compare this with other implementations since the JS back-end is not optimised in any way it is nonetheless not completely uninteresting and the result was 0.081 sec for the hand-written JS code with node. That's a factor of 128 faster.
 The second program had to create a 1024 pixel wide Mandelbrot bitmap and compiled and worked equally well. It took 77 sec compared with 0.74 sec for the node version which is about 104 times faster.
 Although the numbers might seem far away from a decent performance I am still very excited about the seamless experience and intend to explore this further for future work. Congratulations to the dev team!!!
 There is indeed an optimisation flag -O here as well and when activated the code runs about ten times as fast compared to the above. Therefore the difference to hand-written JS code shrinks considerably.

This could potentially leave "dangling links" around. At other times, I want to link to a source file on my hard drive, but rather than using an inline file:/// link, which is prone to breaking, I just drop another zettel link inline (eg see the source file [[202212152155]] on my hard drive).
Naturally, when running across these links, clicking on them in The Archive gives no results, and leads to nowhere. This requires me to then copy the zettel id out, and paste it into a file-system-wide search. Ideally, this would be a smoother process.
I'm interested in any suggestions for making this process smoother.
I notice there's a contextual menu in The Archive, when clicking on these links. Perhaps I could create a system service that would show up here? Perhaps there's some other way to automate a fallback search.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I posted yesterday about some difficulties I have had with virtual environments and Emacs, trying to finally set up Emacs as a Python IDE. I have elpy set up, and have managed to get that working. The only issue left is I have no idea how to wrap my head around pyvenv, which came included. Trying pyvenv-workon prompts me to set WORKON_HOME, which I'm unsure about since I run Windows 10, and when I try to activate venvs I've already made and have stored on my computer it doesn't seem to work. Any advice on how I can use pyvenv effectively and program with Python well in Emacs, or any good documentation sources on what exactly is going on? I've tried reading the manuals, couldn't really make heads or tails of the virtual environments content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(EDIT) Answer for future generations:
 "ln -s emacs-setup .emacs.d" is the command, but make sure .emacs.d doesn't exit when you do it.
 ------
 TL;DR: ln -s emacs-setup .emacs.d creates an .emacs.d dir with a link underneath to emacs-setup, where emacs-setup is the repo name.
 Emacs-setup is my github (on my other box it lives in my emacs.d). So this second machine is the first time I'm dealing with pulling it down. Conventional wisdom is "just sym link .emacs.d to your repo" -- but no snippets I find work to do that. (On WSL2 ubuntu just installed).
 I'd settle for pulling my repo contents straight to .emacs.d (how its setup on my other machine) -- but sym link should be pretty easy.
 I'm hoping it's a dumb mistake and not an issue with wsl2.
 ​
 Thanks for any help or snippets to cut/paste and then I'll give results.

I have previously used the built-in Mu4E message view, but that has been retired now, so I need to learn my way around the GNUS based message view. And there's this one thing that bugs me, look at this screenshot:
 https://i.imgur.com/rOsRApi.png
 I had to blur the recipient list out, but that is what is bugging me: GNUS apparently applies some kind of hard wrap on the recipient list which makes it look jumbled and confusing and take up unnecessary vertical screen space. 
 Is there a way to make it just soft-wrap the recipient list like a single long line so it doesn't introduce random line breaks and indents, and so it uses the screen space more economically?

 Now I want to prove with Structural induction that for all finite trees t :: Tree a holds:
 sumLeaves t = sumNodes t + 1
 I now have:
 sumLeaves t = sumNodes t + 1 I.A.: t = (Tree 0) = (Leaf 0) sumLeaves (Leaf 0) = 1 sumNodes (Leaf 0) + 1 0 + 1 = 1 1 = 1 I.V.: We assume that the statement holds for an arbitrary t. 
 I.S.:
 Now what is the induction step, I really have problems with solving this last step.

Better ui and customization, more information than register method.
 Vim-like mark and jump style.
 Integration with buffers recently used.
 Margin indicator support
  
The emacs version which this package supports is >=26.3 . And only rely on cl-lib. The package is under check in Melpa right now, so maybe you need to install it from github . 
 Since I use it for a quite few time and satisfied with it now. I hope if anybody would find it useful and give some advices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I edit typescript files with eglot active, it resets indent-tabs-mode and inserts tabs. I can toggle indent-tabs-mode to go back to spaces, but I'd like to leave it set the way I like. I'm trying to follow the instructions for eglot-workspace-configuration in the eglot manual, but it's not working.
 I've tried creating a .dir.local.el file to set preferences for "typescript-language-server" (see below), but eglot-show-workspace-configuration shows nil, so I don't think these are being found.
 The kap/eglot-current-server command I've written (see below) confirms that I'm running "(typescript-language-server --stdio)".
 (use-package eglot :hook ((js-ts-mode . eglot-ensure) (tsx-ts-mode . eglot-ensure) (typescript-ts-mode . eglot-ensure)) :custom (eglot-stay-out-of indent-tabs-mode) ;; (This didn't work) :bind (:map eglot-mode-map)) (defun kap/eglot-current-server () (interactive) (message "%s" (process-command (jsonrpc--process (eglot-current-server))))) 
 And .dir.local.el looks like this:
 ((nil . ((eglot-workspace-configuration . (:typescript-language-server (:typescript.format.convertTabsToSpaces nil) (:javascript.format.convertTabsToSpaces nil)))))) 
 The root problem is the insistence of eglot and/or the lsp server on tabs rather than spaces.
 But the bigger issue I'd like is how to get configuration into the lsp server. Has anyone got .dir.local.el configuration to work for the "typescript-language-server"?

 ​
 I am learning algebraic-data-types in Haskell, and I ran into a problem I cannot solve.
 So I want to enter a list of groceries, and as an output I should get the total price.
 ​
 For now, I have the types:
 data Item = A | B | C deriving (Eq, Show) data List = Empty | Add Item List 
 ​
 and I have the groceries list:
 list1 = A `Add` (B `Add` Empty) 
 ​
 I have a function (That sets the prices of the items):
 p:: Item -> Int p A = 2 p B = 4 p C = 5 
 ​
 And now here is where I have a difficulty.
 I want to apply the function "p" to my list1. But I am not sure how.
 ​
 Here is my current code:
 price:: (Item -> Int) -> List a -> Int price p (Add x xs) | x == A = A + price xs | x == B = B + price xs | x == C = C + price xs | otherwise = 0 
 I also tried this.
 price:: (Item -> Int) -> List a -> Int price p (Add x xs) = x + price xs 
 Thanks in advance!

 Error (use-package): Cannot load helm-config
 And in the top of the *Messages* buffer I see:
 Error loading autoloads: (void-function helm-make-source)
 I see in the helm GitHub repo history that helm-config has been removed (like 3 days ago). What is the correct way to install and configure helm now, using use-package? Below is my config for helm:
 (use-package helm :ensure t :bind (("M-x" . helm-M-x) ("C-x C-f" . helm-find-files) ("C-x C-b" . helm-buffers-list) ("M-s o" . helm-occur) ("M-s i" . helm-imenu) ("M-s I" . helm-imenu-in-all-buffers) ("M-s m" . helm-mini) ("M-s b" . helm-bookmarks)) :config (use-package helm-config) (setq helm-split-window-inside-p t) (setq helm-use-frame-when-more-than-two-windows nil) (setq imenu-max-item-length 120) (setq helm-buffer-max-length nil) (helm-mode 1) (helm-autoresize-mode 1)) 
 If I remove the (use-package helm-config) part the warning disappears but the error in the *Messages* buffer remains, all seems to work though.
 In the commit removing helm-config it is replaced with helm-autoloads. Should I replace helm-config with helm-autoloads in my use-package statement? I tried, and it seems to work equally bad or well with the error still in the top of the *Messages* buffer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is not exactly about Zettelkasten and knowledge work. But since music is part of the work environment, this might be interesting to you. This is a note that I took yesterday (translated by DeepL):

  
Good music is made to give us strength. Old war music, a lot of video game music, some movie music.
Other music is made for us to give it power. Pop music is made to be about itself. It's all about itself. It wants us to focus our attention on it.
Listen to good music!
Music is part of the cultural environment of us humans. It is the most primal form of cultural transmission of meaning. It is (without singing) meaning in its purest form: Harmony through form in form in form.


I have no study to provide evidence for my thesis. However, my n=1 is very positive. I, personally, like to listen to traditional war music. Now, that I started my cold adaptation (cold shower + shiver walks aftwards (walking in cold with few clothes on)) I feel like nordic war music is appropriate.
But gaming music is my personal favorite. For people, that don't like to listen to music at all: Ambience sounds like campfire sounds, thunder and rain etc. are also power giving.
I like this more than binaural sounds. And my old Celtic/Germanic/Rus genes seem to like it, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a big fan of alpahapapa's org-super-agenda for my GTD dashboard (tho need to update it for org-ql). However, I have this weird thing that happens with my config that I've been unable to figure out: 
 It will only ever trigger once - switching to any query or custom view and then trying to get the org-super-agenda view back gives me the default org-agenda view. I actually have to exit emacs and relaunch in order to get the org-super-agenda view back. This has recently become more problematic since I'm using org-agenda-custom-commands for a Resonance Cal, Blog Queue, and Experiments list.
 Can anyone think of a reason that would occur or what I may have done wrong in my config below? 
 elisp (use-package org-super-agenda :straight t :after org :defer t :config (let ((org-agenda-custom-commands '(("u" "Super view" ((agenda "" ( (org-agenda-span 1) (org-super-agenda-groups '( (:name "Today" :tag ("bday" "ann" "hols" "cal" "today") :time-grid t :todo ("WIP") :deadline today :scheduled today) (:name "Overdue" :deadline past) (:name "Reschedule" :scheduled past) (:name "Perso" :tag "perso") (:name "Due Soon" :deadline future :scheduled future ) )))) (tags (concat "w" (format-time-string "%V")) ((org-agenda-overriding-header (concat "--\nToDos Week " (format-time-string "%V"))) (org-super-agenda-groups '((:discard (:deadline t)) (:discard (:scheduled t)) (:discard (:todo ("DONE"))) (:name "Ticklers" :tag "someday") (:name "Perso" :and (:tag "perso" :not (:tag "someday"))) (:name "UH" :and (:tag "uh" :not (:tag "someday"))) ;; (:name "Neo" ;; :and (:tag "neo" :not (:tag "someday"))) (:name "Ping" :tag "crm") )))) ))))) (org-agenda nil "u")) ) 
 If you're interested in how this helps me GTD and keep in touch with folks an old post (which desperately needs revistsing and re-writing now I use org-roam and have dropped some of the libraries mentioned) is here:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys! I want to use different input methods for different evil modes in emacs. To be more specific, I use colemak for English input (and basically everything else inside emacs), but qwerty for Chinese input. 
 As I've been exploring, I found several possible ways of implementing this: letting fcitx handle the input methods and interface with it using `fcitx.el`, or let emacs handle everything and use `pyim` for Chinese input. 
 I feel like both methods are bad. For fcitx, I'm not sure if the package could change fcitx state as buffers, major/minor modes change. Even it is possible, I suspect that it will be a huge hacking work (I'm a noob with elisp). For the native input methods, I'm not sure how to make the system input methods ignore emacs. Also, letting emacs handle its own inputs seems... inelegant.
 Do you have any good solutions for inputting Chinese in emacs, with colemak as the default English input? Any help would be appreciated!

to build projects. Reading documentation and playing around with codelab
exercises is a great way to get started, but when learning a new

make further progress. To this end I decided to migrate an old hobby project of
mine to use Bazel. This post describes my experience and I hope serves as a
useful example for others.
Bazel is a fantastic build system which by itself provides many
benefits. However dependency management could be
considered an area of weakness for it. This is understandable given its
monorepo origins at Google but when not working in a monorepo, what
is the best way to provide the dependencies a project needs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've been developing a package for my own use to give suggestions while typing. While there are packages that do this, I couldn't find any that were aimed at my use case exactly.
 That is, to suggest something useful while typing based on the current context.
 At the moment I have this setup so there are multiple back-ends which can be enabled at once based on the current context, this way I can have different suggestions based on what I'm working on so:
  
When typing in code, suggest using code completion or dabbrev.
 When typing in comments, suggest using statistical word prediction, falling back to dabbrev.
  
I've been interested in how good word prediction can be, at the moment I'm using N-gram's generated by code-comments of the project I'm working on as input as well as every commit message, the user-manual and some NLTK texts as well. So far it's quite nice but doesn't feel like a game-changer and might need some tweaking to improve it's behavior.
 While I'm aware other auto-completion frameworks might support this functionality, I find it useful to separate blocking completion from this kind of suggestion generation.
 Is anyone doing something similar in Emacs already, any comments?
  
This is the repository if anyone is interested although this isn't yet documented and internals may change.

This prevents laziness as you need pattern match on this to use it and doing so will force evaluation on whether or not the parse resulted in an error.
 Are there any parser combinators that are lazy instead, letting you use partial parses and using imprecise exceptions for parser errors?
 Here's some (old) code where I play around with this:

 Im currently using brave, which automatically blocks all ads and trackers, and (or so they claim) does not fingerprint or record your online activity.

 Or would it be possible to run the Brave browser in Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The great goodness of Emacs has tainted how I feel about my shell. I use Vertico+Marginalia+Consult+Orderless, and life feels awesome inside of Emacs. I go back to my pretty vanilla zsh shell and feel that it's a little… lacking.
 I understand zsh's completion system is quite configurable. I'd love it if I could make completion inside of zsh feel more like how it behaves in Emacs. In particular:
  
When I hit tab to complete something, I want to be able to hit the down key to start cycling through the candidates.
 When I find the candidate I want, tab should fill it in instead of moving to the next candidate.
 If I'm completing a path, after hitting tab whilst completing a directory, I should immediately see the contents of that directory, which I can then pick the file I want and hit tab again.
 Fuzzy completion ala Orderless would be awesome: hitting space during completion acts as a pattern separator.
  
Does anyone have enough zsh-fu to know how to get something like what I described in the shell? I would prefer to do everything with configuration (i.e. no packages) but that's secondary to getting the behavior that I want.
 Thanks in advance. :)

 it's a while i'm trying to make the native version of emacs in windows (not the cygwin one) run term or ansi-term but i always get the "spawning child process: invalid argument". i know that using the cygwin version solve this problem but it has other disadvantages.
 Do you know any solution or a workaround to this issue?

 During Haskell eXchange Novice Track I did a talk about Semigroup, Monoid, Foldable and Traversable. This talk is for beginners that are familiar with basic Haskell syntax. Enjoy :)
 —
 "In this session you will learn about three heroes: Monoid (and its side-kick Semigroup), Foldable and Traversable. Three amazing type-classes, each providing a set of astonishing powers, making your daily programming routines easy as pie.
 During the talk we will encounter numerous villains (a.k.a programming riddles). Though the baddies look tough at the first glance, we will quickly learn that with the help of our protagonists, defeating those villains is a child's play. Are you ready to meet our heroes and master their powers?
 The talk is appropriate for Haskell beginners. We assume familiarity with basic Haskell syntax (functions, data types, typeclasses)."

 Over the last month or so, I've started publishing them to Maven Central to make them more accessible to others, especially now scala-cli supports Scala.js very well. 
 0.3-M4 is on Maven Central now.
 Veautiful is a Scala.js front end I wrote originally in 2017 and have used for writing interactive learning materials since then. 
 Doctacular is a simple set of classes (e.g. router and handling for basic content types, site layout, and table of contents) that make it easy for me to write interactive learning materials. Doctactular is ironically under-documented, but these are some of the sites built with it (albeit several of these are still running on the previous version):
  
Thinking about Programming, a CS0-style resource with programmable games (turtle, lava maze, rescue line, microrat, lunar lander)
 Circuits Up, mostly interactive visualisations of simple circuitry and digital logic
 The Adventures of Will Scala, my Scala course
 Supercollaborative, essentially, second year undergrad software engineering
 My ASCILITE 2022 talk on lightweight course mapping 
  
0.3-M5 will follow soon. (As will another of these posts announcing it.) 0.3-M5 will focus on improving the docs for Doctacular.

 LSP mode is fine otherwise in plain typescript files.

 You can read more about virtual formatting on the site of XMLQuire.
 Virtual formatting isn't that the editor parses the code and formats it by inserting whitespace; the text is not modified, it's just laid out on the screen to reflect its structure.
 How could that be achieved in Emacs? I didn't find any editor capable of that for multiple languages, and Emacs has surprised me multiple times with what is possible in it, so I have hope that it is possible in Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently joined a company that publishes a library compatible for Scala 2.12. I've been trying to find guidance about Scala 2.12 and 2.13 for library maintainers. I found this for Scala 3: https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2022/08/17/long-term-compatibility-plans.html and it's very helpful. Is there anything similar for 2.12/2.13? 
 A few things I'm trying to understand:
  
It seems 2.12 and 2.13 are being supported concurrently. What is the reason for this? Is there any public guidance for how long 2.12 or 2.13 will be supported? 
 Generally speaking, can a Scala 2.12 project be compiled to Scala 2.13?
 Given the latest release is now 3.2, is support for 2.13 worthwhile? (Subjective I know but curious what the community's sentiment is regarding 2.13).
  
Any additional thoughts that might be helpful for someone in my position and new to the Scala ecosystem would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question:
 I want to separate my code logic from Scala Future. After searching and reading some articles, I'm not sure what's recommendation to achieve this?
 Background:
 I have a project where it heavily depends on Future for operations. I have no problem with that. However, when writing the code, I want to be able to, for instance, test my logic instead of testing against Future. Also I know there exist libraries like ZIO, cats-effects, Monix, and Fs2. I may use it in the future. Before that happens, I don't want to choose one or the others too early. Then I found some articles talking about tagless final; but there are also some caveats regarding to applying tagless final such as complexity.
 ​
 Any advice that I can apply for decoupling my code's business logic from Future in a simpler way? Would simply provide a thunk (method or function) do the trick? For example, `Future { myFunc() }` - but with this it looks like the next step or function that handles this still couples with Future object. I appreciate any advice. Many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm new in FS2, and looks like I need some help by getting some entry points or tips on how to implement it by using FS2 next system with the next sub-systems:
 subsystem A: (many instances) just some constant network consumer (one to each peer) with some logic, the result shall be put into some shared storage; also, that subsystem shall send information about of "quality" of consumed data to subsystem C.
 subsystem B: (one instance), consume data from subsystems A send consumed and transformed data to some external subsystem, send information about of "quality" of consumed data to subsystem C
 subsystem C: (one instance) open/close network connection, based on data "quality" information received from A/B.
 ​
 I easily understand how to implement a such system by using Akka actors/messages (every subsystem is just an actor with appropriate messages). But How it could be implemented on FS2? Making every subsystem as a stream is fitting very well, but I'm stuck on how to make such interactions and communications between subsystems. Of course, I could "emulate" actors (for example https://www.signifytechnology.com/blog/2019/10/replacing-akka-actors-with-cats-effect-and-fs2-by-viktor-lovgren ). Or somehow use reactive streams for it. But maybe I just missing something and there is exist a convenient way to do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a config (literate via org-babel) that I'm pretty happy with. I did a very manual setup on my work pc which uses windows (i'm not a dev yet so stuck with windows at my current marketing job). 
 The problem is as I make new strides on my home config I cannot easily mirror the setup at work. On top of that I am also working on going all-in on org mode across my devices. I can figure out the org file syncing with syncthing no problem but as I develop my org setup I don't want to be having disparate versions of my config. 
 Are there any guides or walkthroughs on this type of thing? I know I"ll probably need to figure several things out based on my specific setup but figure there might be something out there like resolving moving between the ~/ and C:/ locations and any other issues I might not realize I'd run into.

 The context is that most editors (including Emacs and vim) have issues when used on non-US keyboards, because stuff is in different places. Many people solve this problem by switching to a US keyboard (which has some other advantages), but I don't really like this solution.
 I can see some challenges for this, like the differences between 104 and 105 key layouts, etc. And this is more from a theoretical standpoint....

In my understanding, it’s an OOP variation of the functional “Functional Core, Imperative Shell” approach. As most examples for Clean Architecture are written in C#, my module structure also looks more like a typical C# than Haskell one to me.
 Could you please help me in haskellizing my project? I found mainly resources about how to structure Haskell libraries not applications. Of course, I’m also thankful for other tips. This is my first serious Haskell project and I love working on it and improving it :)

 I would like to share a subset of my org notes to co-workers by exporting them in html files that are linked together, with one entrypoint which is an org note that I manage to keep up to date with the project state. But I have hundreds of org notes, all in the same directory, so I can't juste use the org-publish :recursive t option.
 What I would like is an option to specify one (or many) org-files to be included and then that the export process follow all links inside the given files (currently org-roam links) and try to included those linked files too.
 Is something like this already exist ? (I've search but not found anything relevant to my need) And if not, what should be my firsts steps to make it work as I wish (I'm fairly new to org publish process).
 Thanks !

 If you do C-u ; then you get a normal semicolon.
 
 I was doing the same thing with JS where if I type the semicolon twice, it will insert a semicolon but if I type a letter it will automatically uppercase it for camelCase.
 (defun easy-camelcase (arg) (interactive "c") ;; arg is between a-z (cond ((and (>= arg 97) (<= arg 122)) (insert (capitalize (char-to-string arg)))) ;; If it's a new line ((= arg 13) (newline-and-indent)) ((= arg 59) (insert ";")) ;; We probably meant a key command, so lets execute that (t (call-interactively (lookup-key (current-global-map) (char-to-string arg))))))

 ​
 Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/Users/me/.emacs.d/init.el’: : Please save the current buffer to a file 
 And if I do a load-file manually then the same error occurs. But if I load the init.el into a buffer, do nothing else but load-file then it all works. As does eval-buffer and the other manual ways to run it. So load-file init.el nothing, C-x C-f init.el, load-file init.el works. It works both from ~/ and from /Users/... --debug-init does nothing, and my
 (message "entering init.el") 
 at the top doesn't get hit when it fails. This started when somehow my init.el seemed to be gone (no clue how) -- so I did a revert-file in the buffer to get a copy back (per the message, save the buffer). It's as if emacs is stuck in some state of not knowing the init.el file exists -- but that seems like nonsense.
 ​
 Thanks for any help or troubleshooting. The fact that the opening message and debug-init do nothing makes me think the file isn't even getting seen at startup.

 ENH_CONST2 = [12, 999, 13, 14, 15].freeze  Both of these are aligned along a left edge -- which is fine. But another choice that I've implemented just as a proof of concept is having these right aligned such as:  ruby RIGHT_ALIGNED_CONST1 = [ 12, 999, 13, 14, 15 ].freeze

 The following holds for the chains:
 i) Each chain has a beginning (left side) and an end (right side).
 ii) An empty chain is a chain
 iii) The end of a chain ch1 can be connected to the beginning of a chain ch by a chain link 1.
 We have following data types:
 data Link = G | S | P deriving (Eq, Show)
 data Chain = Empty | Join Chain Link Chain
 Task: We want to implement a function list :: Chain -> [Link] to determine the material sequence from left to right.
 The test chain we created is: chain1 = (Join Empty G (Join Empty G (Join Empty P (Empty))))so the function should give [G,G,P] as a result, when the input is list chain1

During the process, I reviewed the overview note for the book that I created in my video series.
I have a couple of things planned to break this long note up. I also faintly recall the urge to refactor parts, i.e. stopping to stick to the chapters, and instead re-group the bullet points below per topic.
I don't expect anyone to read this word-by-word 
Do you share the feeling that this is overwhelmingly long?
Did you read the book and have a different structure?

Introduction
Epstein positions his arguments to refute the a claim of the 10000-hour-rule camp of getting expertise: that more time and deliberate practice is all there is.

  spit-window-below other-window (Change to the new window) ansi-term /bin/bash other-window (Change back to main-buffer) 
 I almost got the first 2 but there is something I'm clearly misunderstanding. I got this script
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda () (kill-buffer "*scratch*") (split-window-below) (other-window) (ansi-term "/bin/bash") (other-window) )) 
 Which splits the window in half and nothing more. I'm guessing there is something I'm missing about the other-window because if I comment these 2 out, my final output is emacs opening with ansi-term at the top and main window at the bottom.
 TLDR: How do I configure emacs to have the main-window at the top and ansi-term "/bin/bash" at the bottom on start-up
 Edit: I'm getting this error in debug: Wrong number of arguments: (1 . 2), 0
 Fixed. Apparently other-window requires an argument.
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda () (kill-buffer "*scratch*") (split-window-below) (other-window 1) ; Go to the new window (ansi-term "/bin/bash") (other-window 0) ; Back to main window ))

 I created a ~/.emacs (there was none before that "(global-set-key (kbd "M-[ f") 'move-end-of-line)
 Ok, that moves me to the end of the line, but it also highlights all the text I moved over.
 whereas M-x move-end-of-line just moves the cursor to the end of the line.
 I am a very emacs noob, so I apologize if I am asking my question improperly. I have looked at several websites to find what I could find but I just can't seem to make it work. 
 I have since removed the ~/.emacs file
 ​
 Here is a new bit of news - I just found out the problem is only under the GUI in a terminal (Qterminal in LXQT) The CLI (non-X) pseudo terminals don't have this issue.
 C-e and C-a actually work but on my other machines and in text-only mode (non-X) on this machine [home] and [end] serve to go to the beginning and end of the line I am on.

 Instead of:
 for { textA <- read(fileA) textB <- read(fileB) _ <- write(fileC, textA + textB) } yield () 
 you can do:
 import zio.direct._ defer { val textA = read(fileA).run val textB = read(fileB).run write(fileC, textA + textB) } 
 I've been giving it a try and have found it's worked better than I expected it to. Metals has no problem inferring the types of any of the channels. (I'm using scala 3)

To allow for better user experience and composability for existing flakes, discoverability of flakes is a necessary feature.
The site search.nixos.org is used to search for packages, options, and flakes. It also provides metadata information such as descriptions, maintainers, and compatible platforms.
Currently, search.nixos.org imports flake metadata through custom nix code that wraps flake evaluations. However, wrapping employs too much memory when used with large repositories such as nixpkgs. This causes a segmentation fault. As currently implemented, search.nixos.org cannot show all flakes.…]]></summary>

 I've been looking around and I can find a lot of documentation on how to get started with emacs. But I still don't understand, what actually is it?
 Vim can be described as a modal terminal text editor.
 But what is emacs?
 As far as I can tell it seems to be much more than just a text editor, right?
 Could you use it as a terminal text editor? Or do I have to use the GUI?
 Apart from editing text what else does it do?
 There seem to be a lot of things you can do with Emacs that you cant do with Vim.
 But is there anything you can do with Vim that you cant do with Emacs?
 For example the modal editing stuff?

 Do you use this type of drivers to access RDBMSes in your scala projects? They seem popular with other java based frameworks, such as Vert.x, Quarkus, but not so much in the scala world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm fairly new to Haskell and am struggling with how to ensure type safety of my domain model. I'm modelling "Weather Station", which currently looks as follows:
 ```haskell data MeasurementType = Rain | Humidity | Pressure | Temperature | WindStrength | WindAngle | GustStrength | GustAngle
 data Measurement = MeasuredRain (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredHumidity (Double) | MeasuredPressure (Pascal) | MeasuredTemperature (Kelvin) | MeasuredWindStrength (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredWindAngle (Degree) | MeasuredGustStrength (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredGustAngle (Degree) 
 data TimeSeries = TimeSeries { measuredProperty:: MeasurementType, values:: Map UTCTime Measurement }
 data Sensor a = Sensor { identifier :: a, supportedMeasurements :: [Core.MeasurementType] }
 -- each sensor supports different measurement types, ideally it should also be type checked type GetMeasurements a = Sensor a -> TimeRange -> NonEmpty MeasurementType -> IO [TimeSeries] ```
 What I would like to achieve is to ensure TimeSeries measuredProperty match Measurement type. That is, it shouldn't compile when one tries to create time serie of type Rain while putting e.g. MeasuredWindAngle inside.
 The measuredProperty is needed to group time series and e.g. compute an average from each serie type. That is, separate average for Humidity, Rain etc..
 Basically, each weather sensor will return many different measurements, where the measurements can be duplicated among different sensors. Therefore, I'd like to combine all measurements into a single list, group by type and then aggregate.
 Moreover, each sensor has a different set of supported measurements. Ideally, this should be reflected in the type system as well. That is, one shouldn't be able to ask for Pressure where the given sensor only supports [Temperature, Humidity].
 Anyone can give me any clues on how to achieve this?

 I'd say my trajectory of experiencing programming languages was pretty common for a regular CS undergrad. Started off with Java, everything was new, many things felt weird and difficult (because they are), but I accepted them blindly and was happy. Other lectures required me to code in Python, C and C++. The amount of work required for the lectures prevented me from diving deeper into any language than what was required, but they all seemed to be decent with their individual benefits and drawbacks.
 But then came Haskell, it felt like an enlightenment. The mathematical beauty, the expressive type system, the declarative, composable nature …]]></summary>

 Does Emacs have a way of enabling the user of a particular .emacs.d but allow the project or session settings to be separate? Creating doom profiles for each user account does get time consuming.
 I have been able to create some workarounds for such issues, such as this way of setting a separate custom.el file when I run a profile copied to different user accounts on different computers.
 (setq custom-file (format (expand-file-name "%s-%s-cukstom.el" user-emacs-directory) (getenv "USER") (getenv "HOST"))) 
 I have noticed that Emacs has a command-line option --user that allows the usage an .emacs.d belonging to another user which would help avoiding replicating .emacs.d for different user accounts and going through whole doom compilations, but I need something for the particular .emacs.d as well as the project.
 Is there some package that makes such things easier? I already user Chemacs2 to keep the .emacs.d options separate, but this needs to be on a project or directory basis, ie profile + project/working directory

 Macs represent 1/3 of development platforms and deployment targets for Haskellers, but I myself haven't used a Mac in about 15 years. I would like to know what it's like to work with Haskell on a Mac.
 I'd like to ask about one aspect of the experience in particular: getting set up. And the specific reason I'm asking about this is that notarizing GHC for Macs is currently on the to-do list.
 Notarization is part of Apple's fight against malware. Codesigning is another. I am still learning how they work and what the consequences are.
 Does the lack of a notarized installable affect you? (Example of missing notarization here.) If so, how? It helps to be specific: Did you get started with GHCUp? Stack? Something else?
 What other pain points exist when you (or your students/classmates/colleagues/bosses) get set up to work with Haskell? What's the biggest pain point?
 I'll have access to a Mac soon, but I don't want to base my effort on one data point. :)
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched my config over to the (very!) aesthetically pleasing and nicely usable emacs nano. Already using it as a daily driver and very happy with it UX-wise, though I still have a thing (and a reported bug) keeping it from being near-ideal.
 Math-preview (using the new one with MathJax3), which I rely on heavily on latex when taking notes for astrophysics formulas and, well... math. ¯\(ツ)/¯ Math-preview just gives a blank little box (smaller than formula's expansion) where the formulas should go despite the fact I have it triggered on all pages with formulas via this:
 elisp (use-package math-preview :straight t :custom (math-preview-command "/opt/homebrew/bin/math-preview")) (setq math-preview-scale 1.75) (setq math-preview-tex-marks-inline '(("$$" "$$"))) (setq math-preview-tex-marks '(("\\begin{equation}" "\\end{equation}") ("\\begin{equation*}" "\\end{equation*}") ("$$" "$$") )) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'math-preview-all) 
 modification in custom so that it does not trigger on pages talking about money and only explicitly on a double $$ in case people were wondering. As you can probably tell from the preview command I'm on an M1 OSX system and straight as my package manager. This block works in my other config, so unsure if it's related to the fact nano uses fixed width in the main text (whereas I had variable pitch in my other config... or some other factor. Any insights appreciated.).
 I do notice that nano does some implicit (and nice!) rendering of things like CO_2 and sub and superscripts automatically inline typing, but this problem relates directly to complex math formula rendering. 
 Anyone got it working with nano?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some kind of utility that can present an overlay that displays the parameter names when the mouse hovers over a function invocation, with optional parameter descriptions.
 One feature would be to invoke a function that replaces a function call with an intermediate function that takes the named parameters, presenting a dialog where you enter the parameters.
 The idea is not to replace the function itself but use some kind generic function that can do it for any function.
 eg if a function defined as (defun dofunc a b c) it gets replaced by (param-call 'dofunc :a a-param :b b-param c: c-param) and presents a dialog for it.
 Any such thing in the Emacs universe?

 More? means cmd is expecting some additional command (creating multiline statemens). In cmd typying either ( or ^ result in More?, but I don't know what is causing this error in org-babel. Interestingly, if run like this:
 #+begin_src shell :results output :session shell echo "%cd%" echo "hello" #+end_src 
 I'm getting the right output:
 #+RESULTS: : Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.2251] : (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. : echo "%cd%" : "c:\Users\johndoe\Org" : echo "hello" : "hello" 
 But only when run for the first time, if running for second time, I'm getting this:
 #+RESULTS: : : cd%" : "c:\Users\johndoe\Org" : echo "hello" : "hello"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I have written complete bindings to five different C libraries (freetype2, libvorbis, libspng, al, Chipmunk2D) and the question in the title may very well be the last one I have concerning FFI for quite some time. The question originates from the fact that chiphunk strips prefixes, something no other low-level library I've seen does.
 Reasons for stripping prefixes:
  
The module structure was made for this. If there was a convention to be made for writing C bindings, this is the obvious default. Kudos for defining new Bool/Int/Float types, it's refreshing to remember Prelude is a module like any other one;
 Probably saves a few thousand characters per library, plus makes Haddock easier on the eyes;
  
Reasons to keep prefixes:
  
OpenGLRaw did it first and it still holds the gl prefix, same with gl;
 No need to explicitly qualify imports;
 Names stay at 1:1 to the API reference, if one exists;
  
There obviously is no one true answer to this question, I'm merely looking for the public opinion on this. I may well leave everything as is since the libraries work well enough regardless of the actual function names.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electrical circuits have static topology, there is restricted dynamism through "switch" which i think is transistors. Do electrical circuits have "join" and if so what is it? You'd have to spill water on the circuit or have the ability to rewire itself. But the extent to which it can rewire is pre-determined by whatever was printed on the board.
 What is a higher order function or closure in an electrical circuit? It is a "piece of circuit" that can be joined or not, but the ways in which the join can be activated are constrained, so this is not actually join. Circuits are compiled. Do HOFs compile to "piece of circuit" guarded by switches?
 How would one model a concurrent list comprehension (dynamic cardinality) in a circuit? This should be possible with applicative because the continuation is pre-fabbed and reused, though here we need multiple instances of it. Can a circuit do this or do you need to print the continuation C times to the board, thus constraining the list cardinality by amount of "memory" on the board? Is this the essence of applicative – you do not know how much memory you will need?
 Can we encode dynamism into the frequency domain? A single physical circuit on the board, and multiple input signals multiplexed through the circuit simultaneously?

 The question in the back of my mind is why does a pure inmutable language need garbage collection for (which is an instant disqualify from AAA games an any other real time task I guess and the big selling point of Rust)?
 Variables are scoped to functions and in need of Ref and friends, living inside monads couldn’t they just be destroyed automatically (in a deterministic way) once out of the context?
 I get being lazy has a toll on memory usage, but is that a real limitation nowadays?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I refused to install VS Code in this laptop and default to Emacs for everything. I used vanilla Emacs without many issues for a while, but decided to use Prelude yesterday.
 Oh, it's so nice, but at the same time... I know I can disable guru-mode, plus customize the few things that irk me... but maybe there's a better starter kit?
 My objectives are:
  
No modal editing: I know vim basics, but I don't want a modal editor.
 I work most frequently with Python, Java, and Rust. Prolog, Puppet, Ansible I also do frequently. Wide language support would be nice. I'm a believer of LSP, so I'd like to use LSP.
 I write a lot of AsciiDoc for work. Being able to integrate aspell and Vale would be a big plus (recommended plugin for Vale is https://github.com/tpeacock19/flymake-vale , which is not in MELPA- maybe a straight.el-using starter kit would be helpful? Or perhaps I should just submodule/subtree/subrepo it?)
 Reasonably similar to vanilla Emacs- I don't want to be too lost without my configuration.
 Multi-account email client? I already mbsync two personal accounts (GMail and Yahoo) for backup purposes, might consider handling work email in Emacs too.
 I work significantly on RHEL 8 systems, which ship Emacs 26.1, and also on a RHEL 9 box (27.1).
  
Thoughts, suggestions?

 They had in common to use org.portablescala.reflect.annotation.EnableReflectiveInstantiation to discover Test classes (I think that is my missing point). 
 But this does not work with Scala 3. Does anyone know a Test Framework that uses Scala 3, or better has some instructions on how to implement the sbt interface? 
 Here is my dummy implementation so far. When adding the testFramework to sbt it seems to be picked, but nothing really happens (see printlns - PRINTED vs. NOT PRINTED ): 
 final class SimulationTestFramework extends Framework: val name: String = "CSimulation" val fingerprints: Array[Fingerprint] = Array(SimulationFingerprint) println(s"SimulationTestFramework started") // PRINTED def runner( args: Array[String], remoteArgs: Array[String], testClassLoader: ClassLoader ): SimulationRunner = println("TestRunner started") // NOT PRINTED new SimulationRunner(args, remoteArgs, testClassLoader) end SimulationTestFramework object SimulationFingerprint extends SubclassFingerprint: def superclassName(): String = "camundala.simulation.custom.CustomSimulation" final def isModule() = true final def requireNoArgConstructor() = false println(s"Simulation Fingerprint for ${superclassName()}") // PRINTED final class SimulationRunner( val args: Array[String], val remoteArgs: Array[String], testClassLoader: ClassLoader ) extends Runner: override def tasks(taskDefs: Array[TaskDef]): Array[sbt.testing.Task] = { println("TASKS") // NOT PRINTED Array() } override def done(): String = println("it is done") // NOT PRINTED "ok down" end SimulationRunner

However, this doesnt show what the error is. 
 I'm asking because there's like 20 different flymake options in the customization panel.

 There are reveal.js, impress.js and others, but I think Spectacle is the most powerful.
 With this ox-spectacle.el, a spectacle.js backend for org export engine, you can make beautiful and powerful slideshow easily. To me, it's one of the best solutions to create slideshows.

Recently I took a course in programming paradigms and was introduced to Haskell and functional programming. I found it very fun and interesting, so I am planning on taking more classes in functional programming in the future. But, other than in research and academia, where is it used? I never see any job postings looking for someone knowing Haskell/functional programming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started using emacs again after 10 years :-). I'm using the basic GNU Emacs distribution for Windows 64. Without having to use a hot-rodded version, I was looking for some info on a few basic customization tips that almost anyone new to emacs would want to do. For example, I figured out how to change fonts, window size and basic foreground/background colors and put those commands into my "init.el" file, so now it looks better (and is more usable for me).
 It would be nice to figure out how to make Emacs use the mouse for basic cut and paste from the clipboard. also, if you are in the command line, it would be great if the up-arrow key would give you command history (is that possible ?). Is there a list somewhere of the top "5" things a new emacs user would want to do to make Emacs more useful/friendly out of the box ? ... and how to do it ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The larger my zettelkasten becomes, the more the built-in search of The Archive does not give a good overview of the search results  in any cases. Especially when I search for keywords which occur in a lot of zettels or that are very short (like e.g. "git") it takes me a while to find the right zettel. Well, compared to Niklas Luhmann it's still ligheting fast, but thats another story. ;-)
Searching is something I do a lot while working with my Zettelkasten. As I said before, title search is the feature I miss the most in The Archive.
On the other hand, I asked myself: would a combined search of title and content not even be better?
To check that out, I made a little Python script that I just pusblished on GitHub (for the first time, by the way – quite exiting!). This is the link:
https://github.com/ralfzosel/zk-smart-search
The installation chapter is quite short – probably too short, if you never used Python before. So if you want to check out my script  (which would make me very happy) and if you have any trouble make it run, I am happy to assist.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using LSP from within Doom Emacs with evil enabled. 
  
Code actions: When there is only one available code action, lsp-execute-code-action automatically executes the action without asking me to confirm first, this is problematic since often I just want to see what code actions are available on a line, without necessarily executing them. What is the workaround for this?
 
The intellisense messages on the right side of the screen are often truncated due to a lack of space on my screen. How can I view the entire message when this is the case? Surely there's a better way than just flycheck-list-errors since I have to actually visually search where in the list the error/warning corresponding to my current line is. Add further to this fact the ID columns on that interface is often truncated

 (And tangentially related: why does flycheck-list-errors provide a different error list than consult-lsp-diagnostics? I have an example of this which I can produce upon demand.)
 ​
  
When LSP shows some information about what I'm typing in the minibuffer, how can I choose to view that information in full? See the image below. You can even see the "1/3" page label. How do I access those pages? If I press ESC so I can press K, pressing ESC gets rid of the message in the minibuffer and then attempting to press K will simply yield LSP :: No content at point.

next-error / flycheck-next-error does not let you navigate to warnings (despite warnings appearing in the flycheck 'error' list). Is there a command that also lets me navigate to the next/previous warning?
  
​
  
Are there any other LSP usage tips I should know about?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on integrating nano into my current setup (which is going nicely). Really like the aesthetic (though it still needs some tweaking). Good use of an hour!
 One really weird thing I encountered which I can't figure out - I'm using nano-modeline (not sure if tthat's relevant - I am *not* using nano-bindings), but whenever I pull up the date picker to insert a date, in my old system, I would abuse S-RightArrow or S-DownArrow to move quickly through the calendars and Return to pick the date. 
 However when I try this with nano's setup, while I get the calendar pop up, a shift Right, Down or Left gets me a [No window right from the selected window] etc type message like it's trying to move to another window or buffer rather than move along the datepicker calendar. Strangely, other keys like M-S-Arrow etc seem to work fine.
 Does anyone know what I've done here or have an idea of what I need to do to restore the default date picking behaviour? (my muscle memory and sanity depend on it).

After following the install instructions form https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/ I enabled tree-sitter-hl-mode and the syntax highlighting changed from the default major mode one to the one below. However, this does not look consistent at all. I thought that tree-sitter would put a focus on giving e.g. local variables like v below the same color throughout the entire scope. but this does not seem to be the case. Am I missing sth here? because like this I dont see any merit over the ordinary highlighting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I waded back into my init.el to get a nicer aesthetic this week, and have been playing with org-modern. 
 Strangely, when I use the following simple block for it:
 elisp (use-package org-modern :straight t :after org ) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-modern-mode) (add-hook 'org-agenda-finalize-hook #'org-modern-agenda) 
 this causes org-super-agenda (which I heart and abuse regularly) to pitch the following error, which I assume has something to do with org-modern overriding org-agenda or cstom commands somehow. 
 shell Error (use-package): org-super-agenda/:config: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-modern-agenda 
 Any ideas as to what may be going on or how to resolve it? (it is definitely the last hook in the org-modern block that causes the issue as when I comment it out, org-super-agenda triggers normally. 
 thanks! Daryl. PS> Lemme know if you need me to paste up the o-s-a block. Though I feel it's probably not related to it for some reason.

 I'm having trouble with python mode. Specifically, there's a command `python-check` which runs a code checker on the current buffer. You can specify which checker to run and by default it's `pyflakes`.
 Everything works as expected and the code gets checked. However, if I try to use `flake8`, the encoding is all messed up (from what I understand) and I can't seem to figure out how to fix this.
 You can see the code (lsp works as expected and I do get autocomplete, suggestions, documentation, etc with pyright)
 All good here, lsp works as intented
 Now, if I run `pyflakes`, here is what I get:
 ​
 This is also good, pyflakes works as expected
 Now I run `python-check` (C-c C-v keybinding):
 flake8 instead of pyflakes
 And what I get is this:
 flake8 encoding?
 Which actually works, but my guess is encoding is messed up somewhere and I am not sure where exactly.
 As a side note, running `flake8` in vterm works normally:
 vterm
 I also tried `(set-language-environment)` to UTF-8, but that didn't help.
 Has anyone encountered something like this and resolved it?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I am really struggling to get good performances on windows with emacs...
 As far as I understand, windows sub-process and file system is working against emacs way of doing things. Therefore I've read multiple times that switching to WSL makes emacs much more performant. Also using a VM with Unix might help.
 I've tried that and basically have seen 0 improvement, especially with LSP and maggit. I've built emacs from source to be sure that native comp, etc, is enabled.
 Using only the Linux file system (not using /c/...) made emacs a little better but still far from my Linux experience with it :( my config works really well on Linux, so I don't think it is problematic?
 I am using emacs for very different purposes such as: unity c#, c++ dev (sometimes with VS), .Net, org mode, org roam, trump edit, etc... Which makes it hard to live only in the wsl Linux file system as far as I've been able to test (a pain with unity, a pain with VS, a pain with / and \, a pain with crlf and lf, etc...)
 Does anyone have a good way to have a performant emacs on windows please? Does the native window switch on v29 improves anything?
 Emacs is such a good piece of software, it makes me really sad that after battling for months to try to solve the problem, I find myself on the verge to switch editor again because I cannot ditch windows...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I cross-reference with RefTeX using reftex-reference (C-c )). It's very convenient as it opens a list of available macros, followed by a type of references, followed by a list of labels to insert. On the other hand, cleveref extends cross-referencing, which add very useful macros and does other things as well.
 Currently, my routine is to press C-c ), insert a standard \ref{}, and then change it to \cref{}.
 I tried to find solutions, which implement Cleveref in RefTeX but there is not many sources; the one I found here on TeX does not seem to work; It does not add anything new to the list.
 I found somewhere else this line: (setq reftex-refstyle "\\cref"). This is OK. RefTeX no longer asks for a macro but go straight to a list of types followed by a list of labels. Then it inserts \cref{...} with a proper string.
 This works but ideally though I would have a proper list of macros available from Cleveref: \cref{}, \Cref{}, \namecref{}, \pagecref{} etc. on top of regular macros.
 Does anyone have or know about a working solution?

So, suddenly my emacs 29 stopped showing backlinks in org-roam. I've downgraded to emacs 28 and this seems to solve the problem but was just curious as to if there are nay fixes for this (tho weirdly, 28 seems just as smooth as 29 - note I am using homebrew to install emacs 29.0.60). 
 I *believe* this is what caused it googling around and troubleshooting but was curious as to whether anyone had had the same experience and if there was clarity on the path to supporting 29 (cause I often find it's hard to tell when it's safe to upgrade or do a straight-pull =] ).

Keywords
The keywords should be instructive for the type of task. I have started to distinguish whether an audio-visual input is an interview or a lecture. It is completely irrelevant to me at the action level. I sit down at my computer in both cases and take notes as I watch and listen.
For me personally, it doesn't even make a difference whether I'm listening to a podcast or watching a video. I do both on my computer, because I only listen to both at home with access to my computer. I don't listen to anything on the side while on the road.
Rather, I differentiate by length when assigning keywords: short (<20min) or long (>20min) audio-visual inputs, because I build both differently into my workday.
This is how my current note about Things looks like. Do you have any template or regular practices when you make notes about software?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm new to emacs and I built v28.2 on my Pop! OS Linux instance. I'm trying to get my init file to work to set the initial window (frame) size.
 I've created an init.el file in my .emacs.d folder in home (i.e., ~/.emacs.d/init.el), but it doesn't seem to be executed.
 When I start emacs, it looks like this:
 Figure 1. Initial Emacs Window (roughly 900x900)
 What I want is for it to look like this:
 Figure 2. Resized Emacs Window (roughly 2500x1100)
 But it always starts out as Figure 1 and the only way to get it to Figure 2 is if I open my init.el (right-click in Nautilus and select emacs).
 And here is a third view showing my .emacs.d (shown by C-x C-f of ~/.emacs.d), the contents of the init.el file and the value of my user-emacs-directory (which is ~/.emacs.d/):
 Figure 3. .emacs.d folder, init.el file, and user-emacs-directory variable value.
 I've also tried renaming the init.el file as .emacs and putting it my home folder with the same result.
 What am I missing here?
 EDIT: responses based on replies:
  
user-init-file shows "~/.emacs", which, as noted above, I tried along with .emacs.d/init.el without success
 When normally opening emacs, my/set-initial-frame is not defined. If I open the .emacs file from Nautilus, it opens the frame correctly and my/set-initial-frame is defined. If I rename the .emacs file to "foo" and open that from Nautilus, it doesn't set the frame and my/set-initial-frame is not defined.
 No errors in *Messages* buffer
 There is no emacs folder in .config
 initial-frame-alist is always 'nil' (when it works and when it doesn't)
 Not sure if I'm running emacs server, but server-mode variable is 'nil'
  
Note the original .emacs content I found here.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My new note-taking/zettelkasting mantra is: Create, review, and edit with abandon. Trust that something surprising or magical will happen.

  
I realized that in a few months, let alone years, at this rate most of my time would be spent on the maintenance of memories [notes]. I, as others have found, would be too busy maintaining these memories to use them. 1


What does "use" mean? I can use a note's contents to reignite ideas in me. They can spark new, novel ideas and connections with established knowledge. Some balance between creation, review, and maintenance has to be made in zettelkasting. In that sense, zettelkasting is like dog training. Dog training is hard work, and it is often not fun to train, but the rewards of a well-trained dog show up throughout the day.
Reviewing zettel has been a focus of mine, and I highly recommend it. Looking at notes created yesterday, three weeks ago, six months ago, and last year is a great start. If we develop notes sporadically, we'll probably only have one or two notes to review. Slowly and steadily, we plow through our notes, and in time, we will have reviewed every note multiple times.
I think Minto is confused about how much time it takes to review a couple of notes (if atomic, focus on a single idea) and how a short review over and over builds, reinforces knowledge, and shows not only new connections but whole new ideas.
Is it true that the ideas captured in our notes are not worth reviewing? I suggest the next to capture, the review is the most essential piece in a ZK workflow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Scala 2 we used implicits object pattern:
 import acme.Acme import acme.implicits._ 
 In Scala 3 we are supposed to use import given:
 import acme.{Acme, given} 
 However, import given doesn't truly replace the functionality of the pattern:
  
In Scala 2, "extensions" were coded as implicit class, so they were covered by import acme.implicits._
 
In Scala 3 extension is not given. So import given ignores them.
 
 In consequence, the old "implicits object pattern" must be kept alive, for orphaned extensions:
 import acme.{Acme, given} import acme.extensions._ 
 I believe this deficiency may have been overlooked, because non-orphaned (is there a name for it?) extensions don't need explicit imports (which is a great feature BTW).
 Proposed solutions:
 1. Make import recognize extensions as givens, just for the sake of it:
 import acme.{Acme, given} // imports extensions too import acme._ // does not import extensions 
 2. Add another type of import: import extension
 import acme.{Acme, given, extension}

 Zombie movement and attack
 Zombies move forward a space equal to their speed each turn, if they can. If a zombie cannot move forward because there is a plant in the space it is standing on, the zombie bites the plant and reduces its hit points by 1 and remains on that space. The only exception to this is the Vaulting zombie: if its speed is still 2 , then he jumps over the first plant and moves on, but his speed is reduced to 1.
 Let's define the performZombieActions function, which will perform the aforementioned appropriate action on all zombies in the model. If a zombie reaches the end of the playing field, return Nothing! The function does not have to delete dead plants!

 it's probably because of not setting environmental variable, right?. The wasm code compiles with $ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm. And eglot doesn't know about GOOS=js and GOARCH=wasm yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running GUI Emacs on Arch Linux WSL2 (Vcxsrv X-server). I am noticing a significant slowdown when I full-screen my GUI Emacs. The slowdown is particularly noticeable in input latency. When I type fast, I would have to wait a few seconds for the letters to appear one by one.
 When I shrink down the size of the GUI frame, Emacs becomes very snappy and responsive. I have noticed a positive correlation between Emacs lag and the size of the frame -- this is the weirdest thing I've come across since I started using Emacs years ago. Running no configuration with `emacs -q` is the same thing -- significant latency when the frame is big.
 Has anyone been faced with this issue? I am so bewildered by this but can't find anything related online. At the moment I'm using terminal Emacs as the frame-size vs. latency issue does not exist in the terminal.

 Now as I was looking to `cling`, a c++ interpreter. It is having some funny business too.
 [cling]$ 1 11 (int) 1 [cling]$ 2 22 (int) 2 [cling]$ apple aapappapplappleapple input_line_6:2:2: error: use of undeclared identifier 'apple' apple ^ [cling]$ 
 The repeated strings right under the input prompt aren't suppose to be there, under term and terminal.app it all worked fine (i.e. without the repeated gibberish).
 That makes me wonder if it is possible to start a comint process using term or vterm

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raku programming language hashes name, version, author, and other package metadata and uses the hash as the directory name for a library or a program. Even the names of program resource files are hashed before installing resource files.
 Raku didn't have to hash, but it did because some file systems don't support unicode file names.
 The end result is that it's possible for a raku module repository to host a library written by different authors and for raku programs to import different versions of the same library written by different authors. I think this is almost the most advanced module system.
 I think haskell can do the same by differentiating name, version, and author of a library or a program when installing them onto a system. Then, haskell can install and import multiple versions of a library written by different authors. This can mitigate downsides of dynamic linking.
 If hackage hosted a library written by different authors, then no one has to ask hackage maintainers for taking over an unmaintained library or program.

The catch: These times are not consistent from day to day, as they are related to the length of the day and the time of sunrise and sunset. As such, a simple daily timer doesn't work. Various online services give times for Zmanim, such as this one (New York for an arbitrary example). 
 I'm interested in setting up Emacs to give Zmanim times. I don't know of any package that does this. Is there such a package, and if not, is there a package that can accept timers with offsets or scrape a specific website to provide that information?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember from Dan Grossman's Programming Languages course in SML that if you changed anything, you'd have to restart the REPL to make sure you weren't shadowing or clashing with stuff. So for example I load this into a ghci REPL
 fracEquiv a b c = (a * c) / b 
 and I don't want that version anymore, I want my fancier version
 fracEquiv = \a b c -> ((a * c) / b) 
 So I guess my new fracEquiv overwrites the old one. Problem solved(?) But what if I just called it fracEquiv2 and wanted to make the REPL forget about the original fracEquiv ? So in general, is there a way to dump/see what the REPL has and then go in and excise -- or even change -- what's in the running REPL? Or am I just flying blind and having to remember what's in the REPL, overwrite or restart it? So if Haskell doesn't allow this, do you know of any REPL-based languages that do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 Some time ago, I commented in the Alchemist Resurrection issue, talking about how alchemist.el can be a nice alternative to LSP. 
 BUT, with the news that in the next Emacs version eglot (lsp client) is going to be in the core, I decide to modify alchemist in a different way, enhancing other capabilities and letting eglot do what he best does (which is the functionality of elixir-ls).
 I'm quite relief to know that this lsp server is FROM the community and heavily inspired by the original alchemist-server.
 For now, Apprentice is usable, similar to alchemist.el but with most of the merge requests in place and with some changes:
  
Remove s, f and dash dependencies
 Remove cask as a project manager, using a simple Makefile (I don't have anything against Cask, but I prefer to use my method)
 No alchemist server, this is the main point and all the functionality that was using some of the underlying capabilities are not working (but some of them will be implemented in a different way)
 An optional vterm REPL with IEx
  
My next steps will be to fix some underlying functionality that was quite useful like help and macroexpand. 
 I hope in the future to submit this fork to MELPA (given that alchemist.el is no longer maintained),for now, here is the project:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble finding how to copy and paste notes from some windows files I have in OneNote vs emacs.
 My org-mode files are in UTF-8 and I am mid process of moving a lot of info at work from OneNote into emacs to try to consolidate a few years worth of notes in OneNote, Joplin, Logsec, Obsidian...
 Anyway, when the bullet points are copied into Emacs, I get \225 characters that are the code for the windows bullet point and I can't save the file without errors into UTF-8 like I do with my other files.
 I saved it as Raw text now to try and use M-x find-file-literally and M-x replace-string but when I type in the code as it looks in emacs, I can't replace '\225' with a dash '-' to convert it to a emacs normal list.
 Am I using the find-file-literally wrong? I can manually change all of the text but I've done that a few times and tried a few things now and I don't know what I need to do to replace the \225, \247, type characters that come over from whatever windows type character they are.
 Also, I am on Windows 10, using emacs 28.2 and doom-emacs.
 Attached are screenshots of what it looks like and what buffer output I get trying to convert all this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was investigating why inferior julia is showing no prompt at all. My investigation leads to me submit this issue: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/47837.
 The solution is to set TERM = dumb, however, I have used setenv process-environment to set TERM to dumb, still inside the inferior julia, ENV["TERM"] is vt50.
 Opening a terminal and type TERM=linux julia, this change is reflected inside the process, i.e. ENV["TERM"] is linux. 
 Is this a case of processes started with comint not respecting TERM environmental variable??
 I am confused about this behaviour.

I tried simpleclip.el but when running simpleclip-copy I got the error message Clipboar suppot not available.
 I can use emacs in graphical mode, but really prefer emacs-nox, because I mostly live in Konsole. Plus some keyboard shortcuts do not work in graphical mode like C-c down (C-c M-O B) (command-org-shiftdown) which I haven't investigated the cause of.

 I switch between Linux and MacOS specific configs with several blocks like this:
 (defun my-system-type-is-darwin () "Return non-nil if system is darwin-based (Mac OS X)." (string-equal system-type "darwin") ) (when (my-system-type-is-darwin) (global-set-key (kbd "s-/") 'comment-or-uncomment-region-or-line) ) 
 So I've got the different system types fairly easily distinguished.
 Unfortunately, the font sizes that work OK on the main docked macbook with multiple screens don't work well on the undocked/portable macbook.
 Any advice on a robust way to tell which mac I'm using, with a view to the config working on other screen configurations? I was thinking I could just detect a hard-coded "if 3 screens of these dimensions then do X, if 1 screen of those dimensions do Y" but I'm not sure the best way to do that, or even if that is the best way to do what I want.
 Any other tips for sharing a single init.el between multiple computers?

 OK, I'm dumb. I found the answer myself within 30 minutes.
 The culprit was make-symbol, which creates an uninterned symbol which is distinct from regular symbols that are checked using assq. Now I changed make-symbol to intern in rangho/create-color-matrix-alist and everything works fine!
 Original post
 I wanted to try using let-alist to simplify my colorscheme code. Basically, I have an alist of colors and its hex values, and I have a list of HSL percentage points. I want to create a new "matrix" alist where each colors are lightened by the "lighten list". This is the code:

I am a tech writer/editor/indexer, and found the ZK method online while researching new organizing methods (new to me, not to the world).  I was tired of feeling like Butterbur's mind--"thing wanted always buried." My zettelkasten will be more for my own personal pursuits than for work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When designing a storage solution for large datasets, the most common families of architectures are data warehouses and data lakes.
A data warehouse is a database management system that houses data from multiple data sources.
Data is structured in a predefined schema, and can be easily analyzed.
A data lake stores all structured, semi-structured and unstructured data in an object storage system.
Unlike a data warehouse, it is not necessary to process data in order to add it to a data lake.
While data lakes are often more flexible in terms of writing data when compared with data warehouses, reading data can be more difficult because it has to be validated against a schema.
This is known as “schema-on-read”.
Now consider the following figure, introduced by Databricks:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just went through this, so I thought I'd document it for Google. What I wanted was a) for Emacs to open new files in the same frame where possible, and b) for my init.el to actually work in the new frames.
 1. Put .emacs.d in user folder
 It saves a lot of messing around if your .emacs.d is in C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming, but if you're like me, you actually keep it on Dropbox or something. So I made a symbolic link that points to it on Dropbox:
  
Start an elevated (admin) cmd prompt
 cd C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming
 mklink /D .emacs.d C:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\.emacs.d (for example)
  
2. Make a shortcut to start the Emacs Daemon
  
Make a shortcut to emacs-28.1\bin\emacs.exe
 Add --daemon to the end of the Target (e.g. C:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\emacs-28.1\bin\emacs.exe --daemon)
 I didn't change Start In.
 Put this shortcut into your Startup folder (C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) so that a new server starts with Windows.
 Run this now to start the server.
  
3. Make a shortcut to Emacs ClientW
  
Make a shortcut to emacs-28.1\bin\emacsclientw.exe
 Add -n -t -a "" to the end of the Target (e.g. C:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\emacs-28.1\bin\emacsclientw.exe -n -t -a "")
 I didn't change Start In.
  
The presence of -t lets you run this shortcut to open a new Emacs client frame that starts at *scratch*.
 The absence of -c makes Emacs open files in an existing frame instead of _c_reating a new one. 
 This emacsclientw shortcut is what you point to when you're telling Windows what app to use to open text files etc.
 4. Make some changes to init.el
 ;; Set custom font here or else new frames won't see it (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "Hack-12")) ;; You may want to have dired start in a specific folder (setq default-directory "C:/Dropbox/")

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since it's Advent of Code season, I've been trying my hand at Haskell (again) for solving puzzles, and I'm also using Stack for building them.
 I organize each day's puzzle into standalone executable, say day07_1 for part 1, and day07_2 for part 2. What I notice is that, when I run stack run day07_1 with source changes, Stack installs every binary configured in stack.yaml at that point. 
 Installing executable day03_1 in /path/to/project/.stack-work/install/x86_64-linux-tinfo6/dc2a579bc1e31f17298a361ff9411c0bf46198b8cd4c4cdef19391b674e4f1ff/9.2.5/bin 
 Obviously, as I add more and more binaries, this gets increasingly annoying. I'd prefer that it rebuilds only the binary I asked it to build.
 Does anyone know why Stack does this, and if there's a way to tell it not to do so? I don't see any relevant options in stack run --help.
 As a workaround, I'm commenting out binaries in stack.yaml than the very one I'm working on at a given time, which is not ideal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I have a longstanding issue I haven't found a solution for. Any time I'm editing an org mode file my cursor will automatically "suck back" to the last text on the screen. For example, I type a sentence, finish with a period then hit space twice to start the new sentence. If I don't type something immediately (like less than a second) the cursor is pulled back to the period, removing the space(s).
 Needless to say it's rather annoying behavior. It's 100% consistent and what I gave was just an example, it's happening in any scenario...using spaces or tabs, happening in lists, etc.
 This is Doom Emacs and I'm running this in 28.1 on Void Linux but it was there in 27.x as well.
 Let me know if there any more info I can provide and TIA for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No programming language is perfect. Don't look for perfection in the physical universe.
 But, you can settle with something good, useful, and practical.
 Haskell can be as easy as you want or as difficult as the number of complex type-level features you drag into your program. It has many useful libraries.
 It has useful type-level features that are not difficult to understand.
 It is not perfect, but it has been practical in my life. It is not the best langauge for everything. I use multiple languages for multiple purposes, but when I use haskell, it is good.
 Haskell is in a practical state of existence.

 find [...] -exec grep --color=always -i -nH --null gef\ördert \{\} \;
 Grep returns with no results found. The problem is that the umlaut ö get's prepended with an escaping sequence. If I run the same command on the commandline without the backslash, grep succeeds. Why is Emacs escaping certain characters anyhow, especially utf-8 valid characters?
 Using bash as the shell. file encoding is utf-8, I set LC_ALL in .profile to en_US.utf8, LANG=C, SHEL=/bin/bash. My Windows is German though.

 Is there a way to temporarily open a file without activating any modes to just extract data I need and close it? Something like:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a newcomer here I just wanted to share my point of view for the community and any maintainers. Emacs has already expanded my mind and I'm beginning to grok the power of having a Lisp system at my fingertips. Now I can get through the more research-intensive install (on macOS at least) to find the best build and install flags. And I can get through learning and customizing any historical quirks of software going on 50 years strong..
 But one big obstacle to me, which isn't customizable, is that the cursor is always in view. Even in the GUI there is this trait which makes it feel like a terminal application (which it did start as). It fundamentally changes how one selects and navigates text (select text, scroll back up and select region disappears). In a world where every other GUI app doesn't behave this way, it is a big change. It feels like a constraint. This will force me deeper into keyboard centric navigation which is fine. I just think cursor flexibility should not be overlooked and for younger people who are switching from other editors and have used the mouse their whole lives, I can see it hurting adoption.
 This is probably very hard to implement, going against how it has always worked, but I think that would be good to at least have an option to let cursor scroll off screen. Let me know what you think. Kinda related: does anyone know of a package that makes the select region wrap around words instead of going edge to edge on screen?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've tried googling to see if there is a function within haskell to check a number to see if it a Double. I had no luck there so now I am trying to make my own. Right now, I have (gotten from StackOverflow):
 isDouble :: Double -> Bool isDouble n = if (floor n) == (ceiling n) then False else True 
 Now this works majority of the time, the only issue is when a number has ".0" after. If I were to test 2.0, it returns False, despite actually being a Double. I know this is because both the floor and ceiling are 2. Is there any way around this? Or should I be trying a different approach?

 Can a database use ODBC to access emacs orgmode tables?
 ChatGPT
 Yes, it is possible for a database to use ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) to access tables stored in the Emacs org-mode format. ODBC is a standard application programming interface (API) that provides a way for database management systems to access and manipulate data stored in other database management systems. It allows a database to connect to and query data stored in other databases using SQL, regardless of the underlying database management s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon folks! I'm Tracy, from Ontario, Canada.
I've been slowly familiarizing myself with some of the zettel intros, posts, and concepts, while also trying to be realistic and conscious about the way my brain works and what will be a sustainable habit to introduce into my existing notes system. Currently, my notes span across academia, professional work, personal stuff, grocery lists, conceptual ideas, project sketches/outlines, and even video game progress plans.
These notes are captured in Zotero attachments, paper bullet journals, google docs, iOS Notes App, liquidtext pdf editor, the reminders app... I don't think I'll be able to so cleanly bundle everything into one tool, but I like the idea of taking the things that really engage and interest me and giving them their own space in the archive so I can make cross-disciplinary connections or revelations!
I am afflicted with the "it needs to be perfect" to start with, and something I've been working on is just doing something "poorly" or "haphazardly" to get that attitude out of the way. My first zettel in the archive software was just me testing the archive syntax (which is new to me) and reflecting on how it feels with my style of note-taking.
Anyways, looking forward to learning more about zettelkasten, knowledge practices, my own brain processes, and the challenge of sorting, retaining, releasing, and integrating knowledge in a way that is helpful to my own goals]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not going to start flooding the sub with chatbot posts, but ChatGPT managed to output a functional program (discounting some empty lists) for grouping and sorting text:
  
 write a haskell program to process text into groups and sort based on the first letter of the line
  
Here is a simple Haskell program that processes text into groups and sorts each group based on the first letter of each line:
 import Data.Char import Data.List -- This function takes a string of text and returns a list of groups, where -- each group is a list of lines that start with the same letter. The groups -- are sorted alphabetically based on the first letter of each line. processText :: String -> [[String]] processText text = -- First, we split the text into a list of lines let lines = lines text -- Next, we group the lines by their first letter grouped = groupBy (\x y -> (toLower . head) x == (toLower . head) y) lines -- Finally, we sort the groups alphabetically by their first letter sorted = sortBy (\x y -> (toLower . head . head) x < (toLower . head . head) y) grouped in sorted -- This is an example of how to use the processText function main :: IO () main = do let text = "hello\nworld\napple\nbanana\ncat\ndog" let groups = processText text putStrLn $ show groups 
 The output of this program when run on the example text given in the main function would be:
 [["apple"], ["banana"], ["cat"], ["dog"], ["hello", "world"]] 
  
Needed some minor cleanup to compile: sortBy takes an a -> a -> Ordering, not a a -> a -> Bool, and the lines variable name needed changing to not match the function. Once complete, it compiles and functions more or less as expected. I could spot the head would likely give trouble on empty lists (which it did) and that groupBy could produce some strange groupings, but wild to see the skeleton of a decent sort function produced so easily. Like AI art, this could be pretty useful for brainstorming, if the results aren't outright useful themselves.

 HOWEVER, is there any sort of interop library that would allow one to program IN Common Lisp to extend emacs? I would think such an interop system would allow one to interact with Emacs' buffer functionality in particular. 
 I'm not really sure that such a thing is very practical or would interest many people. But I recently wrote a Python interop library that allows me to use Python libraries from within Common Lisp, and I found it really helped my own understanding of Lisp quite a bit. 
 I'm just wondering if anything like that has been done. So far, my google searches don't reveal much.

 I'm in a buffer in a directory and I want to find all the files matching a pattern at or below the current directory. What is a simple (or perhaps the simplest) way to get that list?
 What I do now is switch to a terminal (outside of emacs) and using zsh I do print -l **/*-ts-*.el (or whatever pattern I'm looking for). It seems very likely that there is a simpler way to do this from within Emacs. I'm open to loading more applications on my laptop if that would help. This need seems to come up with me very often.

 To be honest, the first time I tried it I was disappointed how hard it was do something simple as save a file, copy/paste and whatnot. However, the "steep learning curve" everyone talks about is just a matter of having a nanosecond of patience. Then speed comes later. What I love about the keybindings is it confines all of my work to the keyboard and the bindings are ergonomic if you also use the right Ctrl and shift keys. My workflow is honestly magnitudes better, being able to jump at lightning speed, completely neglecting arrow keys and the mouse. Also, for the first time ever, I am using all ten fingers to type. 
 The question: I've set up a theme which I like, auto pairing brackets, indent and auto-complete. Curious if there's a way to get linting support? i.e. underlining missing semicolons, typos. 
 Also, can I integrate a terminal into emacs as well? So far having the screen split with emacs and terminal (GNOME on Ubuntu) is working fine, but wondering if there's an even better way. 
 Thanks.

 This code generates a Tribonacci sequence but this is super slow 
 How to do something similar using a State Monad that will take less time?

 Like this example:
 example1 :: [Int] -> Maybe Int example1 = reverse >>> findIndex (== 5) >>> fmap (* 2) 
 When working with functors, I often have >>> fmap . Is there an operator which combines the two?
 But for monads, I can't even do that:
 example2 :: [Int] -> Maybe Int example2 = reverse >>> findIndex (== 5) >>> possiblyFailing where possiblyFailing x = x >>= Just . (* 2) 
 I'm pretty sure that there are idiomatic ways to both of the cases, but I'm just not able to find them 😅

 I've been searching for some time to see if this is even possible in Org mode. It's so simple and hard to describe in searching that I've come up with nothing and it remains something that is keeping me from going all in on Org.
 Is there no way to promote a field of text in Org without a heading marker?
  
In the attached screenshot, I want the text with the arrow ("Promote this text...") to be promoted out of this double Subtree block to reside at the same level of text as if it were under History.
 "text here" should remain under Subtree.
  
Can this not be done or am I missing something simple?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it possible to refer to, or link to, a header in another org file? I'm thinking I may have to read up on org-agenda. 
 I keep a personal journal, and at this point, it's almost a thousand small markdown files no larger than 4k - one for (almost) each day. I refer to each one just simply by linking to the <date>.md and then make my journal entry there. 
 On the upside, I can check what I did this day a year, two year, etc ago by doing "ls *-12-06.md".. but on the other hand, it's really inefficient. 
 I was wondering if it would be more efficient to make an org file for each year and then have header lines for each day, plus additional ones for each topic underneath. I'd like to be able to link from another org file (say a project, or a movie review) and put a date on there and be able to pull up what I was doing that day.
 Any strategies for doing that in org/emacs?

So far I managed to do the first 4 challenges simply by putting them in different directories and using ghci or runhaskell to execute them. As the point of this is learning the language, I don't want to use any libraries not included in base, I'm implementing functions like split or chunks by myself, but including the implementations of these functions in every single challenge solution doesn't seem like a good idea. I'm not sure if Cabal would be a good idea because the project would consist of 25 separate solutions and 25 input files and I'm not sure how would that go. What is the best way to handle this kind of situation?

In the second case, fib' is redefined for every argument x. The compiler cannot know whether you intended this -- while it increases time complexity it may reduce space complexity. Thus it will not float the definition out from under the binding of x.
 In contrast, in the first function, fib' can be moved to the top level by the compiler. The where clause hid this structure and made the application to x look like a plain eta expansion, which it is not. 
  
I cannot really understand how the compiler optimized the first definition of the function and not the second, apparently the redefinition of the function has an impact on time complexity.
 I know that a big part of FP optimization comes to know how to dance with the compiler, it's patterns and to lay stuff out for it to make "better". But unlike tail recursion, this trick doesn't seem as clear to me.
 I'd be most grateful for a clarification on how this works for a beginner haskeller, thanks :-).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have just moved to a macbook and I am already enjoying emacs even more than under WSL. But unfortunately, now the tab key sometimes stops working for emacs GUI. It is not even registered as a keypress: 'C-h c <tab>' just ignores the <tab> keypress. C-i is recognized as a tab press, and in the terminal things seem to work normally.
 I am on Monterey 12.5, emacsplus@28, using a doom config. I tried to find help online but so far was unsuccessful. I have disabled mission control key bindings, including the use of tab to shift focus, but it still seems to happen. Did somebody solve a similar problem? Does it have to do with the shell from which the emacs GUI is started? It might also be something basic about macOs, with which I am completely inexperienced. Thank you for any ideas how to find out what is happening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was watching this video from Cal Newport's podcast where he briefly mentions Zettelkasten. The video is about how he uses a simple marking system while reading and how it makes note taking unnecessary for a professional writer. His definition of the Zettelkasten method is something like take notes on everything you read, regardless if it is relevant to your current project. As an example he gives Ryan Holiday. We know that is a poor definition of a Zettelkasten and Ryan is not a good example either. He takes copious notes, but there is no linking in his system. While I don't agree with his characterization of the Zettelkasten, I think it is true that some people use it that way.
Anyway, my point is not to complain about his characterization of the Zettelkasten, he mentioned another thing…]]></summary>

 Hey, I'm working on a watched movie list for myself (prepping for 2023). One of my hobbies is watching movies (I watch maybe 100-200+ a year - yes that's 2 movies a week, sometimes more! I don't have cable and don't watch much TV outside those times) and I like to track what I've already watched. I had one set-up in Obsidian, but one thing I didn't like was the lack of portability (Dataview can only be read within Obsidian). So , I was wondering if I could replicate this in Emacs Org-mode. 
 Here's an example - 1st is from Obsidian, 2nd is from Emacs. 
 Is there a way to have it automatically wrap at a certain width? 
 I'm aware of M-RET M-RET, but I'd like a more automatic way of doing this, so I can see about typing in my comments a little quicker. For example:
 | IMDB | [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13533944][tt13533944]] | | Watched | 2022-11-19 | | Genre | Horror | | Comment | It was okay. It's a "folk horror" and it does pretty well for that. I did enjoy the different "scenery" since the movie was filmed in | | | Ireland. | | Released | 10 Nov 2022 | | | | 
 Also, is it possible to render an image inside a table cell or column? 
 And finally, I was thinking of attaching a movie cover to each "movie" header but then, how do I reference the attachment into an inline image?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi People!
I'm an geosciences investigator based in Santiago, Chile.
I found about Zettelkasten a few weeks ago while navigating Wikipedia on Systems Theory -> Niklas Luhman.
It was nice to know about it and got me really excited about the possibilities.
I try to apply systemic thinking on my research, complex systems and stuff, which is really interesting for me but also gave me an (pretty bad) information overload a few years ago. Complex systems theory allows you to see links between disciplines, which also can make hard to focus on one thing at a time.
I struggled through my endless master thesis process. It got me sick for real. Concentrating was sometimes impossible even for whole weeks. Gracefully I ended it well a few months ago and now I'm a researcher, in the meantime I prepare myself for doing my phd (hopefully 2024 in Berlin).
With renovated energies, I'm gradually managing to find a new flow for my work and personal life. A really important part is to develop a workflow, combining project management, journaling, synchronization/backing between home and work devices, code software integration.
I use to take notes by hand in a notebook. I have several of them filled with research logs, scientific articles notes, theory notes, ideas, day/week journals. I tried (space)emacs and org-mode a couple of years ago, learned the basics to left it completely a month later.
Now I decided to base my workflow on digital notes. I've sneak into doom emacs with org-roam, obsidian and vscode with dendron.
I'm inclining in favor of having a note-taking workflow integrated with vscode instead of emacs, as I program in vscode.
Since deciding on digital note-taking systems choice paradox led to paralysis analysis. But today I finally started with a weakly planner on markdown, in any case it will be not worse than writing it on a physical notebook that will be forgotten.
Thanks for maintaining this nice community.
All the best

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my research so far for database libraries I want to use with SQLite.
  
Serialization/deserialization over raw SQL queries 
 sqlite-simple
 
 Query builders 
 Persistent + Esqueleto // Get used to template haskell.
 Beam // This doesn't use template haskell. This has the most SQL features, but can also be more verbose and seemingly more complex than other options.
 Selda // This looks simpler than beam.
 
  
Should database(data & schema) migration be included from the beginning? Or, can it be bolted onto my application later?
 Which ones are going to be the best for a relatively simple SQLite application in the long term? I'm going to need basic JOINs and basic CRUD operations with probably less than 20 tables. I want to minimize maintenance in the long term like 30 ~ 50 years. Churning is not desirable. I want to write it once and not have to worry about replacing a database library later for as long as I use my application while I'm alive. Most open-source projects are maintained by less than 3 people, so I can't expect other people to keep up with library churning.
 For terminal UI, I chose brick because brick seems good and extremely well maintained although it's mostly a one-man show. It seems brick may outlast the usefulness of my application. The man behind brick must be a vigorous guy who grew up with proper nutrition because I have never seen a better maintained open-source project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to keep notes about using Ruby in an .org file. When it comes to simple repetitions working well in Ruby's irb, e.g.
  irb(main):038:1* 3.times do irb(main):039:1* puts "greetings" irb(main):040:0> end greetings greetings greetings => 3 
 my assumption was I simply could use a fenced snippet of code such as
 ``` #+begin_src ruby :results code :exports both 3.times do puts "greetings" end #+end_src
 #+RESULTS: #+begin_src ruby 3 #+end_src ```
 however instead of the anticipated greetings, it is the return value 3 which shows up. By my configuration file, babel is aware about ruby, and C-c ' opens the box; there equally is syntax highlighting. Is there an additional parameter to be adjusted to get greetings shown thrice as in the irb?

I’ll do some advent of code problems in a lisp and things seem to go well but as soon as I get stuck it feels impossible to find a solution that makes any sense. In terms of elisp I’ll write simple functions but when digging into plug-in source code feel like there is no amount of study that could make me competent in the language. Is this just the start of the valley of imposter syndrome where you know enough to know what you’re ignorant about or the inability to make the paradigm shift to thinking in a “lispy / function” way? Not meaning to rant just curious how people broke through this barrier if anyone has felt the same.

learning #memory
It is not clear how to operationalize memory [[202211150901]] and thus how exactly to best use how memory works.
Clearly, there are good and bad methods of learning. For an exam, merely repeating the material is inferior to active questioning. Repetition trains recall, while active questioning trains the very behavior of being able to give answers to questions that is required in exams.
Perhaps this results in a hierarchy of learning methods?
Thesis: You should start with simple memory techniques and then work your way up to more complex ones.
Repetition
Active retrieval
Comprehension
Comment: This was part of the last note.
Thanks to the feedback, I have separated the two knowledge modules:
the problem of operationalization
the method inspired by the problem (still undeveloped).]]></summary>

 A very simple interface brining MilesMcBain's breakerofchains R package to Emacs. 
 Very briefly, this package allows you to break long R pipes (chains) and work with the intermediate output. Great for debugging. See MilesMcBain's readme for an example. See ess-breakerofchains readme for the single function interface.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw a demo over at EmacsConf that is related to tree-sitter and the presenter showed a helm chart file and showed fancy-narrow with it.
 If there is one format that I often use, it's helm chart files and they can be quite frustrating to edit; the error messages can be somewhat obscure at times, too, so any help I could get from Emacs would be fantastic. Even getting the indentation right can be really troublesome. I'm not sure if there is a good way to have Helm's extra syntax be handled better than yaml-mode seems to do.
 I installed the emacs-plus@29 on a Mac, and it seems to have some tree-sitter support in core, but it seems yaml support might not be there? Anyone else have tips on build(s) to use that might have this in there? From some of the activity it seemed it might be in the works; maybe nightly builds are needed to pick this up?

 edit: sorry, I think I should add that I'm using spacemacs and the config was added to my user-config section
 Every time I start emacs up, it recompiles the EmacSQL SQLite binary- it takes 20s every time, and it started doing that as I started to setup Org-roam. 
 Why? And can I improve this? 
 Relevant config:
  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/Notes/org-roam/")) :bind (("C-c n l" . org-roam-buffer-toggle) ("C-c n f" . org-roam-node-find) ("C-c n g" . org-roam-graph) ("C-c n i" . org-roam-node-insert) ("C-c n c" . org-roam-capture) ;; Dailies ("C-c n j" . org-roam-dailies-capture-today)) :config (org-roam-db-autosync-mode) ) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'toggle-word-wrap) 
 edit: I've commented out the relevant config for now - it starts up in 1.5s which seems more reasonable.

 First, native compilation comes in two modes: synchronous and asynchronous. I was getting the error when the file was being compiled asynchronously.
 It turns out that I'm using leaf where leaf is a macro. Asynchronous starts fresh and so it doesn't know that leaf is a macro and gets confused. So the remedy is to (eval-when-compile (require 'leaf)) at the top of the file.
 TL; DR -- the error above (with a file path and nothing after the proper-list-p is most likely an undefined macro hit during asynchronous compilation.

It could still be nice to attend something like a conference to learn some new skills and meet people.
 Does anyone know of conferences about Haskell or functional programming that are accessible for amateurs like me? Are you an amateur who has attended a conference? I'm curious to hear your thoughts and experiences. Personally, I'm most interested in looking into opportunities in the continental US, but feel free to reply about things happening elsewhere in the world too, in case other readers find it helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heya!
 Few days ago in an earlier thread I asked about any existing package for working with age encrypted files. Few folks pointed me in the right direction so I started working on this at https://codeberg.org/sochotnicky/age-mode
 The package is... experimental. There are a few known bugs (and many unknown I am sure). But things work in happy-path scenarios when you have correct identities defined and whatnot.
 I mostly copied over things from EPA package and adjusted for GPG->age differences (fortunately age is much simpler to work with). So when things are set up right you can get transparent age file decryption on file open and encryption on save. There's a few other accessory functions as well.
 Package needs some refactoring, more documentation, better error handling, support for different ways to specify recipients/identities, figuring out why editing over TRAMP saves unencrypted files and more. If someone feels like helping out I'd be happy to accept patches :-)
 I haven't really done that much elisp coding, but I've enjoyed the process so far. I am mostly just scratching my own itch here but who knows, it might help someone else...

 Flint is a YC company that's on a mission to fix American Healthcare by solving the nursing shortage crisis. We do this by removing barriers for international nurses to immigrate and build a career in the United States, and we are on track to help 1,000+ nurses immigrate by the end of next year (2023).
 We are growing quickly, and we need people to help us lay the foundation for our global healthcare workforce product. Our code is still young and you'd have a chance to leave your mark on the architecture.
 We're a distributed team and are considering candidates in the NA, SA, EMEA regions.
 If you're interested in this role, please apply here. Feel free to read more about our culture. You can also direct any questions to [wonchan@withflint.com](mailto:wonchan@withflint.com), thanks!

  [ Message {msg: "msg1", ...} Message {msg: "msg2", ...} Message {msg: "msg3", ...} ] 
 Bellow is what i can do so far. ```haskell newtype Messages = { messages :: [Message] } deriving Show
 data Message = Message { msg :: String, email :: String, role :: String, timeAt :: String } deriving Show
 instance FromJSON Message where parseJSON (Object v) = Message <$> v .: "msg" <> v.: "email" <> v.: "role" <*> v.: "timeAt" parseJSON _ = mzero
 instance FromJSON Messages where parseJSON (Array arr) = _todo ```
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to ask experienced emacs users on macos what their distro of choice is in late 2022. As a vimmer interested in emacs due to the vast customization capabilities and especially org-mode, I looked into trying it out for myself. It seemed as though the easiest way to get an idea of the potential of emacs was to install doom. I used the official guides on the repo and tried out both emacs-mac and emacs-plus with native comp. On my M1 macbook pro I experienced major cursor lag (when navigating through text files using vim bindings), they were so severe especially after coming from vim that i ended up removing doom entirely. Vanilla emacs didnt feel a 100% smooth either. Whats even weirder is that weeks after uninstalling emacs itself my computer still had a process running called emacs with 99% cpu useage and high gpu useage. After doing some digging, it seems that there are rendering issues on retina displays specifically that really mess up the responsiveness of the app. I read about different things to try such as using fira code as the font, changing the line highlighting behavior etc.
 ​
 Anyways, Before trying to fix something that seemed broken I want to try to install another build again, and I'd also be comfortable with vanilla emacs and configuring it on my own if it means stable performance. So what I want to know specifically is the following:
 In your opinion what are reliable distros and build options out of the following distros for M1 on a retina display in terms of responsiveness and light cpu/gpu useage?
 - emacs-mac
 - emacs-plus
 - emacsformacosx
 and would you ppl suggest with native comp or without?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Haskell FFI does not support directly passing structs in function definitions, but there is a way around it:
 Say foo and baz are structs. Given a function with signature
 bar fun1 (foo a, int b); 
 We can define a conversion that uses pointers instead:
 void wrapper (foo *a, int b, bar *out) { out* = (*a, b); } 
 Now say we have a different function defined as
 typedef bar (*cb) (foo a, int b); void fun2 (cb callback); 
 cb here can't be marshalled, just like fun1 in the first example, but now we need to wrap in the opposite direction: whatever C function we create has to input typedef bar* (*wrapped) (foo* a, int b) and output cb. This appears to be quite a non-trivial task within C. Is there a simpler solution to this I'm missing?

Though using all ten fingers to touch type, I notice the frequent use of the (left) control key to initiate/complete command chords strains my pinky; perhaps especially on a Thinkpad where the position of function key and Ctr are switched.
 While there are instructions how to remap C to an other key accessible with less crawl of the hand, I wonder: was remapping the function of the control key to an other key (e.g., caps lock) a technique frequently used prior to the advent of orgmode?

 I'm guessing the process would be; use Ubuntu Software to uninstall current Emacs, (perhaps delete the elpa Org directory and contents), then reinstall Emacs either using Ubuntu Software, or by sudo apt install.
 Any thoughts or recommendations much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tweaking emacs with satisfication is not easy, but I am trying to think how it would work efficiently. The problem of the naive emacs keybindings is that it over relies on the ctrl key, default layout of modern computer keyboard makes it effort-some to do navigation. In my opinion, the alt (or meta) key should be paid more attention as we can balance between those two kinds.
 The first thing I found is that using arrow keys to navigate is fine, but not efficient, as its up and down arrow is not so coherent, and most of times we need rely on the thumb to hit the keys separately. While ctrl-n and ctrl-p can be an alternative to move around between lines, the same as alt-n and alt-p, for which I would suggest that using it as forward-paragraph and backward-paragraph. It can be smoother as oppose to the ctrl-<down> and ctrl-<up>, in the mean time, you can utilize the other combinations such as alt-f, alt-b to move forward word or backward. In that sense, alt key becomes a bold version of ctrl key, since it jumps fast and corresponds to every navigation key that ctrl has. We can therefore switch between those two modifier keys to move in a small pace or in a larger pace without intervening the arrow keys. At the same time, we can assign more combinations to the prefix key alt-s corresponding the ctrl-x. If we can stay mostly at the left region, the keystroke would be more efficient. If we can utilize those two kinds to the best, we can balance the left and right region, such as buffer navigation uses right hand-side alt-[ and alt-], and buffer switch uses alt-\.
 I also want to listen to your suggestions, as I believe everyone has their own opinions and configurations to make a balance, not be overloaded, while be efficient.
 Edit: I have remapped caps to ctrl.

 I have been maintaining the official Haskell docker images for about 2 years now. I have tried to push the project forward in various ways and I’m pleased with where they are now.
 There is more work to be done, such as Alpine and Windows support (both almost done, but blocked on GHC issues or need a final push).
 Unfortunately, I don’t have much time anymore for anything other than basic maintenance. Most of my time is taken up by my day job and my 8 month old. I also no longer work in Haskell, which lowers my motivation. I’d like to hand off maintenance, ideally to multiple new maintainers.
 Is anyone interested? If so, you can post here or on this github issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking everywhere, but I can't seems to find any documentation on how to setup tree-sitter (the official one integrated in emacs 29). I know it is new and documentation might be missing for now. 
 I'm on mac and using these builds https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds and C-h v and system-configuration-features outputs this
 system-configuration-features is a variable defined in ‘C source code’. Its value is "ACL DBUS GIF GLIB GMP GNUTLS JPEG JSON LCMS2 LIBXML2 MODULES NATIVE_COMP NOTIFY KQUEUE NS PDUMPER PNG RSVG SQLITE3 THREADS TIFF TOOLKIT_SCROLL_BARS TREE_SITTER WEBP XIM XWIDGETS ZLIB" 
 So, it is compiled with tree-sitter. When I activate any major mode like js-ts-mode or tsx-ts-mode I get
 ⛔ Warning (treesit): Cannot activate tree-sitter, because language definition for javascript is unavailable (not-found): (libtree- sitter-javascript.so libtree-sitter-javascript.dylib) No such file or directory 
 How do I find languages definition and install them and make them available to emacs official tree-sitter?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I'm brand new to Haskell, diving in for the first time using advent of code as an excuse to try and learn the language. I'm trying to go out of my way to "play", to get a better sense of how the language works. I don't think the specific problem is important in this case, but I have run into some counter-intuitive behavior. 
 My code reads inputs from a file, then does some simple computation (parse String -> Tuple, then "score" that tuple which is just Tuple -> Integer). Then I want to sum the scores. I first did this with a sum and a map, but then realized I could do it in a single fold. Code like this:
 main :: IO () main = do contents <- readFile "input02t" let input = lines contents -- This takes ~2 seconds to run print $ sum $ map (score . readEntry) input -- Same answer, but this takes ~10 seconds to run print $ foldr ((+) . score . readEntry) 0 input 
 The time difference shocked me, because I expected equivalence. Is there a reason the fold takes so much longer than sum + map?

 Now, what do I have in the dot emacs file? Here is the snippet, which kicks in while emacs initialize...FYI 
 (setq org2blog/wp-image-upload t)
 ..and it is not helping the cause. Most of my recent ( year or so) have written with it and none of them contain any media file. If those have, then I must go to the website and upload it manually. This is exactly what I want to bypass. 
 ​
 Am I missing the obvious?? Oh, what did I do to get it along with the text? This is the exact step I follow, on the blog body ....
 [[ file ~/some_arbitrary_image_file_name]] 
 I am sure, emacs told me something when it failed to upload the image along with blogs and I can't get it from the top of my head right now.
 PS: I can embed video url with no problem whatsoever and it works bloody well. 
 ​
 ..and those of you inclined to help me, I might point you to my frivolous dot emacs file, you might glean on it ,if it has some violation of the specific part . 
 Here it is for your perusal: Dot emacs file for your information

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After experiencing how unholistic it feels configuring and extending VS Code, I started doing my research. I've tried Vim and Neovim more which has a fractured community. I question Vim's perceived efficiency with its keybindings and modal workflow but know it is universally available and quick to load.
 Testing Emacs for the first time opened my eyes and challenged what I thought I ever knew about it. The wealth of its built-in package manager with repos and extensibility is incredible. I thought it was all terminal focused but found out about the GUI and that a large majority of the community is using it. Now I am comfortable in the terminal but far from elite and have never tried a full terminal workflow. I'd like to hear from professional programmers and admins. What is your preferred choice?
 I want to know and grok the possibilities of using an editor inside a terminal, do you have more functionality, are you able to pipe things easier, etc. I know the benefits of the GUI in graphics and keybindings but is there feature loss or pain points when using something like vterm. Emacs is very flexible and there is many, many ways to complete work.
 In your opinion, should a person that wants to be the best programmer and admin possible focus on using GUI or Terminal Emacs? Thanks a million.

 What happened to the compiler? Or is it anyhow related to changes in basic runtime/prelude/GC?
 It has been a while since I fiddled with haskell, not followed GHC's development. Any idea about the cause?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a bit at a loss. I'm not that great with lisp and have been going through documentation for hours now.
 I saw that use-package supports directly customizing fonts through :custom-face which i would like to use to change some centaur tabs fonts. Before i did this "manually" with set-face-attribute. So far, i'm not getting errors, but my font also isn't getting applied. Additionally it seems things like :weight don't work here. So, could someone explain to me how this is done correctly?
 My current setup:
 (defvar PropFont) (setq PropFont "Inter") (use-package centaur-tabs :demand :straight t :init (centaur-tabs-mode t) :bind ("C-<prior>" . centaur-tabs-backward) ("C-<next>" . centaur-tabs-forward) :config (setq centaur-tabs-set-icons t) :custom (set-face-attribute 'centaur-tabs-selected-modified nil :family PropFont :weight 'bold :slant 'italic) (set-face-attribute 'centaur-tabs-unselected-modified nil :family PropFont :weight 'normal :slant 'italic) :custom-face (centaur-tabs-active-bar-face ((t (:family PropFont)))) (centaur-tabs-default ((t (:family PropFont)))) (centaur-tabs-selected ((t (:family PropFont)))) (centaur-tabs-unselected ((t (:family PropFont))))) 
 If you need more context i can put my entire init on pastebin or such, but this is all that's centaur tabs related.
 Any hint on what i'm doing wrong would be awesome.

Most people seem to recommend emacs, vim, or VS Code as their editor for Haskell. I'm not interested in using emacs or vim, so VS Code it is.
 I followed the recommendations on haskell.org and installed GHCup, and then using that installed GHC, cabal, stack, and the haskell language server, and then I installed the Haskell extension for VS Code. Then I noticed that extension doesn't seem to have a REPL or support for debugging, so I also installed the Haskell GHCi Debug Adapter extension.

 Example, js-indent-level value is 4. Eglot overwrite those 4 spaces with 1 <tab> making the indentation 8 spaces wide, which is Emacs default size.
 An option would be to set the default tab-size to 4. But I would rather having Eglot just using the indentation step defined in major-mode.
 Is there an option for this? I can't seem to find it.

 If the table have three columns with just short entries, I have no problem. But when the entries inside the table is long, the table extends to the right (outside the margin) of the page.
 Example:
 | Sequence | Score | Position | Remarks | |----------------------+-------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------| | TGCCGGCACCACCGCGTGTA | 97 | 1258 | This is a long text describing this sequence and another text here | | CGCGTGTAGGGCGGAGTAAA | 89 | 856 | Another long text in this second row of table | | CGGCACCACCGCGTGTAGGG | 91 | 21 | Another remark | 
 In the header I have this:
 #+title: Sample Paper in Org #+subtitle: Paper Presentation #+author: Some One #+latex_header: \usepackage[a4paper,text={6.25in,9in}, truedimen]{geometry} 
 I tried reading the org-mode manual but I couldn't figure it out how to make my table look nice.
 I did something like this:
 #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment tabu | Sequence | Score | Position | Remarks | |----------------------+-------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------| | TGCCGGCACCACCGCGTGTA | 97 | 1258 | This is a long text describing this sequence and another text here | | CGCGTGTAGGGCGGAGTAAA | 89 | 856 | Another long text in this second row of table | | CGGCACCACCGCGTGTAGGG | 91 | 21 | Another remark | 
 and in the header I add: #+latex_header: \usepackage{tabu}.
 The result is the same:

 Is there any way how can I fix this?

 EDIT: I invoke the M-x org-pandoc-export-to-latex-pdf keybindings to generate the PDF.
 EDIT: By the way, I am using Doom Emacs.

 git clone --origin origin --no-checkout https\://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs/nongnu.git /home/centy/.config/emacs/straight/repos/nongnu-elpa/ --no-single-branch 
 Also fails with the same error when I run it from the command line. 
 That error I've tracked to a "no-fix" in 2016 from RMS himself… https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=22690
 I find it hard to believe that other "build-from-master, using-straight" folk have not found some kind of workaround.
 What am I missing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm putting the finishing touches on my second "real" Haskell project*, and now that I find myself (mostly) able to get some (simple, practical) stuff done with the language, I'd like to spend some time learning more about how to put types to work.
 I mostly-get some of the basic big ideas: make invalid states un-representable, e.g. Use a type that encodes your constraints in some way (like NonEmpty!). I found lots of good advice in this blog post, and several others by the same author. (I tried to put it to work in my own code, restricting the domain of a finicky function, which felt like a nice, if small, win.)
 Anyway, I feel like I'm still only scratching the surface. Reading posts like this or the "types" section in the "State of the Haskell ecosystem" gets me really excited, but doesn't leave me with much in the way of practical advice.
 Are there are good/recommended resources for digging deeper into this kind of stuff? I stumbled across Thinking with Types today, which seems like it could be a good fit. I also see there's a chapter on "Basic Type Level Programming" in Production Haskell. I've also found various blogs and reddit posts, of course, but nothing super-comprehensive. (And "Type-driven development" sounds cool, but I'm not ready to branch into Idris yet.)
 I'd love any recommendations, pointers, tips-and-tricks... whatever you've got to offer! Thanks!
 ​
 \Any feedback is welcome, by the way, if anybody feels like digging through beginner code. It feels weird to work/learn in a vacuum. Looking at it now I already see some deficiencies, but I'm sure there are plenty that I don't see...*

 I've looked around but so far haven't found any package that would provide support for working with Age-encrypted files: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age
 I am strongly considering just writing some helper methods etc. I see some potential problems. For example ideally I'd love to have an editing support where I open age encrypted file, it gets unencrypted in the buffer and reencrypted on save, but not sure it is possible to easily re-encrypt file to the same recipients (without hardcoding a list in code/variable)
 Anyway - thought I'd ask if there's anything that already exists by any chance and I just missed it (age is not exactly a searchable term).

 import Data.Constraint (Constraint, Dict (..), type (:-) (..)) type family All :: (k -> Constraint) -> [k] -> Constraint type family All c xs where All _ '[] = () All c (x ': xs) = (c x, All c xs) 
 However, GHC is unable to figure out the following:
 type T :: [Type] -> Type foo :: All Monoid r => T r -> Bool bar :: All Semigroup r => T r -> Bool baz :: All Monoid r => T r -> Bool baz t = foo t && bar t -- This is an error: cannot deduce `All Semigroup r` from `All Monoid r` -- The workaround solution is to change the type of `baz` to baz :: (All Monoid r, All Semigroup r) => T r -> Bool -- but this is pretty annoying and cumbersome -- `All Monoid r` does imply `All Semigroup r`, I just need to prove it to GHC 
 One solution is to write a function with the type below, however I have no clue how to go about it
 -- | Map a constraint implication across a type-level list mapImpl :: (forall a. c1 a :- c2 a) -> All c1 r :- All c2 r mapImpl = Sub Dict -- ERROR 
 Is this possible? Or would some implementation require additional class constraints on r. Any help would be appreciated!

I got a really nice development environment for RJSX and as a matter of fact, I would still be using that as my main editing suite for RJSX and using it professionally but I have to admit. I have spent around 3 months with Doom Emacs now and in that time I also started following along system crafters videos to build my own config but I have to say that unfortunately, I'm a person that switches often between a lot of different languages and platforms and tools. 
 e.g. While I'm working as a freelancer in RJSX I also develop blender plugins and I'm also learning unreal engine 5 and WebGL on the side.
 For someone like me, I was finding that I'd have to spend 3-4 days dedicatedly crafting an environment for every new requirement I have. I do a lot of different minor development-related things and this was really killing my will to work. 
 But, emacs did force me to learn evil mode for editing and I have to say I'd always use that till the day I die now. I cannot imagine how I didn't. I also added a magit plugin and an org mode plugin on vscode and also using the vspacecode plugin for spacemacs like keybindings now. 
 My affair with emacs would definitely continue for a long time, I'm sure. But unfortunately, the barrier of entry is rather high for someone like me who wants to do a lot of things and honestly for the time being I'd have to hop back to VSCode to edit a lot of different things. I am a little disappointed but still hopeful that I'd be back some time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I want to create a one line function "argmax" using fold where I enter an anonymous/lambda function and a list. Then I apply the function to the list and get a new list based on the function. Now I get the maximum value of the second list and return the element from the first list which created the maximum value when applied to the function.
 It should look like this:
 Input: argmax (\x -> mod x 5) [1,4,7]
 the second list should be: [1,4,2]
 The Maximum element from the second list is 4 so it should return 4 from the first list, because mod 4 5 is 4.
 So the output should be: 4
 Currently I have this:
 argmax :: (Ord a) => a -> [a] -> a
 argmax f xs = foldr max f xs
 but it doesnt work for a anonymous function
 I get this error: No instance for (Show (Integer -> Integer))
 which I don't really understand.
 I tried to change the type signature, but that did not help.
 thanks in advance! ^

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I added this in my config a long time ago, unusually enough I didn't add a link to a source site. And I don't recall finding out about it myself.
 After a recent experiment trying not using company nor fido/icomplete, I found it again, and it seems that it doesn't make any difference at all no matter where I try it.
 I was looking at the source a few minutes ago and usage within icomplete.el but couldn't quite crack what is it about. From the name I assumed something like "use icomplete for capf" but that doesn't seem to be the case from looking at icomplete sources.
 Does anyone know what does this variable do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm using the "olivetti" package with a line width of 80 characters (olivetti-body-width 80). The text is centered. This setting works fine for a fixed-pitch font. However, when I'm using a variable-pitch font such as Times New Roman, the 80 characters per line allow up to 100 characters per line to fit. This is due to the nature of variable-pitch fonts where characters are not equal in width like monospaced fonts.
 100 characters per line is too long for optimal reading and increasing the font size doesn't help. The font is already at a large size. 
 What would be the solution? To reduce the olivetti 80 characters per line setting to 70 characters per line which will compensate for the variable pitch font? But that will cause the programming modes that use a fixed-pitch font to have short lines.

 narrow to a certain subset of them (say 5 or so)

 list them in column view
  
taken a couple shots at this as well as searching on things like org-collector but not really finding an easy way to do this (which makes org-mode look way harded than obsidian where I did this with dataview pretty simply)
 Anyone got any pointers to something similar or an example. My lisp-fu is weak (looks down at floor) so thought I'd ask for help rather than thrash here.
