        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to use eglot with the R language server. However, eglot does not seem to work well with either RMarkdown or Quarto documents as it hangs every time entering when enter a code chunk (up to 5 seconds or so). I am guessing it does this because it disconnects when entering the markdown mode and then needs to reconnect again. I am not sure. 
 I have two questions.
  
How might I be able to overcome this re-connection(?) issue with quarto or rmarkdown documents and still use eglot?
 Alternatively, how can I enable eglot just for *.r or *.R files and not just for ess-r-mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I added flycheck onto the list package-selected-packages and ran (package-install-selected-packages) after reopening Emacs:
 (setq package-selected-packages '(use-package lsp-mode lsp-ui lsp-treemacs dap-mode company-mode flycheck prism aggressive-indent haskell-mode lsp-haskell)) 
 Then, I added this to my init.el (I use use-package):
 (use-package flycheck :init (global-flycheck-mode)) 
 However, even after doing that, when I open Emacs, I still get this error:
 Error (use-package): flycheck/:init: Symbol’s function definition is void: global-flycheck-mode
 It's strange, because even though I installed flycheck, the function seems to be undefined. The use-package configuration is what they recommend on their website, as well (scroll to find the use-package section), so I don't think the problem is calling (global-flycheck-mode).
 Does anyone have tips for what I should do next?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have a created a class called Task that contains SignalRef and then an instance from that class
 case class Task(id: String,, cancel: IO[SignallingRef[IO, Boolean]]) val task = Task(randomUUID().toString, SignallingRef[IO, Boolean](false)) 
 Thereafter, I put the task in a Map and calling it from two different streams.
 The first one is called from an HTTP request to set its value to “true”
  case DELETE -> Root / "tasks" / UUIDVar(taskId) => taskMap.get(taskId.toString) match { case Some(task) => for{ switch <- task.cancel _ <- switch.set(true).start >> IO.println("canceled") res <- Ok(task.toOutput.asJson) } yield res case None => NotFound("Not Found") 
 and the other one is called from a "stream.interruptWhen" to cancel the stream when the value become "true"
  val httpStream = for { cancelSwitch <- Stream.eval(task.cancel) httpStream <- client .stream(req) .flatMap(_.body) .through(decodeUsingHeaders[CsvRow[String]]()) .interruptWhen(cancelSwitch) .map(x => x.toMap) .map(x => x.asJson.noSpaces + "\n") .through(text.utf8.encode) .through(Files[IO].writeAll(Path(s"jsons/${task.id}.json"), Flags.Write)) } yield httpStream httpStream.compile.drain 
 And it appears that I am doing something wrong because they don't communicate with each other.
 P.S. I am Golang developer interested in the functional programming of Scala and its libraries CE3, FS2 and ZIO

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm newer to Haskell (know the syntax, some of the ideas behind certain stuff, but haven't used it for anything serious), and I've always heard that Haskell based some of it's concepts on category theory (monads, hask). Are there more abstract concepts in Haskell? Such as higher category theory and the Yoneda lemma. I've heard category theory be described as the linguistics of mathematics, so it only makes sense for it to have actually been used on a language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. 
 I use Doom Emacs with lsp enabled. 
 I develop in PHP using Laravel framework. There's a package called laravel-ide-helper that creates stub classes to help on IDE completion for properties and magic methods. 
 The problem is, when I x-ref-find I get two results, one for the correct method and another for the stub (they are all in a file called _ide_helper.php). 
 Is there a way I can filter out these results? Maybe blacklist the filename somehow?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I came across this stackoverflow post and tried to implement my own StateIO monad where I could perform IO actions. Here is my code:
 {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} import Control.Monad.Trans import Control.Monad (ap, liftM) newtype StateIO s a = StateIO {runStateIO :: s -> IO (a, s)} instance Functor (StateIO s) where fmap = liftM instance Applicative (StateIO s) where pure = return (<*>) = ap instance Monad (StateIO s) where return a = StateIO $ \s -> return (a, s) n >>= k = StateIO $ \s -> do (a, s') <- runStateIO n s runStateIO (k a) s instance MonadIO (StateIO s) where liftIO io = StateIO $ \st -> do x <- io return (x, st) class Monad m => MonadStateIO s m | m -> s where getSt :: m s putSt :: s -> m () instance MonadStateIO s (StateIO s) where getSt = StateIO $ \st -> return (st,st) putSt st = StateIO $ const $ return ((),st) 
 Then I run a simple program where the user inputs a positive integer n and I return the first n fibonacci numbers with the use of the StateIO monad. 
 type FibNums = [Int] main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "How many fibonacci numbers do you want to see:" n <- (read <$> getLine) :: IO Int let initialState = [n,0,1] process initialState process :: FibNums -> IO () process st = do (finished, newSt) <- runStateIO addFib st print finished -- for debugging print newSt -- for debugging if finished then do putStrLn "Fibonacci numbers are:" print $ tail newSt else process newSt addFib :: StateIO FibNums Bool addFib = do st <- getSt let newSt = st ++ [last st + last (init st)] finished = length (tail newSt) == head newSt liftIO $ print newSt -- for debugging putSt newSt return finished 
 The problem is in the function addFib the line "putSt newSt" does not really update the FibNums state variable and the initial state is returned. So the program loops on forever. 
 Any ideas what am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often find myself switching between Emacs and terminal (e.g. xterm). A typical example is to run a test suite after editing some code. For years, I've been looking for a clean way to send code directly to a terminal without copy-pasting, and I think I finally found it. Best hack I've come up with in 12 years of using this editor. Here it is:
  
Install the absolutely excellent vterm package:https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm
 Create the following script, put it somewhere reasonable:#!/bin/bashemacsclient -e "(progn (vterm) (vterm-send-string \"$*\") (vterm-send-return))"
 Install ob-tmux and configure:https://github.com/ahendriksen/ob-tmux(setq org-babel-tmux-terminal "<PATH TO THE BASH SCRIPT ABOVE>")(setq org-babel-tmux-terminal-opts nil)
 Enjoy!
 (e.t.a: with (setq vterm-enable-manipulate-selection-data-by-osc52 t) you also get integration between tmux visual mode and the kill-ring, which depending on your habits may be a more ergonomic way to copy/paste between terminal and emacs)

 As part of a project at university, I'm looking to formalize and implement a small DSL for proving statements in first-order logic based on Fitch notation. I'm going to implement this in Haskell.
 The implementation itself would not be a huge problem if I were to go by intuition alone, seeing as natural deduction in first-order logic is quite simple. However, since this is a project for university, I wanted to ask if you guys can recommend some interesting papers on various techniques and approaches (e.g. dependent type theory) that might be of use to me?
 Thanks!

 Currently, I have M-Backspace mapped to backward-kill-word be default, but I do not want to get used to that one because I use C-Backspace outside of Emacs. What is the best solution here? I have looked online and did not find solutions that work exactly like I want. Some remapped C-h which is not what I want to do.
 I am using wsl 2 ubuntu if that matters at all.

 Suppose I have the following JSON:

 "type" can have a lot of values and in essence decides what "someObject" will be. I will omit moreFieldsAlwaysKnown for brevity. 
 I like typesafety so I naively thought I would encode this statically to make it users of my lib very difficult to create invalid values and track everything on the typelevel. In essence:

 Where helper and performCheck require the implicit user argument. Actually there's almost identical calls to more than one helper (and more than 5 params, don't get me started about that), but I think the pattern is clear.
 I'd like to refactor that into something like
 class DoerOffStuff { doIt(typeArg) { (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5) => { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, typeArg, arg3, arg4,arg5) } } val doItThisWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_A) val doItThatWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_B) val doItAnotherWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_C) } 
 I want to avoid having to type the argument list in the class definition, so I wanted to stick with val instead.
 Is there a way I can do that?
 I tried
 class DoerOffStuff { doIt(typeArg) { (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user) => { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, typeArg, arg3, arg4,arg5) } } val doItThisWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_A) val doItThatWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_B) val doItAnotherWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_C) } 
 but the the type checker will say "could not find implicit value for parameter user" for all places of ... = doIt(...)

What's important though is that these workflows are about switching between different types of file -- it would be very cumbersome to add all of the different pairs manually.

 Hi guys. I know this must be possible. But can you give me some examples in Haskell? Something like representing naturals and booleans with types, writing plus and if/else for them, etc.
 ​
 BTW, is Haskell's type inference engine Turing complete? I guess the answer is no. But why? Does UndecidableInstances have anything to do with this?
 ​
 Obviously, this question doesn't have a lot of practical value. It's a rabbit hole. Sorry for that. I'm just interested. And would be glad to hear from FP experts in our Reddit giving me some hints.

 Thanks all for your informative replies! I have had a busy day. Read your comments tomorrow!

The server needs some css and js files that I can include with juliusFile and luciusFile from the shakespeare library. If I add the files to extra-source-files in my cabal file the modules that need them even get automatically rebuild, when I change one of them.
 But I don’t want to write plain javascript or css. I‘d much rather write sass or typescript. So I need to compile those files so js or css if their source changes.
 Right now I use a custom build script with a custom buildHook that extracts the extra-source-files from the cabal file and builds them according to some build rules written in shake.
 How are bigger projects accomplishing this? Are they just using a makefile. Are they dropping cabal alltogether and only use shake? I know thats what GHC is doing, with their hadrian build system.
 I would love to hear of your experiences with different approaches! And yes I am procrastinating writing the thing I want to write really hard right now.

 After interacting with some redditors and doing some more research I wrote this comment where I concluded that the way Sublime Text handles line composed of whitespace is the most intuitive for me, at least when editing Python source files. Which can be summarized as:
 If I'm editing a buffer with the following Python code
 if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅print('2x⋅True')$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅| 
 where ⋅ represents a space, $ represents a newline and | represents the cursor, if I press Return I want Emacs to end up like
 if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅print('2x⋅True')$ $ ⋅⋅⋅⋅| 
 instead of
 if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅print('2x⋅True'…]]></summary>

 ld: warning: -undefined dynamic_lookup may not work with chained fixups 
 I've already cleared out ~/.stack, so it should not be using any old artifacts, with all artifacts being rebuilt on 12.6.
 It's not that big of a deal, but it would be nice to get rid of it.
 Note: I was running into warnings like
 ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/opt/postgresql@12/lib/libpq.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (12.0) than being linked (11.1) 
 I fixed this by completely uninstalling Homebrew, reinstalling xcode-select, and reinstalling everything. I suspect I'm getting this new warning because xcode-select upgraded ld.

My apologies if the title sounds vague, I'm looking for advice or project ideas to secure an introduction to frameworks such as Play,‍ Akka and Spark. and to how they are being used in real world applications. I have some background in Rust, so getting familiar with Scala was pretty straightforward. I'm loving the language a lot and how natural it feels. However, I would like to start building some hobby projects by using the aforementioned frameworks if possible, but I'm not really sure where to start, or which of them is more beginner-intermediate-friendly. May I ask; does anyone mind suggesting a learning roadmap or drop some project suggestions/ideas? I'd deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance. Stay safe and healthy everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A friend at an old workplace told me this morning that his boss told him they were all switching to VSCode and it was going to be a company mandate. It's not the first time I've heard people be dismissive of long time Emacs/Vim users. My last personal experience was someone telling me flat out I was wasting company time playing around with Emacs rather than using Pycharm.
 I have also gotten into long arguments that devolve into "feature-offs" where I have to explain how a feature VSCode has is also in Emacs. I tried to explain that you can use GDB in Emacs, and someone literally laughed at me because GDB is "ancient" and VSCode's debugging is modern and actually gets stuff done. It seems like even if Emacs can do something it's also A. Not good enough B. Takes too long to configure instead of just getting the job done.
 So please give me some advice on how I should combat this encroachment on my peaceful Emacs pasture. Or should I just give up my goats and switch to VSCode?

 Im having a lot of fun taking my university (electronic engineering) notes in org-mode, using org-fragtog to toggle org-latex-preview and see math equations take life in real time.
 I'd really like to do the same thing with circuits, so I'm trying to use these tikz and circuitikz packages that let you draw circuits in latex.
 It compiles just fine, in fact when I export to pdf (SPC-m-e-l-o) the drawings are there.
 org-latex-preview also seem to try, very hard the first times I go over something, so my best guess is it's actually compiling and actually thinking it's showing it regularly, but no it doesn't. 
 Has someone had any similar experience? or any idea on how to move forward? 
 Thank you guys

Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.

Don’t worry (about writing Haskell), be happy (writing Agda instead)! by Jesper Cockx
As we all know, static type systems are great to ensure correctness of our programs. Sadly, in industry many people are forced to work in languages with a weak type system, such as Haskell.
Haskell and Visual Studio by Monday Morning Haskell
Most of the IDEs out there use graphical interfaces that let you use the mouse. Today we’ll explore one of those options - Visual Studio (aka VS Code).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was inspired by a question at the end of the Being lazy without being bloated presentation about the library nothunks, which asked if it was possible to do the same check statically.
 I managed to come up with a type class IsStrict which will give a type error if there is a non-strict field anywhere, at any depth, in the data structure given, explaining where the non-strict field is.
 Here it is in a gist: https://gist.github.com/anka-213/440cfef8c8712f5df747029640cfe170
 For example, if one were to ask if String is strict, it would give this error:  Found lazy field of type Char • In constructor: : • In type: [Char] • When checking strictness of: String Found lazy field of type [Char] • In constructor: : • In type: [Char] • When checking strictness of: String 
 It still works if we put the string inside some other data type, e.g. a strict pair ``` data StrictPair a b = P !a !b deriving Generic
 -- Non-strict type in strict field -- >>> nfStrict @(StrictPair Int String) -- Found lazy field of type Char -- • In constructor: : -- • In type: [Char] -- • In strict field of type [Char] -- • In constructor: P -- • In type: StrictPair Int String -- • When checking strictness of: StrictPair Int String -- ... ```
 This is of course more strict than checking nothunks, since you might have forced the data in some other way, so the data is thunk-free without having the data type be fully strict.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, Im starting to learn some common-lisp but im struggling to get my IDE running correctly.
 I'm using a clean Emacs (v. 26) and have installed slime on it.
 I've got the following hello.cl and init.el
 https://gist.github.com/LucyJohnson-lua4life/e8c97bf931b7fd5795f5b9b22739c19d.
 I started "slime" and executed "slime-compile-and-load-file" on hello.cl, then i moved my cursor to the "some-function" symbol and executed "slime-who-calls". By now I would expect slime to show me the 3 other lines where "some-function" was executed but instead i got "No references found for some-function".
 Can somebody explain me how to fix this, or how to debug that?

By mistake I pressed a key that i shouldn't( I don't remember which one) and the file was moved somewhere but I cannot find where. I used find, and locate but nothing. I don't have a trash can folder on my system so its rather impossible to have moved it there by mistake. 
 Does emacs, or dired provide any sort of "history of moved files" or something similar that will help me find the file?

 the only thing i miss is being able to see the code actions available in the modeline and the project error list from flymake (not just the current buffer) in the modeline.
 It would be nice if there was a way to go to the previous/next error in project.
 anyone would know how to do that?
 flymake-show-project-diagnostics with eglot is so much better than lsp-treemacs tho, i love it just for that...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having recently been bitten by an unexpected failed Future, I was wondering if there is anything like a "safe" wrapper for Futures. Basically, the goal is to make concurrent API's inside an application not to have the hidden back-channel behaviour, yet still be composable in the usual way. A minimal implementation might be on the base Future to do a .transformWith(t => Future.successful(t.toEither)) and then return that or wrap in EitherT, maybe wrapping either of those result types.
 Would need to support stack-safe flatMap for Cats-effect. 
 Just speculating, thinking aloud here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I'm trying to wean myself off the actor model. I've grown used to thinking of systems as supervision trees. How to represent these trees without actors? E.g., let's imagine this tree structure is my app:
 - app: my app - scheduler: should wake up every quarter hour (0m, 15m, 30m, 45m) and perform a task - my_svc_pool: connection pool to a service that is called from within the scheduled task - my_svc: connection to my service - my_svc: another connection to my service 
 So let's say scheduler wakes up, tries to run its task by calling out to my_svc_pool, but the particular connection that it got routed to in the pool happened to get disconnected right before that. So the service call fails and scheduler blows up and goes away, leaving my app running without the 15-minute scheduled tasks that were supposed to happen.
 How would you structure an app with futures or tasks or any effect system (leaving aside actors) to supervise the system as a whole such that:
  
If a service connection in the connection pool happened to get disconnected and we just found out, my_svc_pool should safely dispose of it and replace it
 If scheduler blows up on waking up and trying to perform its task, app should replace it with a fresh one

In this post I will describe the approach that I’ve recently introduced in rules_haskell
to achieve clear, maintainable and efficient tests for Bazel rules.

Why even bother?
All software needs to be tested and verified, and Bazel rules are no exception. Some of them are
popular public libraries with a lot of projects depending on them, and they need a proper test set
to allow every contributor, frequent or occasional, to propose a change with little risk of breaking the
public API those rules represents. The same applies to the rules that live in huge monorepos growing every day,
where they often act as a glue between different components and can become complex, tricky and fragile.
Also every Bazel rule introduces…]]></summary>

 How can I do this with ZIO? I tried memoize, but, if I map over the task 2 times within a for, it is "cached", but if I call getFruits() 2 times from a zio-http api, well, it goes to the DB again.
 So I have something like this
 DAO:
 case class QueryService(quill: Quill.Cassandra[Literal]) { val fruits: Quoted[EntityQuery[Fruit]] = quote { querySchema[Fruit]("fruits") } } object QueryService { val live: URLayer[Quill.Cassandra[Literal], QueryService] = ZLayer.fromFunction(QueryService(_)) } case class FruitsDao(queryService: QueryService) { def allFruits: Task[Seq[Fruit]] = run( queryService.fruits ) } object FruitsDao { val live: ZLayer[QueryService, Nothing, FruitsDao] = ZLayer.fromFunction(FruitsDao(_)) } 
 service:
  val fruits: Task[Seq[Fruit] = dao.allFruits def getFruits(): Task[Seq[Fruit]] = { val res = for { f <- fruits //f2 <- fruits // memoize would only help here } yield doSomethingWithFruits(fruits) 
 and this is called from zio-http

 When I insert a new line in my Java file, I get a lovely, sexy tab for indentation inserted automatically.
 When I press the backspace key to delete the tab, all my tabs are changed into spaces. This disgusts me. It angers me. I am close to homicidal.
 Does anyone know how to stop this?
 I have tried running "indent-tabs-mode t", but that does nothing, which makes sense, because tabs are already enabled.
 The functionality I want is simple. Tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment. When I delete a tab, it deletes the tab. When I delete a space, it deletes the space.
 I've been googling for quite a while, and can't seem to figure it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm creating a wrapper around a pre-compiled C library (GLFW, I know bindings exist, it's for figuring out how to use the Haskell FFI in a practical setting), and I haven't been able to figure out how to get stack to include the C headers in the build. 
 This means that my build works, but I get a number of warnings about implicit function declarations during compilation. e.g.:
 C:\Users\****\AppData\Local\Temp\ghc23648_0\ghc_5.c:8:61: error: warning: implicit declaration of function 'glfwInit' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration] 8 | HsInt32 ghczuwrapperZC1ZCmainZCMainZCglfwInit(void) {return glfwInit();} [...] 8 | HsInt32 ghczuwrapperZC1ZCmainZCMainZCglfwInit(void) {return glfwInit();} 
 I figured out how to add C libraries in package.yaml with extra-lib-dirs: and extra-libraries:. Unfortunately, when I browse the internet, the field it suggests for adding headers in Cabal, includes:, doesn't actually get recognized by Stack:
 C:\Users\****\Workspace\Testing\ffitest\package.yaml: Ignoring unrecognized field $.executables.ffitest-exe.includes 
 Just to be sure, I tried to use the same field in stack.yaml instead, just in case it would be recognized there. It causes the same error.
 What is the appropriate way to include C header files in a Stack project, assuming there is one?

 Hi everyone,
 Today I finally decided to not just watch videos about Haskell but giving it a quick try to see how it works and feels.
 Since I just wanted to get a feel, I didn't want to start installing everything (especially because it was more than one step like downloading one file and installing it, lazy here) so I just went for the many Haskell browser consoles (replit for example) and I just couldn't do anything that I see in the many YouTube tutorials because of this "main =" thingy. I then tried with a "main = do" and writing under it but nothing works as in the tutorial, example "sumOfNums = [1..1000]" among many others.
 What can I do if I want to just play around, test basic functions etc in a browser ? It seems that I am supposed to already know some level of coding architecture and in every basic tutorial I watched there isn't any mention of such main = ...
 It's puzzling me how incredibly complicated this simple beginner step seems to be when comparing to, say, groovy web console, in which you can just type things, functions, classes etc...
 Thanks guys !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The transient package has a macro transient-define-prefix (docs). The following defines a complete prefix:
 (setq l1 '(("vl" "visual lines" visual-line-mode))) (transient-define-prefix foo1 () "docstring" [:pad-keys t ["Appearance" l1]]) 
 (The macro allows for a list of "elements" like l1 to be interpolated, something like a ,@ splice in a backtick context.)
 But having the variable l1 lying around feels like a loose end. The following approach looks better:
 (let ((l2 '(("vl" "visual lines" visual-line-mode)))) (transient-define-prefix foo2 () "docstring" [:pad-keys t ["Appearance" l2]])) 
 But it fails with "Symbol’s value as variable is void: l2"
 My understanding of elisp scope is clearly lacking.
 Is the problem that the transient-define-prefix macro is expanded within the let scope but the result is not evaluated until after the let scope is discarded? The elisp documentation for macros says that "[t]he Lisp interpreter proceeds to evaluate the expansion as soon as it comes back from the macro" but I may be misunderstanding this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to implement the following function, for working with cyclical musical scales:
 cyclicIndex :: [a] -> Int -> a -- cyclicIndex is total in its second argument -- provided its first argument is total and not infinite cyclicIndex xs i = xs !! (i mod N) where N = length xs i mod N = unique representative of NZ+i in [0..N) 
 My attempt is
 cyclicIndex :: [a] -> Int -> a cyclicIndex xs i = if i >= 0 then (cycle xs) !! i else (cycle (reverse xs)) !! (-1-i) 
 This seems to work, and the function is a simple enough function, but I am having trouble reasoning about its correctness from my specification. My attempts at calculating its correctness runs into confusion about mod in Haskell and mod in maths. In particular, I noted down the laws
  
cycle xs !! i = xs !! (mod n i) for i >= 0 (note the mod is Haskell's mod)
 reverse xs !! i = xs !! (N - 1 - i) for i in [0..N)
 cycle . reverse = reverse . cycle? (A free theorem? Useful?)
  
How might we approach this correctness problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I want to run emacs inside a development container (as I'm using Fedora Silverblue), but I'm having a weird issue:
 My config files are all in ~/.config/emacs/, but just after the launch of the container (distrobox-enter), emacs creates ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d and ignores the config folder.
 If I stop emacs, delete ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d and restart emacs, my init.el in ~/.config/emacs/ is considered and emacs starts configured the proper way.
 For now I think I will just move my config folder, but if you think this is an issue I might need to report on the mailing list, or if you can help me investigate a bit more, feel free to help me!

 Any assistance is appreciated.

 any time i evaluate the code block passing variable b into function (it's external file's table) it puts that external file top into buffer-flip (as if i just switched from that external file).
 example say i flip between buffer1 (where above code block is) and buffer 2 (buffer1 > buffer2 > buffer 1 > buffer 2, etc), but when i evaluate the code buffer flip becomes (buffer 1 > external file > buffer 1 > eternal file)
 if i evalute the code passing variable a into function (local table) - buffer flip works correctly.
 I am not sure that's buffer flip's package problem that's why i am asking here first - maybe i am missing some emacs / org-mode setting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been about 20 years since I used Windows, but I just started in a new position where I need to get up and running with it. I've got a lot of my config working already, but I don't get how to do external package-management at all. My config is littered with :ensure-system-package statements that all fail. I've installed Debian subsystem and also mingw, but I don't get how I can tie either of them in. I have found a few blog-posts about Emacs on Windows, but those were more about trivial things that I were able to figure out on my own.
 So. 1) Does the concept of PATH exist on Windows? \ 1.1) Can the PATH be changed to include something either from mingw or Debian subsystem?
 Looks like starting up the subsystem takes some time, so I'm also worried about performance. \ 2) Should I be going about this in another way entirely?

I was having a conversation one day and I couldn’t recall the name of a term, something I learned from a YouTube video. That bothered me. After the chat I went back to YouTube, found the video, and started searching through it. I increased the playback speed and went back and forth but still couldn’t find it. After a few minutes of that struggle, I thought: “what the heck am I doing?”. Then I wrote a tiny elisp function to extract subtitles. While reading through the subs I realized how much good stuff went past my ears (while watching the video).
  
It's tiny and very simple, but I think can be used already.

Although this is enough to do basic editing, I would like to learn emacs "the emacs way", as I'm not a vimmer. I'm just using doom emacs as a crutch while I get comfortable with emacs and lisp.
 ​
 Anyway, I've tried the following:
 comment out (evil +everywhere) with two semi colons in "~/.doom.d/init.el"
 ran doom sync
 added (package! evil-mode :disable t) to "packages.el"
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 deleted (evil +everywhere) from "init.el" completely
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 removed +bindings from :config default in "init.el"
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 ​
 I'm not sure what else I should try.
 ​
 EDIT: rebooted my machine and evil is no more. Not sure at which point I could/should have rebooted but here we are.

 In vim, I currently have it set up so that when a line soft wraps, it will be indented by one tab width compared to the first line, as seen here: https://imgur.com/X6GTuaL
 In emacs, I have visual-line-mode and org-indent-mode enabled, which makes the soft wrapped lines flush with the first line (seen here: https://imgur.com/4xfBZnJ). I searched through google and any settings I could think of, but cannot find a way to indent the wrapped lines in emacs the same was as it is in vim.
 Is there a setting I'm missing, or a package that will do this for me? If not, is this something that could be done in lisp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've encountered a design issue several times, and I'm wondering what approach is most consistent with Haskell idioms/best practices.
 I'm implementing a data structure, call it Z a, with an interface for manipulating it where almost all of the functions in the interface return a Z a, with many of the form Z a -> Z a or b -> Z a -> Z a. But for a few of the functions there's no valid result for some edge case inputs, and it makes sense in those situations to return Maybe (Z a). 
 Now at that point, it makes sense to have every function in the interface return Maybe (Z a) because I can then sequence my operations nicely with >>= 
 z :: Z a z >>= op1 >>= op2 >>= (op3 x) >>= (op4 1 2) 
 or something like
 pipe :: (Foldable t, Monad m) => a -> t (a -> m a) -> m a pipe = foldM (&) z :: Z a pipe z [op1, op2, op3 x, op4 1 2] 
 This is pretty convenient, I suppose, but then just one or two operations that have a Maybe result changed the entire interface to the data structure. An alternative would be to make the data structure itself an instance of Monad and make everything again -> Z a. There are several advantages of internalizing, e.g., I can carry some extra information in the Nothing case or even have several failure paths; and several disadvantages -- the non maybe'd functions now have to do the boilerplate to check for the Nothing-ish inputs and pass them along for every function, whereas Maybe does that automatically.
 My question is what are the Haskell best practices/idioms for this decision. Where is the boundary for the choice between internalizing the Monad instance in the data structure type itself and just using something like Maybe for *all* the functions in the interface. 
 I hope my question is clear. Thanks for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Lately, I've been defining my own regular expressions for parsing errors in the *compilation* buffers by adding entries to the compilation-error-regexp-alist and compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variables. However, there's a problem. This list already contains an enormous amount of regular expressions for all kinds of languages that I don't use, however, these regular expressions also match errors of the language that I'm trying to add support to, and this results in extracting incorrect paths to files containing errors. I've set compilation-error-regexp-alist to nil and the problem disappeared, but now when I byte-compile elisp files, I get no way to jump to problems from the compilation buffer (well, duh, the regexp list now doesn't contain an entry for elisp).
 So this creates a problem. I want my regular expressions to be the only ones present in the list when I'm working on a project in this language, and I want other regexps to be available when I'm working on other projects. I've thought about using dir-locals.el but my regexps use functions to get the file out of the error message, and I can't put that into dir-locals reliably.
 Another problem is that the compilation-error-regexp-alist contains names of the languages it supports, but for example, there's no elisp or emacs-lisp entry, yet the byte-compile warnings are highlighted correctly. And there's no way to see what regular expressions are responsible for the matches in the compilation buffer, so it's hard to debug what's overriding mine.
 TL;DR: Ideally, I want compilation-error-regexp-alist to be configurable per project but I use custom functions that can break other people's configurations who work on the same project as me and load dir-locals.el

 For instance, if asked to a URL and then a description, all you see in the minibuffer is "clipboard/kill value:" repeatedly.
 Is there a way to customise that prompt? Or maybe have placeholders with useful names in the template that get overwritten?

 Does anyone have a hack that does this? I know that the project is essentially unmaintained at this point, but hopefully there's someone in the community who knows. I think it would involve using the Conversation ID in the new API and using something like the existing twittering-get-replied-statuses function.

 Here's the problem. I'm trying to find definitions for a struct, but eglot can't find it.
 ​
 file.cpp has a function
 function (struct type_t *t1, ...) {
 type_t *temp = t1; // this line here
 }
 ​
 When I do xref-find-definition for type_t, it simply shows me the "struct type_t *t1" in the file above.
 type_t is defined in another header, which this file includes. Why can't eglot/xref jump to the definition in the file that defines type_t? lsp-mode, there's no issue at all. (I am compiling my code with bear to get a compile_commands.json file).
 ​
 What am I missing?

 It would take quite a bit of time (we are talking 0.3s but enough to be annoying) to exit the normal mode when inside a tmux session. It would then do some crazy things too between those 0.3s if I start typing some letters...
 I discovered this spacemacs issue and buried in the comments this tmux setting : 
 set -s escape-time 0 
 which works exactly as intended and give you an exit to normal mode straight away...
 so if anyone else has this issue and find this post then I guess you are welcome internet stranger :)

 Does it have anything similar for reading E-mail?
 Most modes that I know of are part of another package (like Gnus or Wanderlust or Mew, etc.) but lets imagine I've fetched my E-mail via some other means; home-grown, if you will.
 I, now, want to read them but I don't want to roll my own mode to do so; repurposing another package's for this purpose would probably likewise be fine so long as it could be isolated from the rest of the package (e.g. mh-show? But we'd want to avoid accidentally triggering mh-rmail while using mh-show, for example).
 I can't seem to find a Mail mode equivalent but for reading mail, instead of sending.

 My reasons. Sometimes I need to move things around, align, or split to have a clearer structure. AUCTeX does not seem to respond well for that kind of manual writing and neglect all the work after hitting TAB or ENTER.
 I used to work with Atom, in which idea about indentation was very simple: when I decided to move cursor two extra tabs to the right, all following lines would hold on that indentation until I'd changed it. This helped me to structure long equations to see them better.
 I hope whatever I wrote make sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working through this blog post on building a simple interpreter, which uses the type Expr Value to describe an expression which evaluates to a value, and Expr (Value -> Value) to describe an expression which evaluates to a function. 
 Now, the type constructor Expr has kind *->* by default, which I think is too general. I see no situation when we would put anything other than functions involving Value into it, and I think it could count as a programmer error if there was a value Expr a, where a is not in F, where F ::= Value | F -> F.
 Questions:
  
Is there a way to enforce this constraint in Haskell, e.g. using type families?
 Is there a nice way to describe F in Haskell?
  
One additional challenge is that data Expr a = ClosedExpr a | OpenExpr Name (Expr (Value -> a)) has useful functor and applicative instances, which I hope can remain.

 In general, is there a common interface for this kind of stuff or its all language server dependent?
 Specifically I am using eglot with the digestif language server for editing latex documents but my question is a bit more general. What prompted this questino is a "Wrong length of dash may have been used" warning that I want to just ignore in the future. 
 Thank!

This will be the next paper I will process. It is highly relevant for the next material for the Zettelkasten Method. Right now, I am processing the application to physics which is also a nice read.
To me, the key learning for the Zettelkasten Method is the heavy emphasis on decision making. I can't express it precise enough to communicate it nicely. But there is a striking similarity to learning the Zettelkasten Method. Right now, many people try to learn it as if they learn something from a textbook. It feels rather "formulaic". But it is important to get a feel for the implicit decisions you make through your actions. Yes, there are principles and good practices. But they will not serve you well if you are not aware of there rational.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a heavy user of TRAMP and I'm always looking for ways to improve the speed of my setup. Specifically, the pain points with TRAMP shows up mostly in dired and magit, where the turnaround speed (time spent to open a folder in dired, or time spend in any magit command) is quite high. I suspect this is due to the underlying process that TRAMP uses to connect to my remote server. My remote connection is relatively fast (100Mbps+). Things that I have tried till now are:
  
For my remote server, set the following flags in .ssh/config such that TRAMP re-uses the connections
  
 Host myfasthost ... Compression yes ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p ControlMaster auto ControlPersist 90m 
  
I use scp protocol to connect to TRAMP in dired. For example, to open a remote folder /path/to/my/folder, I use the following:
  
 /scp:myfasthost:/path/to/my/folder 
 Is there any other protocols I can use to ensure faster connections? Or any other tips/hacks to improve the TRAMP dired+magit experience? TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am about to start a new project in Haskell, model checking with (new) tree-like data structures. I think it is best to start building on a library such that i can already have elegant base functions, yet i am wondering what library is currently the standard? I read about fgl ( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl ), yet it is a very old library. 
 It is a proof-of-concept project, thus i would like to do this in Haskell (clean mathematical code + modularity) instead of a lower level language (C++, C).
 In my project i will need: 
  
memoization (during a recursive depth-first traversal)
 
labelled edges
 
nodes have values corresponding to a ordinal indicating their level.
 
some special nodes which transform my traversal function's interpretation.
 
labelled leaf nodes
 
 Any recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After trying to refresh my email setup, I ended up mistakenly (i.e. deliberately, but without considering the consequence) updating mu and mu4e. I was on version 1.5.5, and I've ended up on 1.8.9.
 This upgrade does seem to break a lot of my little tweaks to mu4e. I've managed to sort a few of these out, e.g. mu4e~proc-remove-id becomes mu4e--server-remove-id, mu4e~mark-check-target becomes mu4e--mark-check-target .
 But there are still a few bugs. I previously stole a function to convert an email to a .pdf file:
 (defun mu4e-action-open-to-pdf (msg) (let* ((date (mu4e-message-field msg :date)) (infile (mu4e~write-body-to-html msg)) (outfile (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d%H%M%S.pdf" date))) (with-temp-buffer (shell-command (format "wkhtmltopdf %s ~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s" infile outfile) t)) (interactive) (find-file (format "~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s" outfile) ) )) 
 Now mu4e~write-body-html is no longer defined.
 My questions are:
  
Is there a replacement for mu4e~write-body-html? Or a different method to convert a message to pdf?
 
I've tried to follow the release notes here, but find it hard to follow... for instance, the releases jump from 1.4.15 to 1.6.0? (So where is 1.5.5?) Is there a compilation of all these changes from e.g. ~ to -- and other general refactoring?
 
 EDIT:
 Just found this warning in the documentation:
 The whole of mu4e consists of hundreds of elisp functions. However, the majority of those are for internal use only; you can recognize them easily, because they all start with mu4e~ or mu4e--. These functions make all kinds of assumptions, and they are subject to change, and should therefore not be used. 
 which explains the instability. Didn't see this/know enough about elisp when I stole the functions. Fair enough.

Undoubtedly the worst binding I’ve had to deal with is C-x on emacs. I took the suggestion from the emacswiki and swapped C-u and C-x. I barely use C-u anyway, and this places C-x right under the pointer in the home row, which is very comfortable. Common sequences like C-x C-s and C-x C-e become optimal homerow rolls.
  
I was wondering how to do that natively in emacs without using karabiner/xmodmap or other OS dependent solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announcing the posit-3.2 library, where Real numbers are approximated by Maybe Rational. The Posit type is mapped to a 2's complement integer type; smoothly and with tapering precision, in a similar way to the projective real line.
 The implementation includes word sizes from 8 to 256 bits.
 The library is implemented with several Haskell Language extensions:
 {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} -- For our main type Posit (es :: ES) {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} -- For our ES kind and the constructors Z, I, II, III, IV, V for exponent size type {-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-} -- For defining the type of kind ES that indexes the GADT {-# LANGUAGE ViewPatterns #-} -- To decode the posit in the pattern {-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-} -- Added Strictness for some fixed point algorithms {-# LANGUAGE PatternSynonyms #-} -- for a nice NaR interface {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} -- To make instances for each specific type from Posit8 to Posit256 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-} -- Allow non-type variables in the constraints {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-} -- To apply types: with '@', it seems to select the specific class instance {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} -- To convert between Posit Types {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} -- To reduce some code duplication {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-} -- To reduce some code duplication, I think the code is decidable but GHC is not smart enough ;) 
 The one area that I think Haskell or my understanding of Haskell can improve is with some code duplication in the internal 'PositC' class. It would be neat to be able to make default implementations of class functions that are polymorphic over an associated type.
 Enjoy!

 I was happily using autostart (KDE Neon) to launch emacs emacs --daemon and connecting with the client. I reinstalled both emacs and doom to try to get org-roam working properly, and now I've lost daemon mode.
 If I run emacs --daemon in Konsole, I get:
  Warning: due to a long standing Gtk+ bug https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/221 Emacs might crash when run in daemon mode and the X11 connection is unexpectedly lost. Using an Emacs configured with --with-x-toolkit=lucid does not have this problem. Starting Emacs daemon. [yas] Check your `yas-snippet-dirs': /home/MYUSER/.doom.d/snippets/ is not a directory [yas] Prepared just-in-time loading of snippets with some errors. Check *Messages*. evil-collection error: (file-missing Opening directory No such file or directory /home/MYUSER/home/MYUSER/roam) 
 I'm unable to connect to the daemon with a client
 I'm using doom, but this doesn't seem to be a doom-specific issue. I can't see anything in my config that is creating the duplication of /home/MYUSER/

 I've only been using Emacs for about 4 days now, so I am by no means an expert at this, but since the beginning of the day, whenever I open a haskell file in Emacs it becomes EXTREMELY sluggish. I can successfully exit it, and enter any other filetype, but it does not react the same way as when I do it with haskell
 Here is a video:

 Around 0:26 is when I open the haskell file

 Math templates don't work in cdlatex mode - for example when I have $fr$ (or fr in \begin{math}...\end{math}) and press tab when the cursor is after r, it doesn't expand to \frac{}{}.
 I tried this in both org-cdlatex-mode and .tex files. Things marked as TEXT or TEXT/MATH in org-cdlatex-command-help work, the ones marked as MATH don't - pressing tab just moves the cursor out of the math environment
 What's wrong?
 Edit: solved by installing auctex

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use the builtin completion at point in eshell to complete command arguments. E.g in eshell I'd type cd and hit <TAB>:
 ~ $ cd 
 to open up the *Completions* buffer. Im currently using emacs 29.0.50 (commit 72c64dd73c), and so M-<down> and M-<up> can cycle through the completions (directories in this case with the cd command), while keeping the eshell buffer focused. The problem I'm facing now is how to actually insert the currently highlighted completion into my eshell buffer. Clicking on the completion with the mouse will insert it into eshell, as well as switching focus to the *Completions* buffer and hitting RET over it, but I'm trying to do this without having to switch focus from eshell. M-<up> and M-<down>, added new in emacs 29, allow cycling through completions while keeping focus in the current window (my eshell in this case), but I cant select one. The command minibuffer-choose-completion, which is bound to M-RET returns an error saying "Text is read only", which I think is happening because it is trying to insert the completion into the minibuffer and not my eshell window. Moreover, completion-at-point for symbols in elisp files works as intended with M-RET, but not for eshell. Any help on how to sort this would be great. Thanks in advance

 I've been using orderless with some custom dispatchers for a while now, but I've always felt like something was wrong or too complex when using the OR operator (regex: \(pattern1\|pattern2\)).
 So today I invested half a hour into learn basics of Elisp string operations and have created my own dispatcher for that.
 (defun or-regexp (pattern index _total) (cond ((string-suffix-p "|" pattern) `(orderless-regexp . ,(concat "\\(" (concat (s-replace "|" "\\|" (substring pattern 0 -1)) "\\)")))) ((string-match-p "|" pattern) `(orderless-regexp . ,(concat "\\(" (concat (s-replace "|" "\\|" pattern) "\\)")))))) 
 I assume it's not the prettiest code, but it's enough for me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In "On Intellectual Craftsmanship" (1952), C. Wright Mills talks about his methods for note taking, thinking, and analysis in what he calls "sociological imagination". This is a sociologists' framing of their own research and analysis practice and thus bears a sociological related name. While he talks more about the thinking, outlining, and writing process rather than the mechanical portion of how he takes notes or what he uses, he's extending significantly on the ideas and methods that Sönke Ahrens describes in How to Take Smart Notes (2017), though obviously he's doing it 65 years earlier. It would seem obvious that the specific methods (using either files, note cards, notebooks, etc.) were a bit more commonplace for his time and context, so he spent more of his time on the finer and tou…]]></summary>

 Now I'd like to pre-compile all the eln files ahead of time, so emacs does not compile the files every time the container spins up again.

 I have set EMACSNATIVELOADPATH which seems to avoid that doom generates eln files in the tmp directory.
 I have set
 (setq native-comp-eln-load-path '("/home/emre/local/lib/emacs/28.2/native-lisp/")) 
 I have tried stuff like
 emacs --debug-init -q --no-site-file --batch --eval "(progn (load \"/home/emre/.emacs.d/early-init.el\") (require 'doom) (require 'doom-lib) (require 'doom-start) (setq package-native-compile t) (setq native-comp-async-jobs-number 8) (setq comp-deferred-compilation nil) (byte-force-recompile \"/home/emre/local/share/emacs/28.2\") (native-compile-async \"/home/emre/local/share/emacs/28.2\" t) (while (or comp-files-queue (> (comp-async-runnings) 0)) (progn (message \"Items left to compile %s\" (length comp-files-queue)) (sleep-for 1))) (kill-emacs))" 
 Which doesn't seem to work either ... 
 Has anyone an idea how I can achieve pre-compiling all eln files, that are shown in the output window?

 I copy text (outside of emacs) that can be one of these lines:
 57,655 45,049 45,363 (57,655) (45,049) (45,363) 57,655) (45,049) (45,363 57,655 45,049 45,363 $ 57,655 $ 45,049 $ 45,363 
 (amount of spaces/tabs can very, and number of elements is 3 most of the time, sometimes two)
 And need to paste it either as
 57,655|45,049|45,363 
 Or as
 (57,655)|(45,049)|(45,363) 
 (basically ignore everything except digits and "," and separate elements with "|")
 As i understand i need to create 2 custom paste functions (one regular, one with "()"s) taking original paste function as basis. I found the pasting function (via c-h k):
 (defun cua-paste (arg) "Paste last cut or copied region or rectangle. An active region is deleted before executing the command. With numeric prefix arg, paste from register 0-9 instead. If global mark is active, copy from register or one character." (interactive "P") (setq arg (cua--prefix-arg arg)) (let ((regtxt (and cua--register (get-register cua--register))) (count (prefix-numeric-value arg))) (cond ((and cua--register (not regtxt)) (message "Nothing in register %c" cua--register)) (cua--global-mark-active (if regtxt (cua--insert-at-global-mark regtxt) (when (not (eobp)) (cua--insert-at-global-mark (filter-buffer-substring (point) (+ (point) count))) (forward-char count)))) (buffer-read-only (error "Cannot paste into a read-only buffer")) (t (cond (regtxt (cond ;; This being a cons implies cua-rect is loaded? ((consp regtxt) (cua--insert-rectangle regtxt)) ((stringp regtxt) (insert-for-yank regtxt)) (t (message "Unknown data in register %c" cua--register)))) ((memq this-original-command '(clipboard-yank x-clipboard-yank)) (funcall this-original-command)) (t (yank arg))))))) 
 and as i understand i need to modify "arg" before doing "yank arg", but i have not idea how this "modification" should look like :) Could someone please help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[… would it be possible to implement it?
 I’m thinking of the lambda calculus as purely functional language with only anonymous functions. We could introduce recursion with the Y-combinator (λf. (λx. f (x x)) (λx. f (x x)). In the Haskell idiom it would be: (\f -> (\x -> f (x x)) (\x -> f (x x)) which will give us an error because of Haskell’s type system. 
  • Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: t0 ~ t0 -> t • In the first argument of ‘x2’, namely ‘x2’ In the first argument of ‘f’, namely ‘(x2 x2)’ In the expression: f (x2 x2) • Relevant bindings include x2 :: t0 -> t (bound at <interactive>:19:40) f :: t -> t (bound at <interactive>:19:12) y :: (t -> t) -> t (bound at <interactive>:19:5) 
 Is there any other way we could introduce recursion to Haskell if it wasn’t there already?

It demands the .so module requires recompilation at the drop of a hat. For some reason trying to run vterm after restarting Emacs requires it to be recompiled. It is as if the module itself is missing or Doom detects that some related source files have changed.
 
The vterm windows don't have modelines or titles around them and that makes it hard to tell them apart when they are split. Is there some way to set these?

 This year, I'm participating in Hacktoberfest as a mentor and maintainer. And I'm happy to offer my mentorship in the following two projects:
  
Haskell Beginners 2022 — a Haskell course for complete beginners. It doesn't require any prior FP knowledge at all! And it's format is perfectly suitable for Hacktoberfest. Read more information in how to participate instructions.
 Iris — a Haskell CLI framework I created earlier this year. It's still at the early stage. But it has tons of beginner-friendly issues! Check out issues with the "hacktoberfest" label.
  
Feel free to ask any questions!
 Also, please, don't hesitate to share your projects that participate in Hacktoberfest this year as well! 🤗

 Emacs usually opens the third window with a horizontal split, and I hate that. Say a daily note in org-roam. I would like to tell emacs there should always be two windows, opened side-by-side, not three, not one, no horizontal split. How do I do that?

 ​
 The readme does not specify this, but the Code itself seems fairly small, i tried understanding it (its hard for me to understand), it seems it mentions something about arguments input, and as specified by "man pdf2svg" i should be able to supply page number as argument so i tried doing:
 ```

 with no luck, hopefully a clever guy here knows how i can do this?

 I didn’t pay attention until recently, but I keep seeing the following warning while byte-compiling my preference files:
  Warning: ‘string-as-unibyte’ is an obsolete function (as of 26.1); use ‘encode-coding-string’. 
 I use the following code to convert arbitrary text (usually utf-8, but may be something else):
  (base64-encode-string (string-as-unibyte (buffer-string)) 'no-line-break) 
 I did look at the encode-coding-string, but what bother me is that it seems that I’m obliged to set the original coding-system. But in my case it can change from time to time.
 Is there a way to keep the same "magical" behavior of string-as-unibyte function, with which I didn’t have to assume a possibly wrong source coding system? Am I correct if I say it’d be the undecided coding system? As in:
  (base64-encode-string (encode-coding-string (buffer-string) 'undecided) 'no-line-break) 
 As I’m reading the whole buffer content, is there a (local) variable holding the current buffer coding system?
 Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, my company Mercury is hosting a Haskell meetup on October 20th, 2022 at 6 PM in downtown Portland. If you're interested in giving a talk, we have slots for 25 minute and 5 minute talks. Talks already planned include:
 ​
 Practical STM: An Async Job Queue, by Jake Keuhlen
 ​
  
In this talk, we’ll walk through a brief introduction to concurrency and one of Haskell’s best tools for dealing with it: software transactional memory (STM). We’ll then use STM to build a simple but powerful asynchronous job queue.
  
Make your own Haskell, by Mitchell Vitez
 ​
  
We'll explore the process of making our own Haskell-like language. Composition will lead us to trees, and trees will lead us to languages. We'll grow, trim, typecheck, and reorganize these trees, populating our own little forested enclave. Finally, we'll discover why our language can't really be represented by a tree after all.
  
​
 We'll have pizza delivered and the event will be bartended.
 The event is at the Power + Light Building, at 920 Southwest 6th Avenue.
 Please RSVP here if you're interested: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/haskell-talks-at-mercury-tickets-424633328717. Note: You must RSVP through Eventbrite for building security to let you in.

When you search a page in Dynalist, you get search results in the context of each parent line ("parent" as determined by indentation level). The same goal is accomplished in ogrep.
 Is this type of search possible in emacs? In org-mode, I know there is sparse-tree, but it is not as "sparse" as ogrep or Dynalist, giving much more context than I sometimes need. This feature is so valuable to me that I'll have to craft a solution with your suggestions if one doesn’t yet exist.

 I have an issue with the argument(s) to add at the end either it is $*, $1, $2 etc.
 When I have: alias mv eshell/mv --interactive --verbose $1 $2 it works for moving a single file but obviously fails when I'm trying to do mv foo1 foo2 foo3 bar/ (same story for cp). 
 So the question is: how can I use the Eshell version of mv/cp with an alias in the Eshell alias file?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem with updating, upgrading and syncing Doom profiles is that you need to ensure that the ~/.doom.d and the path to bin/doom for the profiles do not conflict in your shell and I had to do some experimentation using ~/.emacs-profiles.el and ~/.doom.d/init.el to get this approach working.
 It is based on the idea that when managing your Doom installation with the doom sync, doom build etc commands you run the commands in vterm or term sessions from the same Chemacs2 session.
 You might consider this post an attempt to get others to find any bugs in my approach as I just got it working and the it works on my system caveat applies.
 Settings in ~/.emacs-profiles.el
  ("doom01" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/doom") (env . (("DOOMDIR" . "~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/config") ("DOOMPATH" . "~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/doom/bin") ("CHEMACS2PROFILE" . "doom01") )) )) 
 Command in $DOOMDIR/init.el
  (setenv "PATH" (concat (expand-file-name (getenv "DOOMPATH") "") ":" (getenv "PATH"))) 
 The setenv command in the Doom config's init.el sets the path to bin/doom in that profile and ~/.doom.d is automatically taken care of by DOOMDIR.
 With the $PATH variable including the path to the relevant bin\doom vterm and term inherit them automatically and the doom xxxx commands work as expected.
 The values in ~/.emacs-profiles.el and that command in init.el are the sole source of truth for mantaining that Doom installations. You don't need to set environment variables or paths anywhere else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Very long time emacs user here with a bunch of elisp under my belt - but this simple problem just eludes me.
 For years, I've done all my testing and running in a compile window.
 Emacs knows error messages that appear in that window, and I can use either M-x next-error to get to the error, or hit return on that line.
 This works pretty well flawlessly for me... but now I have a new tool and only a few of its errors get highlighted this way and I cannot see the difference!
 For example, in the run below, only the second error (fasteners.py) is highlighted and can be reached through next-error or carriage return: see https://imgur.com/a/I6P3egg
 -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: "/code/engora-search/" -*- Compilation started at Thu Sep 29 23:34:35 $ TERM=dumb d engora test --refurb engora/network/request/url_request.py:37:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/parser/fasteners.py:107:9 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/server/search.py:26:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/server/server.py:39:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` Run `refurb --explain ERR` to further explain an error. Use `--quiet` to silence this message 
 Why?
 My only theory was that fasteners.py:107:9 had three digits, the others two, but no: https://imgur.com/a/zgZ85M4 
 The output is already going through my own Python program, so I could easily rewrite it a bit without having to touch the refurb source - if I knew what was wrong.
  
Any ideas? This isn't a game blocker for me at all, but it's weirdly frustrating because I can't work it out. :-D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running Eglot or lsp-mode while working on remote files seems to be a common and rather problematic use-case, so I'm trying to understand why so many people need this.
 I have several projects where I can't or am not allowed to execute any code locally, and instead have a remote machine available for computations. But I've never encountered a project were I can't have the source code itself locally. So what I do is to edit the code locally and periodically sync it with the remote machine.
 The syncing part is admittedly a bit awkward, but there are ways to make it easier or mostly automatic. And then all Emacs features and external tools work fast and smoothly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's two problems I'm running into; the first was, as the title says, that all messages in my Inbox would get marked as ancient except, maybe, a few at the top.
 This would happen every time; if I wait a day (and, so, have new E-mails come in) and then open Gnus again for the first time? All new E-mails marked as ancient.
 And then, recently, the E-mails just stopped showing.
 I'd already edited the Group's parameters to include (visible . t) and turned off scoring. I tried gnus-summary-show-all-threads and gnus-summary-limit-include-dormant (nothing happened and I was informed there were no dormant articles, respectively); I tried C-u M-g (I actually think this is what's causing the previous messages to not show up anymore, other than any which are still marked as new in my Inbox).
 I just want to display all messages and for their status to reflect what's on the E-mail server; if it's new there, Gnus should show new, etc. I'm not using any offline storing or anything, just nnimap. Is there any easy way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-mode for taking notes, mostly math and physics these days, typing LaTeX equations inside org files. For this I use doom emacs.
 I've seen that with markup markers such as "*" (bold) and "/" (italics), org-hide-emphasis-markers allows for showing the effect in the text while getting rid of the cumbersome markers. Moreover, when the point is within markers, they show so one can edit them.
 I was wondering if it is possible to do the same with LaTeX environments like "\begin{equation}" and "\end{equation}", for instance. I've tried with hide-lines.el, which allows for hiding lines matching a regex (in this case, the regex are, for instance: "^\\begin{[a-z]*}"). But although this works, it is far from ideal, as one would need to toggle their visibility for editing them, unlike the more practical way that org-emphasis-hide-markers allows for.
 Is there a way to achieve such result? Thanks in advance for all your help.
 Edit:
 To be clear, I would like to enter something like:
 \begin{equation}
 A = B
 \end{equation}
 and have emacs hide the first and third lines when away from the region, so that only
 A = B
 shows. If possible, I would also like to be able to see the delimiters whenever the point visits the A = B line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use to get Emacs for Mac OS X but now I just download the latest source tarball. I do:  ./configure --with-ns make make install sudo xattr -rds com.apple.quarantine nextstep/Emacs.app  and then move the app bundle to /Applications. But that's not what I'm here to talk about 😃
 When macOS switched to zsh I went through a painful transition. Before then, I had my ns-command-modifier set to meta so M-x would be cmd X for me. With bash, that was ok.
 But zsh opened new possibilities for me and it really wanted the meta on the options key rather than the command key. I honestly don't remember what the pain point was. But in any case, I remapped my emacs to be just the defaults where ns-option-modifier is set to meta and ns-command-modifier is set to super. zsh and emacs have a lot of common abilities so I wanted the key mappings to be the same in both. Rather than twist zsh to accept my unique setup I untwisted my unique emacs setup to be more normal.
 Now, I have an entire set of keys, the "super" keys that I've never had easy access to before.
 For example, using tabs in emacs, I can bind s-{ to tab-previous and s-} to tab-next and switch between tabs just like it was Safari. Instead of two key C-c p for Projectile, (they even suggest), one key s-p. I'm mapping s-r to projectile-rails, s-y to Yari, etc.
 It was and still is a bit painful of a transition but it is well worth it.

 My installation of HLS on Visual Studio Code / Linux Mint 20.3 doesn't work. It complains that it cannot determine my version of GHC. But HLS doesn't even do that.
 I enabled debugging as per the manual:
  
Right click on Haskell extension
 Extension settings
 At the bottom of the list: 
 Haskell > Trace:Client set to debug
 Haskell > Trace:Server set to messages
 
 Restart VSCode
 Load the file - error messages...
 Go to OUTPUT tab
 Right side, select Haskell
  
And is says this:
 "Connection to server is erroring. Shutting down server."
 "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by /home/francis/.ghcup/tmp/ghcup-ghc-8.10.7_cabal-3.6.2.0_hls-1.8.0.0_stack-2.7.5/haskell-language-server-wrapper)"
 If I run ldd -- version it returns GLIBC 2.31
 Any thoughts please.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I visit file foo.py, Emacs opens it in python-mode because the extension ".py" appears in auto-mode-alist This is true even if the file doesn't yet exist.
 However, if I simply create a new buffer called foo.py, using M-x switch-to-buffer, without tying it to a file, the new buffer is opened in fundamental-mode.
 Is there a way to set a new buffer's major mode based on its buffer name, rather than (or in addition to) its filename? I haven't found any hooks that would do the trick. Conversely, is there any reason why I don't want to do this?
 Thanks,
 (ETAA: this is slightly different from this question. That one is about setting the one mode to use in a new buffer. Mine is about calling a function to choose a mode dynamically. But that question seems to imply that there's no hook to do what I want.)

It was not easy to learn how put things away slowly, so that I‘ll be ready quickly when needed. Investing time now for time later. It means changing my personal workflow I‘ve trained over years.
And I‘m happy with the results. In the „Project Notes“ section of my Zettelkasten I now can find 73 smart sketchnotes I’ve already published here on LinkedIn, on Twitter or Instagram.
When did you start with your Zettelkasten? What‘s your learning experience?

We're writing to remind you that the OAuth out-of-band (OOB) flow will be deprecated on October 3, 2022, to protect your users from phishing and app impersonation attacks. [...] 
 If you have already migrated your app(s) to an alternative OAuth method, no further action is required. Please note that if your app(s) is natively installed you may have to request your users to update the app to the newer version to stop using the OOB method.
  
Their "more information" page: https://developers.googleblog.com/2022/02/making-oauth-flows-safer.html
 This leads me to this page for setting up oauth on desktop: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#redirect-uri_loopback and I must say that I don't understand at all what it is I'm supposed to do. 
 For reference, I looked at this similar reddit post from 4 months ago, but I don't know if this alternative oauth documentation was out yet: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/v3gfyp/continuing_with_orggcal_after_google_deprecates/

 I have observed many intermittent "hanging" of emacs on macOS for several months.
 This has not ever happened to me. At first it looked that I could trigger this feature when using mu4e, opening an html message and scrolling with an arrow downwards. This happened often but not immediately. Because I thought maybe this was mu4e related I chose to use a diffrent client (notmuch). Using notmuch the "hanging" did not happen. However, lately I noticed that the "hanging" could happen using consult-ripgrep searching a 2G sharepoint. And now also during just navigating between frames (on laptop and to screens).
 Q: what things could I do to get an idea what triggers emacs to hang? I do not mind recompiling emacs with special options if needed. Thank you, Marcel

 Python (ScalaPy) support has been gradually introduced in the last few releases, along with supporting Markdown (compiling and running Scala code in .md files) and Spark / Hadoop. You might also notice a lot of recent efforts focusing on improving backwards compatibility with scala/scalac. 
 For those who do not know it, Scala CLI is a command-line tool to interact with the Scala language. It's great for learning the language, writing scripts, prototyping and such.

 To have the right overview over the length of the current chapter, I wrote a function that counts the number of characters, starting from the outline-up-heading to the outline-forward-same-level, and divides them by 1.800 to give me a feeling for the number of pages the current chapter has.
 If I start the function in the last chapter, though, I get the error message "No following same-level heading". Of course, there is none, and I'd like to use point-max in this case. But how can I find out whether I'm in the last chapter, using elisp? Is there a way to find out whether there is a header of the same level following?

 (1) It feels like a big overhead. I don't feel I have time for journalling / processing notes each day; 
 (2) I am concerned that the very beginning of my roam career is crucial to success, and I may develop bad habits or bad practices which will hold my Zettel back; and
 (3) I live on mobile, and roam workflows are not mobile friendly.
 I'd be interested in testing, by reflecting on the experience of others, the following assumptions I have:
 (a) that roam isn't necessary in a professional environment. I already subscribe to regularly-updated professional resources full of hyperlinks;
 (b) that roam doesn't replace my current org-mode setup of a GTD-like system (which I also struggle to review regularly). Rather it sits alongside it as a "reference" asset;
 (c) that the biggest use of org-roam for me would be in hobbies. For example if I wanted to make a video tutorial, or blog post;
 (d) roam isn't a place to store sensitive everyday information (like passport no, social security details etc); and
 (d) roam is not mobile friendly (I hear logseq works, but only for v1)

 Is it possible to program such service using only Haskell? Or maybe writing pure functions in dll to be called from some Windows-friendly language will be a better solution?

 ```hs (#>) :: Logger a -> (a -> Logger b) -> Logger b Logger la a #> f = let Logger lb b = f a in Logger (la++lb) b 
 compute :: Int -> Logger Int compute x = square x #> add #> double ```
 1) How does this let statement get used? Firstly it contains lb, which isn't passed to the #> function as a parameter, so where does it come from. Secondly, I understand something like let x = 5 in something, where the compiler looks for x in something and replaces it with 5. But in this case Logger lb b doesn't appear anywhere in the in expression, nor does a. So what is it replacing?
 2) How can the compute function call #> without proper parameters? I understand that functions can be partially applied (i.e. you don't pass the last parameter), but in this case we aren't even passing the first parameter - square is not a Logger. (UPDATE: This question is less important than 1) and there's more code for it in the comments, I don't want to make this too big)
 I don't understand this syntax at all.

However, it seems to work differently, because when I use my "normal" workflow to work with hooks, it errors out, saying "wrong number of arguments".
 My normal workflow consists of defining a function that activates or de-activates stuff, and I call the function via ADD-HOOK. So far, I've not had problems with this workflow.

 ``` ;; LSP Part of my emacs.d 
 (use-package lsp-mode :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l") :hook ((python-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :commands lsp)
 (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook #'lsp) (add-hook 'haskell-literate-mode-hook #'lsp)
 (use-package lsp-haskell :ensure t :defer t )
 (use-package lsp-pyright :ensure t :hook (python-mode . (lambda () (require 'lsp-pyright) (lsp-deferred)))) ; or lsp-deferred)
 ```
 I used ghcup to install ghc and hls on my system (linux). Running haskell-language-server-wrapper on the shell works. 
 However, when I run lsp on haskell code in emacs I keep getting the following issue 
 ``` LSP :: The following servers support current file but do not have automatic installation: lsp-haskell You may find the installation instructions at https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages. (If you have already installed the server check lsp-log).
 ```
 Looking at lsp-log : ```Command "home/.ghcup/hls/1.7.0.0/bin/haskell-language-server-wrapper --lsp -d -l /tmp/hls.log" is not present on the path. Command "home/.ghcup/hls/1.7.0.0/bin/haskell-language-server-wrapper --lsp -d -l /tmp/hls.log" is not present on the path.
 ```
 Thanks in advance for your time and help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, just wondering if anyone has worked on any solutions to integrate some git commit message linting tools within magit.
 Can setup tools like Commitlint to add hooks that will reject a commit message if it is invalid, but if you format a commit message incorrectly it simply closes the commit buffer and returns to git status, meaning you have to retype out your commit message, which is obviously less than ideal.
 ​
 Has anyone looked at something like this before or have any suggestions about how to address this?
 Another potential solution is to possibly use a custom commit command that will open a shell in emacs and run something like cz-cli to create commit messages that adhere to things like the conventional commits format. 
 My search has yielded little results, so just wanted to ask others for anything I might be missing or some hints before I maybe start looking at implementing stuff myself :)

The goal of the project was to improve Nix onboarding and documentation experience to increase community growth by writing “The Nix Book”.

 (lsp +eglot +peek) 
 Basically, I've installed lsp-mode and eglot at the same time. The reason is that eglot works over TRAMP, while lsp-mode not. Also, I use a lot lsp-ltex and it depends directly of lsp-mode
 My question is: how could I disable eglot when using my local files and let that lsp-mode takes charge of everything, BUT reverse the roles when I'm in a remote file over TRAMP and shutdown lsp-mode and make eglot the lsp manager?
 Is it so hard to do or not? 
 Thanks.

It asks for permissions. I pressed allow. It just shows " Something went wrong there. Try again". What should I do. Is there any other way to do this? Please link resources. If I am missing any info let me know please.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been studying definitional interpreters written in Haskell as part of a programming languages course. We talked about writing in monadic style as an elegant way to implement non-determinism or exceptions or precise evaluation order. This got me wondering, is there a way to design an applicative interpreter which uses applicative functors as its interface?
 If this is possible, I could imagine a new design space. Since every monad gives rise to an applicative, there would be a broad range of applicatives to consider. Applicatives are also simpler to reason with, which could make the resulting languages more accessible for proofs.
 So far, I'm not sure that this is possible. Local 'let' definitions and lambda abstractions seem to require the full power of monads.

 With thanks for the assistance of this sub, I'm up and running with org-roam v2 after a hiatus from org-roam (v1). I've followed the System Crafters tutorial.
 I have an aesthetic issue the backlinks in my roam buffer are ugly (showing the full link in square brackets):
 ``` Backlinks (1) System Crafters (Top) They sometimes make videos about [[id:8ccffdbb-45c9-4826-b66a-182c085f6da7][programming languages]] like
 [[id:6f63cb5a-2866-4746-8f7d-2e14241afed9][Emacs Lisp]] and [[id:d16ab718-9d9a-4142-befd-6ef51dbe6224][Scheme]]
 ```
 It seems from a Github issue that this may be because of org-descriptive-links, but I'm struggling to find information on that. It's not in the Org manual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/haskell community!
 For the context, in case you haven't seen my posts before: SimpleX Chat is the first messaging platform that has no user identifiers, not even random numbers The messages are e2e encrypted, and the servers and network observers cannot see users' contacts or groups. You can use the servers pre-configured in the apps or host your own.
 What's new in v4:
  
local database encryption with passphrase. It's using SQLCipher as a replacement of SQLite, via our forks of direct-sqlite/sqlite-simple, it worked very well on all platforms - iOS, Android, Linux, Mac, we only didn't manage to compile encryption for Windows yet.
 improved stability of chat groups, file transfers and message delivery.
 you can now use your own WebRTC ICE servers for audio-video calls.
 German language in the interface.
  
See full release announcement for more details.
 Download the apps via the links in our GitHub repo: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#readme.
 Please ask any questions
 You comments, questions and criticism here are very welcome - I will try to answer all the questions!
 Also, we are hosting the event on Discord on October 6, at 6pm UK / 10am PT - please join via this link to:
  
learn how SimpleX Chat is different and why it provides better meta-data privacy than alternatives,
 hear about future platform development plans,
 ask any questions,
 criticize what we do,
 suggest improvements.
  
Once you install the app you can choose "Connect to developers" to ask any questions, suggest new features and to join the group of users.
 About SimpleX Platform
 Some links to answer the most common questions:
 How can SimpleX deliver messages without user identifiers.
 What are the risks to have identifiers assigned to the users.
 Technical details and limitations.
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc..

 I'm trying to figure out how to bind Ctrl-n and Ctrl-p in an evil-mode key map but I'm not sure sure which one is most correct:
 (define-key evil-<?>-state-map (kbd "C-n") #'evil-next-visual-line) (define-key evil-<?>-state-map (kbd "C-p") #'evil-previous-visual-line) 
 First, am I setting myself up for some sort of problems with evil-mode and thus this is a bad idea? If not, does anyone know what would be the appropriate map?
 I appreciate any input from folks who are evil-mode users. Thx.
 EDIT: evil-normal-state-map perhaps?

Claudius hastily married King Hamlet’s widow, Gertrude, Hamlet’s mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouring Norway, in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras’s infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king’s son, Prince Fortinbras, is imminent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 After installing Emacs from package, my logs are full of warnings such as:
 Warning (comp): c: /tools/emacs/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/org/org-entities.el: Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Warning (comp): C: \\ ProgramData \\ chocolatey \\ lib \\ mingw \\ tools \\ install \\ mingw64 \\ bin \\ libgccjit-0.dll: error: error invoking gcc driver 
 I noticed that the problem is that emacs uses "global" gcc (installed by chocolatey) instead of the local gcc embedded in the installation directory. I don't have and don't need all emacs dependencies in my mingw main directories. Is it possible to somehow set the configuration so that it works only on "own" embedded compiler?
 So far, I have been able to work around the problem by removing mingw from the system env path, I write mainly in python and golang, but if I need it again, the problem will come back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The utility of uniqueness typing - as evidenced by it being separately adopted by Clean and Mercury, as well as having echoes in Rust - is straightforward: it enforces a typing discipline that ensures values only have a single reference. (or none, in the case of Rust) Hence, using them to model side-effecting sequential code is straightforward, as destructive update and imperative control in uniquely-typed code can't pollute what's outside.
 Linear types are more elegant and intuitive from an abstract perspective, but weaken that guarantee : a linear arrow in Haskell can mint a linear value out of an immutable "plain" value with multiple references. Hence, although no more references may be added once it's been created, in-place destructive update isn't guaranteed to be safe.
 All is not lost, though: as linear types can only be used once anyways, it would, for practical purposes, suffice to show that they are eventually unique - that, by the time of their use/destruction, they only have a single reference. One could also consider a sequence of linear arrow applications, such that it converges to uniqueness in the given reference to which they were applied.
 Are there meaningful assumptions which strengthen linearity to uniqueness without dropping the theoretical cleanness? (like wrapping them in an opaque monad)

 If I just disable it works:

 Should it be like that? Or am I missing something?
 I'm a bit of a noob here, so any help is appreciated. Thanks

 UPDATE:
 I found out that the issue lies with python's jedi-language-server. If I use pyright this doesn't happen. It also works in elisp buffers, so that gave away that somehow jedi isn't working properly.
 For now, I'm going to be using pyright. One question though - is there a way to run several checkers at the same time? For instance, I would like to run flake8, pyright AND mypy.

 I'm a bit rusty on Nix so would love some help here :pray:
 Almost totally fresh M1 Pro Macbook Pro, just installed Nix and home-manager. I'm following the channel 22.05. Installed `ghc` fine, so I have 9.0.2, but when trying to install `haskell-language-server`, I get a segfault (exit code 139) when building Fourmolu which is a dependency. I get the same when trying to install Agda. Both happen whether through home-manager or not, and also whether from nixpkgs-unstable or 22.05. I suspect it's because Nix is for some reason using a really old version of clang (11) when it should be 13+ for M1s I believe.
 I can't believe I couldn't find this error anywhere no matter how…]]></summary>

 We've been writing Haskell for about 8 years now - both helping clients and building our own commercial products. We're a "little a agile" shop and we embrace https://www.simplehaskell.org/ 
 We're also actively involved in the community via the Haskell Foundation.
 We do some project work for clients and we build own products. Each of those teams could use more people right now so we're not hiring for a specific one - we'll discuss that in the interview process.
 While we'd be happy to hire senior people we aren't limiting ourselves to that for this current round of hiring. If you're interested then let's chat!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I have recently started taking denote notes in org format, using code snippets where appropriate. 
 Ever since I started considering to build a personal blog out of these notes using lazyblorg, the capacity to export an org file to html has risen in importance. This was also the context in which I realized an org-babel/source block behaviour that I don't understand.
 Frequently, when I want to quickly test how a note looks in html, I run into the error "unmatched bracket or quote" which aborts the html export.
 Now, I've started to narrow the initial problem down to a few problematic aspects: apparently, org-babel tries to match "<>" and "' '", both of which I generally used. However, since the lisp-babel-block doesn't use any of those signs as delimiters, why can't I use them? 
 Find below a block of things that I'd like to, but can't, use:
 #+BEGIN_SRC lisp (defvar *my-list* '(a b c)) ; This doesn't work because of ' (second *my-list*) ;; => b ; This doesn't work because of > (mapcar #'list *my-list*) ; This doesn't work because of ' #+END_SRC 
 Now that I think of it, I also can't use either of these in regular text, which is pretty annoying. I would like to be able to use #' since it is something I'd want to explain to myself using a note.
 Is there a way that I can modify this behaviour?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just curious: If you've played around with several FP languages (especially typed), how do you think Scala compares with them? What is similar and what is different? 
 Some context: 
 I've been on a programming language exploration journey for the last year or so and I'm trying to learn as many FP languages as I can. I've looked into Haskell, the various Lisps/Schemes, F#, Ocaml, Elm, Rust, etc.... Racket (a Scheme) and the ML-based languages (F#, Ocaml) have been my favorites so far, though they're also not without their weaknesses. Racket and OCaml are both fantastic languages (I found myself favoring the latter due to the type system), but kinda suffer from having a relatively small ecosystem -- and in the case of Ocaml, rather poor tooling. F# offers a much better ecosystem, and in fact it's the language I've used the most (I love ADTs). There's also something very elegant about the ML syntax, even though F# lacks some of the more interesting features of OCaml. One non-trivial weakness of F#, imo, is that eventually you're going to have to resort to some (or sometimes a lot) non-FP/OOP code due to its ties with the C# and the .NET environment. And that can be a drag.
 I've also tried a little Clojure, and it's a nice enough language (happy not to have to deal with Java), though I can't say that I'm in love with it. Overall, it just seems like a less elegant Scheme, and I don't see much of a reason to use it over something like Racket/Scheme, except for maybe the larger collection of libraries that are available on the JVM (OK, the hot reloading feature is also neat, but not something I necessarily care about).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thank you for this amazing sub.
 I have a question on how to better make tests. I am still very new to Haskell and there are a lot of newbie things I still haven't grasped so please bear with me.
 Say I have a data type that represents an expression in a abstract syntax tree.
 ​
 data Express = Bin String Express Express | BoolLit Bool | NumLit Int | StrinLit String | Unita String Express 
 Now I could do something like
 import qualified Generic.Random as GR instance Arbitrary Express where 
 arbitrary = GR.genericArbitrary GR.uniform
 But then I will get a ton of examples that I don't care to check for.
 For example:
  Binary "+" (NumLit 3) (BoolLit True) 
 Ideally I would want to generate an arbitrary that only produces valid examples.
 I get this is where I have to do some work.
 I played around with 
 ​
 instance Arbitrary Express where arbitrary = sized exprArb where exprArb s = do frequency [ (1, do num <- arbitrary return $ (NumLit num) ), (1, do expr1 <- arbitrary expr2 <- arbitrary str <- vectorOf 1 $ Test.QuickCheck.elements ['+', '-', '*', '/'] return $ Bin str expr1 expr2 ........ 
 The issue with the above is now I am manually making this to only be `Bin` and `NumLit`
 ​
 I think the solution would be to make an type/alias for only Bin/NumLit, Bin/StringLit, Bin/Bool.
 Then make a `GR.genericArbitrary GR.uniform` out of those.
 ​
 Not sure how to do that. Or if that is even the right way.
 What is the best way to leverage QuickCheck to test this without changing `data Express` ?

The ability to change the functionality of the editor, and to fit your editor to your workflow rather than the other way around is amazing. But I've never really been fully in Emacs. There are certain tasks that I do in a web browser or in a separate tool, like email or image editing, etc. For some of these, one could easily argue that Emacs isn't an appropriate tool (image editing). However, there are other features that Emacs has that don't replace functionality I already have, but rather, augment your workflow with something entirely new. And I will admit, I most definitely have not explored those as thoroughly as I perhaps should have.
 One of those long-untouched features is `org-mode`. I've tried to use it on many occ…]]></summary>

 I think I have followed one-too-many tutorials, and ended up with a non-working config, because my roam buffer doesn't show backlinks. I'm creating notes using org-roam-node-find or links SPC m l l or both.
 My buffer just shows one "backlink" which is persistent no matter which file I visit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've put together the first release (0.0.1) for echopraxia-plusakka, a structured logging module that adds structured logging mapping for Akka components -- Actor(Ref|Path|System|Context) etc -- and also adds some type enrichment and utility classes to expose loggers intuitively.
 https://github.com/tersesystems/echopraxia-plusakka
 Note that this doesn't go through LoggingAdapter, Akka's internal logging pipeline. Everything run through LoggingAdapter was processed into a String, so you couldn't represent data in two different formats depending on the appender -- in Echopraxia, argument serialization is deferred, so you can have logfmt on console and JSON on the backend. 
 This also means you don't have to rely on MDC or the built-in toString methods in Akka any more. Probably the biggest relief is being able to map ByteString to {length=11 utf8String=some string} so it has binary/text data available.
 Your domain messages in Akka can be handled using automatic derivation, and logging is type safe -- if there's no ToValue mapping, the logging statement just won't compile.
 Hope you like it!
 (Comments about Akka's business license / future are not welcome, please keep it on topic.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am a newbie in Haskell, but I want to use it to run some simulations for work.
 In particular, I am trying to write a function to compute the barycentric coordinates of a point and determine whether it is inside a triangle or not.
 Before anyone asks: it's not for rendering or game programming.
 I wrote the following code trying to translate my original C code:
 data Vec2D = Vec2D Double Double deriving (Show) data Triangle = Triangle Vec2D Vec2D Vec2D deriving(Show) v2c:: Vec2D -> (Double,Double) v2c (Vec2D x y) = (x,y) barycentric:: Vec2D -> Triangle -> (Double,Double,Double) barycentric (Vec2D xp yp) (Triangle a b c) = if db == 0 || dg == 0 then (-1,-1,-1) else (alpha,beta/db,gamma/dg) where (xp1,yp1) = v2c a (xp2,yp2) = v2c b (xp3,yp3) = v2c c dg = ((yp1 - yp2) * xp3 + (xp2 - xp1) * yp3 + xp1 * yp2 - xp2 * yp1) db = ((yp1 - yp3) * xp2 + (xp3 - xp1) * yp2 + xp1 * yp3 - xp3 * yp1) gamma = ((yp1 - yp2) * xp + (xp2 - xp1) * yp + xp1 * yp2 - xp2 * yp1)/dg beta = ((yp1 - yp3) * xp + (xp3 - xp1) * yp + xp1 * yp3 - xp3 * yp1)/db alpha = 1 - beta - gamma 
 The code compiles and, from my tests, it seems to work.
 As per the subject of the post:
  
How can I improve it?
 is the division by dg and db ok in the "where block" or should I be worried about a "divide by 0" error?
 Is there a better way to do this without having such a big "where block"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got an environment variable called $HOST and it seems that Emacs doesn't read it early enough. It usually isn't available during the execution of init.el
 It s present in the environment frm which I run Emacs.
 (getenv "HOST") returns a blank and it is annoying as my custom-file includes the USER and HOST variables so I can use the same configuration on different systems without clobbering the custom.el.
 Once Emacs fully loads it is available and (getenv "HOST") works fine.
 Is there some reason Emacs behaves this way for this particular variable?
 SOLVED
 I checked my .profile and realized that in this instance the config file which creates the HOST variable was not being source'd, so I've fixed it in this instance.
 The problem dates back some years ago when the default Debian environment was not creating a variable I needed so I had to add
 export HOST=$(hostname)
 to my .profile to ensure it would be available to GUI programs.

 I'm starting with early-init.el, and may add my own modules later, but I'm worried that when I update doom from the repo some of my settings will be overwritten.
 The logical thing to do it seems is to create my own branch of the original clone and make my own changes there. Then when I want to upgrade, I switch to the original master, pull the new changes, and cherry-pick the parts I need that don't conflict with my changes etc, but my git-fu is weak.
 Any experiences or advice in that respect? Are there some things to do or avoid that will make things easier?
 PS. I am also on the master branch which says 3.0.0-pre although the latest stable tag 2.0.9. Does that make much of a difference?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning! ☀️
 We're kicking off this week with new releases for both Indigo (Scala.js Game Engine) and Tyrian (Scala.js Elm-like Web Framework).
 It's been a while since we last pushed out new versions, but we're still working hard on both projects! The libraries are increasingly stable and we're having as much fun working with them as on them these days. 😊
 Indigo 0.14.0
 This release includes many improvements, fixes, and enhancements, but the exciting new feature is timeline animations!
 Even simple animations for title screens used to be very difficult in Indigo, but they now have a dedicated and rather fun solution.
 Release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.14.0
 (As a bonus, the Roguelike-starterkit has also had a tiny update to keep it inline with Indigo.)
 Tyrian 0.6.0
 Version 0.5.0 rebuilt Tyrian to run on Cats Effect 3 and fs2 from the ground up, but you were locked into using IO, and you couldn't use fs2 directly in your web apps. This release adds...
  
The ability to use fs2 Streams for subscriptions
 Support for ZIO 2.0*
  
We've also added a swathe of other quality-of-life improvements.
 Release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.6.0
 (\ You'll need to use a snapshot of the interop-cats library until the next release, but it works just fine. See the release notes.)*
 Getting Started
 You can get started with either project with their g8 templates:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian.g8
 ...or by heading over to the awesome: https://scribble.ninja/
 Documentation can be found at https://indigoengine.io/ and https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/.
 As always, please report any issues, and if you need any help, do come and say hello on Discord.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I use the IPython interpreter within Emacs the `In [number]` prompt numbers are not always sequential. Several numbers can be skipped from one prompt to the next. It tends to occur when sending a python buffer to the interpreter or executing a script from within the interpreter buffer. This does not happen with using the same interpreter within a terminal. Is this the case for others or just me so an issue with my configuration? Is it because Emacs is doing something under the hood which is 'using up' the prompts? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 Some experience with org mode, trying to bend code blocks to my will.
 Trying to use org to pass a json file into python script while developing it. I really would like to keep the json highlighting that org-mode provides. 
 If I were doing it in bash I might create the file as bash cat > /tmp/args.json <<HERE { "JSON_HERE": "Here is some JSON" } HERE 
 The python script will be written from a template and expects input from a file. If invoked at the command line, the command is python library/my\_test.py /tmp/args.json
 For the JSON part, I have JSON set up as an org-mode language language and that provides syntax highlighting and pop-out editing, but of course there is nothing to execute. An example block would almost do it, but there is no simple way to save that to a file AFAIK
 For the python part, there is lots of information in the manual as to how to pass in various elisp list, tables, properties etc but all I need is a simple file name. Any ideas how to do that without changing my code?
 Apologies if these are dumb questions.
 Cheers 
 Steven.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've stumbled upon this post by Jim Nielsen:
https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/markdown-sans-front-matter/
It describes how he went from Markdown files with metadata as YAML frontmatter:
---
title: My Blog Post
tags:
  - html
  - css
---

Start my blog post here.

... to just Markdown:
#html #css

# My Blog Post

Start my blog post here.

Jim's trick is to put the "slug" (i.e. the unique identifier that determines the URL of the published piece, which in the case of example.com/posts/my-amazing-post/ is the my-amazing-post part) into the filename. His filenames are of the format <YYYY-MM-DD>-<url-slug>.md, so starting with an ISO date, then the URL "path".
Making blogging simpler this way reminds me of how the way Sascha's and my Zettel format changed over the years, and how Sascha's very minimal solution eventually came about and sticks around since then:
# <ID> <TITLE>
<tags>

<content>

Very similar approach: make it pleasant for the human, let the app do the work. Avoid ceremony and technobabble.
I'd argue that Jim Nielsen's approach of putting hashtags before the title can worsen interoperability with applications that treat the first line of a file as the title -- but while that behavior is popular in a niche of plain text note-taking apps, it never really became a mainstream expectation, so 🤷‍♂️]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not like to set internal-border-with to anything other than 0, because I don't want the mode-line to not extend across the entire frame. So I've been looking for ways of adding a bit of 'padding' to my frame. 
 Left and right it's straightforward: simple set the fringe to some suitable width. Top padding is less so. 
 I figured I could make use of the header-line for that, and this seemed like a good start:
 (setq header-line-format " ") 
 Now, I found having a whole blank line of padding a bit much (I know...), so I tried specifying the height property in the value of header-line-format directly: 
 (setq header-line-format (propertize " " 'face '(:height 80))) 
 But that doesn't make a difference unless the height property is greater than that of header-line. 
 The only way I've found to make the header-line take up less than the default line height is by messing with the height of header-line. Unfortunately, some modes make use of the header-line for displaying stuff, so I find myself having to add hooks to every mode I encounter that does make use of the header-line, e.g.
 (defun my/reset-header-line-face () (face-remap-add-relative 'header-line '(:height 180))) (add-hook 'use-package-statistics-mode-hook 'my/reset-header-line-face) 
 Does anyone know or can think of a less ad-hoc solution?

 This only happens with Haskell which is weird.
 Also it's always saying "GHCup is not installed" when I clearly have it installed, can this be the problem?
 I am using EndeavourOS (basically Arch Linux) and my extensions are Haskell, Haskell HSX and Haskell Syntax Highlighting.
 In Windows 10 I have no problem using Haskell in VS Codium
 EDIT: Solved! I had to use the codium command to open VS Codium from the terminal. If you use normal VS Code just use code.This is not a direct fix to my issue but it's good enough for me, in the comments you can find the actual solution if you have patience to do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago i bought an expensive guitar. I played it for maybe 2 months and one of the strings started producing some ringing. The guitar came with a 5 year warranty. I took it to the shop, they tried to fix it but failed and offered me a new one. I readily accepted the exchange.
 A few months down the line even this guitar had some issues with ringing here and there. You'd be surprised to know that they again gave me a new one.
 Now, onto my third guitar. I started getting a bit better at playing by now (I had already been playing for years but didn't practice everyday until I invested in this guitar) and started understanding some technical details about the guitar, servicing it myself and also some just non technical things. I also saw the guitar Willie Nelson plays (it literally has a gouged hole in it and honestly most people who don't know it would chuck it in garbage).
 I realized that it's a guitar, it's made of wood and in a certain sense is alive. It's not going to be perfect but it's my Guitar. I know how to make it work. I practice on it everyday and I know how to manage those little details.
 You see where I'm going with this? I moved to Emacs a month ago. Objectively, it might be the worse choice compared to my setup on VSCode but it's my editor. Sure they'd be some jank and some small errors and bugs I can't fix but I can always service it myself. I can always make it better. I'd learn with it and grow with it.

I'm not a seasoned user and lack experience with the build tools, but seem to encounter these build issues more often than I would like to. For example I currently have this error. Ok, so one transitive dependency (diagrams-lib-1.4.5.3) that will not compile because of variable not in scope. I then try to lower the version bounds for dependencies that depend on diagrams-lib-1.4.5.3 in hopes that a lower version will not have this same issue:
 Chart >=1.8 && <1.10 , Chart-diagrams >=1.8 && <1.10 
 To:
 Chart >=1.7.0 && <1.8 , Chart-diagrams >=1.7.0 && <1.8 
 This causes another compilation error which I don't understand, as I have already tried various version bounds. So now I don't have any ideas left.
 Why would transitive dependency not compile, shouldn't this be solved by the dependency that uses it before being uploaded as a library for general usage?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a way to export an existing results block?
 Let's say I have this file:
 ``` * An example
 +begin_src sh :results output
 curl -I google.com
 +end_src
 ```
 I evaluate that src block, so now my file looks like:
 ``` * An example
 +begin_src sh :results output
 curl -I google.com
 +end_src
 +RESULTS:
 +begin_example
 HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Location: http://www.google.com/ Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Date: Sun, 25 Sep 2022 16:22:36 GMT Expires: Tue, 25 Oct 2022 16:22:36 GMT Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000 Server: gws Content-Length: 219 X-XSS-Protection: 0 X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
 +end_example
 ```
 But when I export (to Markdown as an example here, but all export backends seem to behave the same way), I don't get the results block:
 ```
 Table of Contents
  
 An example
  
<a id="org6ad066a"></a>
 An example
 curl -I google.com 
 ```
 I know about :exports both, but that re-evaluates the src block on export to generate a new results block, which I don't want. In my case, I need to capture results at a point in time--which I do by manually evaluating the src block in the buffer. I then want to be able to export those existing point-in-time results to other formats. Is there a way to do this? Am I missing something simple here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is a topic which has popped up a few times recently...
 I'm curious if anyone has any advice on annotating non-Org/Org Roam documents -- mostly PDFs -- in a way that allows the annotations to be integrated with Org/Org Roam? There has been some chatter here recently about forking + updating org-noter and I'm monitoring that situation.
 Are there other options out there?
 Is it worth considering the option of having some other tool host the annotations and hooking into that via .el? So, for instance, if Calibre supported annotation (it does not) would it be a better approach to include annotation support in calibredb.el?
 Thoughts? Opinions?
 FWIW, I've been doing a ton of research lately and it would be so nice to be able to pull non-Org stuff into the reach of the Org and Org Roam ecosystem in terms of linking, excerpts, and search.

But I did notice that Modalka defines fewer keymaps than Boon does. Modalka only provides two modes for editing and everything else, while Boon provides more modes.
 So I suspect that really what's happening is that they are managing keymaps. Is this actually true? Or am I missing something important?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started trying out nnreddit, a Reddit backend for GNUS. Out of the box, an refresh take around 3 minutes.
 I peeked into the source code of nnreddit and it seems that most of the time it spent is just accept-process-output. This should play well with cooperative threading. So out of curiosity, I tried
 (make-thread (lambda () (gnus-group-get-new-news)) "Gnus Get News") 
 Guess what -- it works! It does the work in the background without blocking emacs, and update the *Group* buffer once it's done.
 Surprisingly I didn't find anything similar online. I wonder have anyone experimented similiar techiques with more heavy usage? I have no idea how robust this is -- I could be very lucky with nnreddit, its source code has a bunch of with-mutex. I guess that suggests it's written with concurrency in mind? But it doesn't really use any concurrency out of the box, really puzzling...
 P.S. I know the workaround of running multiple Emacsen, but I don't really like it, because I would no longer have one single Lisp image where interoperation between applications is as simple as a function call, or hacking into each other's variables...

 ```
 +name: foo-overall
 +begin_src haskell :tangle foo.hs
 <<foo-a>> <<foo-b>>

 ```
 somewhere in my Org file and I have the definitions of these <<...>> noweb style references like this:
 ```
 +name: foo-a
 +begin_src haskell
 hello
 +end_src
 +name: foo-b
 +begin_src haskell
 world
 +end_src
 ```
 I would like to run org-html-export-to-html but make it so that:
  
each of the exported code blocks foo-a and foo-b link back to their location in foo-overall and
 foo-overall automatically links each of its <<foo-a>> and <<foo-b>> lines inside its code block to their respective definitions.
  
In other words, I would like these noweb style references to link to each other in both directions. This is so that after going to the definition of <<foo-a>> I want a link to click so that I can go back to the discussion for foo-overall and vice versa.
 AFAIK, #1 can be achieved by manually inserting Org refs (e.g. (ref:...) in the src block for foo-overall) as per https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html and then manually inserting a caption for the src blocks of <<foo-a>> and <<foo-b>>. However this is extremely tedious and is basically a deal-breaker for me.
 I've searched around for a solution for #2 and the closest thing I found was this comment. The script there just collects a list of all src blocks and inserts this list as a "References ..." note to every src block, which is too verbose. I see that there's a Stackoverflow question but it has gone unanswered.
 I can probably hack something together outside of elisp but was wondering if anyone had a similar desire to make noweb references automatically linked everywhere. Help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The default behaviour of org-store-link in an ordinary text file is to create a file: link with a search string, e.g. file:myfile.txt::Line 42. That doesn't suit me when creating links in certain cases so I added the following function to org-create-file-search-functions in order to instead get links like file:myfile.txt::42:
  (defun org-projectile-annotate-file-search-func () (when (and (projectile-project-p) (get-buffer-window "project-annotations.org")) (number-to-string (line-number-at-pos)))) 
 That works as expected, but then I read this bit in the documentation of org-create-file-search-functions
  
A function in this hook may also use setq to set the variable description to provide a suggestion for the descriptive text to be used for this link when it gets inserted into an Org buffer with org-insert-link.
  
I thought that might give me a way to make the description of the link a bit nicer (currently the description is the same as the link itself). However, I can't get it to work.
 I changed the function to
  (defun org-projectile-annotate-file-search-func () (when (and (projectile-project-p) (get-buffer-window "project-annotations.org")) (setq description "foobar") (number-to-string (line-number-at-pos)))) 
 but the link's description did not change. I then read the code for org-store-link and found no reference to description, but I did find desc so I did a setq on desc instead. Still no change to the link description.
 What is it I'm missing here? Or maybe the documentation is wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I’ve been working with Python for 3 years and I begun to explore the idea of learning a new language. I have done some projects at work using PySpark and I thought that going full blown Spark (i.e. learning Scala) would be a sensible option.
 However, I have no previous knowledge of Java and people also tend to be slightly negative about the idea of learning Scala for Spark since PySpark does a very similar thing… or so they say.
 My current job is a mixture of Python + databases… with a little bit of big data.
 What are you thoughts?
 Many thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello all.
 I've recently been using exwm and it's comfy, I like and dislike it's quirks.
 I have one question: is there any advantage on running exwm with a normal emacs client vs running emacs --daemon -f exwm-enable? I have sx configured that it launches dbus-run-session emacs and it works fine. but now I do this:
 s6-rc -l /tmp/${USER}/s6-rc -u change emacs-exwm
 while ! [ -e /run/user/1000/emacs/server ]
 do
 continue
 done
 exec dbus-launch /usr/bin/emacsclient -c
 where the first line it's just a supervised emacs --fg-daemon f exwm-enable.
 with this approach I can control emacs via kdeconnect (emacsclient --eval '(blabla)'), but is there any disadvantage?
 TL;DR when using exwm, is it better to use emacs with or without server-mode?

 I've configured emacs to use lsp-mode for several languages e.g. haskell when visiting a .hs file, python for a .py file. 
 These all work as expected according to my configuration.
 What happens often to me though is:
  
Open up such a file 
 lsp-mode fires up and connects (correctly) to the appropriate language server.
 
Edit other files of the same kind - all use the same languages server instance. Happy. 👍🏼
 
Kill the buffers using lsp-mode and connected to the languages server, one by one over time. 
 Close emacsclient (emacs server continues running as it should)
 
Language server is also still running despite having no more clients connected.
 
 Is it possible to have lsp-mode kill the language server automatically when there are no more clients?

So, I've been writing linked notes for a few years now, and I've found some of the posts from this community to be particularly insightful, especially seeing behind-the-scenes of other people's processes. (I also adopted the idea of UIDs from this forum, which I use constantly).
While I've used my notes regularly for myself–during my work and for writing articles–I've never shared any of my notes directly. So, I recently decided to start posting some online straight from my editor – a place where I spend a decent part my day thinking and researching.
I always find it useful to see how other people record and connect their thinking, and I hope this might be interesting/helpful. I'll be adding to the collection on Twitter every couple of days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a function that exports all the tables in the subtree at point to a single CSV file. I tried to implement this by narrowing to the subtree at point and then applying org-table-map-tables:
 (defun sbr-org-export-subtree-tables () "Export the Org tables in subtree at point to TSV file." (interactive) (save-excursion (while (/= (org-current-level) 1) (org-up-heading-safe)) (let* ((table nil) (chapter (car (split-string (nth 4 (org-heading-components)) ":"))) (file (format "%s.csv" (replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" (downcase chapter))))) (org-narrow-to-subtree) (org-table-map-tables (lambda () (setq table (nconc table (cddr (org-table-to-lisp))))) t) (org-toggle-narrow-to-subtree) (with-temp-buffer (orgtbl-insert-elisp-table table) (beginning-of-buffer) (org-table-export file "orgtbl-to-tsv"))))) 
 I notice that this function is exporting all the tables in the buffer, not just the tables in the current subtree. It appears that org-table-map-tables is ignoring the narrowing of the buffer to the subtree. Is this a bug, or am I misunderstanding how org-table-map-tables is intended to be used?

 I uncommented Python and running doom doctor came up with some errors about some addons.
 > :lang python ! Couldn't find isort. Import sorting will not work. ! Couldn't find pipenv. pipenv support will not work. ! Couldn't find nosetests. Running tests through nose will not work. ! Couldn't find pytest. Running tests through pytest will not work. 
 I suspect running pip to install the necessary python and emacs packages will fix those.
 Until LSP and pyls are installed is Python support provided by flycheck or some package installed by default?
 A worry I have is to know if what Doom did used Python 2 or Python 3 as both are installed on my system. I also saw some pip messages and perhaps that also involves Python 2
 Is that something I need to worry about now, or can that be deferred till later?

To be specific. Haskell, Python, and Java. Python and Java I have no problem with. But for some reason, I cannot wrap my head around Haskell. I have tried everything. This class is a requirement for my degree and only one person teaches it. I've done well in my other classes and am familiar with a lot of other languages and I feel like I am about to throw tens of thousands of dollars away on a degree because I am struggling with one niche language that I never want to use again. I passed all the hard classes in my degree and my entire education hangs on this. No offense to people who love Haskell. I understand it can be a great language in certain uses. Anyone who was like a lost puppy when they started learning Haskell, what resources did you use? My degree, financial well-being, and mental health depend on it. Haskell is worth about 25% of the overall course grade and I already bombed the first assignment. Unfortunately, her questions are very hard and the homework is very strict on using resources and other people.
 She low key expects us to be fluent in haskell in just five weeks.
 I hope this post is okay here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that I have tamed end of line comments to line up with proportional fonts (using the display attribute :halign-to, which lets you make text display at a particular physical column), I'm wondering if I might be able to do the same for c++ lines which are indented because of being continuations of a statement for a previous line.
 This isn't such a big deal as the comment thing was, as it only affects continued lines, and looks OK anyway the way it is. But it would be nice - normally emacs will line things like an argument on a continuation line with the enclosing parenthesis from the function call, but with a proportional font it only ends up approximating that.
 ​
 It seems like what I would have to do, is in the code that calculates what character from the line above to line this line up with, calculate the physical position of that character and add the spaces, but also visually indent the next line using :halign-to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I opened up VS Code for the first time in a long time. There was a file I wanted to edit outside of my normal project, and sometimes I like a separate editor for that so it's not polluting all the buffer lists and whatnot I have open.
 I saw that the clangd integration was available, so I turned it on, and I opened one of my normal project files.
 Why is clangd integration in VSCode so much faster and less painless? It came up with completions right away. I didn't have huge stalls while I waited for things to happen?
 I can only guess that something is weird with my setup, so I have to get rid of everything and start over, I think. I'll start with basically nothing except keybindings and eglot and p4.el and see if it's any better, because right now this is insupportable. The clangd integration in VSCode is faster than any code completion in Visual Studio or Jetbrains Rider, even with indexing turned on. I'd thought my stalls were because of clangd itself, and the absurd number of files it had indexed, but it's really not. I don't get symbol lookout timeouts in VS Code. There's something else afoot.

 For experimentation purposes I would like to compile lucid-emacs for alpine.
 I can't even find the lucid-emacs source code if such a thing exists. The github mirror for emacs is here.
 The original GNU emacs repo is here.
 I have found this page for emacs-lucid here which I am not so sure.
 So to sum up:
  
Does emacs-lucid have its own repo?
 Is it possible to compile it for alpine?

 To make my use of Mu4e an even better experience, I would love to combine for autocompletion the mail-addresses of org-contacts with the automatically collected mail-adresses of the mu database. I am using helm and tried out John Kitchins solution from https://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/03/14/A-helm-mu4e-contact-selector/, but if I (require 'org-contacts), the variable mu4e~contacts-for-completion is void, and if I do not (require 'org-contacts), I get the error: Symbonl's function definition is void: org-contacts-db.
 Does anyone of you combine the two sources for e-mail-address completion in mu4e, and how have you solved it?
 I was setting hopes in mu4e-contacts (https://gitlab.com/voidyourwarranty/mu4e-contacts). Regrettably, when I add the package and restart emacs, I get (error Recursive ‘require’ for feature ‘mu4e’).
 Thank you for any help and insights!
 I am using mu4e 1.8.9 and the newest version of org-contacts (that is on melpa again, yeah!).

How and why I got started with Haskell by Shayne Czyzewski
I decided I’d start learning it on the side and also look for a company that uses it as my next gig. That’s how my Haskell journey started, and how I got into Wasp a few months later.
Memoization via Representables by Iago Leal de Freitas
What is the most basic container type a language can have? Some people may answer vectors, others would go with hash tables, but in this post I am arguing in favor of functions.

 I've got an application that appears to get slower over time. I currently have no idea why. Ram usage seems constant, CPU usage seems low. But after a while, requests to the API take longer and longer.
 The problem is that I have no idea how to start working out where the performance issues are. It can take days before the problem sets in.
 Are there any good ways of getting to the bottom of this? Any tricks to facilitate debugging? I know that the RTS can spit out all sorts of logs, but I have no idea about interpreting them, or even if it's a good idea to log for days before stopping.
 So is there any good guides/tools for tackling this kind of problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellows,
 I am a recent denote convert and love it. It is an enriching expierience to have the ability to link notes to another (I have not used org-roam or exhausted hyperbole's capabilities). In my current workflow, I have bound org-store-link within my denote straight-use-package declaration because that's where I define other denote-related key-bindings and org-store-link has a denote: interface.
 When using that within a note created by denote itself, it works like a charm: I can just use the denote: type of link, a minibuffer selection is opened that shows the contents of my denote-directory.
 I tried to do the same in my todos.org file: org-store-link, denote: to link to a specific note. That did not work. After choosing the denote: type, I would have to manually enter the denote id, without completion and without minibuffer selection.
 I have no clue why that happens. Do you have an idea or a solution to this?
 Thanks a bunch, have a good day :)

 There are two things:
  
#1 ssh into Head Node. The cluster has login node but then I have to queue up for a node to do a big run. Then, I have to ssh into the (non-login) head node once slurm runs that. So, can I do this 'double ssh' using emac's gdb?
  load modules. gdb is on the cluster but a module needs to be loaded.
  
Is all this possible? It seems non trivial to do

 the Thompson book makes heavy use of GHCi. I do all my studying on my galaxy tab s6 lite tablet, so I don't have to lug around a laptop to the library and coffeeshops.
 is it possible to install ghci (including writing module files and loading them) on my android tablet? a quick Google search on this subreddit and Google, of [ghci Android], makes me think that I can't?

 Library for incremental dataflows in emacs. This library let's you construct dataflow graphs called data frames, i.e., computations on collections that can be evaluated lazily (on demand) and whose results can be materialized. The materialized versions can then be incrementally maintained, i.e., you provide inserts and deletions for the data sources processed by a dataflow graph and idf will update the results of the dataflow based on the changes to the input data sources (what elements got inserted and deleted from the data sources).
 The rationale is that is you have some large sorted list or hashtable that is the result of a non-trivial computation, it is faster to incrementally maintain the datastructure using idf if there are only small changes to t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm currently writing a rewrite rule system for an eDSL. Here is a very simplified version:
 data Expre = A | B | X Expre Expre process :: Expre -> Expre process A = B process B = A process (X ex1 ex2) = X (process ex1) (process ex2) 
 Expre pretty much represents a tree with two leaf constructors.
 process has my rewrite rules for terms of type Expre. All it does is swap A and B around. I was wondering if there is a canonical, clean way to track each application of a rewrite rule? So, concretely tracking the changes of my expression: process $ X A (X B A) should spit out the following list of intermediate terms:
 1 X B (X B A) 2 X B (X A A) 1 X B (X A B) 
 The number in the front represents which rewrite rule was applied. This feels very much like a problem that has a generic solution using a typeclass/data structure/idea that I'm not aware of, so I was wondering if such a thing exists. 
 My handrolled solution looks like this, there has to be a neater way:
 process :: (Expre -> Expre) -> Expre -> Writer [(Int, Expre)] Expre process fn A = tell [(1, fn B)] >> return B process fn B = tell [(2, fn A)] >> return A process fn (X ex1 ex2) = do e1 <- process (\e -> fn $ X e ex2) ex1 e2 <- process (\e -> fn $ X e1 e) ex2 return $ X e1 e2 
 Called with runWriter $ process id $ X A (X B A) in GHC gives the desired result.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody! I'm really having a hard time trying to decide whether to learn vim or emacs. I'm not here to ask for suggestion or any kind of comparison between the two, don't worry. What I'd like to know is whether org-mode could be useful for a specific use case, which could make me lean towards doom emacs rather than neovim.
 From time to time I have to write documentation for software packages at work. While doing so, we like to have both a pdf version (using latex) to hand to our customers and an html (or similar) version to be stored inside the git repository of the project. To avoid having to write two different docs, we initially used markdown and a custom pandoc filter (for headings, frontpages and whatnot). The problem is that this approach is very limiting when it comes to cross-referencing, captions, and tables with cells spanning multiple columns or rows. Hence we switched to RMarkdown, but having to write R code for the sole purpose of properly handling a few images and tables is very frustrating.
 Do you think that org-mode could be used to solve the problem once and for all? I know that tables in org-mode are pretty powerful, but I don't know to which extent. Nor if the same syntax would be correctly translated both in latex and html as it is with simpler tables.
 Also, if any of you uses org-mode to write scientific papers (hence using different latex templates from different journals) in the STEMs, I'd like to hear your impressions.

 / It's a bit weird, because this is how it's recommended in the wiki: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsClient Maybe a problem with zsh? // yup looks like it, because this works in bash.

It works fine for the most part but I need to change a few things in the initializationOptions. You can click on the link to see the documentation I am talking about. 
 VSCode (probably) sets some options automatically and I'm trying to get my development environment almost the same as the one I had with VSCode. I just cannot figure out how to pass these configs when the server starts.

 I'm a newb with emacs and org mode. I've been trying to get something into the agenda view with org-agenda-custom-commands and org-super-agenda-groups but been failing miserably :D
 What I want is pretty simple and I'm sure there's a solution this, but I wasn't able to find it.Basically, I want to list all TODO items under a certain heading. For instance:
 * Tasks ** TODO some stuff ** TODO some other stuff ** non todo stuff * Not tasks ** some non task stuff ** TODO Some todo, but not under Tasks heading 
 Now, what I would like to list in an agenda view is all TODO items under the "Tasks" heading, but not under the "Not tasks" heading. After running the custom command, it should be like this:
 ** TODO some stuff ** TODO some other stuff 
 I've been trying to get this to work with the search command, but could not get this to work. I'm a bit at a loss right now, so any help, would be really appreciated :)

 VSCode has LSP support using terraform-ls (the Hashicorp one), and it works decently, but I'm finding it hard to get used to VSCode's UX.
 My assumption with LSP is that all heavy lifting should be done by the language server. Why does Eglot + terraform-ls not work as well as VSCode's implementation? Not even some basic auto-completion. Anyone managed to get it working?

 ​
 I am working remotely on a supercomputing cluster, running Emacs on my machine, and using TRAMP to edit python files on the cluster.
 To my great surprise, this works quite well, and the REPL also works flawlessly, as apparently run-python (C-c C-p) detects this is a remote file, and use the corresponding interpreter on the remote.
 ​
 However, I realized the version of Python running on the cluster is not the correct one. Indeed, they use the module utility to provide multiple conflicting version of programs. This means that I have to run module load python3 before executing python3 to make sure I have the latest version.
 ​
 If I SSH into the cluster, this is not a problem, as I just added the module load line in my .bashrc. However here, I am not sure how to do it: this is not an interactive shell, so the usual dotfiles are not read (.bashrc, .profile and friends).
 ​
 Any idea ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm currently trying to build a small package org-inline-block that aims to provide a simple syntax for blocks (without begin/end) based on indentation (like plain lists). While it would be cleaner to properly extend org-element for the export part, I only plan to add a function to 'org-export-filter-body-functions.
 Here comes the function (simplified version that isolates the problem):
 (defun org-latex-inline-block (text backend info) "Manage inline block in LaTeX export, as part of body." (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex) (let ((case-fold-search nil)) (replace-regexp-in-string "\\([ \t]*\\)\\(\\(Question\\)\\( (\\([^()]*\\))\\)?\\.\\)\\(\\(.*$\\)\\([\n]\\(\\1[\t ]+.*\\)?\\)*\\)" (lambda (substr) (format "\\begin{question}%s\\end{question}" (org-inline-block-get-core substr))) text nil t)))) 
 with
 (defun org-inline-block-get-core (s) "Given >Question. abcde<, return >abcde<" (let ((case-fold-search nil)) (string-match "Question\\( ([^()]*)\\)?\\. " s) (if (> (match-end 0) 0) (substring s (match-end 0)) ""))) 
 Here comes the unexpected behavior: if I try to export "Question. Where is Brian?", it will be exported to "\begin{question} Where is Brian? \end{question} Where is Brian? ", and I can't guess where this duplicate comes from... Any idea ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Is it possible to perform an AST re-write that depends on global knowledge derived from the AST while simultaneously evaluating the AST -- all in a single pass?
 The "Real" Problem:
 I'm working on a Haskell -> Elm code generator. I'm parsing out an Elm type AST (see below). The problem is that multiple TyDecl varname nodes could exist after parsing. E.g: the following haskell type definition
 data Foo = Foo Int | Bar [Foo] 
 generates
 TyDecl "Foo" [] ( TyVariant ( ( "Foo" , [ TyInt ] ) :| [ ( "Bar" , [ TyApp "List" [ TyDecl "Foo" [] (!!! Recursive def of Foo here !!!) ( TyApp "Foo" [] )] ] ) ] ) ) ( TyApp "Foo" [] ) 
 To solve this problem I am folding twice over the parsed AST.
 The first pass replaces all but one TyDecl "Foo" node with its TyApp "Foo" [] node. This is done by using an algebra
 preventDuplicats :: (MonadState (Set VarName) m) => Base Ty (m a) -> m a 
 Following the example above this rewrites the above AST to be:
 TyDecl "Foo" [] ( TyVariant ( ( "Foo" , [ TyInt ] ) :| [ ( "Bar" , [ TyApp "List" [ TyApp "Foo" [] ] ] ) ] ) ) ( TyApp "Foo" [] ) 
 The second pass evaluates the AST to generate the Elm code (essentially):
 generateElm :: Base Ty String -> String 
 What I'd like to do is construct some mechanism that would let me perform this AST re-write (preventDuplicates) while evaluating with the main algebra (generateElm). Maybe something like?:
 evalAndPrevent :: (MonadState (Set VarName) m, Comonad w) => (Base Ty (w a) -> a) -> Base Ty (w (m a)) -> m a 
 Ty Definition
 data Ty = TyVar VarName | TyApp VarName [Ty] -- This models `let` expressions in type declarations -- data B a b c = <a> in <b> == TyDecl "B" ["a","b","c"] <a> <b> | TyDecl VarName [VarName] Ty Ty | ... deriving (Show, Generic) 
 Attempted solutions?
 I've looked into prepomorphisms. However, this doesn't seem to work because the re-write morphism Base t a -> Base t a by defintion is a "local" only re-write.

 I like how lightweight org-super-links feels and the fact that the links are just standard or links that work in orgzly. Honestly I can't figure out what org-roam adds to the picture. That said there seems to be a bunch of hype about org-roam and feel like I must be missing something. 
 Honest question: can someone explain the attraction of org-roam over org-super-links? Is there something special about the org-roam-capture stuff that's different enough from org-capture to fill some gaps?

 UPDATE: my problem was that all the timestamps are inactive timestamps, which don't show up in org agenda view; active timestamps do.

Many FOSS projects use Akka in some way (Play Framework, Apache Flink, ...) and are therefore forced to lock the Akka version to the last Apache Licence 2.0 release or replace Akka. The additional use grant in the BSL license for the Play Framework is very limited and is no solution to move forward. 
 It would be the best for these FOSS projects to have a reliable Akka fork (focused on bug fixing and long term stability).
 Are there already ongoing initiatives for an Akka fork?
 Who would be willing to contribute to an Akka fork (financial contribution, development or organisational aspects)?
 How do we make this happen?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, I made a post about Okapi. Okapi is a micro web framework for Haskell. The feedback I got was great and I've made a lot of changes to Okapi since then. The core idea of Okapi is still the same: use monadic parsing to implement web servers.
 The biggest addition to Okapi since I last posted is the addition of named routes. One of the comments on my previous post asked if Okapi had named routes. At the time it didn't, but I think I've found a way to implement type safe named routes in Okapi without relying on Template Haskell or type-level programming like other Haskell web frameworks do.
 I've written a series of essays on the topic of named routes, and how they work in Okapi.
  
Named Routes in Okapi: Part I
 Named Routes in Okapi: Part II
 Named Routes in Okapi: Part III
  
Okapi is still in the early stages of development, so I'm looking for feedback. Any kind of feedback is appreciated. Whether it's the design of the documentation, code conventions, the names of functions, concerns, etc. Please don't hesitate.
 I'm really interested to hear what non-Haskell users and beginner Haskellers have to say. The blog posts I listed above are probably more geared toward advanced-beginner/intermediate Haskellers, but feel free to check out the hopefully more beginner friendly documentation listed below.
  
Official documentation
 Hackage candidate documentation
  
Documentation is still largely incomplete at this point, but I'm working on it. I want to get feedback on everything so far before going further.
 I can't recommend Okapi for production projects yet, but I've successfully been using it for small, long-running web applications of only a few users without any problems so far.
 Thank you for reading :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have heard that thrown around so many times that it was one of those sentences that didn't mean much anymore. Before I started using emacs I thought wtf does that even mean? I don't care what else it can do. I have everything else exactly how I want it, I just need a text editor. 
 For whatever reason, I made the switch from VSCode to Doom Emacs about 20 days ago. I knew vim keybindings and stuff already but I didn't use them on a day-to-day basis only on servers that didn't have anything else. I did pick up the evil keybindings quickly and after 2-3 days of installation and setup woes, my javascript editing environment was set up rather well. I started relying on vim-fu for code editing and it's so much more enjoyable (don't know if it's faster yet) than using a mouse. 
 That made me want more modal-based stuff, I wanted my browser to have modal navigation. While I'd never switch to the emacs browser I installed vimium on my chrome and it works rather well. Now, I started thinking it'd be so nice to have a file manager that was keyboard-focused and da-dum-tusss, the penny dropped. Dired, so that's what they mean when they say "Emacs is not just a text editor." 
 I'm in the process of installing mu4e now and I'm slowly beginning to understand things about Emacs that just cannot make sense to you unless you've spent some time with it. I know I heard people say that but I always thought of them as denial-filled ramblings of people who have sunk a decade into learning a tool that's slowly fading. Apparently, not the case at all.

 Authentication is fine, and the directory structure after my specified MAILDIR is created. 
 However, a temp file is not found (because, presumably, it is not created) and an error results.
 The various online guides guides and the Arch wiki don't mention this issue. So, I feel I'm missing something fundamental.

No matter what I try, (window-width) will return 70 and that only fits 61 characters. I'm a fan of short lines myself, but this is absurd; especially when most of the people I write with tend to add line-breaks at 70, so I get a bunch of lines with 10 characters or less following.
 So my question is naturally, how do I resize the window of a notmuch-show-buffer?

 I am happy emacs user 20++ years and I have been through many upgrades during the emacs usage. Just to mention that Fedora has been my main distribution ship, which provides the built-in emacs binaries. 
 In my latest upgrade attempt, the results were frustrating, from "emacs" point of view. The update was from Fedora 34 to Fedora 36 with exactly the same setup (gnome,wayland,nvidia driver, .emacs) , so it went from emacs 27.1 to GNU Emacs 28.1 (build 1, x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.34, cairo version 1.17.6) of 2022-07-15
 I removed the *.elc just to be sure and then the blinking "party" started.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title may be confusing so let me clarify. I often use a simple tool called sops made by Mozilla that is used to encrypt/decrypt yaml/json/text files with your gpg key. It works from the command line so if you invoke sops on and encrypted file it will decrypt it, open the decrypted version on a temp file (located in /tmp/<random-digits>) on your $EDITOR and then re-encrypt everything and delete the temp file once you close the $EDITOR.
 Currently I invoke sops on vterm which opens an new emacsclient instance where I edit my file. I thought wouldn't it be cool if emacs could auto recognize if a file is encrypted with sops and decrypt it on the same buffer. 
 Now the only thing I am having a hard time understanding is how you would go about redirecting sops to open a new buffer instead of whatever your $EDITOR is.

 Changes since v2.7.5:
 Behavior changes:
  
stack build --coverage will generate a unified coverage report, even if there is only one *.tix file, in case a package has tested the library of another package that has not tested its own library. See #5713
 stack --verbose no longer includes the lengthy raw snapshot layer (rsl) in the debug output by default. The new stack --[no-]rsl-in-log flag enables or disables the inclusion of the rsl in the debug output.
  
Other enhancements:
  
Bump to Hpack 0.35.0.
 On Windows, the installer now sets DisplayVersion in the registry, enabling tools like winget to properly read the version number.

 Another workflow I've been thinking capturing the webpage along with its meta-data and then taking a note on that page in an org file.

 For anyone who hasn't used it - it can preview completion while typing, pressing TAB can execute the completion or indent - based on the context.
  
While this works well sometimes I'd like to use completion besides dabbrev, configurable based on the context (editing code/comments/strings ... etc).
 Ideally there would be a way to use context sensitive compilation back-ends which I could write & register.
 At this point I'm considering writing my own package but thought there might be some solutions out there.
 Key features I'm looking for:
  
Preview completion while typing.
 Ability to define my own completion functions.
 Non-blocking interface, a single keystroke to accept and keep typing.
  
Does anything like this already exist?

 However, since I startet using spacebar
 https://github.com/cmacrae/spacebar
 ​
 I don't have the possibility to see this information unless I switch to the emacs window/space.
 Spacebar can display the shell output of some commands. For example, `which`.
 I wonder if I could somehow display the clocking information in spacebar by using some system command outside emacs.
 ​
 Any ideas?
 EDIT
 After applying the solution proposed by @tianshuwang, I could have what I need.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I've been writing some go code recently, and found that the eglot/company mode autocomplete performance is awful with large completion lists. Specifically, I'm running into issues when using tcell. Here's an example snippet to show what I mean:
 package main import ( "github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2" ) func main() { tcell.[cursor goes here - `completion-at-point`] } 
 If completion-at-point is run at the position noted above, emacs locks up for several seconds. Based on a profiler report I ran, the lock up appears to happen at common-lisp-indent-function, but I can't find any evidence online that this is an expensive or slow function... I'm a little bit at a loss at how to fix this. Ideally I'd like to just disable indenting around whatever's happening here (since it's happening somewhere deep in the json rpc call). Can anyone else reproduce this problem, or has anyone else seen it?
 Edit: figured I'd mention that this problem disappears with lsp-mode, so I guess I'll be using that for the time being.

 The latest docs are at https://scala-slick.org/doc/stable/.
 How to upgrade
 Upgrading should just be a matter of setting the version to 3.4.1 in your build files. (Or, give Scala Update a try.) However, see the upgrade guide in case any changes do affect you.
 What’s ahead
 Now that 3.4.1 has been released, the top priority is Scala 3 support, G-d willing. There is already a proof of concept by Stefan Zeiger (the original author of Slick), but there is still work to be done to ready it for consumption.
 After that is released, I would like to see Slick evolve freely. There are lots …]]></summary>

I do ASIC design so my code is mostly SystemVerilog with some Python, makefiles, and shell scripts. I don’t use git, either - instead a rare tool called SOS (https://www.cliosoft.com/products/sos/) designed to integrate with CAE tools. Therefore, lots of packages like company don’t easily work with our setup. Instead, I have Verilog compile lists of files and include directories for a project. 
 Does any know of any project packages that could easily take the compile list files and give us the great features I’m always reading about here? LSP would be amazing since my verification files import many SystemVerilog packages of functions and classes (similar to those in other languages). 
 Thanks much!

 If so, why the naming inconsistency? Legacy of an expansion to org-babel at some point?
 Is there a difference that's relevant outside of org-babel's code but largely irrelevant inside it?
 Are 'header arguments' supposed to be the keys and 'parameters' the values, respectively? And the way they're handled (eg. org-babel-params-from-properties) is just making me go cross-eyed about an otherwise simple relationship? Or no?
 I don't /see/ a clearcut difference, but I don't entirely trust my eyes when it comes to org's source and could use a sanity check.

 Main changes:
 - cathed and fixed two cases where the behavior of async versions of stdlib functions was different than in direct mode. 
 - Experimental loom support (should be enabled by flag), which supports two modes:
 -- hybrid, where we use cps-transform for async/await and Loom for restoring a form of transformed high-order function arguments. This is useful for the effect systems, were spawning a virtual thread in each interpreter step will still be heavy compared to a function call. 
 -- full, where we use loom instead cps-transform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lets say I want Calc to understand a TeX formula like $\int_a^b f(x) \mathrm{d} x$. Clearly, there are many ways to write this, I could have just written "d" instead of "\mathrm", the integral bounds could be just a single lower index indicating a region, "f(x)" could actually consist of derivatives with the same differential notation as "d x", etc. If I could use Backus-Naur form, I would define a non-terminal like
 INTEGRAL := "\\int" REGION INTEGRAND DIFFERENTIAL DUMMY_VAR
 and then individually handle all of these edge cases in each non-terminal. For instance, I could write REGION to accept empty patterns for indefinite integrals, or to accept just a subscript for regions, similarly for DIFFERENTIAL or INTEGRAND. Instead, in Calc, I have to write a messy rewrite rule to just handle the REGION part, and I am not even sure if the INTEGRAND symbol could be implemented since any integrand having terms that look like $\frac{d f}{d x}$ would prematurely terminate parsing as the denominator would be interpreted as DIFFERENTIAL. It seems to me that Calc is formally incapable of handling these complications, but I may be wrong. Are there ways within calc to implemen the functinality I want? If not, are there libraries that allow me to augment Calc in this way? Failing that, I would be willing to use the Wisent parser generator, but how do I integrate it into Calc?

 My use case is that if I add Chinese text for any reason, the fallback font Noto Sans CJK is slightly taller than my coding font Iosevka which causes every line to shift down.
 Before anyone suggests this, changing line spacing does not address my issue.
 Luckily I probably can work around this by compiling the font with additional vertical spacing myself, but I'd rather just not have to do that every time the font updates.

 If I am trying to use another class (from the same folder) in my main(), I get the error: "cannot be resolved to a type".
 So far I've tried setting a demo project with Gradle but I get the same error.
 If you can share your init.el I would be very grateful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've used Emacs for 30 years. You'll pry it out of my cold, dead hands. I've written plenty of elisp for it. Org-mode is a mystery to me though. Maybe I haven't run across the right tutorial, but my impression is that it is a fancy outline maker. Half of the positive things people say about Emacs seem to be about org-mode, but everyone seems to use it in different ways, for different things. Ironically, org-mode is daunting in its breadth the same way that Emacs itself must be for new users. Are there good resources that can explain the philosophy and applications of org-mode?

 If you've used outshine, it's inspired by and similar to that, but much simpler:
  
More focused: 1/30th the LOC
 Better default headline styling (IMO)
 Automatic and easy to configure headline prefix patterns, which can be different per mode
 Adds only one buffer-wide binding (Shift-Tab, for headline cycling)
 Close adherence to org speed-key bindings

 For the context, I'm trying to build a I'm an indent-based syntax for blocks: instead of having #+begin_theorem ... #+end_theorem , I would like to write Theorem. Lorem Ipsum ...and base export on indentation. But I'm a bit lost between the roles of electric-mode, indent-mode, fill-paragraph and all that stuff...
 ---
 EDIT: The cleanest way seems to extend org-element (as #'org-indent-line is looking for it when intending items), but how?

But I can't find any command (user-level or elisp) to access the HTML part of an email from within notmuch-show. I can store attachments, but the HTML part is not offered for saving. And looking at the code, notmuch seems to relay on mm-view and other stuff for which I could not find documentation. So, basically, my question is: what functions can I use to access the HTML part of a mail within the notmuch-show buffer so that I can pass it to a process?
 EDIT: 
 It's mm-dissect-buffer. When called wrapped within with-current-notmuch-show-messsage, you get a list of mm-handle objects defining the different parts of the mail viewed. To save the part, you can use mm-save-part-to-file. There is even a search function mm-find-part-by-type. 
 I'm down in the rabbit hole now! :)

 I don't care about how dangerous auto-updates are because I only use good packages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 To preface this post, I am currently using Emacs within the terminal within VSCode, since I hate LSP mode in terms of how damn hard it is to configure something that even compares to VSCode. Trust me, I've been through most configs and setups, and nothing 'just works' and is a complete mess.
 That being stated, I went ahead and thought to then just use Emacs in terminal anyway since I use it for Org Mode notes anyway for work and would rather use VS Code for web development projects with intellisense out of the box (React, vanilla JS, Ruby, etc).
 ​
 With This In Mind, I Have The Following Issues:
  
Issue Using 'M-x RET' to launch 'vterm' on MacOS
  
So on MacOS, I do the following key combo swaps:
 - Swap Caps with Ctrl
 - Swap Option with Command
 ​
 However, when I try to use my existing key combination on MacOS to launch 'vterm' with 'M-RET' that works already works on Linux (Manjaro), I get the following:
 M-RET is undefined 
 A related snippet from my config can be found here:
 https://bpa.st/XLNQ
 ​
  
Using 'M-w' quits out of VS Code 
  
Anyone who uses Emacs knows that 'M-w' is used to copy a selected portion of the buffer into the copy and paste clipboard.
 However, when I do this action, it quits out of VS Code.
 Does anyone know how I can nuke this default behavior of VS Code to allow Emacs to just utilize it going forward?
 ​
  
Using 'M-f' and 'M-b' does not go back and forward
  
When I use this in VS Code, 'M-f' brings up the 'Find' search bar.
 And 'M-b' toggles the ability to show and hide the Explorer window.
 How can I adjust this so that Emacs is given the ability to use 'M-f' and 'M-b' normally?
 ​
 Thanks!

I feel like it is simple. I understand how the Maybe function is defined but i am having the hardest time. 
 this is what i have currently but i have had many variations that feels the same, using let and in. i guess there is something missing that i am not understanding but ive been stumped on it. is this something where using a wildcard would be better? i do think using fromJust is the way to go.
 i had something working where it would return the value from the maybe value, but when the value was Nothing, it wouldnt return the default value given as it should. And since then i have gone through so many variations that i forgot what it was. 
 any help or suggestions is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having a rough go at making my bespoke modeline. It's gotten a lot better in performance but now I'm noticing a "creeping" performance leak.
 It's most noticeable when I tangle org files or open up my agenda. Both of these operations get progressively slower and slower until I have to wait several seconds just to have a look at my task list.
 I went into my config and commented out my modeline setup. Without even waiting for things to get worse I noticed these operations were way snappier.
 I've been told that:
  
Avoid doing evals in your modeline
 Avoid expensive functions if you are doing evals
  
I don't believe any of my function calls are expensive per-se. I am doing some weird stuff with cached git statuses and I may be rendering an SVG icon for god mode. I do have god-mode on by default.
 I'm guessing that somewhere in the background lurks a billion ever-exapanding buffers, temporary or otherwise, that are needing to eval their git project status and render an svg icon.
 Anyway, at this point I'd like to distill my modeline down into simple, colorized text. Maybe with a gap between left and right sides (already got this). I'd take any advice I can get.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently decided to give org-mode and org-babel a shot as a notebook (think jupyter). I have a cli program that takes two text files as input. Currently, I've put those text files in a #+begin_src text block, with a tangle. I then have a #+begin_src sh block taking two filenames as input variables that invoke the cli program with the filenames.
 The current workflow thus ends up being:
  
don't forget to tangle the input files
 invoke the shell block
  
Ideally I'd like to somehow configure it such that invoking the shell block will auto-tangle the input blocks, or something to that effect (if there's an option to put them in a temp file and present the filename to the sh block, that's also fine). Is this something that can be done somewhat straightforwardly?
 Secondly, currently I have the following tangle instructions on each input file: :tangle (org-in-tangle-dir "file.txt"). The filename to tangle to is identical to the #+name: file.txt preceding the block. The org-in-tangle-dir function is defined as follows:
 (defun org-in-tangle-dir (sub-path) "Expand the SUB-PATH into the directory given by the tangle-dir property if that property exists, else use the `default-directory'." (expand-file-name sub-path (or (org-entry-get (point) "tangle-dir" 'inherit) (default-directory)))) 
 Is there any way to tell the tangle to use the #+name attribute as filename to tangle to?
 Thanks for any help

 In Api.hs, I have a Servant api which takes a JSON request and puts it into the following type:
 data RegisterData = RegisterData { email :: Email } 
 I need RegisterData to have a Data.Aeson.FromJSON instance, which means Email needs one too.
 I have 3 choices:
  
Add the instance to User.hs. However, it seems wrong to me to add an implementation detail to the "pure" type; furthermore this wouldn't work if I were using types from an external library (such as UUID)
 
Add the instance into Api.hs; this compiles, but is an orphan instance
 
Have email in RegisterData by a Text instead, but this loses the type safety of the Email type.

 I tried to find a solution to this question on my own for quite a while now. I'm rather certain that I am also phrasing my problem the wrong way, because it is impossible that it is that hard to find.
 I want to write a function that opens my org agenda file(s) in buffer(s), operates on said buffer(s) and then saves them. More concretely, I want to have org-sort-entities sort my todos.org file every time I used org-capture (using org-capture-after-finalize-hook).
 I am grateful for both pointers and complete solutions. As I said, for some reason I can't wrap my head around the way emacs opens files when it doesn't happen upon my initiative.
 Have a good day, fellows :)
 SOLVED: I was able to solve the problem! Thanks a bunch, u/MitchellMarquez42 and u/EternalMigrainity!

 However, I read that one problem of Evil is that it can interfere with Emacs keybindings (perhaps only in some modes). Is there such a problem with Boon and Meow too?
 If you have experience with these packages, can you comment on why you picked one over the other? I am a Dvorak user, if that matters.

 I have a simple problem which I haven't found an elegant way to solve. How do I get deadlines (or anything else for that matter) in org-mode to react dynamically to the value of variables? for example:
 - I have 5 shirts in my office (which I visit infrequently), that is noted on my org-file:
 - shirts x5 
 When shirts x5 becomes shirts x2, I'd like something similar to the following task to be generated automatically:
 * Priority_projects ** Iron shirts and pack in work bag :home: SCHEDULED: <2022-09-17 Sat> 
 I've been having a play with tasker (on Android) and shell commands, and can grep lines into variables and then change things like tickboxes with sed. I'm finding dealign dynamically with the current date very tricky.
 There must be an easier way?

  (:prefix-map my-avy-map :prefix "C-j" :prefix-docstring "Counsel" ("j" . avy-goto-char) ("C-j" . avy-goto-char) ("g" . avy-goto-char-in-line) ("w" . avy-goto-word-1) ("e" . my-avy-copy-word) ("L" . my-avy-just-copy-line) ("l" . avy-goto-line)) :bind-keymap ("C-j" . my-avy-map) 
 I am just surprised this broke (nothing breaks on emacs usually :D) and I am not sure if it's still the right way

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been trying really hard to get C indentation correct, that is, the K&R style.
 I thought I got it right, but I found out that the default value of c-basic-offset was 5 on my Mac! It was fine on my Linux machine (running Manjaro) though. So I had to manually set it to 8, and now I'm quite happy with my setup.
 The following is the relevant config: ```lisp (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil) (setq-default tab-width 8) (setq backward-delete-char-untabify-method 'hungry)
 (setq-default c-default-style "k&r") (setq-default c-basic-offset 8) (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook (lambda () (setq indent-tabs-mode t))) (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'lsp)
 ;;(use-package smart-tabs-mode ;; :ensure t ;; :config ;; (smart-tabs-insinuate 'c))
 (setq whitespace-style '(face tabs tab-mark trailing)) (custom-set-faces '(whitespace-tab ((t (:foreground "#636363"))))) (setq whitespace-display-mappings '((tab-mark 9 [124 9] [92 9]))) ; 124 is the ascii ID for '|' (global-whitespace-mode) ; Enable whitespace mode everywhere `` I had to comment outsmart-tabs-mode` due to some weird error on my Mac, tho.
 But I'm still curious about that c-basic-offset. Any idea where this random value of "5" came from on my Mac? Can it be different in each distribution of Emacs?
 (FYI, I use the same configuration file for both my Mac and my Linux machine.)

I couldn't find such a list, so decided to write a little tool that builds the hierarchy of major modes, and threw in standalone and minor modes too, along with help links, a docstring, and a flag indicating the origin of the package. 
 More than 700 modes here, with some interesting finds. special-mode? Who knew?

where it is performed. Hermeticity is a prerequisite for generally desirable
features like remote caching and remote
execution. While certain build systems, such as Nix,
impose hermeticity through their design, others rely on their users to do
the extra work and be vigilant to get it. Bazel enforces hermeticity to some
extent, for example through sandboxing, but is less strict about it than
Nix. In this post I’m going to try to enumerate most ways in which
hermeticity of a Bazel project can be compromised.

Execution strategy
One source of inhermeticity is the file system. If tools, such as compilers,
are invoked in a way that does not limit their access to contents of the

 Of course there is modal editing, see https://github.com/mrkkrp/modalka#other-solutions= . But most (all?) of them keep keybindings similar to the original ones.
 Personally, I'd like keybindings to be oriented at the things which the commands operate on, e.g. server, frame, window, project, directory, file, block, region, line, word, cursor. I'd love to have an elisp package which allows me to dedicate a key for each of these things, e.g. I'd dedicate "a" to "server" because with my current keyboard-layout, I type "a" with my pinky which I don't want to use so often and because I don't expect Emacs-server related commands to be called often. I could then type C-a and thus get access to many server-related commands, e.g. I could call "server-start" with C-a s. Then there'd be some easy mechanism to enter and stay in hydras, so that you don't need to type the prefix every time. E.g., the SPC key could toggle that behavior. And apart from these hydras, there'd be one-shot actions available, e.g. C-s for search, as is.
 TLDR: Did anyone make a hydra-hierarchy for all Emacs keys?

 It turns out, there is no simple option! This paper size is determined by the ODT style file that is included with an emacs/org distribution. One option is to explicitly define a custom style in the top lines of the org document itself, but this starts to get very messy quickly. I think the future solution needs to be a switch or setting to integrate with the ox-odt export functions, but that is for another day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just stumbled across this tool recently. I moved all my journal-type notes over to this system. Nice little command-line tool. To me, some of the main benefits are:
Simplicity, of course
You can list files using 'nb list' or just regular 'ls'
Lots of commands to query, list, move, rename, etc. Some of these I find much easier/faster than standard bash commands.
Multiple notebooks
You can auto-sync w/ git repos
You can specify your favorite command-line editor (I'm currently using vim)
Bookmarks, to-dos, tasks, linking
Wiki-style links!
You can browse your links across files/notebooks
Written in Bash!
On the web site there is a section on Zettelkasten as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People say Haskell is difficult, but it isn't really, it's just that the compiler is so unhelpful. I've spent more hours fighting with the vague error messages than writing code and it's making me want to quit and go back to a language with brackets and semicolons, where I can see exactly what the mistake is.
 Is there a better compiler than the GCH thing that everyone recommends? Or a way to make it more verbose?
 Take this message and code for instance which I've been trying to debug for an hour now:
  Couldn't match expected type ‘[a]’ with actual type ‘(Int, [a], [a])’ • In the expression: foldr go (0, sourceList, sourceList) indexes 
 hs permute indexes sourceList = foldr go (0, sourceList, sourceList) indexes where go :: Int -> (Int, [a], [a]) -> (Int, [a], [a]) 
 Why doesn't the compiler say 1. which function expects the type - is foldr, go, sourcelist, indexes? 2. which parameter in the function expects the type? 3. which part of the call is the 'actual type'?

 I can throw that up on melpa as ox-slack2 (or whatever) but it seems more appropriate to try and contact the maintainer of the original and either get them incorporated there or take over its maintenance. So, I'm reaching out to you all to see if any of you know how to reach him and could dm me the info, or point him at this post.
 The guy behind it is Matt Price. He teaches / taught at the University of Toronto. I've explored various rabbit holes but none of them seem to lead to anything with an email / working twitter / anything else. 
 Assuming that doesn't work, I have it in my head that it might be technically possible for me to replace his package on melpa without his permission? If so, it seems like a jerk move, but one that may be appropriate in this case. Any advice around how to proceed if i can't contact him would be appreciated. I'm not sure how situations like this are normally handled.

I don't like "M-f" as I don't find it ergonomic enough, so I'm sticking to "C-S-f" (ctrl+shift+f). Which isn't perfect too (doesn't even work in my terminal, only in GUI Emacs), but at least I use two pinkies and then I press "f" to move word forward.
 But... what I'd really like is to press "Ctrl+f", then release "f" and *then* press 'w' to move word forward and be able to press "w" as many times I want until I release "Ctrl".
 Is it possible in emacs? Does it have a name already?

 I've been thinking of a repository/database with snippets of code for Emacs. With utility functions and commands we put in .emacs, but are not big enough to put in a library. Centralized, classified, tagged, browsable from Emacs, maybe the web too. 
 Is this a good idea? Is there something like that already? If not, do you have ideas on how to implement? 
 I know there's the EmacsWiki, but it's not quite the thing I'm looking for.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I write my blog with Zola, a static site generator written in Rust, but I'm also an emacser, so I wanted to export my org-mode files to Zola's markdown and set up an org-centric workflow. 
 In order to do that, I searched for a solution outside but I saw no libraries. So, I thought I could tweak the wonderful ox-hugo exporter, which cover most of the needs in the "org to markdown" field, being it thought for Hugo (another static site generator which works parsing markdown files). I'm a newbie in emacs lisp, so I'm sure there are more elegant ways to achieve what I did, but my solution was forking ox-hugo (in ox-zola) and hacking it to make it compatible with Zola needs. 
 There were some minor differences that made the exported broken, but now it should work by default. More specifically, I added this Zola-relative features:
  
Custom frontmatters parameters
 Lastmod/updated tags
 Taxonomies
  
I'm already using this library in production for my blog for a while, so I thought this could be the moment to share it with everybody. If you need this exporter, please use it; if you want to add features, feel free to make a PR.
 Thanks to all of you for this lovely community, I leave the link to the repo below.

 I'm not new to emacs but new to both programming and emacs lisp.
 I wanted an org agenda view that would not only show me TODO items with a specific priority tag (#A, #B, #C) but also include corresponding dates in the agenda's header line (#A=today, #B=tomorrow, #C=week).
 It turned out that this was not very straight-forward, but I managed it using only internal functionality:
 (defun current-time-tomorrow () (let ((now (current-time))) (list (car now) (+ (cadr now) 86400) (caddr now) (cadddr now)))) (defun date-list-today () (let ((date-dmy (reverse (nthcdr 3 (reverse (nthcdr 3 (decode-time))))))) (list (cadr date-dmy) (car date-dmy) (caddr date-dmy)))) (defun current-week-mon () (let* ((day-of-week (calendar-day-of-week (date-list-today))) (diff-to-week-start (* 86400 (cond ((zerop day-of-week) -1) ((= day-of-week 1) 0) (t (- day-of-week 1))))) (now (current-time))) (list (car now) (- (cadr now) diff-to-week-start) (caddr now) (cadddr now)))) (defun current-week-sun () (let* ((mon (current-week-mon))) (list (car mon) (+ (cadr mon) (* 6 86400)) (caddr mon) (cadddr mon)))) 
 Obviously, since I'm a programming noob, I'm proud to have achieved that without the help of knowledgeable reddit people. I just realized that I could have used alphapapas ts library, which would've sped up the resolution of the issue considerably, lol. Yet, I'm still wondering if there would have been an easier way, using only emacs' builtin functionality, to achieve this. 
 Have a good day, fellows :)

 Is there a way to make sure that the buffer stays the same and it is not replaced with the shell output?
 This is my function. Thank you in advance:
 (defun jp-define () (interactive) (let ( (word (buffer-substring-no-properties (region-beginning) (region-end)))) (shell-command (format "tango '%s'" word) "*tango*") (let ( (content (with-current-buffer "*tango*" (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max)) ))) (text-translator-pos-tip-show content) )))

I've been learning ledger, a plaintext accounting software, for about a week now. It is great and I already feel like I have more agency over my finances.
 Stocks can be converted by ledger to their values in a given currency, however prices have to be set manually in a file. Here is an example line from my prices.ledger:
 P 2022/09/05 11:11:00 "PETR4.SA" 33.79 BRL 
 Which means that each PETR4.SA share was Priced at 33.79 BRL on the date and time indicated.
 As I didn't find a way to easily fetch prices automatically, I came up with my own set of elisp functions to do that. Now, I only need to set the point anywhere over the last price entry for a some share and M-x ledger-copy-down-commodity-pri…]]></summary>

 I have been looking at aws-sdk-scalajs-facade, but it is not available for Scala 3. Will it ever be available for Scala 3? Are there alternatives? How hard would it be to hack my own lambda? (I know very little about Node or Javascript).
 Another option might be Scala-native, but I am not sure how mature it is.

 Im super new to haskell so please don't bully me too much lol.
 Ok so... defining functions goes for example like this correct?
 functionC :: Integer -> Integer
 functionC num1 = functionB(functionA(num1))
 And I read that the second line in haskell is usually shortened using the "." operator to this
 functionC :: Integer -> Integer
 functionC = functionB . functionA
 But im confused as to how the second better version would know what the input is? functionB gets its input from the output of functionA.. but where does functionA get it from? I didnt give functionC any parameters nor am I calling function A to give it parameters right?

 Did you like the YAML-like look of fewerBraces extension? Then take it to the next level, with Yamlike - left-pad sized library, that provides customizable DSL that looks like lists in YAML.
  
Bonus for ZIO 1.x users:
 Automatically build your dependency graph from unordered list of ZLayers. Just like ZIO 2.x does it with provide macro.
 zio.provideLayers( - layer1 - layer2 - layer3 (...) )

 I often want to write down "records" (ie. collections of key-value pairs) in orgmode and have not yet hit upon a canonical way to do it...
 Evidently there are many ways to do that (and no single right way), so I simply wonder how other people do it - and maybe learn from their reasons of why they do it one way vs another way.
 As an example I want to make a note of a new email-account I have registered:
 I want to record the email-address itself, the password, a recovery-code and the date.
 How would you represent this in org-mode?
 Many thanks!

Considered example (https://wiki.haskell.org/Infix_expressions):  xs `zipWith (+)` ys  is not unique. What's about  a `sumMod m` b = (a + b) `mod` m  for addition by modulo m? I don't think this syntax sugar makes code more readable like using functions in infix mode in general. And I don't see any problems with misunderstanding it. Of course, if someone will right huge expression in infix mode it will be unreadable, but it can be said for a bad-styled code without any syntax sugar too. So I don't understand, why it's not implemented so, what's reason to restrict infix behavior to function names only?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It just so happened that all this Akka stuff happened the week before I needed to do the licensing & security talk in one of my other classes - a software development studio class taught in Java, but given I also teach a Scala unit I gravitate to talking about Scala stuff a lot.
 Anyway, here is my (waffly/uncertain/etc) take on trying to use the Akka licence change as a case study to explain to second year undergrads some of the social implications that get packed into that tiny line of sbt code "libraryDependencies += ..." (and the equivalent in gradle).
 https://echo360.net.au/media/b9b8b8c1-90c6-41a3-bf92-8426309a5cc5/public 
 With many thanks to everyone who's been discussing this so openly. And many apologies if I've mischaracterised anything - it's certainly not my intent to express "rights or wrongs" - the motivation here is that we have to teach our software classes about ethics and security, and this seemed a very interesting (and fairly accessible) case study to introduce that topic to a class where I've mostly been talking about code, testing, version control etc. Using a library that I taught some of the students last trimester.
 Posted also because it's an admission of why I've been replying in the comments more than usual on this even though I'm just some unheard-of academic in a small town - I had a class to write, so had to think about the topic more than usual last week.
 So this is me doing a first take on trying to introduce the social impacts of dependencies to a (small) Australian class. Feedback welcome, especially if I've mischaracterised anything so I can correct it for the future. [But even comments like "you really should stop saying 'kind of' as a verbal tic so often" welcome]
 (PS: I'll probably delete this reddit post after a month or two, so that years down the track, some old lecture of mine isn't lurking in public. Maybe sooner if it turns out I've accidentally made a big faux pas anywhere in here!)

 When I connected it asked me if I want to accept the servers fingerprint. And that was that, connected. I never connected to this machine before, so it certainly has no ssh keys from me. In fact the WSL I was doing this from didn't even have a ssh Gen generated. 
 Using Tramp in emacs with C-x C-f /ssh:x.y.z.ip:/ it asks me for a password. Problem is, I don't know the password.
 So, I tried generating a ssh key on my WSL machine and transfered it into /home/root/.ssh/authorized_keys, but that didn't help either. SIC! about the directory (although I don't not know if I did something wrong.)
 Does anyone know how to pull this off?

 I'm looking for some advice for the next steps in my career. I hope this will not be considered too off-topic.
 I entered the software industry in July 2021, so a little over a year ago, after doing a full-stack bootcamp based on Java 7. Totally OOP-ish apart from some Java 8 taught at the end of it.
 Funnily enough, while still doing the bootcamp something drew me into researching more about FP. I started reading SICP, and changed from Vim to Doom Emacs thinking I would be forced to learn some Lisp. And I remember reading these discussions about monads and stuff I was really far from understanding at the time.
 My first job was actually as an OutSystems low-code developer, for... reasons. However, around September 2021, I decided I would learn Haskell, in my own free time. I k…]]></summary>

 I am wrapping some FFI code, by writing classes where the methods map directly to the imported functions, for which bindings and instances are generated. 
 Some of the functions are for managing and converting foreign arrays. In particular the functions for creating the foreign arrays have the (slightly simplified) form newArray pointerToValues dim0 dim1 dim2 ... dimN so the number of dim arguments differs depending on the dimensionality of the array. 
 Now, one way to solve this is to generate a 'uncurried' version of that function and giving the dimensions as a tuple, but I want to maintain a minimal amount of generated code, and like the idea of mapping methods directly to the imported functions.

 I use emacs but im not very advanced but my initial reaction to this tweet was think it was bs and that the professor wasn't very experienced in emacs. I didn't know he was a professor until after I responded. he said he's been using emacs for 23 years. I asked him what made him believe that and he said that in vscode he can install extensions that resemble the functionality he was use to in emacs.

 if you have used both emacs and vscode is this true? is he not as experienced despite all the years he has used emacs?

I received help and advice from many talented colleagues on Tweag’s Nix Slack channel during this process.
Nix is a package manager with a focus on reproducible, declarative and reliable packages.
Nixpkgs is an enormous collection of software packages that can be installed with the Nix package manager.
Due to the way Nix works, all packages must define precisely all of their dependencies (their dependency closure) down to the operating system’s kernel.
This rigor-by-design with respect to dependencies is what makes Nix packages highly reproducible, and as a side effect, it gives us a fantastic dataset: the full dependency network that the more th…]]></summary>

 I can't remember what I was doing at the time it broke that may have caused it. 
 Previous TODOs from days before show up, just not new ones. If I put a TODO in a day before it broke, it works and shows up. It is just the last two days oddly that don't work. They are all in the same directory, and named with the same convention. 
 I still have (setq org-agenda-files '("~/org-roam/daily")) in my init.el and have not changed it. The directory is correct. 
 The value for org-scheduled-delay-days is 0, so it isn't that either.

 P 'Z is stuck, and P is closed, so I don't know how we could ever have an equality constraint that makes it equal to 'Z. Similarly, we can't construct a singleton SN (P 'Z). But I'm not sure how to convince GHC of this fact. I expected q2a to work, but GHC thinks we are missing some case branches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a little hard to discuss because emacs and tmux use the term 'window' differently, but in tmux the window is basically your full terminal. So, your terminal might have 6 'panes' across 2 'windows' in a session, with one window containing 2 panes and the other four in a second window. Rather than be in separate floating program windows in your DE though, tmux windows are not visible until you cycle to them. So your setup might look like:
  ________________ _________________ | | | | | | | | | | vim | node | | st | python | -> :next-window -> |________|________| | | | | | | | | | | watch | ranger | |_______|________| |________|________| 
 Is there any way to get this functionality (multiple buffers laid out in different ways in one wm box that can be cycled through) in emacs? (I'm focusing on the GUI version of emacs for now, not particularly interested in running emacs inside tmux at the moment)
 edit: another thing I'm looking for is the ability to toggle 'zoom' an emacs window to fullscreen and back to its place, which I believe is 'c-b z' in tmux

emacs: GNU Emacs 29.0.50
 vterm: 20220831.835
  
I'm using zsh with xfce4-terminal. 
 My OS prompt is configured using the powerlevel10k theme.
 I have 2 separate configurations for p01k, one for my OS and one for inside emacs. This is copied verbatim from the vterm repo 
 My .zshrc vterm configuration
 I believe it's working because I can see visually that it's different from my OS terminal and when I run p10k configurein an emacs vterm buffer, it prompts to save to bin/p10.emacs.zsh
 The main difference i those 2 p10k configs is that the one for emacs has no prompt on the right hand side - I've given up all hope of getting it to work in vterm. 
 vterm is working but there's one problem. The unicode glyphs in the prompts look different.
  
OS prompt example
 vterm prompt example 
 It appears as if the line height in emacs is a taller than the font size. There is an unappealing strip of background colour above the font making it look as if the glyphs don't align. Whereas they match perfectly in the OS terminal. 
 Any ideas for how I can fix this so that they look the same and I can have an aesthetically pleasing prompt in vterm?

Both modules define error handling functions like try, handle and catch, and the later one has more specific function for IOError: handleIO, catchIO and tryIO. I am curious about them and want to see their documents. While I can easily find Control.Exception's module by Google, I cannot find the module Exception's. I have tried out several searching keywords but none of them brought me meaningful results.
 P.S. I was also wondering why there are two modules for error handling, what are histories behind them?

 Caesar's Revenge

 . Pencil & paper cipher requires no computer

 . Auto encrypting/decrypting (no password needed)

 . Great for masking text in hand-written notes

 SYNOPSES

 Concerning Julius Caesar's military communications, Roman historian Suetonius
 wrote: "If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, and by
 so  changing  the  order  of the letters of the alphabet, not a word could be
 made out."

 Caesar's Revenge is an enhanced variant of the Caesar cipher [i] that, unlike
 its  predecessor, understands both digits & case sensi…]]></summary>

 TLDR: I would like to continue my learning journey, replacing a Rest Service with a new library in order to get experience with Scala, I don't know if Akka HTTP worth with their new license change.
 I'm a software developer with almost 4 years of experience, I've been developing on Python for the latest years, working on data gathering & cleaning, a little bit of machine learning, and some Rest Services with FastAPI.
 Since some couple of months I've been using Spark (Mostly DataFrames) for processing, Since then I fall in love with Scala and Functional Programming in general, I can not see the opportunity to implement high order functions, recursion, pattern matching in everywhere (I think even the way I think problem-solving have change).
 I've taken the Scala & FP Essentials  and Spark Essentials with Scala from RockTheJVM and I absolutely loved! 
 Now I'm feeling that I would like to switch my career more orientated into Scala and functional programming, I feel I could improve some of the Rest Services in my current job replacing it with Scala, but I haven't seen a roadmap or something like that to use it for learning purpose. 
 I was reading about Akka Http, but I don't know if does it worth to learn with new changes on their license (TBH, I'm only understanding that will be oriented in business), which library or framework should I learn? In my current job there is no tech team behind to report so I could choose whatever stack as long it is free to use. 
 Thank you for your advices and reading this post!

 As the question below is part of homework I would greatly appreciate pointers as to what I'm doing wrong, but I'd rather not be given a complete solution. Even though I'm sure there are way smarter ways of approaching this 'simple' task. 
 Context
 The task is to write a function that takes a list of any type of element and shuffles it by first taking every other element and then repeating it on the rest of the list. For example given the list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] should output [0,2,4,6,1,5,3].
 To solve this I wrote the following function:

 I am writing a library and I am wondering about my package name. My old Java instincts tell me to use ext.domain.project (e.g io.github.iltotore) but I often see imports with only the name of the project like in Haoyi ecosystem (mill, os (os-lib), utest ...), Cats or ZIO.
 Actually, my package name is a bit long with the ext.domain.project model but I am worried by potential name clashes.

I’ve recently come across a well known and influential book on historical method from the late 1800s that has well described version of the slip (box) method.
Originally published in French in 1897 as Introduction aux études historiques and then translated into English by George Godfrey Berry, Henry Holt and Company published Introduction to the Study of History in 1898 by authors Charles Victor Langlois and Charles Seignobos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing with the Brick terminal UI library and hit an interesting hurdle. Roughly, brick represents the program logic as two functions Event -> State -> IO State and State -> Image.
 I have some non-trivial IO (loading and parsing files, possibly transitively) which should not block key inputs. We can launch some async IO and send the results into an event queue which Brick reads from. But it is really annoying:
  
The update function must know which async resources to load, duplicating parts of the rendering logic
 The update function must track which resources are already loaded
 The update function must track which requests are in-flight, or have failed
 Optionally, the update function may have to cancel requests that are no longer needed
  
That's quite a bit of complexity for a simple update function! My approach so far has been Haxl-like. There is a function CoreState -> IO AppState which is run after every event is processed, and it re-loads all resources. Requests are represented by a GADT, and cached in an MVar wrapped map. A functionsend :: MonadAsync r m => r a -> m (Maybe a) retrieves the existing result, or starts a new request unless one is in flight. When a request finishes this queues an event so Brick updates.
 This solves some of the complexity issues but still feels kind of ad-hoc. Shouldn't Haskell be better at this sort of thing? Is there some existing approach to this?
 The only idea I had so far is some kind of declarative IO. The render function produces an Image, and the frame-work diffs images and produces some imperative commands to synchronize the world. Maybe the render function also could produce a sort-of free-monad trace, the trace is diffed, and the framework performs some imperative steps to ensure the minimal necessary requests are performed? But for diffing to work trace would have to contain which case-statement branches were taken, not sure how to do that without compiler support.

 I am okay with using TODO and not checkboxes. How to achieve this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been learning haskell through multiple sources (one being a free online course) and I've gotten to learning about monoids. However, I'm still struggling a bit on understanding typeclasses.
 I understand a typeclass is similar to, say, an interface in Java or c#, in that typeclasses can be used to define things that work for all classes that define an instance for said class (similar to implementing an interface). But I don't fully understand how the type signatures work, or when to use a vs b in polymorphic signatures. 
 For example, I can define a typeclass
  class Foo a where prev :: a -> a next :: a -> a 
 But I don't understand how that would differ from the same typeclass defined as:
 class Foo a where prev :: a -> b next :: b -> a 
 To put this another way, I'm fairly sure I understand the theory, but I don't know how to apply it very well.
 (All that said, I'm loving my time with learning haskell. Such a great language.)
 (Sorry for formatting. Don't understand how to do multi-line code on mobile)

 Specifically:
  
Is haskell-mode still the go to package? 
 
Are there any issues with lsp-mode or is it recommended that I configure haskell-mode?
 
What is a good way to use ghci repl in emacs? I have ghcup installed.

 I've just tried dumping my Emacs after it loads packages and is configured.
 Like this:
  emacs --batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(dump-emacs-portable "emacs.dump")' 
 Then I start my already configured Emacs:
  emacs -q --dump-file emacs.dump 
 Emacs starts a lot faster this way.
 Why are we Emacs users not taking advantage of this? Or this is well known already?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the beginning of 2022, we decided to get rid of Akka at work and built our own alternative to the last bit of Akka that didn't have a good alternative: sharding (more details on our motivations and architecture choices in a talk I'm planning to do later this year).
 After 6 months in production we decided to release it as an open source library called Shardcake: https://github.com/devsisters/shardcake (it was coincidentally made public a few hours before the Akka licence change announcement).
 In a nutshell, Shardcake makes it easy to distribute entities across multiple servers and interact with those entities using their ID without knowing their actual location (the entity behavior and persistence is entirely up to you, the library only takes care of the distribution and messaging). It exposes a purely functional API based on ZIO. It was designed to be simple to use, lightweight (unlike Akka, nodes do not form a cluster) and customizable: you can change the messaging protocol, the serialization, the storage layer as well as the source of truth for pod's health.
 It's been working great for us, so I hope others find it useful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been working on my hobby programming language and there's three things I want to write for it: a type checker, type inference, and a program synthesizer. While writing each of these I realized there was a lot of similarity in the code to the point that it almost felt like the same thing three times. I realized if I was working in Prolog I could probably express this as typed(term, type, errorList) and then I could get supply a term and a type to see if if type checks, a term and an empty error list to infer the type, and a type and an empty error list to get program synthesis. It would be nice to be able to express this relation in Haskell with a similar style and elegance but I'm not sure if it's possible since I'm not sure if I can do logic programming with similar levels of optimizations in Haskell. logict doesn't seem to do any kind of optimization and I'm guessing this would make my code unusable in practice.
 Is my assumption that logic programming without optimizations is unusable in practice correct? Does anyone know if it's possible to do logic programming in Haskell that has performance comparable to Prolog?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm creating a latex document in japanese with lots of furigana and some footnotes. The command to create the kanji with footnote is \edtext{\ruby{kanji}{reading}}{\Afootnote{meaning}, where kanji, reading and meaning are my inputs.
 ​
 Is there any way to quickly create them? Yasnippets doesn't seem to work well since I use three different input-modes, japanese for the kanji, japanese-hiragana for the reading and nil for the meaning.
 ​
 I created the following function:
 (defun jane/latex-footnote () (interactive) (let ((my-input current-input-method)) (set-input-method 'japanese) (let ((kanji (read-string "What's the kanji: " nil nil nil t))) (set-input-method 'japanese-hiragana) (let ((reading (read-string "What's the reading: " nil nil nil t)) (footnote (read-string "What's the footnote: "))) (insert (concat "\\edtext\{\\ruby\{" kanji "\}\{" reading "\}\}\{\\Afootnote\{" footnote "\}")))) (set-input-method my-input))) 
 It does work, but I do need to type the kanji twice. Once for the kanji, and twice for it's reading. Is there any way to improve my function?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there folks,
 Lacking real-world resources has often been acknowledged in this community. Although we've come a long way, there's still a lot of room for improvement.
 For a while I've been thinking of starting a movement of sorts to help collect and organize various Haskell patterns and tricks from the real world. Harnessing the full power of my originality, I've decided to name it the "Practical Haskell Bits" initiative.
 More details in the blog post:
 https://dnikolovv.github.io/practical-haskell-bits-initiative/
 repository
 This is still a "proof of concept" idea and I'm not really sure where it'll end up. Nonetheless it seems worth thinking about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! Whenever I try to load a .beancount file (plain text accounting, similar to ledger) I get this error: error "Lisp nesting exceeds ‘max-lisp-eval-depth’". Here is my usual workflow: first of all I load the beancont.el file (the mode isn't available on melpa) with load-file, and I get this: Loading /home/sgrc31/personal/finanze/beancount-mode/beancount.el (source)...done ,then if I try to load my "main.beancount" file i get the aforementioned error.
 Here is the backtrace: https://pastebin.com/pQ9c5MA2
 \ I already tried to start emacs without my config (with the -q switch), but the problem persisted. It may also help to say that I used beancount mode without any issue for several months, and all of a sudden this problem occured 3 weeks ago. This morning I updated all my packages and cloned the beancount mode repo afresh, but nothing changed. How can I fix this? Thanks for your time

If I start Emacs the 1st time it starts dead center. Thereafter it moves ever so slightly to the right of my screen. It does this a few times before starting in the center again. I would always like it to start in the same place.
