 Better yet, can I just have one file?

 Release notes:
  
This release fixes potential bugs.
 The hash that Stack uses to distinguish one build plan from another has changed for plans that set (as opposed to unset) manually Cabal flags for immutable dependencies. This will cause Stack to rebuild dependencies for such plans.
  
Changes since v2.15.5:
 Major changes:
  
Stack 2.15.5 and earlier cannot build with Cabal (the library) version 3.12.0.0. Stack can now build with that Cabal version.
  
Behavior changes:
  
Stack’s StackSetupShim executable, when called with repl and stack-initial-build-steps, no longer uses Cabal’s replHook to apply initialBuildSteps but takes a more direct approach.
  
Bug fixes:
  
Fix a regression introduced in Stack 2.15.1 that caused a ‘no operation’ stack build to be slower than previously.
 The hashes that Stack uses to distinguish one build plan from another now include the Cabal flags for immutable dependencies set manually. Previously, in error, only such flags that were unset manually were included.
  
Thanks to all our contributors for this release:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see a bunch of guidance on using nix with Haskell online, but much it seems old and outdated. Is there any current guidance on this available? Is using stack with nix integration enabled and a shell.nix file still recommended? Is using a flake with nix develop an option (I know I can use nix to install ghc with a bunch of extra haskell libraries, but I don’t know how to then access those libraries, since a build system would presumably want to install them itself).
 Honestly, I’d be okay with just using stack normally, but inside a nix develop shell, if that’s possible. I am on NixOS, so some amount of nix interaction is necessary I’m sure. 
 Thanks.

 Contacting host elpa.gnu.org:443 hangs forever.
 You want to refresh your packages, or install a new one, and this is what happens.
 Well, yesterday I have been sifting all day through these help forums, all the while trying from time to time to install a package from elpa, and had no success (not even in understanding what was the issue).
 Today, early morning, I gave it one last try, and... there you go! It all went smoothly, no glitches.
 EDIT: Don't take this too seriously.
 EDIT: In my "research" I noted that one recurring answer was "be patient, elpa.gnu.org is known to be slow some times", and this is my experience as well (starting at least in 2020) so I was wondering how much this is common knowledge.
 EDIT: I am not bringing forward that it actually goes down on Saturday!!! That was just to underline the unpredictability of this thing.

 Also on Obsidian I used the "one long file" approach for recording daily thoughts, journaling, etc. Seems like org-mode would do this as well. Any suggestions for resources for writers using org-mode?

 Therefore I ported julia-vterm.el to support python with only minor tweaks to make it play nicely with environment variables. All credit belongs to the original author though.
 EDIT: added spyder-like code cell support.
 EDIT: I was unaware of the original author's effort :P and have now cherry-picked/synced what was done there. I guess I'll either give it back to the maintainer of julia-vterm or let it diverge happily while dogfooding it for the next few months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I understand it (From the First Principles book), for the following code to run, you need the FlexibleInstances directive enabled:
 class TooMany a where
 tooMany :: a -> Bool
 instance TooMany (Int, String) where
 tooMany (x, _) = x > 42
 But when I run this code without any directives, it still compiles and runs fine. What am I missing? is FlexibleInstances not nedded anymore? and if it is, for which cases is it needed now? Thank you!

Beside info about how to install lsp or other utilities for langs not already commented in my init.el i am struggling with projects, buffers, workspaces ecc. Fact is if i open treemacs and close it (killing buffers, using M-x close etc) it always opens on a previous "project" what id like to do is close those so called projects and also tell treemacs to open in current working directory (the root of the file im editing at the Moment). Can you give me general advise on how to manage this kind of workflow in doom? i know little about nvim (used nvchad s bit) but i know vim keybinds. Also do you rather use vterm or a terminal outside emacs? (i'm using emacs launching it as emacsclient -c -a 'emacs')

However, could the new context function mechanism be used to simplify coding using existing effect systems like C-E?

For sure, the current typical C-E "for-comp-of-dooom" isn't so neat really...

 I'm just looking for alternatives as I'm burned out on imperative programming (after Georgia Tech OMSCS). 
 Web still seems to be where the jobs are so I want to do everything in pure functional programming languages (Elixir seems popular but watching a video looked a bit too magical). I've also tried Elm which I like but it's frontend only so was thinking Elm frontend and Haskell backend but if I can stick to one language for the full stack I'd rather do that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Emacs veterans,
 I encountered a situation like the following. I am working on a project and a tool is used when building the project. The tool requires me to add a line in my `.bashrc` which `source` a script file that does something and source another three files. This means without sourcing the file, that tool is not usable from command line and I can't build the project. Recently, I am learning to use "compile" command of Emacs to work on this project. I found because that tool needs that sourcing of the script, I can't simply make use of the tool with "compile" command.
 One possibility is to dig through all the scripts involved, figured out what they do, and somehow set them up manually in some fixed way, but this would be a tedious work, also, it'd be not reliable after I upgrade the tool in the future.
 Currently, my solution is that I use `bash -i -c 'the_tool params..'` instead of `the_tool params...`. Although this works for me for the case at the moment, it's not very handy, and I wonder what the better solutions out there that experienced Emacs users will do.
 It seems I can also make Emacs source my `.bashrc` when Emacs starts, but I am not sure if I want to source `.bashrc` every time my Emacs loads, because this tool is only needed for doing a particular type of project development.
 I wonder what would you guys do for this situation. Thanks in advance for you input.
 P. S. I didn't say the name of the tool with an intention that I want to know ways to deal with this as a general situation, instead of learning for example, that a package exists that is for this tool for this situation.

 I want emacs-eat's semi-char mode to not send the key M-o to the terminal and instead pass it to Emacs (I use it to switch windows instead of the clumsy C-x o).
 I tried doing this
  (add-to-list 'eat-semi-char-non-bound-keys (vector meta-prefix-char ?o)) (eat-update-semi-char-mode-map) 
 which seems to correctly set the variable eat-semi-char-mode-map to not have M-o bound to eat-self-input, but then M-o still gets passed to the terminal when I press it!
 After some searching, I found the code
  (define-minor-mode eat--semi-char-mode "Minor mode for semi-char mode keymap." :interactive nil :keymap eat-semi-char-mode-map) 
 In eat.el where the map is used. I found out that if I redefine the minor mode after changing the keymap, my key binding works as expected (M-o get passed to Emacs instead of the terminal).
 What's the reason for this? I thought that the minor mode should have a dynamic keymap based on the variable eat-semi-char-mode-map, but it seems that I need to redefine the minor mode for the changes to take effect.

Nevertheless, a formal, taxonomic dimension is, obviously, also not completely absent. When I branch of from 1a into 1a1, it also normally means, that 1a1 (and 1a2,...) provides analysis of greater details of 1a1, which now becomes the main context for all the children. It does not only mean that I got back to the topic of 1a later, while I had made notes about different topics in 1b and 1c in between. Thus, it seems to me there is a playful tension between a formal structure (topic, subtopic, detail and so forth) …]]></summary>

I just had a vision of a Transient menu, that would let you choose Avy targets and actions separately. Like, select target "word" and then select either "goto", "kill", "copy" etc.
 So I'm curious if anyone's made an Avy menu like that, or in any other way!

 Suppose I have (in an org-mode file):
 * A ** a1 ** TODO a2 * B ** b1 
 If I narrow the buffer using C-x n s (narrow to subtree) on "B", and then run C-c a t to get an agenda buffer with all the todo items, this agenda buffer will show me only "TODO a2", regardless of the fact that the buffer is narrowed do subtree "B", which is correct. But when I try to kill this "TODO a2" item in the agenda buffer using C-k, org-mode kills "b1" instead.
 Is this a bug or is there some variable to configure here? I've updated my Emacs recently, and I remember that in the previous version (26), whenever I called the agenda the narrowing would automatically be undone, and this problem didn't occur.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first came across the idea of Zettelkasten probably 2-3 years ago. I was intrigued, and spent some time reading and researching about it, but I just couldn't visualize how it actually worked.
Then last fall I was helping my wife find a replacement for Evernote for her recipes, and discovered Obsidian. (It was more than she needed, she went with SimpleNote) but I was intrigued by the idea of linked notes. I downloaded it, watched some videos and started putting stuff in it. I had used various programs before, but they ended up just becoming archives of stuff, and not really useful for production of ideas. I'm working to not fall in that trap this time.
Probably the two most helpful things for me have been Sonke Ahren's book and a few videos by Morgan Eau on YouTube. This is a great place to start 
I am going back to school after retiring, entering a doctorate program. That's a bit intimidating at 53. I've got a couple of masters, but it's been a while. I'm really hoping using Zettelkasten principles in Obsidian will aid me in my endeavor.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to figure out how to use org-mode and org-brain together as data management. The extension of the org-mode headings hierarchy into a graph (parent-child-friend) with org-brain is great for me. But now I'm needing something very data-intensive, in my case I need to create an inventory which will easily have thousands of items. I am working for an apartment complex and I need a way to inventory all the fixed and non-fixed assets. I don't want to just go with a relational database or even a spreadsheet. Yes, org-mode/brain is text- and file-based, so each inventory item will be a separate file or heading in a file, but I don't want even more separate files and/or headings for each inventory item's details. One idea I had was to create a lisp defvar symbol for each inventory item (e.g., screens, garden hose, picnic table, etc.) and have a list (a-/p-) assigned to the variable with additional info, e.g., '((size xxx) (count 10)...). But then I've got a huge amount of global variables going on in an Emacs session. This seems impractical, but, hey, I've seen crazy data management stuff done in Emacs lisp.
 Another idea is to do the items as org-mode/brain files or headings, then put item details in an org-mode table -- and rely on the whole org table ecosystem. Another idea is have item details in a custom drawer in a file or under a heading. Another is have very broad inventory categories as variables, then attach huge lists of lists of lists to each variable. (e.g., custom-set-variables in my init file with hundreds of lists.) In general, the Lisp world is wont to leverage the abstract syntax tree, and org-element is there to help with that. But where does my situation fit in, is my question.

Compiling higher order functions with GADTs by Srijan
Implementing first class functions in a bytecode interpreter is trivial. But how do compilers that generate machine code (or lower to C, or SSA) implement higher order functions? Back in 2021, I found an answer when contributing closures to the Pallene compiler. Today I was researching something loosely related, and found yet another neat trick called defunctionalization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to set up desktop mode. It works in "normal" standalone emacs mode, but when I am in client/daemon mode, I cannot load the desktop in a new frame.
 This is the relevant part of my config:
 ;(desktop-save-mode 1)
 (setq desktop-path (list user-emacs-directory))
 (setq desktop-dirname user-emacs-directory)
 (setq desktop-base-file-name "emacs-desktop")
 (setq desktop-load-locked-desktop t)
 Note that turned of desktop-save-mode for now and am just trying to do it manually, to exclude another source of errors.
 The command 'desktop-save-in-desktop-dir' seems to work fine, and if I restart the emacs server and then connect an emacs client and do "desktop-read", I get my desktop back.
 But if I just close the emacs client and keep the server running, if I reopen another client and do "desktop-read", I get the error (?):
 "Not reloading the desktop; already loaded"
 Any ideas? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love org mode and I love vim bindings which I get from evil. So far so good. The thing is, that's pretty much all I really need/want. So, I feel like I have this super complex piece of software for something that shouldn't require it.
 What's the problem with that you ask? Well, it just seems like whenever I have to do anything slightly outside of my normal routine it's a lot more work and complexity to figure out than I want. I'm busy and I just don't have a lot of time to tinker. Some people do which is great, but not me. 
 For org mode all I really need is folding. Folding and the ability to move levels of folding around easily. Is there something like this that works well with markdown or something that would make more sense for me? I used VIM for years, maybe it's worth another try? 
 This isn't a complaint, Emacs is really cool. I'm just wondering if I should stick with it.

When I tried package-refresh-contents, I got a "can't check signature: No public key" error. So I've gone down the reddit/stack overflow/google rabbit hole but nothing I've tried has worked. 
 2 weeks ago I installed Mint and emacs on my desktop and everything worked fine. Both installs of Mint are from the same iso on the same thumb drive. I installed both emacs from the Software Manager, so they're both 27.2. I'm at my wit's end here. I'd love to leave Windows behind but this kind of thing is a major obstacle for me. Any suggestions welcome!

 By now I've used a lot of cl-lib, seq, map, as well as dash.
 Here's the thing. Usually, I want a codebase to be consistent and use the minimum vocabulary. Basically "pick a library and stick with it", instead of mixing and matching.
 Seq/map can go a long way, but eventually without fail I'll arrive at a situation where I think "ok, the vastly most elegant way to express this is with an --iterate", or something. So now I have one dash invocation, and may as well factor out all uses of seq. So today, I don't even start using seq anymore because I know I will have to factor it out anyway.
 Dash always wins in the end. The only real contender is cl-lib, and if you pair it with llama, it can ev…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a piece of software that transforms a piece of data through several states. To make sure data is only passed to steps in the right state, it is encoded in the type system. Additionally, in different states, parts of the data may have different types. For example (assume DataKinds and TypeFamilies):
 data State = A | B | C type family Foo (s :: State) where Foo 'A = String Foo 'B = [Int] Foo 'C = String data Bar (s :: State) = Bar { x :: Int, y :: Foo s } 
 Now, even though Foo 'A and Foo 'C are equal, and we can have
 atoc :: Foo 'A -> Foo 'C atoc = id 
 we can't have
 atoc' :: Bar 'A -> Bar 'C atoc' = id 
 This makes sense to me, and I wouldn't want id to be a valid implementation anyway since the whole point of having the state in the type is that data in different states is not equal. That said, it would be nice if there was a way of coercing Bar 'A to Bar 'C. We can use record update syntax to assign y to itself, i.e.
 atoc'' :: Bar 'A -> Bar 'C atoc'' b = b { y = y b } 
 but is there really no other way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a library prairie that allows you to work with record fields as regular values. There's a lot of neat functionality buried in here - you can take two Records and diff them to produce a [Update record], you can apply that with updateRecord :: (Record rec) => rec -> [Update rec] -> rec. Fields can be serialized and deserialized, allowing a type like [Update rec] to be parsed out of a JSON response - now you can have your API clients send just a list of fields to update on the underlying record.
 One of those functions is tabulateEntityA, which allows you to specify an applicative action f for every field, and construct a record from that.
 tabulateEntityA :: (Record rec, Applicative f) => (forall ty. Field rec ty -> f ty) -> f rec 
 Several folks have recognizes that the form Applicative f => (forall ty. Field rec ty -> f ty) is a concept on it's own: the ability to distribute the type constructor f across each field of rec. In other words: the power of Higher Kinded Data without needing to incur the complexity costs for operations that do not require it.
 There is one last concern: the name. We have the concept, we have many functions that operate on the concept, but none of the proposed names have stuck out to me.
 I've got a GitHub issue to discuss the matter here: https://github.com/parsonsmatt/prairie/issues/16
 And I'll back-link the Reddit discussion here to GitHub so we can keep everything correlated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read a bunch of comments comparing Org Mode to Markdown and editors like Obsidian but there are some points I want to discuss. A big benefit Emacs Org Mode seems to be the built in functionality for things like tasks and times, but that can be done in Obsidian with plugins like Dataview, for every other functionality Org Mode has like that can be done with an Obsidian plugin. I've also read a lot of comments that you can make your own Org Mode functionality using Elisp, Obsidian OTOH uses JS for plugins and code snippets, and I've written a handful of my own snippets. the JS library ecosystem is much larger.
 I get that Emacs has been around for much longer and the Lindy Effect where things that have lasted a long time are likely to last for much longer, however there seems to be far less support for Org outside of Emacs (besides Neorg). OTOH there are many Markdown editors and libraries, so if I decide I want to switch from Obsidian then I could and my Markdown Notes would render fine. I have many notes and don't have much proprietary Markdown in them. What if I became heavily invested in Emacs but in the future felt like using another editor? Or the slim possibility of Emacs development eventually stopping? A lot of Org Mode functionality seems to be specific to Emacs / Emacs' environment (same thing Obsidian JS really). I read one comment saying that implementations outside of Emacs are half baked, like support for Vim motions and features outside of Vim and Neovim.
 I've been spending lots of time setting up Neovim, and right now I'm thinking of using that with Obsidian for Markdown editing with Vim motions. But I want to know if Org Mode / Neorg would be worthwhile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellow 'macsers,
 title says it all, basically. I would like to use TRAMP to edit files remotely, but a session will only last for five minutes, after which a new connection is opened. This leaves a massive papertrail on the machine which I'd like to avoid, instead staying connected for as long as I'd like.
 I already checked my SSH-settings and don't have these kinds of problems when I am connecting via SSH regularly, which leads me to believe that this is related to Emacs/TRAMP. I have tried to set the ssh session timeout to nil via `(add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties '("/ssh:" "session-timeout" nil))` but so far it does not seem to yield the desired result.
 The setup in which I work features a jump host, so that I connect via SSH twice (once to the jump host, than to my actual destination). I have adapted the SSH `ServerAliveInterval` accordingly on both machines, to no avail.
 Do you guys have another tip on how to configure TRAMP so as to make it work as desired? I'd really LOVE to use TRAMP, because it allows me to use Emacs when editing files remotely instead of vim (which is installed on remote machines).
 Have a good day, fellows!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm an outsider: resident vim user. But more relevantly, I'm an online game developer. One thing I've just noticed is that unlike Emacs, the Vim community has a healthy collection of online vim games: VimAdventures, VimGolf, Vim-Racer (my personal favourite with lots of bias) etc.
 The idea just dawned on me that it would be a really low lift to add support for emacs in vim-racer. I'm curious if there would be any interest in an online game for emacs. The game is based around navigating code/text, and your speed determines where you place on the leaderboard.
 Is the lack of online games just a community culture difference i.e. Emacs users just aren't interested in emacs based games, or would you play a game like vim-racer if it had support for emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After reading many posts on r/emacs and r/orgmode I've realized that there are a lot of people who could benefit from using Org Mode but don't know where to start. Either they don't use Emacs at all and thus find the prospect too daunting or they find it too difficult to craft Org Mode into something useful. And this is a real shame because Org Mode is, in my opinion, one of the most useful features of Emacs. So, to help out new users I've created a tutorial geared towards people who are completely new to Org Mode and Emacs. I've included screenshots to show you what to expect as well as a configuration file you can drop in that will give you all the features described in the tutorial. Additionally, there is an org file with explanations of each element, so new users can more easily begin customizing their setup.
 I would encourage any new users to try it out and see if this helps you. For the Org Mode veterans in the crowd, I would appreciate any feedback you might have. 
 You can find my tutorial on github here: Org Mode Better Defaults

 It’s set to nil by default, and I can turn it into t, but I can’t go back once I do so.
 I even tried setting 2 keybindings, one to turn t and one to turn nil, but nothing, it’s nil, I set it to t, and then it won’t go back via keybinding, even tho if I set it t via init and use the nil keybinding it does, and won’t go back after that.

 I recently started using emacs, and am now trying to find a solution similar to the facebook pathpicker (https://github.com/facebook/PathPicker) plugin for tmux (https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-fpp).
 In effect, this allows you to show all the files (basically paths) in the current tmux buffer and select / open one of them. I was wondering if there is an equivalent in emacs.
 On a related note, I want the same for URLs, similar to https://github.com/dequis/tmux-url-select 
 I was thinking there might already be something in emacs, or perhaps I could achieve this with Hyperbole or some other plugin, but so far could not figure it out. It should not be too hard to script this (I guess you only need to search the buffer for certain regular expressions and then allow the user to select / act on them), but I do not want to reinvent the wheel here. Any ideas?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I write a lot of math heavy documents in org-mode and inline latex fragments really irritate my aesthetic sense. They aren't incorporated into the text smoothly like in a real latex document; when the math has sub and/or superscripts it gets a vertical offset relative to the main text and the font doesn't match the main text either. Equation environments are not as bad, the difference compared to the main text is less obvious there.
 I had the idea to solve this problem using unicode math. There are unicode symbols for basically everything math related, and they blend into the main text nicely, even the sub and superscripts. I managed to set up org-mode to latex export to work with unicode math using the answers in https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/20062/exporting-unicode-characters-to-pdf-using-latex-from-org-mode . The only remaining question is how to write unicode math efficiently.
 I have a nice latex setup that mostly relies on abbrevs and yasnippets. It is very straightforward to set up analogous abbrevs/snippets for common unicode math symbols in org-mode, problems only come when I try to implement sub and superscripts. These work in a completely different way in unicode. Instead of having to surround things with {} or _{}, there are separate sub and superscript versions of many symbols. Should I just make sub and superscript versions for each of my snippets + all the regular letters and numbers? There has to be a simpler way. I also came across the package https://github.com/astoff/unicode-math-input.el that seems to do somethings similar to what I want, however it does nothing about the sub/superscript problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Scala Community,
 I am newbie to Scala language. I have previously worked as Java Developer in the industry and have around 4 years of experience working on Spring Boot framework. However, recently I changed my company and my new company uses Scala as their main language for developing backend applications using Play framework. I have joined as a Software Developer here (not Data Engineer) in hope for learning something new in the field of Software Engineering. I have gone through numerous articles on how Scala skills are considered to be niche skill and has scope mostly in Big Data and Data Engineering roles. I would like to get your valuable insights regarding following concerns :
  
Does learning the FP way of designing applications will help me in longer run in SE industry?
 How much emphasis should be given to learning languages or say new paradigm (I am considering Scala to be more complex than Java, maybe because I'm new to FP) when one's goal is to become a good software engineer?
 Regarding the job market for Scala, I don't see much hope in my region (India) other than DE roles. I am still interested in Software engineering but afraid that investing time in it will be helpful in future or not?
 On the extreme side, should I go back to hone my skills on Java ecosystem (prepare for next switch) or focus in learning Scala language and its ecosystem for maybe next 1-2 years and see if I like it or not? 
  
I tried to keep my doubts as clear as possible. Thanks in advance for your valuable insights.

 With the selName approach as in the _storeDbaField above, it’s rejected as:
 • Could not deduce (GHC.Generics.SingI su) arising from a use of ‘selName’ from the context: (KnownSymbol sel, DbaStorable' f, f ~ K1 R c, DbaField c ft, Typeable c) bound by the instance declaration at src/Frp/DbaStore/Internal.hs:(646,3)-(647,55) • In the expression: selName m In an equation for ‘fieldName’: fieldName = selName m In an equation for ‘_storeDbaField’: 
 But can I really evident SingI instance from my side? Which is unexported from GHC.Generics...
 Otherwise with the symbolVal approach as in the _loadDbaField above, there’s the complain against the ultimate use site:
 • No instance for (GHC.TypeLits.KnownSymbol sel0) arising from a use of ‘storeDba’ • In a stmt of a 'do' block: storeDba rootDir series'data In the expression: do forM_ series'data print storeDba rootDir series'data sd <- loadDba @(Envelope2D Double) rootDir forM_ sd print 
 But I failed to prove KnownSymbol sel with all methods I can think of.
 Help please!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In org-mode, C-c C-x M-w is bound to the super-useful function org-copy-special, which can for example copy a rectangular area in a table. However, unlike M-w, the highlighted region remains highlighted and is still tracking the cursor.
 One can write a function that runs org-copy-special and deactivates the highlight:
 (defun my/org-copy-special () "Copy the current region using `org-copy-special` and deactivate the mark." (interactive) (org-copy-special) (deactivate-mark)) 
 The function works as intended when used via M-x my/org-copy-special, but I struggle with binding it to C-c C-x M-w using use-package's :bind. For example, the following does not work, and invoking C-c C-x M-w will still run org-copy-special:
 (use-package org :bind (("C-c C-x M-w" . my/org-copy-special))) 
 What is the right way to make C-c C-x M-w in org-mode run my/org-copy-special instead of org-copy-special?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Emacs in daemon mode all the time, usually for about 3-4 weeks without restarting. I've had a few crashes over the years, mostly (I believe) caused by memory issues, as my daily driver has only 8 GiB of RAM and I have loads of Firefox Tabs and PDF files open in zathura (some documents display better there than in pdf-tools).
 I'm not sure if switching to the Lucid toolkit will be more performant, but all the advice I see online seems to encourage its use in daemon mode. However, I'm worried about losing a little functionality like viewing HTML mail in mu4e and similar. I think xwidgets won't work either, but I stopped using it after a recent change caused Emacs to crash.
 Are there any breaking, non-aesthetic, changes I should be aware of before I switch?

 Here's a gist with the error
 runSeveral works fine with runReader, but complains about not being able to deduce the effect constraint for my runReaderWithLog which has an extra Members '[Embed IO] r constraint. Any ideas on how to make it compile?
 Some ideas I've considered:
  
Change the type of runSeveral so it applies the same constraints to r and r' - seems like I might have to get into the weeds of Dict and the constraints package, which I'd rather avoid
 
Change the type of runSeveral such that r = r', but then I also get type errors that I suspect are telling me this is the wrong approach - why should r and r' be the same?
 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my Haskell phase I found that I had to think far too much about laziness versus strictness and space leaks, and I ended up writing code full of strictness annotations to get around this. Yet at the same time Haskell provides a certain power and way of thinking that very few other languages do. So what I am wondering is whether there are any languages like Haskell out there that provide both laziness and strictness, but instead of laziness being the default, strictness is instead. Sure, strict-by-default makes it harder to implement things such as infinite lists and foldr, but that seems to be a small loss compared to not having to worry about exhausting one's RAM because one forgot to put a ! somewhere.

 (require 'desktop)
 (desktop-save-mode 1)
 (setq desktop-dirname "~/.config/emacs/desktop/"
 desktop-base-file-name "emacs.desktop"
 desktop-base-lock-name "lock"
 desktop-path (list desktop-dirname)
 desktop-save t

 desktop-load-locked-desktop t
 desktop-auto-save-timeout 60)
 This code doesn't work as expected, I don't get my previous session with opened buffers, tabs etc. I want a solution which will work with emacs daemon, I want to save the whole state of my emacs, and load it on startup automatically(all my opened tabs, buffers, workspaces), if my system failed(crashed or somethings like this). What is the best solution for this kind of stuff? Is there ready for use configuration/package for this? Please, let me know, it is impossible to work without this feature. I use emacs29-pgtk with doom emacs, also I still don't use emacs daemon, I am just planning to get it working on my systems.

When I type ctrl-h k esc k, emacs's help buffer says "M-k (translated from <escape> k) runs the command kill-sentence ...". It is obvious that in my setup, emacs can distinguish the difference between alt pressed with a key and escape followed by a key press, but how does one unlink esc and alt. That is, bind a different command to alt-somekey than to esc somekey. From the message in the help buffer -- "... (translated from <escape> k) ..." --, I suspect that I need to turn off some kind of translation function.

 As I was working in org, I left my emacs session to wander around online for a while. When I returned to emacs, an autocomplete drop-down had appeared, including some of the options in the window above (I then typed __ to see more). These templates look very useful, especially if I can configure them, but I'm not able to figure out what they're called and haven't been able to find the documentation -- or even figure out how to reliably use the templates!
 Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/emacs,
 I submitted a package scala-repl into MELPA. It provides REPL driven development experience for Scala.
 It automatically detects the project root by simply searching for build.sbt or build.sc files in the current folder and its ancestors, till the root folder. When nothing is found, it will simply invoke scala-cli. The command to run when a project is (not) found is configurable.
 I have been using it myself for multiple weeks and am pretty satisfied with it.
 You are more than welcome to try it out and comment out any issues. :-)
 P.S. One thing I have not yet achieved is the ability to hot-reload the application like Common Lisp SLIME/SLY. But it is probably restricted by the limitations of Scala console instead of Emacs...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many note-taking apps like Obsidian provide the graph view functionality to visualize the relation of notes. But this kind of graph view only bases on linkages/references(incoming links and outgoing links) between notes. It is hard to recognize a specific long COT(chain of thoughts)——the starting point, the path and the end. Different COTs crossing in the graph view makes it more chaotic.
Luhmann's zettelkasten is a "combination of disorder and order, of clustering and unpredictable combinations emerging from ad hoc selection."
The graph view(generated by linkages/references) in some ways can represent the aspect of disorder of a zettelkasten. But what is the aspect of order?
"The absence of a fixed system of order and, in consequence, a table of contents turned the index into the key tool for using the file – how else should one be able to find certain notes again and thus gain access to the system of references? Not wanting to rely on pure chance requires being able to identify at least one point from which the respective web of references can be accessed. This is the purpose of the keyword index."
Base on my understanding, the aspect of order in Luhmann's zettelkasten is composed of his note IDs and keyword index(register).
As so far, I don't find any note-taking apps provide the graph view functionality basing on Luhmann-style IDs and his keyword index——And this is why I created a new Obsidian plugin "zettelkasten navigation" recently. I think this plugin , in some ways, represents the real Luhmann way to retrive thoughts and navigate notes in a digital zettelkasten. The other note-taking apps should provide the similar functionality as well in future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent a lot of time reading and thinking about if I want to learn Emacs or Vim since they have very high learning curves, I went with Vim because I had been looking a way to better edit text. Vim's modal editing is very powerful, allowing me to make lots of changes to text with only a handful of keystrokes. I wonder if that's why most Vim and Neovim users chose it over Emacs and if that's why Vim is much more popular than Emacs.
 Emacs is a modeless editor and you need a third party emulation like Evil mode for modal editing, but that's not full Vim. You wouldn't be able to install Vim or Neovim plugin, especially ones that extend its modal editing capabilities like the Vim surround plugin. Perhaps it might be possible to use the headless Neovim backend for text editing in Emacs, like the VS Code Neovim extension or Firenvim Firefox addon does, but why do that when you could just use Neovim?
 I think that all the extensibility Emacs has to make it essentially an app platform alone isn't something that appeals to a lot of users, but what if Emacs had modal editing as good as Vi / Vim's from the start? It seems like Vi Vim and even Neovim never had the level of extensibility as Emacs does, so what if it was a matter of picking between a modal editor, and a modal editor with lots of extensibility? (an oversimplified hypothetical comparison but still).
 And by the way, what was the rationale for the decision of Emacs to be a modeless editor rather than a modal editor?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I started to create my config files for emacs (init.el) and qtile (config.py) with org-babel-tangle.
 The goal is to have a single .org file to tangle multiple output files for multiple systems. The systems have some varying configurations and variables set.
 I started using :noweb successfully so that I can specify codeblocks for pc1, pc2 and common blocks for all.
 But that leads to duplicates.
 What I want to achieve is that I can create a "template" code block where, depending what system the output is created for, other variables are used.
 #+begin_src python :noweb yes <<pc1>> #+end_src #+begin_src python :noweb yes <<pc2>> #+end_src #+name: variables-pc1 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :var key="" (setq variables '(("mod" . "mod4") ("myTerm" . "alacritty") ("myBrowser" . "firefox") ("myExplorer" . "pcmanfm"))) (cdr (assoc key variables)) #+end_src #+name: variables-pc2 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :var key="" (setq variables '(("mod" . "mod4") ("myTerm" . "alacritty") ("myBrowser" . "chromium") ("myExplorer" . "pcmanfm"))) (cdr (assoc key variables)) #+end_src #+begin_src python test print("<<variable>>."myBrowser">>") #+end_src 
 The block "test" should be tangled with "firefox" for pc1 and "chromium" for pc2.
 Is that possible? 
 Many thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I'm designing a pure FP language similar to... Python :) At least in the spirit of its Zen: "one and preferably only one obvious way to do it", "simple is better than complex", "readability counts" etc, otherwise similar to Haskell (or PureScript even closer now) in semantics. It's just a specification for fun and I don't think it'll ever get to implementation, so below question is purely curiosity-driven you can unleash your imagination if you want.
 So, if you had a chance to embed an effect system in a modern FP language to avoid any boilerplate, syntax quirks and perhaps performance penalties or at least ship it in a stdlib, how would the system look like? Haskell has plenty of options implemented as libraries - I want to avoid this galore given the "one way" mantra. May it could be one of those libraries like polysemy, but as part of language spec? Maybe algebraic effects similar to what Unison has (I'm all for preserving referential transparency), maybe RIO (or thinking of Scala counterpart ZIO) as part of stdlib?

 I could reason that it limits "hackability", but a lot of "--" functions really are useless outside of their package, and the advice system could be used to inject extra code if a hacker really wanted to, I think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can download binaries for this pre-release from: Release rc/v2.15.6.3 (release candidate) · commercialhaskell/stack · GitHub.
 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version soon, as the changes are made to allow a released version of Stack to build with the coming GHC 9.10.
 Release notes:
  
This release fixes potential bugs.
 The hash that Stack uses to distinguish one build plan from another has changed for plans that set (as opposed to unset) manually Cabal flags for immutable dependencies. This will cause Stack to rebuild dependencies for such plans.
  
Changes since v2.15.6.1:
 Bug fixes:
  
The hashes that Stack uses to distinguish one build plan from another now include the Cabal flags for immutable dependencies set manually. Previously, in error, only such flags that were unset manually were included.

 Hi, I recently tried to transition my entire organization to Emacs, but I'm encountering difficulties. I attempted to install Emacs and Org Mode using Homebrew --cask emacs and emacsformacosx, but encountered an error. So, I followed the tutorial on https://josephdubon.com/blog/how-to-install-doom-emacs-macbook-pro-2023, and it worked, but I don't want Doom, I only want Emacs and Org Mode. How can I achieve this? (I want to emphasize that I specifically need Emacs because I want to follow Reiner's Udemy course.) Please help me :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I met my husband 10 yrs ago, he was everything I ever wanted. We met on a freenode IRC channel. He was a Gentoo and Linux-from-scratch dual-booter who could install both systems with his eyes closed. We used to have long, romantic conversations well past midnight about tabs vs spaces and open source. Our first fight ever was about MIT vs GPL licensing. On our first date, we shared our tiling manager config files with each other (this was the first time I truly felt love for a man).
 However, lately he’s changed into a husk of the man he used to be. He migrated to Linux Mint, because, and I quote, he “just wants to get work done” and he “no longer has time to fiddle with [his] system”. Then, he started using GNOME for the same reason. This was already very suspicious. I mean, if he truly just wanted to start using a full DE, he could have at least picked KDE, right? Even Xfce I’d have been ok with.
 Then, the other day, our relationship hit a breaking point. Here I was, working on my 2012 NixOS thinkpad, and hubby calls me over to his office. He said he “wanted to show me something”. I sit down on his chair, and you can imagine my terror as he pulls up vim on his terminal. He had a weird smile on his face, as if something had taken him over. He spent the next few mins “showing off” a variety of vim tricks he’d just learned. I had to turn my face to the side so he wouldn’t see the tears drying on my cheeks. Let me be clear: This was NOT the man I married.
 Our relationship has had its ups and downs, but I never imagined my husband would stoop so low as to become a vim peasant. I don’t know what to do. Part me says I should just start divorce proceedings and get it over with, but the other part can’t help but wonder if perhaps my husband is being afflicted by some serious, undiagnosed mental illness.
 Please advise reddit, my whole life is in shambles and I don’t know what to do

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks, in Vim, there is a basic feature called "autoindent". Basically, if you start a new line, it'll automatically insert whatever indentation level found in the last line. For example (cursor shown as |):
 def foo(): doSomething()| 
 then you press enter:
 def foo(): doSomething() | 
 the cursor will have the same indent level as the previous line.
 I'm wondering if Emacs has the same functionality.
 EDIT: my workaround:
 (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local indent-line-function #'indent-relative))) (keymap-global-set "<TAB>" 'tab-to-tab-stop) (keymap-global-set "M-i" 'indent-for-tab-command)

 What kinds of actions and arguments are you expecting to see? I've implemented a few, but renaming is painless until people start writing documents.
 You can of course load the package. If you also install Master of Ceremonies (you will probably enjoy mc-focus) you can complete the entire demo.
 Expect nothing to be stable. I haven't put this on a package archive yet. It's just neat and will be very beneficial to the ecosystem.
 Ask questions. Tell me your expectations.

 After some years of not programming Scala professionally, I am revisiting an old Scala code base that is using Scalajpa. I am not a fan of either JPA or Hibernate, so I would like to replace Scalajpa with something else.
 My previous experience with an ORM-library in the Scala space was Slick, and I was not very pleased with the complexity and syntax.
 Can you recommend a simple Scala ORM? Or should I look into a Java library like jooq?

 warning: [-Wincomplete-patterns] Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive In an equation for ‘mymerge’: Patterns of type ‘[a]’, ‘[a]’ not matched: (_:_) (_:_) | 22 | mymerge xs [] = xs | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^... 
 And when I do run it I get bizarre output, although the right answer
 *** Parser [source]: !!! Parser [source]: finished in 0.14 milliseconds, allocated 0.053 megabytes *** Desugar: *** Simplify [expr]: !!!

 Any ideas what's happening here?

 I usually manage getting my way around but it's been hours it seems to not be working for me this time.
 I'm trying to set this theme :

 its seems to work but the colors are completely off, everything is grey to black.
 Does anyone know if I may have previous theme config that may cause this ? 
 Thank you very much.

 * Foo
 ** Bar
 *** Baz
 The asterisks have to start in the first column.
 It strikes me (especially with org auto indent on) it might be handy to be able to write: (underscore == space, cause reddit)
 * Foo
 ___** Bar
 ______*** Baz
 ie: Make the leading whitespace not relevent
 Now, I'm just being lazy, not wanting to wipe auto-indented spaces while int he typing flow and just entering headlines
 Another option might be a minor mode that detects 'hey we're in org-mode, and that looks like a headline with leading asterisks, lets blow away the whitespace for ya!'; wouldn't be too hard a function to write.
 A function like tht could get goofy, if you're doing say embedded a BEGIN_SRC block with C code in it, with multiline comments, but a function could check if its looking within such a block..
 Anyone considered this sort of thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to pass nearly all printed output from (in this case, Python) code blocks through a function that (which usually is formatting, in other cases is some mathematical operation) I've defined previously.
 I think what I want is to use #+call or the :post header argument, but I'm not sure how.
 I think I need either a version of this:
 #+name: my_function #+begin_src python :var data=0 my_function(data) #+end_src #+name: my_data #+begin_src python :post my_function(data) x=2+2 print(x) #+end_src

 #+name: my_function #+begin_src python :var data=0 my_function(data) #+end_src #+name: my_data #+begin_src python x=2+2 print(x) #+end_src #+call: my_function(my_data) :results drawer 
 so that in both cases, I would have the my_function(my_output) evaluated and displayed in the buffer.
 I can't quite get this to work -- does anyone see what I'm missing? I'm also using a Python :session my-session argument, which is located in the Org header for the file, so that I don't have to keep adding the :session.

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I'd love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
I'm still interested in connecting via Zoom for a chat if you want.
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK and why I'm here:
I'm wrapping up the final project for this term. Once done, I'm going to hit the #proofing section of my zettelkasten. I'm shifting my focus from reading to writing in the fall term.
Food Reading - I've enjoyed a run of foodie books. They are starting to get under my skin in a good way.
Samu Practice is something I've done for 15 years without much reflection. I'm changing that.
Books I'm reading:

 The reason of this is for give to emacs a feel more modern for this decade in comparation to others editors and rivals such as vscode or neovim, about this also for give to that release as the begin of a new and great era for emacs and its community e.g the inclusion of tree-siter, eglot, the work in progress of the new GC, the new json parser, new and great packages, &.c.
 I've done some conceptual icons in case there are interest in this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just wanted to share my emacs-config that I've been using for a while and just recently pushed to GitHub. I've updated the config to use org-mode which then optionally tangles the code (I used to use auto-tangle but have turned that off).
 One of the great things about this config is that most of the packages are deferred. Startup time on my M2 Mac is around 1.5 seconds which I find pretty good.
 Something of note - a lot of inspiration of this came from two sources:
  
System Crafters (Emacs from Scratch)
 A guy name Portesilaos that has some great content.
  
My hope is that someone can find some use out of it.

 The first doesn't work due to the macro and the second is operating in the global namespace and not on the lexically bound local variables.
 Edit version of the question: can I have lexical binding and go from string to corresponding symbol somehow or am I stuck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe you dont like it but that's fine, it is just an idea as of now as someone who is using emacs just for orgmode for years and recently started to use dired. I'm sorry not using it for more than those 2 things, please have mercy with me. 
 So back to my idea. That email "client", well actually it is just a viewer, the receiving and sending part would have to be done with offlineimap, sendmail and friends:
  
there are different orgmode files, e.g. ~/org/mail/inbox.org, ~/org/mail/sent.org, ~/org/mail/drafts.org and all of them contain headlines which actually are emails, but they are just rendered as headlines.
 The headline includes the subject, but could also include some state such as READ or SENT
 The body is the text of the email
 Attachments? Use org attachment to add them
 Maybe we could also use properties for recipients or use the tags, I'm unsure about this one 
 a scheduler would iterate over those files every few minutes/hours and actually sends that email (headline) 
 you can archive an email, which would actually just refile it, or you could also move things around like refiling
 I don't know if you can partially set some parts of the buffer to be read only, I don't know if it would make sense to set all those files to be read only, hmm
 use org capture templates to write a new email, depending on the cursor position it would either be a reply or new mail

 First of all, I have zero treesitter packages installed on my system, nor is it part of my config, grepping my system, I only find treesitter files associated with neovim. Nothing in /usr or ~/.config/emacs
 What is happening here ?
 I am open for any pointers, or tips, or insights.

Overview
This is a retrospective of my and many other people’s work on documentation in the Nix ecosystem between October 2022 and March 2024.
It serves as a showcase of what we achieved together, and gives an impression of what’s involved in improving the user experience in a complex software system.
A lot has happened during that time, so this text is quite lengthy.
The details of this report will mainly be interesting to power users and active contributors, or people working on software projects that are in a similar situation as Nix.

 The default window size increases as I add more stuff to the agenda. I work on a laptop with limited display real estate and, at times, the agenda window consumes virtually the entire Org-Mode view, covering virtually all of the tasks I'm working on.
 I manually resize it when I need to. However, it would be better if the agenda consumed no more than 50% of the available Org-Mode real estate.
 I've been trying to find a setting to configure to limit the agenda's vertical height to no more than 50% of the available window space. That is, the top half of the Org window would contain my tasks, and the bottom half would contain my agenda.
 Is this possible?

 Is there some setting I have to set to make it search the whole project? Or some extra p[ackage to install?
 If not can someone suggest what the latest present day tags/package is. I am using etags and that seems kind of creaky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I just got back into dev mode for a few days for the job and I just noticed that narrowing with consult-imenu does not seem to work on my setup (see below). Tested with a Python code base and a C code base. In other consult cases, the narrowing feature works perfectly (consult-buffer, consult-org, consult-flymake). I don't know since when it does not work for consult-imenu because I discovered the narrowing feature in consult only a few months ago, and only got the opportunity to try the feature on a code base/consult-imenu since yesterday. Anyone else is having this behavior ?
 I can open an issue on Github if needed. I didn't do it yet because the code for consult-imenu has not changed for 4 months, and since I could not find any complaint about this, I suspect it might be related to my personal setup. So I wanted to probe the community first before bothering minad.
 My setup
  
Emacs 29.3, compiled by myself
 consult version 20240420.929, from Melpa
  
The steps to reproduce the issue
  
open a Python or C file in Emacs, with a lot of functions and variable
 hit M-x consult-imenu
 a nice, searchable, consult prompt shows up with all the functions/modules/variable tagged appropriately
 hit the narrow key (< in my case)
  
Expected result
 There should be either a which-key frame showing the next key to type, or, if I'm quick enough, either I should be able to type f, and according to the consult-imenu code, it should filter on the functions only.
 Actual result
 < or <f are taken literally, like a conventional search pattern.

((backup-inhibited . t)) ))  but when I open emacs it asks me if I want to apply that setting as it is not considered a safe local variable. Is there a safe way to achieve this. I guess I could make backup-inhibited a safe local variable, but I'm concerned whether this will lead to security issues. What's the safest way to disable backups within a directory?

I'll explain why. Every other programming language forces the programmer to keep track of time in order to read and write the code. There is a notion of when things happen that needs to be considered, and this often makes it hard to re-use code and leads to unexpected interactions. Haskell code, on the other hand, requires no notion of time. Haskell code is tenseless, inert. Haskell code doesn't do things. Haskell code merely means things. That made it easier to learn, read, and write than other languages like Java or even Python and Javascript."
 This is the link to the comment -> https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/s/uhjWTq0rRb
 I was curious if there's any resource that helps you learn haskell the same way the commentor learned. Or if there's some blog posts which teaches you how to look at Haskell language similar to the commentators perspective

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I'm a new-ish Emacs user (~1 year) and I've just started using the emacs-jupyter package for writing Python code. I used to write (too many) jupyter notebooks with VSCode but I find that I can organize my code & notes better with org documents and just simple Python files. I started using emacs-jupyter after reading Martí Bosch's blog on the topic. My current workflow is just opening up a python file (or write a new one), then running `jupyter-run-repl` and then `jupyter-repl-associate-buffer`. Then I do execute a region or execute line-by-line via `jupyter-eval-line-or-region` bound to `C-c C-c`. The thing with this workflow is that the jupyter REPL gets quite long as I'm tweaking little things about the graphs or visualization I'm working on. Is there a better workflow that people use for doing this kind of work? I also can't find a way to clear the jupyter REPL that I'm working on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I found some users of our app where getting issues, and it seemed to be because libpq was throwing exceptions when database connections were dropping out. I did try to investigate the cause of these dropouts, and I changed some connection pool settings I thought were a bit funky, but then I realised no matter what I can do, database connections CAN drop out. Temporary network outages, whatever, the real world isn't perfect.
 So instead of just letting this exception just bubble up, I should be catching and retrying. 
 So then I got reading about runtime exceptions in Haskell. And I found there are broadly two categories:
  
Asynchronous
 Synchronous
  
Asynchronous come from other threads, and you don't want to catch and retry those. These are like another thread asking you to fin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I have this code (it is an adaptation of gnus-delay.el for working with notmuch) that sets up some timer (like "every 5 minutes") that then chains an idle timer. The attempted result is "every 5 minutes, then when idle for 30 seconds; rinse and repeat".
 (defvar notmuch-delay-timer-scheduled nil "The current timer for the scheduled run.") (defvar notmuch-delay-timer-idle nil "The current timer for the idle run.") (defun notmuch-delay-scheduled-runner () (unless (memq notmuch-delay-timer-idle timer-idle-list) (setq notmuch-delay-timer-idle (run-with-idle-timer 30 nil #'notmuch-delay-send-queue)))) ;;;###autoload (defun notmuch-delay-initialize () (unless (memq notmuch-delay-timer-scheduled timer-list) (setq notmuch-delay-timer-scheduled (run-at-time t 300 #'notmuch-delay-scheduled-runner)))) 
 The code works. But I can't remove the feeling that there must be a much nicer way to do this properly or more Lispy.
 I would imagine I could use one single var with `car` and `cdr` thus having both timers there; but that's still two timers and two functions.
 Any ideas?
 Chaining the idle timer after the scheduled one is to make sure that I am not working in Emacs when notmuch-delay-send-queue is called.

I have recently sent an email to help-gnu-emacs, which I am not subscribed to, and received replies judging by the mailing list archive but those replies never landed in my inbox. Is the mailing list etiquette not to reply to the person specifically but only to the mailing list? This makes little sense to me since non-subscribing users would miss emails in this case, but I have also checked that I am able to receive emails at the address that I used. Now I would like to reply back, and I am thinking of replying using the mailing list archive. Is there something I should do to ensure that I receive the replies in my inbox?

 Here's an app I wrote for myself and have been using for some time .. and with some encouragement decided to clean up and release for anyone else who might find it useful. 
 It's a windows task switcher with first class support for search, and much more responsive and feature-rich than the windows default.
 Its built with Rust and Tauri for backend, and uses direct ScalaJS for frontend w no other framework.
 Repo is https://github.com/yakrider/switche/
 The Readme there has all the necessary info to 'git gud' with it, incl configuring hotkeys and features. 
 Screenshot of this first-ever-released version 2.2.7 is below. 
 Try it out and hopefully it might be useful for some of ya'll. 
 I'm happy to field bug reports, questions, concerns, feedback of any kind.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do now know Haskell (I somehow managed to avoid it at university, and my favorite language is C).
 But I want to use sv2v (A System Verilog to Verilog translator), which is written in Haskell. The Makefile uses Haskell Stack. I've tried on three Debian GNU/Linux testing systems:
  
amd64 - works fine.
 arm64 - ran into issues not obvious to a non-Haskell user https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v/issues/282
 ppc64 - ran into issues not obvious to a non-Haskell user https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v/issues/283
  
I don't tend to see such problem with programs written in C - for a simple program, I just use the C compiler on whatever system I want to compile the C program on and that's it; for more complex programs people tend to ship a configure script that works (or tells me what to install if a dependency is missing).
 Now I wonder if the issues I saw are sv2v-specific, or a wider protability problem with programs written in Haskell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The whole concept of "emacs as an operating system", i.e. building applications like org-mode inside the editor, and using regular editor text buffers as the software interface is super interesting to me.
 I think this might be the direction I want to go in for a lot of custom personal software that I build for myself.
 So I'd like to learn a little more about the subject, but I'm struggling to find the right terminology to search the web for.
 I'm not an emacs user currently, I only ever tinkered with it for a few hours to try out org-mode many many years ago. So this probably doesn't help.
  
Some questions:
  
1) Are there any commonly used concise terms around this whole "editor as an application interface" concept in general? 
 ...it could be either specific to emacs, or more broadly for other editors too.
 
e.g. We have some pretty common terms like "CLI, TUI, GUI, desktop-app, web-based, mobile-app" etc that are used to quite clearly denote the all the common interfaces...
 So I'm hoping there's some easily-Google-searchable short term for this stuff too?
 
 2) If you know of any specific guides/learning resources on the topic, please share a link (or name I can search).
 3) I'm guessing that emacs is the #1 GOAT when it comes to how well it can do this stuff? But curious what other editors can also do this, and how they compare in abilities?
 4) Amongst the variants of emacs, which is best for this? For my use case it needs to work just as well on Windows as Linux.
 5) Also feel free to share any personal anecdotes on what discovering this paradigm meant to you personally. 
 Including where you've seen big improvements in usability/efficiency etc
 And maybe also were there any specific use cases where you over-estimated how useful it would be? And you went back to the mainstream types of interface for something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm working on learning Haskell for personal enrichment. I already know OCaml rather well and use it for personal projects, so Haskell comes fairly easily. (except those compiler messages are brutal for newbs)
 However, there is kind of an uncanny valley for me between the Haskell one learns in tutorials and the Haskell (and GHC tricks) one is actually supposed to use to write software. Some examples:
  
Don't actually use String, use ByteString
 In fact don't use lists at all when performance counts.
 Except obviously for iteration, when fusion is applicable. 
 which, I don't know when that is.
 
 sprinkle around strictness annotations and seq liberally. 
 also not really sure when to do that.
 
 Of course if you are doing X, you will definitely use pragma Y.
  
I'm also interested to find out about the 3rd-party libraries "everyone" uses. e.g. in Python, requests is more or less the "standard" http client, rather than the one in the standard library. In OCaml, you use the Re package for regex, never the Str module in the standard library because it's not thread safe and is super stateful.
 I wish to know these kinds of things that "real" Haskell programmers know. Got any relevant links?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who don't know what I'm talking about, I don't blame you. It's basically only referenced in this talk by Odersky from ScalaDays and random discussion threads scattered that only reference that talk. It mentions a new research project on algebraic effects called Caprese (Capabilities for Resources and Effects). 
 I was confused about the discourse around this project because some people have stated that it's already making its way into scala 3, but I haven't seen any kind of technical details, documentation, talks, or anything else I would expect from what appears to some to be a big change for the language. 
 Honestly I'm mostly just excited and want to know more. Especially since a lot of people I respect seem to see this as a possible avenue for resolving some of the bigger issues with scala like fragmentation/effort duplication and the poor ergonomics and high skill barrier of IO and tagless final. 
 Anyone have any good articles or resources that actually dive into the topic more and explore how it could affect library design in the future?

 Have you tried "center" the minibuffer output, so your eyes don't have to travel to the bottom corner every time you invoke an interactive command?
 I know this is very much about ergonomics and work positions too ... but still wondered enough to ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a very weird vim workflow and would love to port it to emacs, org in particular. I had my emacs phase but am a strong vim user for plenty of years.
 For less distraction, I use a Windows 7 laptop at home, while I use a modern Linux one for work. I manage all my TODOs and Notes via vim on a server that I can access from both via ssh/mosh.
 I have plenty of vim tabs per instance, and several instances. All in a named tmux session that I can attach/unattach everytime I want to read it, so that I never have to actually reopen them. I thus have "built a GUI" by permanently using the same tmux splits.
 How would I do this in emacs (tui)? - I know that remote editing would usually be done via TRAMP, but I really want to keep the window open on the server. - Emacs within tmux is clunky because of overlapping bindings and nested terminal emulation. - I am confused on the differences of emacs server vs emacs daemon?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently testing gnus over mu4e for my mail needs in emacs and am liking it a lot so far. One thing i'm trying to work out though, is how i can make the article summary a bit easier to parse. Two things i'm looking for:
  
There seem to be three "Date" options. "%D" as the date from the header, "%d" as an Article Date with only Month and day, and "%o" as the article Date in a long unseparated format. Is there any option to get a custom date format in there? %D is super verbose, including also timezone and such. "%o" is hard to parse as a non-separated string. "%d" is not enough granularity
 Can individual parts of the summary line be bolded or italizised? I'm looking to have the From Adress in Bold to better find it. If that's not possible, i guess i have to work with fixed width "blocks" to make it somewhat into a table.
  
Any other great tips for a gnus "newcomer" that you found to be valuable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After getting some useful tips about using clock tables for my time reporting needs I've setup everything and basically it works pretty fine. My only problem is that the table shows the full hierarchy to a task.
 so if I have something like this:
 * Administration ** Meetings *** Weekly meetings :LOGBOOK: * Specification ** WIP *** Tasks **** Task 1 :LOGBOOK: **** Task 2 :LOGBOOK: 
 When I now create a clock table It would look like this (this is the compact view):
 | Headline | Time | |-------------------------------+--------| | *Total time* | *3:20* | |-------------------------------+--------| | Administration | 0:32 | | \_ Meetings | 0:32 | | \_ Weekly Meetings | 0:32 | | Specification | 2:48 | | \_ WIP | 2:48 | | \_ Tasks | 2:48 | | \_ Task 1 | 1:35 | | \_ Task 2 | 1:13 | 
 What I would prefer is something like this
 | Headline | Time | |-------------------------------+--------| | *Total time* | *3:20* | |-------------------------------+--------| | Weekly Meetings | 0:32 | | Task 1 | 1:35 | | Task 2 | 1:13 | 
 How could I do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am going through the Emacs Lisp Intro manual to consolidate my Elisp knowledge. In the "More Complex" section, the function "copy-to-buffer" is suggested as a case study. I will include it here for your reference:
 (defun copy-to-buffer (buffer start end) "Copy to specified BUFFER the text of the region." (interactive "BCopy to buffer: \nr") (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer))) (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer) (barf-if-buffer-read-only) (erase-buffer) (save-excursion (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end))))) 
 Perhaps I do not understand well how the save-excursion works. But, since we are setting temporarily the current buffer to the "buffer" argument by using the "with-current-buffer", and we are erasing its contents with "erase-buffer", why do we use "save-excursion"?
 After we use "erase-buffer" don't we get point, point-min and point-max set to 1?
 It seems to me that it is just redundant to save the excursion inside the empty buffer when all the points have the value 1. Then why do we do that?
 Thank you very much.
 EDIT: I think that I understand the reason of save-excursion in this case. It is a user-friendly feature. It ensures that after pasting the text in the empty buffer, the point is set back to the value 1. I guess it is a just to avoid confusing the user by having the point set to point-max. When the user switches to the buffer where the selection was pasted, the users will see the beginning of the buffer instead of the end. Please feel free to correct me if you have a better explanation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Previously I had Java working with lsp-mode. Experimenting with tree-sitter recently has caused this to break.
 I'm using Emacs 29.2 on a Mac.
 My lsp-mode config is very basic:
 (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-lens-mode) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration) :config (setq lsp-prefer-flymake nil lsp-client-packages '(lsp-clients lsp-metals))) 
 And lsp-java:
 (use-package lsp-java :ensure t :init :config (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'lsp) (add-hook 'java-ts-mode-hook 'lsp) (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(java-ts-mode . "java"))) 
 However, when I open a Java file I get:
  
LSP :: There are no language servers supporting current mode java-ts-mode' registered withlsp-mode'.
  
Clearly the major mode is different with tree-sitter, it's now 'java-ts-mode'. Looking in lsp-java.el though, I do see this in the 'lsp-register-client' function:
  :major-modes '(java-mode java-ts-mode jdee-mode) 
 There is obviously something else I'm missing. Any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have this compile function to open the compile in a smaller size, and if i run again the C-c C-c it closes:
 (defun my-compile () (interactive) (let* ((current-window (selected-window)) (compile-buffer (get-buffer-create "*compilation*")) (compile-buffer-window (get-buffer-window compile-buffer))) (if compile-buffer-window (progn (delete-window compile-buffer-window) (kill-buffer compile-buffer)) (let* ((compile-window-height (/ (window-total-height) 4)) (compile-command (read-from-minibuffer "Compile command: "))) (select-window (split-window-below (- compile-window-height))) (switch-to-buffer compile-buffer) (select-window current-window) (compile compile-command))))) (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c") 'my-compile) 
 However, when I'm in a python file, this bind doesn't run correctly: python-shell-get-process-or-error: Start a Python process first with M-x run-python or ‘C-c C-p’
 But if I run the default emacs compile: M-x compile It works correctly, why? Is there a way to make this function of mine behave the same way as the native emacs compile? I like how it turned out because it doesn't open a large buffer and it makes it much easier when I want to run a file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[View PDF with intact image, but want dark mode(text and background inverted)
 This is possible in some pdf reader like acrobat
 aim : pdf tools night mode NOT inverting image
 trouble shoot : 3 options were availiable by tweaking variables
 1st : no night mode
 2nd : night mode, invert image(chromatic image)
 3rd : night mode, invert image(monotnous image)
 since 2nd 3rd option's difference is only on images
 It may be possible to not invert image.

 I am using a eshell as primary shell (for years…). But suddenly one thing starts to irritate me, that when pressing up or down, it lists the history of commands. I want to disable it (and use arrows for moving in the buffer), so I tried:

 But somehow it's not working. The original behavior remains....
 What is the trick then?

 λ> :t foldl foldl :: Foldable t => (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b 
 I see it takes three arguments, the first is a function, the second the accumulator, and the third a list. Then the result is of type b. Could someone decipher, first, why the function uses two type variables a and b? If the function is binary commutative addition (+), why can't the description just be (a -> a -> a)? And the accumulator is type b, again, why not just type a? And what is being indicated by t a? The Foldable t means t must be a type for which Foldable has an instance. Again, why this t a notation?

For example, I tried to change the background color of the PROJ heading, but it does not seem to change no matter what. I also tried running the svg-lib-demo.org, but it did not change the colors.
 ;; TODO / DONE ("TODO" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make "TODO" :face 'org-todo :inverse t :margin 0)))) ("NEXT" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make "NEXT" :face 'org-todo :inverse t :margin 0)))) ("PROJ" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make "PROJ" :inverse t :margin 0 :foreground "#0FF000" :background "#FF5733")))) 
 I also noticed that the text in the icons is a little above and not centered. I was wondering if anyone had been able to figure out how to correct this in vanilla emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was presented with Haskell in this semester (I'm in the second semester of college). It was functional paradigma time to learn. All my friends hate it. At first, I didn't like it too. I found it weird, since the first language that I had contact with was C and it is much different from Haskell. Besides, my teacher wasn't a good professor, so this made things worse. But instead of saying that this language is useless, I decided to give it a chance, since there might be a reason I'm supposed to learn it. After that, I end up enjoying Haskell and started viewing it as a new tool and a different approach to solve problems. I told my friends that I would continue to learn Haskell and read books about it during vacation time, and they laughed at me, told me that it is useless, that I'm just wasting my time, that Haskell has no real life application and that I should learn Java if I wanna get a job (we'll learn Java next semester). I felt discouraged because I DO wanna get a job. My mom works very hard so I can only study, and I want as soon as I can be able to financially help her (or at least help her a bit). What I am asking is if learning Haskell will help me in the future somehow or am I just being naive?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can download binaries for this pre-release from: Release rc/v2.15.6.1 · commercialhaskell/stack · GitHub.
 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version soon, as the changes are made to allow a released version of Stack to build with the coming GHC 9.10.
 Release notes:
  
This release fixes potential bugs.
  
Changes since v2.15.5:
 Major changes: 
  
Stack 2.15.5 and earlier cannot build with Cabal (the library) version 3.12.0.0. Stack can now build with that Cabal version.
  
Behaviour changes: 
  
Stack’s StackSetupShim executable, when called with repl and stack-initial-build-steps, no longer uses Cabal’s replHook to apply initialBuildSteps but takes a more direct approach.
  
Bug fixes:
  
Fix a regression introduced in Stack 2.15.1 that caused a ‘no operation’ stack build to be slower than previously.

 The two images are before on the left vs afterwards on the right.
 Note the constructors, methods, inner classes are placed as items under the class. I also discovered the builtin rules misclassified enums nodetype and fixed that as well. Finally, although I normally adjust the faces to all black/gray I've left it at the default to highlight something odd about the treesitter node creation code. Based on some unknown code path about half the time the node names come with the original properties including faces and the rest of the time they are plain text.
 Some sample in progress code.

Like Meetings, coding feature x, writing documentation, ... On the other hand my employer has a project which is just assigned to the project I do for the customer. So it is basically a hierarchy with two levels:
 * TODO employer project ** TODO customer Meetings ** TODO customer Coding ** TODO customer Documenting 
 So at the end of the day I need to tell the customer the more granular times and the employer the overall times.
 What I want to have is a feature where I clock in on the customer todos but can also see a daily aggregation on the employer todo. How could I do that in org mode?
 It would be also awesome if I could have the customer todos in a different file and just "backlink" them to the employer todo which is in its own separate file

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm hoping you might be able to help me out with this. My sister was diagnosed with a progressive auto-immune disease not to long ago. To simplify things, she has started to develop arthritis-like symptoms that will get progressively worse, and she will lose her vision over time. 
 She's not very technical, but I know there are a lot of interesting ergonomics modes like xah-fly-keys, or even just spacemacs style bindings with a leader key. I'd love some recommendations for relatively easy to learn ergonomics systems that might be less intimidating to newer users. Right now I'm leaning towards spacemacs because that seems the easiest way for someone who would probably be pretty put off by editing an init.el right out of the gate. 
 I also thought that over time she could augment this with speech to text as well as text to speech. I know that there are a number of emacs tools like emacsspeak, but I remember seeing a video on youtube where someone had some hooks into a google text to speech library, and was using ai to send audio clips to chat gpt.If that rings a bell for anyone, please let me know what they were using. I haven't been able to find it, but I'd love any other recommendations or thoughts there as well. 
 Anyway, thanks in advance!

I feel like there is a big need for Kafka/Data Engineering in general, and I’ll be using Scala for Spark in my new role. Do you use Scala to anything besides Kafka/Spark?

 Last question, 
 if you were to become a scala developer now, would you invest much time into quirks and features of scala, or would you spend more time to become a badass data engineer with more tools (pyspark, cloud, kubernetes, kafka [architecture wise])

My only issue is, if I try to "go to definition" of one of the builtin classes or the ones that are provided from maven, it doesn't go there as expected. For instance, `import picocli.CommandLine.Command` if the cursor is on Command and I try to go to definition, it just doesn't go there and the minibuffer highlights the Command part for a second. The same thing for the java builtin methods. such as System.out.println. Is there a way to make them work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! 
 I've had this bug for some time now, this is what I've got:
 symptom: in the shell, when asked for password, prompt shows in minibuffer, then quits a second or two later (while I'm typing said password) leading to only the later half of my password being typed in clear text. 
 comint-watch-for-password-prompt runs comint-send-invisible in a (run-at-time 0 nil ...). If I replace run-at-time by the lambda content it is supposed to run, no more bug. If I replace 0 by 1 or 0.1, no more bug either. For values under 0.01 bug is back.
 If I add "lol" at the end of comint-watch-for-password-prompt, so that run-at-time's cancelable timer is not returned to the caller, the bug still happens, so... it's not quitting because somebody is canceling the timer. 
 So, what do I with this? 
 for reference, here is the function I'm talking about:
 (defun comint-watch-for-password-prompt (string) "Prompt in the minibuffer for password and send without echoing. Looks for a match to `comint-password-prompt-regexp' in order to detect the need to (prompt and) send a password. Ignores any carriage returns (\\r) in STRING. This function could be in the list `comint-output-filter-functions'." (when (let ((case-fold-search t)) (string-match comint-password-prompt-regexp (string-replace "\r" "" string))) ;; Use `run-at-time' in order not to pause execution of the ;; process filter with a minibuffer (run-at-time 0.1 nil (lambda (current-buf) (with-current-buffer current-buf (let ((comint--prompt-recursion-depth (1+ comint--prompt-recursion-depth))) (if (> comint--prompt-recursion-depth 10) (message "Password prompt recursion too deep") (when (get-buffer-process (current-buffer)) (comint-send-invisible (string-trim string "[ \n\r\t\v\f\b\a]+" "\n+"))))))) (current-buffer))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I have a record type like
 data PosInt = PosInt { getInt :: Int } 
 and I want to maintain some invariance about it. Here, that the wrapped Int is always positive (I know in this example I could also use a newtype but bear with me). So (I guess?) the standard approach would be to not expose the type constructor, so only the current module can construct instances of type PosInt. However, I still want to give read access to the wrapped Int, so I want to expose getInt. I might end up with something like:
 module Lib ( PosInt(getInt), setInt) where data PosInt = PosInt { getInt :: Int } setInt :: Int -> Maybe PosInt setInt x | x > 0 = Just (PosInt x) | otherwise = Nothing 
 Now if I try to construct a PosInt outside this module, the type checker complains:
 import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test1 :: PosInt test1 = PosInt (-3) -- type error 
 So far so good. But given a PosInt I can actually violate my invariance using the getInt field:
 import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test2 :: PosInt -> PosInt test2 x = x { getInt = -3 } -- no type error 
 That caught me a bit off guard. It's not a problem if I define getInt "manually":
 data PosInt = PosInt Int getInt :: PosInt -> Int getInt (PosInt x) = x 
 Maybe I misunderstood the role of record fields. This convention of calling them getSomething gave me the impression that they only give read access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tldr: Don't upgrade your tree-sitter library, otherwise Emacs will crash when loading it. If you've already upgraded tree-sitter, either a) roll back to v0.22.2, or b) rebuild Emacs. If you use a package manager, uninstalling and reinstalling Emacs should rebuild Emacs.
 The latest version of tree-sitter library is binary-incompatible with the previous version, but the ABI version remains unchanged. That means package managers will simply replace the old libtree-sitter.so file with the new one. Then when Emacs runs, this binary-incompatible libtree-sitter.so is loaded and crashes Emacs.
 What should've happened is for tree-sitter to bump the ABI version; then package managers would install the new libtree-sitter.so file alongside the old libtree-sitter.so, rather than replacing it. And Emacs will still load the old libtree-sitter.so. 
 Rebuilding Emacs will resolve this issue since Emacs and tree-sitter remain compatible on the source level. Rebuild the Emacs binary and it'll be compatible with the new tree-sitter binary.

 I checked the widget library in emacs and I would like to know what is the concern about use this library ?
 Nobody who write a new mode/package use the widgets.
 I think to use this library for the setting it is reasonable but every package creator prefer the "code" based setting.
 I know I can use the customize-variable to set a variable but to create a custom page with widget to setup a module/mode/function should be a good point for the newbies.
 Is there a plan to use GTK based widget in the future ? :)

 when i try to move next on the buffer with arrow keys a mode that informs and corrects me with notifications like you can use C-n for that. 
 If there is any mode like this it will be very beneficial for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently trying to rely more on emacs for file browsing and stumbled upon the openwith package. It allows the user to specify which programs to use for opening which file types, and the choice is respected by find-file and dired-find-file. This is super useful as there are some file types which I never want to open in emacs. 
 The following config is more or less taken from github and tells emacs to open "doc", "xls", ... with "libreoffice":
 (use-package openwith :config (setq openwith-associations (list (list (openwith-make-extension-regexp '("doc" "xls" "ppt" "odt" "ods" "odg" "odp")) "libreoffice" '(file)) )) :init (openwith-mode 1)) 
 Unfortunately, it requires me to explicitly specify which program to use for which file and does not seem to work when I replace "libreoffice" with "xdg-open". Does anybody know why or whether there are any alternative packages that do something similar but work with xdg-open?

 How can I do this in an efficient way via org-ql (I can use rgrep to achieve something similar)? 
 Using org-ql-search interactively allows me to choose "all" files/directories, which is too broad. There doesn't seem to be universal argument support, so I can't pass the directory via "C-u".
 I've also tried the org-roam-ql package, but for whatever reason, this doesn't seem able to return the correct results -- maybe all the nodes have to be proper Org-roam nodes, with a corresponding org-id?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I setup treesitter months ago and everything was working fine. However, earlier today I opened a file using the `js-ts-mode` and my entire emacs session was killed. I have been able to track this down to whenever I use a treesitter based major mode, not just `js-ts-mode`. I don't know if this was caused by me updating my packages or something else (I am using Void Linux btw). Any idea how to resolve this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: I'm trying to change the color of the cursor according to the enabled theme, but the color of the cursor don't change when I start Emacs.
 Just to give a little of context I'm a web dev an currently working with a lot of css code. Emacs has a css-mode that change the background of the face of color codes meaning a { background-color: #fff } will have the #fff with a white background (just like the rainbow-mode package does). 
 The thins is that my cursor often get lost in certain color and I don't like that so I decided to write a little of elisp to fix this (realice that a white or black cursor does the job). Also forgot to mention that I switch a lot between dark and light themes so I figure that I need to change the cursor color according to that. Doing my research came across to this https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/modus-themes/A-theme_002dagnostic-hook-for-theme-loading.html and this helped me to do the part of calling the function to change the color when I change of theme. 
 Everything work fine until I restart Emacs or open Emacs for the first time (like when I turn on my computer on my job) because the color of the cursor don't change when Emacs start so I'm a little lost here and I'm not sure if I missing something. 
 Also I'm checking the *messages* buffers and appears that the function load correctly so.... 
 Here is the code I'm using:
 (defvar after-enable-theme-hook nil "Hook to run after enabling a theme.") (defun run-after-enable-theme-hook (&rest _args) "Run `after-enable-theme-hook'." (message "executin hook after-enable-theme-hook") (run-hooks 'after-enable-theme-hook) (let* ((color-mode (frame-parameter nil 'background-mode)) (cursor-color (if (eq color-mode 'dark) "red" nil))) (set-face-attribute 'cursor nil :background cursor-color))) (advice-add 'enable-theme :after #'run-after-enable-theme-hook) 
 (load-theme 'gruvbox-dark-hard)

 lemmy RSS feeds (such as "https://lemmy.ml/feeds/c/emacs.xml") often (but not always) have mis-guided "Link:" elements which target an external link, an image file or other material instead of the lemmy post itself. Consequently, hitting 'b' elfeed-search-browse-url may send one on a surprising if not always useful journey.
 eg
 Title: Keymacs, a program to generate Emacs keybindings | Plain DrOps Author: https://feddit.de/u/DrOps Date: Tue, 23 Apr 2024 23:35:25 AEST Feed: Lemmy - emacs Tags: emacs, lemmy Link: https://plaindrops.de/blog/2024/keymacs/ submitted by DrOps to emacs 8 points | 2 comments https://plaindrops.de/blog/2024/keymacs/ 
 In this case, the link to lemmy itself is in the "2 comments" => https://lemmy.ml/post/14798221
 Has anyone a fix for this? It's more likely needed at lemmy itself but given the infinite adaptability of emacs perhaps there's a way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Scala people, I'm currently writing tests for some http4s routes for a "pet" project, I'm using the default dependencies that came in from the http4s library scala 3 starter so I'm using MUnit + Munit-cats-effect. I needed to "mock" PetAlgebra as petRoutes is using it.
 My questions are:
  
I'm using Mockito-core as ScalaMock doesn't work with Munit and that is not a "me problem". Does the regular mockito get used along with the typelevel stack or I've just hacked up something.
 Why would I use MUnit over ScalaTest, from what I gather it's a matter of preferrence, some say code using cats-effect is easier to test via MUnit, but ScalaTest integrations with that too
 Would this method pass a PR? It does the job, but it feels like I pigeonholed java style into Scala and it looks clunky, how/do I have to change it to be idiomatic FP
  
​
 test("GET /pet/:id should return 200 and pet JSON when found") { val expectedPet = Pet(/*not important*/) val mockPetAlgebra = mock(classOf[PetAlgebra[IO]]) when(mockPetAlgebra.read(1)).thenReturn( IO.pure(Right(expectedPet)) ) val expectedJson = petDeepEncoder(expectedPet) val petRoutes = PetclinicRoutes.petRoutes[IO](mockPetAlgebra) val request = Request[IO](Method.GET, uri"/pet/1") for responseOpt <- petRoutes.run(request).value response <- IO.fromOption(responseOpt)( new NoSuchElementException("Expected a response") ) respJson <- response.as[Json] yield assertEquals(respJson, petDeepEncoder(expectedPet)) assertEquals(response.status, Status.Ok) } 
 Thanks in advance

 Could someone point out where the problems are in the code? Also, why does the `while` block never seem to stop? 
 (I noticed that emacs returns the last return value (as opposed to python where the first `return value` defines the value a function returns. I wonder if this is related, but haven't gotten across.)
 Thank you very much.

That being said, I can't seem to bring myself anymore to use a language that uses if-statements rather than if-expressions. However I'm not so far into the deep end of Scala that I feel the need to F[_] everything up.
 So while I hope the Scala market picks back up in the future, what alternative languages with jobs are there in the meantime, that I might feel comfortable with?

However, I'm encountering an issue: the info message doesn't appear correctly when I run my code on clusters with primary and secondary nodes. Strangely, it works fine during unit testing, but a lot of info output without SparkContext.parallelize related function on the clusters.
 I've experimented with using `foreachPartition` or `foreach`, but these changes impact other subsequent logic. Can anyone provide some keywords or guidance for reference? Debugging code involving `SparkContext.parallelize` efficiently can be challenging. Thank you!
 Below is example by scala 2
 val RDDResult: RDD[Row] = SparkContext.parallelize(ID,10).mapPartitions(
 ID =>{logger.info("show the message 1)

 logger.info("show the message 2)

 One thing I can't seem to figure out is how to use custom sorting in org-ql-search. According to the documentation (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql) you can use a "a user-defined comparator function that accepts two items as arguments and returns nil or non-nil".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm interested in how the workflow for many of you is. I'm realizing that i'm doing more and more things inside emacs and struggle to find a balance of what i want keybinds for. Some stuff is super obvious, like `project-find-file` or Window navigation. But with Org-Mode, Roam/Denote, Magit, Dired and Terminal things, i'm not sure how many functions i want to bind to keybinds.
 Thing is, keybinds are only quicker, if you remember them. If you need to search through which-key, just `M-x` and searching is faster. So, do you tend to create keybinds for most things in the packages you use? Or just for the one or two things you use multiple times a day and search for the rest?
 Additionally, maybe someone can give me a hint if this is possible: Can i come up with a sort of "custom Command Palette"? So, like `M-x` but it should only contain commands is specifiy? I find that with things like consult or other packages, searching `M-x` can be hard, when a package provides tens of interactive commands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can someone please help me tame expand-region?
 You know, the package that lets you mark, expand and contract the expansion?
 This is what I want, I want it to start expanding in this order:
  
First select the word
 Then select until the end of line
 Then if the cursor initially was not at the beginning of the line, I want it to mark the whole line,
 then paragraph, etc. etc.
  
The way how it's usually achieved is by setting "mode expansions", i.e.,:
  (defun er/add-mode-expansions () (setq-local er/try-expand-list '(er/mark-word er/mark-eol er/mark-bol er/mark-paragraph .... ))) (er/enable-mode-expansions 'text-mode 'er/add-mode-expansions) 
 What I see is happening is that it often skips the first step, immediately proceeding to the selection until the end of line.
 Ideally (I think), I'd like it to mark the word, then next adjacent word right after, then to the end of line, and so forth. But first, I need to figure out the simple one. 
 Why is it skipping the first step?
  
Additional notes:
 er/mark-word and er/mark-paragraph are defined in expand-region code. er/mark-eol and er/mark-bol are my custom functions, and they seem to be working just fine, at least when they are called directly, and not via er/expand-region. Interestingly, er/mark-word is also doing what you expect, when called independently. But when it's called as a mode-expansion, expand-region often skips it (unless the cursor initially is at the exact beginning of the word).

I'd like to start using org-mode to create meeting agendas for various status and tagup meetings I attend with my boss and other team-mates working on projects. To date, my LaTEX/PDF exports tend to look more like term papers with bullet lists instead of paragraphs of text, so I end up cutting/pasting into MS Word to get simple lists of topics and action items to status. 
 Does anyone have a recommended template or workflow for preparing itemized lists of topics to discuss at meetings? I've found several templates for capturing meeting minutes, but my needs are slightly different than that. I'm looking for a titled document with a date and simple two-column bulleted lists - perhaps including a table, graphic, etc.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am a new emacs user so please bear with me. I was setting up org-roam so I can have all my files from different categories linked if there is a relationship. For example, if I have a journal entry that talked about a philosophical topic in application to my life, I want it to link to one of my studies of that topic that is part of the philosophy category. Essentially, I want to map my brain. 
 In order to keep my files organized, I was planning on keeping my files for each topic in a completely separate directories from the Org-roam directory. I would have an org file in the Org-roam directory that links to that particular file and if there is a relationship, I would just link the org files in the Org-roam directory. In other words, the org files in the Org-roam directory simply contains links to the actual files in my file system and serves as the linker. 
 To organize my files in my file system, I plan on using the denote package for its file naming scheme.
 How does this setup sound? Are there any better setup designs that you can recommend? I was thinking about just using denote, but I like the org-roam-ui and I would like to keep everything in separate dirs. However, if this setup is not feasible then I might do that instead.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've mentioned my new effect system, Bluefin, a few times on Haskell Reddit. It's now ready for me to announce it more formally.
 Bluefin's API differs from all prior effect systems in that it implements a "well typed Handle/Services pattern". That is, all effects are accessed through value-level handles, which makes it trivial to mix a wide variety of effects, including:
  
Bluefin.EarlyReturn, for early return
 Bluefin.Exception, for exceptions
 Bluefin.IO, for I/O
 Bluefin.State, for mutable state
 Bluefin.Stream, for streams
  
If you're interested then read the Introduction to Bluefin. I'd love to know what you all think.

 That book recommends Emacs for Clojure, and I decided to give it a spin. It also provides some config files for Emacs, here: https://nostarch.com/clojure
 It's looking good so far - I vastly prefer keybindings and typing commands than clicking on GUIs (and I sort of already do that with my current "IDE" of choice, VSCode), but there are a few features that I'm missing
 Auto-complete, for example: how do I get that?
 Also symbol renaming is so very useful - by symbol renaming I mean how in VSCode you can press F2 on a function or variable name, type in a new name, then the variable/function will be renamed everywhere within the project, in a context-sensitive way - so, for example, if I have a poorly name function named, idk, getVars, I can F2 that function, type in getUserPreferences and everywhere that function is used in any other file within the project will be renamed
 Is that something that Emacs can do in a reasonable way? (e.g. without me having to write a lengthy program)
 EDIT: What an awesome community! Thanks for answers, folks!

 I have been a devoted user of org-roam. It just works. There has been some discussion that development has stalled. Nonetheless, it works and it works well.
 What I want to do in this post is to document a bit better how templates work.
 First of all, a bit of context. Templates in org roam piggyback on org templates. Let us use the example from the org-roam manual:
  (("d" "default" plain "%?" :target (file+head "%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${slug}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n") :unnarrowed t))

But know that I appreciate you allowing me to rage against the machine for a few minutes. At very least it'll stop me chucking my laptop out the nearest open window.
 So, as well as reading docs, trying code, and my usual flailing about as I learn Org and lisp, I admit that I am not averse to also seeing what ChatGPT has to say on a topic. Today it was on the use of properties in calculations, in particular table formulae, and using org-entry-get-multivalued-property and the like.

Copy all files in your specific original_dir to a new_dir to preserve your Obsidian .md files in case of an error.
 Add PROPERTIES, ID, END, title, and filetags at the very start of the file. 
 If you plan on using #+filetags, you'll need to run this separately for each tag(s) you want to add.
 
 Rename an .md file "Text1 Text2 Text3.md" to "text1_text2_text3-lastModifiedTimestamp.org." 
 Note that the title added to the file is separated from the renaming process after removing the .md extension, so it stays as e.g., "Text1 Text2 Text3."

 I was checking out the new gears library (https://lampepfl.github.io/gears/) . I noticed that scala.js is not supported. I understand that Scala native is using the newly developed delimited continuations support, and the JVM version, the new virtual threads. 
 As JS is single threaded, I wonder if that makes it impossible to implement gears on it, or it requires some new feature that is not yet there, or there are just not enough resources to do it right now... so, do you know why ScalaJS is not supported by gears?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting yesterday, when I try to build my personal site via GitHub actions, I get a `Failed to download ‘elpa’ archive.` message, with the net result that attempting to install the `webfeeder` package fails and, ultimately, the site build fails. I'm finding this one a bit of a head scratcher!
  
I have made no changes to the build script that might have impacted this (aside from various since-reverted attempts to fix it)
 The build environment doesn't appear to have changed between the last successful build and the first failure (same emacs version, same ubuntu version, etc)
 It works fine locally
 I get the same warning when attempting to use elpa-mirror.
  
I would greatly appreciate any thoughts/suggestions! If nothing works I can just clone and manually install the necessary package but I would much prefer to solve this issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although I use Emacs for quite some time, I don't usually go very deep into how everything works and connects together (lazy Doom Emacs user here).
 And I miss this feature: when I checkout a local branch in Magit by pressing b l, I am presented with a list of branches to choose from. And this list is sorted alphabetically (it seems). I wish it was sorted in the LRU manner instead.
 How would I approach this? Must this be done by Magit? Or is it the feature of either vertico or embark which I use? But I still would need to supply them a branch modification time somehow...
 Any pointers on where to go from here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In http://gem.librehacker.com/gemlog/starlog/20240418-0.gmi Christopher Howard talks about segregating Roam nodes into different areas, perhaps by project. He provides some code to select different Roam setups. I'm responding here as Christopher doesn't provide a way to reply or comment.
 I have segregated my Roam data into two areas, work and personal. My Roam settings on my work laptop are for the work Roam data:
 (custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. . . . '(org-roam-directory "/home/davemarq/org/roam/" nil nil "Customized with use-package org-roam") 
 My personal Roam data is in a directory pers I synch between work and home via Github. I use this personal Roam database at work too. To set my roam directory for this area, I use directory local settings in pers/.dir-locals.el:
 ((nil . ((org-roam-db-location . "~/pers/org-roam/org-roam.db") (org-roam-directory . "~/pers/org-roam")))) 
 I'm not a user of project or projectile, but I suspect one could also set these variables per project using mechanisms provided by project or projectile.

 Almost all the keys seems to be occupied. So, what are the options left?

 https://cdn.zappy.app/87bee52262a7d88cc60b5a596339cca1.gif
 It does not happen with other ligatures, nor with other fonts I've tried. So it could be a problem with this font, although the ligature displays correctly in VS Code. The combination of Emacs, this font, and this ligature causes the problem.
 Although as mentioned I'm using ligature.el, I reproduced the above gif more simply using emacs -q and this elisp:
 (set-char-table-range composition-function-table t '(["||" 0 font-shape-gstring])) (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "PragmataPro Mono Liga") 
 Increasing `line-spacing` does not help. 
 Any ideas as to a workaround? Visually it's a little annoying. Thanks!

 With a compiled init.el file, I'm finding that use-package-always-defer isn't working the way it ought to. At the beginning of my init, I have this:
 (setq use-package-always-defer (not (daemonp)) use-package-always-demand (daemonp))) 
 However, I find that packages still get eagerly loaded. The only way I have found to change this is to replace with the following:
 (eval-when-compile (setq use-package-always-defer t)) 
 Can anyone explain what's going on here?

In any case I want to make sure that I have the basic idea down correctly.
I searched for other posts on this but I didn't feel like I found a really conclusive answer. People seem to have different ideas, some expressed more strongly than others.
As far as I currently understand it, a Literature Note is a summary of any concept or idea that comes from a source other than yourself. Books will be a regular source, but audio, video, personal conversations, etc. technically could as well. The Literature Note should have some kind of way to identi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been having a weird issue w/ org-mode for a while now. I have a giant org file (~3 megs) with tons of nested headlines, and every so often when I'm zooming around one of them won't expand. Other nearby headlines will still expand, but this one won't.
 I can get around the issue by deleting the collapsed headline and whatever subtree is underneath it, then yanking it back, right where it was. Once I do that, I can expand it just fine, and I won't have the problem again for days. I can't figure out any commonalities as to why this happens. I think it's happened across multiple versions of emacs (running 29.2 now) and org (9.6.25) but because I am a dumbass, I was not exhaustive in tracking the first appearance.
 I doubt anybody will be able to diagnose the issue from what I've written here, so diagnosis isn't what I'm after. What I'm after is this: could someone tell me how to get whatever contextual info would be most relevant to debug it properly, next time it happens? Then I can come back and have a chance of figuring it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have read in the manual that SCHEDULED is supposed to be the start time when one will start working on a meeting. However, it's pretty convenient to use a time range (using the commands that org-mode supports to manipulate the SCHEDULED timestamp is very convenient). Also, query languages like org-mode's internal language and org-ql support querying the SCHEDULED time specifically. 
 Using ranges with SCHEDULED is widespread.
 Would it make sense to change SCHEDULED to mean the time when one will work on a task? (either start working on it, if it's not a range, or spend working on it, if it's a range).

 This layout removes the “Emacs pinkie” and allows you to work comfortably, since the Modifiers are located as in the original source.
 Low distance travel, top row (gray buttons on image) are kept only for gaming
 Excellent for most types of programming languages and numeric input

 I work in big data space (data engineering), I mainly used Java, Scala and Python.
 I have been learning functional programming in greater depth and I found this Python library which seems pretty cool.
 https://github.com/dry-python/returns
 I've used it at work for implementing an Either based error handling.
 It seems a great library.
 Any of you have used it?
 Any thoughts?
 For sure, I prefer doing FP in Scala but given the job market isn't too kind too Scala and FP languages in general. What are your thoughts to bring FP (at least parts of it) to the Python world?
 Some people in the TypeScript world seem to take that direction:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, first of all I would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who has contributed to this forum. I've been here for a while now reading all sorts of posts, but only now did I need to create an account for the sake of joining the discussion.
I'll just briefly introduce myself, my name is Petr and I'm 20 years old, I love fitness, biohacking and anything that improves a person's mental/physical performance and especially health in general. I guess that's about me.
Now for the interesting stuff. This is probably going to be a very direct question, but how do I include in a permanent note the studies that the text or some statement in it discusses? I was thinking of putting a letter or number at the end of a sentence the normal way, but then I wonder if that would interfere with the note itself. Or should I leave the references to the literature note?
Example from today:
How do you guys approach this?
My goal is to create content on social media as well as developing my knowledge.
I apologize for the probably vague question, I still have a lot to learn.
Thank you!
Petr]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Functional programming has come up with very interesting ways of managing 'effects'. But curiously I haven't found an explicit definition of what is meant by this word. Most of the time it seems interchangeable with 'monad'. I also have the impression is that the word 'effect' is used when talking about managing a program's control flow.
 Is it the case that effects are about control flow? Are all effects representable with monads, and do all monads potentially model effects?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to change how isearch works. What I want is to be able to type in my search string, hit "RET", and then be able use abbreviated characters for different behavior, such as "n" for isearch-repeat-foreward, "p" for isearch-repeat-backwards, "o" for isearch-occur, etc. I want to also be able to switch back to normal isearch with something like "i" so I can modify my search string. What I tried was to create a custom minor mode that would change the keybindings to what I want. From my understanding, since this mode is more recently added to minor-mode-alist and minor-mode-map-alist, the bindings in my-isearch-mode-map should take higher precedence than isearch-mode-map. However, when I define it and activate it, isearch bindings still function like the default.
 Here is the link to my code. Be warned, it is not pretty as this is my first time writing a minor mode.
 What am I missing? Is there a better way to do this? I want to avoid hacky solutions to the best of my ability and I don't want to have to go down to route of trying (and probably failing) to remake isearch just to get this one thing to work.
 I am open to suggestions on other packages as well. Currently I am using swiper primarily for search, however I want to start using isearch because of its integration with other emacs functionality like occur-mode. It is also built into emacs which is also a plus.
 Any help is appreciated, thank you in advance.

 Eglot-rename does not seem to work with this. I don't know if there is a way in AucTeX, other than maybe writing a customized function. I am trying to avoid that since it is an in-built function in Vim or TexStudio.
 Any help would be useful. Thanks a lot.

I'm trying to create a Haskell program that can parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions in infix form containing operators +, -, *, /, %, and **, as well as numeric constants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In OS X, I would like to run two instances of emacs. MacOS uses the name of application to display all info about it (e.g. when switching apps, the first string in the menu bar). I would like one instance to have a different name. Furthermore, hammerspoon uses the app name in several of its internal functions to keep track of the app windows.
 I have tried to rename the application in the Info.plist file.
 I have been successful changing the CFBundleIdentifier. But when I change the CFBundleName, this change does not take effect. Does anybody know how I can change the name of the running Emacs (even if it involves recompilation of the binary)? 
 Thank you,

In place of what should have been a buffer for org-agenda-list is a seemingly random buffer.
 Apparently desktop-buffer-mode-handlers can add support for Org Agenda buffers but I don't see an e.g. org-agenda-restore-buffer so I guess on would need to use a custom function? I don't know much programming so hoping someone has found a solution for this.
 I also looked into activities.el but it looks like each "activity" is a frame/tab, but for my workflow with a tiling window manager I find it more suitable to liberally create and destroy frames from my window manager's workspaces and for now at least am just looking for a way to restore all buffers/frames/window configuration without the need to create and switch projects. Actually activities.el might be suitable if an activity includes a set a frames. I prefer dealing with frames than Emac's window management because I often work with at least a browser alongside in a window manager workspace and it's just less cognitive overhead to treat each buffer as a frame when the rest of your applications are also managed by the window manager.

 (defmacro foo (x) `(defun bar (y) `(,,x ,y)))

 (defmacro foo (x) (let ((form `(backquote (,x ,',y)))) `(defun bar (y) ,form)))

I created my first Cabal package, https://github.com/aaditmshah/hledger-check-postings, and pushed it to GitHub. Since I'm a complete noob, I'm looking for guidance on improving the package and publishing it to Hackage. I would appreciate it if you would look at my code and tooling, and suggest improvements by creating new GitHub issues or starting new GitHub discussions. For example, I want to add unit tests, Haddock documentation, and continuous integration via GitHub actions. I also want to publish my executable on Hackage so that it's easier to discover and install. Furthermore, I would love to automate process of bumping the version number, updating the changelog, and publishing a new version to Hackage via continuous deployment. Finally, I would love to hear all the tips and counsel that you Haskell veterans have to offer, both here and on GitHub issues or GitHub discussions.

 Pretty new to the language (and functional programming more generally) so not sure on what I’m missing here but I can’t figure out the proper way of exception handling in Scala.
 So as I understand it an Option or an Either should be used most of the time to produce a None or an alternate value in the Left of the Either. Then exceptions should be thrown only in rare circumstances as they are a side effect?
 If that’s correct then:
  
How do you evaluate that the circumstance is right for an exception to be thrown?
 
What are the alternative values you provide instead of an exception that can keep the program running?

What could it be not making it work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As my first Halogen application has just surpassed 3K lines of Purescript code, and contains several components that communicate with and through each other, -I am starting to wish that I had some sort of visual 'map' to navigate the relationship between my components.
 This is where I got the idea that what if we could simply invoke a function on the 'root' component and then the function would output something like 'plantUML' which then can be compiled to a diagram. In theory all the required information to generate the diagram is contained in the type information for all the Halogen components.
 Being relatively new to Purescript, I don't have any clear idea how this could be achieved. But roughly I am thinking that since Purescript is quite weak on the metaprogramming side of things, one would probably have to exploit some FFI and JS to extract the information required to generate the diagram.
 For now I will probably just manually create my visual 'map' with plantUML since I am busy on my own project, however I just wanted to throw the idea out there. Perhaps I will work on it in the future, or perhaps someone else will like the idea and work on it.
 In any case it would be cool to hear from more experienced Purescript programmers whether or not this is possible and how it could be accomplished. I personally think it would be quite awesome to be able to generate visual overviews like that.

Its bloody good package, but I don't need 99% of what comes with it ( which now I realize I really miss :'( ). I am making my config from scratch and I really need some help with making org-mode work the way i want. 
  
This is my primary issue (Image) . Notice how the text in lists wraps right under the its number. I want it to align with the text block (marked in red).
 In Doom Emacs whenever my cursor was on a list item that entire item would be highlighted. How do I replicate this?
 Where can I find all the commands I can use to customize org-mode? I did not find this in the manual, or am I not looking hard enough?
  
I am using emacs 29 (the crafted emacs config) on Mac OS.
 PS - Indent mode and other relevant options are enabled

I'm fairly new to emacs I'm using emacs 29.1, I do web development with typescript and react,so I configure emacs for that purpose, first I've only use the treesiter modes for typescript and tsx (typescript-ts-mode and tsx-ts-mode) until a friend introduce to lsp and tell me to use eglot since is builtin into emacs.
 So I did my research and find about autocompletion with company-mode and that is another mode called lsp-mode, so I decided to try both eglot and lsp-mode. first I use eglot and everything work well until I came across this tutorial -> https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/reactjs-tutorial/ then I decided to give a try to lsp-mode
 Later on working normaly with lsp y decided to switch back to do a comparision with eglot and realize that in lsp you can autocomplete snippets but then switching to eglot that same thing don't happen. but accordingly to the eglot page you can autocomplete snippets using yasnippet (which I'm already using with lsp-mode) but for some reason this is not working and searching across internet I didn't find any solution. So maybe I'm missing something?
 If I didn't explain my self maybe these gif help.

 note: I tried eglot and company with another languages (c-ts-mode, c++-ts-mode) and there works perfectly, only with typescript and javascript buffers don't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the C environment setup from the Wikemacs tutorial, which includes helm-gtags and gg tags. I first thought this was conflicting with c-eldoc, but turning those off did nothing to give me c-eldoc functionality. The closest I can get to actual functionality is to load an empty file with no extension (that doesn't trigger a language mode), and then run c-turn-on-eldoc-mode. From here I get a null pstring error every time I hover over a symbol. At least that is something. 
 Weather the gtags packages are on or off, c-eldoc does absolutely nothing otherwise, besides turning on the "Eldoc" indicator. 
 I'm wondering if there is backend setup that I'm missing. 
 I tried downloading from github and compiling, I get warnings about missing cache functions, and emacs doesn't seem to load it despite the folder being in 'load-path'; I'm not experienced with installing packages this way; that's another issue. 
 Mine is from Melpa.
 I'd like to see function signatures from the standard libraries.
 I have an F1 shortcut set for man pages, but sometimes that's overkill, and sometimes the specifics of the function are embedded in a much larger man page of related functions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been trying to setup emacs for the first time and it's been pretty easy and straightforward apart from a couple issues. I'm setting it up on a NixOS Virtual Machine using home-manager: I have two files a default.nix where I say which packages to install and a config.el where I write the configs. Here are the relevant parts from the files:
 default.nix:
 { pkgs , ... } { programs.emacs = { enable = true; package = pkgs.emacs; extraConfig = builtins.readFile ./config.el; extraPackages = epkgs: with epkgs; [ evil evil-collection treesit-auto ]; }; } 
 config.el:
 (setq evil-want-keybinding nil) (require 'evil) (require 'evil-collection) (evil-collection-init) (evil-mode 1) (require 'treesit-auto) (global-treesit-auto-mode) 
 The issues are:
 When I run home-manager switch I get two issues. The first one is assignment to free variable 'evil-want-keybinding' followed by a reminder to set evil-want-keybinding to nil before loading evil and evil collection (even if I am doing it).
 The second one is that it gives the error cannot open load file: no such file or directory, treesit.
 I've tested and the issues are disconnected from one another. I've been googling around for a day now and I wasn't able to find a fix to either. If any of you may know how to fix I'd be grateful.
 EDIT: Regarding the treesitter problem, I'm just a moron. The default pkgs.emacs is version 28. Changing it to pkgs.emacs29 it works. It does compile and works, but it does still give me issues about evil-want-keybinding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I already tried asking this over on the citeproc-el github, but while I wait for an answer there I figured I would try my luck here.
 Basically, I'm having trouble rendering certain superscripted citations properly when exporting to ODT. Instead of showing a proper superscripted citation, the generated ODT document shows the underlying org shorthand (e.g., ^{1}). Using a (relatively) minimal example:
  
#+TITLE: Manuscript Title 
 #+OPTIONS: author:nil toc:nil num:nil 
 #+CITE_EXPORT: csl ~/path/to/CSL/styles/american-medical-association.csl 
 * Testing 
 This is a test sentence with a citation.[cite:@somecitekey] 
 This is standard superscript.^{1} 
 #+PRINT_BIBLIOGRAPHY:
  
The first sentence will render as (^{1}), and the second sentence will render with appropriate superscript (1). The bibliography will render appropriately according to the CSL style, as expected.
 Interestingly, when I export to other formats such as HTML, the superscripted citations render appropriately—it's only ODT that has issues. Also, unsurprisingly, this isn't an issue for CSL formats that do not require superscript for in-text citations.
 For reference, I'm using citeproc-el and the advanced org-mode-ox-odt fork to export org files to ODT, although I don't know how much of a difference this makes.
 Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!

The basic issue concerns where timestamps are "best" placed. In the original question, the focus was on whether an Entry's PROPERTY drawer was an acceptable location, but I've been trying to understand it more generally. When I wrote my answer earlier today, I talked about how Org handled timestamps depending on which of FOUR locations was chosen. In the subsequent hours, I've discovered a FIFTH. It wouldn't surprise me if there are even more. So, FWIW:

 I do a lot of data exploration in org, similar to what one would do in a Jupyter notebook, and it’s a bit of a pain to come up with a unique filename for each one. I’d much prefer just to be able to kill/yank the header and reuse it for each code chunk.
 EDIT: Just realized I can create a yasnippet that inserts the timestamp right into the header. That should solve my problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't make the font in a emacs window look like the one in the font picker dialog from the menu bar.
 In the font picker I can specify 9, 9.5 and 10 and they all look different, I want to use 9.5 but emacs windows display/round the font to 10. When using a size of 9.5 the font picker saves the font as the following:
 '(default ((t (:family "Comic Code" :foundry "TAB " :slant normal :weight regular :height 98 :width normal))))
 I tried messing with multiple values of :height but that didn't work. I'm guessing the font picker dialog is some gtk widget and uses a different font rendering? In a terminal, the font is displayed correctly with 9.5, looks the same as in the file picker with 9.5.
 What should I look for to solve this issue?

 This works in the GUI. However, when I'm running -nw in the MacOS Terminal, either the system or terminal app is hijacking the Command shortcuts. So, for example, Command-n creates a new terminal window and Command-p opens the print dialog. How do I disable all of the Command shortcuts of the terminal?

 One new feature is the single hyrolo.py script which you can install for shell command-line record-level access to your Org, Markdown and Emacs Outline files. You give the search string and files to search on the command-line and it highlights the match in the lowest-level records that match. You can then pipe that into any other program. Not quite as powerful as the Emacs version of HyRolo but useful in other contexts. On an old machine, a single word search over 1300 files with four matches takes 0.75 seconds.
 Enjoy.

Choreographing a dance with the GHC specializer (Part 1) by Finley McIlwaine
Overloaded functions are common in Haskell, but they come with a cost. Thankfully, the GHC specialiser is extremely good at removing that cost. We can therefore write high-level, polymorphic programs and be confident that GHC will compile them into very efficient, monomorphised code. In this episode, we’ll demystify the seemingly magical things that GHC is doing to achieve this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs is the best singular computer-interaction framework I’ve encountered so far, but we can all agree it has its flaws. Single-threaded performance characteristics, limited to text (rather than some more flexible core abstraction, perhaps one which would better allow making full use of the screen as a 2D canvas), Elisp (which while decent isn’t on par with the self-contained Lisp languages like CL), and other more minor problems.
 Are there any promising projects going on to make a replacement or successor for Emacs? The only ones I’m aware of are Lem and Project Mage; the former only solves 2 of the above major issues, and the latter is literally a one-person effort right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been using Haskell for a while now, I've gotten the hang of monads, applicatives, lazy evaluation, dabbled in mtl, lenses, and free monads, and I've absolutely loved all of it. But there's one single function that perpetually stumps me and I can't seem to understand how it works, and that's fix.
 The definition is
 fix f = let x = f x in x
 Trying to read through some stackoverflow answers explaining this function the closest I could get to understanding it is that the f passed into fix is infinitely composed with itself like so:
  x = f . f $ x -- or x = f (f x) x = f . f . f $ x -- or x = f (f (f x)) x = f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f $ x -- etc. 
 Given this explanation my question is, if a function is infinitely composed with itself, even if we were to have lazy evaluation here, how could it ever possibly terminate? The documentation says something about how fix produces the least fixed point of a function, looking that up I see something about domain theory and don't get any closer to understanding it. This is the one thing I feel like I simply can't get about this language. Can anyone help me out here?

However seems to be neovim with many of its distros is nowadays the best experience for out of the box similarity with many of vscode's features, however knowing emacs is emacs I know everything's possible but is it worth the effort? Also with vanilla emacs I've seen some performance drawbacks whit heavy configurations and things were sometimes not as smooth even as vscode and I've heard neovim is very fast and light. Do you think emacs is a good idea for my goals? Maybe doom emacs already has what I want? So I don't have to spend weeks configuring emacs.....

 when I type, it will randomly hang a bit and emit the text I type, but in the wrong sequence of keystrokes. I used to think that it might be completion-at-point taking too much time, but there's honestly nothing there, and there are various of times they are very fast.
  
I used to assume that it was my keyboard as I basically only use emacs when I'm using my computer, but I just tested that other program don't seem to have this problem
 So I suspect it is something with emacs.
 ​
 I tested the typing problem in firefox(I rolled "123123123" on my keyboard) and emacs. In firefox there's occasional delay but very brief and no sequence error, and in emacs this happened
 "123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123121323232311123123123123123123123123"
 notice the "121323232311" part at the back, that's when emacs hangs and emit the whole of them out altogether. My hand is quite consistent as you can see all other parts are consistent "123123123".
 ​
 I have no idea why this happens, my machine is generally fast, nothing else (that is only firefox) glitch, and emacs only takes 7% of CPU. I wonder if anyone else have seen this before?
 my emacs version is 29.1 with doomemacs. my config is on z.gehninfel.xyz/20230914114145-doomemacs_configuration.html

 Demo of lasgun.el
 After writing some functionality for my personal configuration, I figured I may as well take a stab at writing my first package out of it.
 lasgun.el takes the Filter -> Select -> Act loop of avy and allows you to repeat the first two steps as needed, then act on the selections in bulk.
 It comes with two actions preloaded: one to place multiple-cursors.el cursors at each mark, and one to run embark-act-all on the positions. Users can define their own actions with the macro define-lasgun-action. Docstrings have usage information. 
 Besides avy, there are no dependencies (optionally mc and embark are needed for the aforementioned actions).

 Hook to save desktop on daemon exit doesn't seem to work, any ideas? Restoring the desktop works if I manually save the desktop:
 (setq desktop-dirname "~/.cache/emacs") (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook #'(lambda () (unless desktop-save-mode (add-hook 'server-done-hook #'(lambda () (desktop-save "~/.cache/emacs"))) (desktop-save-mode 1) (desktop-read)))) 
 The desktop file doesn't get written to disk on C-x C-c or emacsclient -e "(kill-emacs)" so I need to manually evaluate (desktop-save "~/.cache/emacs"). I can also confirm the hook gets updated--it just doesn't seem to apply on daemon exit.

 what is the best package manager, is it use package, straight, elget..? oh so many...
 how should i structure my emacs config? is it only a .emacs or is it separated in init.el package.el straight.el whatever.el? i have no idea
 also i wonder if there is a proper "guide" to all of this, and if so, please tell me
 i also didnt manage to setup lsp because use package was complaining

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Specific question here for tracing in Scala
 In a CRUD webapp, let's say a client receives an http request with a trace header, calls some logic, spins out some new fibers/futures/what-ever and does a bunch of work off the back of this instigating thing that all should be traced.
 If you want flamegraphs etc in the tracing visualisation tool of your choice to show where time gets spent for all subsequent calls (jaeger, datadog, graphana tempo, what-have-you). 
 In Java you'd have the option of instrumenting the JVM, and you'd get this without having to in code pass contexts nor record spans - basically, you instrument the JVM and you're done (unless you want to explicitly gain access to it to do something more specific) and your only (some asterisks here, but, mostly) code interaction is to extract the trace-headers from the incoming http request.
 Am I correct in saying that this is not possible in Scala currently - Scala cannot be instrumented in this manner, and we need to use libraries akin to Natchez and/or otel4s where you manually call Span.trace(or whatever the library uses) each call that you want traced? 
 I guess a TL;DR - is it possible to instrument scala for tracing, or is it necessary to interact with libraries?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at trying out treesitter support again (specifically, c-ts-mode), and one thing that's got me stuck is how to modify the rules that are used to highlight the text. c-ts-mode makes some baffling decisions where it deviates from cc-mode in how certain things get highlighted, and I'd like to change this.
 I haven't been able to see anything about how to modify the highlighting so far. c-ts-mode doesn't offer anything like c-ts-mode-indent-style for modifying indentation, and the general treesitter documentation for font lock stuff doesn't really help. The closest I've figured so far is that maybe you can write a mode hook that adds entries to the treesit-font-lock-settings list, but there's no indication if this would actually work, and if so how.
 I'm worried that the only "solution" right now is to copy-paste the font lock rules in c-ts-mode and manually maintain a separate copy just to change a couple things, which would obviously be unacceptable. And I can't sidestep the issue by, say, modifying font faces to look better, because the issues I want to fix have to do with poorly-chosen generic font faces for some of these rules.
 If modifying syntax highlighting isn't possible right now, then I'll make a feature request and go back to waiting for treesitter support to be usable. I'm just not sure what part of emacs would be responsible for the new feature. I get the impression that the font lock rule system as it is now makes it really difficult for a major mode to let you extend its rules, so I'm leaning towards it being a treesitter feature request (as opposed to a c-ts-mode feature request).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was introduced to Emacs at work and would like to migrate my physical todo list to org-agenda. This process is much easier thanks to the introduction materials by DistroTube, SystemCrafters, and Prod. While the aforementioned youtube videos are useful, I am having difficulty envisioning how best to organize my todos -- especially across multiple projects.
 It seems to me that there are three options (please correct me if I am wrong):
  
Single .org file -- top-level todo headers, :tags: used to organize per project
 Single .org file -- second-level todo headers organized under project-specific top-level headers
 Multiple .org files -- top-level todo headers organized in project-specific .org files
  
What is your approach for tracking/organizing todos across multiple projects?
 I find myself drawn to the idea of having a separate .org file per repository at work, organizing git-issue todos in the top-level header and task "steps" todos at the second-header level. However, I question whether this is the best approach because it would require me to update my configuration (setq org-agend-files ...) should I work on a new repository -- however unlikely.
 ​
 Any recommendations from seasoned `org-agenda` users is welcome!

While I appreciate the tips from then, I'm still stuck and eager to overcome this problem so that I can move on with my learning. Since then, I have read LYAH and I have read a large chunk of Real World Haskell, yet I still can't overcome this obstacle. I have pondered this problem on and off regularly during this six months. I feel like it is holding me back at this point. As before, this is *not homework*. This is for my own edification.
 This code won't compile and I don't know how I could bring it to a state where it could be compiled as I can't figure out the logic behind it. Hopefully this will offer insight into what the program is supposed to do.

 It's sorta niggled at the edges of my brain for a while now - and it must confuse the heck out of newbies as well as those of us (ahem) who stuck stuff into init.el several decades ago and forgot about it. So I thought I'd ask the cool dudes who know ...
 Do packages generally have some kind of protection mechanism to avoid functional conflicts like this? Or at least a warning?
 Or perhaps there's a document somewhere that goes into incompatibilities or maybe just "it makes no sense installing X if you have A, B, C..."

 In an org-capture template, is there any way to have a prompted %-escape that provides both:
  
access to %\N back-references, AND
 calendar support for date-picking (i.e. because it expects a date/time value)
  
Or, more generally: is there a way to get to reuse, further into my capture template, my response to a prompt of the form: %^{Birthday}u?
 Details
 I'd given up trying to beat org-capture templates into the precise shape I want. Instead I was looking more at yasnippets and the like. But I've been having another go with capture†, and although I've just been reminded of one of the reasons I gave up†, I thought I'd check with y'all in case I've missed something.

 # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: # key: # -- 
 For some reason everything past the mode declaration is quasi-randomly indented. I cannot figure out what is doing it and looking at the yasnippet docs this does not seem like the intent.
 My mode line tells me Snippet, ws, yas, company, and wrap are all activated when I invoke yas-new-snippet.
 This is my configuration for yasnippet: 
 (add-to-list 'load-path
 "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet")
 (require 'yasnippet)
 (define-key yas-minor-mode-map (kbd "<tab>") 'yas-expand)
 (setq yas-snippet-dirs '("~/.emacs.d/snippets" )) (yas-global-mode 1) 
 Is there something I am missing? Do I have to configure snippet-mode separately as well?

I've added it to Doom's config.el, which I believe is analogous to Emacs init.el. My config.el file has ;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*- at the top, and describe-variable shows that the value for lexical-binding is indeed 't' in this buffer. When I evaluate the entire buffer, I catch a void-variable (tag-name), which (I believe?) shouldn't be happening when lexical-binding is turned on. However, evaluating only the additional region within the same buffer works fine (temporarily, of course). How can I figure out what's going on?
 Edit #1: selecting every line in the buffer and evaluating as a region works as well. Is my lexical-binding local variable being overlooked for some reason?
 Edit #2: Solved - It was because there was a single white character before ;;; $DOOMDIR.

 Any existing Emacs packages that does this or I'm I really the only one that would want that?

Note that this is for `tab-bar-mode`, not `tab-line-mode`, which means it is a tab per window layout (similar to perspective.el/persp-mode), and not a tab per buffer.

 Please let me know if it works for you and if there's anything you'd like to customize that you can't with this version of the package. No guarantees that I can or will add additional customization options, however.

 I've posted a few times about my tab line config so my love for tabs is public. Recently I've seen several other folks posting as well on the topic and I noticed a trend in the comments with some repeated questions along these lines: 
 <slight exaggeration>
  
But seriously they look nice but do you use them? 
 What's the point / I don't see what it adds beyond switch-buffer?
 I have a lot of files, hundreds really, open - this doesn't look like it will scale.
  
</slight exaggeration>
 So I decided to make another tabs video with my answers and perspective on why I really find them useful and how they work in practice.

 I’ve been a Golang developer most of my career but lately I’ve been feeling kinda stuck knowledge and career wise, so I’m looking for ways to improve my development skills and how to design maintainable clean code. Since I think I’m quite familiar with the common patterns in Go I thought learning a new language might help with broadening my views. I’m currently looking at Zig and Haskell and was going to decide on one of them.
 Im quite curious about your opinion on:
  
Has learning and writing Haskell has affected the way you think about code? not only in Haskell programs but in other languages too.
 
Do you think it has made you better developers? 
 
If so would you able to give some examples? What do you do now that you didn’t before learning Haskell?
 
Has it open some more opportunities for you career wise?
 
 Thank you for taking the time go through this post! Hope you have a great day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm exploring using silos in denote, which I think are potentially very helpful.
 Am I correct in saying that, at present, once I switch to a silo (e.g. with `denote-silo-extras-create-note`), I can't switch back to the default `no-silo` (`denote-directory`) without switching to the `denote-directory` directory in dired? Or is the intention that everything should be in a silo, rather than in the default `denote-directory`?
 Either way, I think things could get complicated working in different silos (assuming the goal is to keep them separate). Perhaps what is needed is some indication prepended to buffer-name of the silo - e.g. if the silo is in ~/Orgs/Silo1 and the #+title is "My plain title", the buffer name would be "Silo1:My plain title". If we were in the default `denote-directory` , buffer-name would just be "My plain title".
 Thanks

Whenever I try to do M-x package install RET lsp-mode RET, it begins downloading as normal, but then it runs into 123 errors all going along the lines of:
 lsp-actionscript.el:27:2: Error: lsp-execute-command is already defined as something else than a generic function
 The other 122 errors are the exact same but for all the lanuages the lsp supports.
 If I go in the lsp-actionscript.el and go to line 27, then it's this command which throws the error:
 (require 'lsp-mode)
 The same goes for all the other errors. I can't seem to find anything about this online. Hope u can help:)
 Btw, I use windows 11 if that makes any difference

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 Hi everyone, I have developed a new library [typed-fsm](https://github.com/sdzx-1/typed-fsm). 
 It allows writing typed finite state machines.
 It has many advantages:
  
Focus on the right message
  
​
  
Top-to-bottom design for easy refactoring
  
​
  
Conducive to building complex state machine systems
  
​
 + Type guarantees will not produce incorrect function calls when written
 + With the help of the type system, we can define many state processing functions and then call each other recursively with confidence.
  
There is a sanity check. If you miss some items for pattern matching, the compiler will issue a warning, and there will also be a warning for invalid items.
  
​
 [Detailed explanation here](https://github.com/sdzx-1/typed-fsm/blob/main/more-en.md).
 Do you have any suggestions?

I cannot get this program to work with the packages I am trying to install per the recommendations of a tutorial I am following. It would be really helpful if someone who knows what they are doing could help me on screen share with discord because I feel like I am close to fixing this because I think everything that is supposed to be installed is there and I feel like probably just one of my directory paths is wrong but I don't know where or how.
 I have posted on the tutorial and also asked on stack overflow and nothing has been helpful and I am just getting the same errors over and over. I just want to start coding but I can't because I can't even get this editor set up.

 Edit: I woke up with renewed vigor and I am going to try again when I get home from some obligatory human activities which unfortunately detract me from my goal of being a data spirit of some kind. Below is a copy of my relevant major file structure. "pmacs" is the HOME directory in my environment variables.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll preface by stating that I use project.el, and not projectile. Any solutions involving the latter won't do for me.
 In most other editors, you can create a file at the project root (or some other predefined path) that specifies settings and, among other things, launch commands.
 These commands are for anything related to the project, be it running, compiling, testing, debugging, whatever.
 I want something like this for emacs. So, I've been investigating possible ways to do it.
 I created a .dir-locals.el file on the project root. Emacs automatically loads this file. In it, I defined numerous variables with commands. I defined compile-command and created my own, like run-command and test-command.
 I would then need to create functions that read these variables and run their values, similar to how compile-command is handled. This would work just fine, but there's an issue.
 Since the variables I'm creating are unknown to emacs, it marks them as risky. So, what ends up happening is that every time you open a file where these variables would apply, you get a prompt asking you if you want to apply the variables.
 I managed to fix this by setting these variables as safe when giving them strings like this:
 (put 'compile-and-run-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) (put 'run-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) (put 'test-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) 
 And while this works, it irks me the wrong way, since this file would obviously be bundled with the project. So, if anyone else downloads this project and opens it with emacs, they won't have this extra config and they will be bugged by it, and for no good reason since they won't have the functions that use these variables anyway so it's of no use to them.
 So, I'm looking for a way to:
  
Define an arbitrary amount of commands to run on a project.
 Have this configuration loaded automatically.
 Not be a nuisance to third parties.
  
Any ideas?

 For example, if I do C-x C-f and start typing init.el, that should come before early-init.el.
 I seem to have gotten it working for the most part:
 (add-to-list 'ivy-sort-matches-functions-alist '(counsel-find-file . ivy-sort-function-buffer)) (add-to-list 'ivy-sort-matches-functions-alist '(ivy-switch-buffer . ivy-sort-function-buffer)) (add-to-list 'ivy-sort-matches-functions-alist '(counsel-projectile-find-file . ivy-sort-function-buffer)) 
 However, I'm still faced with execute-extended-command (i.e, M-x) not honoring my wish. What relevant ivy function should I look into to get this to work?
 Would there instead be a way for me to get it to work for all of them instead of individually?
 Edit: I was able to do it by enabling counsel-mode and the relevant function was counsel-M-x; however, I'm still curious if there is either (1) a better way (2) to do. this for all completions.

 It exports to LaTeX just fine, but not to ODT (which I need to get to a DOCX).

 The chunk of text seems mostly to be footnote related stuff. Here's a typical line:
 " 0 1 (:parent #18)))) (footnote-definition (:label "65" :begin 470440 :end 470472 :contents-begin 470448 :contents-end 470471 :pre-blank 0 :post-blank 1 :post-affiliated 470440 :mode nil :granularity nil :parent #16) (paragraph (:begin 470448 :end 470471 :contents-begin 470448 :contents-end 470471 :post-blank 0 :post-affiliated 470448 :mode nil :granularity nil :parent #17) #("Toll, " 0 6 (:parent #18)) (italic (:begin 7 :end 34 :post-blank 0 :contents-begin 8 :contents-end 33 :parent #18) #("The Entertainment Machine" 0 25 (:parent #19))) #(", 11." 0 5 (:parent #18)) #(" 
 I'm guessing my file has got a bad something somewhere, but I don't know where to look. 
 For what it's worth, every line of the *Messages* dump ends with "#("
 Has anybody faced anything similar before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce the release of Kele 0.5.0, the spritzy Kubernetes cluster management package for Emacs. Changelog is available here.
 This release integrates Kele with the menu bar. With this initial integration, you can switch Kubernetes contexts and default namespaces from within the menu bar. Kele presents your available contexts and namespaces as dynamic sub-menus, freeing you from the need to remember exact names and typing them in by hand (similar to kubectx and kubens on the terminal).

 With this release, Kele is now also integrated with doom-modeline. By adding the k8s segment to your doom-modeline configuration, you'll see current context and namespace information directly on the modeline. By clicking the segment, you can also access the menu bar, for the (menu-bar-mode -1) crowd.

 For more details, see the Kele documentation. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you'd like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.
 Thanks!

 As a follow up to this post I tried manually configuring the laravel-dev-tool server for blade templates.
 Here's my config (I'm using Doom):
 (after! lsp-mode (...) (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(web-mode . "blade")) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection (executable-find "laravel-dev-tools") "lsp") :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on "blade") :server-id 'bladels :priority -1))) 
 When I use this configuration and open a .blade.php file nothing happens. No server starts. It doesn't even try to start a server as I see no messages related to LSP.
 If I change the "blade" language to "html" (which is bound to html-ls) it starts the server successfully.
 So I'm guessing either I'm missing something or have something not configured correctly.
 Can someone please try and help me figure this out?
