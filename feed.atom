        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have programmed mainly in imperative and OOP languages like Python and C. Recently I have been taking a course on OCaml which introduced me to functional programming. I want to use this as a stepping stone to Haskell.
 To answer my question for example, I like the idea of [1..10] which will generate the list of ints quickly. I am not looking for very high level concepts like monads (which I am yet to understand), but more of these little things like [1..10] that are super convenient. Things for example you miss when using imperative languages or even other functional languages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am using GNU Emacs 28.0.92 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2022-03-27 on Windows 10.
 The problem is that many (not all!!) unicode-characters in e.b. text are not printed "as they are" but instead "encoded". Certain unicodes have no issue like Umlauts, eg. ö ä ü or ß are all displayed correctly and are properly "uni-"encoded using two bytes. 
 Problem can be seen here:
 ​

 and with many other unicode characters.
 File encoding info is:
 U -- utf-8-dos (alias: mule-utf-8-dos cp65001-dos) UTF-8 (no signature (BOM)) Type: utf-8 (UTF-8: Emacs internal multibyte form) EOL type: CRLF This coding system encodes the following charsets: unicode 
 The file is recognized as having unicode-encoding and saves properly preserving unicode.
 ​
 ​
 It is not a font issue, if I cat or more the file in terminal using the same font, the unicode characters get properly displayed.
 It is not an issue of Windows terminal, if I start emacs -nw from cmd.exe, powershell or Git Bash it's all the same (not from within Windows terminal)
 Note, when I open the same file using the same .emacs configuration in Gui-Mode all Unicode characters display correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used Haskell for a number of coding assignments. I compiled using ghci, and did not touch cabal at all. The system I ran on was managed by someone else and was taken down. I then tried to set things up on my own system, but was forced to abandon ghci for cabal run.
 After fiddling about in the .cabal file I could get rid of most compilation errors by adding depencies, but this one eludes me:
 Main.hs:3:1: error: Could not find module ‘Control.Monad.Par’ Perhaps you meant Control.Monad.Fail (from base-4.13.0.0) Control.Monad.Fix (from base-4.13.0.0) Control.Monad.RWS (needs flag -package-key mtl-2.2.2) Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. | 3 | import Control.Monad.Par | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
 It does not provide a dependency suggestion to add to my .cabal file, and the other options seem unrelated.
 Note that Control.Monad.Par should be there since this is part of an assignment and this file was given to us by the teacher.

 There's still a fe things Im working out, like how to get the status line to be more like doom's and such (Trying out mood-line right now), disable the gui menu and buttons and such, but it's working very well so far. 
 Plus color me weird, but I kinda like the lisp syntax, maybe I need to dig deeper in it. 
 Plus I got my emacs config placed into ~/.config/emacs but a lot of guides are saying I should use ~/.emacs.d does it really matter where my config is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, The Archive generates Zettel IDs that are not strictly compliant with with the latest ISO 8601 standard.  According to Wikipedia, since 2019 the ISO 8601 standard requires a "T" to be present between the date and time sections.  It would be great if ISO 8601 compliant Zettel IDs could be incorporated into a future release, preferably as a predefined native option.
I figure, if one is going to use a date and time stamp as an ID (and I can see the benefits of doing so), then the ID may as well be strictly ISO 8601 compliant.
I realise this is pedantic, not massively important, and can easily solved by other means (TextExpander, etc.).  It'd just be a nice touch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, r/haskell,
 We have been working on Chameleon: an interactive type-level debugging tool for Haskell. In 2020 I crowded sourced feedback and ideas on the designing Chameleon on Reddit. As a result, I was overwhelmed by a generous amount of participation and lots of constructive feedback from the wholesome r/haskell community. This time we are running an extended study with more advanced interactive features of Chameleon.
 If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming tool research or checking out our Haskell type-level interactive tools, please click this link to proceed https://blend.ercu.be/consent. We use telemetrics to gather usage data for this study, but it is totally anonymous. We won't ask you for personal data (email, name, phone number, etc.). It will take you about 20 - 30 minutes to complete. But in turn, it will help us immensely.
 If you are interested in this research, there're links to the paper and video at ICFP 2021. You can also check out our repository on Github.
 Thank you,
 Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team

 I came across this neat looking thing in the treemacs repo.
 ​
 Does anyone know of a package or a way to get minibuffer to look like this? I mean, the position of it to be somewhere else, not necessarily docked at the bottom?
 Thank you! Love emacs

 I have a program that someone else has written. If I run in from the python shell then it works fine. But afterwards that python shell is useless, it won't respond to inputs. (Simple scripts don't suffer from this problem.)
 Why am I asking about this here? It doesn't do this outside of Emacs. If start a python shell from a Windows cmd window then the python shell continues working after the program has ended.
 Has anyone seen anything like this before?

Then, if Luhmann wanted to insert a note in the system, he'd append a letter running from "a":
First note
Second note
Now, what happens, if Luhmann wanted to insert another new note between note 1 and 1a?  I'm assuming I have misunderstood how his system works, but I can't see what label the new note can be given as there's nothing that can now come before "1a".  Can anyone clarify?]]></summary>

 Is this possible using footnotes? I didn't find an option to set the target location of the footnotes section, or a way to group them per (sub)section.
 I could use internal links instead, using ^{[[note1]]} in the table and a list of notes 1. <<note>> some note below the table, but this doesn't give backlinks. (I suppose I could manually add a link in the other direction but sounds like a lot of effort, while using footnotes is very simple.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I'm trying to setup emacs to edit and compile verilog sources remotely. I'm using TRAMP to do this. Editing files runs great, but I don't know how to setup the compile commands to run the verilog parser remotely using emacs compile. Emacs tries to compile it locally.
 -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: "/ssh:user@odcvde:/slowfs/265/users/user/FM_Debugging_Hard_Verifications/hv_labs/lab5/rtl/" -*- Compilation started at Thu Mar 31 16:02:33 /bin/sh: line 2: /ssh:user@odcvde:vlogan: No such file or directory 
 It disobeys also the default shell using sh instead of bash
 Also, misc stuff, I'm having problems with TRAMP and the bash prompt. It initially have problems to detect the prompt, It had bold characters, so I worked around it adding * to the prompt regexp and worked again, but I noticed that there's still some garbage in the shell. Is forcing certain terminal type or changing the prompt a more "robust" solution? 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Spacemacs with the Twilight-bright theme, as I like how it uses the background colour in highlights.
 When I run Emacs directly via X, everything works fine but, when I try to use it on a terminal, in some cases the minibuffer text shows the same colour as the background (white), so I can't see anything. One of the examples is trying to open a file in a project with C-x C-f, the minibuffer seems to show the same as the selection in Helm (judging on how the cursor shows at the same location as in the Helm window and it changes when I move up and down) but I can't see what's there.
 It seems to work fine for things like showing me function details from LSP.
 I've looked at the twilight-bright.el and I've not found anything.
 Note: I've been doing some more testing and it looks like the issue is not only related to twilight-bright, but it seems to be related to spacemacs itself.
 The issue happens both, on terminals with white on black and black on white.
 Anybody got any ideas on how to fix this issue or other themes to try?

Modeling PlusCal in Haskell using Cartesian products of NFAs by Gabriella Gonzalez
PlusCal is a formal specification language created to model concurrent systems, and recently I became obsessed with implementing PlusCal as an embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) in Haskell.

 Is this expected?
 Can I not restrict the profiling to just my own code?
 Is this a one time thing or will it happen for every new Cabal project?
 I guess the newly installed packages include ways for the RTS to get detailed information from every module, does this add any overhead for a program running without profiling?

we needed to run the GHC test suite and look for interesting errors to

running the unmodified GHC test suite while treating WebAssembly
modules like native executables transparently. The trick may come in
handy if one needs to run a combination of host/guest hybrid code in
their codebase.

A WebAssembly module as an executable
Let’s first clarify why we can treat a WebAssembly module as an
executable file.
Despite the “Web” prefix in its name, the WebAssembly core
specification isn’t related to browsers at all; it merely
defines a bytecode format that describes some computation. The only

 I've been using Emacs for 8 years now. I stopped fiddling with my config maybe 3-4 years ago as I became jaded having things break all the time for no apparent reason and getting bored fixing stuff
 But now I am using LSP mode for the first time. I think it is amazing. I am using 
 One problem: it assumes Python 2 for some reason. 
 Example: when mousing over a return type annotation (underlined with red to suggest an error) it says:
 invalid syntax, return annotations require 3.x 
 But I want/wish to use Python 3.10. How do i configure this? How do I make sure it's using the Python I want and the environment (i.e. the libraries) I want too? 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading the "async" article from FPComplete (https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/library/async/), at the end of the article it gives a "final exercise: implement mapConcurrently using mapConcurrently_".
 According to documentation (https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-13.21/unliftio-0.2.10/UnliftIO-Async.html), the signature of mapConcurrently is as follows:
 mapConcurrently :: MonadUnliftIO m => Traversable t => (a -> m b) -> t a -> m (t b)
 I've implemented mapConcurrently for lists (as a special case of Traversable), so the question is how do I generalize my solution to cover all traversables.
 Is there a way to create a Traversable without knowing its concrete type? I think I'd need to add another typeclass as a constraint, but changing function's type doesn't seem right.
 Also I'm curious about other ways to implement mapConcurrently using mapConcurrently_.
 ```

 -- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script {-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-} import RIO import Test.Hspec import Control.Concurrent.STM (check) import Data.List (sortBy) import Data.Ord (comparing) import Prelude (putStrLn)

 console.log(newUrl.toString() == "https://google.com/test1/test2.png") // true ```
 But I cannot figure out how to achieve similar with Haskell.

This means that you can set up things like parsers combinators that can be "viewed" as an abstract grammar, in addition to a parser.
 (An issue of course is that, when using arrows, you can't use the outputs of an arrow to determine what effects to imply. If you could, it would mean you can't statically analyze which effects are going to be dispatched. To do that would mean introducing "higher order arrows" aka ArrowApply, which i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SWAR (SIMD in register) techniques were used in the last release of jsoniter-scala to speed up parsing and serialization on JVM platforms.
 VarHandles from Java 11+ gave access to byte arrays for loading 64-bit values of subsequent 8 bytes and storing 8/4/2-byte values.
 It allowed saving on load/store ops and parallel processing of bytes of JSON input/output. Also, it mitigates redundant index checks when storing bytes to byte arrays sequentially in GraalVM CE.
 Results of benchmarks from Intel® Core™ i9-11900H are here as usually.
 BTW, If you had a positive experience with the library that saved your time due to handy derivation, reduced compilation time of your project due to efficiency of derivation macros, or reduced your spending on infrastructure due to efficient parsing and serialization, then please support its development and testing on different platforms by:
  
sponsoring my account on GitHub
 
mentioning jsoniter-scala in articles and video records
 
sending your feedback to Gitter chat or GitHub issues

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using markdown-mode and have the following custom keybinds:
  
C-b puts **|** (| is the cursor), so that the text is bold
 C-i puts *|* so that the text is italic
  
The problem is that I often get in this kind of situation: ( | represents the cursor) 
  
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, **consectetur adipiscing |** elit, sed do eiusmod 
  
When I type something between the asterisks I always leave an appending whitespace inside, before getting out of the enclosing asterisks. 
 One solution could be to interpret a double space as "get out of the enclosing asterisks". This way, if I type another space in the example above, this would be the result:
  
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, **consectetur adipiscing**| elit, sed do eiusmod
  
I'd like this to be possible even for backticks. However, it doesn't seem like an easy task (I'm not a elisp expert, but i could make it through its particular syntax). Is there some hint or already built tool out there that could help me? Thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a challenge problem on the kattis website called Pivot that has a concise solution using a bit of reverse state. Since forward state is needed as well, it's a natural fit for the Tardis monad
 The sample list is:
  
2 1 3 4 7 5 6 8
  
At each element we're to determine if it's greater than the elements before (prior state) and less than the elements remaining (future state). With tardis you can do both at once:
 check :: Int -> Tardis Int Int Bool check num = do modifyForwards (`max` num) modifyBackwards (`min` num) p <- getPast f <- getFuture pure $ p <= num && num < f -- this is a pivot if it's between the prior -- maximum and the future minimum

I finished an interview process for a relatively big company (1000-2000 employees, 5-10 offices), as a remote scala backend developer and they gave me an offer. They said the salary I want is for seniors and the max I can get is ~€50k.
 Do you have any trustable salary sources? The most I found are published by recruiter companies and I think they tend to say a bit more than it would be realistic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, r/orgmode!
 Since citations in orgmode are now native (hurray!), I've come to wonder whether it is possible to use the same document as the source for the citations.
 Via org-babel blocks it is possible to write a bibliography in orgmode and tangle it to a bib-file. This mechanism is sufficient if you decide to use only one or two org documents for literature summaries, reading lists etc. like Gregory Stein does. But it becomes unwieldy, if you want to use a single file per book/article with self-contained bibliographic information, because you have to create a lot of single bibliographies, that clutter up the org-folder.
 The selfcontainment of bibliographic information seems very attractive for me because single files can be shared without thinking about needed supplementary files. Further, it would be possible to copy bibliographic entries between files and create project-specific bib-files for LaTeX use, without having a huge bibfile, of which the most part stays unused, and still have a consistent bib-key.
 As far as I can see Nicolas Rougier's org-bib-mode doesn't do that, but uses a corresponding bib-file.
 Do you know ways to achieve that or do you think it's a rather stupid idea, that brings a lot of hassle with it?
 Thank you!

 Hello Community,
 Over the past few weeks I've been working on a new server-side microframework called Okapi (I'm open to name suggestions).
 Okapi is a monadic parser, but for HTTP requests. It's inspired by F#'s Giraffe and the simplicity of web frameworks in other programming languages like Python and Ruby. It's meant to be a simple, idiomatic alternative to other frameworks in the Haskell ecosystem. A summary of what Okapi is can be found here.
 If you're interested in testing Okapi out, take a look at the documentation. I recommend going through the crash course (still finishing it) to get a feel for what you can do with this library.
 To see an example of what a web server built with Okapi looks like, take a look at this implementation of the realworld backend spec. You can use it to compare it to other implementations of the same spec. The Okapi implementation passes all the required tests and is a good idea of what you can expect from the framework.
 Okapi is still in the early experimental stage, so I would highly recommend NOT to use it for production projects or important side projects. The API is subject to major changes. The main reason why I want to show Okapi to the community this early in its' development is to get feedback as soon as possible to make sure this is something worth investing more time into. I'd love to hear opinions from Haskellers and non-Haskellers of all skill levels and backgrounds.
 If you'd like to open an issue or PR, the repo is here. Contributions are more than welcome.
 Here are some more interesting links:

 Even better, IMHO would be something akin to how git command work. Namely, by simply having a script on your path named git-*, that script is interpreted as a sub command. So git-stuff would allow git stuff. A similar mechanism in cabal might allow us to experiment with new commands without having to modify cabal itself, not entirely unlike how extensions allow us to experiment with new Haskell features in GHC.

I messed around with forwarding the server socket over ssh, but it turns out that emacsclient will just try and get the server to do stuff on its end. In other words, emacsclient is just an RPC call, not a thin client.
 X forwarding is way too slow.
 Anyone got any other ideas?
 if it wasn't clear - I want emacs running on my server, with a GUI on my laptop.
 I'm envisioning something like a web app - backend <=> frontend

 So, my specific questions are:
  
Could someone share their working setup for pyls over tramp?
 Could someone share their working setup for some other lsp-server working with lsp-mode over tramp?

I think this distinction adds to the conversation about whether or not the zettelkasten produces writing itself or is a writing partner. My method falls in the latter. But the true answer falls to user needs and user experience, I expect.
The Zettelkasten is my conversation partner in the process of constructing a draft.

 i just finished my config of Mu4e for my work mail. I synced everything with offlineimap and indexed the folder with mu. When i open Inbox, some mails from Sent Items also appear in there. First i thought i have opened a bookmark or so, but this is not the Case. In the Bottom it says: 'R maildir:"/INBOX"'.
 When i open an email, the ones actually located in inbox have "Maildir: /INBOX" in the header. But i also have mails with "Maildir: /Sent Items" in the Header. Those emails are not send via emacs, but from my previous client.
 Here is my init.el mu4e part.
 (use-package mu4e :ensure nil ;; :load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e/" ;; :defer 20 ; Wait until 20 seconds after startup :config ;; This is set to 't' to avoid mail syncing issues when using mbsync (setq mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving t) ;; Refresh mail using isync every 10 minutes (setq mu4e-update-interval (* 5 60)) (setq mu4e-get-mail-command "offlineimap -c /home/user/.offlineimaprc") (setq mu4e-maildir "~/.mail/workmail") (setq user-mail-address "workmail") (setq mu4e-drafts-folder "/Drafts") (setq mu4e-sent-folder "/Sent Items") (setq mu4e-refile-folder "/INBOX.2022") (setq mu4e-trash-folder "/Deleted Items") (setq mu4e-maildir-shortcuts '(("/INBOX" . ?i) ("/Sent Items" . ?s) ("/Deleted Items" . ?d) )) (mu4e t) )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a stupd issue where I cannot override view-mode-map keys for some reason.
 The code I want to use is below. F13 binding is working but the others aren't.  (setq view-read-only t) (global-set-key (kbd "<f13>") 'view-mode) (with-eval-after-load 'view-mode (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "f") #'forward-char) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "n") #'next-line) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "p") #'previous-line)) 
 If I remove the with-eval-after-load and just add the following
  (setq view-read-only t) (global-set-key (kbd "<f13>") 'view-mode) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "f") #'forward-char) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "n") #'next-line) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "p") #'previous-line)) 
 Then I get: Symbol's value as variable is void: view-mode-map.
 I'm still a noob so I might be overlooking something really simple here, any help, please? Thanks in advanced!
 EDIT: forgot to mention that it that if I go to my init file and eval-region on the define-key lines after Emacs loads, it works just fine. I’m also overriding other maps like dired and some others in a similar way and they also work fine.
 EDIT 2: I am trying to replicate this https://gist.github.com/ivan-krukov/63a586f2121519ca51b201c634402a84 but without use-package.

 Can I have emacs trigger a command when I type a specific string in insert mode*? In my use-case I would like my citations keys to become auto-completed somehow when I type '@'.
 '@' is the prefix for citation and references in pandocs markdown. Citation look like '@Nurmagomedov2020' for example, and they are stored in a bibtex file. I currently search and add citations by calling citar-insert-citation, which provides an interface to search my bibtex file and prefix the '@' symbol so that is recognised by pandoc, when I create a document.
 Using completion plugins clearly it is possible for typed text to trigger a function (the completion). Is there a way I can make this work for my citation entry? Alternatively, is there an alternative approach for my specific use case that someone has already implemented?
 Any guidance appreciated, even just a link in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm trying to make a function that goes to an intended place at the beginning of an org-file. I would use point-min, but that will insert the new snippet before the headers; I am using goto-line but that will break if I change how big the headers are. Is there no way to essentially say, "Go to the first heading, now go back a little more?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From this discussion, /u/github-alphapapa suggests the possibility of adding the following to the org-mode-hook:
 (when (s-prefix? (expand-file-name "~/org/") (buffer-file-name (current-buffer)) ) (real-auto-save-mode) ) 
 The provides the feature of limiting the real-auto-save-mode to his ~/org/ directory. I'd like to do this (or something similar), but my current cut-and-paste level of elisp knowledge certainly wouldn't work:
 (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (when (s-prefix? (expand-file-name "~/org/") (buffer-file-name (current-buffer))) (real-auto-save-mode)) ) 
 How would I add that functionality to my org-mode-hook?
 Also, what if I might want to extend that to also include some additional arbitrary file or dir? In particular, I might want to add my ~/.emacs.d/init.el, but maybe something else as well!

 I'm pleased to announce that base16, base32, and base64 have been updated to support GHC 9.2.x. In the most recent versions, due to GHC issue #20338 in which targetByteOrder was incorrect on Big Endian architectures, the required GHC version lower bound has been upped to GHC 8.10.x. Versions of GHC 8.10.x were silently patched at some point to fix this behavior. 
 Cheers,

 How did you choose between the two?

First post here!
I am newer to trying out note-taking within the set up the Archive and the Method as proposed on this website.
As I’m seeking to prioritize connections at the beginning, I’m seeing different opportunities. However, I’m finding it difficult in the prose. This makes establishing the connections difficult.
For example, today I was reading about deliberate  practice and how immediate feedback is necessary within the practice session. I thought about how I can make a connection to other notes within the archive. I had another note about failure as a teacher that came from my readings on Toyota and their leadership practices. However, I didn’t know a good way to write out a good connection.
If it would help for me to post the contents of those notes in here I’d be happy to.
Any thoughts on how to do this naturally?]]></summary>

 Is there a way to create a named function, and then use something like an org link to execute the function?
 Specific Use Case
 I have a list of items that serve as the basis for my weekly and monthly reviews. The review document is bullet list with short prompts and links to other files. (e.g., research, notes, agenda, goals, etc).
 However I'm using perspective.el to separate my project management, research and creative work into separate window collections. I would like to add a link that takes me into the relevant perspective rather than simply loading the file or buffer into the current perspective with an org-link.
 If this was webdev, I could add a JavaScript click handler. Is there a simple way to accomplish this without new key-bindings?

 It automatically calculates and applies a point size to the frame's default face, based on monitor size and pixel pitch. I find it invaluable as I switch between a large 4k desk monitor and the laptop when mobile, and presenting on big screens in meeting rooms.
 I just added it to MELPA, and converted it to a minor mode, so anyone already using it will have to tweak config to change (textsize-setup) to (textsize-mode).
 I'd be very happy to hear about issues or desired features (here or on Github). I don't encounter displays that don't report size, but presumably projectors are not reliable for this - is there good generic metadata I could use to detect and compensate for them? At worst I could add overrides by EDID (unique display identifier).
 Also, while the default parameters I came up with work for me, there are many display geometries I just haven't encountered that may be sub-optimal with the defaults(?).

 Total emacs noob here, using doom as a launchpad into the wider world of lisp operating systems...
 I want to open notmuch in tree view by default. When I put this into my config:
 (setq +notmuch-home-function (lambda () (notmuch-tree "tag:inbox")))
 I get this error:
 Symbol’s function definition is void: notmuch-tree
 It seems notmuch-tree is only available from within a notmuch-buffer. How can I access it programmatically from the outside?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/emacs, long time Vim user here trying to make the switch to Emacs and get it to stick (this time). And one of the recommendations I've seen when it comes to successfully switching is to figure out your emacs workflow and patterns rather than trying to shove Vim into Emacs (evil-mode aside).
 One of the core parts of my Vim workflow was fuzzy finding a file (any file, anywhere) in a project. And I see that there's a way to get similar functionality with projectile or project.el. The problem I've found is on large projects it's too slow, and breaks my focus. But this got me thinking. I very rarely need to jump between many far flung regions of the project I'm working on. And actually, having to search through all files in the project (as quick as it may be) gets annoying in my Vim workflow where there are many files with the same or similar names. 
 So instead, what I'm imagining would work well for me is to fuzzy search for all files in a sub directory of a project. I.e: in executing a custom project-find-file I would first get the option to find a subdir in the project, and then it would operate as regular project-find-file from that subdir.
 Being new to emacs/elisp are there any pointers for how to do this, I would imagine ideally with project.el? Or alternatively, how do you deal with navigating to files quickly (without breaking your focus/flow) in large projects with emacs?
 Thanks in advance! 🙏

 Here is an example of how to use Generically1 to derive an instance:
 type Foo :: Type -> Type data Foo a = Foo [a] a (Int -> Int -> Maybe a) deriving stock Generic1 deriving (Functor, Applicative) via Generically1 Foo 
 While this derives a specific instance it is by no means unique. By the magic of Applicative every such instance has a backwards instance via Backwards (Generically1 Foo) where the applicative effects run in reverse order.
 Generically1 works for a lot of Applicatives but it does not work for sum types. Right off the bat this excludes lists, ZipLists, NonEmpty-lists…]]></summary>

So I expected emacs to just load as normal. Why did it open loaddefs.el? And what is that file?

I've read many posts, looked at countless configuration files, and have really gotten a lot out of all the discussions that go on here. Now that I've finally gotten comfortable with Org Mode, I decided to spend a week writing down a tutorial for new people. This is the tutorial that I wished I had found when I was starting out trying to make sense of all this. 
 I've written a very detailed explanation of my workflow and various Org Mode configurations. It includes screenshots as well as code samples with comments. Please take a look at it and let me know how I can better refine it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a new Haskell book being published by No Starch Press called Functional Programming for Physics Geeks which just recently went into early access. The book is the culmination of the author's decades of experience teaching computational physics using functional programming and it covers Newtonian mechanics and electromagnetism all in Haskell, with emphasis on using strong static typing and compositionality to implement the core ideas of kinematics and dynamics. The author also has a library of code used in the book on Hackage here.
 Personally I love books using Haskell in application areas that are outside the field of software engineering, like van Eijck and Unger's Computational Semantics with Functional Programming, so I am very much looking forward to this book and I thought others might be too. Relive the horrors of undergrad physics, but this time in Haskell!
 I know that the author has written about using Haskell to teach physics before and has been working on this book for a while so maybe people have seen it before but didn't know it was slated to come out this year. The page for the book had been live for a little bit last year but then it disappeared. However it seems to be back up now because early access for the book has opened. The last time I talked to the author he said the goal date for publication was in May, but it seems to be pushed back to October this year.
 (NB I'm not involved in any way with the book, I'm just excited for it and hadn't seen it mentioned yet.)

 I love Diagrams and Gloss libraries in haskell. I wanted to try making something that will enable anyone/me to use it in other programming languages for quick scripts – for drawing simple geometric shapes and animations.
 mindra talks via stdin/stdout, so integrating with it should be easy. So far I have one client library (https://github.com/rorokimdim/mindra-clj) for Clojure.
 I’m at the beginner level in haskell. I’d appreciate any kind of feedback (either on mindra or the haskell code in general). Thanks for reading!

 While encrypting individual headers or entire files is fine and all, I find it rather cumbersome when trying to write something that isn't meant to be entirely encrypted and still structurally have it make sense. With org-mode being hierarchical and all, I can't really just make another heading and then go back to the parent header at some arbitrary point. From what I've understood, adding new babel blocks is rather easy, but I'm not sure if it'd be easy or hard to implement something like this for org crypt. I think it'd be nice to have though.

It’s more like a very long mumble that you can respond to. There will be no right answers, and please let me know what you think of each of the ideas here!
 Background: I do a lot of machine learning and data analysis, which means I have to use python and R on remote servers a lot. I’ve been trying to find a good workflow from my laptop in emacs. 
 These servers usually have very different dependencies from my laptop since they have GPUs. For example, pytorch, a machine learning learning library, uses different versions for machines with and without GPU. This makes direct sharing of virtual environments or poetry projects difficult.

Last Week
More reading and onboarding "Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson." This is filled with rich material and I'm taking my time.
I'm most excited about the development of a proximity search tool! Having this as a Keyboard Maestro macro is making it useful. Easier and more beautiful searches for interconnecting ideas in my ZK.
This Week
Restarted going to the public gym.
Reorg backpacking gear in prep for this year. First trip in 2 weeks.
Continued onboarding to my ZK "Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson."
Using The Archive to write a review of:


Bricker-Caplan, Nora. Long May They Reign - The Atavist Magazine. 2020.



Trivia
These are the titles of the last few notes I've created in my ZK. Show me yours! We be interested in seeing what you are up to even if you have one or two newish zettel to share!

 I use emacs doom from a mac, starting it with emacs -nw (inside the tab), as I have a really compact keyboard sometimes I press shortcuts I am not aware of, and often the terminal I have been working get closed and I lose all the data I was working on.
 I saw on the internet I can use `recover-file` but there are not trace of my previous changes, I lost already hours of data dozens of times in few months of org usage. Also when I use c-x u or even worse just U, then something can go wrong with redo and also I lose data. This never happen in intellij or inserting data in excel or other basic ide. Please do you know a plugin can save me from that, if things keep going as that I have to renounce to use org mode for important info, and I do not want that.

 ​
 add the following packages and their setting in your config:
 ​
 automatice garbage collection on idle
 https://github.com/emacsmirror/gcmh
 ​
 make lsp lighter and faster
 https://ianyepan.github.io/posts/emacs-ide/
 ​
 is your emacs blinding white. Add the following package in your config and
 their settings:
 ​
 add a darker theme to emacs
 https://github.com/doomemacs/themes
 ​
 optionally:
 you can try out gccemacs which has native compilation 
 if you are on any linux distro
 ​
 https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GccEmacs
 ​
 General advice:
 ​
 set the value of gcmh-high-cons-threshold to a suitable value of
 your choice do not set it to very high values as it will
 not have any performance gains acorrding to the below post.
 minimum value if you are an lsp user "100000000".
 ​
 https://bling.github.io/blog/2016/01/18/why-are-you-changing-gc-cons-threshold/
 ​
 Also do not set the value of gc-cons-threshold value in lsp package
 :config option as this value is set automatically by gcmh package
 ​
 never turn your back again to emacs. emacs is awesome!!! :)
 ​
 NOTE:
 ​
 The above post is not to cause fights or to raise any political agendas.
 This is just an opinion and help by myside to any user struggling with
 emacs performance issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had originally posted this on r/spacemacs, but someone mentioned that it might be better addressed here. Thanks in advance for any thoughts!
 ***
 I've been using Spacemacs for a month or so and am really enjoying the experience. I originally wanted to learn Emacs because of Org-Mode, but have since started doing most of my writing in a markdown buffer using writeroom-mode, where I previously just wrote with Vim in a terminal.
 I'm using a standard US keyboard on a 2013 Macbook Pro (still going strong), but I use ä ü ö ß all the time. The situation is basically exactly what is outlined in this older post. I have had the same key combinations baked into my fingers for years and I'd like to keep it that way. Right now, I have this in my user-config:
 (setq ns-alternate-modifier 'none
 ns-right-alternate-modifier 'meta)
 It works wonderfully, all good, I thought. But now at some point the umlauts go haywire: for example, ä eventually becomes \303\244 and I'm not sure what could be triggering the change or how to fix it. I get that it's UTF-8, but why it ends up like that in the first place is beyond me. Is there an obvious fix here or something that I'm missing? Thanks in advance for any input.
 UPDATE: 
 The link that u/graduale posted ended up being super helpful, as it was indeed some sort of encoding issue having something to do with the existence of the "null-bytes" as discussed in that thread. Found them with C-s C-q C-SPC, got rid of them and using revert-buffer-with-coding-system cleaned everything up after I selected the encoding. And the change seems to be holding after restarting emacs completely as well. Thanks for the help!

I thought it was just an inevitable drawback of emulating a terminal in Emacs, until today I discovered that "vterm-timer-delay"'s default value is 0.1.
 Setting it to nil makes vterm as snappy as any other external emulators I've used.
 Does anybody know why it's set to 0.1 by default? Prevent performance issues?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need some help coming up with a table formula to count how many of a certain string are in each column of a table.
 For example, given an org-mode table like this:
 |-----+-----+-----| | Foo | Bar | Baz | |-----+-----+-----| | Y | N | abc | | N | Y | def | | Y | N | ghi | |-----+-----+-----| 
 I'd like to count how many "Y" are in each column, to create this result:
 |-----+-----+-----| | Foo | Bar | Baz | |-----+-----+-----| | Y | N | abc | | N | Y | def | | Y | N | ghi | |-----+-----+-----| | 2 | 1 | 0 | |-----+-----+-----| 
 As a bonus, it'd be nice to be able to determine what percentage of the total number of lines in the table (excluding the header, result lines, and separators) contain "Y", resulting in:
 |-----+-----+-----| | Foo | Bar | Baz | |-----+-----+-----| | Y | N | abc | | N | Y | def | | Y | N | ghi | |-----+-----+-----| | 2 | 1 | 0 | | 67 | 33 | 0 | |-----+-----+-----| 
 Of course, this should work with any number of rows and columns.

 Hey all,
 flymake-swi-prolog is an Emacs package implementing a simple Flymake backend for SWI-Prolog, it provides diagnostics about Prolog source code in prolog-mode buffers.
 Here's how it may look when you write some code that makes no sense:
 flymake-swi-prolog
 This is the first Emacs package I've authored, I use Emacs a lot but I haven't written a lot of Elisp outside of my config file before, so the implementation is mostly based on the example backend from the Flymake manual. Any comments or suggestions are welcome!
 Under the hood, flymake-swi-prolog uses diagnostics.pl, which is a tiny Prolog package I've written to expose the diagnosis performed by the SWI-Prolog built-in IDE in a way that is both human-readable and easy enough for me to consume from Elisp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Zettlers,
does anyone speak (write and read) Sanskrit? If yes, how does it feel compared to English or other languages you speak?
I am asking because I think about learning Sanskrit to improve my thinking.
Example: To me, German is very sensitive compared to English. In German, tiny differences in wording make a huge difference in meaning and tone. English is much more simple.
A (translated) quote that is very telling:

  
French is a noble park, Italian a big, bright and colourful wood. But German is more like a primeval forest, as thick and mysterious, as lacking big trails and yet full of hidden paths. You can’t get lost in a park, and not that easily and dangerously in the Italian wood’s brightness; but in German can disappear in the thicket within four, five minutes. Because the paths are so difficult to follow, most try to march as straight as possible through it. Actually, this is against it’s against the nature of this language. Sure, it has a principal direction, but yet invites by hundred trails and hidden paths left and right to depart from it, and soon back to it.



I butchered the quote through translation because it makes heavy use of the peculiarities of the German language.
That is the reason why translations from German into English are very difficult.
That is the reason why I plan to provide my own translation of the core texts of Luhmann in some distant future.
Live long and prosper

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, in an endeavor to truly understand the difference between a REPL and an interactive shell, I've came across this article On Repl-Driven Programming (hackernews comments). The author described two important features that Lisp REPLs have and other languages such as Python/Ruby lack. These two features are:
  
breakloop. If you call an undefined function, the debugger will be in a breakloop (what the L in REPL truly stands for), and in there you can edit the code, without restarting the function call. In emacs if would of be like if we encounter a (void-variable foo) error and the debugger pops up. And then we recursively edit the source code and then the debugger will go back one step in the stack and the code runs like no error has happened.
 
hot reloading. If you define a class, and instantiate a few instances, changing the class definition while the program is running will dynamic be reflected on the instances without restarting the REPL. In emacs, I feel like the main emacs runtime already has some of this using eval-defun or eval-sexp, but it's not as automatic as other languages mentioned. 
 
  
My questions are: 
 Do we have breakloop and hot reloading in Emacs? Are there any other tricks that Emacs has for REPL-driven development? 
 Thanks!

Most recently someone was asking a very specific question about searching, and it was clear that they were using a specific package, but it wasn't at all obvious to me what package it was.  I spent several seconds in confusion, trying to work it out. (It was, apparently, a thing called "The Archive", which I've never seen.)

I could just include them and run ghci and it would run without a hassle and I could do this without fiddling around with Cabal. Just compile and run any file without bothering about project configs and whatever.
 Since moving to my laptop and trying to do the same here, I consistently get messages about missing modules.
 Example:
 "Could not find module ‘Control.Monad.Par’"
 I've tried reading about how to do it, but introductory guides to Cabal all talk about setting up project stuff, which was not at all necessary on the old system. On the old system I could create a .hs file wherever I wanted and compile it with ghc/ghci easily. I did not need to set up Cabal projects to do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs has lots of features and lots of packages written for it.
 There should be a webpage demonstrating such features and packages with a short description and instantly viewable video demos, so browsing users could instantly see how a feature works without installing anything. Such a page could be a great way to demonstrate Emacs' capabilites.
 VSCode has such a page, here it is: https://vscodecandothat.com
 Instead of youtube videos animated gifs can work too like in this page which demonstrates Helm's capabilities with text and animgifs:
 https://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html
 There is this list, but it's only text:
 https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs
 Having animgif demos is important, because then the user can instantly see the value of a feature without installing and configuring it first.
 Such a page could be shown to new users, so they can browse it and find useful packages which they may not find otherwise for a long time.
 The community could create a page like this by people contributing animgifs demoing their favorite features and collecting these on a webpage.

In most posts that I see about this, a person that's usually fairly new to org-mode will lament org-mode's default flat-ish method of archiving, in which the original parent tree context is set as a property. Then discussion about how to do it that way, either through a function or through project management (only archive once the project is closed out), separate files per project, etc.
 What I'd like to know is who among you prefers the default flat-ish method for archiving, and how does that work for you? How do you resolve the typical objections to that method, which drives people to seek out a tree-mimicking approach?

 I am trying to write a sort of repl for a hex editor. The work of the hex editor is irrelevent. I have some functions all of them return an Either String (String, Core) where Core contains information about the current state of the program. In order to execute those functions, I store the functions and the commands that correspond to them in a Map String (String -> Either String (String, Core)) but this doesn't work that well because the user may want to load a file into the program meaning that some functions may be IOs so what would be a better way to do what I want (without having to make everything IO)?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following class:
 class Entity a id where getId :: a -> id 
 I use this class to represent data that have an identity, so for example:
 data Person = Person { id :: Int, name :: String } instance Entity Person Int where getId = Person.id 
 This instance allows me to compare Persons even if they changed their name. What I have noticed is that in several places in my code, I'm repeating the same comparison:
 (getId personInThePast) == (getId samePerson) 
 It would be great if I could write the following:
 personInThePast === samePerson 
 The idea would be that the compiler would know it should just compare their IDs. I can make an Eq instance of Person, but if I follow that path, I would repeat the same code for all my Entity. Since I know how to equate any Entity, I thought that I could write an Eq instance for my Entity class, but the compiler complains that Entity is a constraint, so now I don't know how to implement this. Any help?

 I use this to include long code block, it has its own file outside of org mode. For short codes, I tried to use org babel. I want this org babel, when exported, to have the same listing style as above, when you include from outside. This answer suggests doing:
 #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{listings} #+LATEX_HEADER: \lstdefinestyle{BashInputStyle}{language=bash,basicstyle=\large\ttfamily, numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,numbersep=3pt,frame=tb} Normal include code from outside #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex \lstinputlisting[language=Python,style=BashInputstyle]{hello.py} #+END_EXPORT Now org babel block #+ATTR_LATEX: :options style=BashInputStyle #+BEGIN_SRC bash echo "hello world" #+END_SRC 
 I tried and got error, in fact it rendered incorrectly. This is my log and resulting tex file.

 Obviously this is an infinite loop, but I thought it would be fun to share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I record a sequence of keystrokes with start-kbd-macro and call it, emacs replays all keystrokes immediately. However I want it to replay keystrokes exactly as I typed them. So that calling the macro looked less like a shortcut and more like if a ghost writer was typing it. Adding intervals between keystrokes during playback won't suffice. How can I preserve the original delays between inputs? 
 upd: random intervals between keystrokes won't suffice either. Do you know of any existing package that records both the keystrokes and original delays?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am trying to build a parser to parse command line arguments of the following form.
 ​
 -verbose -leftString STRING -rightString STRING 
 Two of the arguments take a parameter of type String. If some of them i snot specified, I have default values for them (in my structure Arguments {verbose :: Bool, leftString :: Maybe String, rightString :: Maybe String}I would use False, Nothing, Nothing.
 However, the flag (the argument) can be specified more then once, in which case the last flag is decisive (i.e. "./program -leftString foo -leftString bar" would become Arguments False "bar" Nothing after parsing).
 ​
 I know, how to do a parser for each of these options returning Parser Bool (or Parser String, respectively). But how do I make them run repeatedly until all of them fail (the arguments do not need to be in any particular order, so I have to try all of them for each argument). I could achieve that by using something like many $ choice [...], but that doesn't let me to gradually update the parsed values (if more flags, only last flag value is kept).
 ​
 Or, I could use something like optional in sequence where I set the default value to the last parsed (or the default one if no parsed value yet). But optional always succeeds and I would never know if this is the last time I succeeded and I should stop parsing.
 ​
 What can I do?

 This Emacs configuration aims to be uncluttered, clean, vanilla, and practically useful for any day-to-day tasks.
 It only has the absolute necessary configurations, tailored to be minimal w/ vanilla keybindings, practical and useful. It is easy to add any additional feature and package later if you need one.
 There are several reasons for keeping the configuration to a bare minimum, one is that it’s easier to keep track of all the packages and keystrokes. It is better to have a setup that you use 90% of the time, than having a cluttered setup that will just make it difficult to keep up with gazillions of preinstalled packages that usually end-up being unused.
 This configuration tries not to be a one-size-fits all configuration, but it tries to be an Emacs configuration that suits most of the developers, and I keep it personable, clean, easy and sensible.

reserves, and 13 issues in total, but failed to find this one.

How It Happened
The heart of the vulnerability lies in this seemingly harmless
function which checks that a given value possesses a single unit of an
asset class:
isUnity :: Value -> AssetClass -> Bool
isUnity v c = assetClassValueOf v c == 1

While harmless in isolation, in the context it was used isUnity
revealed itself to be disastrous:

GNU Emacs 27.2 
 Manjaro Linux 21.2.5 (codename: Qonos)
 Doom core v3.0.0-dev
 Doom modules v22.03.0-dev
 Ivy Version: 0.13.4
  
Issue*: 
 Some manpages do not show up when I run M-x man. Apparently, this only happens with non-default packages which I installed manual with pacman, probably with whatever I install from the aur as well, but I didn't test it. 
 For example, on the command line,$ man yt-dlp shows me the correct manpage, while on Emacs M-x man followed by yt-dlp does not list its corresponding manpage. 
 $ whereis yt-dlp show that yt-dlp manpage is at the correct location: yt-dlp: /usr/bin/yt-dlp /usr/share/man/man1/yt-dlp.1.gz. 
 The issue occurs with ivy-mode disabled as well.
 Posting here first instead of /r/doom because I figure this might be a system vs Emacs thing, and not a Doom thing...

It only started happening yesterday but it will pinwheel for a good 30-60 seconds and no other application does this. The file isn't particularly large, it's around 750 lines.... my project only has two branches and like 10 files, but all the editing is happening in just one of them. It's pretty annoying since I'm in the habit of saving frequently.
 I am just an ignorant student trying to get my assignment done, so go easy on me :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I use Emacs to write documentation, and a lot of times my files end up with some internal markup that looks like this: [TK: Where is the event handler defined?] in-line with the text. ("TK" is writer speak for "to come"), since the only common English words that have 'tk' in them are "pocketknife" and "hotkey", and case sensitivity matters.)
 I added "TK" to hl-todo-keyword-faces, but I discovered that hl-todo uses a regexp like (^|\s)(<keyword>), so the opening bracket confuses hl-todo and it doesn't show up in the todo lists.
 I wrote a quick perl script to place a space before the bracket, and it worked, and now the magit-status buffer says my documentation folder has 59 TODOs over 41 markdown files-- which is great!-- but it won't list them! Which is not great.
 So:
  
Remembering to include the space in [ TK: ...] is a pain in the neck, and looks terrible. Is there a way to modify the regexp such that the opening bracket is a legal character to hl-todo without hacking hl-todo's source in the elpa folder?
 
Has anyone seen this where Magit-todo won't list the TODOs? What do I do? I'm not the world's greatest elisp hacker, and it's always good to task first before trying to figure out for myself.
 
 Thanks it advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm trying to accomplish some SVG drawing with Haskell. Any language, really, but my go to is Haskell. I'm not really opposed to another language if anyone has a really great library in another language but that's perhaps off topic. I'm having trouble finding a library that really does everything I want.
 What I'm trying to do is draw a series of SVGs that are all varied but similar in many ways. So code sharing is important, which is why I can't do this in SVG and I need a programming language to generate them. I need to load in SVGs that I'm using from other sources as icons and also fonts and things like that.
 This is what I've looked into and found.
 svg-tree seems to be the library with the ability to read in SVG files and parse them into internal docs to manipulate.
 lucid-svg, which is recommended by svg-tree for doing actual drawing, doesn't seem to have this, but is much better for providing a drawing API, which I'll be using a lot of.
 svg-builder is very similar to lucid-svg, same up sides, a bit of an annoying use of hard to read operators for the attributes instead of just using tuples and lists, in my opinion, but fine, no reader still though.
 blaze-svg seems to not have any parser either, have much less documentation, and have a less nice API for drawing.
 I don't think the svg-tree data types are compatible with lucid-svg, but that'd be nice if they were based on each other.
 Does anyone know of a good setup for what I'm trying to do?

 At the very least I would like to be able to "background" the spawned process (&), so I can continue using Emacs. Even better would be to also "disown" the process. (I don't know to do this at the moment with "! vlc &" either)

 here is a example in video
 I tried C-x SPC but selectio nis a bit lilmited from where I start and to add text to EOL, string-regex is like too restrictive or complicated just to add some text with return etc...

 private Properties properties = new Properties(); public String getProp(String propName) { try { String systemProps = System.getProperty("user.dir"); properties.load(new FileInputStream( systemProps + "\\target\\config\\application.properties")); return (String) properties.get("cluster.min-size"); } catch (IOException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } return properties; } 
 but I want to do it with scala-java interaction.

 Dear all,
 There were several people who came to the last meetup looking for information about debugging Org mode. The last meetup was rather unhelpful in this regard since we dove into a specific use-case.
 I plan to try once more providing a more general introduction to Org (and Emacs) debugging. Tentatively, I plan to talk about: 1. Running Emacs with clean configuration + latest version of Org 2. Bisecting config to find configuration-related issues 3. Using Emacs profiler and sharing profiler results 4. Answer any questions on the first three topics
 After the introduction, we can continue with interactive debugging if there is anyone experiencing performance (or other) issues with Org and willing to share screen.
 Note that using microphone and/or camera should not be required. Jitsi does have chat.
 The time will be the same: 9pm SG time (4pm Moscow; 8am New York; 1pm London). Sat, Mar 26
 I will post the link to the meeting one hour before the meeting start.

 Is this behaviour familiar to anyone?
 I managed to fix the navigation problem by getting rid of evil-respect-visual-line-mode and instead doing the following (source):
 (define-key evil-motion-state-map [remap evil-next-line] #'evil-next-visual-line) 
 (define-key evil-motion-state-map [remap evil-previous-line] #'evil-previous-visual-line)
 But this only works on navigation, not on yanking, deleting, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an emacsian newbie and also with ADHD, I have many tasks which remind me to do daily/weekly/etc. things, jog my memory (poor man's Anki), etc. And I sometimes treat or think about my repeated tasks differently than my one-off tasks. In order to differentiate them in Agenda, I have adopted a policy of appending their repetition amount in the headline itself, like this:
 *** TODO Clean/Organize Garage for 10 minutes .+1w SCHEDULED: <2022-03-19 Sat .+1w> Spend at least 10 minutes cleaning up the garage. (I'll probably do more, but 10 min minimum.) 
 This makes it clear to me that this is a repeated task. So for example, if the above case is overdue by 3 days, I might just CANCEL the task to get it out of my hair, and let it roll forward to next Sat. But I wouldn't want to CANCEL a one-off task. I'll let it sit in my Agenda or reschedule it. 
 Do you do something similar? Or is there a more emacsian way to do this? I do use org habits for some things, and they are obviously not an issue because they are clearly differentiated from one-off tasks. I like my system, but it's sort of an anti-pattern since it's not automated or checked. So I'd like to know how others deal with this kind of differentiation and interaction with Agenda.

 Hey Emacsers,
 How are you doing?
 This post is "pretty" special to me because I can still remember and feel:
  
the first time I discovered Org Speed Keys and,
 the first time I took a look at its implementation.
  
It was two AHA moments, one in my Emacs journey and the other in my Elisp journey.
 I hope you'll enjoy it :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Quarto website
 Quarto® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc
  
Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.
 Author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks.
 Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
 Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.
  
See Quatro gallery to have a quick look at its potential.
 Don't get me wrong, I'm convinced that org-mode is more powerful and features rich, but the integration made here with Quarto is to me a good example of a powerful and sleek integration of Pandoc and its ecosystem. 
 I still have this feeling that org-mode suffers from a visibility issue, most likely associated with the fact that it's only pegged to Emacs (although serious cloning attempts exist: orgmode.nvim or neorg/).
 I find the orgdown initiative very interesting in the sense of opening up org to something other than our beloved Emacs.
 What do you think ? Can we dream of access to org-mode as simple and complete as Quarto for example while benefiting from the same "universality"/popularity of the markdown format, is this vision realistic, attainable ?
 Have fun.

 I haven't seen this example but is it possible to pass a Haskell function to C with the type
 myfunc :: [CDouble] -> [CDouble] ?
 I suspect that directly passing a function on lists is not possible. What about functions on storable vectors?
 myfunc :: SV.Vector Double -> SV.Vector Double ?
 From what I've seen, transforming Haskell functions for C is handled by a "wrapper" function, I'm not sure what the limits of this conversion are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been writing a simple GUI app using reactive-banana, and I've run into a problem. The GUI displays one of two meshes: mesh A or mesh B; the user can switch between them by clicking a checkbox. My event network looks like this:
 ---checkbox---+ | -------A------+---AorB---+ | | -------B------+ +---mesh--- | --------drawParams-------+ 
 The problem is that every time I click the checkbox, the mesh now being visualized (either A or B) is regenerated, which takes quite a while. The event network doesn't trigger it -- changes A shows no activity -- but a trace in the (pure) generation function shows that the mesh being activated is being regenerated.
 (It used to be worse; before switching with switchB, I was generating AorB with, essentially, liftA3 ifThenElse, which made both of the meshes regenerate every time the checkbox was clicked!)
 I note, however, that merely changing the draw parameters does not result in a rebuilding of the mesh; apparently the value of AorB is cached in some way. Is there a way in reactive-banana to request this behaviour; that is, to tell it to cache the value of some Behavior so it doesn't have to recompute it when using it further down the network? Failing that, is there some simple way to do the caching myself? (I can just about see how to do it using IORefs and something like imposeChanges, but a simpler way would be better.)

I am going to take a compilers class in a week where they use Haskell to build the compiler. I have some exposure to Haskell before in a prior class but I have forgot most of the stuff. Haskall programming from first principles is too long and verbose and I fall asleep reading it as it seems to be a lot of explanations compared to exercises. I want to get ramped up quick, reviewing some of the material I forgot but also be prepared literally next Monday when the compilers class start. I am looking into reading the lecture notes and doing the exercises from this https://www.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ecis194/spring13/
 as recommended by another post https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3onkc5…

 then reading yet another monad tutorial and call it a day. Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mario Bunge (1919–2020) was an Argentine-Canadian philosopher and physicist. Here are some excerpts from his book Between Two Worlds: Memoirs of a Philosopher-Scientist (Springer-Verlag, 2016) about his use of card-boxes and about the alleged exploits of a card-pilferer. One guesses from these glimpses that Bunge's card-system was not as developed as Luhmann's, which is no discredit to Bunge's achievements.
Around 1956:
"My next task was to prepare my course. Since none of the textbooks known to me was satisfactory, I resorted to the maieutic method that Plato had attributed to Socrates. My lectures consisted essentially in questions that I distributed beforehand to the students, and an abstract of the research that they had prompted. I wrote each question on a 6 × 8 card.

 Is there such a thing for emacs? Notice this is not a "minimap". Although that would be awesome! I dream of the day where sublimity mini-map moves from experimental.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am trying to wrap my head around the Profunctor typeclasses.
 Notably, I am trying to find out why there isn't a lot of code around using something like Monoidal/ProductProfuctor and instead there seems to have been a decision to go for Traversing and similar typeclasses.
 I have been looking mostly at this discussion from a couple of years ago that has the following:
  
davemenendez says that you can implement wander using the Monoidal typeclass (which, as far as I can tell, is only true if your profunctor is representable?)
 ekmett says that Monoidal is implemented via Traversing in the profunctors lib (which doesn't make sense to me, because I don't see how one can write one in terms of the other)
  
There's the glassery blog post from Oleg that also mentions Monoidal, but with disappointment because it doesn't bring much on top of Choice, if I understand correctly (but I don't see e.g. Costar mentioned in the table where this conclusion is reached).
 I have spent a couple of hours trying to implement Monoidal in terms of Traversing and vice-versa and gone nowhere unless I also bring Representable to the table, but there are some good examples for non-representable instances of Monoidal so I don't want to do this.
 Either I am missing some cool trick in my bag of tricks or I really don't understand what's happening here.
 Anyone got some illuminating text or notes or something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been seeing strange behavior with my Emacs lately, such that it creates a link to a file that has unsaved changes. I have an example shown here. I do have backups disabled using the below lines in my dotfiles:
 (setq backup-inhibited t) (setq auto-save-default nil) 
 However, these only stop the backup files that start with a ~, the kind that I'm seeing now, I haven't been able to find references for it on the web. Any pointers are highly appreciated.

 Awesome. I just tried out gdb and was disappointed with the lackluster information.
 I'm still on 28.0.50, I guess I'll have to upgrade to another WIP version :-).

 I have recently learned Haskell and have written some code but I feel like I am just writing pure functions in a procedural and I am not taking advantage of the abstractions offered by Haskell. It is not that I don't know about these abstractions it is because I don't think about them when I am writing code so my question is do you have any suggestions on how to actually write code that takes complete advantage of Haskell's awesomeness? Feel free to point me to any book/articles/videos that talk about this subject. Thanks!
 PS: In order to learn Haskell I have read Learn you a Haskell for great good and Haskell from first principles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a new package but I need help because I don't really know how to "link" a function to an object. Here is the current structure of my code:
 (defmacro print-first (first) "Print FIRST name." `(message ,first)) (defmacro print-full (first last) "Print FIRST and LAST name." `(message ,(concat first " " last))) (defun make-pet (first-name last-name) "Create a pet using FIRST-NAME and LAST-NAME." (make-record 'pet 1 `(first-name last-name (print-first first-name) (print-full first-name last-name)))) 
 Basically I want a user to be able to define a pet, and my library should be able to generate functions for that pet. In my actual library, some of these functions modify the properties of the pet itself not shown here. Is what I have shown here the best way to do this? Should I be using make-record?
 Also, are there any tips for testing macros? I am reading about how when they are compiled and ran that they behave differently than when evaluated and ran.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From: https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#precursor
  
The Precursor is the latest open source hardware project from OSHW wizard Andrew "bunnie" Huang – AKA "the guy who broke the Xbox DRM and is now suing to overturn the DMCA."
 https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5921
 It's a mobile hardware platform, "a framework upon which you can assemble a wide variety of DIY mobile applications…designed from the ground-up to be carried around in your pocket."
 "It’s not just a naked circuit board with connectors hanging off at random locations: it comes fully integrated—with a rechargeable battery, a display, and a keyboard—in a sleek, 7.2 mm (quarter-inch) aluminum case."
 The design is derived from the Betrusted project, an ambitious open source hardware privacyphone initiative that is super cool, but still has a long way to go before it's ready for field use.
  
 After digging through the docs, it looks like it uses a Rust-based OS called Xous 
 https://xobs.io/announcing-xous-the-betrusted-operating-system/
 Given that this is a BW graphics device with a hardware keyboard, long battery life, wifi, and fits into your pocket -- this might be the ideal mobile emacs device.
  
I'm not sure if Emacs will compile on it, and there's no X11 or Wayland to speak of, so there will be some roadbumps.

I have seen that I get different date-time formats and also different editing behavior. This probably has a good name (or keyword) that I could google but I don't know what what would be.
 First, date-time format can come in (at least) two different "flavors" and I don't know what the difference is.
 First one is with [] used as block characters
 CLOCK: [2022-03-21 Mon 11:51]--[2022-03-21 Mon 12:36] => 0:45 
 Second is the same but with <> used as block characters
 CLOCK: <2022-03-21 Mon 11:51>--<2022-03-21 Mon 12:36> => 0:45 
 I can change between these two different style by putting my cursor on the brackets (either type) and then use S-UP/DOWN to change between them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering trying non-doom emacs and wanted to see if my rationale makes sense. I really appreciate the work hilsner did making doom btw, I use it constantly
 I mainly use emacs for org mode and some light coding. I do use vim bindings. I'm on a mac
 With Doom I feel like there is a lot of extra stuff that I don't need or understand. I like the idea of building something from scratch that is leaner and fits my needs. Also, if I have a question, it's hard to know if it's a doom thing or an emacs thing. I would just learn emacs
 Does that make sense high level? Would it be a crazy amount of work to configure it to what I use emacs for now? I'm willing to do some work to get to a good place, but don't want to be stuck fiddling with it forever either. Is there somewhere that would be good to start from?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I have been working on a simple threading / pipeline library for emacs largely based off a cl library with the same name. For those who don't know what that means its basically a way to make deeply nested code into something much easier to read. It can be thought of as analogous to a unix pipe.
 (some (code (that (is (deeply (nested)))))) ;; turns into (arr-> (nested) (deeply) (is) (that) (code) (some)) 
 where the result of the last result is passed in as the first argument of the next.
 There are other variants for different use cases, whether you need to pass it in as the last argument or even if you need arbitrary placements, all can currently be achieved. This is not the end though as there are plans to aggregate a bunch of arrows from different languages, not because its necessarily practical but because its fun!
 here is the github page for it, if people want to use it, if its useful to people ill also post it to (m)elpa
 Feedback and PR's are as always appreciated.

2022 Week 12
Last Week
Onboarding and refactoring "Paul, Annie Murphy. The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2021." My experience working in my ZK with the notes from reading Annie Paul's book was basso-profundo. The ideas resonated, and it was easy to rewrite the highlights with my understanding and find relevant links to what was already in my ZK.
Reading "Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson."
This Week
More reading and onboarding "Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson."
I'm most excited about the development of a proximity search tool! While refactoring and deep linking "The Extended Mind," the near_search.py proved itself. It quickly surfaced surprisingly relevant link candidates that would have taken lots of time and frustration to find.
I want to start on a short video presentation on using citations with The Archive integrating Zotero and Pandoc for perfect Markdown to PDF or Word documents. You can easily cite using any style (CMOS, MLA, APA, IEEE, or whatever) and have the final document outputted in any format you need.

Note identifiers are avoided altogether in favor of descriptive filenames. This obviates the timestamp versus Folgezettel question. A tradeoff is that note filenames should be unique and should be considered immutable: a title cannot be changed without changing each reference to the note with that title. This seems like a minor inconvenience, in view of the use of backlinks to create indexes and hubs, below.


Bibliographic entries (literature notes) are separate notes that link to a note titled Bibliography.  The choice of writing bibliographic entries within Obsidian (the slip box component of the Zettelkasten) seems less efficient than working with a reference manager such…]]></summary>

 How can I configure TCP keep alive parameters per-socket, specifically TCP_KEEPCNT, TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL? This is based on this doc for context.
 network library exposes SO_KEEPALIVE parameter that as I understand enables/disables it, but not the three parameters above? Even with that parameter, when I print its value after setting it to 1 in the client I get 64 and in the server I get 8 – so I am not sure if I am setting it correctly...
 There is also keep-alive library that seems to allow configuring TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL per socket, but it doesn't compile on Mac.
 I would really appreciate any suggestions here - thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently writing an article in org-mode and use org-cite for my citation needs. I export via LaTeX and have everything working as expected, using biblatex-apa in the background.
 Following APA guidelines, I need to produce a few citations with a prefix that ends in a semicolon, e.g., "... (here is the prefix; Author, 2022)." Unfortunately I can't get this to work since the semicolon is used as a delimiter of citations in org-cite (cf. here). Thus I can produce "... (here is the prefix, Author, 2022)" with [cite:here is the prefix, @author2022], but [cite:here is the prefix; @author2022] doesn't work.
 As a workaround, I could use LaTeX code (e.g., \autocite[here is the prefix;][]{author2022}) which yields the correct result when used in LaTeX directly. The problem is that the prefixes are mostly acronyms, which I like to put in small capitals, and exporting \autocite[\textsc{abc};][]{author2022} to LaTeX for somehow doesn't work (it gets converted to \autocite[\textsc{abc};][]\{author2022\}).
 How can I produce the citation with a prefix that ends in a semicolon? This should be simple, but I can't find a solution and it is driving me mad. Any help is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm a mentor for FIRST Robotics Competition. I want to transition my team of novice high-school students from Java.
 EDIT: I shouldn't have assumed that people would just be familiar with FIRST... I've had a few questions asking exactly what I my use case is. Essentially, students are given 8 weeks to build a robot for a competition. We aren't told the rules in advance, so everyone has the same 8 week period to design, build, and program the robot.
 However, off-season teams tend to do things like write general purpose code (e.g., movement) or streamline processes, make practice robots, etc.
 The library used in the competition (optional; teams can also create low level code from scratch, but almost nobody does) is called WPILIB. It's primarily a Java and C++ framework, which you can read about here.
 I recently became an F# evangelist and found that functional programming has greatly reduced the fragility of my code by way of ensuring a correct data model.
 I am looking to move our team to possibly using Spring and definitely using Scala or Kotlin.
 One of my fellow mentors has suggested that object oriented design is easier to reason with in the case of a robot, and suggested Kotlin as our next language.
 I suggested that functional programming can definitely be used to model a Robotics systems and ensure that invalid states are explicitly rejected while making the program easier to debug and test.
 Regardless of which language we pick, everyone will be learning it (and Spring) from scratch. 
 What are your thoughts? Which language will better suit what we're trying to do?
 EDIT 2: We have decided on Kotlin for the main application code for now, but if Scala makes more sense for certain use cases (e.g., programming autonomous mode functions) we will be open to writing those modules in Scala. I still welcome any discussions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that this might come across as rude, and I apologise in advance if it does, but is anyone able to give me some rationale for why the Yesod forms API is the way it is? It seems to me to be incredibly overcomplicated. There's a mess of boilerplate, what with creating a data type and generating a widget from it, even if you need all of two fields, as in the case of a login form. In particular, controlling the layout and appearance of the form seems to be extremely cumbersome. The applicative API seems basically useless, given that you don't have any control over appearance - as soon as you want to do something as simple as tweak the label font size you have to drop to the monadic API.
 I'm coming from Flask here, so my reference point that you just write your form in a jinja2 template, in which you have full and straightforward control over the form's layout and appearance, then you access the form data from a request like so:
 ``` @app.route("/login", methods=("GET", "POST")) def login(): """Log in a registered user by adding the user id to the session.""" if request.method == "POST": username = request.form["username"] password = request.form["password"]
  # do things with username and password 
 ```
 Why not have something similar in Yesod, simply write the form as a Hamlet widget, and access the form data by name, instead of all this stuff with creating a datatype and generating the widget from it using generateFormPost and runFormPost? I'm new to Yesod, so I understand I'm probably missing a lot of information. But I don't think I require much expertise to state that I'm finding the API pretty unpleasant to use.

 The issue is this: when I run git commit it launches a new frame in my terminal, as you'd expect. The issue arises if I choose to cancel my commit using C-c C-k. Canceling the commit returns me to my terminal hanging on the git message "Hint: waiting for your editor to close the file...". It hangs until I take some other action on my system (taking an action such as spawning a new terminal, opening a new emacsclient, etc).
 If you have any ideas on what may be causing this, or I how I can provide more information, please let me know.

 ODE's solved in this way start with an initial condition and are solved by advancing by a time-step (if time is the relevant parameter) based on the current state. This is nicely solved using the iterate function. 
 I was initially planning on switching to a vector type or similar, but maybe that is not necessary?
 Any thoughts on if it's worth trying different container types?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of shifting my mail clients to Emacs, and have mostly configured the full setup (mbsync+mu4e). Initially, running mbsync -aV would just download all emails from the remote. While this wasn't a problem for my work email (a relatively new mailbox), I suspect this would be of a greater issue for my personal gmail as I have thousands of useless/spam/marketing emails which just eats up space. Given the download rate limit from gmail (2.5GB per day) and my limited local drive space, I was wondering if there is any setup in mbsync to only download N number of recent emails, or download emails after a specific year. (I could, alternatively, just cleanup my gmail inbox. Maybe that will be the last option!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can easily find good and extensive resources about about everything: functional programming, design patterns, libraries/frameworks, whatever it is.
 However, I can't seem to find anything that goes beyond the introductory level when it comes to concurrency stuff.
 I want to understand how threads work, what exactly a ExecutionContext does, what the heck is a Semaphore and a IORef?
 Is there anything that teaches me, from the very beginning, threads? Perhaps not why they exist (I know that), but what are their consequences, and how do we go about alleviating those consequences?
 The only extensive resource I could find is the book "Java Threads", which seems to be outdated, but I could be wrong.
 How did you learn all that stuff? Thanks.

 They don't have a Show instance.
 Now, I expect you'll say "But /u/NNOTM", just add a standalone deriving instance!"
 I thought the same. However, it's such a complex graph of dependencies involving type families and similar that I gave up after 20 minutes of trying to add deriving instances for some types and finding workarounds for others where that's not possible.
 There's also the excellent recover-rtti library and its anythingToString function, but I couldn't use it here since it wasn't compatible with the version of GHC I was using.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My build process has become somewhat stable. After each run the scripts upload everything (binaries produced and scripts used) here:
 https://corwin.bru.st/emacs-28
 In addition to what gets posted to the alpha FTP site, the scripts make and upload "NATIVE_FULL_AOT" versions (from the emacs-28 and master branches, currently).
 If you aren't familiar, passing NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1 to make triggers full ahead-of-time native elisp compilation. In the case of Windows builds, this means the build will include DLLs for most/all elisp sources distributed with Emacs. These DLLs can be used without additional pre-requisites apart from what is included in emacs-<version>.zip (or emacs-<version>-installer.exe). This is useful when you can't --don't want-- to put GCC/libgccjit on a Windows system where you use Emacs.
 Thanks much for all of the help testing out the builds I've been making and in advance for your feedback on the AOT versions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Haskell all the Comonads (at least the ones defined in the comonads package) are duals of transformers Monad Transformers. This is taken by changing the occurrence of the “state parameter” from positive to negative occurrence ((,) s <-> (->) s). 
 For example (in pseudocode)
 —- m is Monad, w is Comonad —- Writer and Co-writer WriterT s m a ~ m ((,) s a) TracedT s w a ~ w ((->) s a) —- Reader and Co-reader ReaderT s m a ~ (->) s (m a) EnvT s w a ~ (,) s (w a) —- State and Co-State StateT s m a ~ (->) s (m ((,) s a)) StoreT s w a ~ (,) s (w ((->) s a)) 
 However this is also a pretty restricted notion of duality. I wanted to know if there is a more intuition as to why this is the case, and then to what the dual of something like MaybeT, SelectT, and ContT (or is there?). Or why (->) and (,) are duals (because one is the exponential, and the other is the product); why aren’t the duals Either and (,)?
 MaybeT m a ~ m (Maybe a) ~ m (1 + a) CoMaybeT w a ~ w (Void, a) ~ w (0 * a) —- Note that CoMaybeT is uninhabited when w is a Comonad

 I have the following error.
 ```
 there were 2 deprecation warning(s); re-run with -deprecation for details
 ```
 I search "re-run with -deprecation for details scala" on internet. nothing comes up. 
 ​
 I have no clue how to figure out where the error come from. 
 I can't seem to find anything related to scala by searching google. 
 For example, converting number base like from base 2 to base 10.
 ​
 I am reading a book on scala right now, so if I have encounter the material in the book before, I may be lucky and find answer there.
 ​
 I also search scala api document.

 How can I search for error related to scala language? 
 I can't seem to find anything by searching google, search from books, search scala api.

  <#/part><#/multipart> -------------------- End of forwarded message -------------------- 
 It it unclear to me where I should include my message to the forwarded email. I tried adding it before and after this text, but my text does not actually show up on all email clients of my recipients (for example Gmail).
 This style of forwarding is different from what I am used. I came from mu4e and other email clients where an email is usually quoted (as it would have been for a reply) and then I usually top-post my additional message.
 How do I correctly forward a message in notmuch? Is there a way to have a more "traditional" forwarding format which uses the same format as when replying (with a different message subject)?

 It seems that this is a mode is "global" and there is no way to restrict this mode to python buffers only. I don't understand the details but somebody explained it here on emacs.stackexchange.
 So the question is if there is another package or solution to have something like this (prefered in the headline) but in Python buffers only.
 I read about some lsp-mode depended solutions. The problem here is that I use eglot instead of lsp-mode and won't change that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently swapped from Ivy and Flyspell to Vertico and Spell-fu. Now, whenever I try to correct the spelling of a word with ispell-word, instead of having the possible choices appear through Vertico, they appear in a pop up window at the top of the screen, and I can press a number to select the desired word. 
 I think it should be possible to integrate the spelling completions into Vertico - I know that Doom Emacs does this. Does anyone know how to set this up correctly? I was recommended the "spell-correct" package, but I can't find it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In short - Decades with Emacs but have only used org for recording notes, snippets, ideas.. never for tasks. Okay writing elisp just always used a simple checklists in whatever pocketable devices I had at the time. Random youtubes or org-mode pages tends to show simple agenda view but what I _think_ I'm looking for is more complex and I'm not sure org-agenda/etc can do it as is? (Presumably there are org query APIs I could hijack and make my own major mode viewer, but trying to reduce TODOs not add more ;)
 With hundreds of to-dos, perhaps org-mode/agenda/whatever can save me? The rate of adding to-dos exceeds the rate of completing them sadly :)
 Ideally plainorg or beorg can render it as well.
 Current Workflow:
 - many are dated to-do's - the date by which I'd like to see them
 - many are undated, but tagged (home, work, cycling, etc etc) and/or prioritized (high, medium, someday, etc)
 What I'd like to see is a single view including (in order):
 (by default, ignore tags; but be nice if the below could also be filtered down to 1 or more tags as well)
 - dated yet unfinished tasks for today
 - tasks that are pass due (dated for yesterday or earlier, and not checked off)
 - tasks that are undated, sorted by priority (descending)
 I don't want to have to cycle views for this, which is the trick; every to-do system in the planet can let you show upcoming or late to-dos, or the ones by tag, or the undated ones. I want the combined single view, so can glance and go.
 Most to-do applications (such as Apple Reminders) let you create smart lists that you pick very specific criteria, without OR functionality; so date for tomorrow, but not date for tomorrow+undated; a specific priority, but no sort by priority after picking two priorities say, that sort of thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've started a new job writing lisp, and using emacs as the default environment. I'm still learning the editor (and the language), but the part I'm having the most trouble adapting to is C-z C-x C-c C-v commands that are standard with Windows. Given that I've used those commands since I've used computers in general, I don't think it's going to be easy to switch over.
 I've seen that there is a mode that sort of removes that possibility, CUA mode, but it seems like it would interfere with most of the slime commands. C-c and C-x seem to be very busy keys.
 And so I have thought of a solution that I think would work, and it's crackpot enough that I think trying it will be fun. I'm not completely sure it will work, and so am requesting community input.
 OK, so here's the plan. I'm going to de-mothball my custom keyboard which allows me to remap keys. Then I would remap the Caps-Lock key to one of the F13-F24 keys, and then using that as the Control for emacs sequences. C-c would be (Caps lock)-c and C-x would be (Caps lock)-x. I think that's possible to change in my init file? Emacs has proven to be a remarkable beast in its extensibility and I'm like 90% sure that this is doable.
 Anyway, I am wondering if there is some obvious problem with this plan, other than the glaringly obvious one which is that it's less trouble to just learn the shortcuts. (What's the fun in that, though?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been throwing together bits of elisp over the past few months and it's sort of turned into a tiny little major mode for Typescript (and Javascript) webapp files: https://github.com/orzechowskid/tsx-mode.el
 indentation and jit-lock syntax highlighting are powered by tree-sitter, and code analysis and completion are powered by lsp-mode. servers and grammars for both should be automatically installed and configured for you. tagged template strings for some common CSS-in-JS patterns are indented and support code-folding, and have CSS syntax highlighting and completion applied to them when point is inside of them.
 I've been using this at work and at home for a while now and am very pleased with it. but I'm positive there are hidden assumptions it makes and/or failures in handling use-cases which I personally don't have, so I'd love to get extra eyes on it to see where it can improve. comments (or PRs!) are very welcome.
 thanks for looking!

 Is there a solution, perhaps to just check a region instead of the whole buffer?

 They start with
 toListOf :: Traversal s s a a -> (s -> [a]) 
 where a Traversal s t a b s is a function
 forall f. Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> (s -> f t) 
 Then, they generalize Traversal s s a a to
 (a -> Const (Endo [a]) a) -> (s -> Const (Endo [a]) s)

What are factors to consider, when choosing EXWM vs. any other tiling WM? 
 Would you tell me which tiling WM you use and why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do use use-package but for a lot of packages there is not install and config instructions for it.
 This is my working configuration which I have some questions about.
  
The eglot start (via eglot-ensure) is configured in the (use-package python-mode block via a :hook. Python modes starts eglot. Is this a good solution? 
 company start is configured via a :hook in (use-package company block and starts when eglot comes up.
  
```emacslisp ; .... ; language server (replacement for lsp-mode) (use-package eglot)
 (use-package python-mode :ensure nil ; makes sure that Emacs in-build python-mode is used :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) ; connect to language server when py-file is opened :custom (python-shell-interpreter "python3") )
 (use-package company :after eglot ; this line alone does not help to start company :hook (eglot-managed-mode . company-mode) ; starts company when eglot is started )
 (use-package company-box :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))
 ; ..... ```
 I have some more examples; e.g. the ws-buttler. Do I start it that way?  (use-package ws-butler :init (progn (add-hock 'python-mode-hook 'ws-butler-mode))) 
 Or with a :hook where I do not know what I have to write there.  (use-package ws-butler :hook ?????? 
 Or should I use the python-mode?  (use-package python-mode :ensure nil ; makes sure that Emacs in-build python-mode is used :hook (python-mode . ws-butler-mode) 
 On important point is that e.g. ws-butler-mode should not only start when a Python buffer is opened. It should only work in that Python buffers and not in others after it is started.
 As a newbie it is very hard to decide which configuration ways I should use to start a mode. Should the mode install itself in via a hook to another mode (python)? Should the other mode (python) start it? etc etc

 data Counter a = Counter Integer a | Increment instance Functor Counter where fmap f (Counter count x) = Counter count (f x) fmap f Increment = Increment instance Applicative Counter where pure x = Counter 0 x (<*>) (Counter count1 f) (Counter count2 x) = Counter (count1 + count2) (f x) (<*>) Increment (Counter count x) = Counter (count + 1) x --Unsure if these two follow applicative laws tbh (<*>) (Counter count f) Increment = Increment (<*>) Increment Increment = Increment 
 ```
 My error:
 ```sh
 <interactive>:121:41: error: * Couldn't match type `a' with `b' Expected: Counter b Actual: Counter a `a' is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: (Prelude.<*>) :: forall a b. Counter (a -> b) -> Counter a -> Counter b at <interactive>:120:5-9 `b' is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: (Prelude.<*>) :: forall a b. Counter (a -> b) -> Counter a -> Counter b at <interactive>:120:5-9 * In the expression: Counter (count + 1) x In an equation for `Prelude.<*>': (Prelude.<*>) Increment (Counter count x) = Counter (count + 1) x In the instance declaration for `Applicative Counter' * Relevant bindings include x :: a (bound at <interactive>:121:36) (<*>) :: Counter (a -> b) -> Counter a -> Counter b (bound at <interactive>:120:5) 
 ``` Alright, so for my own personal education I'm trying to figure out how applicatives relate to effects outside of monads.
 My interpretation of an effect is something which changes the data structure, but is not affected by fmap
 The solution I came up with was to put the effect data as part of the "main" constructor, and the effect action as a union'd constructor. Thing is this type error is messing with me, and I'm not sure how to resolve it. First of all, is my interpretation of what an effect is wrong? Secondly, why is Counter a /= Counter b in this error message? They're both generic, so why is it having trouble with a = b?

I want a column that contains the directory paths to the buffers' files. I want this so I can display it with ibuffer-formats and filter on it in ibuffer-saved-filter-groups to keep track of files with the same name but for different projects.
 I've defined a couple of simple columns but can't figure out how to do this for path. I looked at the standard ones in ibuffer.el like filename but the code is a bit beyond my pay grade. I'd really appreciate any help or pointers for this. Some day I'll have time to become an emacs-lisp guru, but that time, unfortunately, is not now.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, learning FP and Haskell.
 I'm confused by the claim that FP is about programming the "what" and not the "how" (see 2nd paragraph in wiki). How could you possibly write a computer program without telling the computer what to do (the how)?
 The closest answer I've gathered is that FP is essentially about term rewriting systems (using beta reduction in particular). A rewriting step is analogous to a state transition step in turing machines. So then that means the compiler handles all the control flow for you, rather than FP somehow magically eliminating the need for control flow and other imperative ideas.
 Is this understanding correct? What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I do a lot personally is editing and running python project in remote servers, which almost always come with their own condo environments. I'm currently trying to do this in emacs with python-mode, lsp-mode and conda-mode. The command conda-activate works perfectly with lsp on my local machine, but when using tramp, it seems that the same command can only select environments from my local conda, no the remote one.
 Is there a way around this? Or is this unavoidable?
 Before getting into emacs, I used vim. Keeping a copy of vim in remote server was easy enough and access through ssh works nicely. If it's impossible to use conda environments on remote, is it possible to create some type of emacs client on remote and run something like graphic ssh?

 This python function is a simple recursive function with an if statement with multiple nested if statements within it. 
 The problem is when I converted this code to haskell I used guards and it's very much unreadable. Just to give as an example, this is one of my guards:
 | indexTxt < length txt && pat !! indexPat == txt !! indexTxt && (indexPat + 1) == length pat = findPat txt pat (indexTxt + 1) (calcPrefix pat 1 0 [] !! indexPat + 1) (mIndexes ++ [(indexTxt + 1) - (indexPat + 1)]) 
 It doesn't even fit on the screen as you can see.
 Is there any way to make my function more readable? I imagine I need to find some other way to makes this code more readable and preferably smaller, but I have no idea what my options are.
 Any help/tips/guidance would be appreciated.

 Then, I noticed that on the other device there is no elpa folder inside .emacs.d, I thought this makes sense as I don't use it anymore and disable it by putting (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) inside early-init.el. So I deleted the elpa folder, restarted emacs but now emacsclient -c tries to create a new frame but it gets crashed instantly without any error message. Restoring elpa folder solves the issue!
 There is no mention to elpa folder in my configs.
 How could I debug the issue?

 I don't think this is the right approach. Because It seems that changing "placeholder" for every hypothesis is extremely inefficient. There should be a better way.
 Can anyone suggest a way that I can think in "type language" way? 
 To give a more concrete example, consider the following scenario. 
 say you are using scala, you want to test a function for a case that only return int (maybe the function that you want to use only return int type.), but the function ultimattely accepts generic type. To test this function that return int in typed language, I have to always change signature to always fit my "testing hypothesis" that only care about int. I think you should get an idea now. because one need to change signature when testing certain hypothesis, I don't think it is a sufficient strategy. There must be a better way. Any idea? or debugging technique you use in this scenario.

 I've been an emacs user since around 1981. My .emacs still has some snippets from those days. I've used org-mode for literate multi-language programming and went through a phase some years ago where I used it for task tracking, but it was never quite satisfying. 
 I've been journaling and taking notes (personal and work) since the '90s, for about the last decade on OneNote. It's got excellent sync (win/mac/android/web), a word-processor-like UI, and fast, accurate search. But a few things finally made me switch away: totally vendor-locked-in data format (the big one), lack of easy tagging and links, and no proper source blocks - as a software dev, I felt that every day.
 So a few months ago I switched to logseq: it promises Markdown and/or org-mode …]]></summary>

 The "title" of the document and the "author" are shown correctly in the exported PDF, however the "date" shows up like this gibberish:
 Document Title Author Name ((timestamp (:type active :raw-value <2022-03-17 Thu> :year-start 2022 :month-start 3 :day-start 17 :hour-start nil :minute-start nil :year-end 2022 :month-end 3 :day-end 17 :hour-end nil :minute-end nil :begin 1 :end 17 :post-blank 0 :parent 0))) 
 In the org file, which I export, the date is specified correctly using the C-c ., like so:
 #+TITLE: Document Title #+AUTHOR: Author Name #+DATE: <2022-03-17 Thu> 
 I would like to have the date shown up as "March 17, 2022" in the exported PDF instead of that long ((timestamp .. string.

Most software adds datetime to the beginning of the file name. It looks tidy. But a series of numbers means a little to human. If I browse through the file names in a small window of a file manager, I can only see the digits without meaningful titles.
The advantages of placing datetime to the beginning of file names is tidy and sortable. I think.
Any thought from you is appreciated. Do you think it is a good idea to append the datetime after, what is the pros and cons?]]></summary>

 I'm from an autocracy country and due to strong opposition of the ideology and pessimism of its prospect in the future decades, I hope to immigrate to a western country to start over a new life.
 I have been working as a data engineer for about six years. And at present, I'm working for a foreign-invested company, using Scala as my working language writing Spark code, complicated UDFs, etc. However there seem not have a movement of people from global and my local company.
 My second language is English. In addition, I started a family in my native country and have two girls aged 4 and 1.
 I want to ask, if to become an immigrant to an English speaking country, what should be my next move? Should I apply for a Scala job remotely and then go abroad to work? Thank you so much.

to pass Haskell functions as callback to C functions. As the
implementation of libffi depends on the platform, we’ve had to port
it to WebAssembly.
This blog post introduces libffi, the challenges to make it
work with WebAssembly, demonstrates our implementation, and also
explains how it’s used by GHC runtime. I hope our implementation can

 I have the following workflow:
 I put all my papers in the folder /papers/some.pdf.
 To not loose track, I also create a todo in my /toread.org which links to file:./papers/some.pdf and some more notes.
 When I finally have time to read this paper, I copy the todo (from toread.org) using (org-copy-subtree) and then (org-yank) it in a newly created file /summaries/somepapernotes.org
 The problem is that the link to file:./papers/some.pdf won't work in /summaries/somepapernotes.org. It will point to /summaries/papers/some.pdf which doesn't exist. So I have to manually edit the link to file:../papers/some.pdf
 This manual step is annoying the deeper the hierarchy is. Is there a better way which adjusts the relative links automatically when I move subtrees up and down the hierarchy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone. I am learning about programming with monads. I discovered the following while traversing a data structure with a State monad, but it's easier to demonstrate with the IO monad. 
 If I use boolean operators, they will only evaluate the arguments that they need. e.g.: 
 Prelude> False && undefined False Prelude> True && undefined *** Exception: Prelude.undefined 
 So far, so good. This is what you'd expect. However, if I use the liftM group of functions to lift && to a monad, this no longer works. e.g.:
 falsify :: IO Bool falsify = putStrLn "It is a falsehood." >> return False verify :: IO Bool verify = putStrLn "Verily, it is so." >> return True liftedAnd :: Monad m => m Bool -> m Bool -> m Bool liftedAnd = liftM2 (&&) 
 Then, calling it in ghci:
 *Main> falsify `liftedAnd` verify It is a falsehood. Verily, it is so. False 
 So, you can't use liftedAnd for flow control. It's easy enough to write an AND function that behaves properly:
 mAnd :: Monad m => m Bool -> m Bool -> m Bool mAnd x y = x >>= \b -> if b then y else return False 
 Now, in ghci:
 *Main> falsify `mAnd` verify It is a falsehood. False 
 So, my questions are:
  
Would someone please explain why liftM2 behaves this way?
 Is there somewhere in the standard libraries to look for properly behaved && || if/then/else etc. for monads?
 Am I missing some key fact about liftM2? Perhaps I am not using it in the intended way.

What optimizations can I expect to still work? For example, if I unsafePerformIO a primop, does that not cause any issue given that there's nothing "inside" it to optimize? Or does it also block fusion from the outside?
 Any resources on this would be great, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years I began to learn Haskell using codeanywhere.com, which was a remote development environment that I was comfortable with for creating web services (I variously switch from Mac to Windows to Chromeos as my personal device). As I recall, I could follow the standard stack installation and do pretty much whatever I wanted without issue. After some interruption (life) I have returned to codeanywhere.com to restart my journey but I'm finding that the IDE has changed and I am unable to install or use GHCI without running into errors in the process. 
 I put in a support ticket and was told to use their Haskell vscode extensions in the IDE, but I'm completely lost and haven't found a simple tutorial to explain what I'm supposed to do or how to use them. 
 As an alternative, I can certainly install on a local machine or a VPS, but I feel like I'm missing something obvious with codeanywhere.com. Does anyone have experience working on this platform? What obvious thing am I missing here?

 im using Doom Emacs, already asked in the help section in discord, sadly no answer received :(

 But I don't want to have my home directory as a lsp-workspace-folder. I only want to have the specific project directories as workspace folders.Well, it still works fine when I delete the home directory via lsp-workspace-folders-removeand reopen the project directory and interactively select the directory. But after restarting emacs it just resets it to my home directory
 Does anyone have any idea what the reason is or how to fix this?Any ideas are appreciated.

This allows me to reliably find time bottlenecks in my code.
 The problem is that I have to manually factor out my code into all these separate {-# SCC #-} functions.
 Are there any plans to do what I suggested in the title? It would be cool if I could select lines of code and have them marked to automatically get factored out into a function of name e.g. func_{FILENAME:LINE}.
 Can anyone here add this? (How much would this cost?)

 My question is this just because of my laptop config or is emacsgcc compile real slow?
 By the way, I'm a noob with emacs so please be polite.
 And could mention some pros and cons of emacsgcc!

On my personal mac, it takes about 5-7 seconds to start up (which seems a bit long, but tolerable). On my work mac, on the other hand, startup is about 90s. This wasn't always the case. It initially ran the same on both computers, but one day it suddenly slowed down. I don't remember if I did anything to break it, but the config file is the same on both. 
 I ran the esup profiler and it tells that the total user startup time is 0.123 sec, which is obviously not true (or the the slowdown is not due to the config file). 
 Any idea on what might be going on or how to accurately profile the startup process?

 $ /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs 2022-03-15 21:34:51.135 Emacs-x86_64-10_14[6713:94719] It's not legal to call -layoutSubtreeIfNeeded on a view which is already being laid out. If you are implementing the view's -layout method, you can call -[super layout] instead. Break on void _NSDetectedLayoutRecursion(void) to debug. This will be logged only once. This may break in the future. 
 Of course, I can suppress these warnings by redirecting outputs to /dev/null, but I didn't get such warnings on Big Sur. Is there anyway to fix this warning instead of just redirecting the warnings to /dev/null?
 Thanks!

 Still, the question remains for me. Why do so many influential emacs users come from the Apple ecosystem? One theory I guess is that the advent of Apple computers and the popularity of emacs coincided. In addition, the similarity of the philosophical origin of these two products can be another reason. What is your opinion?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have switched from Company to Corfu but I am having difficulty getting the binding "C-k" to work as corfu previous. I use evil-mode so this would be a useful binding.
 My corfu setup is:
 (use-package corfu :straight t :defer t :diminish :bind (:map corfu-map ("TAB" . corfu-next) ([tab] . corfu-next) ("S-TAB" . corfu-previous) ([backtab] . corfu-previous) ("C-j" . corfu-next) ("C-k" . corfu-previous))) 
 "C-j" works completely fine, but "C-k" executes the action evil-insert-digraph (not entirely sure what that does...).
 Any suggestions are appreciated!

 I copied this diagram by Martin Grund from https://punchcard.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/emacs-movement-shortcuts-wallpaper/ with the aim of making a printable version. If you want to edit it yourself, I've got the original .drawio file in the gist too, but it only renders as text. You'd have to save it and open it with https://www.diagrams.net/ or the application you can download from there.
 I am still trying to figure out the best presentation of the printable version, so any general suggestions will be very much appreciated. The aim is to have something that will be visible and useful printed on a sheet of Letter or A4 paper, viewed from about 3 feet away. (in other words, the distance from my eyes to the patch of wall where I've got a copied pinned up!)

 Trying to do more with emacs, I wanted to integrate my conda environments into my workflow. I spotted the conda.el package, and tried to install it with use-package : elisp (use-package conda :ensure t :init (setq conda-anaconda-home (expand-file-name "~/miniconda3")) (setq conda-env-home-directory (expand-file-name "~/miniconda3")) :config (conda-env-initialize-interactive-shells) (conda-env-initialize-eshell))  This does not pose any issue when evaluated (and I've checked on github, people do it that way). My miniconda install is indeed in ~/miniconda3. However, when I try to execute M-x conda-env-activate, I get the following message : Symbol's value as variable is void : proper-dir
 Has anyone any idea how to fix this? Or is there another way to activate conda environments inside of emacs?

 I am able to compile org without generating the info files, but encounter difficulties getting EMACS to autoload org-mode from the `lisp/` directory correctly. 
 Any suggestions would be appreciated, or a better place to seek help. Thanks in advance.
 Org on people, org on.

 I use Linux at work but Windows on my personal laptop, which I still use for development. Yeah I know, everyone says developing on Windows sucks, but Git Bash fits decently well into my usual VS Code workflow, and until now I haven't run into any issues big enough to need to dual-boot or use WSL. But with setting up a dev environment for Scala 3, I tried setting it up through Coursier as recommended and ran into a bunch of problems/annoyances with the installed tools. (I then tried the same thing on my Linux work laptop and everything worked smoothly right off the bat.) Here's some of the issues:

 It seems to me that uuid is "the way to go" for creating IDs for linking since they are guaranteed unique, and will survive movement of a heading to another tree or file. Right?
 So I'm just starting to get into the whole linking-thingy in org mode, and it seems like I'll need to call org-id-get-create just about every time before org-store-link. Rather than make both calls each time, would it make sense to create a new function, my-org-id-get-create-and-store-link, so it simply calls both functions? Could someone help me with a function that will do both id creating and link storing?
 I do have the following set:
 (setq org-id-link-to-org-use-id t) 
 Such a function must have been done before a thousand times, right? Or am I missing something in terms of id creation and workflow?

 def mapFile(filePath:String): Map[String, Int] = { Source.fromFile(filePath).getLines().map { line => line.split(" ").map{ word=> (word,1) }.toMap.withDefaultValue(0) } } 
 Basically, 1st I try to iterate over the lines of the file, and then iterate over each word that is obtained when the line is splitted by spaces. The problem that this is returning me Iterator[scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int]], not Map[String, Int], so Im getting and error.
 Any idea how could I get the desired Map with all the words and 1 values?
 An example would be having the following file as input:
 hello this is a test bye 
 And the output should look like:
 Map("hello" -> 1, "this" -> 1 , "is" -> 1 , "a" -> 1 , "test" -> 1 , "bye" -> 1)

It's the opposite though: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.6.0.4/docs/src/Control.Monad.Trans.Maybe.html#MaybeT
 newtype MaybeT m a = MaybeT { runMaybeT :: m (Maybe a) } 
 I would have expected "Maybe (m a)" instead of "m (Maybe a)"
 All the others I checked are similar (StateT and ExcepT).
 Is there a hand wavy explanation for that ? I can see that monad and transformer laws apply, but I don't really understand why it's this way.

 Hope you're doing great. I'm using Emacs for about 15 years (So basically a rookies in scale of Emacs :P). Based on my experience over the years and specially in the recent times, not many people know about the wonderful world of Emacs and why it is such a fascinating tool. To me they are missing out a chance to enjoy Emacs. So, a while ago I've decided to create a video series and talk about Emacs Lisp in context of a long running project to create an "editor" with Emacs Lisp, In hope to help more people to enjoy the tool that changed the way I use computers and brought me joy over all these years.
 Yesterday, I recorded the 4th episode of the video series. I thought to myself that It might be a good idea to share it on this subreddit as well. I have a looooooong term plan for this series and looking forward to your feedback.

 I‘m immensely grateful for inline-java, and soon JVM‘s own FFI will improve over JNI, which is great in its own right. But do we have something for embedding C# code as well? Or some stable IPC to CLR or some other integrated way with little overhead that’s more robust than crude subprocessing or RPC?

 I've just updated to 27.1 on Ubuntu 21.10, and I'm encountering some weird behaviour with "M-.'
 Basically, it pops up a small "text bubble" where I can type a macro, which can get executed with enter. (See screenshot)
 I cannot figure out which commando is bound to M-. so I can disable it. Describe-key does not seem to work and overwriting it does not seem to help either
 My previous behavior was that M-. was bound to xref-find-definitions.

 Does anyone know what could be wrong here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For certain reasons I am switching from LSP-mode to Eglot. I am a Python developer who works a lot with conda environments. Sometimes I will open a python file before realising I am in the wrong conda environment. This means the LSP server (pyright) started with LSP-mode uses the wrong Python interpreter, not giving completions for libraries which are envionment-specific.
 For this reason, in LSP-mode, I had:
 (add-hook 'conda-postactivate-hook (lambda () (lsp-restart-workspace)))
 I cannot find the equivalent for Eglot. If I do:
 (add-hook 'conda-postactivate-hook (lambda () (eglot-reconnect)))
 Note I am using the conda.el package for conda environment switching.
 This does not work, instead I get the error "Error running timer: Process EGLOT (test/python-mode) not running"
 Is there a way for me to cleanly restart Eglot in the buffer as though I had changed environments before visiting the file? Note, if I change environments first and then open the file, Eglot is correctly started in the proper environment.
 Any help appreciated!

 I have been looking at the distage example (https://github.com/7mind/distage-example), and it looks very promising for writing effectful programs that work both with ZIO and cats-effect as the effect implementation. Although I do wonder if the same can be achieved by defining the APIs in terms of a trifunctor effect, instead of the bifunctor effect type showcased in the example.
 Would appreciate any input on this or links to further related materials.

 Basically, just write out a line and then a Latex export block. The first line can be used to control the font size, by setting scaled to be whatever you want, it is set to 1.5 in this case. I cant seem to change the font size of the export latex block. You can see in this picture below:

 The body text is gigantic but the latex export font is not affected. How do I change this font size globally? I have a lot of these Latex export in my real document, and would like to know how to do that. 
 Appreciate all the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, when I decide to remove a link, I also need to remove the local file it is pointing at. Would it be at all possible for me to remove both using a single command, say, org-remove-link-and-trash-linked-file? For a safety measure, I'd rather use move-file-to-trash than to actually delete the associated file. 
 I already have this function to trash the current file, which works on my system (Linux Manjaro):
 (defun my-move-to-trash () (interactive) (if (y-or-n-p "Trash this file?") (progn (setq this-buffer buffer-file-truename) (move-file-to-trash (buffer-file-name)) (kill-current-buffer) (message "%s was trashed" this-buffer))) nil)) 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a project that I'm working on for managing projects, I'm calling it projectwarrior (because it is built to integrate with taskwarrior). I want to add a project open command which would check org-roam for a node associated with this project and create one if it can't find one (The idea is that this node would contain the project's support material a la GTD). I had originally thought to use org-roam-protocol's roam-ref, but I think I don't understand how the file-ref which org-roam-protocol requires works.
 It seems intended mostly for citation purposes, which I think could work (maybe there'd be a way to get from emacs back to the projectwarrior project eventually?). But to do that, I think I'd need to write some sort of custom citation format. Unfortunately my Google-fu is failing me at the moment, as searching "new org-ref protocol", "custom org-roam-ref citation format" and several other related results hasn't brought up any results that pointed me in the right direction. So, here's the question(s):
  
Is there a way I can suppress the warnings from org-roam when I put a ref that is plaintext? This isn't actually my preferred solution, but I figure I'd start here.
 Is there a place I can find instructions on how to create a custom whatever-it-is that org-roam is expecting in the ref field?
 Is there another approach to opening (or creating if necessary) an org-roam node from the command line? Would something like emacsclient (open-this-node <node-uuid>) that might be simpler and easier to create?
  
Thank you in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working at a quite well known startup in my country as a Data Engineer for more than 2 years. Primarily I do Data Analysis, because of my academic Machine Learning background, which makes my role closer to Data Scientist. 
 However, I am interested to work on Distributed System, Databases, and Stream Processing- that is Distributed Data Systems in broad. I wrote a Microservice in Golang in my current workplace. But I do not think this experience is sufficient to get hired as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems.
 I guess, after talking to some other Data Engineers and going through job posts, a project that involves mocking data streams, data ingestion with Kafka, data processing with Flink, serving with ad-hoc Scala microservices, containerization with Docker, and deploying on a Kubernetes (MiniKube perhaps?) cluster might help. What else to add or remove?
 What may I do to learn and later get hired to work as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems?

 [Disclaimer] I just started learning Scala. So I hope this question is not too basic.
 I'm doing the Advent of Code 2021 challenges to get a feeling for the language. Day 2 is a task where we have to parse a file, where each line contains a command. Each command updates one of 2 variables. I've tried to implement this using a functional programming style. I convert the commands to (Int, Int) tuples, where each element is a delta introduced by the command. Then, I need to sum these tuples element-wise (like a vector sum). Doing this sum was not very nice, because Scala seems to disallow tuple destructuring in (anonymous) function parameter position. Am I missing something?
 Also, do you have suggestions how I could make my code more idiomatic? I would love to hear them!
 Thank you in advance!
  def problem1_tuples(input: Iterator[String]): Int = { // input is an iterator of lines val (position, depth) = input.map(s => ( applyRegex(s,forward_pattern), // returns update for first value in tuple or 0 applyRegex(s,down_pattern) - applyRegex(s,up_pattern) // update for second value )).fold((0,0))((a,b) => (a._1 + b._1, a._2 + b._2)) // this is *ugly* position * depth // the challenge asks for the product }

I want to explore solutions to problems I'm having with pandoc citations

how do I get numbered of references with spaces between references

This minimal org-file takes ~10 seconds to open with emacs -Q on a modern laptop with 8 cores and 16GB memory, after which there are further delays when scrolling.

 That can get very confusing esp if you have a few slash alternatives in one or more headlines. If I were given the choice between reserving the slash char for my human-readable org headlines vs. used in the completion tree syntax, I'd rather the completion tree syntax look more like this:
 Standard Tasks%Buy/Return%

 But if I have to live with it, I guess I could use the pipe char

 This time I wrote on Cape!
 I highly recommend using cape to those who use corfu. It provides many useful completion-at-point-functions as well as transformers such as cape-capf-buster and cape-capf-silent. My favorite is cape-company-to-capf which converts company backends to completion-at-point-functions! This was the killer feature for me.
 Though this post is less thorough and has less "developed" code than my previous two posts, I hope a few of you still find it useful :)
 Edit: Some of you may notice the website redesign. I hope it adds clarity.

 From the docs, I see it's possible to pass parameters, but I'm not sure if the same can be done for including a code block limited to certain line numbers. Couldn't find much online and stack exchange is down for maintenance right now too.
 If I'm explaining it badly I basically want to do like:
 #+name: test #+start_src :noweb yes Line1 Line2 Line3 Line4 #+end_src #+start_src <<test(line1-2)>> #+end_src 
 So I get:
 #+start_src Line1 Line2 #+end_src 
 I can live without it, but it'd be nice to not need to split up the code block when I'm doing cursed code additions.
 Also, I'm on my phone. Sorry if it looks horrible or the syntax is all wrong.

 Googling tells me that Solo is a singleton tuple, but it is not clear to me what is the usefulness of having a singleton tuple over just an unwrapped value, and if the singleton tuple is important why isn't there some behind-the-scene-syntactic-sugar-magic to use the usual brackets notation for tuples also for singleton tuples?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm looking into writing some new functionality for emacs and as part of it need to be able to dynamically highlight individual characters, I've looked into messing with font-lock-mode briefly but that seems to be more geared to syntax highlighting based on regex. 
 I also tried using put-overlay and am now trying the highlight.el package but the way I've written it so far doesn't actually work and I'm not sure why. Can anyone point me in a better direction if this ain't the way/tell me where I'm screwing up?
 first I define a face:
 (defface position-1-face '((t (:foreground "#FF0000" :weight bold))) "The face for the first increment out of from the cursor" :group 'increment-faces) 
 Then I apply it like this
 (when (<= plus (point-max)) (hlt-highlight-region plus plus 'position-1-face)) (when (>= neg (point-min)) (hlt-highlight-region neg neg 'position-1-face)) 
 Where plus and neg are values that are 10 characters from the current point in either direction. My eventual goal with this is to have characters like 10, 20 and 30 characters out from the cursor highlighted so I can jump around more easily without having to figure out distances. 
 I know the faces are getting applied from the output of describe-char but they do not seem to actually show up.
 Ideally I'd like to drop the dependence on highlight.el so if there is a better built in way then please do let me know

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, I'd like to program some stuff for my arduino via (doom) emacs, but there are a few things, that I need:
  
Syntax Highlighting
 Auto completion
 Support for Arduino and Teensy
  
What I have tried
  
https://github.com/arduino/arduino-language-server - It needs modification of lsp-mode though, as it doesn't support passing cli arguments ootb
 https://github.com/motform/arduino-cli-mode and https://github.com/yuutayamada/company-arduino/ - Together they seem somewhat fine, but as soon as the project has a few .c/.cpp files the .ino triggered arduino-cli-mode poofs.
  
What I want to avoid
 Installing an IDE, I want to stay with emacs as far as possible. I don't like chonky bloated IDEs
 Other options
 https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile - How with the above mentioned QOL though
 Note: I'm very unfamiliar with elisp, I can do very basic things via trial and error while copying other stuff from my config.
 Do you have any idea what could be done here? I have tried everything I could.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just an FYI for all windows users. I installed Gccemacs on my work computer last night, and the process was very simple.
  
Install Msys2
 In Msys2 terminal, install libgccjit. Add to $PATH if it's not already there.
 Download emacs 28 or 29 from GNU: https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/ and run it. I used 28.0.91 build.
  
The snapshot Emacs binaries are compiled with native comp. It just works.
 Thanks to the dedicated folks that create window binaries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry guys if I am being annoying, but I got another problem that I cannot figure out by myself.
 As stated previously I was following the old emacs from scratch series from system crafters youtube channel to customize my emacs and it throws of error along with the line loading file .../elpa/bind-key-number.number/bind-key.elc failed to provide feature 'bind-key'
 So, at first, I thought I may don't have the package but when I tried installing it I was failing. So I searched the web a bit and found this bind-key file from tumashu/elpa git repo. So I copied it and pasted it in my bind-key.elpa file. After evaluating the buffer if I re-evaluate my init buffer everything seems to work. But if I re-start emacs the error comes back again which again goes off after re-evaluating the said buffers. 
 Is there any permanent fix for this problem? What am I doing wrong?

 First I thought maybe I haven't installed the font so I installed it using pacman. It installed it in "/usr/share/fonts/TTF/FiraCode-Retina".
 Now how do I use this font in emacs?
 (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "?")
 What do I put in the position of ?. I have tried putting the font name. Font name along with its absolute path. And some other variations. But everytime it just says font not found!
 Thank you for your help.

 Ok, that was a stupid mistake on my part.
 I just used "Fira Code Retina" and it seems to work. Sorry for the trouble!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I am customizing a Nord theme. The problem is that the face for hl-line kinda looks too much like the face for when you try to select a text using evil visual mode (press V)/. If without evil mode, this same face can also be shown if you just drag select using mouse. This is what I meant on a Nord theme:
 ​
 Nothing selected, just hl-line highlighting current line
 ​
 You can barely see the word VISUAL under Visual mode in vim (pressing V)
 ​
 Again, here I drag and select the word VISUAL using the mouse. Hard to see
 To see things clearly, I use a different light theme:
 ​
 Normal with only hl-line face color
 ​
 Here you can see both the hl-line and the vim Visual/drag select very clearly.
 Question: What is that face name, he one you drag select/highlight using evil? I tried to do an M-x customize and type "evil" but I got are something like evil-ex-search
 Any input is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[imo FRP is so so good. Its paradigm feels extremely natural in a way beyond the complexity of its encoding would suggest. eg looking at the implementation of reflex a few times, it seems to basically implement an entire runtime system on top of haskell's runtime system.
 On one hand it's very cool that haskell is flexible enough to implement a runtime system as a library, but I wonder if there's gains to be made in something more wired in (eg in terms of optimization, simplifying compile times, simplifying types, etc.) - it always struck my as a bit hacky.
 I know elm used to have builtin FRP but dropped it (I don't recall exactly why - any insight here would help!)
 Perhaps a proper "dataflow" language - though my (poorly informed) impression is that these are all way more special purpose and I've been spoiled by the full power of haskell.
 What do you think?
 EDIT: Looking into it more now - I redescovered this explanation of why Elm dropped FRP. It's honestly pretty disappointing - I understand from a developer UX perspective this simplifies a lot of things, but I'm not a fan of the redux "smash-everything-into-one-type" pattern - and a big draw for FRP is having the control flow represent dependency locality rather than synchronizing everything on one monlithic state

 I have a type Contact defined as follows :
 type Contact = (Person, State)
 I have a function in which I want to take some information about a Person to create a new Contact (with State = Good), and add it to a list of contacts, which looks like this :
  addContact :: Person -> [Contact] -> [Contact] addContact p c = c ++ (p, Good) 
 Compiler is complaining with the following message : Couldn't match expected type [Contact] with actual type (Person, State)
 But given that I have defined that Contact is a tuple with (Person, State), how am I supposed to declare that it is indeed a Contact? I can't seem to be able to create an instance of it because it's not a data type, just a type.

I managed to successfully save it to file on every rerender and then show it from there in emacs using image-mode. Question is, can I do it more directly without filesystem? Send somehow image through stdio to emacs and render using image-mode? What would you recommend?

I am writing a book and would like some feedbacks and best practices from you, regarding the method and organization.
I use now The Archive app and Google Docs.
Here is my organization:
I have a master file (a structure note) containing the outline of the book, ie the different chapters. Each chapter is a link in the structure note.
In the structure note, I put also some misc notes, like research notes.
I put a special tag in the filename of the chapters (like @b1 for book number 1).
I can check the total number of words up to date with the shell command: wc -w *@b1*.md
The step I didn't like very much is that I need to edit and compile the chapters in another tool. I use Google docs for that. Each time I find a mistake in my content, I need to modify the content in Google Docs and in The Archive app (source of my content). Not very efficient.
Please comment my workflow and share your practices :-)
Thanks]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll actually ask the archiving question first, since it's simpler: Is there any way to break up the archive files by year, so that anything I archive this year goes to journal.org_archive2022 or similar? I'm concerned that archives may grow too big and wondered if this could be automatic or if it's just something I should do manually.
  
The second question is harder (for me). I'm trying to set up my capture templates such that every day is the date in ISO format plus the day of the week, so a capture would make a subheading under 2022-03-11 FRIDAY. 
 This is probably not going to be super hard, but the org manual is.... vague on how I would do it. The "hard" one is, I'd like to have another template that puts the subheading underneath not only the date but another subheading. So you'd wind up with:
 * 2022-03-11 FRIDAY ** Log *** Entered Subheading Text, Text [Entered at [TIMESTAMP]] 
 I have no idea how to even begin to do this, because I'm not sure of several things. 
 1) How to make emacs give the initial heading as an ISO date rather than a datetree
 2) How to make it double up on headings so I get Log
 3) How to make this all respect my extend-day-until setting, because I go to bed WAY after midnight
 I'm meandering here but I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction. Thank you in advance.

(and similarly a >>= (b >>= (c >>= d)) is equivalent to
  
do r1 <- a r2 <- b r1 r3 <- c r2 d r3 
 The bind operator makes a functions input be wrapped in the same thing as the output by unwrapping the value before each chained function.
 E.G.

 Is this the reverse? It unwraps rather than wraps the output. And it only works for IO types? I've got the impression that IO is special is this unique to the io type?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[org-mac-image-paste — Paste images and cropped PDF clips directly into org files.
 emacs-mac only
 I've been trying to switch to Org-mode for note-taking, coming from Evernote, Notes.app, etc. I love the organizational power and security of plain text, but one thing I could never understand: why can't I just directly paste image/PDF data into an org file?
 I use this literally all the time, accumulating graphs, formulae, small screenshots, images from papers, websites, manuscripts, etc. The other key feature I needed was that cropped PDF data remained exactly that: a PDF file on disk. This is because I may later use it in talks, white-papers, etc., where preserving the vector quality is crucial.
 So, after some time trying (and failing) to convince myself such functionality must already exist, I wrote up a small package. Note that it unfortunately works only with the excellent emacs-mac variant, which provides (some) information about image data on the clipboard. I'm hopeful similar more general functionality could come to emacs/org in the future.

 I have 1 year of experience as a research engineer and, I am studying scala to switch my career to a distributed system(DS) engineer within this year.
 Currently, I am following the scala course of Coursera, but many posts in this subreddit mention various scala frameworks. I want to know that it is necessary to cover famous frameworks like akka, ZIO, spark.
 I am not afraid to learn, but I just want to set priorities.
 Are there some frameworks or packages, which are commonly used in scala?
 (Like node of javascript Or NumPy, scikit-learn in Python. )
 Sometimes I check a job description of scala keyword on Linkedin, but many of them do not mention what they want to an applicant (They just say like "we prefer scala" or "we use scala")
 So I am wondering where I have to focus to be a distributed system engineer.
 I studied distributed systems in graduate school, so my goal is to implement some DS toy projects using scala.
 Could I ask for advice to be a DS engineer?
 Thank you for reading :)

 I'm looking to implement a JSON linter and would appreciate some library / architecture suggestions. Some examples of the kind issues i'm interested in detecting are:
  
The field "base_path", if it exists, cannot use Windows paths, must be POSIX
 The field "date_created" must be in ISO8601
 etc.
  
I'm capable of writing the linter rules (i.e. detect date formats, path formats etc.), what I need help with is the IO / initial parsing phase. I'm familiar with parser-combinators (attoparsec has been my goto previously) but never before had a use case that cares about where the parsing failed. I've also used aeson a couple of times for handling JSON.
 The defining requirement is that, once an issue has been identified, the linter must report the location of the error including line number(s) and column numbers (start and end). It can be assumed that the data is valid JSON and conforms to the expected schema (i.e. if we expect a "date_created" field, it'll be there. I'm interested in format/quality issues rather than validating structure / syntax.
 Otherwise, the only requirement is that it be quick / run in parallel - It must be able to run over thousands of files in a couple of minutes.
 My initial plan was to use something like pipes-aeson for IO (not used a streaming library before but seems straightforward enough) however it seems that aeson is based on attoparsec and the parse-error is just a plain string without source locations.
 So, finally, to some questions.
  
Anybody have recommendations for parsing JSON (quickly) while keeping track of the source-locations of each field / key / value / object etc.
 Can streaming libraries like pipes be used to process the loaded files in parallel? Pointers / articles etc. covering this would be much appreciated!

 You don’t have to have Elm or Haskell experience, but it will help :)
 You do need to have interest in functional programming, but you probably wouldn’t be in this subreddit if you didn’t, now would you?
 Our shared working hours are 10 AM to 3 PM Eastern, you do need to be available during those hours, though we're flexible if something comes up.
 $100,000-$120,000 but do not quote me on the compensation, that is from memory for our associate level, it could be less or more by $10,000.
 The job description is for a mid-level, we don't have an associate FP job description. But just the technologies and the level are different, everything else should be the same.

 Hello,
 I am learning Haskell as part of a comp-sci course at University and have come across a wierd error when I try to build a package using cabal. 
 When I run cabal install, the installation fails due to the package wai-logger-2.4.0 not being able to build due to the package cabal-doctest-1.0.9 being broken with the specific error: 
 "Could not find module Distributive.Extra.Doctest"
 How can I fix this error?
 I have tried the following: 1. Reinstall cabal-doctest 2. Reinstall distributive 3. Delete and reinstall all cabal packages after running cabal update 4. Reinstall ghc
 Thanks in advance.

 I'm currently creating a project which I wanted to try using opaleye for DB access in. I have an M1 Mac with 16GB of RAM and use ghc-8.10.7 by stack-2.7.5, both installed through ghcup.
 Soon after starting to build product-profunctors, I get an error
 -- While building package product-profunctors-0.11.0.3 (scroll up to its section to see the error) using: /Users/mateusz/.stack/setup-exe-cache/aarch64-osx/Cabal-simple_mPHDZzAJ_3.2.1.0_ghc-8.10.7 --builddir=.stack-work/dist/aarch64-osx/Cabal-3.2.1.0 build --ghc-options " -fdiagnostics-color=always" Process exited with code: ExitFailure (-9) (THIS MAY INDICATE OUT OF MEMORY) 
 When I rerun, I get the same result in a few secs. It must be very quick, as I don't see any visible spike in memory usage on monitor (it oscillates around 9-10GB). /usr/bin/time -l shows rss of 200MB, but I guess it's stack's usage, not ghc's.
 That's strange to me as I compile a 300+ deps project at my work in a similar amount of RAM without problems, and I have also compiled stack on my 4GB Raspberry Pi (which took a lot of time, but didn't outofmemory either). Is this package really that heavy, or there's something wrong with my installation?

 So I am trying to find an easy way of summarizing what I did do on a particular day or week.
 I am mostly using Todos/Tasks that I mostly complete through the Agenda view, but I also log smaller tasks, questions, stuff that showed up within the journal (C-c c j).
 What I am looking for is a way to just summarize all Todos that were closed and journal entries made on a particular day in one output.
 I looked a bit at clock table, but as I am not looking for "time spent" but rather "what did I do - what was closed and logged?" it doesn't seemt to be the right tool.

 I was a long time emacs user (5+ years), but left a few years ago at the start of my PhD, my main reason for abandoning was to move to VS code simply for easier use of jupyter notebooks. 
 I need them to be easily sharable, so using ORG as a replacement isn't viable for me. 
 Spell check, autocomplete and documentation are also very important to me. 
 Does anyone have a good setup for editing Jupyter notebooks directly, without converting between formats in emacs? 
 If so, could you share your workflow, I'd be very keen to get back into emacs. 
 Thanks,

 Hey org-mode lovers,
 Have you ever been in the following situation?
 You have tried to understand a specific aspect of org-mode (say a command) and you have done the following:
  
you have played with the command (writing your own examples),
 you have read all the parts in the manual dealing with this command,
 you have read the docstring of the command,
 you have looked for explanations on the web,
 you even have read the source code of the command,
  
but you still haven't figured it out after all the efforts.
 I've been in that situation and I thought it would be easier if there were more examples.
 BUT THERE ARE MORE EXAMPLES.
 We just have to change our lenses to see them.
 What if we looked at org-mode tests as example…]]></summary>

 #+begin_src #+end_src 
 How do I make these headers to be capitalized? I have checked all my configs and there are no lines that said something about making the headers lower case. Interestingly, the Org website section 1.5 said that the default behavior should be capitalized, not lower case: https://orgmode.org/org.html
 There is this answer here but to switch to lower case instead: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/34931/org-source-block-in-lowercase
 So I decide to experiment with the "accepted" answer and tried with upcase
 (mapc (lambda (arg) (setcdr arg (list (upcase (cadr arg))))) org-structure-template-alist) 
 This yields error about wrong type argument listp, export ascii which is the list of argument/header to be inserted in the variable: org-structure-template-alist
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

So I was wondering what kind of more user-friendly list managers are out there that have a 2-way interface (read and write) with Org? Here are some qualifications:
  
I'm aware of Orgzly and I use it on my own phone but I don't think it's simple enough for someone who's not invested in making it work.
 I found a github repo for syncing with Wunderlist but learned that Wunderlist shut down 2 years ago.
 For some things (e.g. events), we can use a shared calendar and I already have such a setup going with org-caldav-sync. I was wondering if there's something similar people use for to-do lists, shopping lists, etc...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write a type class that will convert one type of error into another, e.g. Exception e => e -> Error. I'd like it to work for "wrapped" errors as well for convenience, e.g. Exception e => Either e a -> Either Error a. But I can't seem to get around the problem of conflicting instances.
 (if you prefer code in a gist: https://gist.github.com/evanrelf/f5773113b3a50e3aee7f44ba2cc05ea5)
 The error type's implementation isn't important, so we'll use a trivial one here:
 data Error = Error deriving stock Show deriving anyclass Exception 
 I tried using functional dependencies:
 class ToError i o | i -> o where toError :: i -> o instance Exception e => ToError e Error where toError :: e -> Error toError = undefined instance Exception e => ToError (Either e a) (Either Error a) where toError :: Either e a -> Either Error a toError = undefined 
 ...but I get an error:
 Functional dependencies conflict between instance declarations: instance Exception e => ToError e Error instance Exception e => ToError (Either e a) (Either Error a) 
 I also tried using associated type families:
 class ToError a where type Output a :: Type toError :: a -> Output a instance Exception e => ToError e where type Output e = Error toError :: e -> Error toError = undefined instance Exception e => ToError (Either e a) where type Output (Either e a) = Either Error a toError :: Either e a -> Either Error a toError = undefined 
 ...but I get an error:
 Conflicting family instance declarations: Output e = Error Output (Either e a) = Either Error a 
 Adding {-# OVERLAPPING #-} pragmas doesn't make a difference.
 I believe GHC selects instances based on the instance head, not the instance context, so nothing I do on the left side of the fat arrow will make a difference.
 Is there any other way I could formulate this to get my desired functionality, where the output type is determined by the input type?

 caseSort ["HI","hello","Heya"] == ["hello","Heya","HI"]
 The code that I have so far:
 qsortBy comp [] = [] qsortBy comp (y:ys) = qsortBy comp (filter (\x -> x `comp` y) ys) ++ [y] ++ qsortBy comp (filter (\x -> not (x `comp` y)) ys) countCap [] = 0 countCap (x:xs) | x == toUpper x = 1 + countCap xs | otherwise = countCap xs sortByCaseIn :: [String] -> [String] sortByCaseIn [] = [] sortByCaseIn (x:xs) = qsortBy (<=) (countCap (x:xs)) 
 The errors I'm receiving:
 Couldn't match type ‘[Char]’ with ‘Char’ Expected type: [Char] Actual type: [String] • In the first argument of ‘countCap’, namely ‘(x : xs)’ In the second argument of ‘qsortBy’, namely ‘(countCap (x : xs))’ In the expression: qsortBy (<=) (countCap (x : xs)) 
 I've been bashing my head against this for several hours now and I'm at a total loss.

original introductory blog post blog post, I’ve written about why we, at
Tweag, are developing yet another configuration language. Our goal is to empower
people to write correct, programmable and maintainable configurations. Nickel
targets Nix, Infrastructure-as-Code, build systems, and more. We think such a
tool would greatly help taming the growing complexity of configuring systems.
Since the first blog post, we have made progress. We backed up and changed our
mind sometimes. We had a lot of discussions, and we also experimented quite a
bit. There is still a lot to do and there are many imperfect aspects of the language
to improve.
Still, I think we have reached a point where Nickel is consistent enough for people

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am following up on this thread from a year ago and was curious what kind of Emacs to use on a Mac in early 2022. In the past, I used Aquamacs and the standard homebrew version of emacs but have stepped away from Emacs in the past 2 years for various reasons. 
 I now want to give Org-mode another try and thus want to get back at using Emacs. Other than Ord-mode I would mostly use Emacs to write Markdown and LaTeX files and potentially some R. 
 It appears Aquamacs is finally actively maintained again but there seem to be some advantages of sticking to a more "classic" Emacs port. Any recommendations are very much appreciated.

 If I only use the default config (no fancy packages, Melpa, Elpa and the like) would emacs do any network communications on its own as I start it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I'm missing something obvious when trying to split my org-mode emacs config into multiple files.
 Suppose I have two files: full-config.org, which serves as an aggregator of various configurations and specific-config.org, which is a config for any single customization.
 full-config.org contains the following code:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el :noweb yes <<./specific-config.org:disable-indentation>> #+end_src 
 and specific-config.org contains the following:
 #+name: disable-indentation #+begin_src emacs-lisp (setq org-adapt-indentation nil) #+end_src 
 What I expect to see after tangling the full-config.org is (setq org-adapt-indentation nil) in ~/.emacs.d/init.el; however, the file is blank.
 I can tangle the evaluation results of disable-indentation by placing () at the end of noweb, but I cannot figure out how to tangle the code itself.
 Can anyone please tell me if it is possible, and if so, how to do it properly? If it is not possible, is there an alternative way to update code in one "aggregator" file from multiple files without using transclusion?
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been on a quest to decrease my Emacs startup time and found something that I haven't seen mentioned on any of the blogs I came across on the topic. I think it is fairly well known that if you use straight.el, deactivating package.el in your early-init.el will speed up your starting time. What I only just found out is that on launch, straight does a lot of checks to see if any of the packages installed have been altered. This process can be changed by modifying the straight-check-for-modifications variable. I don't edit any of my straight packages by hand, so I have this set to nil, before bootstrapping straight. This brought my startup time from ~2 seconds to ~0.5 seconds, for loading over 200 packages. Maybe there are some reasons why one shouldn't do this that I don't know, but it seems to be a nice way to save some time!
 For more information, see this section of straight's read-me: https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#customizing-when-packages-are-built
 Hopefully this is of help to someone!

Here's one where I once found a list of signal words in text, e.g.: schema, model, allegory, analogy, hypothesis, metaphor, representation, simile, theory.
Source:
Writing as Thinking, Review of General Psychology 1, 2008, Vol. 12, S. 9--27.
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/1089-2680.12.1.9
This is but a piece of the overall Zettelkasten puzzle. Was nice to see English terms for a change back when I read this. Sascha and I practiced hunting for definitions and arguments etc. for a while but I just haven't found any other English source at that time.
Notably absent from the Oatley/Djikic article: a reference to Luhmann  http://luhmann.surge.sh/learning-how-to-read
For trivia, here're the titles of the notes I created that reference this book:

201306160915 Pen as thinking machine
201306160913 Analogy of note-taking to the Turing machine

 This only works with tables aligned to the left margin, and you need to run the function when the cursor is on the upper-leftmost pipe (first character) of the table.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[imo Linear types is really cool and could revolutionize how haskell is written (eg alternatives to "builder" patterns, IO monad, bracket functions, "move semantics", etc.)
 But! There's a few factors that seem to make it unusable except for specific safety-centric code (I played with the ergonomics extensively last year by toying with a linear version of prim (eg https://github.com/daig/prim/blob/%E2%98%B8/class/Cmp.hs))
  
Basic quality of life stuff around linearity inference eg in let/where/case binding
 Lack of effective multiplicity polymorphism.
 Lack of sugar for Movable types (eg primitive numeric types, for which copy and move are identical - Ur is not a good solution for these basic types imo)
 Lack of linear primops.
 Lack of optimizations making use of linearity eg to shortcut garbage collection.
 Lack of support for automatic lifetime management (This isn't really essential, but currently it's akin to using manual new and delete with static guarantees - which is great but still cumbersome relative to C++ RAII or Rust's lifetimes, and I believe could be inferred statically. Maybe it's actually possible just with library support for something like a linear ResourceT monad but that still feels a bit unsatisfying)
 As far as I can tell, it's solely the brainchild of Tweag - which is great to have industry support, but worrying in terms of robustness and longterm support as GHC develops. Linear types really needs fairly deep integration with the rest of GHC to be most useful.
  
1/2/3 are the only ones really stopping me from going all-in on linearity right now, but I expect all of them to get resolved eventually so long as 7 isn't an issue.
 So my question is: What's the latest developments on linear types in haskell / who is working on it / what's the best place to keep updated?

 main = print (!readNumber + 5) 
 which is syntactic sugar for
 main = do x <- readNumber print (x + 5) 
 What's nice about ! is that you can nest !s arbitrarily (and mix them with pure code) without needing to name any intermediate results; the desugaring does the sensible depth-first left-to-right evaluation you'd expect. (I'd note that ! is more powerful than the suggestion described here, since the applicative syntax doesn't neatly support nesting; complex expressions end up in a join/pure soup.)
 Anyway, I was just wondering whether the GHC language design team had ever seriously considered porting this? There does seem to be demand for it: many mainstream imperative languages (even JavaScript!) have adopted ! - they just pronounce it await (and it's only applicable in their "promise" monad).

 e^{\lambda_{1}} or e^{x^{2}}.
 I know I can wrap it in $$ and convert to a latex snippet but its not as fast and then the font doesn't match. Let me know if thats the only way, or if I can change the default latex font somehow.

 For example ~/Notes/Spring_2022/MAT2440/week6/wednesday_march_9_2022.org

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago I wrote a mini API server in order to let me leave "private comments" on a codebase.
  
Imagine being dropped into a new codebase and having the freedom to leave whatever todo items and breadcrumbs you want without cluttering the codebase. Imagine working on a client’s codebase and not having to worry about what you say, or who sees it.
  
I fully documented what it'd take to write a plugin for your favorite editor and wrote an example plugin for vim ... and then I switched to emacs.
 My emacs lisp chops are NOT up to writing a plugin that speaks to this API and displays the private comments inline. I'm imagining something akin to how magit shows commit messages inline. 
 I'm tired of not having access to this in my main editor. 
 If you or someone you know would be interested in writing this for me (as a public open source package, which i'll be happy to maintain) I'll happily pay you, or maybe donate the equivalent amount to help folks in Ukraine if you'd prefer. DM me here (or @masukomi on twitter) with how much you'd want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a long time vim user that converted (mostly to Emacs). I'm to the point where I only use vim in a few situations (quick edits, specific servers), and I've recreated my old vim config in emacs: 
  
Buffer management-ivy and fzf
 evil keys everywhere
 surround.vim-evil-surround
 vim commentary-evil-commentary
 persistent undo-undo-fu
 web-mode/php-mode
 lots of keybindings like 
  
(evil-define-key 'normal 'global (kbd "<leader><SPC>") 'ivy-switch-buffer) 
 (evil-define-key 'normal 'global (kbd "<leader>e") (lambda() (interactive)(find-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el"))) 
 (evil-define-key 'normal 'global (kbd "<leader>ww") (lambda() (interactive)(find-file "~/notes.org"))) 
 (evil-define-key 'normal 'global (kbd "DEL" ) #'switch-to-last-buffer) 
 I'm pretty satisfied with the workflow, but then I was satisfied with a pretty similar one in vim before. What stuff should I leverage that makes emacs superior to vim? Don't get me wrong, elisp is a million times more pleasant than Vimscript and that alone makes a big difference. Oh, I do use magit and org already so maybe I have my answer. Curious if there are other vim converts out there who have words of wisdom on what else to try in emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a cv in org mode and I want to make a list of publications. The way my cv class works, I use description lists with a date and a description in org mode like this:
 - 2018--2022 :: Job at company 
 which exports to:
 \begin{description} \item[2018--2022] Job at company \end{description} 
 This is then formatted exactly how I like. I really don't want to massively change the way this works, because it took me a long time to get the class just right, I've tried a few approaches (e.g. tables and tabularx) and this was the best way overall (so far).
 I want to be able to write this:
 - [cite:@key_20] - [cite:@otherkey_22] 
 and have it export like this (or equivalent):
 \begin{description} \item[2020] \cite{key_20} \item[2022] \cite{otherkey_22} \end{description} 
 where the dates in the square brackets for the \item macros are automatically pulled from the bib data associated with the relevant @key. (I realise \cite is probably not the best citation command to use here. I use biblatex so I'll probably pick something reasonable from that package. The point is the date thing).
 How would anyone approach this? I've fiddled about a bit and can't find a way yet.

 Does anyone have a good way of getting org-mode's clock tables to include the current time in?

 I'm asking this because I'm new and I'm wondering if I'm fooling myself that font colored levels does anything good. When I "discovered" themes and faces, I got pretty excited at the eye candy. At first, it looked really nice and seemed like a good idea. But now, idk.
 I'm curious, how many org mode level-colors (or other font attributes for levels) do you have? What does your different font attributes for levels mean?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use .emacs-custom.el to contain the customizations made by the interactive functions. However, I'd like to start moving some of that stuff out so I can manage it myself and make comments. I tried pulling some stuff out and putting into my init.el, but it didn't work. Namely, I pulled out these:
 '(org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color "#808080") :foreground "#FF00FF" :background "#f0f0f0")))) '(org-upcoming-deadline ((t (:foreground "#FF33FF")))) '(org-warning ((t (:background "#ffffa0" :foreground "#ff33ff" :weight normal)))) 
 Why don't these work within my init.el? I tried them before and after my (load custom-file).
 EDIT: Ok I see I'm supposed to use set-face-attribute. So I tried wrapping the above, but this doesn't work
 (set-face-attribute 'org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color "#808080") :foreground "#FF00FF" :background "#f0f0f0")))) 
 EDIT 2: I figured out the answer. A correct, commonly used form for set-face-attribute is like this:
 (set-face-attribute 'org-todo nil :box '(:line-width 1 :color "#808080") :weight 'normal :foreground "#FF00FF" :background "#f0f0f0") 
 And it probably didn't work with a straight copy because each of those first three lines, I think those are args to the function (custom-set-faces...). I don't know what it does behind the scenes, but I guess it wants its args in a certain format.

 I assume the simplest way would be to copy the content from the field, create a new buffer, paste the content to the new buffer, then export it to orgmode. But this also seems like a lot of work and I'd like to automate it if possible.
 Additional question for org-roam! I'd like to turn each reference into a node, so I can track each to what references I end up using more, which I tend to co-use, etc. Is there a good way to find every citekey in my bibliography, convert into something that org-ref, org-cite, citar, whatever can understand, and export them as nodes in one file with the citekey being in the :roam-refs: field?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, is there an alternative formulation of monad transformers that allow removing any reference to the base monad inside the e.g. bind definition of the transformer ? 
 The reason I'm asking for that is I'm porting some Haskell transformers to Python, for which I would like to avoid chains of lift.lift.lift... 
 A good way I found is simply to make a custom subclass of each transformer in the stack, so that they can be looked up for their lift by "tag" (the specific subclass) rather than numerical position (aka number of lift nesting). That would make composition of function using different monads very easy, even if they have not been designed to work together specifically 
 This would still allows the user to use multiple transformers of the same type (e.g. StateT), since the user can create as many subclasses of StateT they want for each piece of state.
 The problem with that is that if the user uses e.g. SubclassofStateT.pure(42), the base monad is not known , and has to be "resolved" later (when looking up the index of this class in the stack to lift appropriately). Unfortunately automatic, lifting is not enough since the definition of e.g. pure() would require the knowledge of the base monad which we don't have at this stage. Hence the need for an alternative formulation that allows delaying this knowledge to later.
 EDIT: fix typos

The trick will be to get correct OPML file formatting as an output via Marked 2, python, applescript or Keyboard Maestro.
Check this out for a first rough go. So far only one level thick. But this was easy. Each link on the central node is a child node on the mindmap. The full text of each child node is attached. Links within the text are not hot, but we'll see. 
I've attached the file so you can download, review, and explore the ideas. Requires an app that will read iThoughtsX files. This type of download might be a way of sharing a specific idea thread from my ZK with the world.]]></summary>

 We built it to help all people living in oppressive regimes communicate freely with each other, without fear of persecution because of what they said and who they are connected with.
 During the terrible conflict between Russia and Ukraine, people of both countries – I have friends and family there – could be at risk when sharing their opinions or just from being connected to people who were prosecuted.
 Every messenger app that knows who you are can end up sharing all of your connections with undesirable third parties, either as a result of a court order or as a result of attack - so even Signal, which has strong encryption, cannot protect your connection graph.
 Huge "thank you" 🙏 to 137 people who helped us test and improve the apps and to u/angerman who helped a lot by compiling our Haskell code to mobile platforms and getting it accepted by app stores – and we have just submitted the release than makes the app working on iPhone 7.
 From our experience – building mobile apps with Haskell is non-trivial but doable – so if you have complex client-side logic that benefits from the advanced type system, then Haskell is a viable choice – we hope our project makes it a bit better for others too.
 Let us know what you think about the apps and we are looking forward to releasing the new features, e.g. e2e encrypted WebRTC audio/video calls – see the full release announcement here.

 Trying to use "assertThrows" as I'm trying to learn about unit testing, but I'm stuck. I made a simple calculator and wrote some tests to test them, they are all fine, simply using assert, but as soon as I want to test that an exception is supposed to be thrown, the test fails with the following error message:
 type mismatch; found : org.scalatest.Assertion (which expands to) org.scalatest.compatible.Assertion required: Int assertThrows[ArithmeticException](calculator.divide(10, 0)) 
 Here is the code I'm using:
 import org.scalatest.flatspec.AnyFlatSpec import calctest.Calculator object ScalaTestingStyles class CalculatorSuite extends AnyFlatSpec { val calculator = new Calculator "Calculator" should "add two numbers" in { assert( calculator.add(10, 5) === 15 ) } it should "subtract two numbers" in { assert( calculator.subtract(10, 5) === 5 ) } it should "multiply two numbers" in { assert( calculator.multiply(10, 5) === 50 ) } it should "divide two numbers" in { assert( calculator.divide(10, 5) === 2 ) } it should "Throw an exception if denominator is zero" { assertThrows[ArithmeticException](calculator.divide(10, 0)) } } 
 And here is my simple calculator:
 class Calculator { def add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b def subtract(a: Int, b: Int) = a - b def multiply(a: Int, b: Int) = a * b def divide(a: Int, b: Int) = a / b } 
 It's the last test that is failing, this was part of a rock the JVM tutorial, but instead of funspec I'm trying to learn flatspec. Why is this failing please?

I would rather use a link-as-search to be as future proof and software agnostic as possible. I also prefer to use a UID internal to the body of the text instead of using a filename as I am very new to this and still changing my titles. To create an internal link, I copy the UID number of the filename (without the title) at the top of the body of my zettel. Then in my second zettel, I open a [[]] and inside I paste the UID number of the first zettel. The [[UID]] becomes green. When I hover on it it says that the file is not found. When I click on it, a search is launched and I have my two zettels that appear in the search bar but the target zettel does not open automatically. Is it normal? Should it only open in the search bar?
I saw that a "#" was sometimes set before the UID (in the body) of the zettel of origin. Is this necessary besides to denote that it is the zettel of origin?
Thank you and sorry if it is a bit messy (or very obvious), I am totally new with markdown and all of these softwares!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been studying FP for a while now in my spare time, mostly in Scala and TypeScript. I've gotten very deep into it. I feel I have a strong understanding of all the core concepts, as well as all the most common monads and other main design patterns. In short, I feel like I've got a very solid grasp of programming in FP.
 My problem lately just comes down to putting it all together at scale. Whenever I've tried to write a full app using purely FP design principles, it feels like it becomes a mess as I layer on more and more features. Because of this, I feel my main limitation is how to use functional composition for a larger system when dealing with network requests/responses, database operations, dependency injection, loose coupling, etc. I can write an application that does all these things, I just haven't been really happy with the results.
 What I'm hoping to get is one of two things. The first would be an example codebase, something open on GitHub. Something using, maybe, http4s and cats? Something that I can look through and study how it's been architected, maybe even transcribe it (I have found that re-writing code makes it stick in my head better than just reading it).
 On the other hand, maybe there are some tutorials/courses/etc out there which cover this kind of stuff. I really do NOT want one of those "This is a functor" type FP courses, I don't need that at this point. Something that goes much deeper into full-scale application construction is what I'm after.
 Thanks in advance for any help and guidance you can provide.

 I am starting study on history and philosophy, and want to be able to easily keep track of dates, events, birth-to-death of individuals, birth-to-death of nations etc. 
 Wikipedia does it using multiple pages for different timescales
  
Timelines_of_world_history
 Timelines_of_modern_history
 Timeline_of_the_17th_century
 1630s
  
My goal is to have navigable timeline to quickly find items of relevance. Is the above Wikipedia method the best available. Is there a mode that would help manage this?
 Also I want to use something similar to time.graphics for visualisation. It's quite expensive though. 
 Do you have any ideas, on how I should visualise timelines?

 I want to really learn Emacs and have gone through the basic tutorials. I want to start adding packages but it all seems so overwhelming to me. I'd like to add a package at a time to my basically blank configuration.
 Can anyone recommend just the basic packages I should have to do C/C++ and Python until I learn how to use those? I'd like the basic IDE stuff like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, file differences and a file tree. Recommendations? What else should I have?

 Currently, this fix is placed outside of mine use-package config of evil-mode. Could that be the reason of the message in mini-buffer? It would be nice if I could place this fix inside of my use-package evil-mode config.
 Here is chunk of code from my init.el : LINK
 Thanks in advance,

In that other thread I mention that I'd like to see a Scrivener for plain text. The key with Scrivener is that it has a lot of organization tools that AFAIK no other writing app has. But maybe I'm relying too much on the editor for the organization. I do keep a Zettelkasten but I only collect literature/thought notes (as opposed to "evidence notes" or notes on primary sources). Most of the texts I write need to combine the two.

 As a user, I am quite thrilled about named routes, as well as another change in Servant 0.19 brought by our team at Tweag (this time driven by Andrea Condoluci): better error messages for faulty routes. Writing routes in a type-level DSL can be tricky because errors can get hairy, and you lose a lot of the benefits of interacting with GHC's type checker. Both of these changes should help make Servant APIs more manageable, and more accessible to newcomers.

 What I want to do is to define a function insert that will run the appropriate version of insertXXX based on the type of the first argument, imagine something like the following:
 insert :: pair -> [(a, b)] -> [(a, b)] insert = case typeOf pair of (a, b) -> insertOrd (b, a) -> insertFlipped _ -> fail_during_compilation 
 Of course, that code is not valid Haskell, but I was wondering if I could achieve something like that using some type-level magic.
 Thanks in advance for any suggestion!

 (add-hook 'web-mode-hook 'something) 
 Tracking back a bit, I was wondering why .dir.locals were not being read, and it was because of the hook failure - all later hooks were being halted as a result, so it was not reading .dir.locals. I was only able to notice that by going to the *Messages* buffer.
 Is there a way to configure Emacs to throw an error when a hook fails? That would be much better for debugging and for making any errors obvious. I don't want to be lenient to hook failures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A very annoying issue with desktop-save and desktop-read that I'm encountering at the moment:
  
I'm starting Emacs in daemon-mode, and then open a client frame. I do 'desktop-read' and my saved desktop opens with the 10 or so frames I had saved.
 
When I go to one of the frames with a buffer I'm no longer interested in, and do C-x C-c, I end up not just closing that particular frame, but all 10 or so of the frames that were open.
 
The Emacs daemon is still running, and opening another client frame shows that the buffers haven't been killed, so nothing has been lost per se - it's just that the arrangement of all the frames I had is just ruined.
 
 Any idea how to stop this behaviour (i.e. being able to just kill one frame from the saved configuration)? 
 I should add that I have also been using the minimal setup for desktop.el as shown in the EmacsWiki, but I /think/ (but am not sure) that the problem is independent of this.

 I'm looking to write a function, for my role-playing games, allowing me to create random tables with elements that have weight.
 For example, consider the following list:
 1 - 20 : 2d6 kobold
 21 - 45 : 1 troll
 46 - 100 : 3d6 orcs
 Running the function I want to be able to pick 20% of the time the "2d6 kobold" etc.
 Ideally, the function would allow me to automatically execute the dice roll. I will have then, for example: 5 kobolds!
 Not being a programmer, all I can do is create a function to select an item from a "flat" list.
 Any idea?

To do this, I copied the the (defun org-meta-return...) from org.el to my init.el, and made some small changes. But it doesn't show up as an M-x command and it doesn't show up in the help system. 
 ;; Override for org-meta-return to use org-insert-heading-after-current instead ;; of org-insert-heading ;; I just copied org-meta-return and made some changes to the help text and the function call. (defun dls-org-meta-return (&optional arg) "MY SPECIAL OVERRIDE. Insert a new heading or wrap a region in a table.

 I would like help getting this to work, or at least understanding why "it doesn't work that way".
 (I know I can just call C-u C-RET to accomplish the same thing, but I'm learning elisp and I did the above work first, so I'd like to know why it doesn't work.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am pretty new to Haskell and learning it for fun, coming from Python. I recently tried to solve a problem using memoization, and I was surprised how hard it is in Haskell. I read up on a few things, for example
 https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Fix_and_recursion
 that provides the basic concepts. Naively, I had assumed that pure functional programming language should make memoization *easier* as there are no unintended side-effects. Instead, basically every approach I found requires me rewrite the function definition itself of the function I want to memoize. 
 Am I simply missing something? Are there some techniques for memoization that don't require rewriting the function? Maybe some compiler settings?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I'm reading "Thinking functionally with Haskell" chapter 2. I have questions about Exercise D in Chapter 2.
 The first part of the question was easy to understand. It is about comparing lazy vs strict evaluation about the expression
 head (map f xs) where xs is a list of length n.
 -> With Strict evaluation the function f is applied to all elements in xs after which the first element of the list is retrieved. So function f is applied n times.
 -> With lazy evaluation the expression is reduced to
 let p = map f xs in head (p)
 which reduces to f applies to the first element in XS. i.e. f xs0 
 ​
 In the second part of the question, there is a function filter p which when applied to a list returns a list of elements that satisfies the boolean test p.
 filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
 head . filter p xs returns the first element that satisfies the condition p. 
 In the question I'm having a hard time visualizing how lazy evaluation will work. With innermost reduction, the filter is applied to each element of the list and a list with elements that satisfies p is returned and head takes the first element of the list. 
 How will lazy evaluation work here? applying p to the input list might prune away elements from the output. 
 Is it that with lazy evaluation, filter p is applied only until the first element in the list meets the criteria as opposed to eager evaluation where filter p is applied to all elements in the input list?

 (custom-autoload 'async-bytecomp-package-mode "async-bytecomp" nil)
 (autoload 'async-bytecomp-package-mode "async-bytecomp" "\
 ("Byte compile asynchronously packages installed with package.el.
 Async compilation of packages can be controlled by
 \async-bytecomp-allowed-packages'.`
 `If called interactively, enable Async-Bytecomp-Package` `mode if ARG is positive, and disable it if ARG is zero or` `negative. If called from Lisp, also enable the mode if` `ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if ARG is \`toggle';` `disable the mode otherwise.` 
 \(fn &optional ARG)" 151 152 (face default) 207 208 (face default) 266 267 (face default) 323 324 (face default) 381 382 (face default)) t nil)
 The (" starting on line 3 and the snippet
 151 152 (face default) 207 208 (face default) 266 267 (face default) 323 324 (face default) 381 382 (face default))
 break autoloads for all sorts of packages in a way that is hard to track down (paren/quote mismatch leads to invalid autoloads for rest of the file).
 The snippet does not always feature the same numbers. Example:
 34 35 (face default) 91 92 (face default) 148 149 (face default) 201 202 (face default) 260 261 (face default))
 ...any ideas on this? These snippets have appeared in a wide number of autoload files-- magit, org-roam, valign, some ivy rich packages, etc. They do not appear in the upstream git repositories.
 ​
 They also reappear on package update, breaking large swathes of functionality.

Last Week
Wrote a scientist profile using The Archive and Marked2
Created a Poetry of Zettelkasting video showing how I use The Archive and Marked2 in my writing
Studied and became more familiar with the writer tools in Marked2
Read The Secret to Superhuman Strength by Alison Bechdel, a graphic autobiography. ★★★★★
Didn't re-engage with woodworking like I said I would last week. I'm trying again this week.
This Week
Refactoring Meditations on Self-Discipline 201901021303 from 90% quotes to 90% my assimilation of the quotes meaning. This book I onboarded at the beginning of my ZK journey. So I've spent about 10 hours over the last couple of weeks on this. It is a rewarding time spent refactoring this series of 30 notes—only a few more to go. "Ferraiolo, William. Meditations on Self-Discipline and Failure: Stoic Exercise for Mental Fitness. O Books, 2017."
Reading and onboarding "Paul, Annie Murphy. The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2021."
Spring Break, so no JAMM328 assignments
Re-engage with woodworking. Maybe having a tie-in with my ZK might help motivate me. Thanks, @sfast, for the link to a beautiful ZK cabinet.]]></summary>

For example I recently was chatting to a friend about a particular chess analysis he was experimenting with and although he is a non-programmer we were able to explore the idea very deeply through a quick 2 hour XP style discussion. He was 100% able to follow the data types and basics, but most importantly able to follow and guide the algorithms that resulted (as much as I was encoding english to haskell, he was also able to map back from haskell to his own internal model easily). 
 Haskell might be difficult to write, high learning curve etc, but its simplicity to read and follow is an underrated super feature?
 I blogged about it here (if you are interested in more detail of our XP session and some code snips etc) https://www.tomwells.org/blog/haskell_for_prototyping

 I tried multiple combinations, like "M-b M-b" but without any success. Is it possible to do this with global-set-key or even the :bind in use-package?

Would something like this be useful to you?
 Is there already a better way to do what my implementation here is doing?
 If you think it could be useful to you, does it seem intuitive to use?
 What features do you wish it had, what could be improved?
 If you are kind enough to do a code review, have I made any obvious mistakes? (I am still new to Emacs Lisp).

 ​
 I like [DT's theme](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/distro.tube ) 's theme - but how do i get his particular dark theme? Sorry if this is a very specific question...

 ​
 If not, is there any other place where i can just get the link for the theme, and apply it , like the one in the pic?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having previously worked with python, java, C and javascript I have developed some personal preferences for features/styles in programming languages that don't seem to be supported in more modern popular and low-level languages (Go and Rust).
 I'm wondering if these patterns are incorrect or if I'm attempting to use an object-orientated or functional style in a procedural language where it doesn't fit.
 The following are a few of my favourites that initially sprung to mind.
  
Chained operations on arrays/lists with functionally defined behaviour e.g. a.filter(a => a > 5).sort().slice(2).max()
 Wrapper alternatives to checking for null. e.g. extending the previous example ...2).max().else(0)
 Inline everything. e.g. if a is b then c() else d() and for 1..X as x do a += x
  
Am I a functional programmer in denial? The only thing keeping me from this conclusion is that I use a lot of oop techniques in tandem with the above.
 Or do I just want what's bad for me? In support of this is the fact that all the languages that allow these patterns are very generic and mainstream and don't have the careful direction of your Gos and rusts.

 Let me start by apologizing for this long ass post. I'm having trouble articulating what I want. 
 I am using Doom Emacs.
 There are two things I have been trying to figure out how to do. They are probably very simple but I can't seem to word them correctly in text so I am having trouble finding solutions. 
 I have ADHD, so things become very messy very quickly. If I don't lay things out a certain way I can become distracted and/or lose interest. One way to prevent this is by adding some flair to whatever I am doing. Does anyone have an easy way to add some style to an org document? Some ideas I had was to change header colors, add images (which I have sort of figured out), and maybe add borders or something.
 Another issue caused by my constant mental blockages is organization. When I had seen projects in the Doom dashboard I thought this would work but it seems designed for coding projects. How does everyone organize their org files? I'd like to find a way to set up a notebook type thing and open a directory in a buffer to navigate between the different files. Like a table of contents for every projects, and maybe a master TOC for all of my org files.
 Again, sorry for the long winded post. I suck at Reddit, and don't expect much response cuz long posts get ignored, but figured I'd shoot my shot.

 How are you doing?
 I'm getting excited about this post because when I understood how hl-line-mode works, it opened new horizons for me in the world of Elisp.
 I hope you will feel the same way after:
  
reading this post or,
 by directly reading the source code of hl-line-mode that can be found in the file lisp/hl-line.el (only 205 LOC skipping comments and empty lines).
  
You can get emacs's source code by running the following command:
 git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git

The general idea of the library may survive, but the library itself is likely about to become obsolete in 1--3 years because of technical changes.

 The creation timestamp is used as the headline; I might add an option to use the first line of the note content instead, like how Simplenote itself displays notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I released my new emacs package zetteldesk.el and made a post here for showcasing it. The idea was rather well accepted but I got a lot of feedback, that the README was too dense in information and it was hard for a new user to try it. I have tried fixing this, by integrating gifs for demonstrations instead of the raw info (which I moved to the wiki for anyone wanting it), adding a set of default bindings in the form of a hydra and a small sample config to get you started.
 ​
 I believe some people might have been set off by those problems, so I wanted to say thank you for pointing them out. I would love to hear what you think of it now, that I have tried to make it more explanative and if it is truly easier for someone to get started with it.
 ​
 As I said in the other post, I am very new to this, so I really appreciate and listen to feedback, as I feel the idea itself is good, but some parts of the implementation may be lacking, and who better to help me than the community.
 ​
 Thank you all for helping,
 Best regards,
 Vidianos

 I'm looking for a way to set a keybinding to switch the current active buffer to a specific one. In my case, it would be something like "C-c p" to switch to my Python run (*Python* buffer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since in my last Scala job we agreed that functions will be separate from data, I have often felt the urge to make many (most?) of those functions into extension methods. However, I felt it would introduce a bunch of boilerplate code that is not really necessary in any way.
 Now with syntax changes in Scala 3 generally, and also with the dedicated syntax for extension methods I don't see any reason anymore to not write code this way. Feels like the best of both words.
 Can you think of any reason why that would be a bad idea. While I don't have this problem right now, I can hardly imagine reviewers being content with such code in PRs, though I can't see a reason for objections either.

I'm just trying to get "my feet wet" a bit in browsing elisp and github. I'm guessing it's a local variable, being used only right there? That's Question1.
 Question2: So also, why does my search on github not find the reference for "ctf" in org.el? On github, I've set the repository to 
  
emacs-mirror
 mirrored from git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
  
Then in the upper left search text box, I do a "search in this repository" for ctf. It only gives me two files:
 test/lisp/epg-resources/seckey.asc
 doc/misc/mh-e.texi
 Question3: Why doesn't it also list org.el? Am I misunderstanding that search function? I was looking for any other references to "ctf" in the code base. 
 So that's my final question (Question4), is how do I find all occurrences of something in a repository using github web interface?

 Today I was trying to debug Scala.js within an IDE (both IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and VSCode).
 I've read some posts/issues/jetbrains issues but all of them are older (2016-17 era), but the most they managed to get is in-browser debugging.
 As years passed, is there a way to properly debug through an IDE?
 Also afaik debugging depends on sourcemaps, so does error tracking libraries such as Sentry. Is it possible to properly error track Scala.js?

 (defun imenu-literate (src-edit?) (interactive "P") (let ((imenu-generic-expression lisp-imenu-generic-expression) (imenu-create-index-function #'imenu-default-create-index-function)) (imenu-list-update-safe) (imenu-list-refresh) (call-interactively #'imenu) (when src-edit? (org-edit-special)))) 
 which is fair enough to understand and works but it sure feels like a Hack. Moreover I'd like to use this for more languages and I'd like to set the underlying mode through org mode as a pragma.
 But since this would be so convenient I wanted to ask if there is already something like this and I don't have to invent a new wheel.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I realized today from reading Johannes Schmidt’s paper1 is this:
In Luhmann’s second ZK:
Luhmann had 67,000 Main Notes (aka, Permanent Notes)
And he had 15,000 Literature Notecards in his bibliography (usually with about 10-15 bullet points of thoughts and page numbers per book or article he read).
This means for each book or article he read, he only creates on average 4 to 5 main notes.
The other bullet points (like the other 10 bullet points) he would just make references to the book and page numbers.
He would go to a card about Ideology for instance and write “For more on Ideology, see Williamson p. 256” for instance.
I think there’s an assumption out there that one ought develop every bullet point literature note they take.
Any thoughts on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm new to Haskell and trying to wrap my head around it, coming from imperative languages it's so different I might as well have never coded in my life. I find the syntax... strange, to say the least.
 I'm trying to understand a solution for a function that detects if a String is a pangram (contains every letter of the alphabet), here it is :
  isPangram text = all (`elem` text) ['A'..'Z'] 
 What I don't understand are those parentheses, they don't make sense to me. 
 As far as I can tell, elem takes 2 arguments; a character then a string. So what does (elem text) even mean? It has to do something, because if I take those parentheses out, the function no longer works. Yet (elem text) doesn't actually work on its own, so what is going on here?
 Also, all takes a list of booleans right? Assuming all is supposed to be applied to a list of booleans, I would think that (elem text) ['A'..'Z'] should get reduced to a list of booleans, but actually that code also doesn't work on its own. Where is the list of booleans all is applied to coming from, then?

 From the docs, (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) doesn't "make installed packages available when Emacs starts". So, does "installed packages" here refer to packages found in load-path? Also, what does it mean for a package to be "available"? Such that (require 'package) will work?
  
 Then, (package-initialize) will "load Emacs Lisp packages, and activate them". So what do "loading" and "activating" here mean? Does "loading" here mean the same thing as (load FILE)? Then "activating" means (provide FEATURE)?
  
 I've tried reading Elisp Packaging Section but still couldn't understand

 Menu to add/delete/change file and directory local variables and property line
 This is from my personal config. I thought it might be useful for others as well but too simple to be it's own package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On behalf of maintainers I'm happy to announce that bytestring-0.11.3.0 has been released. It will be a part of upcoming GHC 9.2.2.
 The focus of this release is an extended API for ShortByteString, submitted by /u/maerwald as a part of Abstract FilePath Proposal. bytestring is proud to be a part of this initiative, aimed to provide much faster and more principled FilePath type. Huge thanks to /u/maerwald for spearheading it!
 Other highlights from the changelog:
  
UTF-8 support: add Data.ByteString.Short.isValidUtf8 and use safe FFI for large inputs.
 Improve performance and laziness of unlines.
 Improve performance of intercalate.
 Improve allocations of singleton.
  
Many people contributed their time and effort to make this release happen. Just to name a few in no particular order, mostly according to git log:
  
Alexander Biehl
 askeblad
 Ben Gamari
 Dmitry Ivanov
 Jaro Reinders
 Johannes Waldmann
 Julian Ospald
 Koz Ross
 Matthew Craven

        <updated>2022-03-03T21:02:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So years ago I did a project with Scala and really liked it, and now that I'm very into functional programming these days I've picked it up again through a course I'm taking on Akka. I've got a lot more experience with Java & Kotlin than Scala, fyi.
 Anyway, while doing this Akka course I just decided to create a nice simple utility function within an object to abstract away all the boilerplate setup/teardown for actor systems during the course:
 package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.utils // BONUS: Not my main question, but why do we declare packages twice? import akka.actor.ActorSystem import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global object ActorSystemHandler { def useSimpleSystem(name: String, useSystem: ActorSystem => Unit): Unit = { val system = ActorSystem(name) useSystem(system) system.terminate() .map(_ => println("ActorSystem terminated")) } } 
 My issue is when i try to use this into one of my lesson objects, like so:
 package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.part2actors import io.me.akka.utils.ActorSystemHandler // This is the line for #2 import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorRef, Props} object ChangingActorBehavior extends App { ActorSystemHandler.useSimpleSystem("systemName", system => { // Do stuff with the system }) } 
 There are two main issues that occur:
  
When I type the name ActorSystemHandler, I get the option to auto-import it like usual in IntelliJ. However, when I actually click that option, nothing happens. The IntelliJ auto-import fails to do anything.
 I go ahead and manually add the import statement, as can be seen above. However, "io.me.akka" part of the import is shaded in that grayish color that IntelliJ uses to indicate something is not necessary.
  
I'm hoping someone can clarify the above points for me. Manually adding the import results in code that will compile/run, but I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Thanks.

 Then I want to extract client using:  UsersRoutes { usersId = fromServant @_ @(AsClientT ClientM) -> UserIdRoutes {..}, ..} = genericClient @_ @ClientM 
 GHC politely tells me that fromServant cannot be applied to the pattern, because type mismatches.
 How can I distribute captured id to UserIdRoutes in convenient way when I want to extract client from UsersRoutes using pattern matching?

It should be intelligent enough to account for cases where you're typing within the bounds of string quotes. The more I think about this problem the more difficult I think it would be to write such a package --- perhaps none exists.
 As an example, let's suppose we're writing Python (with | as the cursor):
 Basic:
  
variable-name|
 variable-name |
 variable_name | (conversion performed)
  
In quotes:
  
variable_name 'foo-bar|
 variable_name 'foo-bar |
 variable_name 'foo-bar | (no conversion as the user is typing within quotes)
  
In f-string:
  
variable_name f'foo {bar-baz|
 variable_name f'foo {bar-baz |
 variable_name f'foo {bar_baz | (conversion performed)

One of the most basic presuppositions of communication is that the partners can mutually surprise each other. Only in the way can information be produced in the respective other.
If...we seek communication with the second mind, we must seek internal possibilities for linkings which result in the unexpected (i.e. information).


In digging through the forums, it seems that some believe that Luhmann (and/or the community) overstates the importance of surprise in a Zettelkasten. If you are of this belief, can you enlighten me as to why you make this claim?]]></summary>

 I never use those keys. I would like to define at least one of them with a whole lot of bindings for entering unicode symbols (for instance, right-alt-A as the "alpha" symbol). I assume I'd want to set them up to act as "super" or "hyper" in emacs lingo.
 This is under windows, but I'm also interested in doing the same thing when I'm running emacs on an AWS linux box (via XMinG under windows).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
I checked a lot of content on this topic and everyone seems to have his/her own idea on what a zettelkasten is and that makes things extremely confusing when trying to implement it.
I study a lot of computer science content and want to organise it but I am not sure exactly how many folders I should have(some people say two, some three, some four), for what purpose(fleeting notes, literature notes, permanent notes, hub)  and how the notes should be structured and linked.
I apologise if what I wrote above is vague but it's extremely hard for me to phrase it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering transitioning from Joplin to something else because of Joplin's use of a database to manage note, which I think is bloated and unnecessary. However, there are some things that I'm still not sure about when it comes to Org-mode.
  
Is there support for embedded images? (like markdown's ![]() image links)
 Is there a reliable way to view/edit Org files on android? Viewing should be rendered, with embedded images, not as plain text.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been digging through documentation and searching the interwebs for the past couple days, looking for a solution but without much luck. The problem is this:
 I tend to have electric-quote-mode enabled when working with text and org files, for the sake of the typographic curly quotes, and I noticed that functions like forward-word and count-words-region are "fooled" into thinking that possessives and contractions are two words instead of one whenever the Right Single Quotation Mark (0x2019) appears inside a word as an apostrophe, becoming a "separator" rather than just part of the word itself.
 The straight-quote apostrophe (0x27) doesn't seem to have this problem. I found out that it's defined in the text-mode syntax table as a word constituent, so naturally I figured the easy fix would be …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear community, 
 I have a quick question regarding multiple selections with consult: Helm Buffer has a feature which allows selecting multiple buffers via C-SPC in order to kill those at once with M-D (see here). Does consult-buffer provide a comparable feature? If so, how could I access it? 
 Furthermore, I would like to generalize the question: Given any consult-* command, how can I select multiple items and act on those with the help of embark?
 Thanks in advance!
