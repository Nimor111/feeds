        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using org-noter to read epubs in org-mode, which works fine until recently. When it is a pdf file, everything still works as before. However, when it comes to an epub file, org-noter will not work. I'm not sure why this happened but didn't want to bother to dig into this issue because it is not the first time this package breaks down on me. Consequently, I need to think of a different way to read epubs and take notes in org-mode. Since I already use calibre to manage my ebooks, my new workflow simply combines using calibre links and xdg-open.
 The native ebook viewer in calibre allows us to export links to specific locations in the book. The link looks like "calibre://view-book/someid/somefomat?open_at=somelocation". Using xdg-open with this link opens the specified book at the exact location. The default viewer enables highlights and other annotation methods, which is also a plus. So all I need to do is to add a new link parameter for "calibre" in org mode and define a follow method. Below is a snippet.
  
(org-link-set-parameters 
 "calibre" 
 :follow 'my/calibre-follow 
 ) 
 (defun my/calibre-follow (path) 
 (call-process "xdg-open" nil 0 nil (concat "calibre:" path)))
  
It is a very simple implementation but it does the job. If you have a similar workflow of reading ebooks and taking notes, maybe this can help. Feel free to add anything. I welcome any suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm using doom-emacs and am trying to get syntax highlighting for the most part (I can manage without auto complete) on string literals that stores css / gql, for example this piece of code.
 const Wrapper = styled.div` width: 24px; height: 24px; margin-right: 14px; cursor: pointer; ` 
 ​
 export const schema = gql.gql` type Transaction implements Entity { createdAt: Date createdBy: User entityType: EntityType! fileIds: [ID!]! }` 
 ​
 Now I saw some people are using polymode and mmm, I was not able to make it to work properly, I could make it highlight the code but it was not possible to write anything inside the string itself.
 When I think about this, it's already happening with other languages like org-mode that can show syntax highlighting inside it's code blocks and even on js/ts files when you're doing the following:
 `this is a template string with a variable ${a == b ? 'this gets syntax highlighting' : 'so why styled cant??'}` 
 Any help would be much appreciated.

 I often use NodeJS to write scripts for my business. If I can replace that with elisp that would be cool.
 What else can I do with elisp besides hacking emacs?
 (I am aware that elisp = emacs lisp. The answer might be in the name? lol)

 For some reasons, I want to immigrate to European or North American countries and settle down. 
 I'd like to ask, what is the minimum requirements for a Scala Data engineer to pass interview for companies like FAANG?
 Should I start practicing Leetcode now? Is it possible that the algorithm questions in the interview would be easier for data engineers? How far do a data engineer have to brush up his/her Leetcode level to find a job overseas. 
 I'm asking these questions, because in my native country, Spark ETL engineers seldom write algorithm code in an interview while they are still able to have the same salary level with other kind of engineers such as backend engineers.

 Can I have keys behaves similarly in both environments??

 I've just managed to setup LSP-Mode on emacs. I'm using Clangd and upon opening a C++ based program I've been working on and entering "lsp-find-references" I saw that it wasn't finding all references. I believe this is because LSP-Mode didn't find a project file when I opened the C++ file and I pointed it to the root folder of the project, but of course it didn't find a project file because I don't have one (why would I need something so useless when I've got a make file :) .) Anyway I tried adding a compile_commands.json file that I generated using this web sight: https://texttoolkit.com/compilation-database-generator and changing the lines with "/path/to/your/project/" to point to my project.
 However it doesn't seem to have worked.
 How can I get LSP-Mode to recognize all the files in my C++ project?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Recently my Emacs got automatically updated from 27.1 to 28.1 (thanks Snap!) and oh boy am I regretting this.
 First, I had to re-install use-package because none of the packages seemed to work. Then I had to update all of the packages. Then Emacs almost took my system down with CPU usage because it was apparently recompiling packages without letting me know in either the messages or warnings buffers. Together with a bunch of stuff in between made this a fun adventure.
 Anyway, I'm lucky that people over at the Emacs Matrix room were able to help out, otherwise I'd be very much dead in the water. Especially considering my newness to Emacs.
 However, as the title says, there's still one issue remaining that irks me to no end. Emacs has lost the ability to collapse/expand headers of org-mode files. It could be a conflict between evil-mode and org-mode, but how do I tackle this? I have no idea.
 When I did C-h k <Tab> under an org file heading, I got this description:
 TAB (translated from <tab>) runs the command evil-jump-forward (found in evil-motion-state-map), which is an interactive native compiled Lisp function in ‘evil-commands.el’. It is bound to TAB. (evil-jump-forward &optional COUNT) Go to newer position in jump list. To go the other way, press C-o. 
 I don't consider having a huge or complicated config, so I'm not sure why the breakage happened like it did. If you have suggestions for future-proofing my config so that above disasters don't happen (or at least the chance of them get minimized), then please do let me know. Here's my init.el
 Thanks in advance.
 Edit:
 Thanks to @yantar92:matrix.org I think I know the root cause: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1604 - Seems like Evil-mode is not yet fully adapted to work with Org-mode in Emacs v28. Workaround is noted in that issue though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context:
  
I just got an Apple M1 Pro machine and am at the start of the evaluation period
 Since I know I’ll be programming in Haskell, I’m trying to use the language as I normally would on another machine
 Today I’ve observed some unexpected behaviour that is frustrating and which I’ve never noticed before
 As a caveat, I also have another MacBook Pro (with just the M1 chip) for work usage; I have installed Haskell on it too, but have never encountered a similar issue
  
Problem:
  
Please refer to the screenshot for the example
 In said example, I want to take a multi-digit integer and make a list containing each of its digits
 I make a ‘mistake’ in applying digitToInt
 After the error, I make the necessary correction by hitting the up arrow key, then moving the cursor to the start of the line so I can add map
 I type 4 characters: m, a, p and space – if you look closely you will see that the characters are indeed appearing, but digitToInt $ show 56 is getting replicated, and everything ends up being concatenated together
 When I press return, though, GHCi runs the command and I get the expected result
 In the last line, I press the up arrow key twice, and what’s being shown are the two previous commands concatenated together
  
Questions:
  
How can I eliminate this behaviour?
 What else could I try to better understand its cause (so that I can fix it)?

 System and machine information:
  
macOS 12.3.1
 M1 Pro 14-inch
 Using the ABC Extended keyboard (although the same behaviour was observed when I selected just the US keyboard)
 Restarting the machine has not helped; I’ve not noticed similar issues when using the regular command line

 Since I know debian tends to be behind as far as versions go I tried to follow the documentation here and use the elpa packages available through apt.
 Starting with elpa-evil (since I am new to emacs and want the vim bindings) I looked in list-packages after installing it via apt.
 Rather than a built-in package evil was listed as an external package.
 I may simply have worded my search wrong, but I couldn't find a way to install since the install package command could not find evil, and list-package info said it was unsigned with no option to install.
 I wanted to know if I am misunderstanding something stupidly obvious since I am new, or if I should just attempt to use the git version and risk it not being compatible.

 I am focusing quite heavily on Node JS + svelte. I guess you could say I am a novice programmer. I generally build stuff for my self and my company. 
 I moved from Vim + Tmux to emacs today. I was not an advanced vim user (only 2 months.). But I moved because I wanted one environments that I could customize. 
 My question is this: do you believe learning elisp is vital to using emacs long term?

 But not many could, except perhaps only a handful of people. There were some really amazing projects done in Haskell. 
 There were massive financial tasks executed. There were payroll-related projects written in. 
 The most notable in the context of a pure functional language such as Haskell was Pandoc that had the Haskell basis.

 I would like to use the homerow keys hjkl (QWERTY) to navigate with my Dvorak layout keyboard, which would be htns. (My keyboard is programmed for Dvorak.). 
 I’m using Emacs from Scratch configuration, which uses evil mode. I see the two lines following, so perhaps I could just change them to “t” and “n”, but what about h and s?
 ;; Use visual line motions even outside of visual-line-mode buffers (evil-global-set-key 'motion "j" 'evil-next-visual-line) (evil-global-set-key 'motion "k" 'evil-previous-visual-line) 
 I assume everything would be different if I decide not to use evil mode? Maybe using something like and adaptation of: 
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-h") 'backward-kill-word) 
 Finally, replacing C-x (quite a reach on the Dvorak layout) with C-u (right under the left index finger) makes so much sense. Would this work? 
 ;; swap C-x and C-u (define-key key-translation-map [?\C-x] [?\C-u]) (define-key key-translation-map [?\C-u] [?\C-x]) 
 And does it work with daemon mode now? (Via launchd?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've run into this issue in a few recent elisp experiments. I want to use format strings with custom expandos to represent points of key-value data (that is, I want to print a formatted string from a object which has keys and values, like a bibtex entry).
 Normally I could do this with format-spec, and associate certain keys in the original object with certain expando letters. But often the data I am formatting either has many fields (more than 26, so a format-spec gets unwieldy), or has a few core fields common to all data points, but could have any arbitrary fields beyond those (so it is impossible to assign expandos to all field names). Biblatex entries for example have a reference key, 133 defined field names, and facility for users to define and use whichever fields they want! Even expandos for a-z, A-Z and 0-9 wouldn't cover all that.
 On the assumption that the field names are always unique within a single object, a good solution to this might be somthing like format "%(field-name-1) -- [%(field-name-2):%(field-name-3)]", so as to print something like foo -- [a:b]. The idea is that the expando names (field-name-1, field-name-2, etc.) are programmatically checked against the entry (or against a list generated programatically from the entry), so there is no need for an explicit list of expandos like format-spec uses. I think I have seen a few packages do things like this before, but can't remember exactly where.
 Is there a standard way to do this?
 TIA!

 A bit like you can use agenda and org mode personally but in a way that any tasks are available to all users, got a small team of dev's who all use emacs so be nice if we could integrate into our workflow if possible with out managing separate task lists?
 Or any other options with nice emacs integration both jira and trello never worked that well when we tried in the past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if it's feasible to move of libreoffice writer onto orgmode. Can the following be achieved, in a streamlined way (more or less):
  
modifying the font, color of header levels;
 having an always visible table of contents shown right;
 could there be something like "rendered view" if I only want to read the prettily displayed text and "working view" when I want to change or define meta things, i.e. :PROPERTIES, #+SEQ_TODO:, etc.
 applying different font color to some table columns and not having elisp logic shown below. Ideally such logic could be defined in emacs.el;
  
​
 Out of all these 2 and 3 are the most important, as my notes can be lengthy and I use ToC to quickly navigate. Having them as headers at the top isn't optimal as I'd always have to return to search again.As for #3, I'm having quite a few tables in my notes. At times, some columns are green, some are red. It's important as it helps differentiate.
 ​
 Can it be done? I'm looking for such orgmode examples, but can't quite find anything that fits the bill.

This, however, by default puts the tray icons into the echo area, of all places. Since all my other system information is in the mode line, I would much prefer them to go there.
 Does anyone know of a way to do this? The exwm documentation is very quiet on this front.
 Alternatively, is there another community where I could find exwm wizards to help me out?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit: I just had a look at the exwm source code, and it turns out the system tray is actually a window that just happens to be pinned to the lower right of the screen. That probably rules out any simple way of achieving this.

 Last time I used Scala I was lost and made very inefficient code, now I’m learning more about the fundamentals and such.
 My questions are:
 1.how do I know I’m using Scala as efficiently as possible? I am reading “programming in Scala” and some trending Apache spark books. Last time I wrote Scala like I would write Java and it was super slow. 
  
Is currying really used in team projects and should I dig deeper into it? 
 
Where can I learn more spark to tackle very advanced problems? I was thrown into the deep waters last time with spark and I was very overwhelmed because I didn’t know how to effectively use spark (still don’t) and all the tutorials were very basic and didn’t go into more advanced depth that I could use.
 
What are some quick ways to know when a problem can and can’t be tackled in parallel? Can any problem be tackled in functional programming?

 I’ve found a 7 year old “answer” that instead uses the directory names which is both unrobust and does not actually use the tag metadata.
 I also read a comment from several years ago in which the poster described setting the default browser view sorting method to albums. This suggested to me that I might be able to use 'info-albumartist (instead of 'info-album) from the EMMS manual but using the former resulted in Invalid function: "Can’t sort unknown mapping!".
 It surprises me that no one appears to have solved this by now! Have I missed something? Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question might sound provocative but it isn't my intention. I'm genuinely curious why emacs has the concepts of "major" and "minor" modes. 
 I'm no elisp guru but to me it seems that a minor mode can do everything a major mode can: they both have hooks, key bindings, custom variables, etc. The only real difference AFAIK is that major modes are mutually exclusive. And even the latter wouldn't be hard to implement for minor modes by adding something like a boolean variable is-mutually-exclusive or a parameter. Yet the separation increases code complexity by separating the two and adding little idiosyncrasies to each.
 Moreover, the distinction introduces undue cognitive overhead by having us think of a mode as being the "main" or "most important" one in any given context. Why is that? Why e.g. should I think of js-mode as being somehow more "major" than lsp-mode even though the latter is the main driver of my editing process? It feels like maybe major and minor modes were abstractions designed to guide the process of creating packages but nowadays I see that as doing more harm than good.
 So, why not treat them on an equal footing? Do away with major and minor, and just have modes. To me it would decrease code complexity and reduce the cognitive overhead. But I'm not the expert here so I'm really curious about what you think about all this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm slowly learning elisp, and, as part of some org file processing that I want to do, I need to replace the content part of org-mode links (which are of the form: [[path][content]]) in a buffer. After looking around for a function that does that I couldn't find it, so I thought a good training might be to try to write it from sratch. I came up with:
 (defun inwit/replace-org-link-description (link new-description) (setq content-start-point (org-element-property :contents-begin link)) (setq content-end-point (org-element-property :contents-end link)) (setq len-thing-to-remove (- content-end-point content-start-point)) (setq len-thing-to-add (length new-description)) (setq offset-delta (- len-thing-to-add len-thing-to-remove)) (delete-region content-start-point content-end-point) (goto-char (+ content-start-point offset-delta)) (insert new-description) ) 
 However, this doesn't quite work, especially if it is run sequentially over several links in a buffer, because the substitutions (both the deletions and the insertions) start missing the correct spots after the first replacement, which works fine. What is happening here? I know that delete-region leaves the point where it should, and I thought that also insert does place the point after the insertion. However, I don't see how sequential calls to this function in a map loop can miss the right spots after the first one. It's like the numbering of the positions in the buffer does not update with my substitutions.
 In other words, is there a way to update the buffer so the following calls to my function can refer to the actual positions of the already modified buffer? Or, am I missing the point and there is a much better way to approach this task?

Rather than try to update these packages, if they've even been fixed, I've just removed them since I haven't used most of them in a long time anyway. (I only use Emacs to run Elfeed anymore.) Notably use-package 2.4 is incompatible with Emacs 28, so I had to upgrade to 2.4.1. Evil currently has no releases compatible with Emacs 28, so I just picked the latest commit. Not ideal, but I will hardly use it anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview
 This is a new issue for me that started about a week ago.
 I started having issues with some git commands in when using magit and vterm recently. Specifically, git couldn't read my global config file. However, if I ran git from a non-Emacs terminal everything worked properly.
 I did a little research and learned that Emacs sets the following two environment vars:
 shell GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 
 These settings make git ignore my global config. Hooray for a problem half solved! Now I need to figure out how to un-set these variables in an Magit-friendly way.
 What I've Tried
  
After unsetting these variable in a shell session in vterm I can use the git command again but magit is still broken. 
 I also tried unsetting those environment vars in the script that I run to launch Doom but that didn't work.
 Finally, I also read in the FAQ that I should try exec-path-from-shell, which I am already using. I tried executing the exec-path-from-shell-initialize function interactively but that did not seem to help.
  
Does anyone know how to configure magit to unset these variables?

 If you worked at an enterprise and the security team asked you "why cant you just use visual studio like everyone else?" how would you reply? 
 For instance, my response might be "emacs is a more efficient text editor for language XYZ that I've been using for a long time" and their response might be "Fred in accounting programs in XYZ and they use <text editor that doesn't scare them>....". 
 I'm purposely leaving out a few details, but basically any logical explanation I have they have a response for. 
 Curious what you think, and thanks in advance.

 BOOM!!! Let's get to the point!!!
 What's magic when programming Elisp code is that at any time:
  
we can extract a little part of the program,
 replace some symbols by custom values,
 send it to the minibuffer with M-x eval-expression (or pp-eval-expression), press RET and,
 automatically get back some value in the echo area (or in the dedicated buffer *Pp Eval Output*).
  
In almost no time, misconceptions about what a program does (or why a program fails) can be spot that way.

 I've been an emacs users for a few years now. I know basic elisp, which means I wrote my own config and I can read and modify elisp snippets. I never created a package though.
 As the title suggest I'd like to write my own major-mode for a programming language, but I don't know anything about this topic, and I don't know where to start either.
 ​
 Can you recommend any resources or guides on writing a language mode from 0? Additionally maybe some simple (few lines of code) but quality codebases for language modes and examples worth studying?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 After trying a few effect systems (starting with monad transformers), it seems that most people consider the ReaderT eff IO pattern the most pragmatic way to handle extensible effects. This includes UnliftIO, which is considered "the good way" to do MonadBaseControl stuff, and some libraries even require UnliftIO instead of MonadBaseControl for unlifting IO.
 However, it seems that UnliftIO has zero support for Either-based error handling and ReaderT eff IO just assumes that you are using exceptions. Particularly after writing quite some Rust, I think that Either/Result is just a superior way to do error handling (specially with syntactic support or some abstractions to convert and generate error types). Unchecked exceptions in my opinion are bad, and feel like I'm back in Python-land where your program can crash at any time from anywhere without any guidance from type signatures.
 Are we supposed to forget about Either and typing and just embrace exceptions, or is there any hope in this regard? Can UnliftIO support this in any way? (I consider wrapping-throwing-catching-unwrapping Lefts more of a workaround)

 Any suggestions?

 Some time ago I wrote a script to provide tab-completion for CLI programs in haskell built upon optparse-applicative. Arguably, one of the most used such programs is stack, so here is a link to the gist of such script for stack: Gist
 Simply fill in the desired executable and a full path to that executable, save, and dot-source the script. (. _stack.ps1 for the gist above).
 Admittedly, there might be some corner cases where the completion does not have exactly same behavior in pwsh and in bash/fish/zsh due to architectural differences in completion engines; if you find them - let me know, we will find a workaround =)
 Tab-completion would work best in pwsh >= 6. PR to optparse-applicative to autogenerate this script exists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've made a small library with implementations of two truth maintenance systems (TMSs) available on Hackage and Github. They are translations of Forbus and de Kleer's justification-based and assumption-based (JTMS and ATMS) algorithms.
 TMS algorithms are classic AI approaches to reasoning about logical implication relationships. Code using a TMS defines nodes representing sentences or logical ideas, and how some nodes can be used to conclude other nodes. We can also identify "nogood" or contradictory sets of nodes. Some nodes are distinguished as assumptions, and the TMS lets us reason about how the belief or disbelief in each assumption impacts whether we should also believe or disbelieve other nodes.
  
In the JTMS, the believe/disbelieve setting for each assumption is set directly, and the JTMS maintains the believe/disbelieve status of each node based on the current assumption beliefs.
 In the ATMS, there is no setting of "current" beliefs. Instead, the ATMS tracks the minimal consistent sets of assumptions which justify belief in each node.
  
Please do not look for beautiful and pure functional algorithms here! At this point the implementations are direct translations of the original imperative Common Lisp implementations, implemented as a monad transformer, and using STT. A non-stateful re-implementation remains an interesting idea for the (non-short-term) future! I wrote this library to give myself a bit more insight into how these algorithms work on the inside, and some deeper practice with the state thread libraries than I'd had before, but I hope you find them interesting or useful.

I am still in the essential course, for months now due to not really having the patience of watching the courses ( which seems to be too dragged out for me).
 Previous to purchasing the course I had gone through the official docs and gone through the tour of the language which is like an overview.
 In your opinion wouldn't it be best to just get my hands dirty on a basic project after going through a quick start guide on Akka and checking the docs if I get stuck as opposed watching length time consuming videos?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a total Haskell beginner, and am definitely in way over my head, but here goes anyways. Basically, I want to transform a function from one that uses currying to one that consumes part of an array and adds its output to the arrays head. I have a set of functions that I can use for that:
 base :: a -> [a] -> [a] base = (:) one :: (a -> a) -> [a] -> [a] one f (x:xs) = base (f x) xs one _ x = x two :: (a -> a -> a) -> [a] -> [a] two f (x:xs) = one (f x) xs two _ x = x --etc. 
 However, one and two are basically identical, and also look very recursive. It feels like there should be some way to write one function that would work for all length functions, but I have no idea how that would work.
 Any help would be appreciated!

 if you set (setq tab-always-indent 'complete), pressing tab in elisp buffer first correctly indents, and then if indented it "tries to complete the thing at point" basically autocompletes, by calling completion-at-point. i have eglot and clang installed, and i expect the same behavior in c++ buffer, but pressing tab, only calls c-indent-line-or-region. doing M-x completion-at-point or C-M-i works, but its far less convenient that just using tab key. I'm aware that there are other packages that do implement compilation for you, but i try to use built in stuff as much as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I attempted to write alternatives to manage dependencies in Scala apps.
 Agenda there is:
  
Dead patterns. 
 DI frameworks.
 Cake pattern.
 
 Pure ideas. 
 Dependency rejection.
 Dependencies as function parameters.
 The notion of the context for a function.
 
 Tooling and approaches. Reader and friends. 
 Reader monad.
 Dependency as API detail.
 Making unique contexts is not simple.
 ZIO ZLayer.
 Monad transformers (ToFu).

 I am open to any kind of feedback. Please let me know in case you'll have any concerns.
 Thank you!

Theres a lot of cruft in there and some of the packages dont even work currently anymore, because they are no longer actively developed, things like irony, rtags, and elpy. I can also remove a lot of packages from my setup because I no longer need them. I've used helm this whole time, but I think maybe its time to give ivy a try and also switch to lsp. 
 Anyone else just start fresh after using their setup for a long time?

 some interesting things on function \(f(x) = x\) 
 which can be generated perfectly well to compile this to PDF, but is not so handy when giving somebody else this TeX file. I remember there was an option setting you could set, i.e. 
 #+options: tex:verbatim 
 but that does not produce what I want. If somebody could point me to the right the direction, I would be grateful :D!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, one of the main challenges I have when writing elisp is that I can't use edebug effectively.
 I write python during the daytime, and as flawed as Python (and its debugger) is, I have managed to create a comfortable workflow with dap-mode:
  
Set a debug point
 Run the debugger until it hits the breakpoint.
 dap-hydra shows a bunch of useful keybinds
 dap-ui-repl pops up, which lets me interactively try out expressions, inspect variables, and more.
  
Meanwhile, the current state of my elisp debugging is:
  
edebug-defun and (optionally) set breakpoint. However, the breakpoint is not visible in the buffer, so it's easy to lose track of.
 Run the function until debugger stops the execution. At this point, a new keymap is introduced with binds I don't know, that overwrite many of my regular keybinds. They can be inspected with ?, it's just a bit... jarring to have half your keyboard change meaning.
 edebug-eval-expression can be used to open a minibuffer to evaluate expressions. It's kind of nice, but it's not a replacement for a proper window repl as it doesn't show history. I often want to evaluate an expression, and look at the result as I'm evaluating the next expression.
  
Apparently ielm and running eval-defun is one way to get the workflow I want, but I'm having some issues there (probably related to my config). There is some discussion on it here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/36918/edebug-repl-ielm
 All of my issues can be solved, and I think ielm is the way to do it, but this just makes me wonder: How do experienced elisp programmers use edebug? It doesn't seem standard to rely on ielm.

 I was wondering what is the best way the search for a "magic string" that signals the beginning of some data. Seems like I need to go byte by byte, do a lookahead for the magic string, if it doesn't match, then advance a byte and repeat.
 Is this the approach? Is there a more elegant way to do this?

This library has been developed by a team at Tweag, contracted by Mercury. Mercury felt that Webauthn support was a missing element in the Haskell ecosystem, and wanted to contribute an open-source library to fill this gap.
The library builds upon two previous prototypes, in concertation with their authors: a hackathon project by Arian van Putten and an alternative implementation by Fumiaki Kinoshita (also known as webauthn-0 on Hackage).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm reading the free sample of "Book of Monads" (https://leanpub.com/book-of-monads/) and I'm a bit confused with the very first example, which is "relabel" function implementation. Here, authors introduces
 type WithCounter a = Int -> (a, Int) 
 type and then states that the type of "relabel" functions becomes
 Tree a -> WithCounter (Tree a) 
 But shouldn't it be
 Tree a -> WithCounter (Tree (Int, a)) 
 instead?
 Could anyone tell me, please, is it a mistake by author or am I missing something? I'm a Haskell newbie and the whole example breaks my mind really hard: it would never occur to me to rewrite the initial implementation of "relabel" like this.

 I'm taking a class on Functional Programming and I'm trying to write a function that removes all the integers that occur in one list from another. I basically just want to delete the value once. What I mean by this is that if I give the list [1,2,3,3,3] and [2,3] I want the output [1,3,3] and not just [1]. I don't know if it made any sense what I meant.
 This is what I have so far and it just doesn't work:
 deleteItem :: [Int] -> [Int] -> [Int]
 deleteItem [] [] = []
 deleteItem [] ys = ys
 deleteItem xs [] = []
 deleteItem [x] ys = delete x ys
 deleteItem (x:xs) (y:ys) | x == y = deleteItem (x:xs) ys
 | otherwise = y: deleteItem xs ys
 It doesn't need to work recursively, but this was what I could come up with. I appreciate all the help I can get!
 Thank you for your time!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
Quick question re: atomicity of notes and maintaining the flexibility and mutability that comes with sticking to one idea per note — while also making the most of the many possible connections a note could have.
How do you think about adding in links to other notes (each of which requires some elaboration/explanation for why they've been linked to/mentioned in the current note) without making the note now be "about" more than one thing?
Do you see the additional text explaining the inclusion of a linked note as 'not counting' towards the main concept of the note? Do you put the connections and links under a References header to separate in into different types of content?
The image below is an example of a note where I feel like I've managed to maintain the singular point of the note (what the concept of "in process" notes is in my system) fairly well but I can also see how paragraphs 2 and 3 could be seen as separate ideas to the main idea of the note. In that case, wouldn't it make sense to have that text appear as bullets under the Reference header?
I know there's no one way to use a zettelkasten but your thoughts on the way of thinking about atomicity when linking would be helpful.

 lisp (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "FiraCode Nerd Font" :height 140 :weight 'normal :width 'normal) (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "FiraCode Nerd Font" :height 140 :weight 'light) (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "IBM Plex Sans" :height 150 :weight 'regular) (set-fontset-font t 'unicode "Noto Color Emoji" nil 'prepend) 
 On Linux, this has worked just fine but on macOS 12.3.1 some special characters are not displayed properly (e.g. #x2b57 (HEAVY CIRCLE WITH CIRCLE INSIDE) or #x2b59 (HEAVY CIRCLED SALTIRE)). The necessary fonts have all been installed and I am currently using the latest Emacs version on master which is 29.0.50. Any help with this is highly appreciated.

 This is a follow up to my previous post (trying to control a small game made with apecs-gloss with the switch joy cons). The game was crashing so I parallelised the joy cons’ part of the code. Unfortunately, although now the input is read and interpreted correctly (I print it on the screen), the game, at best, only responds to the first 1-2 inputs and then crashes. Any help will be appreciated! Apologies if I made any mistakes in the parallelisation, it’s only my first experiment in this field 😊

 I wanted to experiment with scala and compare it to the scripting languages that I am more familiar with for this type of work (R, python, stata). Bottom line is that data science in scala is a bliss! I enjoyed mill to manage dependencies, ammonite to run investigative workflows, and smile to train/deploy statistical models. Also, writing data transforms, which is the bulk of most data science workflows, is so much easier in scala.
 I hope you will find the content interesting/useful, and I would welcome any type feedback. Even though I don't plan to do further work on the code base, I would appreciate any comments on this as well. I consider myself beginner-intermediate in scala and I have reviewed my own PRs, so conscious there's room for improvement :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Cross-posted from https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/71321/error-junk-at-end-of-line-with-native-comp. This issue is almost totally preventing me from using native-comp; any help would be much appreciated!)
 I recently switched to Emacs 28.1 hoping to use the new native-comp support. Being on Windows, I followed these instructions to install libgccjit, copying the resulting libgccjit.dll library to Emacs’s bin folder. However, upon doing so, I received the following warning whenever Emacs attempted to compile any file:
 Warning (comp): C:\Users\<omitted>\AppData\Local\Temp\\libgccjit-554575/fake.s:4: Error: junk at end of line, first unrecognized character is `"' Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): C:\Users\<omitted>\AppData\Local\Temp\\libgccjit-554575/fake.s:4: Error: file number less than one Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): c:\emacs\bin\libgccjit-0.dll: error: error invoking gcc driver Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): <filename>: Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Disable showing Disable logging 
 (Where <filename> is the name of each file Emacs attempted to compile, of course.)
 Curiously, when I launch Emacs from MSYS2 MinGW (64-bit), the errors disappear, and Emacs is successfully able to compile all files. What is going on here, and how may I fix it? All I know at this point is that the problem is probably unrelated to the dependencies to libgccjit.dll: using dumpbin libgccjit.dll /dependents revealed that Emacs’s bin folder already contains all dependencies of libgccjit.dll.

 File mode specification error: (error ‘tramp-file-name-structure’ didn’t match!) Recursive load: "/usr/share/emacs/26.3/lisp/net/tramp.elc ... 
 I have a completely valid usecase for opening such files with emacs in batch mode. This error occurs in non batch modes as well; both GUI and cli (-nw).
 I know these .zfs folders are special folders which is why tramp may be in use. Any idea on how to get around this issue?
 This issue seems like a bug.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get rid of line truncation across my emacs config in favour of visual-line-mode, but I'm quite confused as to the org-startup-truncated variable. I have  (setq-default truncate-lines t) (setq truncate-lines t)  earlier in my config, which disables truncate lines globally.
 If org-startup-truncated is set to t (as it is by default), I can see that emacs truncates lines in org mode
 If it is set to nil, I also seem to get the same result. Reading the docs for org-startup-truncated, I expected this to make org mode respect the default.
 Does anyone know what might be causing this? 
 I also noticed that the message shown after I run M-x toggle-truncate-lines seems to be backwards (i.e. it says that truncation has been enabled when it stops wrapping)
 Edit: I apparently had a hook that was enabling visual-line-mode in org mode, which was toggling truncate lines. I'm slightly confused why truncate-lines is connected to visual-line-mode, so if someone could explain that would be great (though my issue itself is solved)

 I was wondering if anyone has faced this problem before, or has any alternative suggestions. Were you too forced to give up on Emacs for mail?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Description of the problem :
As I work with my Zettelkasten, I see the fear of forgetting what I've construct inside grows and grows bigger as days pass.
I switched from explicite file names to ID names, so I am afraid of losing of sight the content of the notes. I think I will get back to explicite titles again.
I don't trust process I don't control. I need to feel I have control over the amount of knowledge I have in my Zettelkasten.
Solutions already implemanted :
General index of my whole notes with aliases and subject.
Subjects notes with inside logical organisation.
Zettel links to create connexion and meanings.
The big index : 


Baby hubs in building : 


I don't use tags : they become quite messy, useless, they create clutters but I have to remember tags as well to make a useful utilisation of tags.
What I want to know
How do you remember ? How do you know what is the content of your Zettelkasten ?
Did I miss something ? An important point ?
What tools help you ?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I am teaching c++ programming and one of the parallel things I am trying to transmit is the importance of not only a clear logic but also of a readable code, which includes proper indentation. In spite of the many ways to indent code that are present in emacs, vscode , etc, or even using simple tools like clang-format , students still manage to create and present code which is just not organized, putting everything at the same 0 spaces level or similar. Since sometimes I give them a template to work on, I want to mess with it by removing proper indentation automatically, so I would like to know if there is a way to "random indent" a file in emacs, like adding four space to one line, then zero spaces to the next line, then two and so on, so they will be forced to organize it.
 Thanks

 Hey Emacsers,
 Have you ever needed to rename a function that appears in several files?
 Let's see how we can do this with Emacs.
 In the post the fantastic rg.el, we've seen that rg.el is a nice Emacs interface to the cli ripgrep which lets us do searches for regexp in files interactively with rg command, get the results in a dedicated buffer *rg* (by default), browse those matches, modify the searches parameters and modify the matched regexps, all from within the dedicated buffer *rg*.
 In this post we see how to rename interactively a function that appears in several files usi…]]></summary>

 I followed the tutorial from Thoughtbot regarding writing a REST server in Haskell with Snap. Now, I want to parse data from this query string http://localhost:8000/sth?param=value.
 I tried with getQueryParam but doesn't seem to work.
 Code example: ```haskell -- in routes ("/sth?param", method GET getHandler)

 Really don't know how to continue, and I need that format to be backward compatible with the API served by a server that I want to replace with the Haskel implementation.

 I recently installed lsp-mode for the Node TypeScript project (using ts-ls) I'm working on at the moment, mainly just because I wanted lsp-rename. The problem is, it only works within src: If I rename a variable, then all files in src get updated, but not in my test directory, tests.
 A lead: If I delete .lsp-session-v1, then open a file in the test dir, then start LSP (and thus import the project) from that buffer, then lsp-rename (on a file in src) will also affect that one file in the test directory, but not others. ~/.emacs.d/.lsp-session-v1 contains no mention of the test file or dir in this case. It also doesn't work any more if I restart Emacs after this.
 I thought lsp-workspace-folders-add sounded good, but it doesn't appear to do anything except make it so that the rename doesn't even work across the files in src any more either.
 Tried renaming test to tests, didn't work. The fact that it searches src even though .lsp-session-v1 only mentions the root directory indicates that it has some fixed folder mappings. Adding more of these would probably be the best solution. But how do I do this? I'm not very advanced with this package or Emacs in general.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a macbook hooked up to an external monitor and use an external keyboard. I've already set it up in the MacOS terminal to use alt (option) keys as Meta in the options menu. So, I would like to disable the Right-Alt (option) key being recognised as Meta and use it to type special characters. I've found the setting (setq mac-right-option-modifier nil) and added it to my settings file (~/.emacs).
 Problem: If I launch Emacs program through Finder as any other program the setting in the .emacs works fine: 
 - Left-Alt = Meta key - Right-Alt is just Alt key 
 However, if I launch Emacs through the terminal (the way I would like to use it) the Right-Alt (option) key is still being recognised as Meta key. Is there a way to fix this?
 This is the setting that I have in my .emacs config file:
 (setq mac-right-option-modifier nil) 
  
OS: MacOS Monterey
 Emacs version: 28.1
 Default MacOS terminal app for terminal

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So. this just started happening yesterday. When I save a file I've been editing it tells me someone else already has the file open, although it's only my laptop and the username is the same. The server name sometime changes depending on whether I've been using my VPN or not though. I'm confused since I've used the VPN many times before and this never happened, but it's extremely inconvenient. 
 I can prevent using lock files I suppose but that seems like overkill, and this wasn't an issue previously. Anyone with advice would be greatly(!) appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-mode to manage my life (like any sane person would do :P) and also I use Feynman technique (it is super useful, look it up if you're interested) to learn new stuff or keep up with my chain of thoughts. Originally the Feynman technique involved with writing your thoughts, questions that you have and things that you learn in a notebook and review them later. Using a notebook is really inefficient to me coz it's hard for me to carry around one to take notes. I used to leave voice messages to myself via my phone and later on manually transcribe them and move them to an org file to organize them.
 Finally I spend a bit of time and created a bot that converts telegram (just because it was easier at the moment. Otherwise it would be easy enough to create backends for the bot to use matrix or whatever) voice messages to org-mode entries and store them in an org-file. It's trainable as well. So one can train it to be more precise. Therefore the more you use it the more precise it can get.It still is rough around the edges and I need to feature tune it, but it is usable and I use it all the time. I thought other people might have the same needs as I have so it might worth sharing.
 Heads up though, the bot is in golang (coz I wanted to finish it up fast, but I have plans to create a native Emacs module for it to replace the golang implementation)
 The repository is at: https://devheroes.codes/lxsameer/Orion
 Also it comes with a text to speech engine (Rigel dir in the same repo) as well that spins up a tcp server and reads out anything that it receives over the socket. This one is trainable as well. Since I use Emacs as my window manager (thank you folks who made EXWM) I wrote a simple client that reads any text that i want in any program for me. Refer to the read me for more info and you can find the elisp client at: https://devheroes.codes/FG42/FG42/src/branch/master/core/cubes/rigel/core.el
 Hope you find it useful and looking forward to your feedback :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I think I figured it out but I'm going to leave this in case it helps someone else. The "dimness" of the rendered face was coming from the italic property of the face (which is not set in the face customization). All italic strings just get dimmer with any TERM configuration that doesn't support italics (like xterm-256color or screen-256color). If I set $TERM to rxvt-unicode-256color, italics actually work!
 Due to issues with WSLg in Windows 11 (a long and disappointing story), I've switched back to using emacs in the terminal. Everything works as expected, except for a couple of face colors in Org Agenda.
 Though the attribute face sample in the customize facility looks correct, the actual face is always a dimmed version of that color (and that is how it appears in Org Agenda as well). This has the effect of making the text nearly illegible in most cases, and I refuse to choose an artificially bright color here because it appears correctly on other devices.
 I have cleared all other face attributes and still this odd issue persists. I've even inspected the face applied to the preview ("sample") text itself in customize and nothing seems out of the ordinary.
 Why is it not displaying the color that I have chosen??
 In this image, with foreground set to brightwhite, the face sample looks gray.
 In this image, with foreground set to color-82, the face sample look like a dark green.
 I've also fiddled with the color "themes" of my terminal, but those settings have no effect on Emacs, it seems that Emacs is displaying exactly the colors it wants to.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal is to make C-x <key> and C-x C-<key> keybindings more accessible since they offer a lot of possible and useful commands, but unfortunately, keybinding itself is uncomfortable for a lot of people using standard keyboards. My solution is (in evil normal mode):
 Pressing <space> and then <key> acts as C-x <key> . implementing this is really simple:
  (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "SPC") (general-simulate-key "C-x")) 
 Note: I'm using general.el package for convenience, if you know how to do the same with built-in functionality, leave a comment.
 Unfortunately there is still a lot of C-x C-<key> type of keybindings, which you still need to reach for control key after pressing space. Solution might be:
 while holding <space> press <key> acts same as C-x C-<key>. 
 Examples:
 <space>-s == C-x C-s
 <space> s == C-x s
 <space>-k-a == C-x C-k C-a
 <space>-k a == C-x C-k a
 <space>-q-w e <space>-r t y == C-x C-q C-w e C-r t y
 If there is some kind of method or hack to check if <space> is held, this solution becomes possible, making imo emacs a lot less painful to use.

 In a regular c file, again the space width is inconsistent with the tab width (8 spaces to tab)

 I'm using MesloLGS NF everywhere I can see inside M-x customize, and I even put :spacing m in init.el in custom-set-faces but doesn't work.
 How do you set spacing just for the space character? Are there other settings that determine font other than in customize -> faces -> basic faces -> default? How do I debut problems with font faces?
 EDIT: I've nuked my init.el file and now everything works, unfortunately I can't replicate the weird font config that caused different width spaces. :(. Extra info: deleting font cache (sudo atsutil databases -remove) did nothing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I 've been working as a software developer for the past 9 years and in the past year I started learning Haskell and FP in general. I know enough Haskell to make some simple projects (interactive clis, web server JSON endpoints) but those are toys projects and for sure not following best Haskell practices. 
 So, based on the above I have two questions. 
 Firstly what are the next concepts/libraries that someone like me should learn? What are some good resources for production code best practices?
 For reference this is just a list of the things that are in my TOLEARN list. 
  
mtl
 containers
 proper error handling
 lenses
 different preludes (RIO?)
 persistent
 conduit, pipes
  
Second, what would you be more interested to see in a demo project from a potential hire? Is the use of specific libraries (like the ones above) important or would you focus more on basic language understanding?
 Looking forward for your answers!

 I would like to expand on different conditions. By default Yasnippet only expands at word boundaries, so for example fooset doesn't expand, you have to type a space between the snippet that you want to expand. As you can see this is a problem with the first snippet because I would like to expand x^^3 to x^{3}. I looked for a solution to this problem and found this
  (setq yas-key-syntaxes '(yas-longest-key-from-whitespace "w_.()" "w_." "w_" "w")) 
 which let's me expand snippet on non-word boundaries. So now I can expand x^^3 to x^{3}. 
 However now the problem I have is with the set snippet. I would like that the set snippet follows the default behavior because when I type \subset the snippet is triggered when I type "set". Is there any way to tell yasnippet to expand the first snippet always and the second one on word boundaries?

 I delineate org-mode code blocks by setting the org-block face background to a slightly different color than my default background and setting its :extend text property to make the block look a bit cleaner (extends the color change to the end of the window).
 However, I'd like the background color change to render as a block, extending only partially, rather than the way:extend normally behaves -- extending to the end of the window.
 Is this possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 have been having trouble getting lsp-mode/eglot to work with tramp and python virtual environments. I can get lsp mode to work with tramp, but not respect python virtual environments. I have had a play around with pyvenv, but had no luck. 
 My current solution is to open a separate terminal, activate virtual environment and start pylsp from there over tcp, and then connect to it with port forwarding to allow eglot to connect to it. 
 Wondering if anyone has any suggestions or configuration examples on how they work with something like this. Doesn't have to be eglot either, just using it now as is easy to connect to existing lsp server with tcp.
 Cheers :)

 I just reinstalled Linux for the first time in like 15 years and I can't wait to muck around and have some fun doing some coding and using it for work and all that fun stuff!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switching from windows to MacOS I encounter a strange problem.
 One of my keybindings is C-f6 to switch to fundamental mode.
 Another keybinding is C-f12 for save and exit. Not working. M-x describe-key says: "C-f12 is undefined."
 Then I change it, keybinding C-f12 to switch to fundamental mode: now working! What??
 Then, another exmaple: on windows I had a keybinding C-M-<down> to unfold org headlines.
 On mac not working (yes, I have changed command to meta), but it doesnt work.
 M-x describe-keys says "C-M-down is undefinded", so emacs recognizes control-meta and cursor down correctly, but somehow its not linked to my custom function. Why? Why? Why?
 I'm about to explode. Tried whole night to fix/understand it ... I begin to believe my init file is haunted.
 I hope somebody has a tip for me what's going on, I would be super thankful.

So here's the complete scenario: I'm using Obsidian as my ZK platform and I decided to start by transferring some of my old notes into zettels.

 I'm running Fedora 36 (beta). And my laptop has a 4K display (Dell XPS 9305) so I have it running at 200% scale + Large Fonts (GNOME Accessibility option).
 But I also often use a 1080p display on the side, which runs at different DPI and 100% scale on Wayland. 
 Most apps when moved from one display to the other kinda work. But not Emacs, when I move Emacs to the 1080p display all letters are gigantic (like 200% gigantic).
 How can I make Emacs adapt to the different scale/DPI settings on the different monitors?
 I had a similar setup on Windows 11 and had not seen that happen.
 Emacs 28, vanilla; With mixed-pitch fonts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am a Haskell/cabal/GHC noob. I am also not a dev by profession - I am just trying to learn Haskell because.......Cardano. I am currently tinkering with cabal and I am trying to integrate Nix to it. According to the cabal documentation, I should just pass cabal --enable-nix, but the terminal screams cabal: no command given (try --help). How do I fix this?
 Also, is it necessary to edit the global configuration file to enable nix integration? If so where do I find $HOME/.cabal/config? I am on Windows 10, but I installed Haskell/GHC/cabal/nix using WSL2.
 Thank you in advance for any advice I could get!

Met with the New York Times writer Carl Zimmer as part of JAMM328 and found the conversation a wealth of ideas, many captured in ZK.
Trouble with near_search.py. Can you hear my screams?
Started a historical fiction novella using ZK! Excited about the prospects. I'm going backpacking to the protagonist's gravesite in the Rapid River Wild and Scenic River Area for research next weekend.
Refreshed kestrelcreek.com adding the Scientist Profile I wrote using my early ZK/Writing workflow described in a forum post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use markdown-mode for viewing and editing markdown files, typically with the .md extension. 
 I recently changed my markdown-mode config to also use variable-pitch-mode. 
 It seems that some part of lsp-mode is loading markdown-mode for rendering and in that case I don't want to use variable-pitch-mode.
 I tried:
 (use-package markdown-mode :mode (("\\.md$" . gfm-mode) ("\\.mkd$" . gfm-mode)) :diminish markdown-live-preview-mode :config (setq markdown-command "multimarkdown") (unless (bound-and-true-p lsp-mode) (variable-pitch-mode 1))) 
 Sadly this doesn't work. I guess at the spot in lsp-mode that calls (require 'markdown-mode) that lsp-mode is not yet fully loaded so the unless expression is not preventing the call to (variable-pitch-mode 1). 
 So how can I make markdown-mode use variable-pitch-mode but not when it's loaded by lsp-mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Doom Emacs, but I don't think that matters for this issue. I want to create a TODO from an email. I use mu4e for email and a file todo.org to hold my tasks and projects.
 Here is my org-capture-templates:
 (setq org-capture-templates 
 '(("t" "TODO item" entry 
 (file+headline "todo.org" "Inbox") 
 "* TODO %?") 
 ("m" "TODO email" entry 
 (file+headline "todo.org" "Inbox") 
 "* TODO %?\n%a\n%i"))) 
 (Why did that skip every other line?)
 I have a horizontal split with the left window showing todo.org and the right window mu4e headers. I put my cursor on an email header, invoke org-capture-templates, choose 'm', and a new TODO appears with the subject serving as the link to the email. Very cool. This part works great.
 Now I'm ready to get to that email. Cursor on the email link, either C-c C-o, or just ENTER, and now my left window has been split with the header for that email showing in the top left of the frame, the body on the lower left with the cursor in the body of the email, and the right hand window just shows the header of the email (same as what the top left shows).
 Not at all what I expected. To get out of this mess after reading that email, I can q out of the lower left window, and SPC b l to get back to todo.org, Then SPC w w to get to the right window, and SPC b l to get back to mu4e headers. 
 A lot of farting around with windows. Is this how it's supposed to work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent a lot of time on this because the most popular solution didn't work, and now that I figured it out, I want to post it so that, maybe, I help someone with the same problem as I had.
 To change the cursor color on emacs depending if you are or not in god mode you put the following code into your init.el file.
  (defun hook-update-cursor () (cond ((or (bound-and-true-p god-mode) (bound-and-true-p god-global-mode)) (set-cursor-color "lime green")) (t (set-cursor-color "cornflower blue")))) (add-hook 'buffer-list-update-hook 'hook-update-cursor) 
 If that doesn't work, try this other one.
 (defun my-god-mode-update-cursor () (cond (god-local-mode (set-cursor-color "lime green")) (t (set-cursor-color "cornflower blue")))) (add-hook 'post-command-hook 'my-god-mode-update-cursor) 
 The latter works for me, while the first doesn't.
 I hope I helped!!!!

Basically, I have a type that's roughly t [] a (for some monad transformer t), and computation happens in this monad (t []). The length of the list (usually around 1000) rarely (possibly never?) changes during computation, but using the monad incurs a lot of mapping over the elements of the list so what I'd like is a datatype that is efficient for this purpose, presumably by making the functor instance do the mapping in parallel. Is there a way to do that? (I saw https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa and also https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dph-seq-0.5.1.1/docs/Data-Array-Parallel.html but wasn't sure if that was the right approach).

 Do you have any advice?

 I'm looking for a simple solution for managing web bookmarks inside emacs and org-mode. I was sure that someone would have already done it, but it looks like I'm not using the adequate keywords since I'm not getting the expected results (surely the problem is with my expectations, as any Buddhist can happily say ). ;P
 There are a few known and documented solutions interacting other bookmarkers...:

 And indeed I couldnt install emacs 28 from https://emacsformacosx.com/ as the Mac gave an error (not able to scan for malicious content), but then I tried 27.2 ... again the same error but it allowed 27.2 to open nontheless.
 So far so good ... but now I'm stuck because I don't know where to place my init file (tried to put in different places like trial and error but ... no, not working). I googled a lot but couldn't find the solution. There has been said to put it in ~/.emacs but I dont understand where to find it.
 Also it seems Mac OS doesn't allow to create .emacs.d folder as there's a dot at the beginning.
 So does anybody know where can I place my init.el?
 Maybe total n00b question because Mac OS is unknown territory also I'm no coder just a prose writer ... but I love emacs :)

 I have a file path that I get from dired or from buffer-file-name - something like /a/b/c/d.pdf . I want to use this file path to create an org link that I can then insert into an org file. I believe the link is usually of the form file:/a/b/c/d.pdf. I want to add a description which should be d.pdf.
 Initially, I thought it would be easy to call org-store-link and pass in the file path and description to make it store the link but I checked the source code and the only useful argument that org-store-link takes is "arg" which doesn't seem to be what I want.
 I am still learning elisp so any pointers to a solution? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've installed eglot aiming for a very lightweight and minimal lsp experience for Rust and C (basically just some autompletions and some errors shown). My configuration looks something like this:
 ```lisp (use-package eglot) (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '((c++-mode c-mode) "clangd")) (add-hook 'rust-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure) (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
 (use-package company) (global-company-mode)
 (use-package yasnippet) (yas-global-mode 1) ```
 There're a few problems with this, though. On Rust mode, everytime I hover over a keyword, it opens like two buffers: One floating, and one on the bottom. All I want are some completions and some errors. How can I disable all the frills of eglot and rust analyzer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are at least two fundamental ways of reading email. The first, and the one I think is more common, is to open the inbox and choose an email to read from the list. Let's call it the random access method. The other method is to open an email, preferably the oldest unread one, and when you are done open the next one by pressing a "next email" button. Let's call it the linked list method. 
 When I read email using the random access method I frequently ignore email I feel are annoying to deal with. I also get drained of energy by having to repeatedly choose which emails to read. The linked list method on the other hand side steps both issues: I only have to make the single decision to read email and then I read the entire inbox.
 This package was born from the realization that I like the linked list method, and that I would like to handle more things this way. So what el-secretario does is that it turns different sources (e.g. org-mode todo items or RSS feeds) into linked list-style inboxes. And it doesn't stop there, it can also link different lists together so that email, org-mode items and RSS feeds come under the same unified inbox.

In vim you can reformat text with "gq{motion}" to format lines. It uses external programs to do so. However in Evil Mode I cannot seem to find its equivalent. Is there any solution to that? I Googled the problem but couldn't find the solution there either. Thank you!

 I found that all the tags in my growing journal document where not really being useful in HTML-exported form, so there was my motivation. Posting here as other HTML-exporting org-mode users may find it useful. (It's still in very early stages, written during the last couple of days, but it works for me.)

 Changing text at the bottom was extremely sluggish. Disabling font-lock-mode made Emacs instantaneous.
 After installing tree-sitter and enabling tree-sitter-hl-mode the edit experience is fantastic. Editing this large json file, Emacs is still slightly laggy but it is light-years better than with the regexp-based font-locking.
 Also tried tree-sitter while editing golang, no issues whatsoever. If you haven't installed tree-sitter yet, you should.

 I am having issues where emacs is breaking my programming flow by popping up new buffers in the wrong windows. Is there a package where I can decide what goes where?
 Ideally, I'd like buffers to pop up in the active window, and some sort of functionality that allows me to easily move a buffer to a different window (like move the active buffer to the window on the left). 
 Does something like this exist, and if not, what are the alternatives?

 Hey Emacsers,
 Do you know rg.el?
 rg.el is an Emacs UI for the cli ripgrep.
 What does that mean?
 Well...
 Let's say we want to learn how to write Elisp macros because it seems to fit with the problem we are facing. We've already read the info node about macros (M-x eval-expression RET (info "(elisp)Macros")) that contains many examples but we want more examples.
 We know that macros are defined with the macro defmacro, so why don't we search for calls of defmacro in Emacs source code to get usage examples of it?
 In the directory where we've cloned Emacs source code we can run the following command line (in a terminal) that searches directories for the regexp \(defmacro that are of type elisp, while respecting gitignore us…]]></summary>

On the one hand, we can use EWW for text and image only web interactions, but on the other hand finding websites that are intended to be viewed in a text based browser can be a challenge.
 I'm wondering if anyone has thought about trying to serve org documents directly, and use emacs as the browser. Org is basically equivalent to html in expressive power, and in places where it's not, it can be extended. Most websites would do well to be formatted like an org document and I'm sure many here would prefer reading documents online in org format, since if they were, then we'd get the benefit of emacs style navigation through them on the user's terms.

 emacs anyfile
 I have searched the usual places, /etc/emacs, /usr/local/share/emacs, and so on, but can't figure out where this behavior is being set.
 What is the simplest way to override this behavior, and just get a single pane with a buffer on "anyfile". (I don't want to have to type: control-x-1 each time).

 I learned some Haskell as part of a university course in programming paradigms and discovered that I like the language (and especially its theoretical underpinnings). However, I have not yet really been able to integrate it into my daily computer usage, apart from occasionally tinkering with my xmonad configuration and similar. Therefore, I would like to hear what you use Haskell for, to get some ideas and inspiration for what I could do with it myself. For example, do you use it only for work, or also for hobby projects (and if so, what could that for example be)? Or do you use it to automate tasks or process data (instead of, say, a scripting language like bash or python)?

 Using org-capture-finalize in org-capture-mode while having some certain text, example ("* TODO \n") exits without doing anything (similar to the functionality of org-capture-kill)
 My progress:
  (defun my-finalize-if-no-todo () (interactive) (setq matches (count-matches "* TODO \n" 0)) (if (= matches 1) (org-capture-kill) ;; Should be changed to function properly nil )) (add-hook 'org-capture-prepare-finalize-hook #'my-finalize-if-no-todo) ;; Is this the right hook to use? 
 Post notes:
 I tried to figure out how org-capture-kill does it, and it seems that it sets org-note-abort to t, but I am not sure how to do that in a hook. I tried to use setq and let, but I didn't manage to make it work.
 I am noob when it comes to Emacs and Emacs Lisp, so the answer might be simple.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we all know, we can view file changes in Magit directly:
 Magit changes
 The problem is, all the changes are displayed in a single Emacs window, sometimes I'm not sure which change belongs to which file. I know that I can go up to get the file name, but I feel it's a little inconvenient.
 I'm more accustomed to the UI that other text editors / IDEs are using, in which files are displayed on the left, and changes are displayed on the right. 
 ​
 VSCode's git changes
 The point is, I want to make sure that an Emacs window only shows changes in one file. When I go to the end of the window, I arrive at the end of the changes in the current file, instead of continually checking the next file's changes.
 Can I do it in Magit?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 It's been around a year since I jumped into Doom with no prior Emacs experience, so far I've become quite comfortable with using org mode (with evil) for writing reports.
 At this point I'm really interested in learning more about emacs, and possibly starting from scratch, as I've heard it's much better for learning than a pre-rolled config.
 Thing is, the few things that I've tried to do so far often ended up breaking my thesis setup, and I'm pretty hesitant to further experiment since "I broke my text editor, so I didn't meet the deadline" is really not a risk I want to take. 
 My goal is to somehow have a separate vanilla emacs installation/configuration, that I can just tweak from scratch, but which is totally isolated from the installation/configuration that I use to write my thesis.
 What would be a good (important: foolproof) way to accomplish this?

 Some questions I've been trying to figure out:
 - Native comp'd files are .eln (as opposed to .elc). Does it work like before, the .eln lives along side the .el?
 - Does it just speed up load time, or is there performance improvement even after it's been loaded?
 - Do the Emacs 28 binaries on the GNU FTP server have Native Comp?
 - Is AOT something different than Native Comp? It compiles in the background?
 - How do I Native Comp an .el file? Byte-Compile as usual??
 ​
 Sorry for the super newbie questions.

 I wrote my first project in it, a typing speed test for terminals. However I've only used oop-languages before, so I'm not sure whether I followed best practices when writing this. For example, I used data records to store the current state of the program in, and most functions operate on this data type. To me this seems kind of like reinventing oop-concepts in a functional language.
 The main logic of the program is found in app/TestState.hs, and app/UI.hs is responsible for drawing the tui. I sorted the functions by their usecase, exported functions coming first. I wrote a lot of internal functions for readability, and kept them pointfree when possible (is this sensible?)
 The code is available here.
 I'd appreciate any feedback on these points or on my code structure in general. Thanks for your help :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With very little haskell and zero prior chess engine experience it proved to be quite the wild ride.
 I feel i've made some very dubious code choices, especially in the move generation and move application departement (I really wanted to avoid using branching where possible so i abused the pattern matching as much as possible).
 I believe the GameTree code turned out to be fairly solid, though you're more than free to disagree.
 I'd love some feedback mainly regarding the "haskell-ness" of the code and what i could improve on.
 The engine is still a bit too slow for my liking (It beats stockfish 4/5, depending on the heuristic, with about 5 seconds per move) so I am thinking about reworking the move generation to use pin maps instead of generating pseudo-legal moves first.
 There is one small bug that is really annoying me: The engine doesn't detect threefold-repetition, even though it should be using the transposition table to keep track of what positions it's seen before. I'd be elated if someone manages to find an explanation for that.
 The code is here:
 https://github.com/stu214634/Chesskell
 Since this was a learning project the code quality varies greatly, still i hope it isn't too atrocious.
 Edit: Due to the way the transposition table is implemented building and running with multiple threads causes significant slow-down.

GHC activities report: February–March 2022 by Well-Typed
This is the eleventh edition of our GHC activities report, which describes the work on GHC and related projects that we are doing at Well-Typed. The current edition covers roughly the months of February and March 2022.
An Interface for accessing Environment Variables by Felix Springer
For me dependent types are the most natural way to semantically reason about programs. Unfortunately dependently typed languages are not really production-ready yet. Haskell and GHC often come close enough.

 I changed my org-outline-regexp to include the \f form feed character:
 "\\(\\*+ \\|[\f]\\)" 
 And I can now successfully go to the form feed character via consult-outline but this does not affect org-cycle. I'd like to show a line with the ^L form feed character as a separator even if it doesn't start with an asterisk.
 In plain outline-mode, this already works. Cycling now shows the line with the form feed character in any cycle state.
  
In case you want to insert the character in a file yourself for testing:
 (insert "\n\u000c\n") 
 For display of a separator line I'm using https://github.com/purcell/page-break-lines/ or https://depp.brause.cc/form-feed/ if someone is interested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I've set up lsp-mode, lsp-ui, lsp-ivy and company to work on my javascript files. As LS I am using the theia-ide recommended one.
 In my working enviroment I use Mozilla Rhino as the js engine so the syntax may be sometimes different to the standard javascript. Unfortunatly there isn't a LS specifically designed for Rhino.
 Everything seems to work fine except for the completion of imported files. In Rhino the import statement for loading another js file is load('/path/to/js/file') and what I am missing in my workspace is completions and suggestions for variables, functions and other stuff defined other files different from the one I'm working on.
  (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l" lsp-auto-guess-root t lsp-clients-typescript-npm-location "/usr/local/bin/npm") ;; tuning (setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000 read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024) lsp-idle-delay 0.5) :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t)) (use-package lsp-ui :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode) :custom (lsp-ui-doc-position 'bottom)) (use-package lsp-ivy :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ivy-mode)) (use-package company :after lsp-mode :hook (lsp-mode . company-mode) :bind (:map company-active-map ("<tab>" . company-complete-selection)) (:map lsp-mode-map ("<tab>" . company-indent-or-complete-common)) :custom (company-minimum-prefix-length 1) (company-idle-delay 0.0)) 
 In addition I have also a minimal configuration for js2-mode that I'm leaving here.
  (use-package js2-mode :mode "\\.js\\'" :hook (js2-mode . lsp-deferred) :config (setq js2-basic-offset 2)) (use-package js2-refactor) (use-package xref-js2) 
 If anything is unclear or needs more specification just tell me. 
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to try doing some bug fixes in public Haskell libraries. I found some unresolved bug reports in the hmatrix package that seem accessible so I cloned the package from github. 
 However, I am stuck at the first step of building the library from source on my own computer. I tried to build using stack but it fails. It's searching for a package version greater than a certain number, but it cannot find it. 
 I can install the package with no problem using cabal install --lib hmatrix, but is that useful for development / bug fixing?
 Any help would be appreciated

consultants to deliver by shipping code, and in this context shipping means
having the code land in the main repository to get deployed in production.
Sounds simple, right? Write code, merge it; repeat. Well, it gets more
complicated than that.

In this post, I describe why it can get difficult to merge contributions
and ways to circumvent these difficulties. My analysis applies
both to software consultants and also to open source contributors,
in a context where pull requests must be made and approved by a reviewer before merging.
I will go through a sequence of tips and tricks to have code land faster.
There is no silver bullet in this domain but rather a list of recommended

 Why? I mean, if one wants to process it serially, they could just use the normal foldl or foldr?

The build process look for all files in a directory and do some compiling and these files break the build process. To exclude the files starting with .#, I have to modify the build process, which sadly I'm not allowed to do. So, my only hope is to change the way tramp generate those files. Is there any way?
 I'm not even sure whether it is tramp which is generating those files, I would appreciate any help. Thank you

 Changes in these two files are quite evenly distributed. When I compare these two files with ediff, a first n completely highlights both files, one mostly in orange, the other one mostly in green. I guess that's because the diffing algorithm considers it to be one hunk? I see the details in words / lines by a visual difference in color. A second n unhighlights and a third n tells me there is no further difference list.
 Now this behavior is not very helpful. However, if I press ! I see all changes in detail and can easily navigate with n, p and copy changes a, b between the two files.
 One file uses cr/lf line endings (coming from Windows), the other only lf (Linux)
 Is it normal to press ! after an ediff session start? Is the initial all is different because of different newline encoding? How to ignore different newlines on first place?

 I could fix this after some days by downgrading the version of org mode. After a while I upgraded doom emacs and everyting worked fine again.
 Now I'm using my Laptop. Here I got the same problem mentioned first. But this time I have a much further update of doom. Additionally the old org mode version which fixed it previously, when using the exact same commit of the org mode package, doesn't fix the problem.
 Does someone else have this problem. It's either really hard to find something to this because of all the symbols or almost no one had this problem before.

Unfortunately I can't find it anymore.
 Is there any known impact of implementing functions with arguments expanded / eta reduced? Is one of those preferable (and if so, under what circumstances?) from the perspective of writing more performant code?

 I want to share I package that I have developed, which is egerrit, an integration of the Gerrit Code Review inside of Emacs. For more information and screenshots see my blog post https://niklaseklund.gitlab.io/blog/posts/gerrit_in_emacs/
 Here is some of its features:
  
A customizable dashboard
 Gerrit specific actions, such as setting WIP, topic, rebase a change etc.
 A review mode, with the ability to review a patch diff and add comments that can be published
 Functionality to automatically checkout out a copy of the change that is being reviewed so the change can be explored in its completeness
 A list of conversations with the ability to use it to jump directly to source code when interacting with feedback on a patch of yours
  
The package only uses built Emacs functionality, so its easy to install. If it sounds interesting feel free to try it out, the source code can be found here https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/egerrit :)

 Hey Elispers,
 Do you want to expand your Elisp toolbox?
 In this post we look at the catch/throw pattern offered by Elisp that allows to do nonlocal exits with the function throw that can be caught by the catch special form.
 For instance, in the following snippet, in a catch block:
  
we define a local list l,
 then we loop forever ((while t ...)),
 in this loop we generate a random (integer) number between 0 and 9,
 then:
  
 if this number is not equal to 1, we add it to the list l and we repeat,
 and if it is equal to 1, the throw statement transfers the control to the enclosing catch with the tag :one (we leave out the while loop and also the let block) which returns immediately the builded list l (last argument of the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having trouble understanding the general implementation of a binary tree. I am new to functional programming, and the assignment our professor assigned is given below. 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Using the following definition of a binary tree:
 data T = Leaf | Node T T deriving (Eq, Show)
 And the following datatype represents a traversal of a binary tree:
 data P = GoLeft P | GoRight P | This deriving (Eq, Show)
 Where This represents the entire tree. Now define the following function:
 allpaths :: T -> [P]
 Which given a T outputs all possible paths, P, from the root of the given tree to each of its subtrees. 
 Given input should outcome the desired output:
 allPaths (Node Leaf (Node Leaf Leaf)) 
 Output : [This,GoLeft This,GoRight This,GoRight (GoLeft This),GoRight (GoRight This)] 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ​
 I did the following, but I cant seem to find why my output is slightly off. Can you please help me figure this out.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 allpathsHelper' :: T -> P -> [P]
 allpathsHelper' Leaf _ = []
 allpathsHelper' (Node lt rt) last = [GoLeft last] ++ [GoRight last] ++
 (allpathsHelper' rt (GoRight last )) ++ (allpathsHelper' lt (GoLeft last)) 
 allpaths :: T -> [P]
 allpaths Leaf = []
 allpaths (Node lt rt) = [This] ++ allpathsHelper' (Node lt rt) This
 Output : [This,GoLeft This,GoRight This,GoLeft (GoRight This),GoRight (GoRight This)]
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It's just off in the 4th index of the list. 
 Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!!

 each of them has buffers it opens and buffers it should be opening. I want to customize the buffer order (the thing C-x LEFT and C-x RIGHT cycle through) so window A only opens files, window B only opens a language shell (typically python), a terminal or eww and window C only opens dired
 for example the two shortcuts should cycle like this
 ``` scratch

 GNU Emacs
 buffer buffer
 Python
 ansi-term
 eww
 buffer buffer
 dired
 buffer buffer
 file A
 file B
 file C ``` with the buffer buffers being buffers between buffers to signal to me not to pass it when cycling through buffers.
 the problem is I cant fix the order in place and there are always buffers getting stuck between the ones I need to cycle through

 I'm looking to create an interactive form, that fills out headers in an org-capture template.
 I don't want to "just" use the minibuffer, because it looks like a single line of text. I want to be able to fill in paragraphs of text within the minibuffer (or other kind of buffer), to be used interactively in the function.
 This way I can fill out a form in a multi-stage process. And it fills out an org file's headers, rather than e.g. a csv file if I used form-mode.
 Is this possible? Any alternatives that one might be able to recommend?

        <updated>2022-04-12T20:17:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I apologize for the possibly annoying question, but I'm struggling to get Emacs 28's nativecomp to work. There are plenty of guides/posts online about installing libgccjit with Homebrew to get it to work.
 But, I've been using MacPorts for a long time and really don't have any desire to use both MacPorts and Homebrew.
 When I install any of the usual suspect Emacs packages in MacPorts (emacs-app, emacs-mac-app, etc), I get the same issue when Emacs starts up: it floods the *Warnings* buffer with stuff like:
  
Warning (comp): collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status Disable showing Disable logging
 Warning (comp): libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver Disable showing Disable logging
 Warning (comp): /Applications/MacPorts/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/outline.el.gz: Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Disable showing Disable logging
  
Now, this is totally normal when GCC and/or libgccjit are not present, and a web search of these errors will find several forums posts and bug reports, etc. The Homebrew crowd just installs some specific GCC package and all is well for them.
 I pretty quickly realized that macOS's clang is aliased (or soft-linked, or something- I didn't investigate) to gcc. So, I suspected that I needed to install the real GCC from MacPorts. Since my $PATH has my ports directory prepended, running gcc from a shell does in fact call the correct, true, GCC.
 However, I suspect that Emacs still doesn't see the correct GCC when it starts up. If you're familiar with macOS and Emacs, you might know what I'm talking about when I say that I do use the exec-path-from-shell Emacs package, but I assume that it does its thing too late in the start-up process to help me.
 Does anyone know a straight-forward way to either change the GCC path(s) for Emacs early enough to matter, or just some other way to get nativecomp working with only using stuff from MacPorts?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 On the heels of last week thread about evil mode, I wanted to ask if there's a good guide to getting started with evil?
 I've been using Emacs with evil mode for a couple of years, but there's always something that seems to be breaking or misbehaving.
 The latest thing that was bugging me was undo-tree wasn't properly integrated with evil, so sometimes it just wouldn't work - even after I spent time looking into it.
 I dont need evil in minibuffer, but some commands are just too ingrained now (dd, G, / and so forth) that switching evil mode off is just as painful as keeping it on and living with issues.
 Is there a robust way to get evil mode going? A guide? Much as I love modal editing my only other option is to embrace emacs way and disable evil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reorganizing my Zettelkasten. Part of that involves combining multiple sub-atomic Zettels into a single Zettel. The thing is, removing the old Zettels manually can be time-consuming, specially if they're many.
In my case, performing one or multiple searches will turn up all of the Zettels. Also, in some cases, the Zettels' unique identifiers are listed in a different Zettel. Perhaps there's a way to remove the Zettels given a list of unique identifiers. And in fact, there is. That's the solution that user Raffa over at Askubuntu proposed: https://askubuntu.com/a/1401828/1555551
I didn't consider Obsidian, my Zettelkasten software, because there's no feature to help with this and I don't trust third-party plugins.
Hopefully this knowledge is of use to someone.]]></summary>

 In other modern text editors like VSCode or JetBrains, the search panel is always there when I'm searching. I can click on any search result on it, view/edit the target file, while in the meantime the search panel doesn't disappear. But in counsel-ag, the bottom search panel disappears when I hit the Enter or Esc key on a search result. Can I just fix the bottom search panel and never let it disappear (Unless I explicitly let it disappear using C-x 0, just like other Emacs windows)?

 The same question applies in principle to org-mode too, where such a functionality would be fantastic too.

 trait Nat class Zero extends Nat class Succ[A <: Nat] extends Nat trait <=[A <: Nat, B <: Nat] { ... } 
 I'd like to define trait <[A <: Nat, B <: Nat] in terms of <=, noting that <[A, B] if and only if <=[A, Succ[B]]. I tried writing,
 object < { def apply[A <: Nat, B <: Nat](implicit lt: <=[A, Succ[B]]): <[A, B] = lt } 
 but this does not typecheck. It seems to me that I need some sort of casting to turn an instance of < into <=, which should be possible.
 How would one go about doing this?

 I wrote a comment on the post that I thought might actually be better here: 
 When learning functional programming, the day you learn what a catamorphism is, is an enlightening day. There's a lot of boilerplate here for what is essentially the definition of a sum type, and a function which takes one argument corresponding to each constructor. In Haskell, the first few catamorphisms people are generally introduced to are:
 bool :: a -> a -> Bool -> a bool f t b = case b of False -> f True -> t maybe :: b -> (a -> b) -> Ma…]]></summary>

For anyone who speaks German: Would you mind translating any of these cards from German to English?
Here's a list of some cards to choose from:
https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_BG2a_3347_R
https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_BG2a_3338_R

https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_BG2a_3346_R
You're welcome to choose whichever one(s) are easiest. His handwriting seems a bit difficult to parse on them.
It would be great to see the nature of Luhmann's individual bibnotes in English.
I can, of course, hire a translator myself. However, I wanted to ask the Zettelkasten community here first in case there are any good samaritans that can help!

I was half watching a video on YouTube, and when it finished, a new video automatically played, which talked about a system called Zettelkasten. As it was explained, I realised this was exactly what I had been looking for, for years. Over the last few years I have read hundreds of books and listened to thousands of podcast episodes and diligently made notes on much of that content and then placed it in Evernote never to be seen again!
I'm still deciding on what tools to use to create my own Zettelkasten, and the Evernote tomb could be revived and used as a kind of fleeting notes folder, and then slowly go through the 12,000+ notes in there and transition them into literature/permanent notes, to convert that information into useable knowledge.
Since discovering that video, I have listened to an audiobook version of "How to take smart notes", watched several videos from Bryan Jenks, Martin Adams and others, in order to have a really good understanding of how to go about setting up my first zettelkasten.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I am trying to wrap my head around completions in emacs. To begin, I am not sure what the definition of 'completion' in the context of emacs is, so I am using the term quite vaguely. It is unfortunate, but is perhaps a good indication of where my emacs knowledge stands right now. 
 I have figured out that packages like selectrum and vertico shape how minibuffer suggestions appear on the screen. From the vertico page, I then moved on to consult. My current understanding is that packages like ivy/helm/consult provide enhancements to emacs commands (and perhaps also introduce some new commands) for buffer selection, register selection etc., including algorithms and interfaces for showing sensible possible options for the minibuffer prompt. 
 However, where I totally get lost is company. What does company do? I am experimenting with lsp-mode, and it suggests using company. Does company also do the same thing as consult? 
 Any comments and suggestions like links to pages which explain this ecosystem would be awesome.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So as an example of what I mean: say I have an optics modeling program in which you can have a material with a refractive index and thickness, as well as functions with that material
 type RI = Double type Thickness = Double data Material = Material RI Thickness reflection :: Material -> Double -> .... reflection material wavelength = ...... glass = Material 1.5 100 water = Material 1.3 200 
 But I could also just build a function that directly take the refractive index and thickness as arguments, and use the curried values to represent the materials
 reflection :: RI -> Thickness -> Double -> .... reflection ri thickness wavelength = .... glass = reflection 1.5 100 water = reflection 1.3 200 
 Are the disadvantages to using currying as a way to store values in this way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I guess this is your once in a while odd thread. :) 
 I’ll start from the get go. I have always been rather fascinated with keyboard and cli only life. Just breeze through everything with commands burned into muscle memory. Feel like the computer is an extension of your brain.
 Fate made me a lawyer. I don’t write code and nothing even close. here’s what I do with my mac:
  
I read documents, laws, verdicts and the occasional city plan pdf file (Am a real-estate lawyer). 
 Write legal documents and opinions for clients
 Read and write many emails in several languages (right-to-left and left-to-right languages). Around 30% of my regular work day is dedicated to emails really. Extremely vital
 Manage personal calendar appointments via outlook (clients go through my secretaries)
 Manage personal To-do lists
 Listen to music, mostly through spotify or youtube 
 Browse interesting subreddits here and there
 listen to podcasts and audio books.
  
That basically summarizes it. 
 Now I’ve actually read and watched a fair share of information regarding EMACS. The ORG intrigues me quite a bit. But I don’t really know if i’m barking up the wrong tree.
 Do you think something like EMACS, as a window manager (on arch probably, which I installed before and liked the Pacman a lot) can replace all these different softwares (from outlook, preview, spotify [which i know has a cli version!], MS word, MS excel, safari) and act as a seamless “one-stop-shop”?
 Or am I better just sticking out to my iMac and dealing with current workflow. 
 Thanks in advance! I’m very much excited reading your answers! Have an awesome day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I have some experience with Java, Kotlin and Scala. My favourite language by far is Scala, mostly because of their support for FP and monads compared to the other two. I just started in a new job where I am able to decide what language to use for our new backend. I would love to use Scala, however, finding the appropriate libraries/frameworks for Scala seems like a hassle. For Java/Kotlin its a no brainer : Spring Boot.
 Because of this, I'm not sure if its worth to go for Scala even. 
 I have been looking at:
 Rest api:
 Play - No support for Scala 3 yet?
 Http4s
 Cask
 Akka http
 DI:
 No library - Cake pattern (or any other way without any library)
 MacWire 
 Datebase access:
 Quill
 Doobie
 Slick
 ScalikeJDBC 
 Trying to find out what we should choose is giving me a headeache. In my earlier job we used
 Akka Http, Cake pattern and ScalikeJDBC, but I don't want to use this stack just because I have experience in it. For example, a quick google search has shown me that the cake pattern really is not a good way to do DI (although I personally didn't have any strong problems with it, although it did became a little bit messy when the code base grew big). It just seems much simpler just to pick Kotlin + Spring boot.
 What do you guys think?

 I am trying to add a new language server for lsp-mode. My current configuration to add it is this:
 ``` (defgroup lsp-gobra nil "LSP group for gobra." :group 'lsp-mode)
 (with-eval-after-load 'lsp-mode (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(gobra-mode . "gobra")))
 (defcustom lsp-gobra-executable "<path to jar file>" "Command to start the Gobra language server." :group 'lsp-gobra :risky t :type 'file)
 (defun lsp-gobra-server-command () "Startup command for Gobra language server." (format "java -jar %s" lsp-gobra-executable))
 (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection #'lsp-gobra-server-command) :major-modes '(gobra-mode) :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on "gobra") :priority -1 :server-id 'gobra)) ```
 I have already defined a major mode called gobra-mode which is enabled when I open a gobra file. This configuration doesn't seem to start the jar file server. Manually starting lsp mode in a gobra-mode buffer doesn't seem to do anything either. Any ideas?

 Any ideas what this is? See screenshot.

 So, basically converting Mb back to b and feeding it to (\b->Mc) 
 So, why not just have an extractor with type >>~ :: Mb->b ?
 Why have bind take in a function, versus just converting types and piping?

 From my experience with to-do apps and ORG-MODE, I've come to learn that I need to protect my daily agenda, or it will simply grow and grow and grow. What I mean here by "daily agenda" is the list of things that I look at each day, or throughout the day, to determine those few things that I'm going to actually accomplish. As a microcosmic view, I might have the following on that list:

 I want all my Emacs keybindings to be consistent and make sense (for me). However, this does not come by default. I want to start from a scratch, so I would like to unbind everything. All Emacs default bindings, and plugin bindings (with the exception of Evil Mode).
 Basically, I want to things:
  
A way to unbind all default bindings.
 A way to prevent a plugin from creating bindings.
  
How can I do this?
 EDIT:
 I tried removing the default bindings with this:
 ```lisp (setq my-global-map (make-keymap))
 (substitute-key-definition 'self-insert-command 'self-insert-command my-global-map global-map)
 (use-global-map my-global-map) ```
 It almost does the job, except that some keys stop working properly, like enter, backspace, and escape.

I see a few problems with my notes:
1) There are too many notes that are not my own ideas, just things I've captured from other places. 
All this to say, I am thinking of starting anew. (I wouldn't actually delete any of my existing notes.) I feel like I have too much of a mess on my hands and want to begin with a blank page.
Has anyone else done this? Been tempted to and decided against it? Why or why not?]]></summary>

 There are no classes in Haskell -- it's not object-oriented.
 As you can clearly see if you search for Haskell programmer positions on job sites, there is definitely no money in Haskell.
 Whenever one encounters Haskell for the first time, they usually ask questions like "but how do you do X without a state" which Haskell programmers are tired of explaining.
 And a lot of people make a point that Haskell is a beautiful language in theory but isn't very good in practice, which drives Haskell programmers up the wall.
 Conclusion: Haskell is communism.

Spent time developing programming chops.
Not much success picking up my reading pace in Effective Notetaking.
Created a new blogging workflow.
Started boxing training.
This Week
This week, I'll meet with the New York Times writer Carl Zimmer as part of JAMM328.
I'll be refining a shell script for inserting part of a note's file name as a title as the note's header.
Expanding on and refactoring zettel stemming from my ideas about thinking in built environments.
I will be reading some Rumi poetry that likely will stimulate ideas.
I'm currently reading: Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson and One Long River of Song by Brian Doyle
Trivia.
These are the titles of the last few notes I've created and am excited about. Show me yours! We are interested in seeing what you are up to, even if you have one or two newish zettel to share!

 I'm thinking about taking up FP with Scala, but a friend advised that it's a dying language, and moreover, whatever advantages it may have had have been mostly closed by newer Java/C# that now support FP constructs like immutable data structures/fields, higher order functions, streams/LINQ, pattern matching, lambdas, generics, etc. If you are well-versed in Java or C# and Scala, can you provide code examples based on real problems that demonstrate why Scala would still make a better choice than Java/C# today for new big projects?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: Am I using ExceptT correctly?
 I recently understood a bit about monad transformers, so I wanted to use them in my application. I installed transformers and started in a small section of my code. The following example used to have a lot of pattern matching, and my code would drift toward the right as I added more case statements, so I refactored it using ExceptT.
  getActivityAggregate activityId -> ExceptT.runExceptT $ do activity <- State.gets (Map.lookup activityId) <&> maybe (Left (ActivityNotFound activityId)) Right & ExceptT measurements <- State.gets (Map.findWithDefault [] activityId) <&> Right & ExceptT ActivityAggregate.build activity measurements & ExceptT.except & ExceptT.withExceptT mapError where mapError (ActivityAggregate.NoMeasurements activity) = NoMeasurements activity mapError (ActivityAggregate.MeasurementsFromAnotherActivity activity measurement) = MeasurementsFromAnotherActivity activity measurement 
 I want to bring to your attention that when I have a monad containing an `Either, I wrap it in the ExceptT constructor. Am I doing this correctly? Am I missing some function that already does this? Is there a terser way of writing the same? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Yesterday I upgraded from Emacs 27.1 (Installed via emacs-mac) to Emacs 28.1 (installed via Homebrew).
 Everything seems to work fine so far, except Arabic ligatures are broken: for instance, لا (ل followed by ا) only shows a broken line. با and نا are also affected, and only the first half of the ب and the ن are shown. 
 لا باس
 Another thing I'm noticing is that punctuation behavior got worse: if I type a comma, for instance, it's shown at the far right of the sentence, until I type the next letter, and then the comma is where it should be.
 ​
 Is there anything I can do to fix this?
 ​
 Thank you
 ​
 Edit: attach and fix screenshot

 How can I fix this?

 This is an implementation of a math concept of ordered sets and maps on various kinds of domains: bounded/unbounded, continuous/discrete. In essence ordered set or map can be viewed as a collection of intervals equipped with:
  
efficient search method to check whether element belongs to set;
 a suite of well known transformation operators: union, intersection, inversion, zip, map, flatMap, etc.
  
All implementations are thread-safe by design, cause underlying data structures are immutable and persistent (like immutable collections of standard library are).
 But please don't confuse them with standard sorted sets, here are Scastie examples to demonstrate the difference. Also some basic concepts are described in project blog.
 The project is in active development now, i will be very grateful for any feedback or contribution.

 Is there a way to avoid this? I tried to edit the /usr/share/emacs/27.2/etc/themes/tango-dark-theme.el or a local copy of it, but I can't find the line responsible for general background behaviour.

However, I've run into the problem described in this post's title. To make sure that I'm understood and to include all potentially important information, I'll elaborate.
I have an outline whose filename is 202204091330 s2 Obsidian.md. It lists links in the same vein as the outline example from your post about the script. This file is in the home folder of my Ubuntu 21.10. The output of zettel_outline --version is zettel_outline 0.1.1 (2016-01-23). Nothing weird appears in the terminal when I run the script:
zettel_outline -f '202204091330 s2 Obsidian.md' -a /home/annabella/Archive/Zettelkasten/ -o draft.md

Everything seems fine at first in the draft. At a closer look, I find the whole content of a Zettel that wasn't linked to, spread 16 times thorough it. Unlike the other Zettels, the <!-- § --> part doesn't include its unique identifier. I checked my Zettelkasten to see if its unique identifier happened to be that of another Zettel, but it wasn't the case. The Zettels from the outline don't link to this Zettel and this Zettel doesn't link to them.
Any idea of what I could be doing wrong? I'll include any information you need on demand.]]></summary>

 This happens when i call (rainbow-blocks-propertize-region (point-min) (point-max)), but as soon as i do anything like type or move the point or scroll, the properties of the first image disappear and the rainbow-blocks takes over the whole buffer, so all the saturated colours disappear, which i dont want. I want it to look like the second image all the time. This doesn't happen when i set jit-lock-mode to nil, but then of course i dont have jit-lock. What should i do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an old version of gnutls on my system, which I cannot uninstall (no sudo permissions). Instead, I installed a local version in my home directory and set PKG_CONFIG_DIR to point to it so that when I call pkg-config -libs gnutls I get the correct paths
  -L/home/user/.local/stow/gnutls/lib -lgnutls 
 I then tried compiling emacs from source by calling ./configure and make but got a linking error.
  ld: gnutls.o: in function `Fgnutls_peer_status': /home/user/emacs/src/gnutls.c:1505: undefined reference to `gnutls_session_etm_status' 
 Upon further inspection, I found that the linking command is something like this
  gcc -o temacs.tmp {CFLAGS} ... gnutls.o ... -L/usr/lib64 -lgtk-3 ... -L/home/user/.local/stow/gnutls/lib -lgnutls ... 
 The problem is that the old gnutls library in /usr/lib64 take precedence over the custom directory that is specified right before linking gnutls. I resolved this by changing the LIBGNUTLS_CFLAGS to include -L /home/user/.local/stow/gnutls/lib so that the this directory takes precedence over all other subsequent directories.
 This feels too hacky. Is there a better way to resolve?

 I'm trying to create a good writing config for my org-mode, but I'm facing something that I haven't succeed to overcome : having a justify text mode that live wrap line, not inside word but instead use a variable letter/word spacing to do it, like in a LibreOffice writer document.
 I would like this :
 This is a long text that have been justify with adaptive word-spacing and without cut inside words ! 
 Not this : 
 This is a long text that have been justify wit hout adaptive word-spacing and with cuts insid e words ! 
 Or this :
 This is a long text that haven't been justify there is just a limitation of the number of char by line with a line wrap. 
 Is it even possible ?
 Many thanks for your time lovely Emacs community ;)

 After writing to the init file it says:
  
By default, lsp-mode's keybindings are available under s-l(Super-l), e. g. s-l h h will show documentation at point. You may change the default prefix by setting lsp-keymap-prefix.
  
and that shortcut does conflict with my system's, so I wanted to make it something else, I've tried adding
 (setq lsp-keymap-prefix (kbd "s-z"))
 before and after the entering of lsp-mode, when added before it gave an error, and when added after s-z remained undefined, my init file doesn't contain anything other than the one mentioned in the link

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing some fun code that does symbolic algebra, and a part of that is also evaluating the expressions after plugging in parameters for the variables. Actually, profiling shows that 50% of runtime is spent in expression evaluation, so I'm keen to optimise this as much as possible.
 ​
 Here's an explicit example. Our expression has a simple data type definition.
 infixl 4 :+: infixl 5 :*: data Expr = Const Double | Var !Int | Exp !Expr | !Expr :*: !Expr | !Expr :+: !Expr deriving (Eq, Generic, NFData) 
 Next, evaluation is done by plugging in a vector of parameters. Specific parameters are chosen by the Int in the Var constructor, which just acts as an index for the vector.
 type ParamState = Vector Double evalWith :: ParamState -> Expr -> Double evalWith params expr = case expr of Const c -> c Var x -> params ! x Exp a -> exp (evalWith params a) a :+: b -> evalWith params a + evalWith params b a :*: b -> evalWith params a * evalWith params b 
 I can now define an equation of 6 variables as an expression, and evaluate with a vector of parameters. If I just write out the equation as a Haskell function, criterion says that it takes 9ns to run. The same equation in my Expr data type takes 70ns.
 This is by no means slow, but if half of my runtime is spent in evalWith, then every nanosecond counts!
 So, any ideas on improvements? Inlining evalWith seems to do nothing, I suppose due to the function being so simple already. Any help or insights would be appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a university assignment, though this question is not about any of its contents but rather about the build system.
 I have a coursework that implies building some sort of Haskell project. My professor wants to build my coursework using ghc (by doing something like ghc Main.hs). The problem with that is the fact that I want to use an external library - that I solved by using Cabal and everything works fine. What doesn't work (and I have no idea how I could achieve something like this) is making my project compile with said library when using ghc. Getting rid of the library or coding its functionality myself is out of the question since it's a complex library and I don't have time to redo it; also, including its whole dependency tree is not viable since it has 10 or so dependencies, and then each dependency has 10 other dependencies and so on.
 How can I make my project compile with the library while using ghc?
 Thanks!

 Yes!
 Even if the URL is displayed like any other links in the buffer (using the face org-link).
 Yes!
 But, if the URL https://orgmode.org/worg/ is used in a paragraph, it is a link.
 Yes!
 WHY?
 Because, while in both cases, in a property drawer and in a paragraph, the URL https://orgmode.org/worg/ is matched by the regexp org-link-any-re:
  
in a property drawer (specifically in a node-property), the URL https://orgmode.org/worg/ is not parsed as a link object by the Org parser (but only as the :value of the node-property object containg…]]></summary>

Overall everything works well except that I cannot get the spell checker to work. I installed aspell (also via homebrew) but when I add (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode) I get the following error message: 
 Error enabling Flyspell mode: (Searching for program No such file or directory ispell)
 It appears emacs does not look for aspell in the right path. Ant advice how to get this to work?

 Seriously, I dedicated a solid 2 months to learning emacs and org-mode this Jan, Feb (continuing to learn while using Agenda after that), and I feel like I have a super power that I never had before. I can "consume" so many little things, ideas, habits, reminders, etc., throw them into my system/schedule, and I've become about 1000% more productive, maybe more. 
 (But to be clear, I'm ADHD and was scatter brained before. And it's not just org mode that's helping me, it's also how I'm using it.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to ge the ol-emacs-slack package (see github issue here) working but am having some really weird results while debugging. I was hopeing someone more experience could provide some ideas.
 At the heart of it, there is a function ol/slack-store-link that I am trying to debug. Whats weird is that if I debug by stepping through the function in edebug it works but if I evaluate the function and evaluate it interactively it breaks. In particular the offending lines always seem to relate to somthing like (oref object attribute)where I get some error about attribute being void.
 The function does rely heavily on (I think) the EIEIO object system... could that have something to do with it?
 Anyone have any idea what could possibly cause that? I am sorry this is such a vague question but trying to create a reproducible example is clearly not so straightforward right now.
 ​
 EDIT: I figured it out. It was missing libraries adding (require 'eieio) and (require 'cl-lib) fixed it. Man that was annoying.

 Usually, left/right quotes and em dashes are the culprits. I go in and replace them by hand, but this is annoying. Is there a customizable setting to either automatically strip these unencodable characters on save, or specify (eg. with an alist) what characters to transform them to?
 Admittedly I'm not super familiar with different text encoding schema, so I'm asking this partly to bypass having to spend a few hours reading up. Resultantly, I'm not averse to changing my files to use a specific encoding that would bypass this issue entirely, as long as 1) it's reasonably future-proof and 2) I can still reliably isearch for these 'problem' quote marks and em dashes (ie. simple " character would still find them).

 I've performed an installation of ghcup using default values for all locations etc. I've removed all previous versions of ghc, cabal, package databases etc,
 The rebuild of the application and all dependencies proceeds as expected. Hoeever, running the generated executable fails with two messages stating that libwinpthread-1.dll and libgg_s_seh-1.dll can't be found.
 Both libraries are installed under the relevant GHC version directory.
 Have I overlooked part of the installation process? 
 Do I need some specific cabal options to get these libraries linked?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
How do people use the terms "zettelkasten" and "personal wiki"? What are the defining characteristics of each and how are they related according to your vocabulary?
How I use the terms:
A zettelkasten is a collection of notes in which the notes are not categorised into different folders, but organised via unambiguous links between each other (and optionally tags). There is no restriction on the type of notes that a zettelkasten can contain.
A wiki is a special kind of zettelkasten that only contains notes about objects. The links between notes are usually created automatically: a link is inserted whenever a term is mentioned that refers to an object on which there is a note in the wiki. A personal wiki would be a wiki on which only one person works, which is usually not intended for the public.
Is that how other people use the terms as well? @ctietze's comment here suggests that that's not the case – curious as to what other people mean by it...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the category "things I wrote because I wanted them for my own use", I released a pre-alpha of emacs-codeql
 CodeQL is GitHub's static analysis toolchain and its primary IDE support is targeted at VSCode, there also exists a neovim plugin which served as the primary inspiration for this package in terms of feature parity goals.
 emacs-codeql is fairly opinionated package that includes an emacs-tree-sitter based indentation and syntax highlighting mode for the QL language as well as a transient driven interface to interact with CodeQL databases, run partial or full queries, view ASTs, and other such activities. 
 It provides a full xref backend for database archive source files and also works over TRAMP (2.5.x recommended). It comes with automagic point-synchronization between source file buffers and their AST buffers as well as a lot of other small quality-of-life features focused on making CodeQL query development a low-friction experience on emacs. 
 For LSP support emacs-codeql recommends and cleanly integrates with eglot. It also depends on Projectile for project-root detection for eglot's new workspaceFolders initialization, which is required for the CodeQL language server to operate properly.
 Since the intersection between emacs users and emacs users that also use this one very specific static analysis toolchain is likely not that big, I don't expect this to be very popular. But I wanted to share it with the broader community to save someone else the hassle just in case.
 I'll be putting a lot of mileage on this package myself, so expect a pretty active feature churn in the coming months. As it stands emacs-codeql is ready to be used for most all general CodeQL use cases.

A lingering question I've had for a while: is it possible to turn off the word count that appears on the bottom of the editor whenever a note is selected? I generally don't mind it, but in some instances it can get a bit distracting to start building anxiety about how few words I've actually written over the last 30 minutes (or however long).]]></summary>

initiate another search with a different term,

I have a newtype that wraps a tuple and several functions that act on this tuple. Some functions use both elements, and others only use one of them. These two elements would live in separate tables in the database.
 I planned to have a function (let's call it getTuple) that creates the tuple by using two functions (let's call them getA and getB) that independently query the two tables. If I use getTuple in an endpoint that only needs A, would getB also get called?
 This possibility would be great if it were the case. That way, I wouldn't have to expose getA or getB, nor would I worry about optimization since the function would only query the relevant, minimum data from the database.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an honest question. Evil for vim-style key bindings seems to be dominantly popular now, among recommendations, preloaded distributions, and everywhere. What are compelling reasons NOT to use Evil in 2022? 
 I actually have never tried it myself, but now isn't for a convincing reason -- I just built my muscle memory on vanilla bindings and a few years ago added God Mode and helpers like Transient, so my reasons are more momentum than actual recommendable wisdom. 
 Is there a reason users, new and experienced, should decline to use Evil?
 EDIT I accidentally sparked the Holy War, which was not my intention. I should have explained where I was coming from with this. I have the opportunity to onboard college students to Emacs for work. It has been tempting to use one of the big dawg packages out there, Doom or Spacemacs, and I know that both of them use Evil. I have also had recommendations to use Evil pop up in discussions about ergonomics and my Planck keyboard. That bulk of recommendations are where the "dominant popularity" view came from.
 Perhaps I should have rephrased my question as to whether I should have my new developers use Evil bindings (a la one of the popular packages).
 Thanks for the bulk of the answers here; most have been insightful and useful data points.

It could takes hours to complete if we were to use raw JDBC APIs because of the way SQL database holds lock on the tables etc. Using stored proc to do the job isn't a good option so is there any good Scala or Java application framework to accomplish this task with performance efficiency? How can I achieve concurrency and a smaller size commits with the help of such framework? Thanks

I went in and manually changed all the values to the correct value but when exporting, it goes back to the wrong way. Below is a similar setup where in my setup they show up as 4/5 after the table but when exporting they show up as 1/2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am a beginner in Haskell interested in learning about the ways to manage/reason about effects in Haskell. I am working on a project with a lot of concurrency and effectful code in an imperative language, so I am also curious to see if there's anything I can borrow from Haskell and apply to the project to reduce complexity and allow me to reason about the side-effects that happen in the code and how they affect state.
 Where should I look to start learning about the ways to manage/reason about effects in Haskell? Are there any must read papers/articles/tutorials on the topic? 
 Right now I am reading/learning about monad transformers so I can try out the mtl library, is this the place to start? Where should I go after mtl, I have seen polysemy and fuse-effects are popular libraries.
 Thanks!

 My question is, in 2022, do I face any (likely) issues if I rebind C-m to something I actually use? I mostly use emacs on X. Single-key shortcuts are rare, and I would like to use as many as possible without breaking anything.

The effect semantics zoo by Alexis King
Not all effect systems implement the same semantics, particularly when so-called “scoping operators” are involved. This document collects examples that serve as useful “acid tests” for distinguishing a given effect system’s semantics.
From Partitions to Wordle - Type Safety with Phantom Types
Oops! It looks like we put things in the wrong order. The fix is simple, of course, just swap the order in the tuple. But it’d be nice if we could prevent these sorts of mix-ups from happening in the first place.

 It works well in an emacsclient session. But when I close that session after starting emacsclient again winner-mode has forgotten all layouts.
 "No further window configuration undo information" is the message.
 I would assume this should work because the winner-mode runs in the context of the still running daemon and client.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have this thing:
 data Thing a = Thing a data AbstractThing a = StaticThing (Thing a) | DynamicThing (Thing a {- 'cached' -}) (forall m. SomeConstraint m -> Thing a -> m (Thing a) {- 'update' -} 
 i.e. an AbstractThing is either a static record, or it's a record that can be updated in some environment. 
 I then have two categories of Thing; a Thing A, a Thing B, and AnyThing = Thing (Either A B).
  
 I can make prisms easily enough that convert Thing A to AnyThing and AnyThing to Maybe (Thing A).
 
I can even make prisms that convert AbstractThing A to AnyAbstractThing and AnyAbstractThing to Maybe (AbstractThing A), though these are quite messy to write.
 
I can write functor instances for Thing .
  
Is AbstractThing a similar construct? It's not a functor because the update function is contravariant. I thought it could be a Profunctor because it's covariant in cached and contravariant in update, but it only has the 1 type variable. "Why do you want it to be a construct?" - because when writing the prisms for AnyAbstractThing, it looked like a pattern was emerging (StaticObject and cached just delegate to the prisms defined over Thing, but the prism functions for the update function are similarly wrapping/unwrapping).

 Edit: Added question, why is there no right side equivalent of drop? drop will remove elements from the left, but is there something to drop from the otherside? Seems oddly asymmetric

 After upgrading to 28.1, the first and last lines work, but the scroll-bar foreground does not. It remains black.
 Here's the strange part. If I execute that line manually after startup, nothing happens. But if I first set it to white manually, then it does work:
 (set-face-foreground 'scroll-bar "white") (set-face-foreground 'scroll-bar "LightSlateGray") 
 However, that only works if I do it manually. If I put those two lines at the end of my ~/.emacs, it doesn't work and I still have a black scrollbar.
 It's not a huge deal but I do wonder what's going on.

 It's really great, it doesn't need to run in the background - it's very stable, and provides a quick way to navigate down branches of a tree (when basic undo/redo isn't enough).
 I've been testing it and reported a few bugs that were fixed by casouri, I've also made some minor contributions & optimizations myself.
 I think this package is ready for general use, recommend others give it a go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
I'm in the process of switching over from Obsidian to the Archive, in an attempt to make my note taking less distracted and more future-proof. As I understand it now, the best way to future-proof linking files is to enclose only the note ID in square brackets and put the title outside of it, instead of enclosing the whole title in brackets. I realize that by doing that I'm giving up easily linking whenever I go back to Obsidian, Zettlr, Bear or other note-taking apps, right? While this is of some concern to me, my main concern has to do with the seemingly immense work that would go into changing all the links in my Zettelkasten to this new format. I currently have around 700 notes and I don't even know how many links. To do this manually would take so much time and energy that I'm doubting if it's worth it. Does anyone maybe know of a way to do this efficiently, without having to manually change all the links?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intuitively speaking, a foldable allows you to list all it's elements and a functor allows you to apply a function to all its elements. But if a foldable contains elements surely you can map over them! Well no... Sometimes you don't want to and sometimes you actually can't.
 Consider Set for example. Given a set you can turn it into a list. But since Set is implemented using some sort of balancing tree that makes use of the Ord instance to provide fast membership lookup, simply fmaping over it will destroy that carefully crafted structure. It is possible to write a Functor Set instance, but it would make it useless as a set.
 But these are just "arbitrary" rules that we impose on the data structure. Here is an example of a foldable for which no functor instance can be implemented:
 data OnlyInt b where OnlyInt ::Int -> OnlyInt Int instance Foldable OnlyInt where foldMap f (OnlyInt i) = f i 
 I also see no laws for foldables that would forbid data WeirdBool a = WeirdBool a (a -> Bool) to be foldable.
 All three of these data types are foldables that aren't traversable, simply because they already fail to be functorial. What eludes me is, whether or not there are any foldable functors, that cannot have a traversable instance. If foldable+functor would be equivalent to traversable, then could you write sequenceF :: (Functor f, Foldable f, Applicative m) => f (m a) -> m (f a)? I sure as hell can't. But just because you cannot proof that equivalence in haskell doesn't mean it isn't true (I think Gödel's incompleteness theorem applies, but I only know the pop-science interpretation).
 However if they aren't equivalent, then there must be a data type that is foldable and functorial. But I have failed to find one so far...
 I think about it from time to time and would really like to know the answer. So I hope that someones knows more!

 Basically matlab / https://octave-online.net/ appears to automatically compute the multiplicative inverse of a non-regular matrix using " the minimum norm least-squares solution" described on this page: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mldivide.html 
 I want to know if emacs calc can do that or if there is a package that might help me out. 
 I know the easy answer to this solution is to use matlab or octave-online, which I've done and that works; however I'd like to use emacs for this if possible.
 If this isn't currently available it's not the end of the world. I'm just learning as I go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am using neovim with telescope fuzzy finder. And in my free time I am forcing my self to learn Emacs (purcell's emacs.d) for personal project development. And want to cultivate habit of it (my personal choice). I want to ask few question regarding how to achieve something that I am habituated to do with neovim + telescope? I am not trying to mimic but it is kind of ease of life improvement for me.
  
projectile-find-file give me that bottom split window (hope window is correct term) to search file but I am missing fuzzy search, it is regex search by default. Can I make it fuzzy?
 C-x f gives me bottom split for find-file (like directory lookup) but again it is regex, is it possible to make it fuzzy. (if doesn't work that is fine, this is kind of curiosity question)
 In above both cases, projectile-find-file and C-x f how can I open file in vertical split of horizontal split directly. For example, in neovim + telescope I fuzzy find the file and pressing C+v or C+x would give me vertical and horizontal split respectively. Is it possible to achieve something like that behavior natively? I am open to use external packages as well.
  
​
 In .emacs.d config from purcell, there are some config regarding switch-to-buffer-other-window things but I not sure about it.
 (global-set-key [remap switch-to-buffer] 'consult-buffer) (global-set-key [remap switch-to-buffer-other-window] 'consult-buffer-other-window) (global-set-key [remap switch-to-buffer-other-frame] 'consult-buffer-other-frame) (global-set-key [remap goto-line] 'consult-goto-line) 
 Any help would be great. Thank you all for reading it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every once in a while, it's nice to have each constructor of a type be distinguishable by type. When this comes up you can often work with a GADT that assigns a different tag to each constructor, and live with the pain of an existential wrapper when you don't know what constructor something will need to return. But doing this always has the cost of needing to introduce types to serve as the per-constructor tags, and I was wondering if I could do better.
 I realized that with DataKinds and PolyKinds, it was possible to refer to any constructor in the same type argument, so I decided to see what would happen if I tried it:
 {-# Language DataKinds, GADTs, StandaloneKindSignatures, PolyKinds #-} import GHC.Types type Foo :: forall k. k -> Type -> Type data Foo tag a where First :: a -> Foo 'First a Last :: Foo 'Last () 
 And, well...
 :6:23: error: • Data constructor ‘First’ cannot be used here (it is defined and used in the same recursive group) • In the first argument of ‘Foo’, namely ‘'First’ In the type ‘Foo 'First a’ In the definition of data constructor ‘First’ | 6 | First :: a -> Foo 'First a | ^^^^^^ 
 Is this restriction serving an important purpose? Could it be relaxed to some extent such that this case, at least, would succeed?

I understand the concept of mapping, functional programming, pure functions and the "case" keyword, but I don't understand why is it calling .pure[F], what it is and where is that coming from in line 36. Like, why is it not doing e.toEligibilityStatus() ? 
 Can someone give me a hand?
 I pasted the function that its being called bellow the method just so you can see it, but originally it is under a separate implicit class.

I used it a bit for school but learned nothing about how to modify it etc. Recently I installed Doom Emacs which is very cool, and then I found out about Emacs Application Framework. Unfortunately I have no idea how to install it on Doom because the guide only talks about vanilla emacs. I found a reddit thread about it which also cites a github discussion, but unfortunately I have no idea what they are talking about. I tried to do some stuff without understanding. I am not 100% sure what I did but it didn't really work and I don't even know for sure how to get everything back to where it was before I added anything and start trying again.
 It would be very appreciated if someone could help me with the installation process and tell me step by step exactly what you do and maybe why.

 I can't find any concrete information as to how to run a unit test. According to the comments in the default configuration that I used, some combination of posframe and dap-mode can be used for this, but I can't see specifically how. Specifically, if I'm editing a ScalaTest test class, I'd like to be able to run all of that tests within that class (and ideally I'd like to also be able to run an individual test within the class), and get some visual feedback as to the result.

 'kill-buffer-and-windowis bind toC-x 4 0`
  
I am quit new to Emacs 27. Searching around how to modify key bindings gives me a lot of possible solutions. The question is not how to do it but how to do it the right emacs way.
  
kill-buffer should be unbind
 'kill-buffer-and-windowshould bind toC-x k`
  
And what does happen if someone tries to "override" a key-binding (before unbinding it) or when using one keybinding for two different functions? Do I need to take care of this or does Emacs this for me?
 What I tried so far is Lisp (global-unset-key (kbd "C-x k")) (global-set-key (kbd "C-x k") 'kill-buffer-and-window)  Seems that this works. But I am not sure if it is a good way and if this has some side effects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon dear Haskell wizards of this amazing community.
 I hope I am permitted the honor to post a help request here. I am working on a little side project, likely one of my first more serious projects with Haskell that actually works and is teaching me a lot while working on it.
 This project has one purpose: to be a tool that can be installed to a Unix system, configurable with YAML, that can add, commit and push from several local repositories to remotes. 
 For example I have a knowledge base of markdown documents that I like to have synced to a private GitHub repo, and for that I had a little shell script doing it. 
 Then the idea arose in my head to create something more powerful and configurable that could do this for multiple repos. Of course I love Haskell and want to learn more, and I thought this might be a good way to roll up my sleeves and absorb a lot of knowledge in practice.
 I am sure the code I wrote is not following the best practices, I just have really given it my best with my current knowledge.
 I look forward for your opinions and recommendations. Please checkout the repo at: https://github.com/averageflow/git-autosync

One example is ADTs - beginners often wonder why they're called sum and product types; it's because of the deep connection with actual everyday arithmetic!
 In type systems we have the concept of linear and affine types to refer to functions which use their arguments exactly once, or at most once, respectively. In mathematics, there are the concepts of linear maps and affine spaces. Is there some deep reason for choosing the same name for these concepts? An analogy at least?

 If some kind soul would look at my config and let me know if I've made blues, it would be appreciated. It works but my elisp ain't that good - I want it to ignore '' buffers like \scratch* etc, but not *elfeed-search*.

 I read quite a bit more than I write and would enjoy a feature with the ergonomics such as the following: 
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/112/actionable-code-folding-in-emacs-fringe
 Has anything changed with "click-able folds" since the above question 7 years ago? 
 Just curious how folks solve this, or if I'm out of the ordinary for missing this functionality. 
 (P.S. I'm on doom emacs and was thinking about attempting to bind mouse clicks to hideshow/vimish-fold for different languages but I guessed with my elisp skills it would get unwieldy fast...) 
 Any tips appreciated, thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The emacs package in my distro has recently been updated from 27.2 (org-mode 9.4.4.) to 28.1 (org-mode 9.5.2).
 In this newer version, org-indent-mode adds a lot of vertical white space in between lines of text. I personally don't like the looks of this but more importantly it's wasting a lot of space on my already cramped laptop screen. I notice that it's not as pronounced when using other fonts but I don't want to change from Terminus.
 The screenshots are captioned with the emacs and org-mode versions and whether org-indent-mode is on or off. Note that the only change from vanilla emacs is setting the default font to Terminus.
 Is this expected behavior? If so, where would I configure this to behave the way it did in 27.2 with org-mode 9.4.4?
 Also, I'm not a fan of the way the STARTUP keyword face is so different from the rest of the buffer. Is there one variable that I can set to make org-mode use the default font everywhere? Or do I have to change each of the dozens of faces individually?

 I'm pre-announcing a major version bump to the base64 library (and subsequently the base16 and base32 libraries) that will be an overhaul of the API. As a result, it's probably best to get out ahead of things and announce it months in advance. In the last version of base64, version 0.4.2.4, a user found a rather annoying and stupid mistake that was clearly the result of fat fingering commands in my editor, and was never caught because there was no real reason to test that particular code. I got very angry at this, because the problem wasn't so much that a mistake had happened, but that if the type of the function had a more reasonable signature, it would never have been allowed to compile in the first place (haha types what are they?).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I just started a new job where I will mainly work on a DSVM (Data Science Virtual Machine), an offering from Microsoft Azure that comes with pre-installed libraries, languages and, amongst other things, emacs. However, after getting in and starting to re-create my .emacs.d I realized that it runs an old CentOS installation for which only emacs 24.3 (https://centos.pkgs.org/7/centos-x86_64/emacs-24.3-23.el7.x86_64.rpm.html) is available. Has anyone been in the same situation? I started using emacs with version 26 so I'm not sure exactly what I'll be missing (other than the fact that certain packages already doesn't install, like use-package which I rely heavily on). Is there a way to build a newer emacs on this old CentOS?
 On my local machine I have to use Windows, but I can still install Emacs 28 so I'm trying to figure out how I could run emacs locally and use TRAMP or something else to edit and ideally also run things on the DSVM. Does this sound like a reasonable workflow? I'm new to TRAMP, but am trying to figure out the setup as we speak.
 To summarize:- Can I build a newer emacs than 24.3 for CentOS 7? I assume not as otherwise someone normally would have done it already (EDIT: MIght have been too fast to post https://justyn.io/til/compile-emacs-28-on-centos-7/)
 - Are there any obvious issue with the TRAMP workflow outlined above where only emacs is installed locally, but all libraries, Python etc. are installed on the virtual machine/remote that I'm SSH-ing into? Would something simple like running a python mode w/ LSP, Flycheck etc. where all the executables are also on the virtual machine work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have previously had emacs 27 as a favorite application in gnome, with the following behavior:
 If no instance of emacs is open, clicking it opens emacs
 If an instance of emacs is open, clicking it brings the current instance to the front.
 However, with emacs 28 I notice that there are two emacs shortcuts available, one called "Emacs" and one called "Emacs (client)". 
 Neither of these replicate the previous behavior.
 The "emacs" application opens new instances of emacs each time. 
 The behavior of "Emacs (client)" is more subtle. If I have opened "Emacs" it sometimes does the right thing and focuses the existing instance, but some times it does not do anything. If no instance of emacs is open, it does open emacs but does not load doom emacs as expected.
 Is there some compiler flag somewhere that I'm missing? I never meant to enable emacsclient.

I wonder whether it would be feasible to have MS/Word as the single tool for the Zettelkasten since it is possible to write hyperlinks to connect to other Zettels (Word slips).
MS/WORD also has a tool to manage the bibliography references.
In this case, each Zettel (Word-created slips) would be filed at the Onedrive or some.
Have you analyzed this situation?

# Geistige Arbeit ist meist nur gerichtet, nicht gezielt

Tätigkeiten in komplexen Kontexten sind nicht vollständig planbar, da man nicht mit Sicherheit vorhersagen kann, was passieren wird. Entsprechend ist es nur bedingt sinnvoll, Ziele zu setzen. Es gibt Tendenzen, die man nutzen kann; Richtungen, die man einschlagen kann.

In der geistigen Arbeit sind es oftmals die unvorhergesehenen Abzweige, die Erkenntnis schaffen und so zum eigentlichen Ziel werden. [@ahrensZettelkastenPrinzipErfolgreichWissenschaftlich2017]

Plane und setz dir ruhig Ziele, aber passe diese an die Entwicklung der Gegebenheiten an. [@sertillangesLebenGeistesSein1951, 119]

Vergleiche mit der "millitärischen Mission" in [@dozReflectionsLeadershipComplexity2017, 9]

When I try to identify key terms sentence by sentence, I come up with the following list:
geistige-arbeit
planung
komplexität
zielsetzung
erkenntnis
richtung
Regardless of the general usefulness (or uselessness) of tags, is this a sensible approach or am I missing something?
I am happy for any other feedback on this Zettel as well, of course.]]></summary>

 I have made an emacs package and I would appreciate any feedback.
 Its name is text-categories located here: https://github.com/Dspil/text-categories
 Its purpose is to make debugging easier, but it might have other use cases. It essentially introduces categories for text. Each character in the buffer belongs to a category. The user can change the current category and every character inserted from then on will belong to the new category. The user can store a category which deletes all of its characters but remembers their position so they can be restored later. A category can also be completely erased. Lastly, the categories can be visualized in a separate buffer and the user can navigate through them in this buffer.
 The main thing I use it for is adding all debugging extra code into a different category. I can switch to the main category and correct the bugs and when I am done, I can erase all the extra code as it all belongs to a different category.

 To add a multi-word phrase to the abbrev list, I have to count how many words there are in it, use that number as a prefix, then do Ctl-x a +.
 I would like to modify this so I can simply highlight (I'm using evil mode) the whole phrase and hit Ctl-x a +.

I am taking a course,and I came across a problem where if i input a really large number I get ERROR - Garbage collection fails to reclaim sufficient space . I have tried a couple of things but so far i am unable to make it work.(I am using Hugs). I am not allowed to use lists or anything else that is not already in my code. ```compress :: Integer -> Integer compress n |n == 0 = 1 |((n<10)&&(n>0)) = n |otherwise =valid(calc n)
 calc :: Integer -> Integer calc num |num == 0 = 1 |((num<10)&&(num>0)) = num |otherwise = calc (check(num div 10)) * (check(num mod 10))
  When running that input the hugs interpreter -> compress (137128)  i am getting that error,but it works fine with smaller numbers. So far I have tried not to calculate everything in theotherwise``` condition but Im not successful. I need to multiply every digit of a number,and do it again with the result until the number is smaller than 10.
 Edit 1: when a digit=0 is considered as 1.
 EDIT 2 ``` valid :: Integer -> Integer valid num |num == 0 = 1 |((num <10)&&(num>0)) = num |otherwise= compress num
 check :: Integer -> Integer check num |num==0 = 1 |otherwise = num ```
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm probably going to butcher this question.
 I have a trait being used as a variant type (for a dummy interpreter) with a bunch of Conversion methods. Here's a simple example:
 ```scala sealed trait Variant
 case class Fixnum(i: Int) extends Variant case class Flonum(f: Double) extends Variant case class Str(s: String) extends Variant
 // Variant <-> Int here, figure the others exist as well... given Conversion[Int, Variant] = Fixnum(_) given Conversion[Variant, Int] = _ match case Fixnum(i) => i case Flonum(f) => f.toInt case _ => throw Exception("type err") ```
 Now, I can use the above to pass my Variant type to any function that takes an Int and it works as expected. However, what I can't seem to do is use an Int as a generic type parameter like so (shortened for clarity):
 ```scala // works fine.. def unaryIntPrim(f: Int => Variant)(xs: List[Variant]): List[Variant] = xs match case x :: xs => f(x) :: xs
 // doesn't compile.. def unaryPrim[A](f: A => Variant)(xs: List[Variant]): List[Variant] = xs match case x :: xs => f(x) :: xs ```
 I can understand why unaryPrim doesn't compile, but presumably there's a type constraint I can add to A to ensure "can be implicitly converted from a Variant" or an implicit argument I can add that ensures the conversion is possible?
 I can get rid of the compile error by matching against the type (x : A), but it warns that the type check cannot be performed at runtime, which makes me think that isn't going to work either.
 Any thoughts on how I might be able to accomplish the above would be great. Thanks!

 Each container ideally ought to act like a pure function, it has no internal state so that when these pods are restarted they can plug back into the message passing category.
 Functional programming idioms like map, reduce is recreated as distributed equivalents like MapReduce.
 By severely limiting what containers can do they are turning containers into functions. In AWS Lambda server-less movement, they literally call their construct a function.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just tested out Emacs 29 on Arch today, and the pixel-scroll-precision-mode is really quite smooth! I'm very content with it until I noticed one big problem: 
 If the scrolling doesn't stop exactly at full lines, that is, if the top of the frame is cutting the top half of some line, then as soon as the user starts editing with the cursor, the Emacs buffer will "adjust" itself such that the top of the frame is starting with a whole line, often through scrolling a few pixels up or down. This results in a visual jitter when the user is done scrolling (e.g. with the trackpad) and right after one starts using the keyboard to edit the text.
 I'm not sure if I've articulated the behavior clearly enough, but I'd love to know if others are facing the same issue, and whether there are workarounds for this. One potential solution that I could think of is to "perform the pixel adjustment" (if needed) right after the user "stops" scrolling. Because it's less distracting then than when the user starts typing.

 I am not elist hacker, but I checked there are password-store-executable, auth-source-pass-filename variables where I can overwrite some default values but can I define more than one value (or regex) for each? Pls help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things I miss from non-Haskell languages, is that when I look at the "type" of a function, the library author has named the parameters and I can see what names they chose. e.g.
 int div(int dividend, int divisor) 
 but in Haskell I get a more opaque Int -> Int -> Int. Has anyone else considered attaching names to the types of args? e.g.
 {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-} import GHC.TypeLits type (n :: Symbol) ~= a = a div' :: (Integral a) => "dividend" ~= a -> "divisor" ~= a -> a div' = div 
 Is there a cost to this beyond mild revulsion from a potential library user and a few extra strings being thrown around by GHC at compile time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a month since we've released our mobile apps for iOS and Android – with the chat core in Haskell!
 We also have just added 2 templates to create simple chat bots in Haskell that can run on any platform using the same core as SimpleX Chat:
  
A simple one, that just accepts a pure function as a parameter to write a simple REPL-like chat bot – e.g., you can try connecting to this squaring bot – it simply squares the numbers you send to it.

 Hey you, unconditional Emacser, fanatic Org user, fearless Elisp programmer,
 This post is for you :)
 We all have different needs when it comes to taking notes. Fortunately, with org-mode many workflows are possible.
 In my case, my notes consist of:
  
some pieces of text (almost no markups),
 many code snippets (inside source blocks) and,
 many, MANY links to specific places (function, variables, ...) in repositories that I cloned on my machine.
  
Today I want to talk about links.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve just finished reading the amazing book from Sönke Ahrens about “How to take Smart Notes”(1). As a visual thinker and sketchnoter my first idea was to use this method to combine visual thinking with networked thinking. Taking smart notes is great, but taking smart sketchnotes would be even greater.
To summarize the content of a book like this within one sketchnote is not that easy. So I started to summarize one main aspect witch is important for a reader of Ahrens’ book to work with the Zettelkasten method. It’s the major workflow starting with filling the inbox till using the content of the growing slip-box to produce an output of higher value. I added the tools I’m using in this process and also the page numbers from the book as a reference for further reading and understanding the underlying method.
You are also working with Obsidian and Zettelkasten? Do you see any differences between your own and the workflow described by Sönke Ahrens?

 So if anyone back then wanted to give it a shot, but couldn't because it was not easily available through package.el, I would love to also hear about your feedback.

 This post is neither a tutorial, nor am i asking for help. I just needed a platform where i could finally share my appreciation for org-mode and emacs in general as none of my peers share that fascination. 
 I'm in the process of writing my bachelor-thesis, and emacs/org-mode generally helped me a lot over the course of my studying. From software assignments using various major-modes and LSP to note-taking using org-roam, literate-programming using org-babel, version-controlling everything with magit and server administration using TRAMP. 
 Unfortunately, we have to use our University's LaTeX Template and converting the template to org would take time that i currently don't have. Otherwise, i would prefer writing everything in org-mode...
 At the very least, i can use it for literature aggregation, note-taking (org-noter) and running various statistics!
 The following screenshot shows org-mode using DoomEmacs (own configuration is on my todo list).
 I use ess and literate programming to quickly write and document various statistic functions on my database, which i can then import in LaTeX. 
 Thanks org-mode <3
 So, a big THANK YOU to everyone involved and the helpful posts I've seen on this sub. You all make my student-life way more exciting.

I ended up writing five Fantasy books by accident, that I am about to finish, and wishing to make a living of them and my future books.  That's the Terry Pratchett's story version, reality is a little more complex, but it's full of details, and it is a long story to tell. But you are not here for a story, you are here for a process.

Writing fiction has steps :
Generating new ideas
Researches for accuracy
Decision : construction (world building, story, characters…),

Why are there games in emacs by default. I just don't get it. Even if I was held at gunpoint, I wouldn't play Tetris and alike bs. I play games like Hollow Knight & Celeste and I just don't see any sane reason to implement the ability to play games in emacs. It's just plain overthetop nonsense/flair.

I'm assuming this is down to the differing strength of the two type systems but I'm still unsure. Generally, I'm just curious about the differences in modularity, code reusability and purity, polymorphism and behaviour towards IO. Thanks in advance.

E.g. ITheoretically in an Emacs config with 1,000,000 lines of code, is it simply loading an entire config into memory on startup and the resulting performance is the same?

I am a Fantasy writer and artist, my Zettelkasten helps me to make research (architecture, techniques, History, military History, sciences, engineering, religions, mythology…) and create new ideas to my novels and worldbuilding. I am passionate about art and technic as well so I make a lot of notes about technical points (is gomme arabic suitable to make an emulsion ? Is it a good approach to build up a character through my novel ?) or between artists and their style. I note my ideas of creation as well (and my brain is so much faster than my fingers). I take piece of humour as well (punchlines,  comical every day life event…). And I love medecine for some reason.
I read the forum and the website since one year or more, I don't remember, but they were really helpfull to build up my writting process and I am here a little to bring up some of my thoughts if I can add something interesting, but much more to thank you all for helping me through your texts and messages.
English is not my mother tongue, and I am quite rusted, so my writing would not be as precise or as subtle as I want to be, so I am sorry in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much like we see with NERDTree/NvimTree etc, I'm hoping to create a toggleable tree of links (hopefully configurable as an org-file) that I could then use to quickly navigate through "sections" of my emacs files collection. 
 (think Notion sidebar if you have not seen this or logseq's favourites sidebar.).
 Is there a canonical way to do this (or even a package I have not seen) to easily allow this? 
 The use case is providing the quick ability to navigate and hop to various "sections" in my org-roam (and yes, while I realize this is slightly superfluous with the ability to jump between buffers with C-x b, for some reason, I find having the sections in my face much of the time keeps me weirdly focused on my higher level concerns.).
 thanks!
 Daryl.

This Week
I'm working on a shell script for inserting part of a note's file name as a title as the note's header.
I will try and pick up my reading pace in Effective Notetaking.
This week, I'll meet with the New York Times writer Carl Zimmer as part of JAMM328.

 I am trying to create an effect, F e, that is capable of loading entities (es) from a repository and saving them.
 The repository could be anything (e.g., in-memory with Refs, a SQL/NoSQL database, Redis).
 The entity, e, should be devoid of persistance concerns. Most of our projects work with DDD, so they should devoid as much as possible of infrastructure concerns.
 Also, every F e must implement a save function, that saves the entity e.
 This save function should be dependent on e.
 So if we have a concrete F User, we must have something in scope that knows how to save this F User.
 Likewise, if we have a F (User, Dog), we must have something in scope that knows how to save these two entities, maybe even transactionally.
 I should be able to use it as such:

 However, I'm wondering if anyone has tried to compile native Haskell executables for iOS on their M1 machines. I know a lot of work has been done in the past to cross-compile Haskell code to iOS, but theoretically I imagine this should be easier on the M1 hardware, as you're at least using the same architecture on your host as you are targeting -- and yet I haven't been able to find any evidence that anyone has actually tried this, or any guides for how one might go about doing this.

 The commands are working fine, but compiling the project (running its tests) affects the value of compile-command, it sets it to the same value as projectile-project-compilation-cmd.
 Is there a setting to prevent that behaviour, as I really want to be able to do both?

 I have been using emacs with around 50 packages installed either directly or as dependencies.
 Emacs is awefully slow to start on my work laptop , around 25 seconds. Some more info :
  
1s for vanilla emacs
 8s empty init.el but with the 50 packages installed
  25 s for the full setup. 
  
The full startup on my windows potato laptop from 2014 is 2s. It is also 2s for a linux VM on the work laptop. 
 I am suspecting some windows group policy settings or antivirus settings. Anyone has faced similar performance drop ? 
 Task manager shows heavy cpu usage during the whole startup 
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm peaceful very new to Megaparsec and Haskell in general, so this is probably a very basic question. I want to write a parser for a simple DSL using Megaparsec and for this I'm following the Megaparsec tutorial here. At the beginning of the tutorial the author provides the following example for constructing a parser for the string "abc": haskell -- Parsec as defined in the library is: -- type Parsec e s a = ParsecT e s Identity a type Parser = Parsec Void Text mySequence :: Parser (Char, Char, Char) mySequence = do a <- char 'a' b <- char 'b' c <- char 'c' return (a, b, c) Here is what I'm trying to understand, char has the signature: char :: (MonadParsec e s m,‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­Token s ~ Char) => Token s -> m (Token s) see docs here. In our case m is Identity and (Token s) is Char, so char 'a' should return Identity Char and therefore the do block in mySequence should resolve to value of type Identity (Char, Char, Char), or am I missing something? My question is, how can the type of mySequence be of type Parser (Char, Char, Char) instead of Identity (Char, Char, Char)? Is this some monad transformer magic in ParsecT that allows for this? Similarly later in the tutorial the author introduces the following example using <|>: haskell pScheme :: Parser Text pScheme = string "data" <|> string "file" <|> string "ftp" <|> string "http" <|> string "https" <|> string "irc" <|> string "mailto" Same thing here, string "data" <|> string "file" has the signature: haskell <|> :: Identity Text -> Identity Text -> Identity Text So how come that it can be resolved to Parser Text and not Identity Text? Thanks a lot for your help! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I'm beginning to learn Scala via a project I got lined up in my work. I want to build SQL queries programmatically. As source I have an Excel file that I read into Databricks using Scala, e.g.
 val apoDF = spark.read .format("csv") .option("header", "true") //first line in file has headers .option("delimiter",";") .option("mode", "PERMISSIVE") .load("dbfs:/FileStore/shared_uploads/[MY_ACCOUNT]/[SOURCE_FILE].csv") apoDF.createOrReplaceTempView("apo") 
 The Excel file contains all info I need to rebuild the SQL statements, like ids, source view (string), object ids...
 So, after reading the Excel file into Databricks I get a DataFrame.
 The data I need from this file as multidimensional array would look like this:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/hmcgc5xbuar81.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b0a5bca137992544b67ca9871e2fb14a8c65c1a
 Since I'm coming from webDev / php I still think in multidimensional arrays and the concept of DataFrames is new to me.
 What is best practice? Should I build a multidimensional array first and query afterwards the data I need from it? Something tells me that this wouldn't make that much sense since all data is available already in the dataFrame?
 What I am trying right now is to localize the data I need and store in a variable, e.g.
 val uViewName = spark.sql("SELECT View_Name FROM apo WHERE Param_Id = 2869169") uViewName.show() 
 This could be packed into a function .... or method of class?
 Thanks for any advice, much appreciated!

 I am trying to emulate a (nice) resonance Calendar approach I have in Notion (and also looked at doing same with markdown and neovim), but have yet to fiund a good workflow that centralizes a stacked list of various "stuff" (books + notes + Kindle highlights from Readwise, youtube videos and notes, movies I watch, post I read etc) and then lets me write notes on it, and have it say listed in a chronological order automatically.

 It works sooo well that I think this is a dream. 
 I wondering how hard it was for Emacs team to implement this feature. I guess it may sound "gimmick" for Emacs poweruser but for me, it's very usefull, specially when scrolling long files.

 Background
 The downloads page of haskell.org suggests using ghcup and stack to obtain a toolchain. These two tools are widely used in the community, actively maintained and kept up-to-date. The page also provides a number of "alternative installation options" (see below, or on the page itself, for the list).

 Is there anything like this in emacs?
 Notable things about this screenshot (beyond the the obvious): the two viewports are synced, so if you scroll one the other scrolls. The one on the left actually has the _full_ git blame (showing the source code it's blaming) hidden off to the right. Not sure that last bit is useful. 
 This visualization of git blame works WAY better for me than anything I've found yet. I'd _love_ it if one of you would say "oh, just use ______ package to get this." ;)

 Here's an experimental package which converts a unified diff into an inline diff, collapsing changed lines into a single line where green shows the added part and reddish color shows the removed part. Here's how it looks:
 https://i.imgur.com/Jn6Tffp.png
 I made this package as an experiment to test how useful it is. Currently, it works with files under git when you compare it to the latest commited version (C-x v =), but it shouldn't be hard to make it generic. I'm just putting it here, in case someone finds this useful.

Never liked using those big IDE but, since my whole team uses VS Code, I thought to give it a go and generate the least amount of friction on the first week. Yeah, didn't like.
 BUT what I've loved was a VS Code extension named "auto doc string" which could automatically create a doc string and already place some information, like which arguments, what are the returns and, most important, type annotations were reflected in the doc string.
 Sure, there must be a package in emacs that could do all that, right? I have yet to found it. The closest I got was yasnippet-radical-snippets, but it doesn't support types (yet).
 Does anyone know a better tool for the job?

 I would like to type: M-x link TAB, and see markdown-insert-link as one of the first options in the completion list, because markdown-mode is currently active. I don't want to have to enter 'markdown', that should be inferred from the context.
 I thought that a menus commands completion could be pretty close to what I'm looking, since often menus have the most relevant commands for the active modes.
 I've found LaCarte library, that lets me execute menu-bar menu commands from the keyboard, using completion. That's pretty close to what I want, but its icycles completion is not working very well for me.
 I wonder if there other options out there? Or ideas on how to implement? (I can do some Emacs lisp).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came up with a cute method to turn a grammar into a parser, and I wondered if it was something that people have done before.
 Basically, the idea is you unfold the grammar into a set of all the trees it produces (using a data structure built with Free), and then fold this structure into a combinator parser. For the fold and unfold, I use the recursion-schemes library (which conveniently knows exactly how to unfold and fold Free structures).
 Here's the code of a simple version. In practice, I added a fancier recursion scheme (gchrono), more use of megaparsec, and a fancier grammar, but this is the core idea:

 I'm using async-shell-command instead of 'compile'-command because of reasons, I managed to enable compilation-minor-mode but it doesn't go to the first error - even if set compilation-auto-jump-to-first-error to true. Invoking (first-error) in the buffer goes to the first error though.
 Can compilation-mode/minor-mode list errors and warnings in a good readable format like flycheck does without much customization?
 
 Reasons why I am not using M-x compile: I am using xcodebuild (for iOS development), when its done I check for errors or if the build succeeded. If its succeeded it will install the binary and launch the simulator and then parse the logs. If you have a connected iPhone/iPad it will install and launch it on device and start the lldb. I wanted it to be very automatic (like Xcode)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have recently been playing around a bit with helm for my personal use and, though helm per se is absolutely great, i have found the lack of documentation to be extremely annoying. Now I get it, its open source etc. and just read the source code, but I have been unable to figure out quite a few things from the source.
 So, my first question: Can anybody point me towards some good helm documentation that is not the wiki(https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki), which is extremely lacking if you want to write your own sources instead of just using helm and that is not outdated (like this https://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/01/24/Anatomy-of-a-helm-source/).
 Then two more questions:
  
How can you do multiple columns in a helm source? For example, helm-mini shows file size,name, absolute path etc., all in different columns.
 How can you show something, but not make it searchable. Say I have a special source for various user-defined commands, and I want to provide not only the name, but also a short description of it, or its keybindings etc, without including them in the filtering, like helm-M-x does.
  
​
 EDIT:Here the answer by the current helm maintainer (I think) -> https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/discussions/2493 (Summary: Use :match-part to only match against parts of the options). Thanks a lot for the extremely fast answer. Also, there really needs to be a better helm documentation. It is such a great tool, but anything other than the most basic extensions requires you to dive into the source code/ask the maintainer, which is less than ideal, I think.

 import Data.Functor import Options.Applicative data AllParams = FirstThing FirstParams | SecondThing SecondParams data FirstParams = MkFirstParams {fooOne :: String} data SecondParams = MkSecondParams {fooTwo :: Bool, fooThree :: ()} paramP :: ParserInfo (AllParams, FilePath) paramP = info (optP <**> helper) ( fullDesc <> progDesc "Example CLI" <> header "Example CLI" ) where optP = liftA2 (,) commandsP outputPathP commandsP = hsubparser $ mconcat [ command "FirstThing" $ info (firstCommand <&> FirstThing) $ fullDesc <> progDesc "Use first with given parameters" , command "SecondThing" $ info (secondCommand <&> SecondThing) $ fullDesc <> progDesc "Use second with given parameters" ] firstCommand = MkFirstParams <$> strOption ( long "fooOne" <> metavar "String" ) secondCommand = MkSecondParams <$> option auto ( long "fooTwo" <> metavar "Bool" ) <*> option auto ( long "fooThree" <> metavar "()" ) outputPathP = strOption ( short 'o' <> metavar "FilePath" <> help "Output Path" ) 
 In general, this is pretty straightforward, AllParams is the overarching CLI type. Each constructor within designates a command subparser and its field type designates a record type containing all the options for this specific subparser.
 I'm generalizing/automating this pattern using generics-sop. The code is quite large so I'll post it in this gist.
 I'm curious whether that implementation could be simplified. By simplification, I'm mostly mean less noise. I'm curious whether there are utility functions, types and constraints provided by generics-sop already that invalidate the need for typeclasses like NSFrom and similar types I've handrolled there. I'd also be curious to know whether certain snippets could be improved in a general sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm JUST beginning to learn clock-in, clock-out. It seems to me that's great if you're always at your computer AND you have the discipline to always work in a clocked-in state. But I have many little or big tasks or projects around the house that I'll work on or complete, and I'd like to be able to add to the task an estimate of the amount of time I spent on it without using the clock-in/out system. 
 For example, today I changed my laptop battery, worked on my digital multimeter, and then checked all my batteries in my battery drawer, threw away the bad ones. I'd like to be able to just mark these tasks as DONE and also directly (and easily) add the hours worked. I might not know the exact start and end time I worked on the project, and I don't want to have to go fudge some clock-in/out time. (Unless there's a super easy way to fudge it!) I suppose it would be something like an HOURS_WORKED property.
 And I'd also like to be able to generate a report of all such activity/time for the day, for the week, for the month, etc. Ideally, that could somehow be combined with my clock report, but I'd be happy even if it were a separate report. 
 Maybe this functionality is already in clock-in/out feature set? If not, is there some package or methodology that might help me out here? (I know there is ALWAYS... SOME way for anything with org mode, of course!)

This does not occur on linux emacs installs or on windows install or on Intel mac. It does happen on brew install of emacs on M1 mac. I would love to get my normal orgmode back 
 And of course the same thing happens in -nw mode.

 I did not have any experience in coding whatsoever before university and learning about Haskell and functional programming was very exciting and eye-opening for me since it showcased a very intriguing way of thinking and reasoning. 
 I was wondering if anyone knew where I could get an internship in Haskell for this upcoming summer. Graham told me that it was kind of hard to get an internship in Haskell if I didn’t have a PhD but any help would be much appreciated :)

 To answer my question for example, I like the idea of [1..10] which will generate the list of ints quickly. I am not looking for very high level concepts like monads (which I am yet to understand), but more of these little things like [1..10] that are super convenient. Things for example you miss when using imperative languages or even other functional languages.

 I am using GNU Emacs 28.0.92 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2022-03-27 on Windows 10.
 The problem is that many (not all!!) unicode-characters in e.b. text are not printed "as they are" but instead "encoded". Certain unicodes have no issue like Umlauts, eg. ö ä ü or ß are all displayed correctly and are properly "uni-"encoded using two bytes. 
 Problem can be seen here:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/ah42nzguuyq81.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4130f7b7b3ae9bec3f6bdc324c7b3c0e2fa8418
 and with many other unicode characters.
 File encoding info is:
 U -- utf-8-dos (alias: mule-utf-8-dos cp65001-dos) UTF-8 (no signature (BOM)) Type: utf-8 (UTF-8: Emacs internal multibyte form) EOL type: CRLF This coding system encodes the following charsets: unicode 
 The file is recognized as having unicode-encoding and saves properly preserving unicode.
 ​
 ​
 It is not a font issue, if I cat or more the file in terminal using the same font, the unicode characters get properly displayed.
 It is not an issue of Windows terminal, if I start emacs -nw from cmd.exe, powershell or Git Bash it's all the same (not from within Windows terminal)
 Note, when I open the same file using the same .emacs configuration in Gui-Mode all Unicode characters display correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used Haskell for a number of coding assignments. I compiled using ghci, and did not touch cabal at all. The system I ran on was managed by someone else and was taken down. I then tried to set things up on my own system, but was forced to abandon ghci for cabal run.
 After fiddling about in the .cabal file I could get rid of most compilation errors by adding depencies, but this one eludes me:
 Main.hs:3:1: error: Could not find module ‘Control.Monad.Par’ Perhaps you meant Control.Monad.Fail (from base-4.13.0.0) Control.Monad.Fix (from base-4.13.0.0) Control.Monad.RWS (needs flag -package-key mtl-2.2.2) Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. | 3 | import Control.Monad.Par | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
 It does not provide a dependency suggestion to add to my .cabal file, and the other options seem unrelated.
 Note that Control.Monad.Par should be there since this is part of an assignment and this file was given to us by the teacher.

 I'd probably use emacs for more in the future, but after realizing how little I used I decided to steer around to vanilla emacs and wow, it's so much faster 0.0
 There's still a fe things Im working out, like how to get the status line to be more like doom's and such (Trying out mood-line right now), disable the gui menu and buttons and such, but it's working very well so far. 
 Plus color me weird, but I kinda like the lisp syntax, maybe I need to dig deeper in it. 
 Plus I got my emacs config placed into ~/.config/emacs but a lot of guides are saying I should use ~/.emacs.d does it really matter where my config is?

 Trying to find resources on how to set this up, and all the more, how to make it gracefully import into IntelliJ has taken me into blog-posts and forums going back to 2014. Am I simply missing it, or is there still no clean solution for this?
 I would prefer not to use a boilerplate, since it would be nice to know how to set this up de-novo, there are quite a lot of moving parts. Does anyone have any current resources on the matter?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, The Archive generates Zettel IDs that are not strictly compliant with with the latest ISO 8601 standard.  According to Wikipedia, since 2019 the ISO 8601 standard requires a "T" to be present between the date and time sections.  It would be great if ISO 8601 compliant Zettel IDs could be incorporated into a future release, preferably as a predefined native option.
I figure, if one is going to use a date and time stamp as an ID (and I can see the benefits of doing so), then the ID may as well be strictly ISO 8601 compliant.
I realise this is pedantic, not massively important, and can easily solved by other means (TextExpander, etc.).  It'd just be a nice touch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, r/haskell,
 We have been working on Chameleon: an interactive type-level debugging tool for Haskell. In 2020 I crowded sourced feedback and ideas on the designing Chameleon on Reddit. As a result, I was overwhelmed by a generous amount of participation and lots of constructive feedback from the wholesome r/haskell community. This time we are running an extended study with more advanced interactive features of Chameleon.
 If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming tool research or checking out our Haskell type-level interactive tools, please click this link to proceed https://blend.ercu.be/consent. We use telemetrics to gather usage data for this study, but it is totally anonymous. We won't ask you for personal data (email, name, phone number, etc.). It will take you about 20 - 30 minutes to complete. But in turn, it will help us immensely.
 If you are interested in this research, there're links to the paper and video at ICFP 2021. You can also check out our repository on Github.
 Thank you,
 Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team

 Does anyone know of a package or a way to get minibuffer to look like this? I mean, the position of it to be somewhere else, not necessarily docked at the bottom?

 I have a program that someone else has written. If I run in from the python shell then it works fine. But afterwards that python shell is useless, it won't respond to inputs. (Simple scripts don't suffer from this problem.)
 Why am I asking about this here? It doesn't do this outside of Emacs. If start a python shell from a Windows cmd window then the python shell continues working after the program has ended.

 Actually, that release was made a couple of weeks ago and today we just released 0.20.0 which added the possibility to use raw interpolation inside the cypher queries.

First note
Second note
Then, if Luhmann wanted to insert a note in the system, he'd append a letter running from "a":
First note
Second note
Now, what happens, if Luhmann wanted to insert another new note between note 1 and 1a?  I'm assuming I have misunderstood how his system works, but I can't see what label the new note can be given as there's nothing that can now come before "1a".  Can anyone clarify?]]></summary>

 Is this possible using footnotes? I didn't find an option to set the target location of the footnotes section, or a way to group them per (sub)section.
 I could use internal links instead, using ^{[[note1]]} in the table and a list of notes 1. <<note>> some note below the table, but this doesn't give backlinks. (I suppose I could manually add a link in the other direction but sounds like a lot of effort, while using footnotes is very simple.)

 I'm trying to setup emacs to edit and compile verilog sources remotely. I'm using TRAMP to do this. Editing files runs great, but I don't know how to setup the compile commands to run the verilog parser remotely using emacs compile. Emacs tries to compile it locally.
 -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: "/ssh:user@odcvde:/slowfs/265/users/user/FM_Debugging_Hard_Verifications/hv_labs/lab5/rtl/" -*- Compilation started at Thu Mar 31 16:02:33 /bin/sh: line 2: /ssh:user@odcvde:vlogan: No such file or directory 
 It disobeys also the default shell using sh instead of bash
 Also, misc stuff, I'm having problems with TRAMP and the bash prompt. It initially have problems to detect the prompt, It had bold characters, so I worked around it adding * to the prompt regexp and worked again, but I noticed that there's still some garbage in the shell. Is forcing certain terminal type or changing the prompt a more "robust" solution? 
 Thanks

I have come to like Emacs so much, that I want to take it with me everywhere I go. However, my work uses Windows and won't allow me to install any software so I can run my favorite program from a flash drive with this method:

 Anyone else have a neat portable Emacs setup? I can always use new ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Spacemacs with the Twilight-bright theme, as I like how it uses the background colour in highlights.
 When I run Emacs directly via X, everything works fine but, when I try to use it on a terminal, in some cases the minibuffer text shows the same colour as the background (white), so I can't see anything. One of the examples is trying to open a file in a project with C-x C-f, the minibuffer seems to show the same as the selection in Helm (judging on how the cursor shows at the same location as in the Helm window and it changes when I move up and down) but I can't see what's there.
 It seems to work fine for things like showing me function details from LSP.
 I've looked at the twilight-bright.el and I've not found anything.
 Note: I've been doing some more testing and it looks like the issue is not only related to twilight-bright, but it seems to be related to spacemacs itself.
 The issue happens both, on terminals with white on black and black on white.
 Anybody got any ideas on how to fix this issue or other themes to try?

 Is this expected?
 Can I not restrict the profiling to just my own code?
 Is this a one time thing or will it happen for every new Cabal project?
 I guess the newly installed packages include ways for the RTS to get detailed information from every module, does this add any overhead for a program running without profiling?

A WebAssembly module as an executable
Let’s first clarify why we can treat a WebAssembly module as an
executable file.

 Example: when mousing over a return type annotation (underlined with red to suggest an error) it says:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading the "async" article from FPComplete (https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/library/async/), at the end of the article it gives a "final exercise: implement mapConcurrently using mapConcurrently_".
 According to documentation (https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-13.21/unliftio-0.2.10/UnliftIO-Async.html), the signature of mapConcurrently is as follows:
 mapConcurrently :: MonadUnliftIO m => Traversable t => (a -> m b) -> t a -> m (t b)
 I've implemented mapConcurrently for lists (as a special case of Traversable), so the question is how do I generalize my solution to cover all traversables.
 Is there a way to create a Traversable without knowing its concrete type? I think I'd need to add another typeclass as a constraint, but changing function's type doesn't seem right.
 Also I'm curious about other ways to implement mapConcurrently using mapConcurrently_.
 ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arrows seem like a really useful concept – any time you need to be able to inspect a graph of operations, like to cache operations done repeatedly or to convert them to run on the GPU etc. Normally, all you can get is an opaque function that you can't inspect, but as I understand it with arrows you can decompose the function and decide yourself how to execute it. This means that you can set up things like parsers combinators that can be "viewed" as an abstract grammar, in addition to a parser.
 (An issue of course is that, when using arrows, you can't use the outputs of an arrow to determine what effects to imply. If you could, it would mean you can't statically analyze which effects are going to be dispatched. To do that would mean introducing "higher order arrows" aka ArrowApply, which i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SWAR (SIMD in register) techniques were used in the last release of jsoniter-scala to speed up parsing and serialization on JVM platforms.
 VarHandles from Java 11+ gave access to byte arrays for loading 64-bit values of subsequent 8 bytes and storing 8/4/2-byte values.
 It allowed saving on load/store ops and parallel processing of bytes of JSON input/output. Also, it mitigates redundant index checks when storing bytes to byte arrays sequentially in GraalVM CE.
 Results of benchmarks from Intel® Core™ i9-11900H are here as usually.
 BTW, If you had a positive experience with the library that saved your time due to handy derivation, reduced compilation time of your project due to efficiency of derivation macros, or reduced your spending on infrastructure due to efficient parsing and serialization, then please support its development and testing on different platforms by:
  
sponsoring my account on GitHub
 
mentioning jsoniter-scala in articles and video records
 
sending your feedback to Gitter chat or GitHub issues

But that is labor intensive, and it makes me delay that administrative task. I'd rather just be able to pick them up directly in emacs as to do items in a file or even just headings in a file would be fine. Or even just single lines in a file I guess.
 Well now that I think about it, I suppose this isn't really an emacs question, but this was the first place I thought of asking since I figured others may have wanted to do this as well, and might have some solutions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using markdown-mode and have the following custom keybinds:
  
C-b puts **|** (| is the cursor), so that the text is bold
 C-i puts *|* so that the text is italic
  
The problem is that I often get in this kind of situation: ( | represents the cursor) 
  
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, **consectetur adipiscing |** elit, sed do eiusmod 
  
When I type something between the asterisks I always leave an appending whitespace inside, before getting out of the enclosing asterisks. 
 One solution could be to interpret a double space as "get out of the enclosing asterisks". This way, if I type another space in the example above, this would be the result:
  
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, **consectetur adipiscing**| elit, sed do eiusmod
  
I'd like this to be possible even for backticks. However, it doesn't seem like an easy task (I'm not a elisp expert, but i could make it through its particular syntax). Is there some hint or already built tool out there that could help me? Thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a challenge problem on the kattis website called Pivot that has a concise solution using a bit of reverse state. Since forward state is needed as well, it's a natural fit for the Tardis monad
 The sample list is:
  
2 1 3 4 7 5 6 8
  
At each element we're to determine if it's greater than the elements before (prior state) and less than the elements remaining (future state). With tardis you can do both at once:
 check :: Int -> Tardis Int Int Bool check num = do modifyForwards (`max` num) modifyBackwards (`min` num) p <- getPast f <- getFuture pure $ p <= num && num < f -- this is a pivot if it's between the prior -- maximum and the future minimum

They said the salary I want is for seniors and the max I can get is ~€50k.
 Do you have any trustable salary sources? The most I found are published by recruiter companies and I think they tend to say a bit more than it would be realistic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, r/orgmode!
 Since citations in orgmode are now native (hurray!), I've come to wonder whether it is possible to use the same document as the source for the citations.
 Via org-babel blocks it is possible to write a bibliography in orgmode and tangle it to a bib-file. This mechanism is sufficient if you decide to use only one or two org documents for literature summaries, reading lists etc. like Gregory Stein does. But it becomes unwieldy, if you want to use a single file per book/article with self-contained bibliographic information, because you have to create a lot of single bibliographies, that clutter up the org-folder.
 The selfcontainment of bibliographic information seems very attractive for me because single files can be shared without thinking about needed supplementary files. Further, it would be possible to copy bibliographic entries between files and create project-specific bib-files for LaTeX use, without having a huge bibfile, of which the most part stays unused, and still have a consistent bib-key.
 As far as I can see Nicolas Rougier's org-bib-mode doesn't do that, but uses a corresponding bib-file.
 Do you know ways to achieve that or do you think it's a rather stupid idea, that brings a lot of hassle with it?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: New example of using Servant with Okapi here. If anything, I think Okapi could make a nice prototyping tool for getting something out the door quickly. Read more about how to embed Okapi apps into Servant here.
 Hello Community,
 Over the past few weeks I've been working on a new server-side microframework called Okapi (I'm open to name suggestions).
 Okapi is a monadic parser, but for HTTP requests. It's inspired by F#'s Giraffe and the simplicity of web frameworks in other programming languages like Python and Ruby. It's meant to be a simple, idiomatic alternative to other frameworks in the Haskell ecosystem. A summary of what Okapi is can be found here.
 If you're interested in testing Okapi out, take a look at the documentation. I recommend going through the crash course (still finishing it) to get a feel for what you can do with this library.
 To see an example of what a web server built with Okapi looks like, take a look at this implementation of the realworld backend spec. You can use it to compare it to other implementations of the same spec. The Okapi implementation passes all the required tests and is a good idea of what you can expect from the framework.
 Okapi is still in the early experimental stage, so I would highly recommend NOT to use it for production projects or important side projects. The API is subject to major changes. The main reason why I want to show Okapi to the community this early in its' development is to get feedback as soon as possible to make sure this is something worth investing more time into. I'd love to hear opinions from Haskellers and non-Haskellers of all skill levels and backgrounds.
 If you'd like to open an issue or PR, the repo is here. Contributions are more than welcome.

 I know this is lazy but I want one that works out of the box for "text editing, programming", also really interested in EWW and the email apps. Are there any existing distro that are closest to the functionality I want? I want to tinker as least as possible. But willing to nonetheless. Just don't want to do It if there are existing configuration already. 
 Not sure if distro is the correct term, if not please correct me!

 Even better, IMHO would be something akin to how git command work. Namely, by simply having a script on your path named git-*, that script is interpreted as a sub command. So git-stuff would allow git stuff. A similar mechanism in cabal might allow us to experiment with new commands without having to modify cabal itself, not entirely unlike how extensions allow us to experiment with new Haskell features in GHC.

 I tried to make TRAMP work before ending up here, but i just could not TRAMP + LSP working.
 It occurred to me that maybe there would be a way to run an emacs server on the instance and have some kind of a thin client locally. I messed around with forwarding the server socket over ssh, but it turns out that emacsclient will just try and get the server to do stuff on its end. In other words, emacsclient is just an RPC call, not a thin client.
 X forwarding is way too slow.
 Anyone got any other ideas?
 if it wasn't clear - I want emacs running on my server, with a GUI on my laptop.
 I'm envisioning something like a web app - backend <=> frontend

The Zettelkasten is my conversation partner in the process of constructing a draft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a stupd issue where I cannot override view-mode-map keys for some reason.
 The code I want to use is below. F13 binding is working but the others aren't.  (setq view-read-only t) (global-set-key (kbd "<f13>") 'view-mode) (with-eval-after-load 'view-mode (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "f") #'forward-char) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "n") #'next-line) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "p") #'previous-line)) 
 If I remove the with-eval-after-load and just add the following
  (setq view-read-only t) (global-set-key (kbd "<f13>") 'view-mode) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "f") #'forward-char) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "n") #'next-line) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "p") #'previous-line)) 
 Then I get: Symbol's value as variable is void: view-mode-map.
 I'm still a noob so I might be overlooking something really simple here, any help, please? Thanks in advanced!
 EDIT: forgot to mention that it that if I go to my init file and eval-region on the define-key lines after Emacs loads, it works just fine. I’m also overriding other maps like dired and some others in a similar way and they also work fine.
 EDIT 2: I am trying to replicate this https://gist.github.com/ivan-krukov/63a586f2121519ca51b201c634402a84 but without use-package.

 Can I have emacs trigger a command when I type a specific string in insert mode*? In my use-case I would like my citations keys to become auto-completed somehow when I type '@'.
 '@' is the prefix for citation and references in pandocs markdown. Citation look like '@Nurmagomedov2020' for example, and they are stored in a bibtex file. I currently search and add citations by calling citar-insert-citation, which provides an interface to search my bibtex file and prefix the '@' symbol so that is recognised by pandoc, when I create a document.
 Using completion plugins clearly it is possible for typed text to trigger a function (the completion). Is there a way I can make this work for my citation entry? Alternatively, is there an alternative approach for my specific use case that someone has already implemented?
 Any guidance appreciated, even just a link in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From this discussion, /u/github-alphapapa suggests the possibility of adding the following to the org-mode-hook:
 (when (s-prefix? (expand-file-name "~/org/") (buffer-file-name (current-buffer)) ) (real-auto-save-mode) ) 
 The provides the feature of limiting the real-auto-save-mode to his ~/org/ directory. I'd like to do this (or something similar), but my current cut-and-paste level of elisp knowledge certainly wouldn't work:
 (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (when (s-prefix? (expand-file-name "~/org/") (buffer-file-name (current-buffer))) (real-auto-save-mode)) ) 
 How would I add that functionality to my org-mode-hook?
 Also, what if I might want to extend that to also include some additional arbitrary file or dir? In particular, I might want to add my ~/.emacs.d/init.el, but maybe something else as well!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
First post here!
I am newer to trying out note-taking within the set up the Archive and the Method as proposed on this website.
As I’m seeking to prioritize connections at the beginning, I’m seeing different opportunities. However, I’m finding it difficult in the prose. This makes establishing the connections difficult.
For example, today I was reading about deliberate  practice and how immediate feedback is necessary within the practice session. I thought about how I can make a connection to other notes within the archive. I had another note about failure as a teacher that came from my readings on Toyota and their leadership practices. However, I didn’t know a good way to write out a good connection.
If it would help for me to post the contents of those notes in here I’d be happy to.
Any thoughts on how to do this naturally?]]></summary>

 do you have or know about a windows build where the new cairo support is working well ?
 I like the github: "emacs-build" releases but I'm maybe a lazy and I wouldn't like to built a new one by me or ...

 Is there a way to create a named function, and then use something like an org link to execute the function?
 Specific Use Case
 I have a list of items that serve as the basis for my weekly and monthly reviews. The review document is bullet list with short prompts and links to other files. (e.g., research, notes, agenda, goals, etc).
 However I'm using perspective.el to separate my project management, research and creative work into separate window collections. I would like to add a link that takes me into the relevant perspective rather than simply loading the file or buffer into the current perspective with an org-link.
 If this was webdev, I could add a JavaScript click handler. Is there a simple way to accomplish this without new key-bindings?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a small package textsize to automatically adjust text size when the display changes (mentioned earlier)
 It automatically calculates and applies a point size to the frame's default face, based on monitor size and pixel pitch. I find it invaluable as I switch between a large 4k desk monitor and the laptop when mobile, and presenting on big screens in meeting rooms.
 I just added it to MELPA, and converted it to a minor mode, so anyone already using it will have to tweak config to change (textsize-setup) to (textsize-mode).
 I'd be very happy to hear about issues or desired features (here or on Github). I don't encounter displays that don't report size, but presumably projectors are not reliable for this - is there good generic metadata I could use to detect and compensate for them? At worst I could add overrides by EDID (unique display identifier).
 Also, while the default parameters I came up with work for me, there are many display geometries I just haven't encountered that may be sub-optimal with the defaults(?).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/emacs, long time Vim user here trying to make the switch to Emacs and get it to stick (this time). And one of the recommendations I've seen when it comes to successfully switching is to figure out your emacs workflow and patterns rather than trying to shove Vim into Emacs (evil-mode aside).
 One of the core parts of my Vim workflow was fuzzy finding a file (any file, anywhere) in a project. And I see that there's a way to get similar functionality with projectile or project.el. The problem I've found is on large projects it's too slow, and breaks my focus. But this got me thinking. I very rarely need to jump between many far flung regions of the project I'm working on. And actually, having to search through all files in the project (as quick as it may be) gets annoying in my Vim workflow where there are many files with the same or similar names. 
 So instead, what I'm imagining would work well for me is to fuzzy search for all files in a sub directory of a project. I.e: in executing a custom project-find-file I would first get the option to find a subdir in the project, and then it would operate as regular project-find-file from that subdir.
 Being new to emacs/elisp are there any pointers for how to do this, I would imagine ideally with project.el? Or alternatively, how do you deal with navigating to files quickly (without breaking your focus/flow) in large projects with emacs?
 Thanks in advance! 🙏

 Here is an example of how to use Generically1 to derive an instance:
 type Foo :: Type -> Type data Foo a = Foo [a] a (Int -> Int -> Maybe a) deriving stock Generic1 deriving (Functor, Applicative) via Generically1 Foo 
 While this derives a specific instance it is by no means unique. By the magic of Applicative every such instance has a backwards instance via Backwards (Generically1 Foo) where the applicative effects run in reverse order.
 Generically1 works for a lot of Applicatives but it does not work for sum types. Right off the bat this excludes lists, ZipLists, NonEmpty-lists…]]></summary>

 As per https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Saving-Emacs-Sessions.html#Saving-Emacs-Sessions, 
  
The file in which Emacs saves the desktop is locked while the session runs, to avoid inadvertently overwriting it from another Emacs session. That lock is normally removed when Emacs exits, but if Emacs or your system crashes, the lock stays, and when you restart Emacs, it will by default ask you whether to use the locked desktop file. 
  
So I expected emacs to just load as normal. Why did it open loaddefs.el? And what is that file?

Now that I've finally gotten comfortable with Org Mode, I decided to spend a week writing down a tutorial for new people. This is the tutorial that I wished I had found when I was starting out trying to make sense of all this. 
 I've written a very detailed explanation of my workflow and various Org Mode configurations. It includes screenshots as well as code samples with comments. Please take a look at it and let me know how I can better refine it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a new Haskell book being published by No Starch Press called Functional Programming for Physics Geeks which just recently went into early access. The book is the culmination of the author's decades of experience teaching computational physics using functional programming and it covers Newtonian mechanics and electromagnetism all in Haskell, with emphasis on using strong static typing and compositionality to implement the core ideas of kinematics and dynamics. The author also has a library of code used in the book on Hackage here.
 Personally I love books using Haskell in application areas that are outside the field of software engineering, like van Eijck and Unger's Computational Semantics with Functional Programming, so I am very much looking forward to this book and I thought others might be too. Relive the horrors of undergrad physics, but this time in Haskell!
 I know that the author has written about using Haskell to teach physics before and has been working on this book for a while so maybe people have seen it before but didn't know it was slated to come out this year. The page for the book had been live for a little bit last year but then it disappeared. However it seems to be back up now because early access for the book has opened. The last time I talked to the author he said the goal date for publication was in May, but it seems to be pushed back to October this year.
 (NB I'm not involved in any way with the book, I'm just excited for it and hadn't seen it mentioned yet.)

 I love Diagrams and Gloss libraries in haskell. I wanted to try making something that will enable anyone/me to use it in other programming languages for quick scripts – for drawing simple geometric shapes and animations.
 mindra talks via stdin/stdout, so integrating with it should be easy. So far I have one client library (https://github.com/rorokimdim/mindra-clj) for Clojure.
 I’m at the beginner level in haskell. I’d appreciate any kind of feedback (either on mindra or the haskell code in general). Thanks for reading!

 While encrypting individual headers or entire files is fine and all, I find it rather cumbersome when trying to write something that isn't meant to be entirely encrypted and still structurally have it make sense. With org-mode being hierarchical and all, I can't really just make another heading and then go back to the parent header at some arbitrary point. From what I've understood, adding new babel blocks is rather easy, but I'm not sure if it'd be easy or hard to implement something like this for org crypt. I think it'd be nice to have though.

 Does anyone know of any other articles on API breakage and deprecation cycle policies, in Haskell or any other language? It would be great to collect them together so we can learn from them and reduce the costs of change on Haskell users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is a very open question about emacs workflow with remote work. I’m sharing my thoughts here because I’m stuck and am looking for some useful ideas. It’s more like a very long mumble that you can respond to. There will be no right answers, and please let me know what you think of each of the ideas here!
 Background: I do a lot of machine learning and data analysis, which means I have to use python and R on remote servers a lot. I’ve been trying to find a good workflow from my laptop in emacs. 
 These servers usually have very different dependencies from my laptop since they have GPUs. For example, pytorch, a machine learning learning library, uses different versions for machines with and without GPU. This makes direct sharing of virtual environments or poetry projects difficult.

Last Week
More reading and onboarding "Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson." This is filled with rich material and I'm taking my time.
I'm most excited about the development of a proximity search tool! Having this as a Keyboard Maestro macro is making it useful. Easier and more beautiful searches for interconnecting ideas in my ZK.
This Week
Restarted going to the public gym.
Reorg backpacking gear in prep for this year. First trip in 2 weeks.
Continued onboarding to my ZK "Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson."

 EDIT2: reading the documentation I can install globally with global-undo-tree, but does not look to work properly to me, I open an org file with undo-tree-visualize and says that is not enabled undo tree
 ---------
 I use emacs doom from a mac, starting it with emacs -nw (inside the tab), as I have a really compact keyboard sometimes I press shortcuts I am not aware of, and often the terminal I have been working get closed and I lose all the data I was working on.
 I saw on the internet I can use `recover-file` but there are not trace of my previous changes, I lost already hours of data dozens of times in few months of org usage. Also when I use c-x u or even worse just U, then something can go wrong with redo and also I lose data. This never happen in intellij or inserting data in excel or other basic ide. Please do you know a plugin can save me from that, if things keep going as that I have to renounce to use org mode for important info, and I do not want that.

 optionally:
 you can try out gccemacs which has native compilation 
 if you are on any linux distro
 ​
 https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GccEmacs
 ​
 General advice:
 ​
 set the value of gcmh-high-cons-threshold to a suitable value of
 your choice do not set it to very high values as it will
 not have any performance gains acorrding to the below post.
 minimum value if you are an lsp user "100000000".
 ​
 https://bling.github.io/blog/2016/01/18/why-are-you-changing-gc-cons-threshold/
 ​
 Also do not set the value of gc-cons-threshold value in lsp package
 :config option as this value is set automatically by gcmh package
 ​
 never turn your back again to emacs. emacs is awesome!!! :)
 ​
 NOTE:
 ​
 The above post is not to cause fights or to raise any political agendas.
 This is just an opinion and help by myside to any user struggling with
 emacs performance issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had originally posted this on r/spacemacs, but someone mentioned that it might be better addressed here. Thanks in advance for any thoughts!
 ***
 I've been using Spacemacs for a month or so and am really enjoying the experience. I originally wanted to learn Emacs because of Org-Mode, but have since started doing most of my writing in a markdown buffer using writeroom-mode, where I previously just wrote with Vim in a terminal.
 I'm using a standard US keyboard on a 2013 Macbook Pro (still going strong), but I use ä ü ö ß all the time. The situation is basically exactly what is outlined in this older post. I have had the same key combinations baked into my fingers for years and I'd like to keep it that way. Right now, I have this in my user-config:
 (setq ns-alternate-modifier 'none
 ns-right-alternate-modifier 'meta)
 It works wonderfully, all good, I thought. But now at some point the umlauts go haywire: for example, ä eventually becomes \303\244 and I'm not sure what could be triggering the change or how to fix it. I get that it's UTF-8, but why it ends up like that in the first place is beyond me. Is there an obvious fix here or something that I'm missing? Thanks in advance for any input.
 UPDATE: 
 The link that u/graduale posted ended up being super helpful, as it was indeed some sort of encoding issue having something to do with the existence of the "null-bytes" as discussed in that thread. Found them with C-s C-q C-SPC, got rid of them and using revert-buffer-with-coding-system cleaned everything up after I selected the encoding. And the change seems to be holding after restarting emacs completely as well. Thanks for the help!

 Setting it to nil makes vterm as snappy as any other external emulators I've used.
 Does anybody know why it's set to 0.1 by default? Prevent performance issues?

 For example, given an org-mode table like this:
 |-----+-----+-----| | Foo | Bar | Baz | |-----+-----+-----| | Y | N | abc | | N | Y | def | | Y | N | ghi | |-----+-----+-----| 
 I'd like to count how many "Y" are in each column, to create this result:
 |-----+-----+-----| | Foo | Bar | Baz | |-----+-----+-----| | Y | N | abc | | N | Y | def | | Y | N | ghi | |-----+-----+-----| | 2 | 1 | 0 | |-----+-----+-----| 
 As a bonus, it'd be nice to be able to determine what percentage of the total number of lines in the table (excluding the header, result lines, and separators) contain "Y", resulting in:
 |-----+-----+-----| | Foo | Bar | Baz | |-----+-----+-----| | Y | N | abc | | N | Y | def | | Y | N | ghi | |-----+-----+-----| | 2 | 1 | 0 | | 67 | 33 | 0 | |-----+-----+-----| 
 Of course, this should work with any number of rows and columns.

 Here is another post for an unofficial Copilot plugin named flight-attendant.el. It seems no longer maintained, so I wrote a new one, additionally supporting up-to-date Copilot client, accepting completion and better integration with company-mode.
 The plugin is still under development, and I only tested its compatibility under Linux + Spacemacs.
 Since it's my very first elisp project, any tips or advice are welcome, thank you!

 Hey all,
 flymake-swi-prolog is an Emacs package implementing a simple Flymake backend for SWI-Prolog, it provides diagnostics about Prolog source code in prolog-mode buffers.
 Here's how it may look when you write some code that makes no sense:
 flymake-swi-prolog
 This is the first Emacs package I've authored, I use Emacs a lot but I haven't written a lot of Elisp outside of my config file before, so the implementation is mostly based on the example backend from the Flymake manual. Any comments or suggestions are welcome!
 Under the hood, flymake-swi-prolog uses diagnostics.pl, which is a tiny Prolog package I've written to expose the diagnosis performed by the SWI-Prolog built-in IDE in a way that is both human-readable and easy enough for me to consume from Elisp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Zettlers,
does anyone speak (write and read) Sanskrit? If yes, how does it feel compared to English or other languages you speak?
I am asking because I think about learning Sanskrit to improve my thinking.
Example: To me, German is very sensitive compared to English. In German, tiny differences in wording make a huge difference in meaning and tone. English is much more simple.
A (translated) quote that is very telling:

  
French is a noble park, Italian a big, bright and colourful wood. But German is more like a primeval forest, as thick and mysterious, as lacking big trails and yet full of hidden paths. You can’t get lost in a park, and not that easily and dangerously in the Italian wood’s brightness; but in German can disappear in the thicket within four, five minutes. Because the paths are so difficult to follow, most try to march as straight as possible through it. Actually, this is against it’s against the nature of this language. Sure, it has a principal direction, but yet invites by hundred trails and hidden paths left and right to depart from it, and soon back to it.



I butchered the quote through translation because it makes heavy use of the peculiarities of the German language.
That is the reason why translations from German into English are very difficult.
That is the reason why I plan to provide my own translation of the core texts of Luhmann in some distant future.
Live long and prosper
