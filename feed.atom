        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One day, I tried to reflect on why I don't really like EasyMotion-like packages (Avy, Ace-Jump, etc.). It was because they feel too intrusive to my flow - I want to go to a place almost mechanically, without thinking like, "So I need to go to this 'f' symbol, I should type 'f', then wait, read, and type the next symbols one after another" 
 So, I tried to create a package that works the opposite way—you always go to the same place with the same keybindings. E.g., if you type M-s f u p, then you will always be in the top right corner.
 It might be slower at the start, but probably more mechanical, faster, and freeing your head in the end. 
 I wrote an example package and a training game, only to find out later that there exists the package I wanted, but which does it on a system level :) And it is https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd/

 But still want to share my training game - maybe it would be useful :) https://github.com/haukot/dead-eye-jump

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 At work we use 2 indentation styles:
 void shortFunction(int arg1, int arg2, // ..., int argN, int argM) { // ... } void SomeClass::AndAnotherInnerScope::veryLongFunctionNameJustForFun( SomeOtherVeryLongTypeName<MaybeEvenWithTemplate> arg1, int arg2, std::string arg3, ) { // ... } 
 Default tree-sitter indent rules can't cope with that. They weally want to align all arguments to an opening brace, turning second function declaration into a mess.
 I have written my own indentation rule, maybe ugly, but it get the job done.
 It tries to indent first argument by 4 spaces if it is on its own line, and doesn't move it at all otherwise, and everything else is aligned to it.
 (defun lazy/smart-indent (node parent bol &rest _) (let ((first-real-child (treesit-node-child parent 1))) (if (or (not node) (treesit-node-eq node first-real-child)) (save-excursion (goto-char (treesit-node-start parent)) (back-to-indentation) (+ (point) 4)) (treesit-node-start first-real-child)))) 
 Then I had to create my own c-ts indentation style where I changed 2 rules: for argument lists and parameter lists to this:
 ((parent-is "argument_list") lazy/smart-indent 0) ((parent-is "parameter_list") lazy/smart-indent 0) 
 I don't know a good way to do it other than copy existingy styles and patch in place.
 Hope it helps someone.

 I can't seem to figure out how to use MonadError here. Im new to scala and dont understand the syntax that well.
 Edit:
 I tried doing this
 class LiveVendors[F[_]] private ( xa: Transactor[F] )(implicit ME: MonadError[F, String]) 
 But Im getting No given instance of type cats.MonadError[F, String] was found for parameter ME of constructor LiveVendors in class LiveVendors in the apply method

 Has anyone experienced this bug with poly-org and org-mode 9.7? 
 https://github.com/polymode/poly-org/issues/49
 I see the issue when the buffer glitches from top to bottom, with the cursor moving line by line too fast. It's basically unworkable at this state. 
 My solution is to stay in 9.6 until there is a permanent solution for it. 
 Best.

 This post is not specific to Scala but I like this community so I ask it here.
 What do you think makes more sense for testing API status code and messages returned to the client? Unit testing (and mocking your services)?
 Or Integration testing to test with the real system?
 Thanks!

Since most of the time I'm on very large monitors, I have the base font size set to be readable there, though sometimes I'm on the laptop and need it to scale down a little bit.
 I've done some searching for solutions but seems like the only ones I've come up with are from EmacsWiki (zoom-frm.el). This is fine, but also seems like it requires a lot of additional packages, also from EmacsWiki. 
 Anyone ever tried these solutions? I can go searching through EmacsWiki for all the dependencies and download them if I need to, but the Git repo is absolutely gigantic to try to get small amounts of packages so a bit of a pain. But if they're the miracle cure, I'll do what it takes.
 Also open to other packages that do the job. Just would like to control the text when the laptop is hooked up to dock with big monitors, and when it's just a laptop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The following settings help me compile my LaTeX documents via C-c C-c, and synctex works quite well with Skim on MacOS, with one exception. The LaTeX document compiles fine only when compiling from the root directory.
 Typically I have a main file acting as the "scaffolding" that imports various chapters/sections in separate files.
 main.tex └── sections ├── chapter-1.tex └── chapter-2.tex 
 Everything works as expected only if I compile from a buffer open with main.tex, but not with any of the chapter files in the sections directory.
  (use-package latex-mode :init (setq TeX-view-program-selection '((output-pdf "PDF Viewer")) TeX-view-program-list `(("PDF Viewer" ,(concat "/Applications/Skim.app" "/Contents" "/SharedSupport/displayline" " -b -g %n %o %b")))) :hook (LaTeX-mode . auto-fill-mode) (LaTeX-mode . variable-pitch-mode) (LaTeX-mode . tex-source-correlate-mode) (LaTeX-mode . reftex-mode) (LaTeX-mode . visual-line-mode) (LaTeX-mode .

 In main.tex, I have the following at the end of the document.
  %%% Local Variables: %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-master: t %%% End:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm running pretty recent Emacs 29.3 PGTK build, with Org 9.7.4 and pdf-tools 1.1.0
 When exporting an org file as PDF with preview, Emacs creates a new window showing the PDF correctly but also switches the current org-mode buffer to show the same PDF file, as show in this screencast recording.
 It also seems to create a new frame showing the PDF if current frame is "too small", which is not an issue for me.
 What annoys me is something switches the org-mode buffer to the PDF viewing buffer.
 I do not have `display-buffer-alist` rules regarding pdf-tools buffers.
 Have any of you seen this before?

 I have ADHD and it is a struggle to clean up my tasks or rather doing them, I mean I love how I can capture any idea and any to-do for a given project, but doing them ... that is a whole other story. 
 I recently read about how gamification can help people with instant feedback problems, to better work if their tasks are gamified. So my question is, is there a way in emacs, to implement like a point system for tasks, like when im capturing a to-do, give it an value or link the prio of the task to points and at the end of the month, get like a highscore or somehting?
 I was just wondering, if anyone did something like this and can help someone out who is really in need of something like this :D
 Thank you all, and a happy day to you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs Community!,
 I heavily use org-mode src blocks, normally with the ob-shell extension (sh, bash...), I previously worked in a MacOS system where the installation is a little complex, but can be done. Now, I recently got the opportunity to change systems so, I did.
 In a new Debian 12 installation, I have my Emacs installation and, when testing Src code blocks with *:async*, I noticed that my Emacs was still being blocked. This is a fresh installation.
 What I did:
 Run a src code block from the documentation that worked on the MacOS system, but didn't in the Debian. Async should put an ID and then replace it:
  
+begin_src bash :session execute-asynchronously :async yes
 echo "Execute session blocks in the background"
 sleep 20
 echo "Using the :async header"
 +end_src
  
What happened:
  
In MacOS, an ID is put in the results, Emacs doesn't get worked and after the 20 seconds I get the result. Works perfectly.
 
In Debian, Emacs gets blocked, with the message 'Executing Bash code block at position 480'.
 
 Things I've tried:
  
Emacs -Q for a minimal example, same issue.
 
Searched for the ob-async github, nothing related and, no 'requirements' I may have missed, or packages.
 
Searched the web for answers, apparently, this is not an issue that I can find logs about, and given that I am in a new installation, I'm at a loss at what else to check... 
 
 At this point, I'm not sure what do debug, since usage of src code blocks is a must and, the support of Emacs in Linux should be better as I understand, for example, I don't have issues with gpg in Debian, while I couldn't configure it on MacOS.
 Thanks!

I'd like to use org roam dailies to track my body weight, some measurements, my workout lifts, and possibly progress photos sporadically as well. Org roam dailies stores information in a one-file-per-day system where each file is named after the date. I'm comfortable with the templating required to make information entry quick and easy in this system, and have already been tracking all of this on pen and paper for over a year. Organizing and inputting this information is something I've already figured out for myself. I can get somewhat close-ish to the functionality I'm looking for with org-ql, but can't quite get the feedback I'd like displayed the way I want. Ideally, I'd like to be able to make line charts of certain tagged entries in the daily file and plot them over time. Certain things will not be in every single entry. I'm sure there's a way to accomplish this, I have not found the right plugin yet.
 Has anyone here ever used emacs to analyze information this way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to define a custom coding system for PETSCII, that currently uses a custom font with the appropriate symbols in a Unicode Private Use Block #xE000-#xE100. Eventually I'll switch to the Symbols for Legacy Computing block, but for now...
 Finding useful documentation (or even code samples) for creating coding systems has been difficult - any pointers greatly appreciated. At present, the code below 1) decodes the PETSCII properly, but only 7-bits. Characters >#x7F do not get translated. 2) Does not encode properly at all. Everything below #x7F gets translated to #x20 on writing.
 I'm being overly-explicit with some of this code, so excuse the verbosity. I did not include the entirety of 'petscii-unicode-map' here for brevity, but it's just a one-to-one mapping (and I'm hard-coding un-printable symbols ATM):
 (defvar petscii-unicode-map '((#x0 . #xE41D) (#x1 . #xE41D) (#x2 . #xE41D) (#x3 . #xE41D) [...] (#x3C . #xE03C) (#x3D . #xE03D) (#x3E . #xE03E) (#x3F . #xE03F) (#x40 . #xE000) (#x41 . #xE001) (#x42 . #xE002) (#x43 . #xE003) [...] (#xFC . #xE07C) (#xFD . #xE07D) (#xFE . #xE07E) (#xFF . #xE07F))) 
 Then I define a charset (which seems to work), an encode and decode translation-table, then the coding-system itself.
 (define-charset 'petscii-standard "PETSCII coding" :dimension 1 :code-space [0 255] :map (seq-into (flatten-list petscii-unicode-map) 'vector)) (defvar petscii-decode-table (make-translation-table petscii-unicode-map)) (defvar petscii-encode-table (make-translation-table (mapcar (lambda (v) (cons (cdr v) (car v))) petscii-unicode-map))) (define-coding-system 'standard-petscii "PETSCII coding system" :mnemonic ?P :coding-type 'charset :eol-type 'mac :ascii-compatible-p nil :charset-list 'petscii-standard :decode-translation-table petscii-decode-table :encode-translation-table petscii-encode-table) 
 Any help is greatly appreciated. I've dug through mule-conf.el and a few other bits of existing elisp, to no avail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to announce a new release of csound-expression on hackage. The CE is a music framework for haskell with focus on ease of use and feature rich as it rides on top of the powerful audio programming language Csound. It is a DSL to build Csound programs. So the library embeds Csound in Haskell. 
 It's a bug fix release. Many algorithms in the low-level renderer csound-expression-dynamic were rewritten and fixed. In the previous version unforunately there were severe bugs in effectful expressions and in if-then-else blocks. But now they are fixed. 
 Also I've updated the library to include new Csound opcodes (audio processing units from 6.18 version).
 Happy music making with Haskell!
 About the future of the csound-expression:
 I've started the implementation of more tiny csound-core package. It offers a missing layer of low-level building of type-safe Csound expressions. In the previous version I've created lots of abstractions to make music making more pleasant for FP style. But this layering makes it kind of hard to debug rendered code. So I'd like to create a tiny imperative style core that will allow me to debug produced Csound code. And the rest of the code should be expressed in terms of this library. I'm not there yet. I've built the core library and it turned out very well. But now I need to rewrite FP abstractions on top of it. I'm not there yet. But I hope that gradually I will make it. 
 Also I plan to deprecate GUI features as FLTK was deprecated in Csound and it's not packaged with Csound anymore. I think maybe it would be better to substitute them with JS+OSC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted a week or so ago about a problem with consult-register-load. I get this error when using consult-register-load or consult-register-save. Both of these functions work but they do not display the little mini buffer info with the preview and the optional do what you mean stuff that makes consult-register so great.
 Error running timer: (void-function nil) register-read-with-preview-traditional: Non-character input-event 
 This morning I took another swing at working on tracking down this bug. I put together a basic init.el file and ran emacs with -q -l test.el. Then I used M-x package-install-file. Directed it to the consult folder my regular emacs init file uses and found that consult-register-load works flawlessly. So I can eliminate the possibility that this was a bug in consult conflicting with the fact that I'm running emacs 30 or that emacs 30 it self had an issue.
 On the emacs wiki page about timers this line jumped out at me. Seems clear that it is the heart of my problem but I don't know what to do to try and isolate or resolve it.
  
This predicate function returns non-nil if object is a timer.
  
I don't know enough elisp to understand what that means. I'm also confused by what is going on in consult-register.el. Without a deeper understanding of what the offending functions in consult-register.el are doing. I don't know how to proceed. Could someone explain it for me? Any tips on debugging this? Any and all suggestions welcome.
 Full emacs config.

Is it required by another crucial package?

use M-& git ls-files -z | xargs -0 -- ls -ld followed by M-x dired-virtual RET. The latter requires the dired-x library to be loaded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[org-transclusion-http is an extension for org-transclusion that lets you transclude content over HTTP. If you have pandoc installed on your system, org-transclusion will convert HTML documents to Org format and transclude them. It handles link anchors ("fragments") in HTML as well as Org mode documents.
 After installing org-transclusion-http, run M-x org-transclusion-add-all in an org-mode buffer containing the following text:
 # Transclude ~org-mode~ document #+transclude: [[https://ushin.org/software.org#emacs]] # Transclude HTML document #+transclude: [[https://ushin.org/software.html#emacs]] 
 If you are connected to the internet and you have pandoc installed, the contents of those two files should asynchronously load, and the section of each document which matches the #emacs tag will be displayed in place of each #+transclude: link.
 org-transclusion-http is now available on NonGNU ELPA, so you can try it out on Emacs 28+ by running M-x package-refresh-contents then M-x package-install RET org-transclusion-http!

In each hode-mode buffer, there will be some text, and parts of that text will correspond to objects in a TypeDB database. It will need to keep track of (among other things, surely) those correspondences.
 This means I'll have to things in memory that are invisible to the user. The only kind of state I've manipulated previously in Emacs is the text itself.
 The only idea I've come up with so far is to define some global variables starting with "hode-state-", and hope a user doesn't clobber those names.
 Is that how it's done?
 [1] It will use Emacs as a frontend to a TypeDB database, allowing users to maintain personal knowledge bases, like org-roam but with more structure.

 [edit]
 Here is a screen video capture for those who want to see more in practice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUsgmQjMB6Q
 Some details about what I'm doing and shortcuts:
 00:00 : navigating and editing trees and list using navigation commands : https://orgmode.org/manual/Motion.html cycling (also works for src blocks) https://orgmode.org/manual/Global-and-local-cycling.html structure editing : https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Editing.html 00:16 : adding src block : C- s then type desired language (bash, python, ...) 01:00 : entering a src block editing mode, C-' then launching python console C-p and select desired code, then send it to console with C-r 01:17 : save and quit src block editing C-' 01:44 : add time stamp, C-u C-u C-c . 01:50 : cycle through todo-keywords C-c C-t 
 There are tons of other features that I don't show, of course. I.e, embedding src block results and plots directly in org mode, jupyter-like style; isolating (sub)tree in buffer; tangle block code; calendar and time alerts; ... I'm far from exploiting the full potential of orgmode. But bit by bit, it progresses. I would say I usually learn (or rediscover ) one or two new shortcuts/feature a week, on average.
 Being able to I-search a keyword in my whole work is probably one of the most time saving feature of working in a single file. I can easily copy and look up for some code or notes I've written already.

I have half a year to prepare to that and to be honest I've been avoiding this as the plague because I find Scala utterly complicated. I'll dearly miss the simplicity of Go with errors as values and everything being async IO by default.
 My first question is: if you had to move from Go to Scala how it was your journey?
 Second, do you need to deal with exceptions everywhere like in Java doing Scala FP? And, how can I know which function will/can throw an exception? For example, in Scala is pretty normal to consume Java libraries, how can I know if I need to put a try/catch?

No highlighting or echo area information when hovering over stuff
 The autocomplete is weirdly sluggish 
 If something is lsp-renamed in a .ts file, the changes are not reflected in .svelte files, and vice versa
  
On the other hand, the typescript server is snappy and seems to work as expected, so now I suspect something may be amiss with the svelte server, and/or the lsp integration.
 The problem persists with the following simple config:
 (setq-default package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")) load-prefer-newer t) (setq-default use-package-always-ensure t) (require 'use-package) (use-package typescript-mode) (use-package web-mode :mode (("\\.html\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.svelte\\'" . svelte-mode)) :config (define-derived-mode svelte-mode web-mode "Svelte") (setq web-mode-engines-alist '(("svelte" .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a reliable way to set the weight of the default and italic faces dynamically?
 This isn't working:
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :weight 'light) 
 I tried with various fonts including Iosevka and Fira Code. I can set the font to "Light" using the "Options | Set Default Font" menu option. I want to do it in elisp though, to auto-toggle between light and regular depending on whether I'm using a dark or a light theme. (A lighter weight can look nicer with dark themes.)
 Curiously setting it to a bold weight does work. In one case the font I tried didn't even have a bold weight, but Emacs synthesized it. Which is cool, but I can't set it to a light weight using elisp.
 I tried using the :fontattribute and building a font spec string manually, but it was inconsistent. Sometimes it would take effect, other times not, and I couldn't set the italicface to light and italic.

To solve my problem I wanted to slightly change my workflow:
Another concern of mine is about the "granularity" of a structure note. Eg. I have a structure note about philosophy that contains lots of zettels, and I want to subdivide it. Should I subdivide it for book, author or topic? I tend to have a topic-first approach, but maybe a book-first or an author-first approach could provide a simpler structure.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow Emacs users!
 I’ve been working on a Bash script to simplify running Emacs and Emacsclient, and I wanted to share it with you all. Whether you’re frequently starting and stopping Emacs servers or switching between different profiles, this script can save you time and streamline your workflow.
 Here’s what it does:
  
Start an Emacs server with a specified profile or initialization directory.
 Run Emacsclient in terminal or GUI mode based on provided arguments.
 Kill running Emacs servers easily.
 List available Emacs server socket files.
  
How to use it:
 (assuming you added the script to your path)
 Help Message:
 ec -h 
 Displays the usage message with all available options.
 Script Version:
 ec -v 
 Shows the script version.
 Start Emacs Server with Profile:
 ec -p my-profile 
 Starts the Emacs server with the specified profile.
 Start Emacs Server with Init Directory:
 ec -i /path/to/init-directory 
 Starts the Emacs server with the specified initialization directory.
 Run Emacsclient in Terminal Mode:
 ec -nw 
 Opens Emacsclient in terminal mode.
 Kill Emacs Server:
 ec -k 
 Kills the Emacs server processes.
 List Socket Files:
 ec -l 
 Lists the available socket files for Emacs servers.
 EmacsClient Options are supported
 All the regular emacsclient options are supported, so you can for example specify a different server to run it, for example:
 Create an emacs server in org mode
 emacs --bg-daemon=demo-server --init-directory ~/init-directory/testing-org-config 
 use ec to open emacsclient with daemon named demo-server on line 23 of a file
 ec -s demo-server +23 ~/my-file.org

 I'm trying to define a complex workflow where:
 I get My Github Issues
 #+name: gitlabGetIssuesAssignedToMe
 #+begin_src sh
 curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: ${GitlabPersonalAccessToken}" "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/issues?scope=assigned_to_me"
 #+end_src
 I get a specific Issue via iid.
 #+name: getIssue
 #+begin_src sh :stdin gitlabGetIssuesAssignedToMe() :var iid=""
 jq --arg iid $iid '.[] | select(.iid == ($iid | tonumber))'
 #+end_src
 I get the description of a specific one via iid too
 #+name: getIssueDescription
 #+begin_src sh :stdin getIssue(iid="2495")
 jq '.description'
 #+end_src
 The problem is that, while this is working:
 +call: getIssue(iid="2495")
 This is not working, as I'm still seeing the results of 2495 as in the getIssueDescription definition, I have "2495" still.

 I have also tried to put just iid so that I pass it, but no luck.
 So in this case, I want to change the variable of a chain of functions. I'm still trying but, haven't found how...
 Thanks for looking into this specific issue!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, has anyone had success using `eglot-workspace-configuration` in a `.dir-locals.el` to pass configuration to Microsoft's PyRight LSP? Am I doing something wrong below or is this not supported by either eglot or pyright?
 I am experienced with directory local variables and elisp, but beginner in pyright and eglot although I have read docs for both.
 ./foo.py:
 import sys import sys print(sys.argv) 
 ./.dir-locals.el:
 ((nil . ((eglot-workspace-configuration . (:python (:reportDuplicateImport t)))))) 
 `M-x eglot-show-workspace-configuration` output:
 { "python": { "reportDuplicateImport": true } } 
 In this simple case I expect the duplicate `import sys` in the python file to be flagged, but it is not, thus pyright is not using the config. It did use the config and flag the expected python line when I tried using the "pyrightconfig.json" file mentioned in pyright docs. So pyrightconfig.json file works, but in this case I want to use eglot-workspace-configuration. In fact I would like to use a hybrid of both (ie pyrightconfig.json checked into shared repo, and eglot-workspace-configuration on my local machine). Any tips? Thanks.

As readers and reviewers, we have all been irritated, be it a bit or a lot, by not being able to find easily a key definition that was given sometimes hundred pages before (in a PhD thesis for instance). Using the knowledge package, every use of a concept becomes one click away from its definition (in the electronic version of the document), and an index with all its occurrences can be easily maintained (for the printed version of the document). The longer is the document, the more it improves the reader's experience, but it already helps in conference papers.


A draft book written with the knowledge package is My First Category Theory Textbook by Ralph Sarkis.
Zettelkasten.de forum members might find the package particularly helpful for $(\LaTeX)$ mathematics documents, but mathematics isn't the only application.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying out this new 'pattern' for giving a typed interface on top of Akka actors. Here's an example using classic untyped actors (based on https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/actors.html):
 import akka.actor.Actor class MyActor extends Actor { private var num = 0 def receive = { case "incr" => num += 1 case "decr" => num -= 1 case "get" => sender() ! num } } object MyActor { trait Trait { def incr: Unit def decr: Unit def get: Future[Int] } class Client(ref: ActorRef) extends Trait { import akka.pattern.ask override def incr: Unit = ref ! "incr" override def decr: Unit = ref ! "decr" override def get: Future[Int] = (ref ? "get").mapTo[Int] } } 
 This is inspired by the Erlang/Elixir style of having modules with a 'client' portion that wraps the actor's 'protocol' ie the messages that it sends or receives, in a normal class with normal methods. This 'client' class in Scala can also implement an interface which can be used by callers to abstract away the 'implementation detail' of being an actor under the hood.
 val myActorClient = new MyActor.Client(ref) myActorClient.incr myActorClient.decr myActorClient.get.map(println)

 I've been playing with FP libraries in Python and JavaScript.
 Because those languages do error handling with their native try catch mechanisms, most of the code I could see that make use of those FP library looks like the following.
 Isn't it strange to mix both try/catch and the Either monad?
 I get it. It allows us to keep a full FP error handling core and logic.
 But the function implementations still make use of try catch. There are obviously no way around it.
 Those libraries can be used as FP wrappers.
 I guess the same applies in Scala when using Java libraries.
 What are you thoughts about it?

 flash.nvim do other cool stuff like selecting a function or an expression by using treesitter (i really don't know how it works really), like you would trigger the plugin in another way and then you will see characters suggestions to where to jump or select.

 Is there a way to write a function where every time I paste something, it increments the number for me? Optionally, does something like this already exist?
 p.s.: I have a snippet where I can increment the number under point, but that means navigating to the number and invoking that function. I would rather keep pasting the snippet and have the correct number show up. Probably a global counter which gets incremented on paste.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started using Emacs 6 months ago and I love it! I use it for everything, from keeping notes, scheduling tasks to keeping bookmarks.
 Recently, after reading an article on using Emacs as a password manager through auth-info and epa packages, I started to implement it in my own workflow. 
 I wonder if this is seen as a security risk for some reason. I know Emacs is open source and packages are open source but there are many packages one uses and it is not possible to audit everything even if you knew Elisp to that extent (which I don't). I am not using some obscure code but lots of some rather well known packages mainly related to org.
 I am somewhat worried that if I use epa package and decrypt some stuff in Emacs that there will be a small posibility that one of tens of packages is spying on me and may see the decrypted data. It seems like a case of paranoia to me but I'm curious to what your thoughts on this are.

 I'm using doom emacs config, with Emacs 29.1
 I have successfully enabled treesitter for typescript/tsx, javascript, and rust, so I don't think it's my treesitter config...
 Switching from go-mode to go-ts-mode drops syntax higlighting, but all of the other aspects of treesit mode, like treesit-explore-mode work. Interestingly, nil is highlighted in my .go files, but nothing else is.
 I know that typescript/tsx have a known bug that requires downgrading to a specific version, but I don't know how anyone discovered that bug so that I can replicate and perhaps downgrade go as well.
 I'm pretty new to emacs, and have only really started scratching the surface of how to customize it to my liking, so tips on how to debug would also be super helpful!
 treesit config:
 (setq treesit-language-source-alist '((go "https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-go") (gomod "https://github.com/camdencheek/tree-sitter-go-mod"))) (setq treesit-font-lock-level 4) 
 maybe relevant go config?:
 (setq lsp-go-use-gofumpt t) (eval-after-load 'flycheck '(add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-golangci-lint-setup)) (add-hook! 'go-mode-hook (which-function-mode 1) (flycheck-select-checker 'golangci-lint) (add-hook! 'before-save-hook #'lsp-format-buffer t t) (add-hook! 'before-save-hook #'lsp-organize-imports t t)) 
 Let me know if there's anything else I can include that might be screwing with treesitter :)

 What i want is, to use ansible-language-server in yaml files and have ansible-lint hints, but no automatic formating. I'm trying to make this work with lsp-mode or eglot. I prefer lsp-mode for the breadcrumbs and how it's configured, but if i get what i want out of eglot, that's fine too.
 First of all, i remap yaml to yaml-ts-mode
 (use-package yaml-mode :mode ("\\.yml\\'" . yaml-ts-mode) ("\\.[0-9][0-9][0-9]\\'" . yaml-ts-mode) ("\\.[0-9][0-9]\\'" . yaml-ts-mode) ("\\.[0-9]\\'" . yaml-ts-mode) )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there, I'm trying to setup emacs in daemon mode so it works in like a "monopoly" mode so I only have 1 window at a time always. However, in wayland it doesn't seem to work. Here's an example 
 ``` ❯ swaymsg -t get_tree | jq -r '.. | select(.app_id? == "emacs") | .app_id | ascii_downcase ' emacs
 ❯ la /run/user/1000/emacs/server srwx------ 1 iamkarlson iamkarlson 0 Jun 13 08:59 /run/user/1000/emacs/server
 ❯ swaymsg -t get_tree | jq -r '.. | select(.app_id? == "emacs") | .app_id | ascii_downcase ' emacs emacs
 ❯ la /run/user/1000/emacs/server srwx------ 1 iamkarlson iamkarlson 0 Jun 13 08:59 /run/user/1000/emacs/server ```
 As you can see before I ran emacsclient there was already existing emacs frame. According to the help:  -r, --reuse-frame Create a new frame if none exists, otherwise use the current Emacs frame 
 What am I doing wrong? Why emacsclient cannot reuse the frame?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be honest, I don't know why only now, after years of using Emacs, I have realized that I have never attempted to figure this out, in many regards, quite important feature of any text editor.
 I want to find a good, predictable way to jump between places. Not just within a single buffer or same window - between windows, tabs and frames. 
 So this is what I want:
  
I would be typing something in one buffer (matter of fact I'm typing this very message in an Emacs buffer), let's call it t1/w1/b1, okay?
 
Then I would move the cursor to the top of the buffer, to fix a mistake.
 
Then for whatever reason I would switch to another window, right next to my current window&buffer - let's call it t1/w2/b2, and then type some other stuff.
 
Then, I would switch to another tab (I'm using tab-bar-mode) where it finds t2/w1/b1
 
 Now, is there a way to:
  
Pressing a key to jump to the previous tab, window, and buffer? So in my case pressing the key would take me first to t1/w2/b2, pressing it again to t1/w1/b1 at the top of b1, and then if I press again - to the end of it.
 
Seeing and using the jumps history in the minibuffer.
 
 Is there a good package that works this way? Emacs has powerful position system, how is something like this is not a thing? Or maybe I just don't know about it yet? 
 Doom Emacs uses better-jumper, but it works within a single window or buffer, it can't take you across different windows, tabs and frames. And because of that, it feels super unpredictable, I never know where better-jumper-jump-backward would take me next.
 There are Evil marks and built-in Emacs markers, but they also don't seem to have cross-window-tab-frame functionality.
 What is you recommendation for this problem?

This post might seem unnecessary to alot of u and i agree but when u experience the pain of many years of terrible docs for different technologies u truly learn to appreciate this stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: any quick and dirty way to say… convert this org buffer with eMacs faces into the html equivalent? (In terms of look). I’m tempted to just share screenshots but would lose links and people would think me mad.
 —-
 I’m exporting to html because I’ve failed at setting up pdf export on my Mac. I use code blocks to get something like a breakout text block… but all white space seems to get eaten and it just gets very “wall of text”. And the text blocks are full screen/scale but the text wraps at my eMacs width. 
 Can I get it to just export a look like the eMacs faces? Italics get broken in quote boxes. Newlines without an extra line get wrapped into a wall. Etc etc, I’m sure we’re all familiar with this. 
 I eventually want to learn how to format correctly and get it all working… but I don’t want to delay sharing my doc for the week that will probably take me to figure out. ;)
 Any pro tips appreciated. Is html just the wrong way and I need to bite the LaTex bullet? It was crazy how funky it seemed to be to get it going. 
 Thanks.

 After testing, it seem that i can chain multiple binary operations, and each time it will use both the output of the chain, and the initial input:
  (+)=<<(+)=<<(*)=<<(*5) $ 2 == 2*5*2+2+2 == 24 
 What kind of monad is used here? The only types involved are Nums and afaik Num isnt a monad. I suspect that its the ((->) a) monad but i dont know its name so i cant research it, plus no links in Control.Monad for it.

 It is my first post here, and i want to introduce the devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge project! This feature brings auto-completion to your Emacs setup within development containers, using the powerful lsp-bridge.
 What is it?
 The devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge automates the setup of language servers supported by lsp-bridge inside your devcontainers. By using Nix packages, it ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, making it easier than ever to get started with Emacs and language servers in a containerized development environment.
 Key Features:
  
Auto-completion in devcontainer
 Support for multiple languages
  
Check out the repository for more details.

 My talk "Functional Programming: Failed Successfully" from LambdaConf 2024 is now published online.
 This is my attempt to understand why functional languages are not popular despite their excellence. The talk's other title is "Haskell Superiority Paradox."
 Beware, the talk is spicy and, I hope, thought-provoking.
 I'll be happy to have a productive discussion on the subject!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep noticing that some Emacs users seem to not be familiar with keyboard macros, and even those that are familiar with them aren't always familiar with the fact that there's a counter facility associated with them so you can do things like giving every #define in a block of C code a distinct associated value or what have you in a few keystrokes.
 Multiple cursors are sometimes the right tool, but some of the things people do with them are probably better done with keyboard macros. If you don't know about them, you should.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using straight.el I installed the newest version of org-mode from the tecosaur repo and I also installed pdf-tools. Whenever I tried viewing a pdf for the first time, I would get a void variable error for org-format-latex-header. Even though this is declared as an obsolte variable in org-compat.el, its replacement is not defined at the time the pdf is opened. I am not sure what is the canonical way to solve this. Should I just (require 'org-latex-preview) in my init.el or is there a cleaner approach like passing some parameter to use-package?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs Community!,
 I've going around my head and investigating as for a way to finally implement all my email setup in Emacs, which is:
  
3 Gmail accounts that I can implement with .authinfo and application passwords
 
2 Gmail account that I can't
 
1 Microsoft Exchange account where I can't use app passwords and, when configuring davmail, I needed authorization (actually asking for it)
 
 My problem is the latter two, where in case I got lucky and manage to fight my case and get my app password in the Exchange one, I would still will be unable to use the 2 Gmail accounts that don't have application passwords activated.
 I could configure Davmail for exchange, now, not sure about the other two gmail accounts... I think davmail only works for Microsoft.
 Is there, perhaps something like davmail that I can use across all of my accounts?, since application passwords aren't considered secure, in the case these are eliminated, I wouldn't want my accounts to stop working...
 How complicated would be to implement this? (elisp developer), is there perhaps a protocol that is not implemented in Emacs?, something like ouath2 which I think has a package. How technically complicated is this and, how much would it take?. Or is there perhaps, a different more updated way that I don't know of?.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running EMACS 29.3, I get the messaage package cl is deprecated on start (been going on for a while--it was deprecated in 28 or 27, IIRC). I believe this is associated with the [simplenote2](https://github.com/alpha22jp/simplenote2.el) package. I use one of it's functions (creating a note), I get the message format: Symbol’s function definition is void: math-fixnum. If I create a note on the browser, I can edit it in EMACS to my heart's content. I just can't make a new one. 
 My suspicion, as I said, is it's related to the cl package. I was going to try to dig into the code to see if there is a fix, but I wanted to ask before digging into that: is there some standard fix/best practice/shim that can be applied to fix this?

I think many of my notes are more of mini-essays rather than individual zettels. If so, how would I turn this into individual zettels? How do I know how far to break something down and when does it get too much? Sometimes I feel like every sentence could be turned into a zettel.
Side note: I use links instead of tags for categorization - not sure if I love this method but it's whats been working for a bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work on a lot of parallel features in the same very large git repo, so I've been making use of git worktrees and treating each worktree as a separate projectile project. Usually the worktree is named ~/reponame/feature_im_working_on. 
 However, because the repo is so big, and because the build cache takes so long to initialize, I don't want to create a new worktree every time I start a new feature. mv'ing the worktree unfortunately breaks the build cache, for reasons of stupid build system that's out of my control. What I'd really like to do is have ~/reponame.real/a ~/reponame.real/b ... and symlink those to ~/reponame/my_feature. But projectile and project.el notice that its a symlink and name the project ~/reponame.real/a. I've been looking for a way to prevent this behavior, and just use the symlink as the project name, and I haven't found it. Has anyone else done something like this with their workflow? Or do I need to hack the project.el source and add this?

 One area I wish could be smarter is completions. I use corfu and cape; I would love it if Eshell were super smart about completing commands, sub-commands (like with git), control flags, etc. I have some configuration around this, but I'm not happy with it.
 How do you configure Eshell and your completion-at-point mechanisms to be as smart as possible?

 I am trying to establish a LaTeX workflow, and ideally would like to use pdf-tools (or something similar) because well, everything works that way all within emacs. However, the rendered pdf doesn't feel quite snappy and fast as a standard pdf viewer like Zathura or even firefox's pdf viewer.
 Is this a known issue with pdf-tools, or is there something that I would have to change in the config to make it work seamlessly with emacs and auctex?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been away from emacs for a while but am helping a user get access to a package archive (melpa) and the only way out is through an authenticating proxy. I found a discussion on stackoverflow suggesting a config like this: (setq url-proxy-services '(("no_proxy" . "\(localhost\|10.*\)") ("http" . "proxy.com:8080") ("https" . "proxy.com:8080")))
 (setq url-http-proxy-basic-auth-storage (list (list "proxy.com:8080" (cons "Input your LDAP UID !" (base64-encode-string "LOGIN:PASSWORD"))))) 
 (I can find similar examples elsewhere also)
 ... the url-proxy-services seems to work, as I can see the request hit the proxy. But the url-http-proxy-basic-auth-storage seems to not work, as the proxy logs include a DENY with "Authentication required", and when I look at the traffic with the request to the proxy, it doesn't include any authentication.
 Has anyone had any success getting this working? It's emacs 27.2 on OpenSuSE.
 Thanks

 Think of "region/State" field, they are of course fixed (at least in the short term) but different on each country. I can see two different ways to handle it:
  
Manually change the file with the enum, simple
 
Keep them on a database and use set to generate the code automatically, cam make people nervous with this self-modifying code thing
 
 What would be the preferred approach in Scala?

I want to try out Ecukes, but it doesn't seem too compatible with Borg. Whenever I try to run 'eask install-deps', it gives the error "Package not installable 'ecukes'; make sure the package archive (source) is included". I managed to trace the error to the following function in eask in lisp/_prepare.el:
 (defun eask-package-installable-p (pkg) "Return non-nil if package (PKG) is installable." (assq (eask-intern pkg) package-archive-contents)) 
 Since I use Borg, I don't appear to be setting the variable package-archive-contents. What would be the right way to go about solving this issue?

 More generally, what is the easiest way to use Parsec when the input is a list of a Token type instead of a list of Char?

 These auto suggestions/completions are very annoying. I don't understand emacs enough (yet). How would I disable these? In the future, how could I go about looking for help about visual elements like this from within emacs?
 Screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/8V8MOs7
 Edit for more info:
 I did think it was coming from the company package so I have it commented out and still the completions continue to show. Here's my init.el snippet: https://imgur.com/CmKvnD0, and here's the output of M-x describe-mode which shows that company is active: https://imgur.com/a/m1c407M (this is after doom sync, full restart of emacs)
 Apparently M-x company-mode toggles it and then the suggestions go away, but that only seems like a local change. Could you help me understand what is happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've finished reading Learn You a Haskell and I'm currently following a tutorial on monad transformers I found online. The exercise is implementing MaybeT.
 The author makes MaybeT an instance of MonadTrans as follows:
 instance MonadTrans MaybeT where lift = MaybeT . (liftM Just) 
 I'm a little confused initially, so I open my code editor and get the type annotation for lift, which makes it clear instantly: it takes a value in the base monad to produce a value in the transformed monad, with that same base and Maybe as a precursor.
 So I implement it on my own:
 lift :: (Monad m) => m a -> MaybeT m a lift x = MaybeT $ do x' <- x return $ Just x' 
 My code editor suggests a refactoring here, which I end up agreeing with:
 lift x = MaybeT $ do Just <$> x 
 And then the thought occurs to me that lift could be implemented generally, like so:
 lift x = MonadT $ do return <$> x 
 But then the author asks, as an exercise: why is it that the lift function has to be defined separately for each monad, whereas liftM can be defined in a universal way?
 So I know I must've gotten something wrong somewhere here; but where exactly? Is it that using return makes sense in the context of Maybe, but it doesn't in some other monad?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The math symbols are (way) smaller than the default font.
 Recently, I've been fighting with org-pretty-entities to customize some behaviors. My latest endeavor is "why the UTF-8 character for math symbol are so small compared to the default font?". FYI, this happens in org-mode and LaTeX-mode.
 When looking into the characters itself, some clues I've gathered:
  
the faces applied are font-latex-math-face and font-latex-sedate-face. Unfortunately, changing the height in any of those cause other parts to be comically large (math-face is also applied to the rest of the math block, sedate-face is applied to any latex command like \underbar).
 
the font used to display those characters is mac-ct:-*-Apple Symbols-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 despite my default supporting it (both mono and variable pitch are nerd font).
 
 Right now I am mostly suspecting the issue is the font that is being applied, but I am not sure how to fix it. Even when using (set-face-attribute 'font-latex-math-face nil :family "NotoSans Nerd Font"), it keeps using the aforementioned font.
 Actually, the describe-char gives me the following info (some kinda of character composition? Not really that expert in Emacs):
 display: composed to form "\alpha" (see below) Composed with the following character(s) "alpha" by the rule: (?α) The component character(s) are displayed by these fonts (glyph codes): α: mac-ct:-*-Apple Symbols-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#xA1E) 
 Any help would be appreciated.

 I like to keep my non built-in package count very, very, lean. I understand that there are probably some practical benefits to using these programming language specific modes but I just don't like the idea of picking a package for every programming language, learning all the complexities of each of them, and using LSP, and using tree-sitter. It just seems like a lot.
 I also don't know how to autmatically enable LSP and tree-sitter when editing certain file types without hooking into these modes.
 I'm very new and just looking for some Emacs wisdom. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please skip this reading, it's just a message about me and Emacs.
 I was ready to write a rant.
 Then I gave up and started to breathe and think.
 I've been an Emacs user for a couple of years and have learned a lot but I'm still pretty dissatisfied.
 But dissatisfied with what? Not about Emacs. Not about the packages I use. The truth is that I'm dissatisfied with myself using Emacs, mostly because I'm lazy, that's the sad truth. Emacs is not for lazy people like me. Emacs is a demanding teacher. It requires you to be focused, focused and disciplined. So I decided to completely change my approach. I stopped compulsively trying any piece of package I found on Reddit. I decided to read and study Lisp, starting from the basics, the commands and the basic architecture.
 My frustration is driven by my ignorance. Above all.
 Emacs isn't for me when I think I can find a baked solution on satckoverflow.
 Emacs is not for me if I expect to have every package well documented in detail.
 Emacs isn't for me when I think one package can solve all my problems.
 Emacs is not for me if I think Emacs can organize chaos in my head.
 But I also found the main problem in Emacs: it causes dependency.
 Once you try it you can't stop using it, you can't stop thinking about it, you can't stop trying to find new solutions. Learning Emacs must be done in an organized and programmatic manner.
 I'm not a developer, nor a programmer, I'm mostly an aspiring programmer (I use R and a little Python), but the way Emacs forces me to stay focused on what I'm doing, to organize my notes, my documents, my GTD is something new and somehow irreplaceable.
 Thank you all. Thanks Emacs. And sorry for the unnecessary message.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have enabled pop in my gmail account and have the following in my .gnus:
 (setq gnus-select-method '(nnnil "")) ;; Define how Gnus is to read your mail. We read mail from ;; your ISP’s POP server. (setq mail-sources '((pop :server "pop.gmail.com" :port 995 :user "my@mail.com :stream ssl))))) ;; Say how Gnus is to store the mail. We use nnml groups. (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnml ""))) 
 When I launch gnus, I am prompted for my password, and then dumped into an empty buffer with a minibuffer message saying "no news is good news". I get the same behavior using the wrong password too, so I am not even sure if it is trying to connect to the server. Those options in my mail-sources are what is given to me by Gmail when I look into their "Configuring your email client" instructions. How do I debug this?

The temporal and accreting nature of analog Zettelkasten as its main benefits
Why does analog Zettelkasten work so well?
In [1] I discussed how analog Zettelkasten cures my perfectionist tendencies, as opposed to digital systems, by making editing cumbersome. I also believe that a key benefit of an analog system is being able to trace the development of my thoughts over time.
This idea goes against the views of many digital Zettelkasten aficionados, who believe that their Zettelkasten should reflect their current view of each idea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I enjoy the code-writing experience Emacs and the community provides. But this is the 8th year since I joined the party and I still feel overwhelmed. Usually when I write code, random "problems" still show up here and there, even I have "solved" a lot in the past.
 By "problem", I mean issues, warnings, behaviors that don't work the way I like, configurations I have to choose and balance, even functionalities I used to know but forget their shortcuts, function names or triggers.
 If I ignore those "problems", they will just stay there and continue to popup every now and then until I upgrade the whole packages and hoping those problems get automatically solved.
 If I solve them, it usually take some time which will interrupt my normal workflow. This is annoying.
 There are two solutions I can think of:
  
Either "problems" get fewer as time goes (which is usually not the case). or
 I get control over Emacs and can solve every "problem" really quickly.
  
In terms of option 2, what can I do? Should I
  
get better at common lisp?
 read more packages' source code?
 remember more built-in elisp functions?
 write a package from start?
 just spare a fixed amount of time fixing Emacs problem every day?
  
What's your experience and solution? What's your advice to people like me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using Obsidian / VSCode for many years now, but wanted to 'get the hang of' Emacs to see why it is regarded as the most efficient way to manage code/info. The last time I used Emacs was in the 90's but I don't recall it being extra special at the time. (I probably wasn't looking at all the features though)
 I am feeling good about Emacs now - I find myself working pretty easily with it, and am finally getting the hang of some of the shortcuts (it was really difficult at the start to not C V )
 CSV editing is great - columns can be aligned easily
 Dired mode is the real bonus - apart from the initial oddness of clicking a folder and having it open in the next buffer, I am now loving it. It is really quick to jump around and edit multiple files, and the directory list itself is great to copy quickly from (making a lot of tiny CSV files). The marking of files via regexp is fantastic, and there are so many little things that make working just that bit easier.
 So, I have uninstalled VSCode and am using Emacs full time for coding now (still using Obsidian - the markdown links are a bit borked so I need to do some scripting to convert them so they work nicely)

 I installed the GUI version on windows 10 and one thing I have trouble figuring out is how to make the cursor position visible as in the lower part of this image which is taken from a screenshot of "Emacs from Scratch" 
 I would like to have something similar so I can find my position in the buffer. Unless I type something I do not know where in the line my cursor is (as in the upper part of the image)
 So far I only managed to set the hl-line-mode on so I can at least find the line I'm in, but several things I tried to put in my config that I found in various forums led me to believe that I perhaps do not know the correct terminology for this setting.
 I tried
 (setq-default cursor-type block) 
 and 
 (setq make-pointer-invisible nil) 
 and tried changing the cursor color, but it didn't make it visible. 
 Any help would be appreciated, I'm sorry for asking such a basic question but I could not figure it out with googling it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have released version 0.6.0 of Kele, the spritzy Kubernetes management package for Emacs. Changelog here.
 Note: This release bumps the minimum required version of Emacs to 29.
 This release introduces the notion of kind-specific keybindings. Some resources have special "actions" associated with them, e.g. "restarting" Deployments or getting logs from Pods. kele-resource now has a dedicated column for these keybindings that, when defined, are dynamically filled in based on the selected resource kind. For now, there is only one resource-specific keybinding—R to restart a Deployment. Try s-k deployments to check it out.
 https://preview.redd.it/5orkdwttqb5d1.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e4da9c9ea2fc30a47556085f7c23c5e7483f5c
 In addition, individual bindings within kele-resource are disabled based on your permissions for the given context/cluster. In other words, if you don't have permission to list Pods within the selected cluster, Kele will disable the l keybinding with a helpful message.
 https://preview.redd.it/jkvqq4tuqb5d1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=474adba750c5dffb6a8f58cb03566fc92ff4cbdf
 Lastly, this release fleshes out the resource listing functionality. Some highlights:
  
In addition to opening a resource from the list view (RET), you can now also delete/kill the resource at point with k;
 The list view now shows the owner resource(s) for every list item; hitting RET with your cursor over the owner cell will instead open the owning resource;
 The list view now supports listing across all namespaces.

 For more details, see the Kele documentation. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you'd like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.
 Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've noticed that recording a macro when having a special input-method enabled (say TeX) and using isearch, the macro is terminated by ringing of the bell. I've found that one of the functions called is isearch-with-input-method (isearch-x.el), and it calls exit-minibuffer; commenting out that call, even though some things behave funny, at least doesn't terminate the macro. It also works if I disable the input-method temporarily, then use isearch, and simply turn it back on if I have to input something specific to the input-method; that however rules out any searching for special characters, which isn't ideal at all. Is there a way to remedy this? It seems strange to me that one shouldn't be able to record a macro simply due to using an input method... Help greatly appreciated! I'm using Emacs 30 from homebrew-emacs-plus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been watching tsoding (btw reallly recommend his channel if you’re into software engineering) and I came across some manipulation he did with emacs. See the clipped video. I have been trying to search about how to do it. Does anybody know? Also, I have been trying to learn how to « learn » more effectively. This is a perfect example of something I see is possible but I don’t know how to search emacs docs for it. Would you mind sharing your usual flow of search?
 Thanks people and have a nice week end !

 If doom emacs is installed correctly, should evil-mode be working when I start up emacs? Are there commands I can run inside of emacs to check if evil-mode is installed and enabled?

I am an early stage PhD student for computer science.
I've been using a Zettelkasten-esq system in Typst (a LaTeX alternative) to keep track of my research, coursework, and a few serious hobbies.
My current in-Zettelkasten obsessions include disparate but I-swear-they-make-sense-in-my-head subjects such as:
Vector databases and sparse graphs
Package queries and user defined functions
Matroid theory
Theory of order statistics
Whatever is going on in that feud between invasive biologists and conservation biologists
Early 20th-century Christian socialism
I am a little bit of a bat who is just passable enough at seemingly unrelated topic in databases and mathematics to eek out some papers. As a professor told me, it's easier to be first than to be the best. And, if you're not cut out for pure mathematics, just get into applied-applied-applied mathematics of computer systems!
My current Zettelkasten iteration is a bit weird; if it matures and stands the test of time, I may divulge further. Its main principle is to help me keep on chugging along and do some real work.]]></summary>

In knowledge work, the Pareto Principle suggests that 20% of the activities contribute to 80% of the achievement, making it especially pertinent in knowledge management.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently done some work where I wrote a parallel test loop for QuickCheck (QC). I did this in collaboration with Koen Claessen, Nicholas Smallbone, and Bo Joel Svensson.
 It is not merged in the QC repository yet, and it will take some time (it is a significant change). I must have implemented five different versions along the way, and what is there now is a mix of all of them. I am happy with the end result, but had to rush a bit in the end to reach a deadline. There is some wonky code lingering around my fork that will go away in due time.
 If you would like to try it out before it gets merged, I have written up some instructions in the link below. I have also included some of my results as well as links to both the code and paper :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This isn't Scala specific, but I thought it would be a good place to ask.
 I'm working on forming my thoughts on error handling, and I'm looking for any existing writing that I should be aware of. Specifically I'm looking for anything that compares and contrasts control flow driven (ie. exceptions) and data driven (unions, tuples, monads of various flavors, etc.) error handling.
 Other free food for thought: It seems like as of 2.13 the Scala ecosystem had pretty well settled into data driven error handling of various flavors. With Scala 3 there are new options on the horizon for control flow based error handling. Interestingly things like boundary break syntax for error handling in ox looks very much like monadless syntax, but works totally different under the hood.
 disclaimer: when I say control flow driven error handling, I don't mean the anti-pattern of intentionally using exceptions for control flow

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Generally I have been enjoying reflex but this time I've stuck with what seems like a very simple feature for days! Hopefully someone can help.
 Let's say I have a dynamic list of some value and a delay Dynamic t [(Text, NominalDiffTime)]
 I've been trying to end up with an Event t Text which would be an event stream that fires as many events as there were in the list with very limited success.
 This event stream should be triggered by another event Event t ().
 I've been trying something like
 haskell performEvent $ ffor theTriggerEvent $ \_ -> do valuesAndDelays <- sample . current $ valuesWithDelays ... construct the event stream 
 but the problem is that I can't use delay inside Performable.
 I have a gut feeling this is some sort of a fold but I can't wrap my head around it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When writing elisp code and looking for a function that would do something you need, what do you use to find it, inside Emacs only (no web search)?
 Emacs has a lot of built-in documentation; it has
  
a help system,
 an info system,
 Apropos
 all code has docstrings,
 for other outside help, it has an excellent support for the man pages with: 
 man and woman
 
  
On top of that you can install other complementary packages that add more help search features such as:
  
helpful (which is excellent)
  
There's a lot of commands available with the C-h or <f1> key prefix and lots that are not bound by default.
 I documented the ones I know and created some others in my system in this PDF: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/master/doc/pdf/help.pdf
 Despite all of that, every so often, I stumble to find the name of a function that I know exists but can't remember the name. The other day I was looking for the predicate function that tells whether point was at the beginning of line; bolp.
  
I tried typing beginning and using C-M-i to complete it. That did not work.
 I typed C-u C-h d for apropos-documentation and got a long list of suggestions from which I searched for "beginning .? line" with some regexp and finally I found bolp at line 7833 of the Apropos buffer.
  
I eventually found it, but it took longer than I like. And was very tempted to search the internet or depend on a connection to the outside world (eg, IA). But there must be a better way to quickly find functions in Emacs.
 How do *you\* quickly find the functions you need *inside Emacs*?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the best way to sync installed package versions between different computers?
 I have been using use-package with :ensure t for a long time (with the default package.el as the backend). But I've read posts from experienced Emacs users suggesting to not do this. Instead, they recommend using package-install manually and then check ~/.emacs.d/elpa into their dotfiles repo, so that you sync the exact set of installed packages between computers. This is supposed to make the config more reproducible, since after a git pull every computer will have the same "Emacs state".
 This idea appeals to me, especially since I've noticed that (i) sometimes my config doesn't bootstrap correctly on new computers, (ii) sometimes package upgrades break my setup and I want an easy way to roll everything back when I need to just get work done, and (iii) I've started relying more on GitHub packages (via package-vc-install-from-checkout) and would like to avoid having to repeat this on new hosts.
 Some more concrete questions for those who follow this approach:
  
If you sync your installed packages in this way, what exactly do you sync (i.e. what's your `.gitignore`)? 
 I guess you *should* sync the `*.el` files, otherwise there's not much point.
 I guess you *shouldn't* sync the natively compiled {`*.eln`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`} files.
 But what about the byte compiled `*.elc` files? Are these portable across different operating systems, different processor architectures, different Emacs ports, and different Emacs major versions?
 
 After syncing, do you need to do anything special to make things work? 
 For example, is `package-recompile-all` required?
 
  
Or is all this a fools errand, and I should instead switch tox e.g. elpaca, straight, etc.? Since I left Spacemacs and Doom Emacs some years ago, I've mostly stuck to the default package.el when I use Emacs (I regularly use Vim as well). But I am open to other tools if they make my life significantly easier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was trying to use replace-string to remove the underline-creating underscore prefix/suffix pairs at various points in an Org document. But neither it, nor any of the related replace/search commands appear to be able to find them. This only happens in this pairing scenario, where there's an underscore both at the start of the first word in a sequence, and at the end of the last word. Otherwise the underscore is found by search as it should be.
 Can anyone explain what causes that?
 FWIW, the replace/search fails regardless of whether I havecase-fold-search defaulting to t or to nil (although that does affect what message I get when the replace/search fails).
 ADDED: I've just noticed that the same problem exists with all six of the formatting characters mentioned in the manual, viz.: *, /, _, =, ~, and (if I must 🤓) + . I guess that should be a clue as to what the cause is, but I don't see it yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! Switched to emacs somewhat recently, and I use a long running daemon on a server, ssh into the server, and emacsclient into it. I use emacs as both an editor and also a "runner" i.e. all of my long running tasks run inside shell or vterm. I usually can find the shells that I need but, I'd like a way to group shells / text editors / direds together according to "projects" (and have the ability to switch to buffers/shells only within that project) In addition, I'd like these projects to be permanent and restore-able. I.e. I quit emacsclient, have projects open and associated buffers (shells and text). Then the next day I can reopen emacsclient and restore the same setup. I've tried a bunch of ways to do this (projectile, project.el, perspectives, beframe, tabmode) but can't seem to be able to find a setup that ticks all the boxes above. I'm also honestly a little overwhelmed by the choices here :D Thanks for any pointers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently saw a tweet featuring an upcoming improvement to Metals that would allow you to interact with code and use completion/navigation while the project is not in a compiling state.
 This is more challenging to do than it sounds, and I wrote a tiny blurb about the problem and the proposed solution.
 TL;DR The Scala team at VirtusLab is working hard on improving the experience of using Scala 3 with Metals, but I also believe this could greatly benefit IntelliJ IDEA as well.

 I am desperately trying to get doom emacs in terminal mode (emacs -nw) to have a transparent background. I have tried everything that I could think of and find as resources, but I can only get the emacs GUI to have the transparent background by following emacs wiki and setting in my doom emacs config.el:
 (set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha-background 70) (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha-background . 70)) 
 My emacs version is emacs29-pgtk. I am using the kitty terminal and have already made the terminal itself transparent.
 I would greatly appreciate any tips on how to make this work, as I have tried for a long time and have no idea why this is not working.

I couldn't get the LABEL setting for :id to do what I expected.
 Same thing with the :match setting.
  
One cool trick--add a number of rows with a :noexport: tag and put the columnview dynamic block outside of them--made reporting a bit easier as a way to avoid including headings that aren't necessary except as property containers.
 While the above's mostly a complaint, I do have a constructive question: how can we get a cookbook of working examples that show uncommon usecases (e.g. using column view as a multi-line workaround for tables)?

and that stands even more true for Python monoliths.
Python’s versatility is convenient, yet a very big gun to shoot one’s foot with.
If there’s one thing I’ve learnt over the years of building software,
it’s the importance of testing to mitigate risks and allow refactoring in the long run.
In my experience however, I’ve seen much less testing in projects than I would’ve liked.
If it can be rarely attributed to plain malevolence or stupidity,
the most recurrent reason is: it is hard and it takes too much time.
The issue is, it’s often true!
So how can we lower the barrier to make testing easier?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a way to generate a traditional "org chart" (e.g. for a company) from an Org mode file.
 So far I've tried out org-mind-map† (via graphviz). It works, but the output is more DAG-like than the kind of thing you see with a standard organizational chart††. I know that org-mind-map-engine offers some control over the format, but none of the options match what I'm looking for.
 Does anyone know if I can get what I'm after out of org-mind-map?
 Or, if not, any other Org mode-based suggestions?
 Thanks!
  
† I'm using the-ted/org-mind-map via melpa, rather than the unpackaged fork at alphapapa/org-mind-map . That's simply because although it's a fork, the latter appears to be behind the former in commits. The forked code looks to be the unmodified v0.1 of the original, whereas the original is now at v0.4. But if anyone (e.g. u/github-alphapapa himself :-) ) thinks there's more going on there, and that the fork actually is the one to use, let me know.
 †† For example, in the traditional org. chart, a parent node with multiple child nodes would connect to its children using a single line with branches off it to each child (and the parent). Something like this. By contrast, org-mind-map's DAG-style has a separate line from the parent to child for each of the children.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using emacs & org for knowledge management, and I often need to search my notes. One of the ways I do this is with +default/org-notes-search (from search.el, maybe it's a doom thing? It just wraps ripgrep on org-directory), which displays two windows; a list of results on the bottom and a preview of the currently selected result on the top window.
 I don't hard-wrap my text files; I rely on visual-line-mode instead. This makes searching kind of annoying, because I can't get the preview window (the top one) to wrap long lines. The closest I've been able to get is by doing this:
 `(add-hook 'occur-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode)`
 which sort of enables visual-line-mode in the preview window... but only sometimes, and only if I click in that window to focus its buffer. I can then go back down to the results and flip through results in the same file, but when I Get to the next file I have to refocus the results buffer again.
 Anyone have an idea of how I can get this to work seamlessly? Extra bonus points if I can enable visual-fill-column-mode too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How can I skip certain heading levels in org clock tables? I'd like to skip certain "boring" headings from clock table reports.
 I organize my projects GTD style like this:
 * Sell My Home ** Purpose / Expected Outcome - Sell my home for a lot of money ** Project Reference - Asking price :: $100 - [[https://zillow.com][Zillow]] - [[https://realtor.com][Realtor]] ** Actions *** TODO Research Home Values :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2024-06-05 Wed 09:00]--[2024-06-05 Wed 10:00] => 0:00 :END: *** TODO Create Listing :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2024-06-05 Wed 10:00]--[2024-06-05 Wed 11:00] => 0:00 :END: 
 I use clock tables like this:
 #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope file :maxlevel 4 :compact t :block today #+CAPTION: Clock summary at [2024-06-05 Wed 11:06], for Wednesday, June 05, 2024. | Headline | Time | |----------------------------+------| | *Total time* | *2:00* | |----------------------------+------| | Sell My Home | 2:00 | | \_ Actions | 2:00 | | \_ Research Home Values | 1:00 | | \_ Create Listing | 1:00 | #+END: 
 I'd like to skip the "Actions" row, like this:
 | Headline | Time | |----------------------------+------| | *Total time* | *2:00* | |----------------------------+------| | Sell My Home | 2:00 | | \_ Research Home Values | 1:00 | | \_ Create Listing | 1:00 | 
 Is it possible to either exclude certain heading levels, or (better) exclude certain headings, but still include their children? For example, exclude "** Actions" but still include its children. I see there is a matchoption, but I'm looking for an exclude option, based on the header name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am considering to give haskell a go (again). I actually wanted to earlier but got discouraged by an (at that time) very clunky tooling experience, and I also found it annoying that I had to use pragma's to for example enable exhaustive type checking (which imo always should be default). At the time I instead decided to dive into Purescript, which I have been enjoying quite a lot ever since. I have probably written somewhere around 10k lines of purescript by now. However, I feel that purescript is quite niche and has some annoying limits due to primarily running on node or in the browser. For example, I don't see myself ever doing proper parallel processing in purescript. I also feel that purescript might be more limited in context of future job opportunities. These are the reasons for which I am considering to give learning Haskell a second try.
 Much learning material seems to be targeted at OOP programmers who are new to FP. I obviously don't need the the whole FP sales pitch with my background. What I need is more something along the lines of "I am comfortable with FP, monads, type classes and monad transformers, and now I want to learn Haskell without getting bored by the learning material".
 I have read the excellent purescript book called "Functional programming made easier" https://leanpub.com/fp-made-easier. My background before Purescript has been working professionally with F# and Clojure for a few years.
 On the longer run I am considering to do some Haskell certification https://certification.serokell.io/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm currently trying to generate MkDocs from my collection of org files, to have some sort of static documentation site based off my notes.
 My approach so far has been converting org to markdown with pandoc, to then feed all markdown files to mkdocs along with some custom css.
 This seemed quite straightforward, however I soon realised there are a few caveats: - pandoc org parsing is not 100% accurate and some elements are missing (e.g.: task priorities are not parsed to their own AST element) - mkdocs extends markdown with custom syntax, this md block for instance:  ??? Drawer Lorem Ipsum  will be rendered as a collapsible drawer in the resulting html. This led me to write some custom pandoc filters, for example to convert a :NOTES: org drawer to a ??? NOTES md block.
 In all fairness, it's becoming a bit complex and there's a lot of stuff I'm not covering yet.
 So the reason for this post is to ask you for guidance about what approach to use, I see 3 options: 1. continue with the current approach of using pandoc, adding more logic/filters when needed 2. use a different, more complete, org parser and then generate mkdocs-compatible markdown myself 3. write something entirely in Elisp, similarly to projects like ox-hugo.
 I'm a bit of an Elisp newbie, so I'm not sure how feasible it is for me to tackle option 3, other than that feel free to suggest other options.
 Thank you for taking the time to read this!

 However, for open-ended work, which is endemic to small companies in their high-growth and product development phase, these tools (and many, many others) fall down in a lot of ways.

 It's working pretty well with the exception of the Eldoc documentation. When I hover over something, the documentation correctly shows in the minibuffer, but when I open the Eldoc buffer with eldoc-doc-buffer, the documentation is repeated multiple times.
 I tried debugging it and found out that if I remove eglot-signature-eldoc-function from eldoc-documentation-functions, I get only one item in the Eldoc buffer. However, I don't know how to prevent Eldoc from adding this item and thus avoid the duplication in the Eldoc buffer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been experiencing random flickering on the pgtk build of emacs on wayland in the recent months since updating to nvidia-drivers version 535 from 525.
 I am building Emacs from source with pgtk enabled every week. And I am quite sure it is related to Nvidia because all the flickering goes away when I downgrade to nvidia-525. I am now on Nvidia 550 and the issue persists. 
 I have an RTX2060 with Gentoo.
 After some testing, I find that all OpenGL related applications especially with lower version of OpenGL like 3.x are having the same issue. I even wrote a bunch of SDL window to render simple textures to test that. All the others with vulkan does not have the same issue.
 I have messed around with Minecraft recently, and the launcher has an option of running OpenGL on Zinc, which is an OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan. If I run Minecraft with Zinc enabled, the flickering is gone.
 I believe Emacs is using OpenGL to draw on screen. Is there any workaround for me to run Emacs' OpenGL call via Zinc? Or does anyone have similar experience that have found a solution?

 pen.el was created in 2021 as an annotation tool, but I was not used it a lot at that time. Recently I picked it up and dramatically changed its usage. Now it is a complete solution of making annotations and language learning tools, right inside Emacs.
 pen relies on sqlite. All annotations are saved inside a database, which means it can be easily backup and you can read and make annotation right inside Emacs (PC/mobile) using same database.
 pen’s ideas are coming from all following great tools:
  
LingQ: Learning a language by reading
 Kindle Vocabulary Builder
 org noter
 Chatgpt
 SDCV
 go-translate
 Eudic
 蒙哥阅读器
  
and more.
 This package is mainly used along with:
  
nov-mode
 org-mode
 pdf-view-mode
 eaf-mode
  
But it is able to work with all modes in Emacs.

 If I had to bet I would say it's a Fedora problem, but how to know for sure? Because these crashes seem to only happen with Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I ported org-krita and org-xournalpp with custom link. They used to be based on creating their own overlay, and in my forks they are configured with `:image-data-fun` with org-mode custom links. So I commented out their minor mode definition, as they are no longer relevent; previewing images is done with `org-display-inline-images` like all other custom links.
  
https://github.com/hermanhel/org-krita (used github because I want to pull-request)
 
https://codeberg.org/Hermanhel/org-xournalpp (don't want to create gitlab account)
 
 story: 
 I was revamping on my solution to include visual illustrations in org-mode. I passed on them 2 because they were painful to use with that custom overlay, and they make huge overlays which is hard to adjust size. I used org-excalidraw for a bit, it was great, but the export tool it used excalidraw_export does not function properly at all in my KUbuntu 24.04 environment. I see the author's demo works perfectly in macOS, so maybe it is because of different svg library(excalidraw's own svg export does not display font correctly on my machine).
 I saw excalidraw use a image-data-fun, so I played around a bit and made org-krita and org-xournalpp the same. It is kind of weird that lambda do not work when I was testing, I had to declare my own functions and use function's symbol in `:image-data-fun`.
 enjoy.

 OS: Arch linux
 JDK: 21
 What I've done so far:
  
Install coursier per the website instructions
 update the JDK to version 21 of OpenJdk
 Install Metals extension with vs code.
 Create a new app using sbt sbt new scala/scala3.g8
 Open with vs code and import the sbt build for metals.
 Run metals doctor and get a bunch of warnings about version mismatches.
  
It seems like the current version of coursier ships with JDK 11 and I though it would be a good idea to update a more recent one. Seems like Metals supports up to version 21, but 17 is the current default.
 So, long story short, the environment is out of sorts. What would you all do in this situation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon, Emacsen
 I don't honestly use tree-sitter much -- my main language is well handled by the venerable vhdl-mode. However I had been using it many moons ago for a Typst document. I had all the libraries obtained, and snagged typst-ts-mode for the part where it does things with the tree-sitter output.
 I distinctly remember there being syntax coloring when I was using it before.
 I recently opened the same Typst document, and it's not doing anything with syntax highlighting. I dutifully updated Typst, the tree-sitter libraries, and typst-ts-mode and still no joy. I can turn on treesit-explore-mode and see tree-sitter correctly interpreting the code. So far, so good I guess. That's the main engine. (Also (treesit-language-available-p 'typst) returns true, so I think I'm pretty solidly in the tree-sitter active camp.)
 However I have been reading Mickey Peterson's article on tree-sitter (https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter), trying to make sure there wasn't some step I left out along the way. Also the tree-sitter Emacs documentation at https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/syntax-highlighting/. This last claims that there exists a function tree-sitter-hl-mode. I tried M-x tree-sitter- and about this time, completion offers up nothing. There are no tree-sitter functions! This is Emacs 29 and it was built with tree-sitter support so I would imagine that the basic functions would be there.
 Any ideas what went pear-shaped here? I started a ticket at typst-ts-mode's repo but I am not entirely sure if the issue is that I forgot to set something up, or if it is indeed that package.
 Thanks! I think I will remove the call to use typst-ts-mode and see if there's any difference in behavior. I THINK there's a slight snag when that buffer loads, but I'm not 100% certain just yet. (EDIT: doesn't appear to be a delay so it must have been my imagination)

That said, I am trying (purely for education) to explore this problem where my functions can return values while also modifying a key data structure, so I think using the State monad makes a lot of sense. At the same time, there is a function that might or might not successfully return a value, and if it fails to return a value, then I don't want my State to be changed. From what I have read, this could be handled with a MaybeT wrapped around the State monad, but I'm struggling to work this out in my brain, and I can't find any straightforward examples.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a way to have an Emacs frame that displays all term buffers as tabs (similar to a traditional terminal manager like gnome-terminal).
 The initialization of the frame that displays the terminals is easy enough using something like
  (dolist (buf (buffer-list)) (with-current-buffer buf (when (eq major-mode 'term-mode) (tab-bar-new-tab) (switch-to-buffer buf)))) 
 but then such a frame should keep track of terminal buffers being killed/created and add corresponding tabs. I can probably hack my way with appropriate hooks, but I wanted to know if there's a package that already does this.

Will org mode 9.7 come to doom emacs so that running `doom sync` gets the job done or will it come in a few months and until then, just manually install the latest org mode version?

 However, I am trying to run a haskell project/script using the GUI in Intellij.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a NES emulator in Haskell, and I'm getting pretty inconsistent frame rates.
 They are consistently inconsistent in the sense that I'll have a frame run at a rate of 130 FPS, and the next one at a rate of 30 FPS, followed by another frame at 130 and so on. 
 If I run with +RTS - p -RTS, I can get a center cost that tells me which functions take the longest.
 But I'm not interested in the mean cost of each function, but rather in the variance.
 Is there any way to profile this automatically? I would really prefer not to wrap every function I have in a timer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that Emacs is more than an editor. You can spend an entire life learning Emacs. It never stops and it adapts to anything you want to do with a computer. 
 Using one, or several terminal emulator buffers inside Emacs can be extremely useful. What's you use case?
 As for me, one thing I do often is create a keyboard macro that gathers information from one or several shell or REPL output to place it inside text file either for documentation or to create unit-test code. And sometimes I write some elisp code to do some of that. Being able to interact with an Erlang and Python REPL for example, with the OS shell of a local or remote computer and Emacs Lisp together (including with eshell) greatly enhance what can be done quickly. 
 Not all Emacs terminal emulators are made equal. I wrote a comparison table for the ones I know and what I have tested. That might be useful for others. It's here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/master/doc/pdf/shells-comparison.pdf 
  
This is part of a larger set, the index is accessible in the top-left corner. Use a browser that can render PDF directly instead of downloading the PDF for a better experience.
  
What are *your* use cases?

 You can upgrade from GNU ELPA or install with M-x package-install RET org RET
 Please, also re-install all the Org-related packages - some of the changes require re-compiling packages that use Org mode APIs.
 Release notes: https://orgmode.org/Changes.html
 Announcement: https://list.orgmode.org/87jzj7adfd.fsf@localhost/T/#u
 If you enjoy using Org, please consider supporting contributors via https://liberapay.com/org-mode/. Donations do help a lot.
 Some highlights of user-facing additions
  
Org mode supports drag-and-drop and pasting images/files from clipboard (pasting from clipboard requires Emacs >=29)

 I am trying to learn Lisp, and since most of the tutorials seem to use Emacs, I am learning Emacs at the same time. 
 Now, I have a 60% keyboard, and I was wondering whether I should move to a full-sized keyboard to use Emacs more easily?
 for example, the very first example in the Portacle tutorial requires typing ~ three times, which on a 60% keyboard is Fn-S-~ , so it is a bit of gymnastics. (Portacle is a packaged installation of Common Lisp with Emacs) 
 Thank you for any advice

 There are different oppinions about solving algorithmic problems during hiring process. Not a big fan of it, but I still see that employers include coding tasks in such platforms. My recently I was asked to pass task in HackerRank and Codility. For another interview Codewars was recommended for preparation. I quite enjoyed https://www.codewars.com I must say (not a promotion btw just sharing personal impression), however it does not have a lot of Scala tasks.
 I assume 90% of that market is occupied by Leetcode, but still curious whether you are practising solving such small coding tasks and if so, on which platform? 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I would appreciate some thoughts/opinions on this. 
 Preface: In my day to day work I am Java Dev using hibernate. I resented it at first (too much magic), but it kind of grew on me and I recently started to really appreciate it mainly in the following sense: When modeling my domain I can go full java-first, completely ignoring that my model is backed by a RDBMS, that is - code my model as if there were no DB, slap the right annotations on it, (make a few compromises here and there) and get going. It even forward engineers the ddl for me.
 So in scala world it seems to me that the accepted approach is to separate the model from the persistent model? 
 Here is why I think that: - the libraries I found map rows to case classes, but usually no built in support for inheritance, sealed trait hierachies, ... - no support for one to many aggregation - bad support for nested case class, especially if they occur multiple times
 Here is a sample of how I would model an invoice if there were no database
 scala case class Invoice( ... senderName: String, senderAddress: Address, // general purpose case class to not repeat myself recipientName: String, recipientAddress: Address, status: Status, // some sealed trait with cases like e.g. case Sent(when: LocalDate) positions: List[InvoicePosition] ... ) 
 I feel like I either - have to compromise A LOT in modeling my domain if I want to close to zero hassle with db libs out there - have my db access case classes be separated from the domain and do alot of mapping/transforming
 Any experiences, or hints? how do you handle this in your apps

 I'm not too experienced with Emacs-fu, but I think I might be developing a case of Emacs pinky. I've tried making some changes—I've adopted evil, god-mode, and I'm planning to buy a split keyboard this year.
 The main issue I'm facing is inefficient mini-buffer navigation. For instance, I use WSL, so there are a lot of nested folders I have to navigate through, which means I end up hitting TAB a lot, and it's painful.
 My current workflow looks something like this: C-x C-f ~/fol TAB (folder1) TAB nes er2 TAB (nested-folder2), and so on.
 For completion, I used Helm in the past. I use Vertico now because I believe I'll be able to master it sooner than Helm. I feel it's more predictable with more information available online on how to set it up. However, I liked how Helm handles completion with the RET flow instead of TAB unlike Vertico which opens Dired on RET. 
 Now, I have a few questions:
  
Is there a better way to navigate mini-buffer completions? 
 Is there a better way to navigate through nested folders efficiently?
 
 How can I mimic Helm-like completion behavior in Vertico?
 How do I turn off TAB completion so that I don't keep clicking out of habit, like I do with Capslock?
  
Thanks!

 Additionally, totally disabling standard org fontification (bold, italics, underline) in example blocks would be helpful, if anyone has any insight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm experimenting with composition-function-tableto add effects to certain sequences of characters, like shoving to characters closer together. I noticed that characters with descenders that extend below the baseline like "g", "j", and "y" can cause the line height to increase when rendered via `font-shape-string` via a custom entry in `composition-function-table`. This happens for example with the "M+ Code Latin 50" font, but only at certain font heights.
 The simplest reproduction is this:
 (set-char-table-range composition-function-table t '(["g" 0 font-shape-gstring])) 
 That causes this artifact, where typing a "g" causes the next line to shift downwards:
 https://cdn.zappy.app/801ae7a7b03d568b3b80500b04047054.gif
 It works fine (no line shifting) stock, but when I add an entry to `composition-function-table` the weirdness starts happening.
 I tried messing with the font in FontLab. I can fix the problem by increasing the Units per eM value, which causes the font to get smaller. I then increase the font height in Emacs to compensate. That works, but it's an odd thing to do, and I have to make the font height pretty large to get a normal-looking actual height. Other options in FontLab like increasing the line gap, safe descender value, etc didn't help.
 I'd like to understand why this is happening.
 EDIT: ";" (semicolon) is a more realistic example. I'm trying to create a ligature that will push ";;" closer together, for Lisp comments. However the semicolon in my font has a descender that extends below the baseline, causing the same line shifting effect as shown with the "g" above, when I try to use a ";;" ligature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To understand ghc's package management better, I decided to manually install vector package and see if it gets picked up by hls and if the final program compiles.
 I went to the vector package on hackage, saw it had two dependencies, vector-stream and primitive. I downloaded vector, vector-stream and primitive using the commands,
 cabal get primitive cabal get vector-stream cabal get vector 
 then first I compiled the dependencies primitive and vector-stream, using cabal build. That gave dist-newstyle directory.
 Inside dist-newstyle\packagedb\ghc-9.8.2 there was a .conf file, I edited it to point all the file references to the ghc package database which is ghcup\ghc\9.8.2\lib\x86_64-windows-ghc-9.8.2.
 I placed the entire downloaded package directory (eg vector-stream-0.1.0.1) inside ghcup\ghc\9.8.2\lib\x86_64-windows-ghc-9.8.2.
 Then I registered the package with
 ghc-pkg register <file>.conf 
 After performing above steps for primitive, vector-stream and vector respectively, vector was now being picked up by hls. GHC also compiles and links fine.
 Did I do it correctly? Will there be any issues in the future?
 I know this is not the preferred way at all, and you should be using cabal which streamlines this process. Vector had just 2 dependencies which already comes with base so it wasn't much of a hassle. This only for learning purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a backend that serves HTML using Warp and Servant (https://github.com/runeksvendsen/haskell-function-graph). Because some elements on the page take up to a second to load, I want to stream HTML to the client as it's produced, thus sending the slow-to-create HTML later.
 The HTML consists of (in order):
  
Static/pure "preamble" (which can be sent immediately)
 IO action streaming query results (which I want to stream as HTML one result at a time as they come in)
 A final IO action that calls out to an external process and produces HTML
  
I'm writing this post as I'm unsure what the most sensible way to achieve this is. On the one hand I would like to keep it as simple as possible — e.g. a MimeRender instance that produces a lazy ByteString. But this doesn't seem possible as the rendering involves IO. On the other hand I want to make sure that HTML is sent out as soon as it's produced, ie. no buffering on the server side — which makes me want to get a hold of some sendData :: Socket -> IO () function, so that I'm sure data is sent out when I want it. The former seems more elegant, but I don't see how it's possible (due to performing IO to produce the ByteString) and it's not clear to me how the server will buffer lazy ByteString chunks. The latter seems to do the job, but seems very low level.
 Any clues on how I should approach this?

 What happens to tasks that are DONE, do they get deleted or can you save them in history.

 I work on a remote server regularly and hence use screen for running various codes on the terminal. But now I want to switch to emacs in order to run my code instead of the terminal. I have tried screen on both vterm and eshell and both have failed to run screen. So couple of questions:
  
What is the best "term/shell" mode in emacs to run screen?
 If I let go the idea of using screen, and willing to adapt to other options like tmux, what is the best "term/shell" mode? Basically which is your preferred way to run terminal commands on emacs (which also accommodate remote screen/tmux/others)
  
Please let me know.

 I installed emacs 29.3 to test(switching from 28.2) but something is wrong with the compilation buffer. When I run 'compile(with running a .sh file) another windows launches(as usual) .For some reason if .sh file outputs something emacs hangs for a half a second or even a second before rendering the output in the other buffer. The output still renders as fast as 28.2 but it hangs before rendering the first output. If there is no output for some reason it works as usual.
 This issue happens on both 29.2 and 29.3 but not on 28.2. Does anyone have any idea what could cause this?
 Edit:
 It seems like colored ansi buffer which was attached to the compilaiton buffer output causes this on 29.3 and 29.2, I disabled it and it's fixed.

A boolean is maybe true by Håkon Robbestad Gylterud
The following is an exploration of a few functions I found while writing various Haskell programs over the years. Their names collide with some standard function in Prelude, which is unfortunate, and while the new functions cannot be used as drop-in replacements of the prelude functions, they are morally generalisations.

cabal-fields is partly motivated by the Migrate from the .cabal format to a widely supported format issue. Whether it’s a solution or not, it’s up to you to decide.

 I'll shortly be starting a new role as a tech writer, where much of the docs are written in Docbook and DITA.
 I'm hoping to do the bulk of my work in org-mode and export to the required format.
 I've seen an exporter for Docbook, but I wonder if anyone has successfully used Emacs/org-mode to work with DITA content? Any recommendations? How are custom tags handled? And how can I best work with Docbook/DITA files that were created in another editor, like OxygenXML?
 Thanks in advance.
 Edit: typo

 import scala.concurrent.{Future, Await} import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration def asyncCalculation1() = Future { Thread.sleep(1000) 10 } def asyncCalculation2() = Future { Thread.sleep(1000) 20 } val c = asyncCalculation1().flatMap { a => asyncCalculation2().map { b => a + b } } val d = Await.result(c, Duration.Inf) println(d) 
 As far as I understood, first thread (T1) will execute the asyncCalculation1function and content inside the Future will be handed over to a new thread (T2). Handling the flatMap function won't a responsibility of T1 as first Future is not completed, but it will be blocked by the Await.result function until it is resolved. Or T1 is going back to the pool?
 Meanwhile T2 thread will wake up from 1sec sleep and will return 10 as the result and start executing the asyncCalculation2 function and it will create another thread (T3) while doing that. After that, what will happen to T2? Will it go back to the global thread pool this time? Or is it set to a blocked/waiting status as T1?
 And finally T3 is the one responsible for executing the callback inside the map function. And now since T3 is the last thread to complete, for whom the Await.result function is waiting for?? Is it T2 or T3 ??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liquid Haskell is a compiler plugin for GHC that can
verify properties
of Haskell programs. It used to be a standalone analyser tool,
but it was converted to a plugin later on. This makes it feasible to support Haskell modules that use the latest language features, and immediately integrates
the verification into the build workflows; but it also implies that Liquid Haskell
is rather coupled with the internals of GHC. A consequence of this
coupling is that a version of Liquid Haskell is likely to require
modifications to support newer versions of the compiler. The effort
of making these modifications is large enough that Liquid
Haskell has lagged three or four versions behind GHC HEAD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have clang installed in a docker container which I'm able to interact with in emacs through tramp. The motivation is to replicate a dev-container like environment in emacs. As much as possible, at any rate (as per this post).
 I can access the docker container's filesystem through the path /docker:container_name:/path/to/file. I'm using the clang-format package in emacs, which allows me to run clang-format on buffers. I'd like it to use the clang-format binary installed in the container. By default, it will look on my local filesystem, so have fiddled with the clang-format.el. It used to read:
 (defcustom clang-format-executable (or (executable-find "clang-format") "clang-format") "Location of the clang-format executable. A string containing the name or the full path of the executable." :group 'clang-format :type '(file :must-match t) :risky t) 
 and have bodged it to the following:
 (defcustom clang-format-executable "/docker:container_name:/usr/bin/clang-format" "Location of the clang-format executable. A string containing the name or the full path of the executable." :group 'clang-format :type '(file :must-match t) :risky t) 
 But when trying to run clang-format in a buffer, I get:
 apply: Searching for program: No such file or directory, /docker:container_name:/usr/bin/clang-format 
 Clearly I'm doing something stupid, but I'm sort of out of ideas at this point. Presumably this is actually possible; eglot can invoke `clangd` in the container as its LSP; that all works really nicely straight out of the box, but I have absolutely no idea where to even start looking in eglot to figure out how it works...

 At the end I've reached the confirmation page.
 License request confirmation
 A few day later I've got an email with a link to the same page to fill out.
  
Dear Gyula, 
  
Thank you for your interest in Lightbend and registering for an Akka Startup License. 
 The Akka Startup License is a new BSL 1.1 source Available license, for Production usage, and there is no cost for companies with under $25M in revenue. Click here to register for an Akka Startup License.
 I've filled the same form again ang got exctly the same response... when I've found myself in an infinite loop. 
 I've also tried to respond to their email with the subject: "Last Chance for Akka Startup License!" which I've got the same response: fill out the (same) license request form I've filled out twice already.
 I get marketing newsletters since the first application, but still no idea how to reach them to get a startup license for my own small company. (way below $25M revenue)
 Any help would be most welcome!

Indent the file using the default indentation parameters.
  
which means enabling indent-tabs-mode and results mixed SPACE and TAB.
 Checking some Emacs built-in packages, such as simple.el and indent.el, via global-whitespace-mode, you will find they are all mixed SPACE and TAB.
 However, many coding styles guide recommend (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil) to use spaces for indentation. No hard tabs.
 Do you use TAB or SPACE for indenting Emacs Lisp code?
 Personally, I prefer SPACE over TAB for two reasons:
  
Many other programming language now use SPACE for indentation.
 SPACE is compatible with more editors without special settings. Note that because of the tab-width variable, using TAB is not a problem in Emacs, but other editors might not. For example, this let* is not aligned on GitHub.
  
TAB has its own advantage, such as reducing code size, but it's no longer a problem in 2024.
 Unfortunately, if you'd like to submit patches to the GNU Emacs community, you might still have to use TAB instead of SPACE to follow the convention. That is why I am still keep indent-tabs-mode enabled now.
 Any comment about it?

 But I can't stop thinking there must be a better/quicker way of doing this, something like Wdired for Agenda view?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! 
 I just started to organise myself with org-mode and org-roam. I tried out a bunch of different programs(notion, anytype, obsidian, logseq). From all of those Obsidian was the best since it was so easy to implement a working note taking system(and a second brain). The only problem with Obsidian is that it's not open-source and I can't use it on my work machine, so I decided to look for other options.
 In my work life I live in neovim like 90% of the time and I don't want to change that. (I tried Emacs for work, but that was a bad experience, since the lsp was slow and I spent several seconds between jump-to-definition etc.)
 I heard a lot about org-mode before, so I decided to give it a try and man.. I love it already. I see the unlimited possibilities(thatswhy it's so unfortuante that I can't use emacs as a primary IDE). 
 Now I'm trying to setup a meeting and personal tasking process for myself. In Obsidian I used the following people and meeting notes suggestion and it was very nice. people notes template, meeting notes template
 I'm looking for something similar. What I really like:
  
I have autocompletion for attendees
 I can query for meeting for an attendee in their person notes
 I can capture a new person very easily
 I can capture a new meeting either quickly or retroactively
  
I'm still learning the capabilities of org, org-roam, so I just wanted to ask you how to implement a similar approach? 
 Do you have any other recommendation for me?
 I also like that I can leave next actions as todos, so I can see them in org-agenda.

I won't go into a lot of detail, but basically it's traversing an s-expression graph and adding each sub-expression to a new representation, called a Case. When it adds a sub-expression, it checks whether that sub-expression has already been added, and if it has, it doesn't bother trying to add it again. In my old code, I can use a guard to do that check. In the new code, there's no way to use a guard (I think) because the Case is the state, and thus it is not directly available until I grab it with get.

After each user interaction with the web app, the server renders a new HTML, computes the diff, sends it to the client and the thin JS layer on the client side applies it to update the page.
 This tech is available with:
  
Elixir Phoenix - Live View
 Ruby on Rails - Hotwire
 C# Blazor
  
At a glance, it's an exciting tech as you no longer need to worry about splitting your app into two platforms, or at least minimize such a split.
 AFAIK Play or any other Scala web framework doesn't feature anything like that. Has anyone been working on an implementation for Scala? What are your thoughts on the tech? Particularly, Elixir claims they e.g. have an advantage over Ruby due to its parallel-first runtime - how do you think Scala's parallel capabilities (Akka, Pekko) relate to Elixir's runtime?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/completing-read-strings
 The package provides a function, completing-read-strings, that allows to read strings in the minibuffer, with completing-read under the hood.
 Usage:
 (completing-read-strings "PROMPT: " '("first" "sec,ond" "third")) 
  
The candidates are chosen by pressing RET.
 Pressing C-<backspace> erases the last chosen candidate.
 Pressing C-<return> exits reading and returns the list of chosen candidates.
  
Rationale
 In completing-read-multiple, the result list of chosen strings is made by splitting the input string with crm-separator regular expression variable.
 This approach is not suitable in several situations:
  
Candidates might contain the default , separator. In this case, the candidate with , inside will be treated as two typed candidates:
  
Example:
 (completing-read-multiple "PROMPT: " '("first" "sec,ond" "third")) ;; <selecting "sec,ond"> ;; => ("sec" "ond") 
 A developer have to locally rebind crm-separator and tell the user which character to type to separate the candidates.
 (let ((crm-separator "[ \t]*|[ \t]*")) (completing-read-multiple "Type `|' to select another candidate: " '("first" "sec,ond" "third"))) 
  
Candidates might contain any character, so it's hard to pick easily typed separator. Example: Org headings, file names. In this case a developer might use \n as a separator, which a user can enter by pressing C-o and moving the cursor 1 char forward to be able to display the list of candidates (which is not convenient).
  
Example:
 (let ((crm-separator "[ \t]*\n[ \t]*")) (completing-read-multiple "Prompt: " '("first." "sec,ond" "third;"))) 
 completing-read-strings solves the issue by providing a function that have the same interface for all kind of candidates. Internally, collects the chosen candidates into a list during reading and then returns it (without the need to split the input string with regular expression).

 I sometimes want LSP to auto-import some dependencies. When I call `lsp-execute-code-action`, expecting auto-import action to be executed, emacs creates empty file and moves me to there instead.
 When there is no code action, LSP inserts a dumb action for creating a new file and moving there. So if LSP is too slow to find out the actual code action needed, it creates a new file instead.
 This issue is ruining my workflow and wanted to ask if anyone else encountered. I got following shourtcut in my setup:
 (local-set-key (kbd "M-i f") 'lsp-execute-code-action)
 Any recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Mouse to operate Emacs. 
 Place the cursor somewhere (pos1) at LINE 1 (without mark anything), then scroll the text down through the window, press SHIFT and click at somewhere (pos2) at LINE 1000. The expected behavior is selecting all text content between pos1 and pos2, just like VS CODE and other modern editors. Is this behavior possible in Emacs?
 One possible technical barrier I found is that Emacs cursor moves as the screen scrolls and cannot be fixed in a certain position, except mark it manually. 
 P.s. I know there is variable `scroll-preserve-screen-position`, but it is not what I want.

 Outside of academia (Agda, ?Idris/Idris2), what could be some advantages of dependent types? 
 Note: indeed, 'outside of' is a relative term here--many say Haskell is an ivory tower language.

I noticed that if I opened an 11MB org-mode file (that used to give me no problems with speed or performance on 28.2) and then invoked org-refile once, then suddenly any user interaction involving the big 11MB buffer (from text entry to simply activating the buffer) would take forever to execute.
 I wondered if it was something in my config, and eventually noticed that switching org-refile-use-cache from t to the default nil stopped the slowdown from happening after invoking org-refile. I confirmed the issue was seemingly solved by running a minimal org-mode config in an emacs -Q session and observing that the slowdown only happened if org-refile-use-cache was set to t.
 So I decided to just stop setting org-refile-use-cache to t and everything …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently use Google Contacts to manage my contacts on Android and PC (web app). But I'm now trying to get rid of Google (I just started using notmuch, goimapnotify, mbsync, msmtp, etc. instead of Gmail web app).
 I read that synching Google Contacts with a Desktop was a nightmare, so I thought about using an open-source Android contact management app instead (like Fossify Contact, OpenContacts or ConnectYou).
 The idea would be to start from a Google Contact export and then continuously populate either the Mobile app or the Desktop app.
 On the Desktop side, I'd prefer to use Emacs (e.g. ebdb or org-contact). Ideally, Syncthing would do the sync between Mobile and Desktop.
 I couldn't find tutorials on how to implement this. Would you have any advice (my desktop OS is Linux Arch)?

 It looks like every character is swapped with something. It is reflective too which is very interesting in my opinion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How is the support for tree-sitter syntax highlight on LaTeX files currently? I've been using Emacs 29 with tree-sitter explicitly enabled when building it (probably redundant for 29, but just to be sure), and still couldn't find a way to enable it for TeX mode. Could someone using it now help me by pointing out where to start to make it work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just installed a brand new Debian GNU/Linux 12 box, then installed GNU Emacs 28.2 using `apt-get install emacs`. It works fine. But when editing a regular text-file, I find about one time in eight that I press the space bar, as well as inserting the space, it emits a beep, as though I had typed C-g. This seems to be random: sometimes I will type 20 or more spaces with no beeps, other times two or three consecutive spaces might beep. The space-bar is bound to regular self-insert-command as you would expect.
 Does anyone know how to prevent this harmless but very irritating quirk?
 (And why is it happening straight out of the box?)

 There are multiple implementation of doctest with different tradeoffs:
  
doctest: the original one. See this pretty example: r/haskell/comments/14xizu0/haddockdoctestcairo/
 doctest-parallel. See its announcement: r/haskell/comments/rnkof1/ann_doctestparallel_isolate_and_speed_up_your/
 doctest-extract
 Maybe more, please share!

It comes with copilot and I use it when something don't make sense in my code and to write commit messages and do a quick chat in vscode. I cant affort any other paid service and i hate using vscode. Neovim has a great extension for copilot chat with plethora of features but on emacs side the support is very minimal with just the copilot.el. I can understand why such thing land late in emacs community due to FOSS principles and i totally respect that. Should i lose hope on good copilot support in emacs and just accept the reality? Folks who use copilot is there any good copilot package that i am not aware of?

 You can see the glitching on left side of screen. I use NixOS with Hyprland and Emacs 29 (PGTK) with some transparency. I turn on my line numbers with `(nix-ts-mode . display-line-numbers-mode)` for example. I notice after resizing the frame all goes back to normal. Any ideas ?

 As sage is just python in syntax, is there someway to keep using python for syntax and highlighting, but use sage as the label?

Before using Doom Emacs, I used Visual Studio (for Unity and Unreal Engine) and VSCode for other projects. My question is, is it viable to use Doom Emacs with Unity and Unreal Engine, or should I stick with Visual Studio and change VSCode for emacs(basically use Doom emacs for other projects that dont require a game engine like unreal or unity and use Visual Studio for those two)?

  ("ce" (find-file "~/.emacs.d/config.org") "emacs") 
 which runs find file on the exact path given after I open the menu and press the keys "ce".
 Now I also want to add shortcuts to all my common directories but doing something like:
  ("hd" (find-file "~/Downloads/") "downloads") 
 runs the find-file on the exact directory path which just opens a dired directory into Downloads. 
 What I really want though is after typing "hd" it opens the minibuffer with find-file command (as happens when you type C-X C-f) with the ~/Downloads path already open so I can just pick a file from Downloads from the minibuffer itself.
 Is there a function to make something like this possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 After reading a couple of posts on here covering aspects of gc-cons-threshold, I checked the documentation too. 
 As a not-very advanced Emacs user, I will admit that the topic is not very clear. Trying to summarize what I think I read:
  
by setting the gc-cons-threshold to a high value, garbage collection can be temporarily delayed
 
a large value shouldn't be used as the default.
 
 If the above is correct, would that suggest that:
  
I could set the gc-cons-threshold to a higher value at the beginning of the init.el
 
Use the after-init-hook to reset the value to a lower/default value.
 
 Does the above make sense or have I misunderstood the other threads/documentation?
 As regards the gc-cons-percentage, the doc says "If this portion is smaller than ‘gc-cons-threshold’, this is ignored". How can I check this?
 thank you

 I use Debug.Trace a lot in my project for quick and flexible generation of debug statements - without having to change my code (e.g. adding IO). However, since recently i do want to save my debugging output to a file. For this i thought i could redefine trace:
 myTrace :: String -> a -> a myTrace msg x = unsafePerformIO $ do withFile "debug.log" AppendMode $ \h -> do hPutStrLn h msg hFlush h -- Ensure the message is flushed to the file immediately return x 
 This works in some cases, but when applying everywhere in where i originally used trace, i quickly get: *** Exception: debug.log: openFile: resource busy (file is locked)
 Understandable. Is there an alternative approach for what i am trying to achieve? (writing quick debug statements to a file without having to change my code structure too much)

 I see a lot of posts here asking what monads and functors are. Obviously there's a lot that can go into answering that question, but I have been thinking about one simple answer. Monads and functors, like all type classes, are abstractions. That is, they take some abstract concept, such as (in the case of functors) applying a function to all the values within a computational context, and they apply this abstract concept to the concrete implementation across several different data structures.
 In doing this, type classes serve two purposes. Fi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to look at how we highlight a major ts mode (to understand it and see if I can easily do it for markdown with injections) 
 I just took a look at python-ts-mode and saw that
 it does
 ```(setq-local treesit-font-lock-settings python--treesit-settings)```
 and after that to my surprise I checked python--treesit-settings and it kind of reimplements the same capture groups as the highlight file already created by the tree-sitter-python github https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python/blob/master/queries/highlights.scm
 for example
 ```
 :feature 'number
 :language 'python
 '([(integer) (float)] @font-lock-number-face)
 ```
 already exists in the highlights file
 ```
 [
 (integer)
 (float)
 ] @number`
 ```
 why can't we just use the highlight group `@number` somehow and set it to `@font-lock-number-face`
 seems a lot of double work if we do it for every language

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was reading the book Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton. In chapter 11, the game tic-tac-toe is implemented. My question is about the AI part of the game, where minimax is used. I was a little bit confused about the prune function:
 prune :: Int -> Tree a -> Tree a
 prune 0 (Node x _) = Node x []
 prune n (Node x ts) = Node x [prune (n-1) t | t <- ts]
 Why do we need such a prune function in Haskell (which has lazy evaluation). Why can't we just create a single infinite game tree, and run the fitness function on it to a certain depth, without creating a new finite tree via pruning? We can then reuse the same tree, by cutting it from the top after each move, and sort of expanding the (same) tree downwards. Shouldn't this also work? 
 I then saw that one of the exercises of that chapter was:
 generate the game tree once, rather than for each move 
 A solution for that exercise is provided here by someone on Github. However, it seems to me that here a new tree is generated after each move, and thus the tree is not shared during the whole game.

Is it possible to save this set of windows/layout and quickly switch to it in the future? Or when I'm programming, I typically have a main window with my code on the left with two smaller windows (compilation and vterm) next to it. I would like to be able to quickly switch between sets of predefined windows within a frame. Wouldn't that be amazing? Is such a thing possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've been using Emacs for 2+ years now. I started using because of its capabilities in VHDL coding, but soon got inspired by its efficiency. However, I feel I am severely underutilizing its potential. I'm a PhD student in Computer Engineering, and mainly use it for coding in python (with jedi). With this context, I want to ask the following questions:
  
Best package for Python? I find jedi decent, but not coding-friendly. I want to code faster in Python.
 For a Mac user, what are the key-bindings you suggest is optimal?
 Best use cases of org-mode as a PhD student?
 Best LaTeX packages & engines I need to install on Emacs? Currently I use Overleaf to work with collaborators, but would love to work on Emacs and push things to Overleaf (my vim friend does this).
 Ways to use Co-Pilot on Emacs? Is it worth it?
 Any other cool Emacs things (packages or modes) I should learn as a PhD student?
 Any cool stuff that can wow me about Emacs?
  
Please feel free to help even if you are not a PhD student. My goal is to learn how to use Emacs better at the end of the day..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[{reified from a comment on another thread}
 Is there an online place where I can paste some Scala 2 code with required braces, and have it show me that same code converted into Scala 3 braceless syntax?
 Does Scastie do it? If so, how? {related ticket, please go vote for it}
 Does the IntelliJ Scala plug-in facilitate it? If so, how? (related ticket, please go vote for it)
  
Here's a solution posted as a Reddit comment
  
This auto conversion would be invaluable for anyone who is distantly related to a Scala 2 project (or StackOverflow Question or Answer) and would like to easily explore the new Scala 3 syntax without having to invest a whole day in spurious technical tangents trying to configure something to enable them to do so.
 There are almost 20 years of Scala 2 codebases and forum code snippets where this would ease the ROI analysis of a Scala 3 explorer.
 tl;dr The overhead for experimenting with converting a Scala 2 code snippet into Scala 3 braceless syntax is so high for all but the most motivated Scala advocates.
 Wouldn't reducing the barrier to entry for casual drive-by exploration in something like Scastie (or IntelliJ) with a Scala 2 code snippet from the wild seems like it would be worth its weight in attention-grabbing and capturing the legions of possibly interested Java and Python software engineers?

In particular, if I choose View, it no longer defaults to opening in Preview.app (which is my choice). Why did it change all of my defaults and how can I get them back?

 My goal is to use CMake to build the C++ code and include the library. I am having a hard time linking to GHC's RTS.

This flow diagram was introduced in Field Report #5: How I Prepare Reading and Processing Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson:

I was hoping to discuss/ask some questions regarding it as I was recently processing it.
I'm guessing @Sascha will have to speak to this the most. But I am happy to have any others engage or share their thoughts.
Human Group
I was trying to understand the "Human" grouping and its sub-entities. What is it supposed to mean exactly? Is it what is happening within a human? Is there a semantic difference between the shapes under "human" and "zettelkasten?"
Is the entity under "human" an emergent outcome of the process it is connected to? For example, "overview of literature" is emerges in human understanding (ideally) when "researching" the "Sources of the world" and finding "Promising sources"?
Zettelkasten Group
What is the difference between the general group Zettelkasten (as opposed to Human) and the container "Zettelkasten" that has the two entities and one process "Atomic thoughts and connections," "Structuring & Integrating," and "Overview, Tools, Complex Insights"? Is the general group the Zettelkasten Method and the container the actual archive?
And, if the general group "Zettelkasten" is the Zettelkasten Method, what should the whole be called since the Zettelkasten method is a part of the whole?
Pre-processing
Is this a part of the barbell method (the first pass) or not?]]></summary>

I think one way would be to derive a mode from rjsx-mode but that seems like it might be overkill since there is no mode difference, just a difference in the configuration block. Probably thinking of the problem wrong.

 minbpe-hs
 Introduction
 minbpe-hs is a port of Andrej Karpathy's concise byte-level byte pair encoding (BPE) implementation, minbpe, to Haskell. During training, BPE compresses a sequence by repeatedly finding the most frequent pair of elements in the input and merging them into a new token whilst maintaining a record of the merges and the tokens. Encoding is performed by recursively merging pairs with the smallest merge index until there remain no pairs to be merged, and encoded representations can be decoded backed into the original through vocabulary look-ups. Given its recursive nature, BPE lends itself naturally to functional programming, and the objective of this repository is to offer an alternative functional formulation of it that is orthogonal to typical imp…]]></summary>

 Since I consider myself a part of this subreddit for some years, I wanted to let you know that I'm going to stop using reddit.
 As you might have expected, I've written a blog article explaining the reasons.
 I won't say that I will never ever log in to my reddit account and might contribute a comment in future. But chances to do so are poor because I will remove reddit from my feeds.
 I'm certainly not going to miss reddit as a platform. I surely will miss this subreddit community here. You've been great and I hope you will follow my ideas on embracing open solutions like Atom/RSS/Fediverse/Usenet in order to connect to each other for topics related to this subreddit.
 For now, I'm focusing on my blog, my Mastodon account, my new PIM lecture starting in October, and maybe also start writing on my PIM book which is in the concept and planning stage for over a decade.
 I really hope to see you on a better platform which respects its users and their contributions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone.
I consider this forum kind of “highly lectured” because we are all fans of knowledge and pretty much love to read, learn and improve everything we do. I picture us as carpenters working in the middle of the woods crafting excellence, although instead of wood and carpenter tools we use our brains, our zettlekasten and pen.
I don’t want to say too much because it’s not the point. Let’s just say I lost something that was really important to me. Something I cared, cherished, loved, tried to understand and that always put a smile on my face.
Now that it’s lost I have to learn what to do with this. I meditate and being mindful of all the feelings that arise inside me has been a really interesting experience. It of course doesn’t stop the grief or the sadness, but I think it makes it healthy. I’m at peace with my feelings, seeing me as the place where the river just has to flow.
I’m considering reading Albert Camus - The Stranger and No Mud no Lotus - Thich Nhat Hanh.
I’ve read before this event in my life works from stoicism and Buddhism which I think are really helping me to experience this in the best way possible.
Well, thanks for reading and I will appreciate the suggestions of books you found helpful during times where your psyche was put to the test.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya, just released this package that I was working on these past two days..
 It is a readwise integration for org-mode that will sync your readwise highlights into a org-format buffer or file.
 I use readwise heavily for highlights in both physical books and ebooks and have during the past year started using readwise reader heavily to annotate webpages and got so tired of not having a proper way to sync the highlights and notes into emacs. So I decided to just roll my own solution!
 There are quite a few quirks with the package right now, the main one being that it currently cleans the buffer and then repopulates it with the newly synced entries.. I am working for a smarter fix for this where it actually respects the buffer contents and just adds new highlights or modifies changed highlights to the correct entries, but I need to make this perfomant enough to not be a pain in the bottom to use..
 Well, here is the code! https://github.com/CountGreven/org-readwise I hope this helps some of you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This may be obvious, but I'm struggling to figure out how I could do this.
 Let's say I have a lot of open buffers, then do consult-buffer and type .py. From there I do embark-collect and now I have a collection buffer with all of the matching buffers from consult-buffer. Now I want to embark-act consult-line-multi on all of those buffers in the collection, so I can search only the one's I've narrowed down previously.
 This behaves in the way you expect using the buffer name as the search parameter for consult-line-multi searching across all of my buffers. Is there some additional step I can add to make consult-line-multi only search the collected buffers?
 Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a small program in Haskell that allows me to interact with Google's Gemini via Terminal and via VIM.
 It worked for about a week and then, suddenly, every request resulted in a connection timeout.
 At first, I thought the issue was with my API key, or with the fact that I was using a VPN. But while debugging, I've discovered that EVERY SINGLE REQUEST done with http-conduit fails.
 For example: If I open ghci -package http-conduit and run
 parseRequest "GET https://www.facebook.com" >>= httpBS 
 I get a Connection timeout exception.
 It does not matter what website I choose. I should say that CURL has no problem getting the responses, so it is definitely not my internet connection (evidenced by the fact that I'm asking for help here).
 What could be causing this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using math-preview from https://gitlab.com/matsievskiysv/math-preview I enjoy the the fact that no preview images are generated but all math is displayed using mathjax.
 However, I also enjoy using siunitx. Unfortunately siunitx v.3 is not supported by mathjax v.3, or even worse, siunitx.js for mathjax is no longer maintained ( https://github.com/burnpanck/MathJax-siunitx ). As a consequence, equations containing siunitx commands are not displayed using mathjax, e.g. you still see
 \begin{equation}
 \left[ L \right] = \unit{\ohm\second} = \unit{\henry} 
 \end{equation} 
 when previewing.
 Does anybody has some ideas to circumvent the problem by defining some dummy routines substituting the siunitx stuff, e.g. the display could be
 [L] = \ohm\second = \henry
 or just
 [L] = 
 Maybe even a secret siunitx.js v.3 is arround...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had emacs set up as a webdev environment for javascript and php.
 I've got web-mode installed for these languages, and I had lsp-mode running. 
 Earlier this evening lsp stopped working.
 When I would open a php or js file, a message would come up in the minibuffer indicating that the respective language server woudn't start.
 I nuked my emacs config and then I uninstalled and reinstalled the language servers and emacs.
 Then I reinstalled web-mode and lsp.
 But I'm still getting the same issue.
 At the moment my messages buffer has these lines repeating:
  
LSP :: Restarting LSP in buffer test.js
 LSP :: Connected to [ts-ls:49920/starting /home/mantis/tmp].
 LSP :: ts-ls has exited (exited abnormally with code 1)
 Server ts-ls:49920/starting exited (check corresponding stderr buffer for details). Do you want to restart it? (y or n) y
 LSP :: Restarting LSP in buffer test.js
 LSP :: Connected to [ts-ls:49926/starting /home/mantis/tmp].
 LSP :: ts-ls has exited (exited abnormally with code 1)
 Beginning of buffer [6 times]
 previous-line: Beginning of buffer [20 times]
  
So how do I fix this mess?
 I've gotten very used to emacs for js/php and I'd really like to keep using it. But I need these IDE features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone.
 About a year ago, I started noticing random freezing of Emacs when saving files, freezing so long to the point that Emacs starts crashing. They were super annoying as 1) the crashes never saves anything and I lose some of my progress, even with autosaves; 2) they seem to happen frequent enough to notice, yet too sporadic to reproduce and investigate.
 Over a couple months, I ran some bisects and located the issue: it was the GC threshold.
 I tried blindly setting gc-cons-threshold myself and installing GCMH. The problems still persisted.
 I removed the GC setting for quite some time, but the noticeable slowdown during editing made be return to GCMH. With it came back the problem.
 Is there any reason behind this behavior? Is there a way to correct this?
 My Emacs configurations can be found in: here.
 Thanks a ton!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, I'd appreciate some basic assistance. I'm playing around with sum types (or ADTs) of records, and I get this odd bit of behavior.
  ghci> :set -XRecordWildCards ghci> data V = V{x :: Int, y :: Int} | W{a :: Int, b :: Int} deriving Show ghci> testq v@V{..} = v{x = 9} ghci> testq w@W{..} = w{a = 9} ghci> testq x = x ghci> :t testq testq :: p -> p ghci> testq V{x = 1, y = 1} V {x = 1, y = 1} 
 First, I don't know why the type of the function is p -> p rather than V -> V. Second, I don't know why the function fails to change the x value to 9 on the last line. That might simply be my ignorance of how RecordWildCards works.
 In general, are sum types of records a terrible idea? Will things break if some of the records have fields with the same name? I suppose name clashes could be addressed by defining the records separately in their own namespaces, and then putting them all together in the sum type. Finally, if there's a particular reference that would be valuable for better understanding how records work in Haskell, I'd appreciate a pointer. But perhaps the manual is sufficient: https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/records.html
 Thank you.
 EDIT: On a bit of investigation, it appears that you can use the same field in multiple records in a sum type. The bigger issue appears to be when a field is only in one record. You can write code that isn't type safe because it's calling a record selector that works on one record type on a different record type. Unless that's only ghci that lets you do that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm currently using emacs 27.1 at work (cannot install a newer version because we have a old fedora distribution for which no newer emacs exists). And I'd like to use the eshell more. According to this documentation https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eshell/History.html i can search for a last used command by a regex with M-s, which does work. But the cycling through possible other commands via M-n and M-p doesnt work. I can see in a minibuffer, that it is cycling from "history item 27" to "history item 31" etc. but the command is not shown in the eshell. It just shows the first finding.
 Is this an acutal bug or am i getting something wrong? I'd prefer to use as few packages as possible and keep my dependencies low. So i really just need that eshell history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to create a link in my dailies to my present note as soon as a date block (2024-05-23) is existing in my notes. I usually write with org-roam. I must admit, the division between my dailies and other notes is not well done... but it is how I am working now.
 I would like to have the possibility when the point is on a date (for instance 2024-05-22) to create a link in my dailies to the current heading, to the proper daily note if existing, or to a new daily note if not (under a predefined subheading)
 With the help of chatgpt (sorry, no dev here), I have this code:
 ``` (defun my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point () "Create or open an Org-roam daily note for the date at point. If the daily note already exists, add a new heading." (interactive) (let ((date (or (thing-at-point 'date) (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d" (org-read-date nil t))))) (if date (let ((parsed-date (org-read-date nil t date))) (org-roam-dailies-goto-date parsed-date) (when (derived-mode-p 'org-mode) (goto-char (point-max)) (unless (bolp) (insert "\n")) (insert "* "))) (message "No date found at point."))))
 (define-prefix-command 'org-roam-map) (global-set-key (kbd "C-c n") 'org-roam-map)
 (with-eval-after-load 'org-roam (define-key org-roam-map (kbd "d") 'my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point)) ```
 2 problems I see: 1. I want to use a keybinding when the point is on a date to create the link ==> I am not sure the latest part for the creation is OK and that the proper keymap is chosen
  
So far, instead of reading the date at point to create the daily note or insert the link into an existing one, it uses the function org-roam-dailies-goto-date which asks again for a date from the calendar. 
  
how would you improve this function? thanks for your ideas!

 Something similar in javascript - https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk for coloring
 Or I have to code it putting in infinite loop with some time waits or user interuptions ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I believe that the best way to learn a programming language and its strengths is to get your hands dirty.
 So the past few days I have been trying to improve my problem solving skills using Haskell and I am learning a lot. I have mainly been looking at smaller exercises provided by Advent of Code. I believe these open ended problems provide a good basis for practice as I have a lot of freedom but in this freedom is also what I believe to be the largest pitfall as I can easily resort to thought patterns not meant for the functional paradigm. After working through some exercises I went back to Day 3 ( https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3 ) because when I first looked at it I had no clear idea of what Haskell could provide me in order to solve the problem in a streamlined manner, so I skipped …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody, I 'm an emacs noob. Recently I switch to vertico, consult, very happy with that.
 But I can't find the way to create on-the-fly filter with them.
 For example:
 I run find-file then start type into minibuffer: foo
 I will show a list having 4 files has foo
 I want when I press C-c C-m, It would search content of that 4 file, then filter out the files have string bee in it's content. (then the result will only have 2 files)
 Then I could press C-c C-n to reset result tobe 4 file as when I search foo before.
 Is that possible with vertico/consult or I have to use others like orderless, prescient.el?

 A long time ago I used to just use outline-mode and a "one huge text file" approach to this kind of thing.
 I'd about kill to get the asterix indicated outline functionality folded in to wiki-mode.
 I've been a developer for the better part of a half-century, but haven't touched elisp since the 90s.
 How tough is that likely to be? I started cracking in to outline mode to make sense of it, but the code structure is so flat I'm having trouble navigating it.
 Any ideas?

 Hyperbole makes it easy to create fully interactive HTML applications with type-safe serverside Haskell. It's inspired by HTMX, Elm, and Phoenix LiveView
  
Hackage

Motivation
 I've been a web developer since before "Ajax". I rode the wave of Single Page Applications (SPAs) and loved how interactive we could make things. I've written fancy apps in React and Elm. But ultimately SPAs mean writing two applications, a Javascript client and a server, plus an API between them. They're a huge pain to write and maintain. I missed serverside web apps.
 Instead of an SPA, Hyperbole allows us instead to wr…]]></summary>

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I'd love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK and why I'm here:
This forum and my zettelkasten are spaces where I feel comfortable taking risks and trying out new things without the fear of failure holding back. Maintaining a sense of purpose while facing real challenges is crucial. Predicting future developments is a key indicator of expertise in any field. Amateurs react, professionals respond, and masters anticipate.

that definitely was not the case during an internal two-day hackathon Tweag’s GenAI group

As one of our projects, we wanted to develop a tool that would tell us where exactly time
flew to in a given period of time, and so was born work-dAIgest: a Python tool that uses your
standard workplace tools (Google Calendar, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Slack, …) and a large
language model (LLM) to summarize what you’ve accomplished.
In this blog post, we’ll present a proof-of-concept of work-dAIgest, show you
what’s under the hood and finally touch quickly on a couple lessons we learned during this
short, but fun project.

 I wanted to try it on the buffer exercise in 4.6
 ```
 • Using ‘xref-find-definitions’, find the source for the
 ‘copy-to-buffer’ function.
 ```
 so I went to copy-to-buffer. Did M-. and it opened a file finder so basically nothing
 I did C-h f on it, went to the file simple.el
 checked where it is at and it is at `/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/` in my mac
 so I opened a terminal, did
 `etags /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/simple.el.gz`
 saw a TAGS file. checked it and I have a value for copy-to-buffer function
 ```
 (fixi) ➜ lisp cat TAGS | grep -i copy-to-buffer
 (defun copy-to-buffer 6813,291207
 ```
 now I went back to emacs, did M-x visit-tags-table
 added the TAGS file.
 checked
 `M-: (symbol-value 'tags-table-list)`
 and saw the right value `("/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/TAGS")`
 now when I try to do M-. on copy-to-buffer or when I try M-x xref-find-definitions and choose copy-to-buffer I get `user-error: Rerun etags: ‘^(defun copy-to-buffer ’ not found in /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/simple.el`
 what am I doing wrong?

 Regardless, I'm writing some Scheme code for fun and practice, and I realized that when I want to be a fancy pants Rich McGee over here and use λ instead of lambda, it doesn't work in emacs like it would in DrRacket -- which sucks because DrRacket is ugly and emacs is pretty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VSCode and Emacs are both excellent editors, and I use them simultaneously on Windows. However, one annoying point is that the keybinding styles of these two editors are inconsistent.
 For example, in VSCode:
  
Ctrl-z -> undo
 Ctrl-x -> cut
 Ctrl-c -> copy
 Ctrl-v -> paste
  
While in Emacs, Ctrl-x and Ctrl-c keys are used as prefix keys (C-x, C-c) for most of Emacs' built-in commands.
 One way to keep they consistent is to use CUA-mode, but its implementation is quite tricky (e.g., cua-prefix-override-inhibit-delay = 0.2), so I'm not very keen on using it.
 Are there any alternatives to CUA-Mode?
 One possibility I can think of is the Windows Key. 
 For example, 
  
Use the Windows Key on the keyboard as Emacs' Control key, which means that the original C-x prefix can be pressed by the Windows Key (you might say that "the prefix key C-x" now is actually "prefix key s-x", but keep in mind it is handled underhood); 
 At the same time, use the Ctrl key on the keyboard as Emacs' Super Key, which means I can bind custom commands to the Super Key.
  
If this works, I can define a clean "cut operation" like: 
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-x") 'kill-region) ; Note here the `s` is actual Ctrl Key not Win Key (Super Key) on keyboard 
 It won't affect prefix key such as C-x, because C-x is now driven by the Windows key.
 Is this possible in Emacs? Does anyone have experience with this? Or do you have a better solution?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If a beginner haskeller was trying to find the 80-20 rule of category theory concepts in Haskell. What cat theory concepts will form the 20% that will give 80% output (in the sense it can be used to augment Haskell programming in most of the coding scenarios). I wanted to ask this question so they could learn the most useful and commonly used CT concepts first and then simply focus on mastering programming in Haskell after that. They can then come back to cat theory later on. I thought it'd be hard to try to learn both programming and CT together for beginners.

 Unfortunately, either texlab or eglot-ltex is taking precedence depending on the order in my config.
 I was wondering if there is a way to run both of them together for the same buffer. That would be really helpful. Thanks a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use ESS for R and I'm very happy with it. One issue I'm having, though, is that there doesn't seem to be any obvious way to set up a specific R version/conda environment per project. I'm aware of the shell+ess-remote alternative, but it is very clunky. I often need to launch several R sessions per script, and it becomes very annoying.
 Is there any way to tell ESS "for this project use R from this conda environment"?
 Edit:
 this workaround is acceptable for now, I guess:
  (defun ess-remote-auto () (interactive) (setq num (read-number "input: " 1)) (setq env-dir (read-directory-name "input: " "../env")) (when (one-window-p) (split-window-horizontally)) (other-window 1) (let* ((buffer-name (format "*R-%02d*" num)) (buffer (get-buffer buffer-name))) (if buffer (switch-to-buffer buffer) (shell) (process-send-string (get-buffer-process (rename-buffer buffer-name)) (format "conda activate %s \n R\n" env-dir )) (ess-remote buffer-name "R"))) (other-window 1) (ess-switch-process))
