Student Loan Forgiveness is Regressive
Subatomic: Knock on effects of across-the-board loan forgiveness.
Surprising second order effects (Trophic cascade [[201901171252]]) of student loan forgiveness. More children of families in the middle and upper tiers of society go to university and take out loans to pay for it. These families can handle the loan burden. They tend to get larger loans to pay for education. That education lands them high paying jobs where they can afford to pay back the loan. Loan forgiveness favors these upper income people to a larger extent and with a larger amount of money than those less fortunate. This increases rather than decreases the economic gap between social classes.
B-The Other [[202102012019]]

  
Across-the-board forgiveness is therefore a costly and ineffective way to reduce economic gaps by race or socioeconomic status. 1
…Accounting correctly for both human capital and effect of subsidies in student lending plans, almost a third of all student debt is owed by the wealthiest 20 percent of households and only 8 percent by the bottom 20 percent. Across-the-board student loan forgiveness is regressive measured by income, family affluence, educational attainment—and also wealth.1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post may belong better on the KM or AppleScript forums, but I thought I'd ask here first mainly because I bet someone will have a far easier process than I'm trying to build.
After writing a Zettel in The Archive, I want to remind myself to review it in a day, and after that, remind myself for a few days later.  A progressive review kind of thing.
I have a KM macro that:
Prompts me for the number of days, from a pre-made list.
Writes a tag (#ReviewXDays, where X is the number of days) to an inserted 2nd line on the Zettel
Copies the Zettel's h1 (from the 3rd character to the end of the line)
Creates an Apple reminder "Review such-and-such Zettel" with a due date of the number of days out
It all works except the calculated Reminders date at the very end.  I think it must be either a variable type problem, or a syntax problem in the AppleScript.  I have a temporary KM Action before the last step that displays the date I'm trying to use.  If I simply copy that (correct-looking) result and paste it as a constant string in the final KM action, it works.  It just won't accept the variable version of that date.
The error is some variation of "execution error: reminders got an error: can't get date (1/27/2022)", depending on the tweaks I've tried in the script syntax.
Has anyone
created some kind of progressive review automation for themselves that's better than this
worked with pushing a due date to Reminders via AppleScript
The image is of the last few actions, where the "make new reminder" line in the AppleScript is where I fail.

...and here is my KM macro (1st time sharing, hope I do this right):
Add Review Tag
Thank you all.]]></summary>

Or does anyone know if FSF actually does offer the most recent version as a hard copy?
 ​
 This is 1337 pages, so it would likely be hardback (but that's not a requirement on my part - I think some print on demand companies I've used in the past had a requirement that anything above a certain amount of pages had to be hardback, though).

It would mean going to a Windows or Mac machine, spinning up the very slow Dymo label making software, getting the GUI designer right, inserting the label text, printing, and wash-rinse-repeat.
 I wrote a gem to provide a simple command-line program to print labels from a shell. As a bonus, it includes some simple elisp to provide printing the current paragraph from within an emacs buffer as a label.
 This is a bit of a hobby project, written as a Ruby gem, but it eliminated a big hassle for me.
 Here is the link: labrat or install the ruby gem labrat.

 Created as alternative to keycast package that does the same thing in mode-line. I was trying this original package but found that it doesn't behave exactly like I wanted so I created my own from scratch.
 Originally it was also integrated with mode-line but since I'm on newer Emacs version I took the opportunity to move it to tab-bar. I think it's much better that way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most developers choose the path of least resistance. Effect systems are not low resistance and its very hard for experienced functional programmers to explain why its so great. Even ZIO that makes it a little bit more straight forward is still a huge leap from where most programmers are. 
 Compare this to say Rust. Rust requires more from the programmers but the rules around borrowing and lifetimes are relativly easy to understand it takes a while to learn fully. But the motivation is there because its performance and its measurable. Do you want your programms to be 2x+ fast then writ it in Rust.
 Effects systems are very abstract concepts. First that you are describing a program in a program. Then the notion that non purity is bad. Monads, functors etc. There is alot to understand because in the long run you need to understand them.
 I'm currently learning and I like it. Not that I'm fully aware of all benefits but I like learning. 
 When I look at the majority of programmers that I have worked with. They like their job and they program in whatever language they happened to end up with and very few wants to invest in learning a whole new paradigm. It's so hard to get developers to let go of Java 8 some times. Most Java developers have probably never used records in Java. 
 So what am I getting to. I don't know actually :-D just something I have been thinking about. 
 What do you think. Can effect systems ever be mainstream? I can't really see it ever happening if most developers doesn't suddenly become super interested in learning new stuff.
 Also if you believe it can go mainstream how us it going to happen?

Reactivity #Self #Persona
In my experience, dogs respond when people have built a strong persona. It is no different with us humans. People who have a strong persona come across to us as dishonest, insincere, insecure and/or generally untrustworthy.
However, we humans have a special tolerance for people with strong personas because we usually have a personas ourselves. In a sense, we humans play a kind of social poker game and are familiar with the rules. We are, in a sense, talented and skilled at interacting with untrustworthy people. We have the security of being practiced.
Dogs, on the other hand, have no persona. The difference between a publicly displayed mask (persona) and a self hidden behind it is not understandable by them. What t…]]></summary>

 Hello everyone, I am rewriting my dotfiles with org mode. I created this files in my HOME:
 ├── .config
 │ └── shell
 │ ├── aliases.sh
 │ ├── env_vars.sh
 │ ├── functions.sh
 │ └── myrc.sh
 ├── .docs
 │ ├── hooks.org
 │ ├── setups.org
 │ └── shell.org
 └── README.org
 The shell folder have the result of the shell.org tangled blocks.
 README.org will be my master index for all others in docs. In this file I want it to be something like this:
 Here I was able to use the :toc: header arg, but it only worked for the current file.
  
Table of contents (TOC) (README.org) 
 ...
 
 SHELL (here I want to display the shell.org file TOC) 
 aliases (other file link; in the * ALIASES position)
 env_vars (like aliases)
 function (like aliases)
 myrc (like aliases)
 
 HOOKs (TOC of hooks.org)
 ...
 SETUPS (TOC of hooks.org)
 ...
  
-----------------------------------------------------
 I tried including the shell.org summary like this:
  
SHELL 
 #+INCLUDE "./.docs/shell.org::*TOC"
 
  
But this creates a local link with this extructe: [[#header][header]]. I can't click and they don't work on github. I also have to export the file I'm editing so they show up in the current buffer, it would be nice if they show up after I write the changes like :toc: does (if anyone knows how to do this it would be great).
 Manually I can write the links that work as TOC like this:
  
SHELL 
 [file:./.docs/shell.org#ALIASES][aliases]]
 ...
 
  
I could do this manually, but it would be a lot of work and if I updated or modified external files the README.org would not be updated.

 Key combination: type item 1, shift right arrow to change to TODO, alt enter to create additional item, tab to indent item into a child item.
 expected behavior:

Yet, identifying meaningful properties of the system and giving it suitable
inputs may be hard. This is especially challenging for code involving state —
besides properties and inputs, one must also take into account the state of the
system at all times.
It is inconvenient to construct states suitable for testing by hand. An
alternative is to build sequences of inputs that can be iterated over the
initial state, placing the system in a state we want to test. These sequences
of inputs are called traces.
For these traces to be useful for testing, it must be possible to:
report traces to the user in an informative way when some post-condition fails

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately, since switching to using Emacs 28 (using the emacs-plus build), I run into the following issue: when simply trying to open a file, Emacs freezes for a few seconds before doing so. 
 Now: 
  
I've had this happen multiple times when opening a single .el file while visiting a buffer with a different .el file on, so there should be no delay coming from running any mode-related hooks etc, at least as far as I understand these things. 
 I've had this happen long after starting an Emacs session, so any package being loaded with a :defer n call (via use-package) should have been loaded. 
  
I've been trying to use the one tool I sort of knew of for this, explain-pause-mode, but something appears to be wrong with the package but for some reason the package isn't working anymore. I've now had the profiler start by default and tried to look at the profiler report right after I notice the lag, but that hasn't given me any clues. 
 I'm thinking of resetting the profiler every few seconds or so to see if that helps, but I'm wondering if anyone here knows of another way to figure out what's going on. 
 I've been reluctant to bisect my init since as I said before sometimes hours go by without running into this problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's just a short snippet in case you need to browse an SQL dump. It makes the dump more readable by adding field names as comments which can be helpful with tables having lots of fields. It needs to be a dump which contains field names too.
 Here's an example with a trivial table. 
 The original dump:
 INSERT INTO `student` (`id`, `name`, `class`, `mark`, `gender`) VALUES (1, 'John Deo', 'Four', 75, 'female'), (2, 'Max Ruin', 'Three', 85, 'male'), (3, 'Arnold', 'Three', 55, 'male'), ... 
 the converted dump:
 INSERT INTO `student` (`id`, `name`, `class`, `mark`, `gender`) VALUES ( /* id */ 1, /* name */ 'John Deo', /* class */ 'Four', /* mark */ 75, /* gender */ 'female'), ( /* id */ 2, /* name */ 'Max Ruin', /* class */ 'Three', /* mark */ 85, /* gender */ 'male'), ( /* id */ 3, /* name */ 'Arnold', /* class */ 'Three', /* mark */ 55, /* gender */ 'male'), ... 
 The code:
 (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward ") VALUES" nil t) (beginning-of-line) (search-forward "(") (let ((start (point)) fields) (while (not (eq ?\) (char-after))) (forward-sexp) (push (buffer-substring-no-properties start (point)) fields) (skip-syntax-forward ". ") (setq start (point))) (setq fields (mapcar (lambda (field) (substring field 1 -1)) (reverse fields))) (while (progn (search-forward "(") (let ((fields fields)) ;; make a copy (while (not (eq ?\) (char-after))) (insert (concat " /* " (pop fields) " */ ")) (forward-sexp) (if (looking-at ",") (forward-char 1)) (skip-syntax-forward " "))) (looking-at "),"))))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read the emails in my Gmail account in Gnus but I don't store the emails locally, and instead use Gnus's nnimap backend to fetch them. I occasionally want to link to an email from an Org file and want to know how to do it in a robust way. Linking to an email that is still in my INBOX works, but as soon as it expires the link is dead. I thought using gnus-cache-enter-article (bound to *) would instruct Gnus to keep the email around so the link would continue to work, but it doesn't: oddly Gnus still shows the starred email in my INBOX even if it is marked as expired, but the Org link stops working.
 I don't delete any email from my Gmail account so in principle I could have long-lasting links to emails there. I bet somebody has already figured out what to do. I can think of a few possibilities:
  
Maybe there's a way to process the links to point to [Gmail]/All Mail instead, which seem to last longer, but I believe the also stop working after a while (I'm not sure they do, but I have a vague recollection of testing this once, maybe the Gmail IMAP implementation is responsible for the impermanence).
 
Maybe * doesn't keep the links working, but Gnus has several other ways of marking messages to be kept and one of those methods works (I'm no expert on Gnus!).
 
Maybe there's a convenient way to keep locally copies of the messages in another Gnus backend? Like maybe I can copy a message to some other account which I only use for local storage, and link to that copy instead?
 
 Does anyone have a good method for this, using any of those ideas or a different better one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using use-package to manage my packages, and running into a (technically ignorable but suspicious) behavior where, after an update, list-packages tells me that there's a ton of packages that aren't needed and can be removed, and to run package-autoremove to remove them. However, this seems to be almost all of my installed packages.
 Is this a known issue/conflict with Melpa packages/use-package/something else, or is it offering to remove the older versions, or is something messed up?
 It's not a huge issue as I can just.... not answer y to package-autoremove.... but it shouldn't be considering everything unneeded. Plus I guess it prevents me from later removing actually unneeded stuff...
 Anyone else have this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Inspired by Emacs From Scratch I decided to upend my IDE functionality in my config for lsp-mode. LSP starts and is functional, but lsp-ui is shoddy. The sideline functionality and the header breadcrumbs do not work. For me this is not a big deal, but what is bothering me is that lsp-ui-flycheck-list does not work. I need to manually run M-x load-library lsp-ui-flycheck and only then will lsp-ui-flycheck-list show me the list of errors on the page. This leads me to believe there is a loading issue somewhere.
 the relevant init section is this:
 ``` (use-package lsp-mode :straight t :commands lsp :hook ((typescript-mode js2-mode web-mode python-mode) . lsp) :bind (:map lsp-mode-map ("TAB" . completion-at-point)) :custom (lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable nil))
 (use-package lsp-ui :straight t :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode) :config (setq lsp-ui-sideline-enable t) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show-hover nil) (setq lsp-ui-doc-position 'bottom) (lsp-ui-doc-show))
 (use-package lsp-treemacs :after lsp)
 ```
 After startup I do see a few relevant error messages:
 ``` ... File mode specification error: (error The connected server(s) does not support method textDocument/hover. To find out what capabilities support your server use ‘M-x lsp-describe-session’ and expand the capabilities section) Error running timer: (error "The connected server(s) does not support method textDocument/hover. To find out what capabilities support your server use ‘M-x lsp-describe-session’ and expand the capabilities section") LSP :: pylsp:11352 initialized successfully in folders: ...
 ``` Can this be the source of the problem ?
 thx. S

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 I have org files with lots of sections of all sorts (markdown, plain text, code, calculations, directory trees, etc., etc.), some of them within babel #+begin and #+end delimiters, some not. All these sections have some implicit foldable structure. Some have exisiting appropriate language modes, some do not.
 My question is, in coding up custom folding commands for these sections, should I try and base the commands on extending the folding functions provided by org-mode, or should I choose my preferred folding library (of which there are many) and extend it, potentially clashing with org-mode in some way?
 I think I like stateful/persistent folding as in "vimish-fold". I prefer staying within the org-mode buffer rather escaping to a dedicated buffer and returning.
 Any pointers to discussions much appreciated.

 I'm on a quest. I've been travelling for a while. And I might be closing on its end, I feel. With Emacs.
 I have MIDI devices connected to a Macbook. I need Emacs to listen to their MIDI events and insert as text. Simple. Just letters or numbers.
 Google has brought me to these ways:
 - emacswiki, emaccordion, midimacs, midi-kbd : based on ALSA (linux), unavailable in Mac OS X.
 - (make-serial-port) : MIDI devices are generally USB, not serial.
 ​
 Could someone point me in the right direction?

 What I've tried so far:
  
c-mode-hook with lsp-disconnect, lsp-ui, global-flycheck-mode toggle
 with-eval-after-load 'c-mode. The same as above
  
Neither work.
 lsp-disconnect is not available when I call it in my .emacs config for hooking c-mode (but it is for with-eval-after-load, although that still doesn't work).
 Global-flycheck-mode is apparently toggled on even if i turn it off by something.
 I thought, Maybe Lsp is toggling it on? I tried (setq lsp-diagnostics-provider :none) which doesn't seem to make a difference for flychek.
 Even when I disable lsp manually by lsp-disconnect for that buffer, it seems to always come back somehow and re-enable itself even while i just stay editing that single buffer.
 Anyone know how I can have these two disabled at startup but toggleable when needed?

 I start my day by creating a new daily note (with org-roam). Right now it looks like so:
  
[ ] write a journal
 [ ] check slack
 [ ] check important tasks etc
  
What I would like to do is insert various steps based on criteria. For example:
  
at the end of the month, insert - [ ] month review
 at the beginning of the month, - [ ] review personal tasks
  
If for whatever reason I miss the "beginning of the mont" or "end of the month", I want this check list item to appear still. Is there a package out there that does something like this? I'm sure I can come up with custom elisp, but I thought I'd check in before I do that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As react is now the most popular FE framework by a mile (and I and countless others work in it daily), it drives me crazy there's no major-mode for it. I've done a ton of googling and tried a lot of solutions people put online, and I did have some that worked decently well, but none are perfect and the one I was just using broke after an update (like many I've tried before have). I feel like the best solution would be to just write a major-mode for it, it would help keep a lot of web devs on emacs who like the extensibility but are frustrated by the amount of work it takes to just get jsx/tsx to be supported like they are in every other major editor (maybe vim aside, I never use it so I can't say).
 I have some basic emacs experience, I've been using it daily for about 3 years and have fiddled around with some packages and gone through elisp tutorials and even built some dumb programs to play around (like a tic-tac-toe game), but I honestly don't know the first thing about writing a major mode, and while I've read some tutorials on doing so I know people who have experience doing this have a much better idea of what would need to be done, how to break down the work required, and what modern tools (thinking treesitter) could be used to make the syntax parsing, etc much easier.
 I do work full time and am also doing my MBA, but I'd be more than happy to dedicate a night or two a week to get this moving. Unless there's something else out there or someone has started on something, I'd be more than happy to contribute, I just need some guidance on getting up to speed on everything required for a fully-functional major mode. Hopefully this isn't some pipe dream, I feel like with tree-sitter and lsp (and the foundational work already done for other js modes) we could come up with something really solid. Let me know your thoughts, appreciated!

When I inspect exec-path, it contains a version of node that I no longer have installed, i.e. ~/.nvm/versions/node/v17.3.0/bin is in my exec-path, but I only have the most recent stable and lts versions installed (v17.4 and v.16.3.2, respectively).
 So, two questions:
 1 - Naturally, how can I fix this? I've tried using (setenv NODE_PATH ...), but that didn't work. I tried (setq exec-path (append exec-path (file-name-directory (shell-command-to-string "which node")))) but that didn't do the trick either.
 2 - How might this have happened, so I can stop it from happening again in the future?
 Thanks very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I am currently working through a purescript book and really enjoying everything I’m learning! I’m currently working through implementing stock Prelude functions. Apply and flip were easy enough to understand:
 apply :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b apply f x = f x
 flip :: forall a b c. (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c flip f x y = f y x
 Now, for the implementation of applyFlipped, the book implements it as:
 applyFlipped :: forall a b. a -> (a -> b) -> b applyFlipped = flip apply
 So from my understanding, applyFlipped accepts two arguments: a parameter of type a, and a function that accepts a parameter of type a and returns a parameter of type b. Because purescript is implicitly right-associative, that would mean that the function with explicit parameters would read:
 applyFlipped x f = (flip (apply x f))
 My question is: why does the compiler interpret this as flip with parameters apply, x, and f, rather than interpreting it as apply with parameters x and f (which wouldn’t compile), whose result is a parameter for flip?

 It's not a package since most likely you have to adjust it to fit your system and I don't have the capability to make it works for everyone. Also, it has a major drawback that I will mention at the end.
 When you call this command it asks for an input command exactly like Evil. The only difference is that the evaluation of the command is done by vim. This has both advantages and disadvantages.
 Advantages:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen it twice. Both times at financial firms that chose to rewrite entire Scala systems to C++.
 Firm #1 (smaller) decided that it's too hard to hire people who knows Scala, and it was hard for other non-FP engineers to understand Scala code.
 Firm #2 (larger) prototyped, then deployed, a trading system in Scala. Once volume picked up, the decision was made to rewrite to C++ for performance reasons. It was blamed on "idiomatic" Scala which I presume was heavy on immutable data structures.
 So I just wanted to get a lay of the land, have ya'll seen this happen at your companies? Is it common for a rewrite to happen at a certain point in a project's maturity, or have I just been unlucky?

 There is a version 0.4 out for the dtache package. The short description of the package is that it provides the possibility to run commands that are detached from Emacs. To read more see the README here https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache. The major changes compared to the last release is:
  
dtache now integrates with the built in notifications library and this is used as default now for all users
 dtache now uses filenotify to monitor the decoupled processes. This is done for both local and remote commands.
 dtache now fully supports users on macOS
 dtache now is pre-configured with bindings in its minor/major-modes in order to simplify configurations for the users
 dtache is now available on ELPA, MELPA and as a Guix package

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm using doom emacs on macos and trying to define a keybinding to do following using embark and vertico:
  
Say I'm scrolling through a file list (find-file, org-roam-node-find etc).
 I find a file that I may need, I press C-; v and it opens in a new vertical window.
  
Essentially C-x 4 C-f but in reverse order. I want to select the file first and then open it in a vertical or horizontal window (same frame).
 This is what I have so far:
 (map! :map embark-file-map :desc "Open file in v-split" "v" (lambda () (interactive) (+evil/window-vsplit-and-follow) (find-file (embark--vertico-selected))) :desc "Open file in h-split" "h" (lambda () (interactive) (+evil/window-split-and-follow) (find-file (embark--vertico-selected)))) 
 I expected this to let me select and file and then decide weather to open in vertical/horizontal window.
 But I get this error: embark PCH: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil). I understand the error, but don't know how to pass the file name to the find-file function.
 Also is this the correct way to define an embark mapping for doom?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going through "Category Theory for Programmers" and I'm trying to make sense of the author's description of the type Void.
 An excerpt:
  
It’s a type that’s not inhabited by any values. You can define a function that takes Void, but you can never call it. To call it, you would have to provide a value of the type Void, and there just aren’t any. As for what this function can return, there are no restrictions whatsoever. It can return any type (although it never will, because it can’t be called).
  
Then it proceeds to explain that a singleton set is actually type ()
 This doesn't make sense to me - why isn't a function that is the equivalent of { return 32 } the same as a morphism mapping an empty set to a non-empty set? And why can't you call a function whose argument is the equivalent of an empty set? And finally, how is () the equivalent of a set with a single member?
 UPDATE: While typing this, I think it finally clicked - still looking for confirmation. An Empty set can only map to an Empty set because there are no elements to transform. Which is why () is some universal element because it implies that you can map a set with one thing to any one other thing. Is this right?

 Rather recently, I am getting into integrating emacs shell into my workflow. I found that shell works best for me. I tried e-shell but it did not render very well (am I missing something here).
 I would like to improve my shell experience and I was hoping for some help on that front. Specifically. 
  
Using, something like ls in my default shell color codes the directories and files. But shell in emacs doesn't do that. (I am using zsh shell default.) 
 
The shell quotes every command. So typing ls will first print ls then the output. I will like to avoid that. 
 
Somewhat asinine of me, but I tried to invoke nano in side emacs shell. But then I couldn't terminate the process and had to kill the shell. Is there a way around it? 
 
Is it advisable to run tmux in the shell?
 
 Thank you very much for your time and any suggestions towards shell customization is welcome!

 repo/web: https://git.sr.ht/~mplscorwin/emacs-w64
 tl;dr: emacs 28 binary downloads as Installer or ZIP
 The "latest-greatest" is in the "with-native-compilation" folder. Those match what I expect will be Available Soon™ from alpha.gnu.org. 
 These support the native compiler provided a working msys2 installation (with libgccjit, GCC) in PATH. The rest of the dependencies (rsvg, libxml, jansson, ...) are included (unless you grab a "no-deps" version).
 NOTE: the full repo is >5GB; it's likely best to visit the link in a browser, then use the "tree" tab to drill down to and download the file(s) of interest. Full emacs sources are pushed as emacs-28.0.91-src.zip.
 TIA for any feedback and especially reports of breakage, doubly so if you can take the time to send minimal reproducers starting from emacs -Q using ```M-x report-emacs-bug.

 I just want those features that I already have in the vscodium, i love Emacs and the way that it's extensible! (sorry ,English is not my mother tongue).

 So I managed to get majority of what I think my emacs config should look like up and running. Still tweaking things for modern web development (react, ts, etc etc)..
 One thing I miss the most about vim/neovim was telescope and fuzzy finding. Is there a way to have this functionality in emacs? I messed around with counsel-fzf but what I got was fuzzy-finding in the current directory rather than the entire project.. 
 I am trying out helm now and I keep running into this annoying issue when trying to use helm-fuzzy-find. Am I doing things right? Any suggestions on getting fuzzy finding working in emacs where whenever I trigger it, it searches the root project directory??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for the purposes of my final year project I'm writing a non-deterministic language by Haskell for the purposes of learning Haskell and to understand language design! Non-determinism in the language arises in the presence of control flow for example : n := 0 Do (n < 10)-> if P.x -> S [] Q.x -> R fi Od So if any of the guards (P.x,Q.x) are True then their statements S,R can be carried out. The caveat here however is that both of the guards could be evaluated to True which means both statements have to be executed. The branch taken that finishes first however is the branch which ultimately gives the final result so for example if the two guards where checking if n is an even number and if n was less than say five then both branches would have to be taken. ​ After just completing a class on Parallel Computing, my first thought was to use threads but then I came across numerous articles and blogs about how the List Monad can handle non-determinism. ​ So my two approaches where to either use threads which I do have some experience with or to see if the List Monad could actually work. I'm inclined to use threads given that each branch obtains its own instance of the program therefore it would make sense to use them but I am quite aware that Haskell‍ is more or less magic so I figured there's probably another way to achieve the effect I desire. ​ Could something along the lines Lisp's amb be of any use? I found the Haskell implementation https://wiki.haskell.org/Amb but it appears to generally be used for more trivial programs than anything else. ​ My apologies if this post isn't allowed, was just looking to rubberduck a bit

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm new to emacs and I'm having some trouble installing a package. 
 I have the following lines in my .emacs file and the second package doesn't work.
 (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/extensions/emacs-nav-49") (require 'nav) (nav-disable-overeager-window-splitting) (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t) (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/extensions/canvas-emacs-master") (require 'canvas-utils) (setq canvas-baseurl "my-uni") (setq canvas-token "your-canvas-token") 
 However, if I switch the order of them
 (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/extensions/canvas-emacs-master") (require 'canvas-utils) (setq canvas-baseurl "my-uni") (setq canvas-token "your-canvas-token") (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/extensions/emacs-nav-49") (require 'nav) (nav-disable-overeager-window-splitting) (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t) 
 nav stops working, so I assume that something is wrong with the code regarding the second package. Can somebody who is more experienced see if I'm doing anything wrong or does the fault lie with the package itself?

 As you know, when you :reload in GHCI, it only reloads the modules that have changed (themselves or their dependecies, modulo unnecessary TemplateHaskell reloads) since the last :reload. What I've noticed is that when a module doesn't get reloaded, it gets to keep the value of any top-level IORefs too (the value of anything really)!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I switched my persistant scratch to org-mode, my emacs startup time went from less than 1 second to more than 5 seconds.
 With benchmark-init, I found out that the problem comes from org-modules, mostly ol-gnus that takes more than 3 seconds to load.
 Knowing that, as I don't use and don't plan to ever use gnus, eww, or most of the other ol-* things loaded, I want to disable all of them.
 I tried to customize-variable org-modules or (setq org-modules nil) with use-package in :init, :config, :preface, :custom, each separatly or all at the same time, but nothing does the job, I alway have the same default org-modules loaded including ol-gnus and all the others. I also tried with (setq org-modules (delq 'org-gnus org-modules)) as I found in someone's config, or setting a minimal list with (setq org-modules '(org-id ol-info org-protocol)), 
 Do somebody have an idea of how to disable some or all org-modules to load ? Thanks.
 I'm using emacs 27.2 with build-in org 9.4.4.
 Just to prevent some answers, I don't want to use emacsclient or doom to speedup my startup time, I just want to understand why I can't set org-modules the way I want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title. I'm not really sure that Comonad is the answer, because it's dual on how layers can be transformed. F.e. Monad's (join :: Monad m => m (m a) -> m a) ,opposed to comonad's (duplicate :: Comonad w => w a -> w (w a)) and (return :: Monad m => a -> m a) opposed to (extract :: Comonad w => w a -> a). Alas, it's not about whether the value is stored, like in a covariant functor, or is it consumed, like in a contravariant functor.
 Is there any typeclass that allowes this: cobind :: Contramonad c => c b -> (a -> c b) -> c a ?
 And is (would have been) it usefull? I'm asking from theoretical point of view + I'm curious (mostly curious, I don't know much category theory).
 UPD: upon writing this, I wrote the following piece of code, that typechecks
 (>>~) :: (Contravariant w, Comonad w) => w b -> (a -> w b) -> w a wb >>~ f = contramap f $ duplicate wb 
 My own question answered by myself, I guess? The answer is (Comonad + Contravariant).
 UPD: as the wise man in the comments said, no type constructor, that is both Comonad and Contravariant, is inhabited, so my solution is kinda useless.

 Helloo. I am terribly sorry if this is a common knowledge, but I have been unable to find an answer to this question of mine. What I want to achieve is stopping infinite recursion started by a thread, on a timeout. I tried using System.Timeout.timeout, too, and it didn't help. After a bit of googling I found out that recursion can be optimized in such a way that thread in question never yields, so I tried compiling with -fno-omit-yields, and it didn't do anything. I also am compiling with -threaded.
 ```Main.hs module Main where
 import Control.Concurrent (killThread, forkIO, threadDelay) import Control.Concurrent.MVar (newEmptyMVar, putMVar, takeMVar)
 runWithTimeout :: IO (Maybe String) runWithTimeout = do mvar <- newEmptyMVar threadId <- forkIO $ do let res = Just $ show (f 5) putMVar mvar res
 threadKiller <- forkIO $ do threadDelay $ 2 * (10^6) -- 2 seconds killThread threadId putMVar mvar Nothing res <- takeMVar mvar killThread threadKiller return res 
 f :: Int -> Int f n = n * f(n - 1)
 main :: IO () main = do res <- runWithTimeout mapM_ putStrLn res ```
 This is what my cabal file has: .cabal executable test main-is: Main.hs ghc-options: -threaded -fno-omit-yields build-depends: base ^>=4.14.3.0 hs-source-dirs: app default-language: Haskell2010

 Regardless of what IDE I use (VS code or Intellij) even though I have Scala 3 sources jar attached to the code (see config below) still some of the Scala api definition (e.g. 'sliding') takes me to the Scala 2.13.6 sources where I expect it to take me to the Scala 3 sources, why is that happening?
 ​
 config:
 "path": "C:\\....\\Local\\Coursier\\Cache\\v1\\https\\repo1.maven.org\\maven2\\org\\scala-lang\\scala3-library_3\\3.1.0\\scala3-library_3-3.1.0-sources.jar"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I wrote a reactive application in scala, I used Monix's observables and tasks. So the Task IO was basically hard-coded, then I learned about tagless final. Then I learned also there is an alternative called ZIO that exists.
 Questions:
 Does tagless final even make sense in a reactive application where you're mostly using the stream/observable types and not an IO? Since there is no standard type class like Cats IO for streaming, I'm guessing not?
 How does writing a reactive app in ZIO vs Monix compare? What are the abstractions in ZIO for reactive and how do they compare to the observable?

 I look at laziness only as a nice-to-have trick where I occasionally do something like indexedBoom = zip boom [0..], but that's it. I don't quite get what's so PROFOUND about laziness.
 I'm sure there are many things in Haskell that I use all the time that not only utilize laziness but simply would not be possible at all without laziness, but I don't quite grasp what those things are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to create buttons in a pos-tip window, created with the function pos-tip-show-no-propertize.
 This should be possible, as company-quickhelp is using exactly this function to display the temporary help, and in its popup window, I can select text, click buttons, and so on. On the other hand, when trying to replicate this behaviour, its as if the pos-tip window was "floating" above the rest, and I am not able to interact with it. The text is correctly fontified as far as colours, weight, slant ... are concerned, but I can't seem to get my mouse to "interact" with it. 
 As an example, here is a (toy) example that does not work (i.e. I can't click on the links) while using company+company-quickhelp and completing the symbol while shows exactly the same text ... except that the buttons actually are clickable: 
 (let* ((help-buffer (describe-symbol 'while)) (text (with-current-buffer "*Help*" (buffer-string)))) (pos-tip-show-no-propertize text nil nil nil 5 600 600)) 
 I've spent quite some time reading the company-quickhelp and company-capf documentation, and I can't understand what they are doing that I am not doing.

 Who should apply?
 Anyone who meets the following criteria should apply:
  
 Candidates should have enough bandwidth to review merge requests to base on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month), and sustain this for their 3 years term in a healthy manner.
  Candidates should be able to contribute opinions and analysis to issues raised by the community as a part of the CLC proposal process on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month).
  Candidates should be good communicators, and at least be able to articulate to the CLC team when they will be available vs. unavailable.
  Candidates should be productive, and be able to follow through on merge requests and conversations to their completion in a diligent and timely manner.
  
We encourage any and all who satisfy these requirements to apply. Please note that we are not looking for the biggest galaxy brain in the room - quite the opposite. We are looking for productive, motivated individuals who want to help support the ecosystem that we love. As such, we hope to build a broad sample of the community.
 Candidates, who stand for CLC Elections back in September, are most welcome to apply again.
 How can I apply?
 To apply for one of these positions, send an email to core-libraries-committee@haskell.org that consists of the following data:
  
 The header "CLC Election January 2022 - {your name}".
  Why you think you’re a good fit given the above criteria.
  If applicable, please point us to some code you’ve written.
  
Please apply before Feb 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years of being a middlingly-talented web developer, I've learned a dislike of spaces in file names.  I know they are valid in filenames, and are at least addressed in URLs/URIs, but they seem to add just a little fragility to what is otherwise pretty solid without spaces.
I'm about to embrace wholeheartedly the community's recommendation of a unique ID in the filename, followed by the plain English name.  I see the automation benefits of having the (Markdown) h1 in the Zettel being the same as the file name, so that leans me towards accepting spaces.  But one of my goals here is a pretty rigorous future proofing, portability, and stability.
Have you all given this some thought and decided that spaces in file names are just not a problem at all?  If so, my set of files are still small enough that I can swap strategies.

 I should say I've not used any of these frameworks in production. I have some teaching materials based on Happstack that I'd be happy to migrate if there are good technical reasons, otherwise I'll leave well alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Emacs + org-roam for a year. But I recently tried logseq for two weeks. Both are great softwares, and have their strengths and weaknesses.
 I'd like to share my thoughts, and see what you think.
 ​
 Pro for Emacs:
  
Unparalleled editing experience.
 Great support for tables, org-babel, etc.
 Highly customizable. Writing an elisp function is a lot faster than writing a plugin.
 A long history, a strong community. I'm really impressed how many great changes happen every year.
  
Cons for Emacs:
  
Bad support for multimedia, and I see little hope that this will be solved. (eaf might be a solution but I use macOS instead of Linux)
 Had to write many configs myself. Although I've made it comfortable for myself now, I think I'd have to throw more effort at it in the future.
  
​
 Pros for Logseq:
  
Modern UI (it is not a clear win compared to emacs though)
 User-friendly note-taking. And I don't have to maintain my config. For example, using [[page]] to reference or create another page, viewing all journals in one page, etc.
 More note-taking related functions. For example, Zotero support, taking notes with, NLP (not yet, but in their roadmap), etc.
 FLOSS!
  
Cons for Logseq:
  
Hard to migrate. The format is too customized. But I think it is a common problem for doubly-linked note systems.
 Org-mode support is not that great. Inter-operatability is not as good as expected.
  
​
 There are also different considerations w.r.t. note taking:
  
When pressing enter, Logseq insert a new node as default instead of a newline as in Emacs.
  
​
 To me, Logseq seems to be a very modern and promising note system, while Emacs remains a lot more reliable. It is really hard to choose between those two.

But recently i gave notion a try. While I am not at the level of those who make YouTube videos on how they use notion and I think that it is a little too extremist I have come to like the ability view/edit/add notes from multiple devices. Usually I used to use org only on my laptop but recently I have acquired quite a few devices and I want the ability to be on sync with devices. 
 I am curious how people sync/view/add notes or org between laptop/tablet/iPhone? Also anyone who converted from Org to Notion or vice versa what are your thoughs? Thanks

 Currently I'm specializing in Python web development, and I resigned from my job a couple of months ago to become a freelancer, but, I was just curious, currently as of 2022 what is the state of Haskell in industry?
 Is there more Haskell job openings?
 Are companies looking to hire Haskell freelancers?
 Any statistical graphs to show if Haskell is growing or not?
 Anyways, I was just wondering. I'm going to learn Haskell and do a bunch of personal Haskell projects as a hobby for now, but it would be motivator for me to learn even more Haskell if more Haskell jobs opened up in industry.
 Currently, languages like Python have a lot of job openings, that's why I'm spending most of my time with Python, but I'm also very interesting in getting back into pure lazy functional programming.
 Thanks in advance!
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started using org-gcal and I had noted two things about its current functionality that were bothering me and wondered if there was already a solution implemented:
 1) It seems that the only way I can send my scheduled task from my org mode file to google calendar is to use org-gcal-post-at-point at a specific header in the org file. This works for individual tasks in the org file, but this is quite cumbersome if I wanted to upload my entire org file's scheduled tasks. I tried org-gcal-sync-buffer when I was in the org file, but it only uploaded the individual tasks that already had the org-gcal property to the calendar and ignored the other scheduled tasks. Is there a solution to upload everything in the org file at once?
 2) I was wondering if a solution had already been implemented for dealing with recurring tasks in org mode and being implemented into the calendar yet? It seems like this is something others had wanted but I did not see any solutions.
 Thanks

 Sometimes, my agenda view shows a series of question marks where usually I'd see the name of the org file the item comes from. Just now, I was viewing my agenda and noticed that items coming from one of the files in my `org-agenda-files shows these question marks at the beginning:

 I can call org-agenda-switch-to from that item and I'm sent to the right file. Something appears to be corrupt, but I do not know what that is. 
 Any clues?

I'm adding the ability to import from any browser accessible org-mode file (eg a url like https://braintool.org/topicTrees/PersonalProductivity.org ) however I'm finding that there are .org ending urls such as https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown/-/blob/master/doc/Tool-Support.org which are html documents generated from org, rather than plain text org, so I can't parse them.
 Am I safe just adding special case handling for github and gitlab? Any thoughts on some other way to handle this?

It's a normal part of my work -- during extensive find-replace sessions, I move brackets to their own lines to give me space (eg for rectangle operations and macros). I then manually go through my file and put them all back on their own lines as a final clean-up. It's this last bit that I'd like to automate, but searching online and investigating the likely libraries like Smart Parens, I don't see exactly this. Does anyone know a library, or have a handy function, that can automate this cleanup step?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just as the standard Monad laws look simpler from another angle, it seems that the Applicative laws do too. I don't think I can be the first person to notice this formulation. Does anyone know where it was written down before? Specifically, the standard Monad laws are
 return a >>= k = k a m >>= return = m m >>= (\x -> k x >>= h) = (m >>= k) >>= h 
 and the simpler formulation is
 return >=> f = f f >=> return = f (f >=> g) >=> h = f >=> (g >=> h) 
 The standard Applicative laws are
 pure id <*> v = v u <*> pure y = pure ($ y) <*> u pure (.) <*> u <*> v <*> w = u <*> (v <*> w) pure f <*> pure x = pure (f x) 
 and the simpler formulation is
 pure id <.> f = f f <.> pure id = f f <.> (g <.> h) = (f <.> g) <.> h pure f <.> pure g = pure (f . g) where (<.>) = liftA2 (.) 
 (I'm skeptical whether the last law (the "homomorphism law") is actually needed. Feels like it should be derivable from the others, but that's an investigation for another day.)

 instead I see Int defined as

 which must somehow be creating `Int as above "virtually." Or am I wrong about that? In any event can someone give me some details? Here's a statement that got me on this trail

The first step to realise is that all literal numbers in Haskell are constructors that construct some instance of the Num typeclass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Org-roam is a great tool and I love it. Having using it for more than a year, I have almost made 5,000 nodes out of it.
 (length (org-roam-node-list)) ; => 4900 
 It doesn't take much time to generate that list (yet), but the following functions that map over the resulting list take more and more time. The following is the profile report when I try to insert a node More than half of the time, mapcar is busy applying a lambda to each element in the long list.

 So what now? Is there a way builtin to solve this? If not, I will try to hack it. But I don't want to hack the code base either.. any advice?

 I use Emacs on two computers - my main MacBook Pro and a "server" Mac that I connect to via mosh from my iPhone and iPad. I keep my org files on iCloud Drive and the sync works.
 global-auto-revert-mode also works - if I keep the same file open on both computers, I can see the changes appear on one machine when saved on another, so it obviously works.
 However, it doesn't seem to update inactive buffers in the background. So, if I refresh my agenda, the changes do not get reflected unless I switch to the buffer with the changed file and then rebuild the agenda.
 Maybe Emacs doesn't auto-revert inactive buffers unless you switch to them? If that's the case, is there any quick way to force org-agenda to reopen all org buffers on refresh?
 I tried to google it but haven't found anything useful. Am I missing something obvious?

 Title says it, need help:)
 I have block of text similar to this:
 " KC_EXLM, KC_AT, KC_UP, KC_DLR, KC_PERC, KC_PGUP, KC_7, KC_8, KC_9, KC_BSPC,"
 And i want to replace all "KC____" with "_____,"
 This regex should work "KC.{7}", and online tester shows 9 matches, but it does not work in emacs. I tried "KC.{7}", "/KC.{7}/", "/KC.{7}/gm"- 0 matches.
 What am i doing wrong?
  
UPDATE: As per cazzipropri's advice used re-builder and solved with "KC......."
 It might be good idea to switch to https://github.com/benma/visual-regexp-steroids.el/ for emacs regex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I have two different emacs configurations in my home directory. I'm using chemacs (not chemacs2) to switch between them, with emacs 28.0.90:
  
~/.noivy-emacs.d/ -- The one I mainly use.
 ~/.beginemacs.d/ -- A new one, that I'm hoping to turn into a simple configuration and tutorial combination for beginners.
  
My problem is that there is now a third emacs directory, ~/.emacs.d/, which contains folders, belonging to a mixture of the two configurations:
  
~/.emacs.d/auto-save-list/ has auto-save lists from both configurations. I found a problem in the variable auto-save-list-file-prefix. Here's a snippet from C-h v. I don't know why it's getting changed away from emacs-user-directory towards .emacs.d.
  
``` auto-save-list-file-prefix is a variable defined in ‘startup.el’.
 Its value is "~/.emacs.d/auto-save-list/.saves-" Original value was "~/.noivy-emacs.d/auto-save-list/.saves-" ```
  
~/.emacs.d/elpa/ has packages installed using package.el using the ~/.beginemacs.d/ configuration. (The other config uses straight.el which puts packages in the right place.) They were also changed somehow away from emacs-user-directory towards .emacs.d.
  
``` package-user-dir is a variable defined in ‘package.el’.
 Its value is "~/.emacs.d/elpa" Original value was "~/.beginemacs.d/elpa" ```
  
~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/ has the eln-cache for both configurations. This one seems to be set by C source code to have nothing to do with emacs-user-directory. Any ideas how to change this?
  
``` native-comp-eln-load-path is a variable defined in ‘src/comp.c’.
 Its value is ("/home/ben/.emacs.d/eln-cache/" "/usr/lib/emacs/28.0.90/native-lisp/") ```
 I would like each configuration to be completely contained in its directory, because this is a mess. Any ideas?

 I want to upgrade one project to Scala 3.1, but I'm using the macro heavy chimney (https://github.com/scalalandio/chimney) to reduce the boilerplate, which is not available for Scala 3 yet. My idea was to copy and paste the code that chimney generates on 2.13, and after that uncomment the uses of chimney for now.
 Is it possible to get the code which is generated by chimney in a runnable form instead of IR (ValDef, TermTree etc.) like when using -Ymacro-debug-lite? Idealy only for a single file? The output of -Ymacro-debug-lite was gigantic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow Haskellers,
 today I released new version of headroom, this release (release notes) brings support for managing license/copyright headers in Dart, Kotlin and PHP source code files. Also it fixes annoying issue in copyright year updater feature and finally makes headroom fully compilable with GHC 9 (9.0.2 or newer).
 In case you never heard of headroom - it's small command line utility that manages license/copyright headers in your source code files. All needed is to create Markdown templates for license/copyright, fill-in some variables and that's it. It can also do some nice stuff like above mentioned feature that updates years in copyrights for you. Also some languages have extended support, where for example in Java/Scala/Kotlin files you can use class package name as template variable, and in Haskell it can even extract and reuse variables from whole Haddock module header. This release also automatically checks for new versions once per week and notifies user to command line (using this GitHub REST API) - no data collection or telemetry bullshit is happening), but if you don't like it, it can be easily disabled in configuration.
 Headroom is already few years out, but I'm always happy to hear ideas about new features or improvements, feel free to open new issue or PR in such case.

 The reason of this: I want to get inspiration on usage of Monad implementations that actually require for correctness, for example, associativity of bind. 
 The simple examples I can think of don’t strictly require monad properties. Maybe something along the lines of monad transformers or effects, but I still can’t clearly see the need. Maybe the sequence function? Or maybe this is more of theoretic interest to prove function properties/uniqueness? I’d love to read your insight on this.

 I just wanted to share a way to use various directories with org-roam, for work, study etc.
 I can't remember where I found this config, but so far it works with zero problems for me. I just added my templates to it.
 ​
 So here is a quick overview of how I set it up (I don't know if all the steps are necessary, but they worked for me):
  
I created a git repo for my notes and cloned it to my machine at /home/user/Documents/roam.
 Inside the roam folder, I created my subdirectories; for this example, lets say we would like 2 roam folders: work and study.
 Inside each of those 2 folders I put a templates folder, so now the file tree looks like this: 
 roam/work/templates;
 roam/study/templates;
 
 Inside the templates folders I put all of my org templates for my notes.
 And at last …]]></summary>

 I have a huge org-mode file (over 10K lines) and now I find that org-mode frequently writes to disc, to the point of causing a lag in the prompt availability. 1s adds up!
 I've tweaked the auto-save-interval variable (it's now 600) but this doesn't seem to influence this behavior. 
 write-region-inhibit-fsync is set no nil (default) because the manual says it safer?
 Any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to use Vollkorn as the variable-pitch-font, and it shows but I can't change boldness or size, no matter what keywords I try. For example:
 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :subfamily 10.0) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Vollkorn" :height 100.0)) 
 :height does not seem to change anything, I similarly tried with :size. I also tried :weight 'normal but it's still some kind of bold/semibold default value. 
 I also tried describe-font on the default Vollkorn settings, which I found to be "Vollkorn:pixelsize=24:foundry=NONE:weight=normal:slant=normal:width=normal:scalable=true" I figured that this was what I was looking for, and tried
 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :subfamily 10.0) doom-variable-pitch-font "Vollkorn:pixelsize=50:foundry=NONE:weight=normal:slant=normal:width=normal:scalable=true") 
 To try to increase the font size, but no change. How do you figure these things out? Fonts in emacs have always been a major source of confusion for me. Keywords that work for one font do nothing for another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using org-roam for some time now and have a collection of multiple org files which are org-roam nodes stored in a folder called ~/Roamnotes. While capturing notes, I have setup org-roam to directly write to *.org.gpg files so that they get encrypted upon creation. Emacs uses EasyPG Assistant to encrypt and decrypt files automatically. So during my routine org-roam-node-find operation where I am trying to open one of the org-roam nodes (or files), EasyPG starts automatically decrypting all the nodes in my org-roam folder. This is normal and logical.
 My problem: The process of decryption is quite slow and I think could be handled by multi-processing the decryption of nodes via an external program or if possible in an async way.
 ​
 Is there a way to do this better? My roam notes collection is growing bigger and bigger and I fear that there might come a point where I might have to start the org-file decryption, take a nap and come back to it once I am awake.
 It is important for me to store my roam notes encrypted as I use them on my work and my personal computer (synced via syncthing) and it contains some quite sensitive information. One option I thought was to only encrypt files with sensitive information and keep the rest open, but this adds an overhead of always keeping in mind what I want to encrypt and what not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a complex function which jumps around the buffer a lot and inserts text which does not work with save-excursion as the point always moves to the same place in the buffer afterwards.
 So 
 (save-mark-and-excursion (my-complex-function)) 
 does not return the point to its original location. However
 (let ((point-pos (point)) (my-complex-function) (goto-char point-pos)) 
 does work, and wrapping it in a macro
 (defmacro my-save-excursion (&rest body) `(let ((point-pos (point))) ,@body (goto-char point-pos))) 
 seems to work fine as well. How is this different from save-excursion, and is there a more idiomatic or built-in way of handling this?

 I use show-paren-mode to highlight matching parentheses, which works perfectly in all programming modes. However, for some reason, in org-mode, ( is also matched with >. This really messes things up in src-blocks as the matching is totally de-synced. Any helps/tips/comments on how to approach this weirdness will be very welcome!

I have no idea how that happened, but manually changing the encoding to utf-8 (I had to use vi for that, since I could not figure out how to do this in Emacs) fixed the issue. I leave the question below in case anyone is in a similar position, but I'll mark it as 'Solved'.
 ​
 I'm having a very hard time figuring out what the culprit here is, so please bear with me.
 I start emacs by calling emacs -q --no-site-lisp, set the value of org-agenda-files to what I normally have it set to, add an item with a special character scheduled for today to one of the agenda files, and then call org-agenda. As expected, I see the item displayed on the agenda with the special characters, say:

 If I mark the item as done on the Wednesday, the items increment to the below:

 As you can see, both the Wednesday and the Saturday entries increment by a week.
 How can I have it so that marking the item as done on Wednesday increments only Wednesday's entry and not also Saturday? (and vice-versa)
 I know I can make two separate events -- one for each day -- but that feels a little inelegant.

 TLDR: what is the command to add another tag to a heading that already has one or more tags?
 ​
 TL: the command org-set-tags-command (C-c or C-q as expressed in the manual in https://orgmode.org/manual/Setting-Tags.html) adds a tag to a heading. 
 However, when you already have tag(s), this command replaces them with the new selected one instead of adding it. 
 I didn't customize anything that may seem related, nor I found anything in the documentation or web about a command to add a new tag to a set of existing ones. Surely I'm approaching it with a non-adequate approach or keywords... 
 Can anyone point me to the documentation, or examples about how to add tags preserving existing ones? 
 As always, thanks a lot for sharing your time and attention. :)

 n = 10^8 -- Arbitrary big number let (a,b) = partition even [0..] in (a!!n,b!!n) (\(a,b) -> (a!!n, b!!n)) (partition even 0..) 
 In theory, it seems like lines 2 and 3 should function the same way. However, there is a difference. 
 Executing line 2 uses virtually no additional memory, but a and b are computed separately (there is a noticeable delay between the first value being printed and the second value being printed).
 Executing line 3 computes a and b at the same time, but has a memory overhead proportional to n. For sufficiently large n, the process runs out of memory and terminates.
 What is the explanation for the observed difference in behavior between let-in and function application?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For my case, i recently re-implemented an old Go code of an event gateway rest API with Scala + Akka HTTP. The reason is that we are a data engineering team, and none of us are familiar with Golang stack. We re-code it to improve maintainability.
 The logic is extremely simple, the HTTP server just listens for POST requests, based on the extract the payload in raw bytes and forward to Kafka. There are mappings of 1:1 between the URI and Kafka topic so that we know where to forward the events, something like https://blah.com/api/v1/app_events -> app_events Kafka topic. These mappings are fixed and provisioned from a config file.
 Previously, with the Go (Gin) version, with 1 Core, we are able to reach 2.5K RPS. Now, with the Akka HTTP version, we could not go higher than 1.1K RPS.
 The Akka HTTP version is 10.2.7.
 Initially, we thought It could be the Kafka producer that slows the server down, but it wasn't, without the Kafka producer, RPS did not improve.
 Is this a valid outcome? That we have to accept that Go(Gin) is >2x faster than Akka HTTP?
 ==== Updated =====
 I was just performed another loadtest because I suspected at my usage of optionalHeaderValueByName directive. This time, I held down the CCU setting from Locust side to 500 as I wanted to see how much CPU it cost in each case.
  
With optionalHeaderValueByName: cost ~ 380m CPU.
 Without optionalHeaderValueByName: cost ~ 270m CPU.
  
This turned out the header extraction directive contributes significantly to CPU cost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are your thoughts on a „Zippable“ typeclass?
 Motivation: Many functions previously only defined on lists are being moved into typeclasses. For example, since base 4.8.0, we have elem and length in Foldable.
 There is also a discussion around moving Foldable1 into base to generalize foldl1, foldr1 and the strict versions thereof.
 I think zip and zipWith would also be great candidates for doing this.
 Many containers already define there own version of these functions, so I think adding this new typeclass in base would generalize the definition of some functions using zip to work for other containers without importing conflicting definitions.
 The definition should probably look something like this:
 class Functor f => Zippable f where zip :: f a -> f b -> f (a, b) zip = zipWith (,) zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c zipWith f a b = fmap (uncurry f) (zip a b) zip3 :: f a -> f b -> f c -> f (a, b, c) zip3 a b c = zipWith ($) (zipWith (,,) a b) c unzip :: f (a, b) -> (f a, f b) 
 Note: This code is missing some functions. zipN up to N=7 should probably be included. Also unzipN and zipWithN.
 Would love to hear your opinions on this.

I don't know how to reproduce this either, it just works when it wants to.

 EDIT: I'm running Org version 9.5.2, and Emacs version 29.0.50, the latest build from Master
 EDIT 2: I uninstalled the compiled version, reinstalled Emacs 27 from the Frdora repos, and <s TAB worked fine. It was expanded to #+BEGIN_SRC and #+END_SRC. I then uninstalled it, reinstalled the compiled version with sudo make install, and it worked. I didn't change anything. I'm not sure how to debug or reproduce this, as it seems to be finicky.

steadily innovated with language extensions and abstractions. To mention
a few, we had the IO monad, all flavors of type classes and constraints,
Template Haskell, generalized algebraic data types (GADTs), data kinds, etc.
Then we had to deal with the programs resulting from all this innovation,
which eventually sprang feelings that ranged from sticking to
Simple Haskell to supporting full motion towards
Dependent Haskell.
There seems to be two design goals at conflict in current discussions.
On the one hand, we want our programs to be easy to maintain. For
instance, changes to one part of the code shouldn’t propagate to many
others, and the meaning of a piece of code should remain reasonably
deducible from the text.

 I thought I'd try to make a nice HTML content type for servant using mustache templates.
 I have a version that works.... but it uses unsafePerformIO because it has to load the templates from disk.
 The mustache library provides a way to load templates at compile time, which I like the idea of! But I can't seem to be able to pass the template file name to the ExpQ function (I get it as a known symbol).
 Both options have made me hit my knowledge limit. I have no idea how to grab a known symbol as a string in template haskell, nor do I know if my unsafePerformIO will screw me in the future.
 Can anyone shed some light on these two points?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning scala and I like a lot of its syntax choices, but I don't really understand the utility of placeholder syntax in functions.
 Instead of val increment = (x: Int) => x + 1
 Apparently you could write val increment = (_: Int) + 1
 Or even more cryptically can apparently use a similar syntax for multiple variables like:
 val add: (Int, Int) => Int = (x1, x2) => x1 + x2 
 To something like:
 val add: (Int, Int) => Int = _ + _
 I can't really imagine what advantage there is to placeholder variables. Any opinions or best practices on what this language feature is used for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have an app with a Scala backend and a Scala.js frontend. They communicate via autowire, later changed to sloth for better ergonomics. (For those unfamiliar, macros generate code which takes care of serializing/unserializing arguments using upickle or boopickle or whatnot, and gives you a nice typesafe API to call back into your app without the usual ajax boilerplate).
 I would like to upgrade to Scala 3 and it seems the blockers for me are these heavily macro-based autowiring libraries. Boopickle seems to support Scala 3 by now (though not chameleon which sloth uses to abstract away boopickle).
 Since Scala 3 should enable this kind of functionality without the headache inducing macro code required on 2.x, what would people recommend as a Scala 3 solution for client-service communications, with as little boilerplate as possible, and ideally using boopickle (it's much smaller than the equivalent json and I like the obfuscation) ?
 It's all Scala front-to-back, no need to care about any other language or format, and I'm not opposed to switching it all out in order to move to Scala 3.
 Thank you for any suggestions.

It exists in every other modern IDE, GUI Application and is so extremely efficient. Even more if you can use it to look up key chords and function-names through it. 
 Which-key and helm even with "helpful" activated does not provide the discoverability that a context-menu can provide. Both offer functionality from a root node that is not narrowed down and you have to already know a function name or key chord as a intro to start. 
 A hierarchical context menu provides narrowing based on functionality in a dwim style. It is like the menu bar but in a specialized /narrowed context.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just recently read about STM's and wanted to seek advice on correctness and good practices.
 Suppose we have a ChatSession defined as below:
 type Message = (UUID, Text) data ChatSession = ChatSession { sessionID :: UUID , clientConns :: Map UUID WS.Connection , chatHistory :: Seq Message , ... -- some more fields } 
 My question concerns modifying chatHistory a sequence of all messages sent within a ChatSession. If we were to use TVar on chatHistory, we have the following:
 updateChatHistory :: TVar (Seq Message) -> Message -> STM () 
 But what if we wanted to operate on ChatSession itself? Then we could have
 updateChatHistory :: TVar ChatSession -> Message -> STM () 
 Where inside it, the actually appending of a Message to the chatHistory remains a pure operation on Seq.
 Which of the two makes more sense? To make a more general question, I guess, should I split my data structure among multiple TVar's, or have the entire data structure be a TVar where mutations to individual fields remain pure?
 I'm still a beginner, so please let me know if I'm not using correct terminologies here and there. Thanks so much in advance!

For every new character until n characters, no completion
 At the n-th character, asynchronously query function for completion candidates
 For every subsequent key such that the first n characters have not changed, narrow completion candidates
 When the first n characters have changed, asynchronously query function again
 
When the number of characters goes below n characters, no completion
 This should be similar to grep; is there a simpler example that I can follow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Google gives me nothing, I wanted to ask whether anyone else is experiencing this strange behaviour before I file a bug report.
 Usually, helm and tramp work together without any additional configuration. But there is one (very common) instance where they fail me:
 For simplicity, say I have a file, /foo, on a server called remotehost. I also have a symlink /bar -> /foo on the same server. I now do an M-x helm-find-files RET /ssh:remotehost:, at which point I am prompted for credentials.
 Helm now opens the root directory of remotehost, and I type bar. The helm buffer correctly selects the only available candidate.
 I now type RET (or C-j) and am greeted by a system beep and the message:
 Trying to exit with no candidates
 The file does not open.
 All three other combinations work – opening remotehost:/foo directly in helm, opening remotehost:/bar via tramp without helm, and opening local symlinks in helm are all fine.
 Am I the only one seeing this error? I am on emacs 27.2 on GNU/Linux.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to specialize cl-defmethod on a string=, but am having a hard time understanding how to write a specializer method. Does anyone know how to structure these things? I imagine it's just a wrapper around string=, but the built in specializers are a bit more complex than that.
 Edit: Here's what I am hoping to achieve with methods:
 (cl-defmethod print-if-hello-world ((string (equal "hello world"))) (format string)) 
 Evaluating this gives Unknown specializer (equal "hello world")
 So I would like to add the specializer to cl-defmethod

 Example:
  
level 1
 default line spacing (5) 
 spacing above should be 7
 spacing above is 5
 
  
I want items on the same level to have the default line spacing (5), but want items on different indentation levels to have some extra space between them. Currently I'm achieving a similar effect by adding a new line between indentation levels.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I'm using files in a directory with org files, I have a bunch of backup I think files that show up with weird names mirroring my open files. I don't see this for non-org files (or maybe I'm not looking hard enough since I mostly use emacs for org). The /org directory is mounted from my NAS and I'm on Linux. Here's what the files look like, where I only want the normal .org files:
 helm-find-files
 [?] .#inbox.org [?] .scratch.org inbox.org scratch.org 
 Dired
 ?????????? ? ? ? .#inbox.org -rw-rw-rw- 1 137K Jan 17 06:01 inbox.org 
 ls -ltrah
 ls: cannot access '.#inbox.org': No such file or directory ls: cannot access '.#scratch.org': No such file or directory total 1.7M ?????????? ? ? ? ? ? .#scratch.org ?????????? ? ? ? ? ? .#inbox.org -rw-rw-rw- 1 owner owner 137K Jan 17 06:01 inbox.org -rw-rw-rw- 1 owner owner 94K Jan 17 13:42 scratch.org 
 edit: on my NAS, the files show like this:
 lrwxrwxrwx 30 owner 3 Jan 14:11 .#scratch.org -> owner@laptop.1131587:1240922021 
 Do you have any idea what's causing those files or how to stop it? Or at least how, in helm-find-files and dired how to remove/filter them so I don't see them?

 I have been running emacs-jupyter (link) for a while now with no problems whatsoever. Yesterday, I moved to a daemon-client setup with the same config, and emacs-jupyter does not load at all. I have submitted a more detailed issue here. I am also asking on here to ensure that I am not doing something blatantly silly, and for which I do not need to bother the awesome package-dev.
 The relevant part of my configuration is:
 (use-package jupyter :ensure t :after org) (with-eval-after-load 'org (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((emacs-lisp . t) (python . t) (jupyter . t)))) 
 Has anyone faced a similar problem at some point? Any tips/comments/suggestions are very welcome! Thanks.

 Has anyone gotten this working? I tried googling and everyone seem to not have this issue since I found no answers (might also be my googling that is terrible)

 do you have any solution to see the magit regions well in the doom-theme ?
 What I mean is that there is no good readable header in the active section and the highlighted line is become a highlighted text. I think the not active section is more readable then the active one.
 It is in the status page when you check the differencies.

auto completion (while lsp works, I've found it to be "heavy" and bloated, I just need simple autocompletion)
 auto indent after return
 compiling and running files with a single stroke
 vim keybinds (evil works perfectly – no extra config needed)
 linting (i think flycheck is light enough but not sure)
 something like ivy/helm for C- and M-x completions (both are too heavy for the purpose) \n\n
  
Please recommend packages/resources for the above, the focus should be on speed and efficiency since I already have a full doom config.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there, I'm trying to understand how to use the logict https://hackage.haskell.org/package/logict
 I understand the examples and how it works with basic variables, but I don't manage to use it with a more complex model.
 I'm trying to apply it on a Sudoku-like model, first applying the constraint on the rows :
 ```haskell import Data.Map ((!)) import Data.Map.Strict (Map) import qualified Data.Map.Strict as Map import qualified Data.Set as Set
 type Pos = (Int, Int)
 type Sudoku a = Map Pos a
 numbers :: [Int] numbers = [1 .. 9]
 newSudoku :: Sudoku (Logic Int) newSudoku = Map.fromList [((r, c), choose numbers) | r <- numbers, c <- numbers]
 rows :: [[Pos]] rows = [ [(r, c) | c <- numbers] | r <- numbers]
 getAll :: Ord k => Map k v -> [k] -> [v] getAll m ks = [m ! k | k <- ks ]
 problem :: Sudoku (Logic Int) -> Logic (Sudoku Int) problem s = do s' <- sequenceA s guard $ and (allDiff . getAll s' <$> rows) pure s'
 allDiff :: [Int] -> Bool allDiff xs = length xs == (Set.size . Set.fromList) xs
 showSudoku :: Sudoku Int -> String showSudoku s = unlines [unwords [show (s ! (r, c)) | c <- numbers] | r <- numbers]
 choose :: [a] -> Logic a choose = foldMap pure
 main :: IO () main = (putStrLn . showSudoku) $ observe (problem newSudoku)
 ```
 This usage is probably naive, the program runs forever. I'm not convinced about the sequenceA usage, put it there to typecheck and be able to write my constraint.
 I also tried another approach where I traverse the Map, trying to put a constraint on each cell, but I don't manage to insert a variable into the different 3 constraints (rows, columns, square).
 My conclusion is I don't understand the library usage, how would you solve this kind of problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read in multiple places that the Haskell FFI is particularly fast. For example, this blog post on BigInt benchmarks points out:
  
Finally, GHC uses GMP, and its performance is nothing short of extraordinary. GHC is clearly tuned to call into GMP with extremely low overheads.
  
If you look at the numbers in the FFI overhead benchmarks, Haskell's overhead is almost the same as other systems languages, and much lower than other GCed languages.
 What's the secret sauce behind this result?
 I've started reading Extending the Haskell foreign function interface with concurrency; do y'all have any reading recommendations, such as parts of the source code, apart from this one?

 Hello everyone, this is my first Emacs package, a just for fun project I created for improving my elisp knowledge. Used it at your own risk.
 Enime is a sort-of elisp re-implementation of ani-cli using the same video scrapping methods but featuring a transient based TUI, because, subjectively, transient is a better UI than a CLI.

However, it appears that because of it, when I press the Tab key at the beginning of the lines, then don't indent. Instead, the cursor just goes to the beginning of the next word. Is there a way to use Tab for indenting lines (by inserting chosen number of spaces in the setting before the line beginning), while using cdlatex? 
 Thank you.

 I tried reading the paper (The Essence of Dependent Object Types) and watched the "Rock the JVM" talk about it. The basic example I see over and over is something like this:
 trait Record { type Key } def getIdentifier(r: Record): r.Key 
 What makes that better than
 trait Record[Key] { } def getIdentifier[Key](r: Record[Key]): Key 
 ? 
 I could see an argument that option 2 is clearer to someone who understands generics/comes from a Java background. 
 Would also appreciate any other examples where path dependent types do cool things!

 Typically, I just use my 'dotfiles' repo, and pull it down to a ~/home/(username)/hub folder, and then use 'GNU Stow' to just stow each folder with:
 stow -t ~ (name of dotfile folder)
 I wish I knew how to do this recursively, since its a bit tedious, but I do like how stow works in relation to dotfiles since I can't find anything just as useful. 
 Also, I use a one-way mindset meaning only one single computer has access to changing dotfiles so I don't mess anything up locally and have to go through git hell to figure out branches or to nuke, etc.
 Main Question:
  
What is everyone using to deploy dotfiles with?
 Do you do it through Emacs via Org Mode and babel? 
  
​
 Would be curious to see everyone's setup.

 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to get pandoc into the browser. I've done some emscripten work (C++ to browser) but know nothing about compiling Haskell to the wasm+js. This could be a contract gig, the goal is an open source repo with the same license as Pandoc that can do a build of Pandoc for the browser that can run lua filters. What I'm worried about is getting emscripten to compile the C code (including the lua vm), getting Asterius or ghcjs to compile the Haskell, and getting these linked up somehow.
 Hopefully work in a fork could be upstreamed, but I think having a proof of concept would make that more likely.
 related work:
  
https://github.com/y-taka-23/wasm-pandoc (works, but no lua filters)
 https://github.com/tweag/asterius/issues/851 (asterius has a demo, but no source, and I -assume no lua filter support)
  
I'm also looking for free advice. How should I deal with the C pieces? Turn things into dylibs, something something linking? Does ghcjs have a way to link output from emscripten? Presumably I should not compile the lua vm separately and inject a JS shim for Pandoc communicating with it, although this would be more in my comfort zone?

 ​
 I am looking for alternatives for the "Algorithm W" for type interference.
 I saw another way to implement this in Stephen Diehls book : http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/006_hindley_milner.html 
 I like the idea of splitting up the generation of constraints and solving these constraints.
 But I don't know where this algorithm is from and if there are better algorithms/implementations for type interference. 
 Can you please help me about that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I want to do
 My goal is to have a way to determine (in org mode) how much time has passed since a timestamp at point. For example, if my cursor is on a timestamp like this: [2022-01-13 Thu 18:34], I want to run the function and have it echo the amount of time between that timestamp and the current date and time.
 My solution
 I put together a function to do exactly that:
 (defun my-org-time-since () "Print the amount of time between the timestamp at point and the current date and time." (interactive) (unless (org-at-timestamp-p 'lax) (user-error "Not at timestamp")) (save-mark-and-excursion (unless (member (char-before) '(?\] ?>)) (re-search-forward "[\]>]")) (push-mark) (re-search-backward "[\[<]") (kill-ring-save (point) (mark)) (with-temp-buffer (insert (current-kill 0)) (insert "--") (org-time-stamp '(16)) (org-evaluate-time-range)) (rotate-yank-pointer 1))) 
 (edit: updated to use with-temp-buffer)
 My question
 I'm relatively new to elisp, so I'm wondering: is there a better way to do this? Or if not, how can I improve my solution?

 However, I get this weird popup from IntelliJ that tells me "Cannot resolve overloaded constructor `RowMatrix`" when I try to create a RowMatrix.
 I tried many things to solve it and did some research on the web but I couldn't find anything on why that happens. Could you help me understand the situation please?
 My code is the following:
 import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession import org.apache.log4j.{Level, Logger} import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.{HashingTF, Tokenizer, IDF} import org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.RowMatrix object A { val session = SparkSession.builder() .appName("A") .master("local[*]") .getOrCreate() def main(args : Array[String]): Unit = { // do stuff to organize RDDs, DFs and compute TF-IDF .. .. val finalRDD = finalDF.rdd val mat: RowMatrix = new RowMatrix(finalRDD) }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I recently changed my org install to address this message "IMPORTANT: please install Org from GNU ELPA as Org ELPA will close before Org 9.6" and now I can't get org-agenda to work. When I run org-agenda, I get the message org-agenda-get-day-entries: Invalid function: (date date) . When I make the value of org-agenda-files blank, then I don't get that error, but then obviously nothing shows up in the agenda files. I tried adding in the agenda files via customize rather than using setq , but the error shows up with both methods. 
 I found this reddit thread, but the solution to do a doom clean and build does not apply to me since I am not using doom. 
 Any assistance would be appreciated. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I just wanted to announce that there is a new version of the dtache package available :). The package integrates the program dtach into Emacs in order to provide detached shell commands.
 The additions to the package provided in this version are:
  
dtache comes with built in support for macOS. A timer based solution is used to issue notification
 dtache now supports eshell through the dtache-eshell.el
 dtache integration with consult is provided through dtache-consult.el
 dtache-shell-command has been majorly improved and is now an alternative to running async-shell-command
 dtache integration with compile is provided through dtache-compile.el
 dtache now has a unified dtache-detach-dwim command which is supposed to be used to detach from a session in all supported modes
 dtache now features an enhanced dtache-open-session command
 dtache now features versioning of the sessions that are persistently stored and will automatically detect when the database contains outdated session objects
 dtache now uses filenotify for both local and remote sessions, this provides an improved experience for remote sessions. Currently this is only provided on Linux based distributions
  
The package is available at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there, entered the realm of emacs two days ago. So far it's been tears and agony. Not because I'm trying to learn a completely new keyboard system but because of the exact opposite of that; My laziness. Long story short I instantly jumped into Ergoemacs. In fact, that was the reason I found the courage in myself to try Emacs however it turned out to be a nightmare.
 I'm sorry I'm taking a bit too much let's get to the point Ergoemacs doesn't have the best guide that humankind has ever seen. The dev was talking about customization and two things specifically caught my attention; The sentence "These keys are defined in the ergoemacs-keymap" and the word "ergoemacs-layout-us.el" I been trying to locate these two things for the past five hours. I checked every little bit of creators Github I check every file that came with the package I checked every command related to Ergoemacs.
 Now I am aware that I can just write them one by one into my M-x as in the guide but I want to see the available ones and edit them. Or I can write them in my init.el using global keys but I have a slight order problem, I want things to go in one place ergoemacs-layout-us.el to be exact.
 This is probably got longer than it should be but cut me a slack will ya I've been sitting here for two days with 5 hours of sleep, talking to no one, and trying to tame the majestic beast that is Emacs.
 Thank you for listening my rant... I mean question. Your answers mean a lot.

 Some arguments in favour of committing
  
People who fork my library will be able to build it exactly the way I did, possibly simplifying bug reports
 I'll be able to build it in the same way on a different machine, or when cloning
  
Some arguments against committing
  
The freeze file pins base, and thus the major GHC version, but on CI I want to test multiple GHC versions, so I need to disregard the freeze file there.
  
None of these are crucial reasons to do one or the other. I'm wondering whether I've missed any important other reasons, since I have little experience with freeze files yet.

 But I also understand that when it comes to SQL, esqueleto seems to have a great reputation as a library. Should I stick with what I've already learned, or should I jump ship?

 basically I use for all but lisp xah-fly-mode, so it could be something like that. I am not into vi. I have some shortcuts setup manually to more sane things like I can org-edit-special and finish with Menu + d + d, similar to C-c C-c, but I don't like to do that for all the 1mio org-mode commands, and I don't want to use the crazy memonic default emacs commands.
 But I would be willing to something org-mode specific if it would be somewhat efficiant and or ergonomic, like paredit is. Paredit is not compatible really to xah-fly-keys or don't fit in with the logic behind fly keys, non the less it's very intuitive and efficiant.
 And again I would prefer to not invent a own key-binding for org that makes sense and set it up afterwards.
 There are btw a ton of frameworks that become more and more popular that view or edit org files in some sort of wiki / brain style, but inside the file you are still screwed and there seems to be only 1 way to do all the things one key binding, I don't think that is a good thing, as some people use other packages than paredit to edit lisp files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear friends,
After about a year of personal experiments, I present you the "Zettel Composer", a script for combining Zettelkasten notes in a variety of situations: browsing annotations, publishing a book or a paper, assembling a handout for lectures or conferences etc.
Among the nice features, the ability to "watch" files for changes and Marked 2 preview:

The experiments led me to extend the (already not universally accepted standard of) wiki link notation. This was mainly because, first, of the need to differentiate between "public" and "private" notes; and then to provide for some special behaviour depending on the different use-cases. I came to invent things like § [[1234]] to denote a "public" reference to a note to be printed; > [[1234]] for the insertion of notes containing quotes or fragments; > [[1234]] :: [[1235]] for parallel, bilingual texts. I tried my best to give appropriate documentation of these features in the project's README.
Please excuse the fact that the code is a bit messy. This is not only the result of a long process of back-and-forth experimentation but because this project was also the personal attempt to learn some Python of someone inexperienced with the language.
This project had some of its initial inspiration in books like this (V. Goldschmit's Le système stoïcien et l'idée de temps. Paris, 1953):


You may clone the project or copy the script from GitHub.]]></summary>

 I am getting an error that ox-extra appears to use a deprecated library (cl instead of cl-lib). 
 My primary issue is without it :ignore: tags in the heading don't seem to work as intended, i.e. exporting the contents of a section without the header itself. :noexport: is working fine fwiw.
 Pretty much every solution I found online says to install ox-extra though—agh!
 Could anyone point me to an up-to-date way of configuring this functionality with org export? Primarily used for latex and html if that matters. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey friends,
 Does anyone here use Emacs LSP with SASS files? I've just started using the lsp-css package and it works great on CSS files. The problem is that on SASS files it lints the buffer as if it was CSS. Also, I don't have any in-buffer completion in SASS buffers. The title of that Emacs-LSP site says CSS/LessCSS/SASS/SCSS, but since it doesn't work OOTB and I can't find any mention of SASS in the docs nor in any variable, maybe it doesn't support SASS? In that case, what do you guys use for SASS linting and SASS in-buffer completion?
 I'm using the built-ins flymake and CAPF for interactive linting and in-buffer completion (i.e. as front-ends to LSP). The value of completion-at-point-functions in SASS buffers is (tags-completion-at-point-function). Since LSP doesn't include syntax highlighting, I also use sass-mode for that.
 Thanks a lot in advance

 I've read different posts on this, the "learn emacs in 1 year" gnus manual (which us great) just tells you to use C-u M-g (which works) but I'm looking for a way to put it into my .emacs so that it's the default behavior.
 Anyone had any luck with this? All samples for code I found in other posts were untested and finally didn't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I'm currently in a situation where I use templating engines (jinja2, handlebars, etc) fairly extensive. By the looks of things, web-mode attempts to implement these things, but I'm not developing templates for HTML. To make matters worse, I cannot indent within templating engine code blocks (white space has meaning). Think code which generates python code.
 What I'm currently looking for is a minor mode which highlights not only syntax (e.g. {% if foo %}Do stuff{% endif %} - but also clearly marks the background of the code block, e.g.
  {% if foo %} do stuff {% if bar %} Do Other Things {% endif %} more stuff {% endif %} 
 Where the entire text block for do stuff and more stuff has a background color of red, then Do Other Things being an inner code block has a color of green (and additional nested blocks get new colors). Obviously red/green are examples and real world colors would be more aesthetic ;). 
 rainbow-delimiters ( https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters/ ) does this for parenthesis/braces etc but is somewhat bound to the syntax tree of whatever major mode is currently in use, it also scans on a per-character basis, where I'd need to scan for regex. 
 I've had a go using font-lock-add-keywords with regex, and while it would work for unnested code, I have no idea how to sanely deal with inner conditionals (e.g. in the above example, currently it will regex start the first if statement, but end before 'more stuff' as the lazy end terminates there. 
 Can anyone provide advice on how to achieve this, or if somebody has implemented it in the past? It would save me many headaches.

 I got the mouse to work by adding (xterm-mouse-mode 1) to my config and can now move the cursor by clicking.
 Beyond clicking, can emacs see the current mouse pointer position and do something with it? In particular, I'd like these things:
  
When scrolling with the mouse, scroll whatever window the mouse pointer is over.
 Much in the same vein, auto-focus on whatever window the mouse pointer is over. `(mouse-autoselect-window t) seems to have no effect whatsover inside a terminal.
 Get tooltips when hovering over symbols in lsp-ui mode.
  
(I'm only interested in emacs in the terminal, not the graphical interface.)

 I started with looking at the source code for org-clocktable-write-default. It looks like that function is fed a whole bunch of prepared data based on the :scope param amongst others.
 The hardest part for me as a newer elisp writer was appreciating how to extract/destructure the data. Lisp is just weird in my opinion.
 One I had sorted out the way to get my data, and which functions to use to write my table, and how to transform the data into types these functions wanted, it got easier.
 Here is the link to my init configuration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! I’ve been working on a mini backend project involving some telegram Bot Messages. I’m having some trouble understanding how to compose the subscription model for my telegram bot with Monad/F/Monix.Task type. I'm still learning how to use Effect types properly and I can't wrap my head around how I would approach this without mutation.
 I’m trying to implement the following: 
  
Allow people to subscribe to my bot (adding bot to chat + sending message). Incoming messages are received via the following API. 
 def receiveMessage(msg: Message): Task[Unit]
 msg parameter has access to Chat id
 
 Bot executes every x hours (via Monix scheduler) and sends a message to all chats that have subscribed. 
  
If I were to implement this imperatively, I’d have a dynamically sized list as a class field of MyBot, add a chatId to that list (mutating) when I receive a subscription request. Every x hours the message execution function would then reference the chatId list field. 
 How exactly do I encapsulate this behavior into a self-updating Task, or a series of Tasks? 
 Thanks in advance!
 In case it helps I'm using this library https://github.com/bot4s/telegram for telegram API.

In this post we will talk you through the data structures behind Trustix, in particular Merkle trees.
At its core, Trustix verifies computations by comparing pairs of hashable inputs and outputs between multiple builders by using build logs.
A simple set of input-output pairs would be one way to implement this build log — the log would be queried with an input hash, and would then yield the corresponding output hash.
Users could then compare it to the output hashes from other logs or binary caches, to check whether they have all obtained the same answer to a computation.
For security, these input-output pairs could be signed by the builder, which ensures their integrity as long as the signature key is not…]]></summary>

Then i used the elpy project structure to get RPC communication up and running. You can view the barely functional prototype here:
 https://github.com/cryptobadger/flight-attendant.el
 showing suggestions works...
 Sorry, its my first elisp project. Now on to the questions: How would you implement the visualization of the hints provided by Copilot? Because the suggested code snippets are arbitrary complex(?) i think using company is not feasible. Maybe in an own buffer? Right now I try to display them using overlays. This achieves the same visual presentation as in nvim, but it does not work well with company (see the provided picture). I also had problems with auto insertion of closing parens being inserted behind the suggestion and i think there will be a myriad of undiscovered bugs when i follow this path?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please comment your thoughts. Discussion could result in most universally valuable features being implemented in future builds.
Function 1 (software-implemented): Optional Visual Hierarchical Display of Saved Searches
Without affecting any other functionality, saved searched should be able to be organized into a visual expandable drop-down hierarchy, which again does not affect any other functionality, so does not implement hierarchical structuring into any aspect of the application other than the visual representation of the saved searches in the sidebar. This has obvious beneficial functionality without breaking the app. Feel free to discuss.
Function 2 (user-implemented): Bundled Tags
Right now, if I have tags #apple #banana & #pear, I am able to create a saved search called "Fruits" which saves the search query as "#apple OR #banana OR #pear". It would be advisable, in some instances, for you as the user to add the category name itself as a tag to the existing search parameters, such that the new search query is now saved as "#apple OR #banana OR #pear or #fruits". This allows the saved search to function as a category as well as a tag.
I call these types of saved searches "Categories", and the tags that represent the saved search redundantly "Category Tags"
^^^ Combining the above two functions does not deviate from to the existing principles underpinning the stated purpose of this application, yet it does serve to improve the functionality in terms of specificity (via Tags) and inclusion (via Categories).
Further extending these functions, one can imagine a nested list of category tags
For examples of infinite-depth, internally-nested collapsible lists - which would all be great functionality add to the "Saved Searches" sidebar of the Archive - check out the Workflowy app: https://workflowy.com/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello follow emacs users, I recently start using emacs because I wanted more modular environment and one of thinks I did was to align open buffer in the middle of the window (I prefer to always see single window), to do so, I use this snippet:
 (defun my-resize-margins () (let ((margin-size (/ (- (frame-width) 160) 2))) (if (> margin-size 0) (set-window-margins nil margin-size margin-size) (set-window-margins nil 0 0) (print "test")))) (add-hook 'window-configuration-change-hook #'my-resize-margins) (my-resize-margins) 
 `I also use helm for fuzzy search in almost everything, but helm buffer always open fullscreen, is there any way to achieve this? I read about 'helm-buffer-left-margin helm-left-margin-width but I'm switching between monitor and laptop screen quite often.

 I am a junior scala/spark developer working on a project. In this project, I have a main method which takes in a config as arguments, and the trouble I'm having is that this config is required throughout the whole project, in the majority of all of my functions, objects and classes. I have tried solving this issue by adding the config as an implicit parameter everywhere, but I'm curious if there are better ways of solving the issue. I am trying to to this in a functional programming way and maintaining immutability. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I write technical reports at work with org-mode and am wondering if anyone has tricks to better format the output of source blocks that generate tibbles. Here's two attempts:
 This is my typical setup, and it's including the description with the output. Not horrible, but I don't really want that (nor the variable types) in my output.
 #+begin_src R :session :exports results :results output wrap foo <- tibble( x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c("a", "b", "c")) foo #+end_src #+RESULTS: :results: # A tibble: 3 × 2 x y <dbl> <chr> 1 1 a 2 2 b 3 3 c :end: 
 I could switch to using value, which gives me an org table, but then I lose the column headers for some reason.
 #+begin_src R :session :exports results :results value foo <- tibble( x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c("a", "b", "c")) foo #+end_src #+RESULTS: | 1 | a | | 2 | b | | 3 | c | 
 Here's the default data frame output, but I'd prefer not to have to wrap everything I do in data.frame() just to get the desired output.
 #+begin_src R :session :exports results :results output wrap bar <- data.frame( x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c("a", "b", "c")) bar #+end_src #+RESULTS: :results: x y 1 1 a 2 2 b 3 3 c :end: 
 I'd be happy with either a) org tables including the header row, or b) tibble raw output, but without the # A tibble: n x m and <type> bits (though I'd accept the latter).
 I saw options for tibbles calling out max footer lines, but nothing about headers here in the suggested pillar options. I found this github issue which reqeusts more granular printing options, which would not then require any org-specific processing.
 In the meantime, it basically suggests overriding the print function with the what amounts to wrapping as a data.frame. Since that issue is locked, I just created another one to re-start that 2018 discussion now that it's 2022.
 In the meantime, anyone dealt with this and have workarounds?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I recently started using emacs and I'm coming from vscode (with vim emulation, I can't leave vim keybindings), and one of the things that are keeping me from going all-in with emacs, is the fact that there is no "clear" way to customize emacs and get what you want, or at least it's not clear to beginners.
 For example, in vscode there is syntax highlighting for a huge amount of languages, and if I want more complete support for a specific language I can install an extension easy peasy from the extension tab, in emacs, on the other hand, I would have to search for a package, install it, learn what it can do and configure it. It's somewhat daunting for someone who is not an expert like me.
 Do you guys have any advice on how to customize emacs in a simple yet efficient way (I know there are some pre-configured distros like doom or space, I still have to look into those)? My aim is to be able to add whatever feature to my emacs config easily because I want it to be feature rich.
 In the end, emacs seems to be a really powerful tool compared to vscode (which I think is already pretty powerful), but it's not clear *how* you should use it...

 I have the requirement to search for checkboxes that are located within a resolved heading that has any todo keyword which is DONE or CANCELLED on my side. Bonus points for finding unchecked checkboxes in any sub-heading (with or without todo keywords!) of resolved headings.
 With my limited Elisp knowledge, I'd take one of my simple Python parsers and adapt it accordingly so that I get heading-IDs and their unchecked checkboxes as stdout output.
 However, I think that this is something that others may have already solved in a more elegant (Elisp) fashion.
 So: do you know any existing approach that solves this task already before I start implementing on my own?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really hope I haven't wandered down a dead-end here. I have a Behaviour that gives the currently selected Color, and the current mouse coordinates, then carries out a task when the mouse is clicked. That task involves looking at a list and then updating the values in that list, for it to be retrieved later. The fact that I can "store" the selected color gives me hope that storing a list can be done in a similar manner. I'm just at a dead end and not sure how to solve this. Would really appreciate some help.
 ``` -- There is a Blue button and a Red button on our UI. Whichever -- button was clicked last is our current color selection.
 colorRedSelected = const ColorRed <$ UI.click redButton colorBlueSelected = const ColorBlue <$ UI.click blueButton
 -- we combine both the above Events to create a new one that tells us the current selected color
 colorSelected = unionWith const colorRedSelected colorBlueSelected
 -- accumulate values for our Behaviour, starting with ColorRed selected by default
 colorMode <- accumB ColorRed modeEvent
 -- create a Behaviour
 mouseCoordinate <- stepper (0,0) $ UI.mousemove canvas
 -- want to start with the list [1,2,3,4], but this value should change later. -- I have 'never' here, as I don't know what else to put here yet.
 listState <- accumB ([1,2,3,4]) never
 -- Combine the Behaviours, we now have a tuple (chosenColorMode, mouseCoordinateTuple, savedList)
 let choices = (,,) <$> colorMode <> mouseCoordinate <> listState
 -- Apply the event (of the user clicking the canvas) to the Behaviour, -- creating a new Event that returns the above tuple when it fires 
 makeChoice = choicePosition <@ UI.click canvas
 onEvent makeChoice $ (colorMode, (x,y), savedList) -> do ... -- in this block we use the savedList, and generate a newList. -- I want to update the choicePosition behaviour so that the newList -- replaces the old savedList. ```

Maybe this setting is available via a command-line switch?

So I'll want to make sure I get card-linking right, sooner rather than later.  I've looked around and can't quite find an explanation of what Luhmann was doing with slashes and commas.  Can anyone point me to a summary  of those subtleties of his linking syntax?

 Both functions are in my init.el file. 
 Reload my init.el file.
 Run mykeyMap1, it works (.). Now, period is my prefix key
 But if I run mykeyMap2, prefix key (`) does not work.
 My question is.
 Do I need to unbind myprefix-map before rebind it again to other prefix-command ?
 What is the simplest way to rebind my prefix-command so that I can switch different prefix key anytime I want ?

I want to remove it and anything depending on it but I can't find information about installed packages and their dependencies. list-packages ignores packages installed with use-package and that is NOT ok IMO. Is there a way to a dependency tree over helm in a standard use-package + straight setup?

 I have a few orgmode files for my todos and whatnot, but I am struggling to have them synced across my laptops and my desktop. I have tried using a git repo, but too often I forgot to push my changes when transitioning from home (laptop) to office(desktop), or vice versa. I tried using a nextcloud dir, but this quickly filled with "(conflicted copy)" copies, making keeping track of the latest version a hell.
 IMO the git route is most robust, but does anybody have a tip on how to manage it in an automagic dwiw way ? 
 Crontabbing a pull && commit && push cycle is imo too hamfisted, but I am not above it. Keeping the org files on a tramp-accessible server is too confined (esp when exporting etc).
 Or maybe a solution I have not tought of ?
 ​
 thx

 To keep things consistent, let me know what you think about the "monthly" salary for a developer with:
 a. Little to no experience with production Haskell.
 b. 1-2 years experience
 c. 2-5 years experience
 d. 5 years+
 Curious to see what ya'll think!

 I am trying to enable history, could someone please help with following?
 1, I am using counsel-M-x with smex, it makes last used commands displayed first, but is it also possible to cycle back/forward the command history like in regular M-x with up/down keys? Function is “previous-line-or-history-element”, but when i try it in Counsel-M-x it simply closes the mini-buffer, same with “ivy-previous-line-or-history”.
 2, Is it possible to achieve same for M-: (pp-eval-expression), after connecting Counsel-M-x/smex they stopped working.
 3, and for C-h v|f?
 4, Is it possible to make 1,2,3 persistent across sessions?
 5, What’s the relationship between smex and savehist? Does one depend on the other? What’s the difference between them? (currently i don’t have savehist enabled) 
 p.s. This is my counsel-M-x / smex config:
 (use-package ivy :config (ivy-mode 1) (setq ivy-re-builders-alist '((t . ivy--regex-ignore-order))) (setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t) (setq ivy-count-format "(%d/%d)") (setq ivy-initial-inputs-alist nil) ) (use-package counsel :config (counsel-mode 1) ) (use-package smex )

 As a course project, I am trying to implement a (simulation) of the Raft protocol. In this post, I will not use Raft terminology at all; instead, I will use a simplified one.
 The protocol is run by a number of servers (for example, 5) which can be in three different states (A, B, C). The servers inherit some state variables and behavior from a "base" kind, but they all also have many unique state variables …]]></summary>

 I've got a SaaS operation (built with Haskell) that now has paying users. I want to start shipping features faster and get some help on the dev side so I can focus on growing the user base. Based on the revenue from the business right now, I can pay a salary of $2k/month USD full time.
 My questions:
  
What kind of talent do you think I can get at that salary level?
 Do you think it would be better to hire and train now or hire at a later stage once the user base is larger and I can afford a higher salary?
 Where would you look for devs? Any general tips?
  
Either way, depending on the experience of the dev, I'd bump up the salary as the app continues to acquire more users.
 I appreciate any input and feedback :)
 EDIT #1
  
I'm talking $2k USD per month.
 I'd be willing to modify the contract so the dev can have a much higher upside if the business is successful - something on the lines of high bonuses on milestones, or some kind of profit sharing.
 My eventual goal is to pay the best and most competitive salaries in the industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am making a minor mode for entering commands with one keystroke and I was wondering if it's possible to bind a command to keys like ctrl, alt and capslock like this:
 (define-minor-mode some-mode ;; The initial value. nil ;; The indicator for the mode line. " some-mode" ;; The minor mode bindings. '(((kbd "SPC") . some-function) ;; I know space can be bound to like this ((kbd "RET") . some-other-function) ;; and return like this ((kbd "CTRL") . function3) ((kbd "META") . function4) ((kbd "CAPSLOCK") . function5) ;; But the last three kbd functions yield the string argument itself )) 
 Is binding to ctrl and meta alone possible at all? If so, how would one accomplish this within a minor mode definition?
 Thanks
 Edit: After I posted here I found a similar problem to mine, which the poster solved with an OS-level workaround. This would not really be a great solution for me since it would also change behavior outside of Emacs. But I thought I should leave it here in case someone with a similar problem finds this post.

I could go through the GitHub page, but it doesn't open up until you look at it for a long time. Does anyone have an overview or a medium page? 
 I want to know where these "magic machines" (IO Monad) work, how are threads handled and how is it technically guaranteed that IO is referentially transparent?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I couldn't find this solution anywhere online so I thought I'd share, sorry if it's been discussed before.
 In my case I wanted to have a FromField & ToField instance (coming from the sqlite-simple package) for UUID fields (coming from the uuid package). It can be achieved without newtype wrapping or having orphan instances, using the DerivingVia GHC extension:
 newtype SqlUUID a = MkSqlUUID a instance (a ~ UUID) => FromField a where fromField field = ... -- The definition is not really interesting, same as you would write for a UUID minus the MkSqlUUID wrapping instance (a ~ UUID) => ToField a where toField (MkSqlUUID uuid) = ... -- Again, not really interesting -- In another module: newtype UserId = MkUserId UUID deriving FromField via (SqlUUID UUID) deriving ToField via (SqlUUID UUID) 
 I've tested this and it seems to work but I'm not a very experienced haskell so there might be some downsides/pitfalls using this method that I'm not aware of. Let me know what you think :)
 Edit: probably should've been more clear. It doesn't solve the orphan instances problem in general but previously I needed an orphan FromField UUID and ToField UUID so I can do deriving FromField for my UserId type.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I am an undergrad who recently fell in love with Haskell (~4 months!). As a hobby project, I am building a collaborative web-based code editor with a Haskell-backend and a Typescript+React frontend.
 I have finished implementing the Operational Transformation logic (the core logic behind resolving multiple asynchronous edits to a central document) in Haskell, and am now in the process of designing the backend. Architecturally, I think clients communicating with the server via WebSockets would be the obvious choice.
 To that end, what would be the best tool to set up WebSocket servers? I’ve spend some time googling about yesod-websockets and Network.Websockets (jaspervdj/websockets), but I am having trouble deciding which would be best for my context. Could anyone who has experience with either share some insight?
 Thank you so much!!

 2) open the pdf directly from the citation (I don't quite know how to add pdf links to the citation)
 3) add page numbers to the citation, without corrupting my bibtex file

 I often open up org capture to add a journal entry and use it for taking some notes eg during a meeting. For some reason, I seem to sometimes hit undo and lose work or select something to copy/paste and have it overwrite the selection, then have to try to undo the undo and often it's just lost. Probably just need to learn to avoid doing some of these bad habits, but after a way to avoid losing work. Worst part is that I then have to try to remember all the notes I've written and often can't recall them all....which is why I'm doing a capture in the first place.
 Using doom emacs currently with mostly stock configuration, but Evil Mode and vi commands are generally what I'm using.

I know got global variables I could use make-local-variable and kill-local-variable; is there a sort of similar layering functionality for variables that are buffer-local by design or do I need to write my own?
 EDIT: I've done a poor job explaining myself; sorry I was on my phone last night and jotted this down. Let me try to explain:
 I've written a minor-mode for reading that affects some already buffer-local variables, like indicate-empty-lines, or blink-cursor-mode, etc. These are variables that might already have buffer-local values that I want to persist as I'm toggling my minor mode on and off (in my specific case, I want to turn reading-mode on when I enter view-mode, and off when I exit that mode).
 My current implementation can be found in my emacs configuration, but it doesn't work correctly and I feel like there might be a better way built-in to Emacs. Any guidance there would be helpful!

It's just agonizingly slow. 
 Using shell-mode with the same path runs the commands instantly, so it doesn't seem to be a problem with tramp. Is this a known problem with eshell? Is it possible to configure eshell to run remote commands as quickly as using ssh in a terminal?

My current ideas is to generate the code, save it to a file, byte compile it and load it. If the file exists, simply load it. Does that make sense to you ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm kind of struggling to understand how closely tied a major mode could or should be to minor modes that provide complementary functionality.
 Basically, I'm working on a major mode that provides font-lock highlighting, indentation rules and keyboard shortcuts for various functionality.
 On top of this, I've so far successfully leveraged two minor modes:- company-mode (auto-completion using a backend provided by the major-mode)- flycheck-mode (a simple flycheck-checker)
 Now to the pickle:
 As an author of the major mode, I've envisioned auto-completion and error reporting and highlighting as integral parts of the mode, yet my understanding is that these are by design orthogonal to major-modes and are opt-in, and users usually enable in hooks if desired.
  
Would it be considered to be bad citizenship to have the major-mode automatically enable these modes?
 How would this actually be done in a sane way? Setting a local company-backend can be done in the define-derived-mode body, and flycheck-define-checker seems to happily register itself, or perhaps an (add-to-list 'flycheckers <checker>) is required, but to actually enable the minor-modes?Sure, it works to just end the mode-body with (company-mode) and (flycheck-mode) but that just feels...wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear haskellers,
 I'm toying with time-series data structures, similar to pandas.DatetimeIndex if you're familiar.
 One thing that I wish I could do was clearly distinguish between unknown frequency, and fixed frequency (e.g. hourly, daily, etc).
 My solution right now is to use phantom types, such as:
 ```haskell import Data.Time (UTCTime) -- from time package newtype Index f = Index [UTCTime]
 data UnknownFreq data Daily
 mkIndex :: [UTCTime] -> Index UnknownFreq
 daily :: UTCTime -> UTCTime -> Index Daily daily start stop = ...
 toDaily :: Index UnknownFreq -> Index Daily toDaily (Index ts) = daily (minimum t) (maximum t) ```
 Then, if I don't export the constructor for Index, it's harder to misuse and have an index which has type frequency Daily, but a real frequency of some other value.
 Another possibility would be to enforce the frequency of the index structurally, e.g.:
 haskell data Frequency = Hourly | Daily data Index = Index { indexStart :: UTCTime , indexStop :: UTCTime , indexFreq :: Frequency } 
 but then how can I also track the frequency a the type-level?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem I am trying to solve is that I have foreign bindings to an external C library that occasionally crashes due to code in the C library beyond my control. I would like to isolate the code that runs in the C library in a child process and restart the child process when it crashses, and I want to continue using the Haskell API we built around it. I would like to fork() the Haskell server process but not call execve(), rather have the child process call into the IO () function that runs the foreign code.
 Unfortunately, the System.Process.CmdSpec data type in the process package doesn't allow you to fork an arbitrary IO function, you MUST provide it a path to an executable as a RawCommand or ShellCommand. I am wondering if there is an easy way to solve my problem without going through the hassle of rolling my own version of System.Process.createProcess using the POSIX APIs in the unix package?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get a grip on creating my own types in haskell. 
 As a starting point I created:
 data Coords = Coords (Int, Int, Int) deriving (Show) instance Eq Coords where (Coords (x,y,z)) == (Coords (x',y',z')) = x==x' && y==y' && z==z' instance Num Coords where (Coords (x,y,z)) + (Coords (x',y',z')) = Coords(x+x', y+y', z+z') (Coords (x,y,z)) - (Coords (x',y',z')) = Coords(x-x', y-y', z-z') (Coords (x,y,z)) * (Coords (x',y',z')) = Coords(x*x', y*y', z*z') negate (Coords (x,y,z)) = Coords (-x,-y,-z) abs (Coords (x,y,z)) = Coords(abs x, abs y, abs z) signum (Coords (x,y,z)) = Coords(signum x, signum y, signum z) fromInteger a = Coords(fromInteger a,fromInteger a,fromInteger a) 
 This enables me to do things like
 Coords (1,2,3) + Coords (4,5,6) 
 To my understanding I would need to create an instance of Functor when I have a function that operates on the 3-tuple but does not know about Coords:
 move n (x,y,z) = (x+n, y+n, z+n) 
 In the hopes I can use it like this:
 move 6 <$> Coords (1,2,3) 
 I created this:
 instance Functor Coords where fmap f (Coords a) = Coords (f a) 
 Upon which the compiler complains: 
 Expected kind '* -> *' but Coords has kind '*' 
 Suppose I define the type like:
 data Coords a = Coords a deriving (Show) 
 Than my functor works but I've no Idea how to implement the instances for Eq and Num
 What am I missing or what am I doing wrong?

 Is there a version with readable function help?
 Otherwise, does someone happen to know what faces I should tweak make the text in the help box readable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The org-parser is an amazing library written by 200ok-ch. I want to share my joy with you about it.
 Certainly, this is not the first org parser out there. What's different, however, is that it's a programmatic parser with a formal specification. Lost? Let me explain. 
 TLDR: it parses a formal grammar of org-mode in its EBN form, and generates a parser!
 What is an EBN form?
 Let's quickly go through what an EBN form is. Roughly, it is a specification of the grammar of grammars! For example, the following is an EBN form for simple math expressions (taken here).
 (setq simple-math-grammar " <S> = VAL | EXPR | PAR PAR = <'('> S <')'> <EXPR> = S OP S VAL = #'[0-9]+' OP = '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' ") 
 With this grammar specification, it's an interesting problem to write a parser generator parser…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, does anyone know a way to expand shell environment variables in the properties drawer?
 Currently I use a tangle-dir funciton that gets a value from the properties drawer and expands it into a path that can be used as target for tangling:
 emacs-lisp (defun tangle-dir (sub-path) "Expand the SUB-PATH into the directory given by the tangle-dir property if that property exists, else use the `default-directory'." ;; (interactive) (expand-file-name sub-path (or (org-entry-get (point) "tangle-dir" 'inherit) (default-directory)))) 
 usage:
 ```org :PROPERTIES: :tangle-dir: dir/subdir :END:
 +begin_src :tangle (tangle-dir "file.txt")
 ...
 +end_src
 ```
 Now I'd like to be able to use shell enviroment variables on :tangle-dir: like :tangle-dir: (getenv "scripts")/subdir or :tangle-dir: $var/subdir.
 Any ideas on how to do this?

 Before this book, I've read the <scala-with-cats> book as well as first 5 chapters of <essential-effects-draft> and first 6 chapters of the red book-<Functional Program in Scala>.
 But when I read to <Practical FP in Scala-A Hands on Approach> page 22, I became difficult to understand the lines like `make[F[_]: Functor: Ref.Make] ` what does the multi-colon here suppose to me. As I skipped this question and goes on, more and more lines baffles me, such as the `===` signature in `if (id === adminUser.id) adminUser.pure[F] `, etc
 I think my foundation is not good to understand this book directly. Where should I turn to before I can read this <Practical FP in Scala-A Hands on Approach> with more ease?

 Thank you.

 I use it as a yearly free-form journal, without agenda integration.
 And I wonder, maybe monthly and weekly journals are easier to maintain or review?
 Daily journals seems to hard to read or search through, if I have some theme developed in time and entries.

When I last taught in 2018, I had the students use WinGHCi on their home computers (if Windows) or lab computers. I see that WinGHCi has gotten a lot harder to install in the meantime, and I don't know if students will be able to come to the lab this semester or if we'll still be online, so I'd like to find a free cloud-based solution.
 Repl.it and Coding Rooms have Haskell compilers but not interpreters. I'd like for students to be able to write code in one file/pane and to be able to interact with it in another (i.e., have a read-eval-print loop). We only do fairly simple things in Haskell (such as finding prime numbers) so don't need package management, graphics, etc.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Thinking out loud, hoping maybe someone can give me a good idea.
 So I develop an app with Scala on the backend and a Scala.js (Laminar) frontend, with SBT. Everything about it is great!
 Except compilation times, even incremental. Now, I do everything on my laptop (Thinkpad with OK specs), because I like to use ssh to a FreeBSD VM and use raw Vim, and when the VM is local it doesn't care about network interruptions or a wonky ISP. I like a normal SSH session because of the scroll history, and I like to use i3wm to lay out and manage terminals and using mosh or something would require tmux which I find more awkward.
 If I try out a high-end server just to compare compilation times, it's more than twice as fast. How to take advantage of that?
 Is there something like a distcc for SBT, or another way to leverage remote CPU power? Even if I have to put it in my local network? I guess I could run the build environment on a build server and only expose the sourcecode via NFS or such to the laptop (which should recover after a network interruption), or some edit-over-ssh tool.
 What is everyone else doing?

 I'm trying to step through the code of a lisp function. To simplify this problem, I'm just doing it with a custom hello-world function. I'm looking at these manual pages for guidance:
 Entering the Debugger on a Function Call
 Using the Debugger
 Backtraces
 So, following those pages, I:
 Define the hello world function in my init.el
 ;; This is the ONLY thing in my init.el for now, ;; to try to remove any other possible points of failure. (defun hello-world () (message "Hello world") (interactive)) 
 Open emacs and set a breakpoint on the function
 M-x debug-on-entry Debug on entry to function: hello-world 
 Run the hello world function
 M-x hello-world 
 A Backtrace buffer opens up. It displays
 Debugger entered--entering a function: * hello-world() funcall-interactively(hello-world) call-interactively(hello-world record nil) command-execute(hello-world record) execute-extended-command(nil "hello-world" "hello-world") funcall-interactively(execute-extended-command nil "hello-world" "hello-world") call-interactively(execute-extended-command nil nil) command-execute(execute-extended-command 
 I would expect to run the commands from Backtraces manual page, like 'n' in order to advance to the next line. But I'm getting an 'n is undefined'. What am I missing here exactly?

A lot of the stuff I've been interested in building lately is pretty graph-y. I think it could be nice to have a reusable store for graph like data in emacs. It would make it a lot easier for packages to interop and extend each other if there was a shared data structure underneath.
 Anyway, this is the current, and very early, status of that idea. Would be interested to hear any feedback!

 Is it possible to have properties defined as some function of other properties? For example, is there any way that I could set up something like the following:
 :PROPERTIES: :A: 10 :B: 5 :total: A+B :END: 
 Where the property total, when accessed via things such as the agenda, would evaluate to 15?
 My specific intention here is to create a singular property that is a function of priority, urgency, and impact, giving an overall metric for deciding which tasks to do next.
 Thanks!

 I've just closed the last page of the last chapter of Haskell Programming from First Principles. It took me about 2 months of mostly consistent effort.
 I really liked a lot of the concepts I've grokked from this little adventure; the chapters from monoids through monad transformers in particular showed me a new, very different level of abstraction with which I could think through common programming problems in the future.
 What I haven't done is make any big contributions or study what the job ecosystem looks like yet. Someone just recommended if I wanted to start programming right I should work through this book, and I had a few months of downtime between finishing my degree and starting the job search, so I did it.
 So the only question I have left is: What's next? What would you recommend to someone who just finished this book, but doesn't have any other significant coding experience they can put on their resume?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I have managed to break the 'expected' behaviour of most commands which use -other-window-like behaviour. E.g., dired-other-window, helpful-key or projectile-dired-other-window. If I have one window open, they indeed split the window in two - as expected. However, if I already have two windows open, they end up opening a third window by splitting the current window. The behaviour up until yesterday (...) was that in case of two open windows in the frame, the commands would use the non-current window. 
 I have been going through my config and can't figure out what changed! Any tips from more experienced users will be awesome! I think there is some variable or setting that is playing up.

 I found llvm-hs but it has not seen a release for more than two years and depends on an older version of llvm. Work seems to be underway to port it to a more current version.
 Did I miss something? I feel there could be room for a simpler codegen library written in pure Haskell, in addition to big and serious libraries like llvm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the greatest obstacles in switching to Emacs for me is (or rather was) that I have a considerable collection of notes in OneNote, that I rely on quite a bit, and which I'd be sad to loose in the switch. This is my solution to that problem.
 OneWayOut (owo) can export all your OneNote notes to Emacs Org Mode (or any Pandoc-supported Markdown, as of today), and allows you to tailor the results to your best liking by:
  
Giving you complete control over the Pandoc call 
 
Allowing you to post-process the Pandoc output with tailored Markup Packs.
 
 You can see a test OneNote note and its Emacs Org Mode and Pandoc Markdown exports here https://github.com/alopezrivera/owo#results
 Markup Packs are markup-format-specific functions containing search and replace queries executed at runtime against the text output by Pandoc. If search and replace doesn't cut it, you can add a postprocessing scriptblock to increase your freedom. They effectively give you control over how all is rendered, including
 - Headers
 - Metadata (eg: note creation date) 
 - Other markup elements such as horizontal lines, custom indentations and formatting, and whatever else you might be able to conjure up with the text in your notes
 OneWayOut is built on the foundation of ConvertOneNote2Markdown (https://github.com/theohbrothers/ConvertOneNote2Markdown), by SjoerdV (https://github.com/SjoerdV), and improved by nixsee (https://github.com/nixsee/) and theohbrothers (https://github.com/theohbrothers).
 All feedback or suggestions are welcome! Thanks for checking it out :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One minor thing that really annoys me is when I edit a file, do find-file and then the first entry selected is the lock file for the file I just edited. I don't think there's ever a situation where you'd want to open a lock file interactively, but there also isn't a built in way (that I know of) to exclude it from completion because the lock file is of the form .#original-filename. completion-ignored-extensions only works with suffixes so for it to work here you'd need to have the # character or some other at the end of the file name. I just tweaked lock-file-name-transforms to do this but I'm curious why the default format seems to intentionally pick a form we can't easily ignore. Is it just a legacy thing or is there a reason I'm not seeing?

 This build enables native compilation. As it is not compiling all the .el files of Emacs ahead of time as of now, it will compile them as you start using Emacs. I plan to enable ahead of time compilation in the next build (Found that the 28.0.91 has just released, that will be the next build).
 Please give it a try, and let me know how the install/upgrade goes. If you face any issues, comment here or create an issue on the GitLab repository.
 How to install the pretest on Fedora
 ``` sudo dnf copr enable bhavin192/emacs-pretest sudo dnf update emacs 
 or
 sudo dnf install emacs ```
 If you face any other issues, consider reporting them via M-x report-emacs-bug or respective package mailing list / bug tracking system.
 PS: I usually post about these pretest builds on Mastodon: - https://toots.dgplug.org/tags/emacs_pretest - https://toots.dgplug.org/@bhavin192

 The reason seems to be Scala 3's new encoding for lazy vals, where a reflective access to a variable called bitmap takes place. To demonstrate this, I took the http4s g8 template, set it up with Scala 3.1.0, added sbt native-image, started the nativeImageRunAgent and ran a single request against GET /joke. After stopping the server, the native-image run agent generated the reflective configs that are required for this path of execution. Comparing the generated Scala 2.13 with the Scala 3 configs yields a bloated version for Scala 3 that contains these additional rules:
 { "name":"org.http4s.Header$Raw$", "fields":[{"name":"0bitmap$1"}]} , { "name…]]></summary>

For example, if the package renames the command how can I be sure this will not break my extra config on top of that. Is there any conditional tweak that can ensure that the command exists?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm going through i-am-tom's Haskell exercises, currently I'm doing "06-TypeFamilies", and I'm not getting the answer to question two to go through the type checker. The problem description is:
  
Write a 'flatMap' function that takes a `Vector n a`, and a function`a -> Vector m b`, and produces a list that is the concatenation of these results.
  
What we have is:
 data Nat = Z | S Nat data Vector (count :: Nat) (a :: Type) where VNil :: Vector 'Z a VCons :: a -> Vector n a -> Vector ('S n) a type family (x :: Nat) + (y :: Nat) :: Nat where 'Z + y = y ('S x) + y = 'S (x + y) type family (x :: Nat) ** (y :: Nat) :: Nat where 'Z ** y = 'Z ('S x) ** y = y + x ** y append :: Vector m a -> Vector n a -> Vector (m + n) a append VNil ys = ys append (VCons x xs) ys = VCons x (append xs ys) 
 The definition of flatMap that I came up with (and that is also in the answers branch of the repository) is:
 flatMap :: Vector n a -> (a -> Vector m b) -> Vector (n ** m) b flatMap VNil _ = VNil flatMap (VCons x xs) f = append (f x) (flatMap xs f) 
 This gives a type error though:
 Could not deduce: (m + (n1 ** m)) ~ ((m + n1) ** m) from the context: n ~ 'S n1 bound by a pattern with constructor: VCons :: forall a (n :: Nat). a -> Vector n a -> Vector ('S n) a, in an equation for ‘flatMap’ 
 I'm running ghc 8.10.7 for this. Any idea of what is wrong?

Viewing the files 


You are still able to edit individual files while in this combined view.

And you can also rearrange the order of the files and have this reflected in the combined view.

This function seems incredibly useful for arranging and editing a final piece of writing.
Is there any plain text editor/viewer that is able to give the same functionality?
The ability to rearrange the order of the files could be replicated by placing then editing number at the start of the file, though this would be cumbersome to do manually. It would be great if a piece of software could automatically edit numbers in at the start of the file name as individual files are rearranged, but this might be asking too much.
Is any software able to show multiple notes in a "Scrivenings" like view?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl,dr
I'm looking for an objective(-ish) measure of the one-thought-only measures. Any ideas?
a small background:
Recently, I have been getting into learning programming, and I stumbled into Uncle Bob's lectures on clean coding (available on youtube, as of now). In there he outlines that there is this principle that a good function, is a function that does one thing, and does it well.
However the one thing was up for interpretation. (for example It used to be a fuction that can fit into a screen. which is not really that well of a measure). He goes on to say that they came up with a good objective measure:  a function that no one can meaningfully extract another function from.
It seems like a very well solution for a definition problem.
The need for "one thought"
The same sort of definition problem is also present in the case of a zettel. Although assuming one thought per zettel might not be essential nor desireable for every type of zettelkasten, it can be useful for some, in order to make a synthesis of an unstructured body of knowledge and emerge with a structure.
For example, I might be trying to understand a school of though, this school may be offering argument A as a an argument for their belief.  However, argument A is made up of 5 parts, each part can be argued against, in seperate ways, and the arguments against may be challenged in different ways and so on. One might try to gather arguements againts and try to categorize them, summerize them, and essentially refactor them.  In this situation, if each zettel only contain one and only one thought, it would be much more of an elegant workflow to put them against each other.
The need for objectivity
An objective measure, can be extremely useful, in order to maintain the flow, and unload a cognitive load of "is it too big or too small?" 
The matter
What are your thoughts on this matter?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was trying to install a haskell code formatter to make sure my xmomad config looks nice. I installed stylish-haskell with cabal, since my system doesn't package it in its repos. I tried it, it didn't format the code how I wanted it to, so I thought "that's fine, I'll just uninstall it and try another formatter".
 Long story short, apparently I can't. I tried to find out why, and apparently the best excuse is "cabal isn't a package manager". Ok, so what the fuck am I meant to use to manage packages? Stack can't uninstall either. 
 Every github issue asking for uninstall functions is seemingly shut down with a response like "I can't really see the use case for this". Like what? What if you just don't want the fucking package anymore? That's like not adding brakes to a car because you "don't see the use case, the point of a car is to go fast".
 Why does a language like haskell not have a proper package manager? How do you live like this?

 Do you guys autoload your own defined functions (not third-party) in your init file (or files)?. For functions which will potentially be used in multiple packages, using (with-)eval-after-load to defer their loading wouldn't really work, would it?
 What's your setup for this? I can only think of putting them all in the same file(s), generating the autoloads file for it (with update-file-autoloads), and then loading the generated file instead of the original. The problem with this is that it would then load all the functions in the file instead of only the requested one, wouldn't it? Also, I like to keep code tidy and those functions definitions make more sense if they are somewhere else in the code.
 Maybe I'm over-engineering my config. I was just wondering what would be the most optimal approach for this and what are you guys doing with your configs.
 Thanks a lot in advance!
 EDIT: I've specified more that I'm talking about my own defined code, not installed packages.

However, I do think that this will resonate well with the community here since we all probably have experienced similar situations where people did reject text-based information or tools just because of their aesthetics.
 We should be aware of this lock-in situation based on information format. With my article, you may have a go-to to send out for rising the awareness in peers.
 Maybe you know some positive examples and want to share them in the comments below?
 I once read about a research department(?) in the early eighties where secretaries were using GNU/Emacs and even creating lots of Elisp functions "just because nobody told them that this is actual programming. They just did this because this made their life easier." (paraphrased from my memory).
 So, is there a good story you know where non-tech-savvy people were using "nerdy" tools like GNU/Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Story time. After many years of struggle, around a year ago, I finally had my eureka moment and eventually felt comfortable using Haskell in production. In the non-fp realm, I am a tech lead with a good amount of exp & industrial perspective. I'm still learning a lot in FP/Haskell (with the more advanced topics).
 As Erik, one of my favorite teacher used to say, "you don't understand it deep enough until you start teaching it". At the risk of being a cliché, I'm, ehem, starting a youtube channel:
 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiaFQ7p683Dr-oXMdUGRLHA/videos
 The main idea of this channel is to teach FP/Haskell by analogy instead of first principle. I know it's controversial but I think this will help bring down the barrier to entry to the eco system. I believe in the idea of "know one teach one" and hope to get rid of the uncontrolled side effects in the world, one function at a time. I plan to upload every 2 weeks or so at this stage.
 I'm writing this to look for some initial help, particularly in the following areas.
  
I'm looking for people who comes from mainstream (non FP) language and are currently struggling with FP/Haskell to preview and/or suggest contents to ensure developer friendliness.
 I'm looking for people who uses FP in production and have a deep understanding of the topic to yell at me (in private) to ensure that I don't say the wrong thing and leading people down the wrong paths.
  
I'm after a handful of allies to start a micro community/learning group over email or discord. If this interests you, please drop me a comment here and/or send me a PM, specifying which group above you'd consider yourself to be in (newcomers or veterans), and I'll follow up.
 Toward a functional world!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those of you who use VS Code and are interested in using Tailwind CSS in Haskell using Lucid I have figured out how to get the Tailwind extension working so that you get autocomplete and info tooltips. Here is a screenshot:
 https://imgur.com/a/EeN4vW9
 I would say that autocomplete is essential when authoring HTML with Tailwind because otherwise you have to keep referring to the cheat sheet, and if you make a typo or attempt a sizing that doesn't exist then there is no type safety to tell you.
 And info hovers are also useful for reading code because it shows you the actual CSS for each class (otherwise you again have to refer to the cheat sheet all the time or memorize all of the tailwind classes).
 Instructions:
 First install the tailwind extension for VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss
 Then you will need to create a tailwind.config.js file. You can use this:
 module.exports = { content: ["./src/**/*.hs"], theme: { extend: {}, }, plugins: [], }; 
 In order for the VS Code extension to work, it seems that it needs a local/project install of tailwind and postcss, so you can run this:
 $ npm init $ npm install tailwindcss $ npm install postcss 
 Finally, the crucial step: in your VS Code settings.json add these two settings to configure the extension:
  "tailwindCSS.includeLanguages": { "haskell": "html" }, "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [ "class_ \"([^\"]*)" ], 
 I believe that the above regex should also work if you are using blaze-html instead of Lucid (but I have not tested it).
 Good luck! 
 Btw, here is an additional repo I found with info on Tailwind CSS in Haskell: https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk-tailwind-example

 It took a few tries but eventually the right way was to use GHCup on Ubuntu 21.10. Neovim + coc.nvim works, using the haskell-language-server as a back-end, and so does VSCode with remote ssh.
 cabal works. stack didn't (resource exhausted (No space left on device)), but stack seems to be a bit too much for a RPI on an SD card. 
 Of course it's not blazingly fast but I stubbornly wanted to get it up and running, and I did.
 I just felt like telling someone :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a fan of Cal Newport's work. He also seems to frequently produce high quality work (multiple best-selling books, consistent blog posts, articles for good publications, and a large number of academic papers).
In a recent podcast episode, Cal Newport made a distinction between proactive and reactive methods of information management.
Proactive information management attempts to takes information when first encountered and put it into some sort of knowledge management system (such as a Zettelkasten), maybe even before there is a specific "need" for it.  This information can then be retrieved at a later date, and new potentially novel connections can form between the information in the system.
He states his method of working is more reactive and project based, citing the overhead of inputting information to and maintaining such systems.
Reactive information management seems to be more on-demand and project based. When you are working on a particular project, you go out and find sources relevant to that article.
He also mentioned that over time (if you write enough) you will have been exposed to a lot of interesting ideas, and often when working on a project, a few potential starting points will come to mind which then you can follow to more relevant citations.
https://overcast.fm/+b1V0JshqM/34:55
One question when using a reactive project based method is what projects to work on? This is where I can see the value of novel connections in a Zetellkasten in generating ideas.
I'm curious what peoples' thoughts on this are?]]></summary>

 I also noticed that I have the following org-collect-keywords issue in my messages buffer:
 Saving file /home/kali/RoamNotes/20220107232234-programming_languages.org... Wrote /home/kali/RoamNotes/20220107232234-programming_languages.org org-roam-db--file-title: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-collect-keywords 
 So I am wondering exactly how to fix this issue and get the same results as in the tutorial?

 I'm trying to learn some elisp to customize some of org's behaviours. I'm reading through the elisp manual, so far so good.
 Now, I want to write some code and I'd like to write unit tests around it. What's the best way to do it? Are there any guides?
 In particular, I want to run my code against an org buffer, not entirely sure how to do that. I read this older post and while there are some good hints there I still have the questions above.

While I've been adding features to the package prior to this release (e.g., support for file marking, file mode/size/modification date info), this release makes a significant change to the UI, so I wanted to highlight it with a new version and this post.
 The main changes in version 1.1 are:

 I've been tweaking my multiple-cursors configuration a bit and want to use the <return> key to insert a newline (because I can never remember that I need to use <C-j> in multiple-cursors-mode.
 The documented solution is to set (define-key mc/keymap (kbd "<return>") nil). Running this command manually in my Emacs results in the desired behavior, but not when I add it to my init.el with use-package.
 I tried these two approaches:
  (use-package multiple-cursors :config (define-key mc/keymap (kbd "<return>") nil)) 
  (use-package multiple-cursors :bind ( :map mc/keymap ("<return>" . nil))) 
 In both cases, I get no errors / warnings when loading my init.el, but multiple-cursors-mode simply gets disabled when pressing <return>.
 Does anyone else have a similar setup or an idea how this can work?

 I'm a Vim user who loves the look of Org mode. This video has made me want to drop everything and learn it. However right now, I don't have the time to dedicate to learning Emacs at the moment, so I've become interested in the idea of just using it for Org mode and nothing else. My question is, if I don't care about any features of Emacs other than Org mode, what's the simplest way I can go about using it with Vim's navigation keys/modes?
 (I am aware there are a few different plugins for Vim/Neovim which attempt to emulate Org mode, but I've heard none of them come close to real Org mode)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a few weeks back I found spacemacs. Downloaded it and started to play with it. I realised quickly if I want to go down this rabbit hole I want to understand how emacs works. So I started reading and watching the excellent "System Crafters" video series with Emacs from scratch. I created my own init.el instead of spacemancs and today I created my first theme for Emacs (only graphical mode and alot is still missing).
 I feel that right now I spend more time configuring Emacs than actually using it (even if all configiration happends within emacs).
 I am also so happy that HaikuOS got its first fully native and functional emacs port. (also one of the reasons that I am trying to switch to emacs is that I can use it with the same look and feel and keybindings on every machine).
 The theme is based on catppuccin color scheme (using autothemer). Any suggestion of improvements?
 My config and theme can be found here. Dont judge my config, I've only used emacs for a few weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 For a couple of days, I've been trying to keybind SPC-SPC (now find-file or project-find-file) to a bottom popup that would display easy navigation to my files.
 Here's the simple popup code (works perfectly and gets activated upon "SPC e")
 (map! :leader (:prefix ("e" . "open config files") :desc "alacritty.yml" "a" #'(lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml")) :desc "nvim" "n" #'(lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/.config/nvim/init.vim")) :desc "polybar" "p" #'(lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/.config/polybar/config"))) 
 But I'd like to use "SPC SPC" instead of "SPC e". When I change :prefix from "e" to "SPC", I get: "Key sequence SPC starts with non-prefix key SPC. Is there a way to bind "SPC SPC" to a similar navigation?
 I managed to get "SPC SPC" execute "my-own-nav-function" (or any other function... see the code below), but then I'm stuck on a function definition.
 (map! :leader :desc "navigation function" "SPC" #'my-own-nav-function) 
 Can somebody help me please?
 Many thanks

This time, it's a real-world journey through realizing a project task that included error-prone screenshot and snippet creation to replace embedded Twitter HTML snippets with images + links (decentralize!). I tried to find a sweet-spot for semi-automating the task to make it as smooth as possible for me to replace the 85 snippets without going crazy or introduce too much errors.
 This should not be great news to anybody who is familiar with babel and shell scripts. For people who don't use either of them, it is probably a good use-case description how I'm using Org-mode to supplement generic tasks.

 I'm sorry if that is a recurrent question, but most answers I find seem to be out of date, especially after the release of the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2. I use Emacs with the Doom Emacs distribution on Linux (this is not set in stone, I can use Emacs without Doom if necessary), but I'm not a programmer or IT professional, so I'd like to get some opinions on how to best to install it on Windows 10, in such a way that I get an experience that is similar to what I get on Linux.
 Any suggestions? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently become involved in some qualitative research that involves using the program NVivo to analyse interview transcripts. Basically, the interview transcript is imported into NVivo, then you go read each sentence and attached thematic tag(s).
I think this would be an interesting way to organise research and notes, with the understanding that the tagging system would evolve over time.
For example,
If you are working on a specific article, you could browse through previous semi-related tags and tag sentences that might be relevant to that article.
Or if you are working on a longer project, tags could start general but then over time be refined and become more specific as you work out the structure of the project.
The only way I can think to implement something like this in existing note taking apps is to have one sentence per note, then as many required tags per note, but this seems unmanageable.
I'm curious what other think of this idea?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using multiple instances of Emacs at a time and working with Emacs bookmarks, there is a problem that bookmark entries can get lost. I.e. one instance might overwrite the fresh modified bookmarks file from another instance.
 Is there a good solution to this (besides being restricted to only one Emacs instance, or being careful)?
 I could imagine a package, which handles the bookmarks via an sqlite database. Or some elisp, which checks the bookmarks file regarding changes before writing to it.

 One more theme related quesition :)
 I am using custom theme (monotropic) and want to change color variable, say fg-light "#808080" to fg-light "#333". 
 I assumed it will be easy, but seems like it's not the case. When googling i found 2 methods:
  
patching old theme file https://stackoverflow.com/a/12886580
 
using custom-set-faces on the theme and saving them to init file (comment to the above link answer)
 
 Both seem not clean / tidy. I would like smng like color-theme-install-frame-params here https://superuser.com/a/482031, but it's custon function only for color theme.
 Is there a good way to do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to capture have a capture for a future meeting. I need two time-stamps for my ideal work-flow. 
 (1) A time-stamp in the headline or as part of a date-tree so that I can review my meetings (and the notes I took during the meeting) in chronological order. Really the big reason for this time-stamp is so that, when I am searching for meetings using consult-org-agenda I can distringuish multiple meetings all with headline "meeting with person X". 
 (2) I also need an active time-stamp so the meeting show ups in my agenda on the correct day. 
 These timestamps should be identical and should be set by prompting for a date during capture. 
 ​
 I would very much appreciate ideas on how to do this. I have seen the :time-promp option in the org-manual but not sure how to syncronize that with an active time-stamp (e.g., how to not be prompted for the date twice). Alternatively, if anyone has a better workflow or better idea I am very open to that as well. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Recently, I came up of an idea that we can practice natural language (for me, it's English) speaking using subtitle files, as they already have timestamps along with subtitle texts, so that we can loop over specific parts of a video file easily by taking advantage of those timestamps, instead of setting the start time and end time of the playback manually and then looping over it.
 And then I thought of a package, subed, which jumped into my eyes when I was wandering around Sacha Chua's blog (kudos to @sachac). And I found it was perfect for this idea after playing with it for ~10 minutes.
 Here are the steps: 1. Open a subtitle file, say foo.srt, subed will automatically open the accompany video file having the name foo.mp4/foo.mk4/foo.avi etc using mpv. 2. Then in the subtitle buffer, only these three key bindings will do the job: 1. C-c C-l toggles looping over the current subtitle By default, there is an extra second before and after the time span, as specified in the config subed-loop-seconds-before & subed-loop-seconds-after. 2. M-n moves the point to the next subtitle, and it automatically seek the playback to the corresponding timeline. 3. M-p moves the point to the previous subtitle and seek the playback to the right position of the timeline.
 Although the package is designed to be used to edit subtitles efficiently, it could also shine in language speaking/shadowing.
 If you're also learning foreign languages, I believe this workflow can help you.✌

 I'm trying to get a compacted view of the java classes in my project, something similar to the screenshot in the lsp-java Git repo (or the package explorer in Eclipse), instead of having a tree list with a hierarchy with all the folders. Ideally I would like to see whether a Java class has errors or not in that tree view. Do you know how?
 thanks!

 I was hoping that Emacs would finally support coloured emojis on Windows. However, when I compile Emacs myself off of master (29.0.5), with cairo installed using ming/pacman, and the --with-cairo flag set the ./configure output still shows that Emacs can't detect cairo (or can't use it in Windows). I'm curious if anyone else has figured out how to get Emacs to render color emojis on Windows or if that's something that's not supported yet?
 Maybe I'll be blessed an /u/eli-zaretskii can weight in.

 My use case is essentially that I'd like to have "concept art" in the margins of an org-mode note for creative writing, similar to how a lot of webpages are designed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I see that Lightbend is investing heavily in Akka (and Akka Serverless). I also noticed the hype around Akka for .Net. However, my experience with Akka has been one of a somewhat struggle and I am curious to know if things have changed in the last few years.
 My (only) attempt with Akka was 3-4 years ago when I wrote a web-service based on it. I remember how some things that would have been trivial if carried out with Future/Cats-effect/ZIO required quite a lot of coding in Akka. Two examples that I can think of:
 Concurrent requests:
 Some requests to the service required gathering information from several different actors asynchronously before returning a response. This required me to follow the "Aggregator Pattern": Sending the requests to the relevant actors and then changing context to accumulate (and keep track of) the responses . If I wanted to add an optional timeout I also had to set a timer with a Timeout message and cancel it once all responses arrived. It felt to me like this could have been more easily carried out with a Future.sequence(...) (if timeout is not necessary) or with parTraverse(...)/foreachPar(...) (Cats-effect/ZIO) with an optional .timeout(...) setting.
 Asynchronous execution:
 I many cases I found out that some synchronous tasks took longer than I initially thought, hurting my actor's responsiveness. However - if I decided to make those tasks asynchronous I had to write a new actor specifically for them. Compare this with wrapping a synchronous piece of code with a Future/IO/ZIO and it seems like a lot of boiler-plate for a relatively-simple refactor.
 What's common to both of those cases is the sense that I had to personally take care of behaviors that could/should have been abstracted away for me... 
 I was wondering if programming in Akka still feels so low-level...

 I am trying to generate a log of how the day was spent chronologically.
 Even with :step day or :block today, clocktable report give me an aggregate of time spent per task - but if I spend 1h on task A, then 20 min on task B, and then went back on task A, I can't find a way to generate a report that will basically reflect the order of the day.
 Any idea or suggestion which direction I could take for this?
 thanks!

The simplicity of The Archive really helps in my writing and making connections within my Zettelkasten. But sometimes I want a visual of my Zettelkasten and some added functionality to interact with my notes. This is where Obsidian comes in. Not to mention the mobile app as well on iOS makes entering things quickly, on the go, a breeze.
Does anyone else use these two brilliant applications in their workflow? Do you have any tips or tricks in using them together?]]></summary>

 I like Agda, but i'm not ready to wrap all browser features myself yet. Haskell or Idris don't seem to have easy to start web-app ecosystem, either. I was told that Elm doesn't have anything (?) for that beyond accessing js API, which i'm trying to avoid. As js-first and fairly mature language, i wonder if PureScript is a good choice?
 PS: i have basic js knowledge, but have a strong distaste for it and lack substantial for-browser coding. I tried PureScript a while ago, but didn't go beyond toying around, so i know i'm fine with the language, the question is only about environment/libs

 The conference is being organised in collaboration with Juspay and HasGeek, and will feature a full day of great talks by invited speakers! It will be held entirely online, and all the talks will (eventually) be made available for free access.
 The schedule is still being put together, and we'll release more details in the coming weeks. Please follow the PureConf conference page for updates.
 The conference is very modestly priced at 99 INR, or about 1.3 USD. While we have to charge a ticket price for various reasons, we have kept the ticket price very low to keep it accessible for everyone.
 Please feel free to contact me [ajnsit at google's email service] for any questions / feedback!
 See you all there!

 I am using monotropic theme and it makes modeline invisible (white) for non active buffers, i like it but would like to make small adjustment - to make modified element visible.
 I can easily do that for buffer id
 (custom-theme-set-faces
 'monotropic
 '(mode-line-buffer-id ((t (:foreground "#111111"))))
 )
 But it does not work for mode-line-modified, seems like cause it's not the face...
 I also learnt that i can specifically set color only for non active buffer situation, with :distant-foreground, but my problem is how to "select" modified element... Do i need to define it somehow to be able to select it?

flexible as possible by separating the definition of effects and their interpretation.
This is useful for many reasons, but especially for testing and mocking.
For example, instead of using an interpreter that runs a task over the network, one can swap it for an in-memory
implementation when running tests. This allows to test features in isolation.
To achieve this goal, effects should clearly convey functionality without exposing their implementation.
In many cases, this means exposing interpreters involving low-level constructs, such as IO, StateT or exceptions, only at the
outermost levels of the application.
However, for some kinds of effects, it can be hard to design an ex…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: After disabling the ligatures module in my doom emacs config altogether, turns out everything runs smooth again. While the auto-composition-mode is no longer guilty, my problem is still that ligatures have a very bad performance. I guess ligatures having bad performance in emacs are known, because they're mentioned in the doom FAQ.
 I recently installed emacs (doom) on a new manjaro installation and since I started using it I've been noticing that moving on a buffer and inserting text feels very laggy, and after a couple of minutes that becomes increasingly noticeable to the point where it's really hard to type, taking up to a couple of seconds to see the input being written on the screen.
 So I decided to investigate further into this, and tried disabling minor modes one by one, until I noticed the problem went away when I disabled the auto-composition-mode. I repeated the experiment disabling only that mode, just to be sure it wasn't because of some other mode that I failed to notice.
 I was wondering if there's something I could do about the performance of this mode. I know I could just disable it globally, but I would like to keep it enabled so the ligatures don't go away. I am using Fira Code.
 I'm using Emacs 29.0.5 (installed through the package emacs-git on AUR), with Harfbuzz.
 All help is very appreciated. Let me know if you need any more info.

 myLength [] = 0 myLength (x:xs) | xs == [] = 1 | otherwise = 1 + myLength xs 
 which offers this as the type definition when I ask it with :t
 myLength :: (Num p, Eq a) => [a] -> p 
 Adding to the code works. But then my own guess at writing my own definition didn't work, namely,
 myLength :: [a] -> Int 
 saying
 No instance for (Eq a) arising from a use of ‘==’ Possible fix: add (Eq a) to the context of the type signature for: myLength :: forall a. [a] -> Int 
 But if I change my code to
 myLength [] = 0 myLength (x:xs) | null xs = 1 | otherwise = 1 + myLength xs 
 myLength :: [a] -> Int seems to work. What under the hood is going on here? null has the type definition null :: Foldable t => t a -> Bool How does that change the situation, making my supposedly wrong definition right?

I was considering creating something like a sandboxed form of IO, but the fact that unsafePerformIO exists the level of isolation I want is not really feasible. I'd definitely appreciate if I could, say, dynamically compile and link these scripts for maximum performance, and have the scripting language just be Haskell. A core principal of this engine is that you may have multiple instances of a game being managed by the same process (for example, a server and client being run simultaneously, multiple servers, some of which might have different scripts, etc). A script could contain anything from a map file to a custom game mode, to say, admin commands, and I want these to have as much isolation from raw IO as I can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: it seems that there is no simple way how to check for changes not staged for commit and untracked files with Magit with use of elisp command (outside of the Magit GUI).
 Hi,
 I've made this simple function to commit and push all changes within some particular git repository from emacs, but there is a problem in case I run it twice (or when there is nothing to commit), because then there is nothing to commit, git-commit returns 1 which is treated as an error. It's not really an issue, but if that happens, I don't know if some real error happened or if it's just this.
 So I am wondering if somebody knows of any way how I could check if there are any changes to commit (whether there is any way of asking magit if there are any changes in git repository), so that I could run the commands only when there are some changes to commit.
 Code:
 (defun gitsync() "synces git repository" (interactive) (message "Synchronizing git repository...") (let ((default-directory "/path/to/git/repo/")) (magit-call-git "add" "-A" ".") (magit-call-git "commit" "-a" "-m" "\"commit msg\"") (magit-call-git "push")) (message "Synchronizing git repository... done")) 
 Edit: clarification

It started like this: The timestamp format 202201041342 is hard-wired into The Archive. I find 220104-1342 to be easier to grasp (as well as shorter). There are probably almost as many preferences for how to format an ID as there are users.

 This here is what I've done, as you can see, but I'm a newb and I'm not sure if this is correct, but it seems to work for me, so I'm just looking for some confirmation, or correction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, before my cake day on reddit, I was writing my Ph.D. thesis using LaTeX and Emacs as editor. One of my most common writing mistakes was to repetitively use words (say, word x appearing more than once in a 100 word radius, where it can be avoided). Looking for automated detection tools, I noticed a lack thereof, so I wrote my own (teaching myself elisp in the process). Just stumbled upon it today again and thought it might be of interest in r/emacs. https://github.com/ioah86/repetition_error_finder
 There are likely some bugs, but I hope people will find it useful as I did back then. Have fun 😀

 Have you tried browsing web using a keyboard? If you haven't yet, I suggest you give it a try. This idea is implemented as a plugin for all the major browsers. For Emacs, you can use emacs-webkit.

 The other day I merged an extension to integrate dtache with consult. The dtache is the package for detachable shell commands. The functionality is opt in, and provided through the dtache-consult.el. 
 This allows users of consult to conveniently narrow the list of dtache sessions. For an overview of the functionality see https://niklaseklund.gitlab.io/blog/posts/dtache_consult/
 Credit should also be given to minad who provided feedback on the implementation.

 I am new to Haskell and I need to install QuickCheck, but when I do I get the following error.

 I reinstalled Haskell the way my professor told me to and my Package List is up to date. Can anyone help me fix this?
 Thanks in advance :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After reading https://graphitemaster.github.io/aau/ I'm feeling that using signed integers in Haskell makes even less sense than in imperative languages, but unsigned integers (Words) are almost never used. It feels strange for correctness oriented language. I've looked at functions in Data.List and 4 out of 5 functions taking integer parameters (replicate, take, drop, splitAt) are actually doing n' = max n 0 with their argument, and only one ((!!)) throws an error with negative argument. In Data.Vector a ton of functions is taking integer parameters, and I've checked only the analogs of functions from Data.List and they behave the same (indexing throws, while other functions have this "wrap to 0" behavior for negative values).
 Isn't it sweeping problems under the rug? Does this convention have other reason than historical one?
 On the related issue: what is the underflow and overflow semantics in (GHC) Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, The more I play the guitar again, and the more I recognise about Emacs, org-mode and roam, and the more ideas I get.... Along with the more questions ... Jens Larsen is a very popular jazz guitarist, and pedagogue, he has recorded hundreds of videos available on his website and on Youtube, all with the material to learn or perfect your jazz art on the guitar. My idea would be to retrieve the names of the videos with the links (this should be possible by fiddling with the developer mode of Firefox on the page where he sums up the videos he already shared). Then I would ‏‏‎ like to create one note per title: - the name of the video becomes the file name - the note only contains a property #+Link: with link. Given that there are more than 800 videos, I would like to automate the process, but I do not know how to proceed. Could you please show me the way, and tell me how to create a script/macro in order to do it? I have started taking notes about my newly starting journey with the jazz guitar in org-roam, and I would like to be able to link my notes to the videos, and to search with deft. Any improvement /suggestions on the workflow is welcome! Thanks in advance for your help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phrasing a descriptive title was hard.
 I use ChkTeX as a flymake backend for checking my (La)TeX documents. ChkTeX is good, but sometimes gets things wrong (or makes suggestions which are not appropriate). Recognising this, it also reads a config file, and recognises certain magic comments, which can ignore warnings, or define new warning rules (it's a really amazing tool, check it out if you write TeX!).
 I recently had to write quite a few such magic comments, all in the same format, for ignoring different warnings (the comments are all very similar, just with a different diagnostic number in each). This quickly got boring, and this kind of programmatic text manipulation is exactly what emacs is good for. So I was about to write a set of functions like chktex-ignore-warning-at-pt and chktex-ignore-warning-at-pt-global (for writing to the config file).
 But then I thought that I can't be the first person to want to do this, and stuff like this (interacting with error information in configurable ways) surely can't be restricted to TeX. I thought there might something like a flymake-ignore-error-function variable, which I could set to my function, and there would be lots of flymake infrastructure for this -- but there isn't. Is there any such infrastructure already in emacs for interacting with errors in this way (ignoring, ignoring globally, finding docs etc. Of course, the specifics would have to be implemented in each specific backend)? I'm asking mostly because -- though it would be easy for me to just write my own functions and forget about it -- it seems like a useful general capability and if it doesn't exist yet, maybe it should? Would appreciate any thoughts.
 TIA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Setting org-catch-invisible-edits to non-nil works fine if you are pressing backspace to delete, aka you're at the end of the invisible region. But if you are at the beginning of the invisible region - just before the ellipsis - then it happily deletes the invisible text.
 Also when you delete all newlines after the header, so the following text should be added to the header, it does get added to the header... but as a new invisible region. That ellipsis can't be expanded with <tab> for some reason.
 Adding new characters from the start of the invisible region is correctly prevented.
 I tried searching emacs' issue tracker but it either gives me unhelpful errors or just doesn't do anything so I'm trying here instead.
 (emacs 27.2)
 edit: found a bug report from google. not sure if it's being handled: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2019-05/msg00133.html

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Emacs 27, and I'm using packages to load packages and customize to configure. How do I set up init.el so that Emacs will load a theme that is needed first, but then configure properly afterward?
 My example: Starting from scratch, I want to load monokai-theme from melpa and set it:
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t) (custom-set-variables '(custom-enabled-themes '(monokai)) '(custom-safe-themes '("d9646b131c4aa37f01f909fbdd5a9099389518eb68f25277ed19ba99adeb7279" default)) '(package-selected-packages '(monokai-theme))) (custom-set-faces ) 
 If monokai-theme is already downloaded, this works fine. But I want to have emacs download the package automatically if not already present. I use the following block:
 (when (not package-archive-contents) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install-selected-packages) ) 
 If I add this below the customize variables, it installs monokai-theme but doesn't load it. I need to restart emacs. If I add this above the customize variables, it doesn't work because package-selected-packages is not loaded yet.
 There's a catch-22 here since each piece needs the other to run first.
 I want to see if I can configure most things in customize, but maybe customize is not right for this job? Should I be using customize at all?

The problem is I can't use (or dunno how to) putStr in the show function as it returns an IO() and not a String. Surely there is a solution to this but I cant find it😭

        <link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/ru8uy0/iron_v120_is_out_happy_new_year/"/>
        <updated>2022-01-02T12:40:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.2.0.
 What is Iron ?
 Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.
 Here is a simple example: ```scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.log)
 log(-1d) //Compile-time error ```
 Features of 1.2.0
 Release 1.2.0 brings two key features: an imperative-styled DSL and constraints relations/consequences.
 Imperative DSL
 Iron brings a new imperative-styled DSL directly inspired by Martin Odersky's Representing Monad with Capabilities (HOPE 2021).
 Here is the "imperative" form of our log(x) method presented above: scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Raw[Double] = refined { Math.log(x) }  In this example, x is automatically unboxed via an implicit conversion only available inside refined and Math.log(x) is automatically boxed into a new Constrained.
 Capabilities work for other kind of monads. If you want to use capabilities in your project, I highly suggest you to watch the talk linked above.
 Consequences
 A consequence has basically a definition analoguous to logical implication => (do not confuse it with Scala's functions). It is used to convert a Constrained value to another Constrained.
 While a default implementation exists for all conversions, this new typeclass allows you to define specific relations (like transitivity, reflexivity etc...) that have two major benefits: - Check some conversions at compile-time where (for example, we know that a constrained value A / B can't be converted to A / Not[B]). - Avoid unnecessary evaluations at runtime.
 Note that Consequences are not exclusive to mathematical/numerical values.
 That's all for this release. For further information, check the release on Github.
 Happy new year!

 Is there any way I can customize any project-wide swiper search like counsel-rg to search all files in a project, but prioritize open buffers over persistent files? Preferably without using projectile.

 In my previous GNU/Linux distribution I was using Emacs 28 but in the package repos of my current one (Void Linux), Emacs 28 is not there (https://voidlinux.org/packages/?arch=x86_64&q=emacs).
 I miss some of its features. That's why I would like to compile it from source. I know a lot of you guys do this: which is your criteria to chose a branch or tag from which to compile, from the Emacs repo? (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/tree/master)
 I want to use the latest more or less stable version possible, not the most bleeding edge one possible. Since I don't want to potentially run into errors on a daily basis or anything like that.
 Should I go for the latest tag possible, i.e. emacs-28.0.90? If I understand correctly, tags are meant to indicate each latest stable version, don't they? Or should I go for the HEAD of any specific branch?
 Thanks a lot in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things that amazes me about Haskell is the rabbit holes I'm ceaselessly cascading down. For example, what I thought was an innocent question turned out to be my latest rabbit hole, i.e. apparently Haskell doesn't have real recursive types. Apparently, what I thought was a recursive type, e.g.
 data Peano = Zero | Succ Peano 
 is not really a recursive type, although I'm not sure why. My previous question about what turned out to be the omega combinator brought up the true nature of Haskell recursive types and the mysterious newtype "workaround". So this talks about a real natural number recursive type (as does my previous question)
 MyNat = One :+: MyNat 
 MyList a = One :+: (a :*: MyList a)
 I can't truly fathom what's being done/said here, e.g., no idea what is meant first paragraph in by a typed tagless-final interpreter. Simple blind acceptance, which is just hand-waving, isn't my style. And the logic programming course it references is, well, my latest rabbit hole. Can somebody give me some intro material to this whole issue of what really is a recursive type. This all started, BTW, with trying to understand what a type equation meant. Can you guess how many pdfs and web pages I've opened since then? Fazit: Somebody (me?) needs to pull all these threads together into one big Haskell-Omni textbook. The existing beginner texts are too handwavy, IMHO. There's a kiddie version of Haskell and a grownup's version. The kiddie version is pretty much useless, again, IMHO, unless it's to spur you on to the bigger stuff.

 This just cost me fiveten minutes of my life (only because I have gotten used to it, having been broken multiple times now from main branch renames in various projects).
 I am here to complain and perhaps save some time for anyone else who contributes to Org mode or uses the source occasionally.
 If you're still tracking master, you're missing commits.

 (λx . xxx)(λx . xxx)(λx . xxx) 
 How could they be done as Haskell anonymous functions? I've got this in a similar vein perhaps
 let x = a in let y = λz.x in let x = b in y x 
 But I've mixed in the parts I can't fathom in Haskell, i.e., the λz.x and y x This isn't it (\x -> \x -> x)
 which is, if I'm not mistaken (λxx . x); it just takes two inputs and returns the second; and this doesn't seem to be allowed (\x -> x x) so I'm stuck.

Semantically this makes perfect sense; it is exactly what I want to do. However, my agenda for the day doesn't distinguish between the two, so it can be confusing when I look for my daily TODO items. Is there a trick to getting the scheduled and deadline agenda entries to display differently on today's agenda, or should a feature request be made?

 Is there any way to use global-prettify-symbols-mode and not have it change all TODO keywords to checkboxes? When marked as DONE, the checkboxes turn into a 'ticked' checkbox that I find very ugly. I am wondering if there is some variable I can set in the init which will get rid of this substitution while keeping the global mode on, as I do prettify a lot of other things.

 Does anyone have experience with gui version (emacs-x), is it stable?
 Or should i stick to terminal and try to do bindings more terminal friendly?

 I try to run:

 Result:

 Then, without (knowingly) changing anything it will start to work. I'm convinced emacs just wants to see me scramble to the internet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The doc for (setq-default indicate-empty-lines t) is confusing for me. C-h v indicate-empty-lines tells "Visually indicate empty lines after the buffer end." But how can you have empty lines after the buffer end? There is nothing after the buffer end!
 Take a look at this screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/tzcDdYKl.png Line 10 is the last line of the buffer. There is nothing after Line 10. The fringe bitmap indicator shows the void (limbo?) after the end of the buffer. But the doc refers to this void (limbo lines) as "empty lines". Why?
 Aren't Lines 6-10 empty lines? Lines 6-10 are actual lines that contain nothing but \n. Aren't these the empty lines - the blank lines?
 Isn't everything after Line 10 limbo? visual representation of lines that don't exist / end of buffer? Help me understand the Emacs terminology? Why lines that don't exist are called "empty lines"?

In the same hour I thrown off everything about who did it and where to find tips and solutions (actually, I even doesn't remember if I had this information) and took it apart without trying to remember. Then I waited for some time to forget everything and then I found that this puzzle is a bit more complex than I thought about it.
 So I decided to write some code (surely using Haskell) to solve it. And today I did it.
 Here is repository:

 But I have a question: is it possible to make it faster and not using so much memory?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for the wall of text, but I've been reading a lot of guides and not really getting the answer I need. If anyone wants to help a complete newcomer, I could really use it.
 I've read some monad tutorials/lectures and I think I have a beginner's understanding. Basically what I took away was "without unsafePerformIO, which you should not use, Monad types like M a can't be converted to a. Instead you compose your Monad functions with pure functions using operators like <$> or >>=." I also think I understand this distinction between "pure" and "monad" functions helps the haskell compiler be extremely cool.
 That sounds really good, but I'm having trouble understanding how to structure an application around this. I'm trying to teach myself Haskell by writing an interactive fiction game. So far I have an RPG-style dice roller written, but it's deterministic. I'm creating a seed from the system time inside of a do, using the <- operator. I then use (basically) randomRs (_,_) (mkStdGen seed). Because I used do and I wasn't sure what to do after that though, so I tried using unsafePerformIO and I'm almost certain this is why my dice roller rolls the same numbers every time.
 Do I have to make all my roll-processing functions and the entire skill system speak IO Int and pass up and down an updated stdGen? I am pretty sure the answer is "no," since I can use bind to invoke pure functions. But if that's true, I'm not sure how to apply that while designing a whole application.
 I guess what I'm unsure of is how to structure something larger than a few functions around all of this. Does anyone have any favorite guides or wisdom about the big-picture structure of an application written in Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on a Mac (El Capitan). With a little recent help from the emacs.stackexchange.com forum participants, I have written up a few Emacs functions to refresh the TD Ameritrade access token for its API, and to submit custom buy/sell orders for equities (although it could be for options trading too, but that's not my cup of tea). At some point in the future, I hope to write Lisp code to stream TDA data using the API and make trading decisions from within Emacs. For the near foreseeable future, however, I'll be relying upon watching the Thinkorswim desktop application to make decisions to buy/sell. Screen real estate is precious, as I need to see the charts, studies, order flow, etc.
 In a nutshell, I only need to tell Emacs: 50.35 RET and then perhaps 15 seconds later 51.25 RET. I have installed KeyboardMaestro, for systemwide keyboard shortcuts offering a variety of options, including executing scripts and so forth.
 I have two (2) Emacs options for order submission, either calling the curl executable, or running url-retrieve-synchronously.
 Any ideas regarding how to do this Emacs order entry quickly and save screen real estate would be greatly appreciated.
 BACKGROUND: There are certain custom orders available through TDA that cannot be executed programmatically from within Thinkorswim, but that should be possible through the API. Speed is the key as I am interested in momentum trades with high volatility.

 I'm using the Emacs packages simpleclip to copy to clipboard, and shell-pop to open up a terminal in Emacs quickly with a keybinding.
 Anyways, I can copy text from the terminal to the clipboard, but whenever I try to past into the terminal, it throws the error:
 ​
 `Buffer is read-only: #<buffer \*ansi-term-1\*>`
 ​
 So how do I fix this issue? I use the emacs package use-package in my .emacs config, so I'm trying to figure out what lisp code is required to fix this issue, so that I can paste into the terminal in emacs.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for the help!

 I've updated the example. It now uses nix flakes. The elisp files can be maintained as a dirty tree for happy hacking. Home manager is mainly used for the static aspects of user home integration rather than installing the elisp files read-only. I will be installing this on a Darwin machine sometime today.
 The Scheme
  
Straight for elisp packages & lockfiles
 Home manager for dotfiles
 Nix expressions for distributing 3rd party deps
  
Forewarning, the Emacs lisp is not marketed as good. At anything. My git tree is dirty. I mainly use the vterm integration and Rust Analyzer.
 The Future
  
Emacs can maintain its own nix profile to have a self-contained set of 3rd party dependencies like language servers and dynamic modules independently of the user environment
 Emacs can generate a home manager module for programs like vterm that want home integration
 Emacs can maintain non-package elisp configuration expressions without resorting to rigid git managed structures or rapidly decaying patchworks lifted from literate org files scattered around
  
The mix of tooling is the main work output of this project so far. Appreciate pointing out any work related to the Future

 I'm an undergrad student very interested in Haskell and functional programming in general. Doing some stuff in my spare time, however, isn't quite satisfying and I want to learn more, especially how it would look to write actual production Haskell. 
 That is why I would like to apply for an internship or job in Haskell. But here comes the problem: 
 All job offers for Haskell programmers either require years of experience with Haskell in production and/or a PhD. 
 I think this is a problem because: 
  
If nobody offers a job for beginners to work with Haskell, how does the community want to get new people who have worked years in Haskell that don't come from academia?

You don't need to install any external packages, just compile the newest source code of Emacs (at least newer than this commit by Po Lu) with "--with-pgtk" together with "--with-xwidgets" flags. Then M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url and enter a url, you could surf the Internet via Emacs!
 For people not familiar to this: pgtk port is the feature Emacs use pure GTK, which means it could run under pure Wayland. Xwidgets is a feature that allows Emacs to display GTK and NS widgets inside buffers. Xwidgets doesn't support pgtk before, Po Lu made it support pgtk.

 Writing a shell script, Emacs adds 4 tabs and 1 space. I don’t want this to happen. I want Emacs to go to the first character in the previous line. Emacs is going wild with auto-formatting. I want electricity. I like electricity. But I don’t like auto-formatting. That is, I don’t like tons of random tabs and spaces added for no reason.
 for in i in 1 2 <tab><tab><tab><tab><space><cursor is now here> 
 I don’t want that. I want :
 for in i 1 2 <cursor is here> 
 M-x electric-indent-mode doesn’t work, because then I lose electricity, which is also problematic. I like electricity, but I don’t like auto-formatting. Turning off electricity isn’t good:
 for in i 1 2 do <cursor is here> 
 I want the cursor to be aligned with the do, not at the beginning of the line. Does anyone know how to do this?

 What a wonderful gift to the emacs community to end out a difficult (I would say horrible) year and end it with hope and optimism going into 2022.

 It works well but I recently found out that the default indentation is only 2 space char. I would like to have it inserting 4 chars width TABS. I tried to look in the customization group of indent.el and even used kernel coding style emacs config, which works when I press <TAB> but doesn't when using (indent-buffer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellow 'macsers,
 TL;DR: Can you tell me which function emacs invokes to ask for auth data?
 I recently heard of mini-frame-mode and fell in love. While I see the need to have a vertical display for functions and variable descriptions (marginalia ftw!), I have always been irritated by a new buffer appearing "out of nowhere" on the bottom of my screen, moving the modeline etc.
 So, I have adjusted the looks of mini-frame-mode to my liking. Now, there is one piece missing: whenever I push to my git repository, mini-frame-mode opens to prompt me for my git auth data. I don't want mini-frame-mode to handle this; instead, I want the password prompt to appear in the original mini buffer on the bottom.
 I know of the mini-frame-ignore-commands variable. However, I don't know which program is evoked by emacs to ask me for the password. I tried skimming the Messages Buffer for it, but adding magit-process-username-prompt and magit-process-password-prompt to the list didn't change anything, and I was unable to find a reference to another function in the packages' code.
 Thus: can you tell me which function emacs invokes to ask for auth data?
 Have a good day, folks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have observed some strange GHC behavior while working on my $DAYJOB project that I'd like to report as an issue on the GHC bug tracker. To do so, I intend to prepare a minimal case that reproduces the issue on the compiler version that the GHC developers would most prefer. I'm having trouble doing that though:
 1) Which is the GHC version that would be the most useful for GHC developers? 8.10.7, the one the majority of the users currently use (me included)? 9.2.1 which is the latest stable release? Or GHC HEAD? 
 2) Unless the answer to (1) above is GHC 8.10.7, what's the easiest way to obtain that GHC version, very preferably without polluting my system globally? I've built GHC HEAD using the great nix-shell provided by https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix, which allowed me to build it without installing any system dependencies globally. But I can't figure out how to run the resulting GHC, I have ./inplace/bin/runghc which I can use to interpret .hs files and I have ./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2, but that one results in a billion linker errors when I try to compile anything. I've also tried installing GHC versions via ghcup, but that one also fails because I think I'm supposed to install some system dependencies, but I really don't like doing that if at all possible.
 It might be a good idea to update the report a bug page in the GHC wiki with this information. This subreddit is probably not the best place to ask these questions, but I'm also not sure where best to engage with the GHC developers.
 Thanks for any pointers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello haskellers,
 I know this question has been asked in the past, but I'm hoping to get a more modern answer :')
 Are there any recommended resources for learning category theory and haskell?
 Some background info, I have a math undergrad degree, and I had fun with the pure math, proofs, theorems, etc. so I'd love to dive deeper into the formal math behind category theory.
 After graduating, I've had a few different roles before landing a software engineer position about 6 months ago... mainly working with JavaScript/TypeScript/node.js.
 I've also worked through the JavaScript Mostly Adequate Guide to FP, which further piqued my interest in FP, also learned some basic Clojure and used it for Advent of Code this year.
 Has anyone worked through the MIT course, Programming with Categories? Does this seem like a good place to start? Leafing through the textbook, it seems to strike a good balance between the formal math and introducing haskell basics. I was thinking of working through it, then work through a more in-depth haskell resource after (i.e. learn you a haskell or something).
 What did you use to learn category theory and/or haskell?
 Thanks in advance for your input!

There are 4 different labs in Go lang I plan to redo in Scala (MapReduce, Raft, Fault-tolerant Key/Value Service, Sharded Key/Value Service). There is also a bunch of lectures available on YouTube: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html. I would like to know if there is any interest in forming a study group to motivate each other to complete this course and work on the labs together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on my "adulting." I'm reviewing and setting habits to help guide me in times of lower clarity. Looking at ideas for creating a tool for thinking, I came up with a tool that prompts me to refine the edits to zettel titles and 'summary relevance.'
This 'tool for thinking' results from a python program tied to Keyboard Maestro that prompts me to review titles and summaries of the last ten days of newly created zettel. As an anchor, it is tied to my practice of morning journaling. It reminds me and makes it convenient to examine each zettel title and the one-sentence 'relevance' statement to see if it makes sense and stands up to scrutiny. This is added to the bottom of that template. (pictured below) Automatic, easy peasy, the cognitive load of the initiating behavior habit off-loaded to the computer. This is not an excuse for not editing the body of each zettel. A new zettel will be on the list for ten days. That means ten opportunities for giving the zettel some love.
I'm unsettled on the format. In its current form it is a bit hard to read. I will make changes for readability.
If you're interested in how this is done, have questions about my use-case, or just want to chat let me know.
Below are pictured titles and a one-sentence summary/meaning of the zettel I'm working on. These are the ideas I'm currently wrestling with. They represent a ten-day window of new zettel.
This is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list. If any of this is of interest to you, please start a thread here, DM me, or get in touch via email.]]></summary>

Start pen, open a text file, python, elisp, etc. and run lsp. Anyway, I'm going to continue working on this into next year.

 I use straight.el to manage packages. I also use use-package for configuration. I have use-package configured to use straight.el. I'm using the development version org-mode, which was fantastic, until Emacs 28 started shipping with v9.5, which is all I need. The built-in version seems to load much quicker than the one I have. (I'm not byte compiling my init files; maybe I should do that?) Is there a way to make use-package use the built-in version of org-mode even though I've got straight-use-package-by-default set to t?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When creating tasks using org-capture, I try to provide as much context as i can, so it might take 2-3 mins to create one task. this would make my agenda look messy because of these tasks with short clocked time. 
 ​
 I wonder if there's an easy way to create a function/hook that removes the clock drawer if the clocked minute is less than a threshold, say 5 mins?
 ​
 There is something similar in org-mode already, when the variable org-clock-out-remove-zero-time-clocks is set to true, empty clock drawers are removed after org-clock-out.

 How can I remove it since lot of unwanted features already enabled which I don't want.

 Also I can see the lag while switching buffers and in execution while using spacemacs.

Highlight syntax is okay inside the block but when I execute with C - c C - c I get this: "No org babel execute function for sclang". Sclang seems to be supported by Babel and Org (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html) but since it was working there is no doubt sclang is supported anyways. I am also ensuring that a working installation of sclang is functional and on when executing the block. 
 I am also setting it to (require 'sclang) before anything, so cannot think anything else. Executable of the lang is declared as well and functioning okay! 
 All in all, the language is working in its mode so there is nothing else that points a reason to investigate and also when trying other languages in such as js it works okay with results appearing as expected outside the source block.
 #+begin_src js console.log("hello") #+end_src #+RESULTS: : hello : undefined 
 I have activated sclang using this below:
 (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((sclang . t)))
