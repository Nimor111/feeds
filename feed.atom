 is it possible to change the time of an item from within the agenda?
 for example say you have the following in an org agenda file
 ** call Boss <2023-08-21 Mon 11:50> 
 i know you can change the date/time from the the .org file.
 you can also change the date from the agenda view.
 Is there a way to change the time (say from 11:50 to 11:55) from the agenda view?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The code for this sucks, I know. But here's a tweak to my Emacs which I find so incredibly useful I want to share it with you. I call it "electric M-m". Essentially, it makes M-m skip more than just whitespace. So it skips the //, # and ;; at the start of code comments, and also skips the *** TODO [1/10] at the start of Org mode headers. So it skips up to the first bit of proper text. By adding things to skip-prefixes-alist, you can extend this easily to more modes. I've been using this for a few years now and I'm happy with how it works.
 Anyway, here's the code:
 (let ((c-like '("//+!?" "/?\\*+")) (lisp '(";+")) (org-header-regexp (rx bol (+ "*") (+ space) ;; I know this is a filthy way of doing the keywords but I just can't ;; be bothered to do it properly. (? (or "TODO" "NOW" "DONE" "D…]]></summary>

 The most significant thing in this release is introducing a compiler plugin with experimental support of direct context encoding. 
 // The idea of a direct context encoding is briefly described in 
 https://rssh.github.io/dotty-cps-async/BasicUsage.html#direct-context-encoding-experimental 
 This brings into the Scala API possibility to use a direct style model, similar to the Kotlin suspended function approach.
 Connected change: automatic coloring is deprecated in favor of the upcoming direct context encoding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am getting started on using Zettelkasten. Here is one of my zettels, the purpose here is to capture concepts in Indian philosophy and discover connections. I look forward to your critiques/feedback:
In Indian philosophy, light can be understood as both physical and metaphysical. 

Prakasha refers to manifested light. There are three types: 
* ordinary fire (_jada agni_), 
* sunlight (_saura agni_), 
* lightning (_vaidyuta agni_).

The original spiritual light is _jyoti_. 

How does physical light interface with the metaphysical?
* Physical light sustains life on Earth, for example, sunlight provides energy through photosynthesis. 
* [[Prometheus stole fire and was punished for giving power to humans]]
* Light enables creation, as consciousness is the first element required.  
* Light is involved in metaphysical visions too:
1._Krishna_ grants _Arjuna_ a glimpse of his effulgent divine form, which _Sanjay_ also perceives through inner sight. 
2. The _Nachiketa_ and _Yama_ story conveys spiritual light's ability to illuminate the knowledge of death and immortality.

 It seems that others have had this thought as well:

I have a similar problem with "I'm". These modifiers work fine in math mode, and typing e.g. "it's" is fine too.
 If I show the list of available modifiers by '?, t and m are both there, with blanks next to them, which I presume should mean (as the documentation suggests) that 't should just produce 't - or should it actually be showing something nonempty?

 Warning: I am a relative noob, so I might say something stupid.
 I am trying to use tree-sitter and eglot, and setup as emacs as my IDE for python. Specifically, the minimum features I'd like to have are:
  
Syntax and variable highlighting, e.g., if I am using a variable it doesn't exist anywhere, it should be highlighted, highlight functions with a color, etc.
 Completion of libraries, but also of variables, e.g., if the variable old_array exists, then I'd like to type `old` the hit tab (or something) and have emacs complete the rest.
 Also, something (like flymake) that highlights syntax errors

If flymake has some new update why can't you just get that updated at the same as the third party packages you have installed?

 So far, I've come across Bozhidar's[1] post, which has been quite helpful. What's currently bothering me the most are:
 1) Non-functioning keyboard shortcuts like "Super + arrows" for window manipulation. This is a known bug[2] across all WSLg applications due to the lack of support for this mechanism in non-native Windows' windows.
 2) The inability to open files in the Windows system using Emacs (WSL2). This is particularly frustrating for Org files, of which I have quite a few on my disk.
 3) Duplicate icon on the taskbar. I know it's a minor issue, but it's quite annoying. When I pin a shortcut for Emacs using "Pin to taskbar," then open Emacs using the shortcut, it doesn't "overlay" the pinned application. Instead, a new icon appears next to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to import Yaml and keep the order but the module Data.Yaml uses the Data.Aeson.Keymap type which is unordered. i only need the top level key-map to be ordered.
 What would be a decent way to preserve the order of my yaml file? Should I parse it for a second time and restore to get the order of my keys or can you think of a better approach?
 Edit:
 A solution is to create a list from the same file using this unreadable line of Haskell code:
 let keys = map (fromText . Data.Text.init . decodeUtf8) . filter (not . isSpace . BS.head) . BS.lines $ content 
 where BS is my ByteString import. I can then later map over the keys list and lookup the yaml KeyMap in the right order.
 This solution feels a bit like a hack. So I wonder how you would solve this.
 Also, how would you make that huge line more readable?

 inline def recurser[T <: Tuple](inline t: T): List[String] = inline t match case _: EmptyTuple => Nil case t: (head *: tail) => val h = dispatcher(t.head) h :: recurser(t.tail) inline def dispatcher[T](inline t: T): String = inline t match case t: Product => val m = summonInline[Mirror.ProductOf[T & Product]] val tup = Tuple.fromProductTyped(t)(using m) recurser(tup).mkString("[", ", ", "]") case _ => t.toString 
 This compiles. However, calling dispatcher on a product type doesn't: 
 dispatcher(1) // works dispatcher(1, 2, 3) // doesn't :( 
 The compiler cannot perform the match in `recurser`: 
 cannot reduce inline match with scrutinee: tup : (tup : m.MirroredElemTypes) patterns : case _:EmptyTuple case t @ _:*:[head @ _, tail @ _] 
 Why is that? Everything seems precisely typed and inlined. Are there any workarounds? I know this particular example can be solved with givens, I'm exploring a given-less design space.

 Thanks in advance :)

Two reasons, first, frameworks simplify onboarding because you can now teach to the framework; the new programmer can be taught only the Haskell needed to operate the framework, and then "proper" Haskell later.
 ​
 We can do this already, but then you have to decide what dialect of Haskell you're aiming to (there are TONS of Simple Haskells in use), and then get annoyed when new hires with Haskell experience get annoyed that your dialect doesn't match their dialect.

 Second, I've compared a framework-centric approach to a keto-diet, in that it lets you cheat. Boring Haskell means to limit your use of language extensions to the absolutely "crucial", which Boring Hask…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried turning on `lsp-ui-sideline-mode` and noticed that some entries in the sideline are split on two lines:
 https://preview.redd.it/e6dct4kqb4jb1.png?width=1265&format=png&auto=webp&s=116651f45bdfd91df114422aadb515c4185d52a0
 I suspect what I'm seeing is what's described in #285. However, the fix described there, to modify `markdown-code-face`,
  (custom-set-faces '(markdown-code-face ((t (:inherit default))))) 
 doesn't make any difference.
 My font settings are
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Iosevka" :height 110 :weight 'normal) (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "Iosevka" :height 110 :weight 'normal) (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "Cantarell" :height 110 :weight 'regular) 
 Any suggestions what else to try?
 Could it be something related to my running a PGTK build?

I'm exploring using my structure notes as a thinking canvas.
How the effectiveness of a targeted review practice intersects with active cognition.
Humor
I think that THE key to zettelkasting is every zettel is a proxy for an idea, and the only thing that matters is zettel relatedness to other zettel. Discovery of the scaffolding of zettel relatedness is something that grows organically but can be nurtured as a gardener cares for her flowers, fruits, and veggies. Different strategies will tickle out the relatedness.
How to discover which zettel has the most pixie dust of magic at the moment. I'm getting further on my quest to weigh each zettel by measuring their use and connectivity.
The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.

 I recently (very recently) got hooked on Doom EMACS, and from all the videos I've watched I see how powerful it is. I mainly want to use the org mode, and I encounter four major difficulties :
  
I don't really know how to enter "Insert mode" in an ORG buffer, I just start typing random things until the cursor turns from a box to a line ;
 I don't know how to type special characters like = # = on a buffer, cause Im on Mac and I need to press ALT+3, and that's a keybinding to switch between workspaces;
 I can't really press TAB to show/hide content of headlines, all it does is it adds an extra tabulation (Demoting the headline) ;
 I don't know how to change the headline ticks.
  
Can someone please show me how to do all these things, cause Chat GPT is giving me some nonsense responses.

 I've recently embarked on my Haskell learning journey and have acquired the book "Effective Haskell". However, as I want to delve deeper, I feel like I'm missing some of the mathematical foundations upon which functional programming is based. I don't only want to know the HOW, but also the WHY.
 A bit about me: I'm currently in the 5th semester of Applied Computer Science, so I have a foundational understanding of mathematics. However, I'd like to bridge the gap between my current knowledge and what's required to truly grasp the concepts in Haskell.
 Could any of you recommend books or resources that elucidate the mathematical principles essential for Haskell? I'm particularly interested in materials that would fit well with someone at my academic stage and can help me connect the dots between math and functional programming.
 Thanks in advance for your suggestions!

Currently I just have a basic html and css file and it's still very minimal but I am wondering if I should incorporate something like php to be able to make blog posts in markdown or org mode rather.
 I do not have very much experience in web dev but am pretty decent in other back end and system languages and find php to be sorta similar to bash. Creating a blog from scratch kinda seems like the long route to a simple solution but it's more of a learning experience as well as having control over the skeletal structure and knowing whats behind everything. This will also give me control over the customization of the pages. Any help would be greatly appreciated thank you 
 EDIT: After a few responses and reading over a couple tutorials I've learned you can basically build your own blog directly in Emacs. No php required ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 So I'm in the process of figuring out how I can sync my phone notes to my local file server with Synching occasionally. Basically 'phonenotes.org' from one machine to another. That being noted, I have another file called notes.org on my file server that basically lists completed tasks under a following format:
 ```
 *COMPLETED TASKS 2023
 ** Week of 08-14-2023
 *** Date
 Completed task summary
 ```
 In my actual phone notes file, I have this for an example:
 ```
 Title: 08-15-2023
 Recorded music
 ```
 With this in mind, how do I facilitate the ability to routinely ingest any of the notes that are date based on the phone note title itself from Orgzly so that it automatically determines the Monday of the given week, creates a 'Week of (Starting Monday of that week)' subheading in the 'notes.org' file and slams that new note in there?
 Sorry if it sounds complicated but I do this manually all the time and I wanted an easier way to do this programatically with Org Mode.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am trying to figure out a way to define an interactive function that:
  
Prompts a list of bibliography from a bibtex source file for selection.
 Based on the selected citation, populate an org-roam template involving the citation title, author names, etc.
  
I have tried to follow this guide which uses org-cite and citar, and got it somewhat working by modifying their org-roam-node-from-cite function, but I couldn't get it working completely because there seems to have been some API changes in citar that broke the code as it is.
 I have also seen this guide using org-ref, but I would like to stick to the built-in org-cite if possible. Any help is appreciated, thanks!
 My current function modified from Kristoffer's guide: ``` ;; Create a new node from a bibliographic source. taken from ;; https://jethrokuan.github.io/org-roam-guide/ (defun org-roam-node-from-cite (keys-entries) (interactive (list (citar-select-refs :multiple nil))) (let ((title (citar-format--entry (cdr '(keys-entries nil)) "${author editor}${date urldate} :: ${title}"))) (org-roam-capture- :templates '(("r" "reference" plain "%?" :if-new (file+head "references/${citekey}.org" ":properties: :roam_refs: [cite:@${citekey}] :end:
 +title: ${title}
 +filetags: %(insert-lit-category)\n")
  :immediate-finish t :unnarrowed t)) :info (list :citekey (car keys-entries)) :node (org-roam-node-create :title title) :props '(:finalize find-file))))

 I'm using emacs centaur which is using project (and not projectile).
 For a small hello project, I could solve a first issue of LSP folder path :
 How to remind lsp-workspace-folder (+ to be used by DAP) ? : emacs (reddit.com) 
 Now, I'm on project with several sub folders with their own compile_commands.json, .git ....
 There is also a compile_commands.json on root, the most important.
 I created an empty .project file on root to try to solve the problem. I thought it should be the same that for .projectile. 
 I do project-switch-project and choose directory on root.
 I select the file I need with compile_commands.json on root.
 The LSP folder workspace is starting with compile_commands.json on a sub folder ... 
 Even with .project + (setq lsp-auto-guess-root t) in custom-post.el + remove compile_commands.json of the sub-folder used + delete of sub-folder with lsp-workspace-folder-remove + add of root with with lsp-workspace-folders-add
 I still have the sub-folder selected for project and lsp-workspace-folder ... 
 Please, if you have advice to solve this issue to force to declare a project directory and not auto-detect the git project of the file selected ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi people,
 After months of previous attempt on using DOOM Emacs, I'm trying to give Emacs a new try but this time with my own configuration and no Evil in the mix.
 I saw the fantastic news about the Emacs 29.1 major version, like having Eglot and Treesit built-in; so I decided to give it a try, but unfortunately no success :( 
 When I run the treesit-install-language-grammar I receive the following error.
  Warning (treesit): Error encountered when installing language grammar: (file-missing Setting current directory No such file or directory /tmp/treesit-workdir1YJ0sh/repo/src) 
 After checking the temporary folder I could find that is empty, seems like not even the git clone is executed.
 Anyone already faced this issue and was able to solve, or have any idea of what is happening.
 Thanks

 ​
 I just found out about this function to detangle from the source code to the main org file. However, I cannot do this in my configuration (doom-emacs), having an error message saying that 0 code blocks were detangled. I am using the `:comments link` option as well.
 When I tried launching emacs with -Q flag, it didn't find this function. 
 ​
 Does anyone else have a similar issue? Does anyone use it?
 I didn't find any alternative to this feature as well.
 ​
 Many thanks!

However, this has been very painful because I sometimes lose connection (for example if put my Emacs into sleep mode) and then Tramp freezes emacs and I see a message: "Tramp: Openning connection nil for HOSTNAME"
 I then have to kill emacs and restart.
 Is there a way to make Tramp more robust to connections dropping?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on Windows 10 btw.
 I'm following this tutorial for Clojure: https://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/
 I follow these instructions:
 Do the following to delete your existing Emacs configuration and install the Clojure-friendly one:
  
Close Emacs.
 Delete ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d if they exist. (Windows users, your emacs files will probably live in C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\. So, for example, you would delete C:\Users\jason\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d.) This is where Emacs looks for configuration files, and deleting these files and directories will ensure that you start with a clean slate.
 Download the Emacs configuration zip file listed above and unzip it. Its contents should be a folder, emacs-for-clojure-book1. Run mv path/to/emacs-for-clojure-book1 ~/.emacs.d.
 Open Emacs.
  
When you open Emacs, you may see a lot of activity as Emacs downloads a bunch of useful packages.
 I am able to complete the steps, however I see no activity and nothing being downloaded when I reopen EMACS. Just the regular EMACS screen with the logo.
 Anyone know what I am doing wrong ?
 Here is the file I moved to the .emacs.d folder per the tutorial

 But now in Emacs 28.2 I'm getting next error:
 error: Recursive load, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el 
 https://pastebin.com/CDjLseT2 - Here is my init.org. What's wrong with that? It is actually was "working" configuration untill one day it stoped.
 P.S.: Actually it behave weird after deleting all tmp files and reboot it literaly takes all the configuration from the init.org and putting it into init.el replacing the:
 (require 'org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "init.org" user-emacs-directory)) 
 Is that a bug or new feature in emacs 28.2 or I doing anything wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For one of the things I work on I use emacs exclusively in a terminal over an ssh session rather than through the GUI. I am developing C++ and recently switched from a ycmd setup to using eglot with a more recent clangd. And there's one thing it does that I want it to not do, but I can't identify the name of the behavior to google for how to configure it off (or if it's attributable to eglot or one of the other modes that eglot interacts with).
  
const auto sources: const std::set<SourceDetails> = get_filtered_sources(config, source_options);
  
The text I'm rendering here with strikethrough isn't struck through on my terminal, but it's rendered in a different text color and it's always displayed, but isn't part of the text of the buffer. When I declare a variable with auto it will annotate it with the type of the variable. Or when I call a function it will sometimes tag the names of the arguments like so:
  
config.get<std::string>(tag: "the_key_sought");
  
I would like it to not do this - these annotations unconditionally inserting itself into the flow of text pushes things out of alignment, makes rectangular yank more confusing, etc.
 Does anyone know the name of this behavior or (even better) how to configure my eglot+clangd setup to not do this? Having these annotations appear only on request would be ideal, but having them not appear at all (while not disabling eglot completely) would be a big improvement.

 I'm new to emacs, I switched over to it mostly because of org-mode. Most things are working perfectly, except for the icons in org-mode, and perhaps all icons? I'm not really sure since its the first time I use doom emacs. This is how my org files look:
 my current org-mode
 I checked for the all-the-icons font, and apparently it's installed corrently:

 And here's my doom doctor output:

 I did M-x doom/reload and doom sync, restarted emacs, and it still doesn't work. I've done M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts too. Does anybody know how to fix this?
 Here's my fetch if that helps in any way:

 For clarification, I want my org files to look like this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a literate configuration named "custom-init.org," which is loaded in the init.el file as follows:
 ;; Load the Emacs Lisp code blocks embedded in the literate Org file (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/custom-init.org")) 
 I've noticed that some people use a different loading strategy, where they directly load the Emacs Lisp file if it's available. However, this approach isn't any faster than using org-babel-load-file in my opinion:
 (if (file-exists-p (expand-file-name "config.el" user-emacs-directory)) (load-file (expand-file-name "config.el" user-emacs-directory)) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "custom-init.org" user-emacs-directory))) 
 org-babel-load-file only auto-tangles during startup when it detects a modification; otherwise, it loads the cached stuff.
 The fact that Emacs initially loads the init.el file and then needs to access a different file, regardless of the method used, is what introduces a speed penalty.
 I was thinking about giving up on the Org literate setup, but right now, I don't have much time to redo my Emacs configuration in plain Emacs Lisp. I know there are cool stuff like the outshine mode, etc.. However, I'm wondering if there might be another way. Maybe there's a way to have Org mode directly add everything tangled into the "init.el" file? That would make Emacs load much faster without the need of a server/client thing.
 Also, do you think Org really adds a layer of unnecessary abstraction for a literate config, to the point where I should think about giving up at some stage? I've been considering whether the effort is justified if it's working well.

 Fine and dandy, I did that for modes such as emacs-lisp-mode, lisp-interaction-mode and slime-repl-mode just fine, even those including cape-company-to-capf. Find one (working!) example below: ``` (defun or/cape-capfs-slime-repl-mode () (dolist (e (list #'cape-file (cape-company-to-capf #'company-slime))) (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions e)))
 (use-package cape :hook (slime-repl-mode . or/cape-capfs-slime-repl-mode))…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am wondering if it's possible to use Eglot with Emacs's built-in indentation and respect the language server's indentation everywhere. Of course I could use eglot-format to reindent the entire buffer upon save. But when editing the file, <tab> still uses the major mode's indentation settings.
 I'm writing C++ code and use a .clang-format to control the project code style, which Eglot uses through Clang. I tried to write a eglot-indent-line function and bind it to indent-line-function, as described here. But like the linked email said, simple things like (newline) doesn't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I am learning to use postgresql-simple by building a little website.
 Currently my functions to get data from the database live inside IO [a] where a is a type I am using to model my data.
  getPostById :: Connection -> Int -> IO [Post] getPostById conn x = query conn "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ?" (Only x) 
 I have read that if something bad happens, postgresql-simple throws exceptions such as "FormatError" if the format of the query is no valid SQL. link: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple-0.7.0.0/docs/Database-PostgreSQL-Simple.html#g:13
 What I would like is using IO (Either Text Post) as a return type (so when any exception is thrown, it will get returned as a Left err).
 Is this possible? Is this an antipattern? How else would I handle the exceptions..? I assumed in Haskell it is common to use Maybe or Either to model exceptions/errors and am somewhat surprised about exceptions here.
 Appreciate any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've run into a nice use case for some GADTs using GHC.TypeNats in a project, but I'm having trouble getting anything to typecheck. Specifically, I've isolated the following example:
 data Foo (n :: Nat) where FooZ :: Foo 0 FooS :: Foo n -> Foo (n+1) fooMax :: Foo n -> Foo m -> Foo (max n m) fooMax FooZ x = x fooMax x FooZ = x fooMax (FooS x) (FooS y) = FooS (fooMax x y) 
 (In my actual use case I have some data structure where n encodes a kind of depth, and I want a "merge" function which produces a structure whose depth is the maximum of the depths, but I think the above reproduces my issues quite well.)
 This fails to typecheck, since ghc doesn't infer that max n 0 ~ n, max 0 n ~ n, and max n1 n2 + 1 ~ max n m given n ~ n1+1 and m~n2+1. I've played with agda in the past, where the solution would be to pass along some kind of witnesses to these relations constructed via induction over the structure of Nat, but here I'm a bit stumped, since as far as I can tell GHC.TypeNats and the operations on them are not built via Peano axioms.
 Can anyone shed some light on how one would go about convincing GHC of the above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I played around with GADTs and realized that data constructor definitions look really confusing to me:
 data Term a where IntTerm :: Int -> Term Int BoolTerm :: Bool -> Term Bool SumTerm :: Term Int -> Term Int -> Term Int EqTerm :: (Show x) => Term x -> Term x -> Term Bool 
 The main reason is that they just look like function type definitions, I do not define their "implementation" anywhere. Yet they can be used at runtime and somehow construct values of the type Term a.
 Is it correct to say that a definition like
 EqTerm :: (Show x) => Term x -> Term x -> Term Bool 
 ultimately means something like "at runtime store a tuple of (ADT tag for EqTerm, x, x), call it EqTerm in pattern matching, and for type checking assume that this value has type Term Bool and that the contents implement Show"?
 And also, does using a GADT prevent some optimizations that could be possible for a regular ADT, like storing unboxed representation of contents?
 Thanks!

 I've created an init.el file with the following contents:
 (require 'org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "config.org" user-emacs-directory)) 
 And here's the content of the config.org file:
 * Configuration #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (menu-bar-mode -1) (tool-bar-mode -1) #+END_SRC 
 Both of these files are located in the ~/.config/emacs directory.
 However, the config.org file doesn't seem to be sourced in the init.el file, and I'm not quite sure why. I've watched a couple of YouTube videos and visited some websites, and I'm following the exact steps they're showing, but it's not working for me.
 Could you folks assist me in figuring out what I might be doing wrong here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing with Emacs 29's native tree-sitter for indentation and other ideas. First impression: it's really so very powerful compared to the bad old days of regexp matching and even ppss. It just understand the code. So far so good.
 That said, I've been trying to assess performance impact for applications that run frequently, e.g. via font-lock. Finding node at point is insanely fast: a fraction of a µs. But to my surprise, tree-sitter actions like "find all parent nodes starting from the current node" tend to vary in duration from (still very fast) 2–10µs to hundreds of µs or even several ms, depending on where the search starts from. I certainly expect some variability as you navigate from different depths within the syntax tree, but repeatable factors of 1000 seems a bit extreme, and make it hard to predict performance for latency-sensitive code.
 Does anyone have insight into this performance variability? Do you experience it as well? Perhaps it depends on the parser backend (I've tried only python so far)? Or is it fundamental to the TS algorithm?
 An example simple code to try, from various code locations in a large-ish file:
 (benchmark-run 100000 (let ((n (treesit-node-at (point) 'python))) ; or whichever language you have (while n (setq n (treesit-node-parent n))))) 
 Multiply the result by 10 and that is the number of µs each "navigate up from node" operation takes.

 I don't use midnight mode specifically but I do use clean-buffer-list since I found out about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a math grad student who has been looking for personal knowledge management solutions, and a while back I posted here on my use case. Many people recommended Org Roam, so I took the plunge and have been very happy with that decision. I've used roam to learn new things and better organize and consolidate what I do know, and the results have been excellent so far.
 I'm now trying to extend my system to handle problem sheets and exercises. When I'm working through a math book, I'd like to record of the exercises I solve.
 So for example, if I was working through Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry, I'd like to be able to create a node/org file "Solutions to Hartshorne.org" with the chapter titles as headlines and in each headline I'd have environments like:
 #+begin_problem
 Give an example of an irreducible polynomial f in R[x, y], whose zero set Z(f) is not irreducible.
 #+end_problem
 #+begin_solution
 BLAH BLAH
 #+end_solution
 What I'm hoping for is a good, lightweight LaTeX package or class defining such environments that I can include in the header or setup files so that I can export my org file to PDF and get a nice solution manual. I'd prefer to be able to easily customize the solution numbering to match that of different books i.e. alphabetical, roman, numbers etc. I'd also like to handle problems with multiple parts well. I'm not too worried about the other aspects of the formatting.
 I realize this may be more of a LaTeX question, but hopefully I can get some advice here on how to set up the kind of system I want. Any help or suggestions for a better setup would be very appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using successfully org-roam (from melpa stable) with Emacs 27 and 28, but since I installed version 29.1 on my Artix box I continue to get this error message
 ` (use-package): org-roam/:config: Selecting deleted buffer`
 I already tried to cancel the sqlite database, but no success. Any suggestion?
 ​
 EDIT
  
Removing elc files from org-roam didn't help
 tried to remove the sqlite database: no success
 upgrade packages didn't change anything
 tried different sqlite3 libraries doesn't work
  
[SOLVED]
 Ok, after some other attempts, I find a solution.
  
I changed the melpa repository to the melpa instead of melpa-stable;
 this allowed me to install emacsql-sqlite-builtin package
 I added the instructions  (use-package emacsql-sqlite-builtin) (setq org-roam-database-connector 'sqlite-builtin) 
  
Now org-roam works.
 Thank you all for your help: I hope this will be useful in the future

The M2 version is working flawlessly so far, but the Intel version is being very wonky. When performing various simple operations (such as scrolling) it very often completely blanks out the screen for a few seconds and then returns. What's worse, is that quite frequently, it gets in a state in which it won't respond to any key sequence (not even C-g), and needs to be force quit. They are both running the same init.el files and using the same packages, and both are running the latest version of Ventura. I never had any of these problems before upgrading to 29.1. Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago someone on discourse came with an interesting way of using (or abusing?) the block argument extension which allows this 
 example = fmap do \x → x^2 + 1 do [1, 2, 3] 
 to compile. Basically it allows to use do to replace $ or parenthesis. Beside the fact that it can be a good idea or not it makes me look at the BlockArgument doc.
 I've learn a few usefull stuff. 
  
The grammar is ambiguous regarding the extent of lambda abstractions, let expressions, and conditionals. The ambiguity is resolved by the meta-rule that each of these constructs extends as far to the right as possible.
  
The "as far to the right as possible" means that we don't need the second do.
 so
 example2 = fmap do \x -> x^2 + 1 [1, 2, 3] 
 shoud work and does !. Also 
  
They include do, lambda, if, case, and let expressions.
  
So we shouldn't need the first do because lambda does the same job.
 example3 = fmap \x -> x^2 + 1 [1, 2, 3] 
 But it doesn't compile.
 Neither does
 example4 = fmap \x -> x^2 + 1 do [1, 2, 3] 
 So my question why is that example2 works but example3 and exapmle4 don't ? Is it a bug or am I misunderstanding the doc ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realized today that the most general callCC type is the following:
 newtype Cont r a = Cont {runCont :: (a -> r) -> r} callCC :: ((forall b. a -> Cont r b) -> Cont r a) -> Cont r a callCC f = Cont \k -> runCont (f \a -> Cont \_ -> k a) k 
 The "exit" argument never returns, so it should have arbitrary return type, like any other Haskell function that never returns. Equivalently, it could return Cont r Void. 
 After a quick search I found that the above type was already suggested in 1991. What's the reason behind the current callCC type in Haskell? Is it just because of the lack of RankNTypes or Void support from when it was introduced? Or maybe the more general type is problematic in MonadCont for some reason?

 It would allow you not only to format your statements, but go to the end of a line C-j would send the statement and show you results in a seperate buffer. Really nice for constructing sql statements.
 I can't find that mode, can someone help?

 The Haskell GTK4 binding seem to be maintained (https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi), however there is not much activity and no documentation at all – all the documentation is about GTK3. The only GTK4 app I could find was ghcup-gtk a project in a very early stage.
 So I wanted to ask you if you think that there is any sense in trying to build a GTK4 app in Haskell or should I just move on and learn Rust? I’m still learning Haskell and never did any bigger project with it, but after I’ve seen the delightful world of pure functional programming the imagination of writing imperative code kind of depresses me, you know what I mean?
 Do you know any GTK4/Haskell apps? Have you ever tried to build one? What do you think?

 I've been reading a bit about the new primops for delimited continuations that enable for efficient algebra effects but I don't have a strong understanding of them yet.
 I was wondering if it would be possible to implement something more like the usual callCC using them to capture the current continuation in the IO monad? I'm imagining a function with a type callCC :: ((a -> IO b) -> IO b) -> IO b (modulo some prompt tags) but this seems quite far removed from the provided control0 :: PromptTag a -> ((IO b -> IO a) -> IO a) -> IO b primitive.

 in the last days I took some time to customize my completion setup using vertico, orderless, corfu and cape using the respective github repo's information. Most of this has worked out just fine and I am a lot closer to a comfy and satifsying setup than I ever have been.
 However, there is one thing I simply don't understand, and it relates to the Cape package. The example use-package-declaration features both :bind forms as well as (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-\*) forms.
 So far, I've understood it as :bind forms are there to invoke a specific CAPF while add-to-list forms are there to populate something like a pool from which completion-at-point can choose an according backend when prompted.
 However, there is two things that don't conform with this inte…]]></summary>

 A year ago I tried Elixir and I really liked it. It was simple, immutable, and has no special syntax for side effects. This made it very approachable and I really liked it. When I was trying to learn Haskell I struggled to understand the concept of a Monad. I understand that concepts like Maybe(Haskell) and Result(Rust) are monads but I used them only as Higher Kinded types and had a very intuitive(as opposed to formal) understanding of what they do. I think of them mostly as tags added to a primitive type. Like type Email = Email String (as a quick example), where we say that an Email is a special type of string.

 I'm the author of plainorg.com and have had a fair number of users requesting agenda capabilities (scheduling, custom filters, multi-file support, different kinds of views, syncing, the list goes on). The thing is, building great and polished experiences like these for org on iOS (and anywhere) does require non-trivial effort with lots of iterations to get to that great experience.
 How would you realistically kickstart it and fund it (adverts are not an option)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have recently started using OpenAI-based MacWhisper to dictate notes. Perhaps many of you have used dictation for your notes, but I find that Whisper has extremely high quality and gets things like punctuation, hyphenation, capitalization and so forth correct even with my strongly Indian accent. One of the benefits I have seen from doing this is that my notes have become somewhat more conversational than before. I find this to be a benefit rather than something bad, because it seems to be capturing what I am thinking now somewhat better. Perhaps this conversational tone of the note might be more relatable a few years down the line, but that is just a guess.
All the whisper models of all sizes are free but Macwhisper provides a free way of accessing these for the three smallest models. If you want to use the larger models you have to pay a one-time fee of $20 to make that possible. Perhaps other free tools even with the large models will become available soon. In terms of privacy, one of the good things here is that the model is sitting on your computer so the data never leaves the computer and it seems safe even for private notes for that reason.]]></summary>

 In short, I am trying to achieve a kind of filter and then map effect on Either type based on my parsing result in a same function. This helps me avoid using partial function or duplication of pattern matching for sum types. Example:
 identifierTokenParser :: TokenParser (String, Int, Int) identifierTokenParser = first toParseError $ symMaybeMap getVal where getVal Info {val = Identifier str, startRow = row, startCol = col} = Just (str, row, col) getVal _ = Nothing 
 If here I have used symIf and then fmap kind of thing then there should have been another pattern matching that was fully redundant.
 Just to give context I am pattern matching on programming language tokens:
 data Token = Illegal | Identifier String | Integer String | StringVal String | -- Symbols Comma | Semicolon .... 
 I became curious if it is some standard technique we use and is there any mathematical structure hidden behind this?
 I am quite new to haskell so not sure of Haskell standard patterns.

Is there a way to make it recognize and process the awesome libraries?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am working on a project and I need to write a backend in Scala. I was thinking of using Scalatra but I read some posts and received some feedback indicating that Scala devs prefer a different stack. I remember encountering something like this in the Rust community where backends written in Rust often don't use ORMs ( but there are ORMs available).
 Despite my best efforts, I keep finding new frameworks mentioned here in Reddit that I couldn't find searching on my own. I've also noticed that a lot of articles about Scala are kind of old. How do you keep up with new libraries/frameworks? So I want to reach out to the community and ask: what kind of stack would you use as a backend?
 I am familiar with Postgresql, but it might be the case that in the Scala community there is a special DB framework (like Datomic is for Clojure). I like Functional Programming but I don't want to use monads. I settle with a simple flavor of FP(like Elixir). I've read that effects are easier to use over monads and that Scala has support for effects but I am unfamiliar with the subject. Is it the standard library or is it an external library.
 Thank you for your time

 TL;DR Questions
  
How do I prevent an update from bringing back these unused variables if I fix it? Do I have to fork it? Is there a way to fork it and allow updates to still offer themselves to me so I can use a diff/patch sort of thing? 
 
Why do you think the author included those variables if they're unused? Did they just forget? If you can help me figure out what they were intending to do, I'd like to put the variables to use or just delete the lines with the variable declarations.
 
 Background
 I just started playing with emacs, but I downloaded some evil mode packages because I mainly use vim. To that end, I installed evil-tex. It gave me a bunch of docstring wider than 80 characters warnings, so I did M-x find-library RET evil-tex and broke up all docstrings …]]></summary>

 Has anyone else noticed this? ... when moving the cursor up or down (without changing the column) sometimes (not always) doom-modeline fails to update the line number. Doesn't matter how long I wait, it doesn't update.
 If I turn off doom-modeline, it all works again (just not so pretty).
 It's not one of the laggy issues documented on the doom-modeline github page as the line number is never updated (ie not just slow). Also, I tried those fixes and it's happening on local files, not tramp.
 When the column is updated (left or right movement) both line numbers and column numbers are both updated correctly.

 It sounds like you can also customize a lot using just use-package. I was thinking of putting all settings related to a package in its use-package declaration, then using customize for emacs built-in options and faces. Then maybe I could use elisp for hooks, functions, and more complicated customizations.

 Say I add a new keybinding to my *keybindings.el* in the 'settings' directory:
 ;; new binding (global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'org-agenda) (use-package which-key :init (which-key-mode) :diminish which-key-mode :config (setq which-key-idle-delay 2)) (provide 'key-bindings) 
 And in my *init.el* file I have this:
 (setq settings-dir (expand-file-name "settings" user-emacs-directory)) (add-to-list 'load-path settings-dir) 
 Having added the keybinding and run *eval-buffer* inside the *keybindings.el* buffer, I can use the binding right away. If I however remove it from *keybindings.el* and eval-buffer again, it persist.
 What gives here? It seems that generally removing bindings isn't able to be affected by evaluation since I'm able to change the keybinding illustrated above from "C-c a" to "C-c p" and the new binding works, but the old binding appears to still be bound to the function.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to create links to inline latex equation in org mode in a way that makes the referenced equation obvious just from looking at it, without actually following the link.
 Let me clarify this a bit. When I write a latex file, I can create an equation with a label "myeq". Then when I compile the document, the equation is going to appear with a number next to it, and if I reference "myeq" in the text, the reference is going to turn into hyperlink with the number of the equation.
 In contrast, the closest thing I can do in org mode, is adding a #+NAME property to the equation, and referencing it with a standard org-mode link. This translates nicely to latex links if I export it to latex, however, it is sort-of inconvenient if I look at the file in org-mode because the #NAME property disappears when I compile the latex fragments, so I can't tell which equation a given link is pointing to without following it.
 Any ideas how to solve this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using ido-mode for many years now.
 Fido-mode seems like it might be more supported these days, especially since it also seems to apply to completing reads out-of-the-box, whereas I have horrible hacks in my init.el to use ido-mode too that way. And it seems to be a bit better about showing hints or supporting information than ido-mode. (E.g., showing me the character too and not just the unicode name when I tab-complete in C-x 8 RET.)
 But I can't find an equivalent for how ido-mode will cache files and directories that I find things in (and save this in ~/.ido.last), and then, if I C-x C-f and start typing a file name that isn't in the current directory but is in a cached file or directory, it will show the message "Searching for foo..." and then jump right to offering it after a brief pause (the ido-auto-merge-delay-time, I believe).
 Is there an equivalent to this for fido-mode? I looked at recentf-mode, but it seems like it's separate functionality that must be manually invoked, rather than being able to integrate into fido-mode and provide smart filename completion support automatically.
 Am I missing something? Or should I just continue to stay on ido-mode? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One can open an android APK as a project in Android Studio. If the APK has been installed on a mobile that has developer options enabled, it is then possible to get a log of what happens during the apps start up.
 Install the app on the mobile, ensure that the developer options are enabled. In developer options enable USB debugging. Connect the computer to the mobile with a USB cable. At first connection you will have to authorize (on the mobile) access from the computer. In developer options go to "Select debug app" and choose, say "org.gnu.emacs". Also enable "Wait for debugger".
 See the following web page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16929391/android-how-to-debug-apps-start-up-process
 Check that you can access the mobile from the computer by running from the command line e.g.:
 - adb -d shell
 ls
 Now open the APK as a project in Android Studio, if you have not already done this. In the device manager (View > Tool Windows > Device Manager), select you mobile under "Physical".
 Start emacs on the mobile. You should get a requester "Waiting for debugger". In Android Studio select Run > Attach to Process. This should open a debug console, but this window will probably only show that Android Studio connects to the app, but then loses the connection (because the app crashes).
 All is not lost: In the debug window select "Logcat" at the bottom. This will probably also not show a lot, but notice at the top of the window the text "package:myapp" or some such. Change this to "package:org.gnu.emacs", and you should now hopefully see a crash log.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is how I succeeded in building Android emacs with the libpng library. The process is described in the emacs repo file ./java/INSTALL, but here are some additional details. My initial build of emacs with this library crashed at start up. I will describe in a separate post how I debugged this.
 I browsed to https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libpng and made a git clone of the repo. I then used magit to select branch android13-release. There was no Android.mk file in that branch, so I looked for it in older release branches. The newest release branch that had an Android.mk was nougat-release, so I copied that file outside the repo, went back to branch android13-release and moved Android.mk into the repo directory.
 I compared the file to Android.bp but saw essentially nothing that was needed to change. I set LOCAL_SDK_VERSION := 25, but am unsure if that variable has any significance. I eventually compared Android.mk to CMakeLists.txt, and discovered that I had missed a file needed in my_src_files_arm: arm/palette_neon_intrinsics.c
 Building without that extra source file caused no complaint from the build, but emacs crashed at start up.
 To build with the libpng library I added the following option to configure:
 --with-ndk-path=$HOME/projects/android/libpng
 After the build it is a good idea to check that the expected library files are actually in the build directory:
 ls cross/ndk-build

 The defface is really finicky, you must have '((' for it to work.

 Is there a more convenient way to see the effective (local and global at once, maybe even combined) value for the current buffer?

 Also, if a variable is not specific to a buffer (buffer local), will using setopt set its value globally, similar to how setq-default works? I mean setopt knows when to use setq vs. setq-default behind the scenes?

I wanted to give Emacs 29 a try (the nixpkgs update seems imminent as of writing though), but I couldn't make the emacs-overlay to work out for me. I'm pretty sure I'm doing something silly and incorrect -- but with Homebrew with emacs-mac, I can use `--with-mac-metal` and other flags such as `--with-no-title-bars`, which I don't see how I can do that with Nix setup. I'm fairly new to Nix and very possible I'm not seeing something obvious.
 I'd like to hear opinions on how people install Emacs on macOS -- do you use Homebrew for apps including Emacs even if you use Nix, or do you stick to Emacs on Nix? What are some of extra flags I should be aware of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow emacs users :)
 Long time basic user here.
 I like to play online radios while I work on emacs. Have this bit of code to play them on emacs:
 ``` (defcustom emms-radio-channels '() "User defined online radio channels." :type '(repeat (cons (string :tag "Name") (string :tag "URL"))) :group 'emms)
 (defun emms-play-radio () "Show candidates from `emms-radio-channels' on a completion buffer. Play the selection using EMMS." (interactive) (let ((channel (completing-read "Channel: " (mapcar #'car emms-radio-channels) nil nil))) (emms-play-url (or (cdr (assoc channel emms-radio-channels)) channel))))
 ```
 Then, I'm using use-package to load my module and customize the list of channels (short example)
  (use-package multimedia :ensure nil :custom (emms-radio-channels '(("openFM - smooth jazz" . "https://stream.open.fm/60") ("jazz radio funk" . "https://jazz-wr06.ice.infomaniak.ch/jazz-wr06-128.mp3") ("bbc radio3" . "https://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_three") ("swingFM" . "https://swingfm.ice.infomaniak.ch/swingfm-128.mp3") ("radioSky - jazz" . "http://listen.radioskymusic.com:7006/live") ("soundtrack radio station" . "http://streamingp.shoutcast.com/JamendoLounge")))) 
 It works great but my list is way longer than that and it is a bit of a pain to add new streams to it.
 I'm wonder if there's a way to convert standalone org links to a list like the above. I'm fairly sure there's a way but I'm a newbie to org mode besides basic outline and babel functions.
 Thanks for your input!

 emacs/init.el:

 But I want to add nested directories like this:
 emacs ├── init.el ├── core │ ├── autosave.el │ ├── backups.el │ └── init.el ├── modes │ ├── evil-mode.el │ ├── init.el │ └── org-mode.el └── ui ├── init.el ├── modeline.el ├── reset.el └── themes.el 
 emacs/init.el:
 (require 'core) (require 'modes) (require 'ui) 
 emacs/core/init.el:
 (require 'autosave) (require 'backups) (provide 'core) 
 emacs/modes/init.el
 (require 'evil-mode) (require 'org-mode) (provide 'modes) 
 Is there any way to split my init.el into multiple files *and* directories?

 I've thought of just making a private GitHub repository for it, but I'm a little apprehensive about doing that as I wouldn't be surprised if my notes somehow make their way into training data for large language models.
 What are some solutions that you folks use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, going to be honest, I set these configs a long time ago and I've just been using the same configs for years now. I have the following in my ~/.emacs file:
 (setq package-list '(auto-complete restclient go-mode exec-path-from-shell)) (require 'package) (setq package-archives '(("elpa" . "http://tromey.com/elpa/") ("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/") ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/")) (package-initialize) (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents)) (dolist (package package-list) (unless (package-installed-p package) (package-install package))) 
 I've redacted some lines, but I tried to show what I feel like is relevant to my problem.
 I do not have auto-complete installed and every time I attempt to install it, I get a "Not Found" response.
 The following is an example of my ~/.emacs.d directory:
 .emacs.d/ auto-save-list/ elpa/ archives/ elpa/ archive-contents/ gnu/ archive-contents/ 
 I don't see any files (visible and hidden) or additional directories within any of the directories mentioned above.
 Does anyone possibly know the issue I'm running into?
 ​
 Edit:Just want to add that I've also tried the following in place of using setq:
 (add-to-list 'package-archives '("elpa" . "http://tromey.com/elpa/")) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So basically, I want to export my notes which have relative images attached to them, which works really well when I am using it with just org mode. But now I have to export the notes to pdf to share it with the instructor. So I basically want the images to be explicitly embedded in the pdf file, and not a hyperlink pointing to the image.I am getting the desired results by removing the metadata while linking the image in the org file, like just doing [[./filename.png]]. I wanted to know whether there was some way to make this emacs' default behavior?
 I use pandoc to convert org to pdf directly. Pandoc uses pdflatex on the backend.
 Thanks for your time.

When I initiate org-capture, I select a predefined template, and then the screen splits horizontally. The lower half of the screen is where I input the content I'm capturing. I'm wondering if it wouldn't be more convenient to have the capturing process take up the entire window instead of being split. Is there any specific purpose for the upper area during the capturing process?
 I'm curious if there's a customizable variable for this, and I would greatly appreciate your suggestions on the matter.

 However, problem arises when one is too used to those bindings. How many closed tabs in Firefox, oh boy.
 But we are on Emacs, there's a solution for everything, some less practical than others:
  
Remapping C-x and C-c maps is quite a chore, since AFAIK many features are hard coded to those prefixes.
 
CUA mode is also not preferable since C-c and C-c are highly used prefixes
 
Having cut/copy/paste globally bound to different common keys could be an option, however binding settings are relative to specific application or graphical toolkit
 
 What are your experiences in this regard?

I also have yapfify-mode installed in Emacs and if I do yapfify-region it works as it should.
 When I check the Eglot events buffer I can see a client request for rangeFormatting but the server reply with a result nil, it seems python-lsp-server does not pickup yapf to do formatting.
 Do I need to do additional configuration in Emacs to get python-lsp-server to use yapf and perform code formatting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tldr: I think Emacs 29 is slower than 28 so I downgraded it. 
 Longer version: I have 2 Apple laptops, one super new, the other super old. I ran either 29 or 30 on them in the past months. In the last couple of weeks I focused on the 29 branch, running the pretests and as of last week, installed the official 29.1.
 I guess I began to see slowness or lagging, since I explicitly began a bankruptcy on the older laptop - initially thinking I have too much packages. Everything was lagging: browsing org files, startup times, describe-variable took couple of seconds to return results, M-x completion with vertico had a noticeable lag with each key press, key press latency in writing, eglot jumping to definitions. So much so that I really started thinking about replacing my old laptop.
 Yesterday I decided that I want to test whether it's due to Emacs. I reverted back to 28.2 on both laptops. It was night and day. The new laptop flies; the old laptop runs smoothly so I even reverted the bankruptcy, adding back all the packages I removed and it's still as smooth as I remember Emacs running in the past. 
 This is not a bug report. It's my own observation, running multiple versions of Emacs on old and new hardware, sometimes compiling from source, sometimes downloading from https://emacsforosx.com/. I just want to raise awareness, see if people have a similar experience. If enough evidence arises, perhaps someone who knows what they're doing can run benchmarks or profiling and we'll go from there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As i'm getting my Emacs config closer and closer to where i want, it inevitably starts "behaving weird". This is something i've struggled with again and again, and it has, once or twice, lead me away from emacs. But now i want to understand this:
 What is the proper order to configure and load stuff in my config, so that everything works correctly?
 Currently i'm facing an issue with standard-themes. Normally, themes are what i put below "emacs internal configs" but at the top of my "external packages". But the standard-themes-light theme doesn't load correctly. Centaur tabs are dark, org-mode code blocks aren't proplerly backgrounded. If i switch themes after starting emacs, and switch back to standard-light, everything is fine. I tried loading the theme as the last thing in my init.el, but that didn't change the behavior.
 This is only one issue currently. I've had others in the past.
 Since i'm pretty new to writing my emacs config from scratch, could some of the "veterans" explain what i should be putting where? Does splitting the config into a few files help? What's the "best practice" here?

 Cats-effect is marketed as a "pure asynchronous runtime" while ZIO provides "type-safe, composable asynchronous and concurrent programming".
 Both of these put quite the emphasis on "asynchronous" and "concurrent", which makes me wonder: 
 Say I want to do what I do now, the basic HTTP crud stuff, but with Scala, is it overkill to go for http4s or zio-http?

 I though I had set the command key to not get passed to the os but that doesn't seem to fix the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking for a good language to implement a personal project I have (a search engine). After listening to Martin Odersky's talk "Simply Scala" at ScalaIO Parris 2022, I decided to give Scala a try. I practiced some Scala 3 and everything worked great. So far I really like the language. I am at the stage of selecting the libraries that I will use for the project. I wanted to implement the backend in Scala but after I stumbled with the Lift framework and after reading other posts on Full Stack Scala, I really want to give it a try. Specially since my UI is going to be simple. I was thinking of using Scalatra for the backend and maybe Lift in the front end (if the UI gets complex enough). But I noticed that both frameworks only have stable versions that are compatible with Scala 2. This article (https://medium.com/@takezoe/scalatra-now-supports-scala3-4eb8988484a7) claims that Scalatra supports Scala 3. It makes sense, since (as I understand) Scala 3 is binary compatible with Scala 2. But the Scalatra docs only covers the Scala 2 version. There are no docs for the Scala 3 version. Is this because there is no meaningful difference between the APIs of the two versions? I also read a post that mentioned that Akka did not fully support Scala 3( I tried finding it again to link it here but I couldn't find it). This gives me the impresion that Scala 3 is still not supported by most libraries.
 I have not tried to run any test projects because I still need to learn how to use sbt (I started learning Scala a couple of days ago). But I got cold feet. Before I proceed, in order to spare myself unnecessary hurdles, I would like some advice. Should I learn Scala 2 and wait until the ecosystem migrates to Scala 3? Or is it recommended to stick to Scala 3 and work around the few incompatibilities that some frameworks might have?

 I'd like to know good resources and opinionated usage examples. 
 Moreover, I'd like to know if org-ql is meant to be an extension or a replacement of org's standard filter predicates. Org agenda's built in filter predicates look quite cumbersome and I'd like to know if it would be possible to configure org agenda by just using org-ql languages or if I'm gonna need to use it anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given following function with 3 parameters:
 def foo(a: A, b: B, c: C): D = ??? 
 If we know that a changes rarely, we can kind of curry it using OOP:
 class Foo(private val a: A): def foo(b: B, c: C): D = ??? 
 Now, what are reasons to change, say, c to implicit like this:
 class Foo(private val a: A): def foo(b: B)(using c: C): D = ??? 
 My thoughts so far:
  
Capability. Like CanThrow or DbTransaction - indicating function requires special scope for evaluation - e.g. scope catching specific exceptions or scope running database transaction, committing or aborting it in the end.
 Mutable data - to keep our class Foo immutable, we can pass so-called Context containing mutable stuff - caches for example.
 Stateful objects with lifecycle - if C has close() method, we have following options: a) pass c via Foo's constructor and add close() to Foo, making it mutable b) pass c as ordinary parameter which clutters client code without much benefit c) use context function that provides implicit C in scope and closes C when it leaves the scope.
  
I'm calling out for other people's experience - which of those are good ideas? Which are not-so-good ideas? May be there are other considerations?
 This is about dependency management, I would like to leave other uses of implicit parameters out of scope of this discussion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back when I started using Emacs a few years ago, I went all out and added tons of stuff to my setup. But as time passed, I realized I hardly use most of those packages. Nowadays, I'm keeping it minimal and sticking mainly to Org mode.
 I'm thinking of setting up a capture template for my journaling, kind of like this:
 "j" "Journal entry" entry (file+olp+datetree "~/orgfiles/journal.org") "** %^{Heading}") 
 The downside of this approach is that everything will end up in a single file, which might grow over time and become challenging to manage. However, I can archive all the journal entries at the end of the year and starting fresh annually to counter this.
 I've been thinking about whether it's worthwhile to use a separate package, since org-journal appears to generate a similar date tree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I'm having trouble logging in to a remote computer when setting csh as a default shell. I've turned on tramp-debug to 6 and the issue seems to be that Emacs sends the following hardcoded command in tramp-sh.el  "exec env TERM='%s' INSIDE_EMACS='%s' " "ENV=%s %s PROMPT_COMMAND='' PS1=%s PS2='' PS3='' %s %s -i") 
 With the expectation that the shell output is controlled by the variables PS1, PS2, PS3 etc.
 However, from the man pages of csh, the prompt output is controlled by prompt, prompt2 and prompt3. Does emacs tramp have a way to address this? 
 I'm running GNU Emacs 28.2 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2022-09-13 from windows. Again the issues seems that the csh that I'm trying to set as remote does not use PS1, PS2, PS3 and emacs has it hardcoded.

 However, in the case of \chapter* I want to pass the section title to the exporter twice, once as a required argument and once as an optional argument. (I.e. \chapter*[title]{title}.) This is because the optional argument is necessary for memoir to put the chapter title in the running header.
 If I try \\chapter*[%s]{%s} it of course fails with org-export-data: Not enough arguments for format string. Is there a straightforward way to achieve what I want? Has anyone found another way to get running chapter headings working with memoir?

 Somewhere in inbox.org is at least one character that makes "file" think that it's not a text file.
 In GNU Emacs 27.1, both files are shown as "utf-8-unix" in my modeline.
 So the issue with this wrong classification is not within Emacs but within some shell foo I'm doing outside of Emacs.
 Except the obvious bisect-remove-until-found-method: is there a clever (Emacs-)way to locate the character(s) that cause this?

 This is an early product, basically a prototype we have been running with a key customer (soon two) but we have really strong interest and now need to start upping the pace of delivery.
 The current team has some great support from an experienced Haskeller, but only part-time, which has allowed them to get this far but we now need a full-time contractor to come on board and accelerate the project.
 If you have experience shipping actual products built in Haskell, especially in startups (or, at least, early in the project's lifecycle), then please drop me a line (here or by email: gideon@converge.io). I would prefer freelance contractors to big consultancies. We are UK-based, additionally, which means we would prefer someone on UK+-2h timezone (but for the right person we can be flexible).

And as I get ready to explore some of the new features, I'm looking at my configuration with a wary eye; I've been using emacs (GNU, then XEmacs, then back to GNU) since my sophomore year of college (1987!), and my config shows it. Bloated, spaghetti-like, split among 15-16 files, etc.
 So, I'm deciding to take the "configuration bankruptcy" plunge and try to (mostly) restart from scratch. Yank almost everything out and start adding things back as I actually need them, not just because they look cool (and generally never get used).
 Those of you who've done this: any advice? I keep my config in GitHub, so for now I'm just creating a new branch to experiment on. I'm mostly concerned with not losing my history and desktop-mode settings.
 Edit: Just to clarify, despite the longevity I'm not really a "power user". So there are a lot of features that I don't come close to making the most of (Magit, etc.). My hope is that by cleaning this up and tightening things a little, I can grow into some new features.

 ​
 A couple of questions
 I seem to remember being able to hotkey from error to error on the output of the compilation at one time rather than using up-downs... how to you do this?
 Every time I compile I end up with yet another pane, I would like to fix the panes to left half full height edit and the make results on the right in a split plane. I know how to split panes but as I am compiling on the left I would like to have the results end up on the right pane... not overtake the left pane.
 Any other suggestions would be great.
 Kind regards for your help.

When I use emacs -nw while ssh'd from one Mac into another, everything works fine until I switch to another app on the local machine. At first I thought it was Cmd-Tab that was doing it, so I tried just clicking other apps, but the problem remains.
 It appears that any clicks I do in other apps are somehow registering inside of emacs in the terminal. Specifically, when I switch to another app, the emacs buffer also switches to another one. And usually when I click on something in another app (even the preferences app for Terminal itself), the Terminal will randomly insert I and O in whatever buffer is selected.
 Running Emacs 29.1, installed via homebrew. And I've had this issue on an older mac running Big Sur as well as a newer mac running a more recent OS, both ssh-ing into an M1 MacBook pro with all my files on it. 
 Ideas?

 This mode gives the ability to execute just recipes from within the editor itself.

 Instructions for how to build Android emacs are in the emacs repo, in file java/INSTALL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 ​
 I am writing a book and have over 250 plaintext files on the computer (all mailed from an app on the phone), about 20 are in org-mode.
 --- The mess ---
 - Snippets are unorganised in every way (made as I come up with them, jumping all over the place in the book-to-be, etc)
 - Each note contains multiple snippets, each of the snippets is divided by a marker.
 - Each snippet's size can be a single line or multiple paragraphs.
 Each of the notes is named note<number>-<date-of-storage>.txt
 --- The draft 0 ---
 Now I'm compiling the book's draft zero out of the snippets, choosing some snippets, rejecting others from the same note.
 It's daunting to see what I've left to do and what not, while not having much of an overview of the whole thing.
 ​
 Current workflow:
 - Placing 'ACCEPTED--' in front of a snippet/org-header
 - Going over one file after another, when one is completely done with, put it folder 'done'
 - Also, when snippets are big, I make the whole note into an org file, and can have some overview.
 ​
 --- The question ---
 I'm thinking of putting each snippet in their own file (via UNIX 'sed' command) and have org-roam take care of the administration of the status (unread/accepted/rejected/need2ndview/need3rdview).
 Is this use-case something org-roam is capable of/handy for, and if not, what (package) would be advisable?
 ​
 TIA

 I know Emacs on Windows is always slow. But with 29.1, it seems much slower. Interestingly, I feel it is only slow at start-up or when you first use some function in a session. Once it is started or you have triggered the function, everything runs smoothly.
 Any idea why?

Have you ever faced compatibility issues when dealing with Linux
binary executables? The culprit is often the libc implementation,
glibc. Acting as the backbone of nearly all Linux distros,
glibc is the library responsible for providing standard C functions. Yet, its
version compatibility often poses a challenge. Binaries compiled with
a newer version of glibc may not function on systems running an older
one, creating a compatibility headache.
So, how can we circumvent this issue?
The approach we’ll focus on today involves the creation of static executables. These
executables are self-contained and do not dynamically load libc,
thereby offering enhanced portability.
However, we’re not out of the woods yet. Glibc is
not well-suited for static linking becaus…]]></summary>

 I've also been told by many around the web that it's better to start with another programming language then go to Haskell, is that true?
 And yes, I have read the sidebar, LYAH doesn't have exercise so that's a pass, Real World Haskell has barely no exercises while being quite long and seems quite advance which is also a pass from me, School of Haskell is too short, while suffering from a mixture of the last two. 
 The only three promising resources(for my learning style, which is text-based w/ exercises) Haskell from the Very Beginning by Whitington, the Haskell Wikibooks and Learn Haskell by Building a Blog Generator by Gilmi.
 Any advice regarding those resources is appreciated.

 Background, I failed to set it up properly a couple of times. Once I set it up, then I experienced buggy behavior (like losing connection with the debug server when stepping through the code). Today, I decided to check out its latest state and hit another bug.
 This is the only config I made for python and I am on Doom Emacs
 (require 'dap-python) (setq dap-python-debugger 'debugpy) 
 and install the server in my environment
 pip install debugpy 
 I will give it another go for this week to see if it is stable.
 EDIT: Another issue (related to doom) I just came across is company completion in dap-ui-repl doesn't work. Maybe doom is the problem :/

 as an example of what i tried:
 ```haskell import System.IO (stdin, hReady, hSetBuffering, hSetEcho, BufferMode(NoBuffering)) import Control.Monad (when)
 main :: IO () main = do hSetBuffering stdin NoBuffering hSetEcho stdin False loop
 loop :: IO () loop = do key <- getKey when (key /= "") (putStrLn key) loop
 getKey :: IO [Char] getKey = reverse <$> getKey' ""
 getKey' :: [Char] -> IO [Char] getKey' xs = do ready <- hReady stdin if ready then do x <- getChar getKey' (x : xs) else return xs

 +--------------+---------------+ | | | | | | | | | | | | | window1 | window2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | +--------------+---------------+ | | | terminal | | | +------------------------------+ 
 When I try to open magit-status buffer with window1 or window2 active, it splits the terminal window horizontally to display it.
 How can I prevent this to happen? I want it the magit-status buffer to open in the bigger windows. If window is active, it would open in window2, and vice versa.
 I tried to use a different magit-display-buffer-function but it seems there isn't one to do that. The closest one I found would open the magit buffer over the current active buffer.
 I also tried to use winner-mode, so I could hide the terminal window before using magit-status by using winner-undo, but since I move between many windows, using the undo got confusing. Maybe there's a way to quickly toggle a window in the frame?

 My rough first draft is actually working, but the trouble is, running the AppleScript that collects the window list is very slow. It completes immediately outside of Emacs and in an Emacs shell. However, when I run it with call-process-shell-command, shell-command-to-string, or from a process started with make-process, it takes 2-5 seconds. 
 What’s happening? How can I improve the performance?

 Listing files with ls and eshell/ls shows the total and with "emacs -q" the behavior is the same, so I know it's not a package issue. I can't find anything in the NEWS file that justifies this change in behavior.

I'm bound to make some mistakes but would like to start off on the right foot if there's some best practices out there that folks find helpful.
 Thanks!

You can even add a bookmark to you browser so that when you click it, the bibliography information of the webpage you're visiting would be saved in some bib file. You can also get the links for attachments and download them from Emacs.
 This is done using Zotero translators, so it basically has the full power of Zotero. There is no need for the Zotero client, but it needs to connect to either Zotero translation server or zotra-cli as the backend.

 As far as I understand it, the tree-sitter layer is using the external package, which has some disadvantages. What is the right way to transition from the external package to the native one? Disabling the layer seems to have other implications and the transition is not natural (for example, I don't see my python-mode hooks apply to python-ts-mode). 
 I know this is a bit general, but perhaps someone has experience making the transition specifically with spacemacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I’m an Emacs newbie. I’m on macOS (Emacs 29.1 with native comp and pixel scroll). I want to use Emacs for managing a lot of my Markdown notes in a specific folder, and also implements Org-Mode. I have thousands of notes in my folder. Coming from Obsidian, there was a very nice extension called Omnisearch that would index the content of my notes and allows me to search them easily (title and content). In Emacs, I think that rg.el (frontend for ripgrep) could allow me to easily search through my notes. I heard about org-roam and some built-in search but I’m not interested in this package. I will start with mardown-mode and org-mode, and may try Denote in the future.
 My pain points and questions are the following:
 ​
  
Do you know which package could best match the search features of Omnisearch? As a beginner I’m a bit lost with the sheer amount of packages to do search (helm-rg, helm-ag, helm-org-riffle, deft, rg.el, counsel…). I settled on rg.el but I am not sure.
 When I open Emacs, it always start at the directory ~/. If I only want to manage the files in the notes directory, how should I go about that? Should I always use Dired to go to the directory and then exit? Or should I create a project (project.el ) for the directory containing all my notes? I see that a lot of package have features to interact with projects. I am a bit unclear about when to create a project or not.
 I installed Helm because it is always mentioned (I prefer a single package to do the thing rather that the popular alternative that is a combination of a lot of small packages), but should I even use Helm at all if I want to use Emacs to write, edit and search notes? I’m a bit unclear about the real value for me (I’m probably not advanced enough).
  
Thanks for your help!

 class F a b where f :: a -> b class MapT a b where mapT :: a -> b instance Num a => F a a where f = (+1) instance MapT () () where mapT () = () instance (F a b, MapT as bs) => MapT (a, as) (b, bs) where mapT (a, as) = (f a, mapT as) test :: (Int, (Double, (Float, ()))) test = mapT (1::Int, (2::Double, (3::Float, ()))) 
 I think the elements have to be a member of a typeclass (in this case Num) for this to work, and I don't think you can use the same MapT typeclass on different typeclasses of elements, but is there a way to use different functions of the same typeclass elements?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! This is something I've been using on and off for a while. And now that eww got an upgrade (being able to watch videos!) I got reminded of it. 
 It essentially tries to mimic Vimium, a vim navigation like extension in browsers. 
 Anyway, the code is not the greatest, there will be bugs, etc, its a WIP.
 As of now, it requires Avy, shr, and shrface. Let me know what you think, I will try to spend some time on it if it gets traction but I am also re-viving my youtube channel with videos on Emacs(already have a few scheduled!), so time is limited :)

 I am installing MSYS's Emacs 28.2 on my new work laptop.
 I could not get Spacemacs devel branch to load. The error message is an invalid Win32 file.
 Native elisp load failed: c:/Users/xyz/.emacs.d/eln-cache/28.2-10075233/subr--trampoline-6b696c6c2d656d616373_kill_emacs_0.eln, %1 is not a valid Win32 application.
 When I looked into the eln cache directory, several eln files had zero bytes. Those are the ones that were tripping up the loading of Spacemacs.
 I deleted the files, and restarted Spacemacs, but got the same message again, and the same zero-byte files were recreated.
 Emacs 28.2 was running OK on my old laptop, and had no problem creating the eln files.
 Any thoughts on what may be going on?

 It's based on the built-in treesit in Emacs 29.1, so you have to update Emacs to the latest version if you want to try this package.
 It supports only a few languages, such as c/cpp, java, rust, python. There is a guide in README to help you add support for other languages.
 Here is an image showing how it looks like. Enjoy it :)

N (counting numbers) are a type of Z (integer) are a type of Q (rational) are a type of R (real) are a type of C (complex)? If Haskell did follow this type structure there would no need for "fromIntegral" and things like this:
 myPlus :: Int -> Double -> Double
 myPlus x y = x + y
 would compile. What is the motivation for the numeric type system Haskell uses? Why are Ints not treated as a subtype of Reals? Maybe I'm missing something and the reason is obvious...but wouldn't it be more logical to follow the usual math type system?

 I'm very happy to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.4 and yampa-test 0.14.4.
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa's features.
 This release introduces a benchmark that can be used to evaluate the performance of a proposed change to Yampa, as well as to compare different ways of writing the same expressions. We hope that the benchmarks will improve and grow over time, and that they will help speed up the process of evaluating pull requests submitted to the project.
 Performance can be tricky to evaluate precisely, so no eyes are too many. We invite everyone to go t…]]></summary>

 Currently working in Scala but have some background in Python and JS,
 I feel very confident in my abilities as a programmer however when it comes to dynamic programming in Scala it's a little tricky, Scala doesn't like circuit breaks so it makes for a bit of a clunky solution when it comes to Leet-code type questions. 
 I was thinking to interview for places in Python or JS because a. my interviewer is much more likely to know one of them and b. it's just much easier for these kind of questions... however it's clear I'm not as fast in those languages as in my everyday work language, so that's a big downside... 
 wdyt, should I ask to be interviewed in another language than my daily Scala?

Do these windows have special properties and is there a way I can account for that in my simple window switcher?

Programming  work/fun:
zkdictionary.py - I'm striving for a fast, efficient way to store key characteristics of my ZK in a dictionary that can be easily and efficiently queried.
I've started to look at creating a modified-over-created note trend to track my rework ratio over new work in my ZK.
Music I'm listening to:
GLY
Jon Kennedy
Alex Cortiz
Parra for Cuva
Emapea
and stuff of that vibe
Things I'm writing about:
Richard Feynman and developing the cognitive skill of curiosity.
Ivan Illiah and the second-order consequences of modernity.
Ideas I'm studying:
Attentions role in experience.

 The yesod-test library seems to have a lot of useful primitives to build on; I’m curious in particular about how folks…
  
initialize test db with fake data 
 mock database calls or just run tests against an in-memory PostgreSQL database
 use dependency injection to mock calls to 3rd party services within handlers
 incorporate effect systems like Polysemy & Effectful into handlers
 create abstractions to make assertions on the response HTML easier
  
I can find very few writings on this topic on the web so any insights from industry would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Hey everyone! Since we have tree-sitter now built into Emacs in the newer versions, I've updated evil-texobj-tree-sitter to work with the builtin treesit package. The queries are not as complete the implementation using elisp-tree-sitter, but should cover most of the common usecases. You can find more information in https://github.com/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter/pull/93
 Removing hard dependency on evil-mode was one other most upvoded issue on the project and so I have added integration with thing-at-point for use without evil-mode. This happen a little while ago, but thought I would add it as well in this update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Check out this Haskell Competitive Programming Template I've created for solving competitive programming challenges (e.g. CodeForces). It covers splitting test cases, input parsing, and output formatting for some common patterns so that you can focus on the algorithm as a pure function.
 I am a Haskell enthuiast who likes to use Haskell for solving coding challenges in competitive programming (like in CodeForces). Over the years, I settled on a common pattern for most solutions which I wanted to share with you all. Most of the times, my main function is just parsing the input into test cases, solving each test case, and then format the output. So, all my IO resides on a single line main program where as the actual solution is a pure function from some input type to some output type.
 Formalizing this pattern in the template, I have a solve function for input type i and output type o:
 solve :: (Parser i, Formatter o) => Splitter -> Solution i o -> IO () solve splitter solution = interact $ unlines . map (format . solution . parse) . splitter . tail . lines 
 I defined 2 type classes - Parser and Formatter - to support parsing and formatting for some common input/output types. Splitter and Solution on the other hand are just type alias.
 class Parser i where parse :: [String] -> i class Formatter o where format :: o -> String type Splitter = [String] -> [[String]] type Solution i o = i -> o 
 I have added few useful instances for Parser and Formatter type classes, but more can be added easily. For the Splitter on the other hand, I just created couple of common splitters - fixedSizeSpliiter when each test case has fixed number of lines and dynamicSizeSpliiter when number of lines per test case can be derived from the first line of each test case.
 Feel free to share your experiences, improvements, or suggestions.

 I am working on something to automatically encode Haskell datastructures as SMT bitvectors. One thing to note is that I am restricting the primitive types to just Int and Bool, this restriction is what makes this task tractable I believe. I am currently somewhat struggling with GHC.Generics.I will outline an example of what I want to achieve here:
 haskell data MyMaybeInt = MyJustInt Int | MyNothingInt 
 Given the above, I want to encode how many bitvectors are necessary to store this particular ADT. We assume that the size of `Int` here is 32 bits.
 For this example the amount of bits needed is 33 (one bit for the tag + max bits needed of all constructors). So the equation for the number of bits needed is: num_bits_for_int(num_constructors) + max_size(constructors).

I have tried various packages for PowerShell, but have found them either incomplete or unmaintained; so about two weeks ago, I decided to try and write my own package, named koopa-mode. 
 koopa-mode is a minimal major mode for PowerShell that has the following features:
  
Syntax highlighting and formatting
 The ability to spawn – and send code to – a PowerShell process in a new buffer
 Autocompletion for cmdlets
  
This is a work in progress and there are a few bugs. Nested indentation does not work as expected and there is this weird bug when using koopa-mode in Windows where autocomplete appends white space to cmdlets. I also started writing Emacs Lisp two weeks ago and have very little experience with LISP, so it is also likely my code is inefficient or just flat out awful. 
 With that said, I love Emacs and want it to thrive, and someone suggested awhile back that the best way to support Emacs is to contribute to it. I wholeheartedly welcome any code contributions or suggestions and hope someone gets some use out of this mode.

I am now using Scala 3, which I think has better metaprogramming capability than Scala 2 without having to use macros. However, I am still somewhat of a novice Scala programmer, especially when it comes to metaprogramming. What I want to do is, given a case class, I need to call an (applicative) function on each of its elements depending on their type and then use mapN to build an instance of the case class. 
 Probably a code sample would say it better than I can.
 ```scala //> using dep "org.typelevel::cats-core:2.9.0" import cats.syntax.all.* import cats.Applicative

 This allows you to interface with Stripe in a simple and functional manner without relying on their Java client. Just model your data as you would with Circe and POST it in the usual manner. Check it out here.
 I wrote this for an e-commerce platform and wanted to share it in case you were looking for something similar.

 I have some kind of love-hate relationship with Haskell since my sophomore year (2 years ago). I feel like I have invested time on it reading through textbooks and solving leet code-style problems with it, but every time I try to do any open-source work, I find myself very dumbfounded by how much I don't understand and wrap my head around.

 I was just wondering is it really that hard or I'm doing something wrong in my approach to learn it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just wrote a blog post trying to separate the Zettelkasten method as a note-taking method (among other things) and other note-taking methods developed for other possible purposes and with different mechanics. Basically the main argument is that any note taken in obsidian, logseq or any other "digital brain" app is not necessarily zettelkasten.
It is written from a somewhat fundamentalist and provocative point of view, basically because I understand that there is a commercial rise in the indication of note-taking as a miracle cure, which can be very frustrating for people who embark on setting up a Zettelkasten unnecessarily.
The article is written in Spanish, but as we all know, it can be automatically translated online using the different online translators available today.
I would like to know what you think of the proposal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been running Doom for a few weeks now and loving it. I'm now trying to build a more organized note-taking system with org and org-roam.
 I recently started getting the following error message with some of my org files on startup:
 Error (org-roam): Failed to process ~/org/example_org_file.org with error Wrong type argument: integer-or-marker-p, nil, skipping... 
 It only happens on some of my files and I really don't know why. One thing that I realized triggers the error is including URLs; deleting all URLS fixed a few of my files. But two remain. One is just a few lines of text. The other is my main index / table of contents.
 I upgraded my system today (Macbook Pro M1), so this may have caused the issue somehow, as it wasn't present even this morning. I'm using the emacs package emacs-macm which upgraded to 29.2 yesterday. I thought that this may have caused it, because I know that Doom doesn't officially support 29.2. But I un-installed and re-installed 28.2 via emacs-plus, and the error persists.
 Can anyone offer any help? I'm happy to provide more info.

 For various corporate reasons I'm using EMACS on Windows 10, with a shared folder tree to a Vagrant VM. I tried running emacs in the VM but even with a local X server the performance isn't great.
 I'm a "lite" poweruser under Linux and I have a lot of stuff like flyspell, flymake, lsp etc, Prelude, that I like to have configured.
 Now, a lot of the packages I use rely on Linux utilities (aspell, lsp server, etc) which are not available under Windows 10.
 I could possibly install cygwin but are there other options which I am overlooking? Can I get EMACS inside the VM running faster? Maybe use emacs-server? Does anyone have any suggestions to improve this configuration?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs community!
 I'm thrilled to introduce igist, a powerful Emacs package designed to streamline your GitHub Gist management workflow. While there are existing Gist Emacs packages, igist stands out due to its extensive set of features that ensure you never have to leave Emacs to manage your gists effectively.
 Here's why you should consider using igist over other Gist Emacs packages:
  
Comprehensive Feature Set: igist offers an array of features that cover all aspects of gist management, including creating, editing, deleting, starring, unstarring, forking, and exploring public gists. With igist, you have everything you need to manage your gists seamlessly within Emacs.
 
Interactive Gist Exploration: Explore and discover the latest public gists conveniently sorted by the most recently updated. igist provides an interactive interface to browse and stay up-to-date with the vibrant GitHub Gist community.
 
Comment Support: igist enables you to add, list, edit, and delete comments on your gists. This feature allows for efficient collaboration and communication directly from Emacs, keeping your workflow smooth and focused.
 
Robust Authentication: igist ensures authentication with your GitHub account using either the secure method with auth-source or you setup it on your own . This flexibility caters to different security preferences without compromising usability.
 
Active Development: igist is actively maintained and developed. You can expect regular updates, bug fixes, and new features to enhance your gist management experience in Emacs.
 
 Install it from MELPA or clone the repository to experience the power of igist today. Your feedback and contributions are valuable in shaping the continued development of this package.

 I find there are some operators do not exists in Akka/Pekko stream now but exists in RxJava/Flux etc , Seems people are still happy with it?
 Fs2 and ZIO have rich set of operators too.
 So what operators do you wanted but still missing?

        <updated>2023-08-06T12:19:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I have a particular issue related to indentation when using braces and brackets inside tabular-like environments handled by AUCTeX. I am using AUCTeX 13.2.1 with Emacs 29.1.
 Things work all right within regular content. As such, the following code is correctly formatted
 latex { xxxx { zzz } } [ yyy ] 
 Custom environments are also correctly formatted
 \begin{aaaa} { xxx } [ yyy ] \end{aaaa} 
 However, tabular as well as any other tabular-like environment handled by AUCTeX does not respect indentation; here, what I mean by handled is those environments whose formatting is set to LaTeX-env-tabular as well any other environment I append using LaTeX-add-environments and set to LaTeX-env-tabular.
 As an example, as soon as talltblr is on the list handled by AUCTEX, Emacs does not indent content inside brackets
 \begin{talltblr}[ caption = {Somthing}, label = {tab:something}, % ... ] { colspec = {Q[l] X[c,m] Q[3cm,mode=math]}, hlines, vlines, row{1} = {font=\bfseries}, } X & X & X \\\\ Y & Y & Y \end{talltblr} 
 I expect the following would be the correct formatting
 \begin{talltblr}[ caption = {Somthing}, label = {tab:something}, % ..., ] { colspec = {Q[l] X[c,m] Q[3cm,mode=math]}, hlines, vlines, row{1} = {font=\bfseries}, } X & X & X \\\\ Y & Y & Y \end{talltblr} 
 One obvious solution is to remove or not to include environments in the list. However, I really like how AUCTeX formats tables. It adds required indentation between & and \\ to show where inner environments start. Hence, the code is much clearer and more readable with multiple inner and nested tabulars. The indentation would be a great addition to it.
 I ask this question in hope that perhaps someone has already sorted it out. I would also be grateful for any clues and pointers to start with.
 Thanks

 - the classic remoting is using netty 3.10.6 which has CVEs
 - the classic remoting code is not been touched for years
 - the new Artery is better for spliting the control message and user messages etc.
 - Akka just removed the classic transport in 2.8.0.
 ​
 There are two options now:
  
Remove it totally at the next 1.1.0 release, reduce the maintenance burden.
 Fix the CVEs by upgrade to Netty 4 in 1.1.0 but remove it in 1.2.0

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am new to emacs and trying to build it from the source for native compilation. I actually want to install 28.1, as it is officially supported by doom. I have tried using emacs-plus, but it only has 28.2 and doesn't give me a clickable app (there might be some flags here which I am unaware of). But the important thing is I am unable to get 28.1.
 Then I decided to build from source, but I am continuously getting the error:
 checking for dlfunc... no
 usage: dirname string [...]
 checking for gcc_jit_context_acquire in -lgccjit... no
 configure: error: ELisp native compiler was requested, but libgccjit was not found.
 Please try installing libgccjit or a similar package.
 If you are sure you want Emacs be compiled without ELisp native compiler,
 pass the --without-native-compilation option to configure.
 I do have libgccjit installed and added it to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. I am not quite sure why emacs is not able to find libgccjit?
 Or if there is any simpler way to install emacs 28.1 from a mirror with native compilation and all the defaults (--cask), it would be ideal.
 Let me know if any additional material is required from my end.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I can see, the single biggest feature org-roam adds to what "plain" org-mode already has is back-linking.[1] I'm wondering just how useful that is in practice.
 My own (limited) experience showed that org-roam is definitely a step up from org-roam when it comes to creating back-links. But just how significant that step up is depends on how much use I'd make of those back-links when subsequently reading my org-roam nodes. And that is hard to assess without first building up a big enough set of nodes.
 So my question is addressed to those who have made a sufficiently serious move into org-roam to have built up a decent database of nodes (and, as a result, back-links). To those people my question is:
 Just how useful do you find back-links -- i.e. not the back-linking process, but the links themselves, when reading/reviewing/interacting with your notes -- to be in practice? 
 thx.
 [1] I guess searching might be a bit easier too, along with node name completion. But back-linking seems to be The Big Thing.

I am currently in search for a good software solution to design visuals and diagrams for my work. Here are some examples that I made using draw.io:



For the book, Christian created more visually pleasing images:


Most of the time, I ignore my software and use the image capture function of The Archive which vastly (!) speeds up my process (important to me). The images look like this:


All images protected by copyright 4.0 (enforced by Interpol, Blackrock, the Illuminati, my secret identity and third personality). So, to the lurker who likes to "borrow/bite" other people ideas:

I'd like to improve my visual game.
I'd like to stop pestering Christian if I need something more pretty.
Sometimes, I use using software as a creative technique.
In few cases, I just want something pretty for myself.
And what is better than appropriate skills by just buying shiny tools? Currently, I am looking at OmniGraffle. But perhaps, you have something way better for visuals like the above?
Many thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, with match types we can easily express "type of the first tuple element":
 type FirstElement[T <: Product] = T match { case head *: _ => head } val good: FirstElement[(String, Int)] = "yep" // val badAsExpected: FirstElement[(Int, String)] = "nope" // error 
 How to do the same for case classes? Using the same match type 
 case class Foo(a: String, b: Int) val wishThisWasGood: FirstElement[Foo] = "but it isn't" 
 predictably fails with match type reduction failed. It would be great to have a parity of generic programming features for tuples and case classes.
 Another related question please. I'm trying to define a match type and a corresponding function that filters elements of type String from a generic tuple. It works on type level:
 type OnlyStrings[X <: Tuple] <: Tuple = X match case EmptyTuple => EmptyTuple case x *: xs => x match case String => String *: OnlyStrings[xs] case _ => OnlyStrings[xs] val works: OnlyStrings[(String, Int, String, Long)] = ("", "") 
 but fails on value level:
 def onlyStrings[X <: Tuple](x: X): OnlyStrings[X] = x match case EmptyTuple => EmptyTuple // Found: EmptyTuple.type, Required: std.OnlyStrings[X] (...) case x *: xs => x match case s: String => s *: onlyStrings(xs) // Found: String *: std.OnlyStrings[Tuple], Required: std.OnlyStrings[X] (...) case _ => onlyStrings(xs) // Found: (xs : Tuple), Required: X 
 this one should be fixable with a more clever type bound, right?

 The underlining only happens for some headings and starts at different places. I would like to either fix it or just remove all the underlining styling. The screenshot above is using solarized. But similar things exist for other themes:

 this is with catppuccin theme. Only some of the headings have an extra dark background.
 I tried booting emacs with the only customization being the theme and the issue still exists.
 Does anyone know how to remove or stop these themes from trying to do extra styling. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I am wondering what the current state of the Web Assembly back-end is for GHC? Is the best way to compile to wasm to use the back-end from ghc-wasm-meta? Also, does anyone have any information about how to call functions written in Haskell in a browser? In my experiments with C++, one can tell emscripten to keep certain functions in the wasm binary by prefixing their return type with "EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE". Is there a Haskell equivalent for this?
 EDIT: I think my answer I was looking for can be found here. It seems like this is how you get to keep haskell functions in the wasm binary. I am not entirely sure how to match up JavaScript types with Haskell's, though.

 Probably one of the most discussed topics right after Data related ones!
 Yet, we all know things are moving at a fast pace lately.
 I am looking for a lean library without much fuss around easy to manage and set-up for a, as of rn, one man show project. 
 I came along big frameworks like 'play' saw akkahttp to be very popular and of course lately Zio.http.
 Play seems to be very very big and asking for a big learning curve. Akka longs like the mongo(db) of the scala world - not really liking the direction they went w/ their licensing change which happened before I even heard of - I still do not know how to asses the risk of Zio doing it alike.
 I have only very small needs:
 -postgresql driver
 -lightweight threads
 -simple http handling
 I haven't settled on how to server the FE yet, would be nice to find something which integrate nicely but using other tech isn't the end of the world.
 I 'just' need to have simple CRUD on the backend. 
 Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I read there are no standard libraries for that, right?
 What are you using on your backend projects and why? 
 Would be amazing to hear from you guys and your enormous experience!
 ​
 Thanks & Cheeers!

 I'm sick of writing notes to my phone. Anyone have any good workflow recommendations for a Google Pixel 7 running termux as well as a Raspberry Pi device on LAN?
 ​
 Asking since I'm debating if I should just use Emacs via Termux (although probably clunky) and just make note files that get ingested into a folder on LAN that later get slurped up and incorporated as new tasks under a '* Phone Notes' heading or something.
 I'm also planning to probably use Syncthing on LAN too somehow to facilitate the syncing.
 ​
 Curious for your thoughts thanks!

 In the source code for Treemacs, I found: (doom-modeline-def-modeline 'treemacs '(bar " " major-mode))

 I already tried the following, which kinda works, but I would like to add it to the use-package-statement as configuration and this doesn’t seem to work. I was wondering if someone here already has made customisations to show the current workspace-name from Treemacs in the doom-modeline.
 (doom-modeline-def-segment treemacs-workspace-name "The current treemacs workspace name or number. Requires `treemacs-mode' to be enabled." (when doom-modeline-workspace-name (when-let ((name (cond ((and (fboundp 'treemacs-mode) (eq major-mode 'treemacs-mode)) (treemacs-workspace->name (treemacs-current-workspace)))))) (propertize (format "- %s" name) 'face (doom-modeline-face 'doom-modeline-buffer-major-mode)))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am a medical student from Argentina. I discovered the Zettelkasten method a while ago and was very interested in it, and I wanted to introduce you to my "study method" (actually it is much more comprehensive than a study method).
I did this method in the format of a planner or agenda, which can be downloaded in PDF at www.researchsheets.wordpress.com
This planner has 10 sections, but the method I want to show you corresponds to "section 7: Research sheets". They consist of a template similar to the Cornell method in appearance (top margin, left margin and bottom margin), but with a totally different operation, since these "Research sheets" will serve us to hierarchize and breake down the information, and then add it to a glossary / thesaurus in Microsoft Excel.
The procedure itself is somewhat difficult to explain, so I prefer not to confuse you further and invite you to download the planner and go directly to section 7 - Research sheets.
As I said at the beginning, I think it has some similarities with the Zettelkasten method. I hope my method is useful to you and I am available for any questions or comments.
Thank you very much for reading me!]]></summary>

 It doesn't do anything to associate this with dart files from what I can gather. Has someone trawled through the docs and made this work with Dart? My understanding, after taking a brief overview, is that I need a dart-ts-mode and dart-mode maps to this. The creation of this mode is beyond my scope. (I had a cursory look into c-ts-mode but backed out as it doesn't look trivial ;))
 It's not critical to have, but since I'm doing a small flutter project I thought I'd ask.

Add any configuration which relies on after-init-hook, emacs-startup-hook, etc to elpaca-after-init-hook so it runs after Elpaca has activated all queued packages. This includes loading of saved customizations. e.g.
 (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "customs.el" user-emacs-directory)) (add-hook 'elpaca-after-init-hook (lambda () (load custom-file 'noerror))) 
  
I don't really use the customize feature, anyway, but my config has had the following lines in it since "forever",
 (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory)) (when (file-exists-p custom-file) (load custom-file)) 
 and it was never attached to any hooks. Let's say that I did, some day, use the customize UI to customize a package in my Emacs. When would be the appropriate time to load my customizations file? Before my packages are loaded? After? What would happen if I load a customization for a package that doesn't exist yet, because I'm at a new computer and the package is being downloaded/installed for the first time?

 I have a CSS file, and I am exporting org-mode documents using this CSS as html (the target being pdf documents). It works so far with html. I have been tweaking the CSS file so that my exported doc enforces the company style sheets and looks.
 What I am missing is my logo to be displayed in the top left corner as it would be on any company letter.
 How to instruct org-mode so that this logo is displayed properly in every page of every document.
 I guess this must be added somehow in some property in the org with the size and position ... or maybe in the CSS? I am lost, please help!

 data Config = Config { -- multiple record fields: configXXX :: YYY , (...) } modify config = do config <- m0 config config <- m1 config config <- m2 config -- etc. return config 
 But if we are not working in a monad:
 modify config = let config' = f0 config config'' = f1 config' config''' = f2 config'' in config''' 
 is confusing, it's easy to choose the wrong config.
 So how is this pattern usually solved? Using the Identity monad`?
 Also, since this example use a datatype with multiple record fields, and maybe data in several layers, how can we uses lenses to solve the pattern? I'm not used to lenses.

 EDIT: It was immediately brought to my attention that using magit and evil in the following example is, indeed, a poor example because of magit being autoloaded by calling magit-status. Let's just pretend we're talking about some other packages, instead.
 magit defines a function called magit-status, and evil defines a function called evil-ex-define-cmd, and I'd like to use it to define an ex-command for magit-status.
 So, somewhere in my init.el, I'll have to write: (evil-ex-define-cmd "git" #'magit-status)

 $ emacs -nw -q -l /Users/xxxxx/.emacs.d/scimax/init.el 
 It started with I decided to upgrade to emacs 29 using Brew following JKitchin's page, 
 I cleaned out Emacs 28 built from source, 
 I installed Emacs 29 with 
 $ brew install --cask emacs ... Worked very well, got me a useable emacs 29.1, the installation moved the emacs.app to Applications,
 Do not bother with 
 alias emacs='$(/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -nw)'
 in .zshrc.
 I upgraded to the latest scimax using Github Desktop and copying the scimax folder to 
 /Users/xxxxx/.emacs.d/scimax/ 
 There are other little bits of tweaking, but they are easy stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I just switched to emacs coming from a vim background and was wondering about the integration of evil-mode into notmuch. Currently, major modes like org-mode and magit are supported thankfully (using evil-collection) but unfortunately, I haven't come across a good way to integrated evil-mode with notmuch. Much of the bindings of notmuch and evil-mode overlap with each other, thus hampering the bindings of notmuch. Currently, I'm just disabling evil-mode in every notmuch buffer and am using the standard emacs bindings.
 So as per the title, is there a way to integrated notmuch and evil-mode? Or perhaps use just a subset of evil-mode in a notmuch buffer (like simple "j" and "k" for moving around for example).
 Thanks in advance!

 sorry for asking you to do my job, but I'm trying to assess how much "future proof" is a scala codebase we inherited that we are interested in making the primary product for my company. I just studied a bit the language (and I loved it), observed the ecosystem and lurked here and somewhere else, but I'm not able to do this kind of risk assessment on my own as I might be influenced by some echo-chamber effect. I'm also incredibly sorry for being not precise in my descriptions, again I'm not super familiar with the ecosystem.
 The codebase has around 6-7 years I guess, and it's a Scala 2 100k LoC web api backend based on a Play multiproject setup (many folders with an sbt project inside + a sbt project outside in the root folder, no src/main/scala structure).

I've tried the old GTK version and the Webrender fork in the past and now recently tried the pGTK version. They all run extremely slowly. I don't have exact measurements but were talking ballpark half a second for anything to happen when I hit a key. It gets much better when I disable transparency but it's still far, far behind the X toolkit version.
 Based on what I've seen elsewhere I was expecting the pGTK version to be faster (like the tui version which is noticeably better than X) or at the very least equivalent with the X toolkit version.
 I installed Emacs via nix from the emacs-overlay.
 What am I doing wrong that it's so slow?

 I heard scala has an amazing community and I happy to join it as of right now!
 I recently was looking for a new stack for my next webapp projects. After working with golang for some weeks I was just frustrated on how bad the documentation is. As a former Java Developer I felt home right away with scala. Considering that I heavily do in data engineering and not being a fan of the Python Syntax and especially not pip I might found my swiss-army-knife with Scala!
 Still getting around with this massive eco-system. especially since it seems like it works just fine with every Java related (such as frameworks, libs) I throw at my scala projects it will just do fine.
 I am also very excited to know that there are even Javascript and LLVM compiler to run system target bins.
 Seems like one language/ecosystem to rule them all. 
 How did you end up here?
 I mean kotlin does also make bold claims and golang is super hip, isn't it?

 What would be the best approach here, to have the file selected in the minibuffer (fuzzy matching) used as a target in the capture template?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like there's been tons of threads on this topic but they just left me feeling more unsure after looking through them. Here are my concerns which mostly revolve around Org-mode:
  
CommonMark vs Org-mode for writing only? I feel like the only advantage of the Org syntax are footnotes and tables.
 
Is the Org syntax set in stone? Like if I don't use any advanced features or extensions will my org files be fine with future updates to Org-mode? I have heard stories of org files being outdated and breaking.
 
Does large org files get slow (50k-70k words though I doubt my files will ever get that big)? 
 
Reference management on Emacs vs Neovim? 
 
Is exporting from Org-mode to Docx easy? According to this article there're still issues with the final output Docx files sadly, cause then I will have to open up Pages to fix them which may cause further formatting issues.
 
Org on Emacs vs Org on Neovim?
 
Is Emacs or Neovim better for LaTeX?
 
Is Emacs much slower than Neovim? I only plan to open it when working on a project and not to take notes all the time so a bit slow startup time is acceptable - being slow while working is unacceptable though.
 
Is Emacs high maintenance?
 
 And if I do choose to use Emacs, should I use Doom-Emacs or just the vanilla config files - I heard Doom disabled some obsolete settings which make it faster/the same speed despite having pre-installed extensions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working with orgmode every day for two years now and I love it. Recently, I switched from using tables to using column view for some use cases, and there are many advantages for me in that. What I am missing in column view is hl-line-mode. Sometimes it is difficult for me when being at the far right with the cursor, to see in the far left what line I am in and what values correspondent to the ones in the far right.
 Hl-line-mode is turned on, but it doesn't highlight the current line when in column view. Does anyone of you know of a way to make it work? Thanks in advance for your help!

 Anyone knows why Scala behaves this way? Or if this is indeed objectively a wart or it is a subjective thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Emacs community,
 I am trying to recreate the RStudio layout for the ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics) mode. This is I want to improve the ESS module in doom (here it is the feature branch).
 I have made good progress, but I'm currently stuck on one aspect.
 Here's the code I have so far:
 (defun my-rstudio-layout () "" (interactive) (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist `("^\\*help\\[R\\]" (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (slot . 1) (window-width . 0.33) (reusable-frames . nil))) (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist `("^\\*xwidget-webkit*." (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (slot . 1) (window-width . 0.33) (reusable-frames . nil))) (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist `("^\\*R.*\\*" (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-at-bottom) (window-width . 0.5) (dedicated . t))) (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist `("^\\*R dired\\*" (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (slot . -1) (window-width . 0.33) (reusable-frames . nil))) (let ((ess-startup-directory 'default-directory) (ess-ask-for-ess-directory nil)) (delete-other-windows) (ess-switch-to-ESS t) (ess-help "help") (ess-rdired))) 
 My problem is with the xwidget buffer. I would like it to open in the same window as the help buffer, using a tab (activating tab-bar-mode, of course). 
 I aim to achieve something similar to this: https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/images/RStudio_Screenshot_Labels.png
 Would anyone know how I could achieve this? I've been struggling to figure out how because the manual isn't clear about what variables we can use in the display-buffer-alist. 
 Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance! 
 PS. Any other suggestions or hints about this function are also appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 To preface, I am brand new to emacs and am currently exploring what it has to offer. I setup a simple init.el file like so:
 ``` ;; Set up package.el to work with MELPA (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
 ;; Download Evil (unless (package-installed-p 'evil) (package-install 'evil))
 ;; Download Catppuccin (unless (package-installed-p 'catppuccin-theme) (package-install 'catppuccin-theme))
 ;; Enable Evil (require 'evil) (evil-mode 1)
 ;; Enable Catppuccin (load-theme 'catppuccin :no-confirm) (setq catppuccin-flavor 'mocha) (catppuccin-reload)
 (custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. '(package-selected-packages '(catppuccin-theme evil))) (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. ) ```
 It works perfectly on Ubuntu running under WSL, it does not quite work on straight Windows 11. On Windows 11 it does set the theme to Catppuccin so I know it's sourcing the init.el file correctly but it evil mode doesn't start working until after I manually toggle it via (M-x evil-mode)
 Also, if it makes a difference, I am using 28.2 on both WSL and straight Windows. 
 It's just a minor inconvenience but if there is something I am missing that will fix it then I am all ears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I have upgraded my emacs to 29 from 28 and got a lot of packages complaining after fresh download from elpa. I use custom emacs with doom theme and lots of other packages, namely counsel, ivy, lsp, projectile, some minor ones. Suddenly, lsp started to complain a lot with warnings, projectile stopped running my projects with qemu (but pure terminal works), a lot of other problems -- warnings in different packages. What are the basic steps I need to check after an upgrade? Yes, I have downloaded all packages from scratch but problems are still there.
 Right now, the most annoying thing is the way I run qemu with tun/tap interface enabled. If I run from separate console, my project starts as expected. If I run it as a command for projectile/run, qemu cannot open tap interface (resource is busy). Manual check of env in console/projectile does not show any significant differences.
 Edit: a bit more details

        <updated>2023-08-02T13:45:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The previous tree-sitter package was just a minor mode, and this made it much easier to migrate to and use. Having a new major mode means that all hooks, key-bindings, major-mode checks, use-package’s, derived modes, and config need to be duplicated twice. And it's not only your own user config, but all packages need to add support for each new mode, even if they don't care about tree-sitter. 
 Given that, the core developers must have had good reasons for not going the minor-mode route. Does anyone know some of the trade-offs that were considered? Maybe a link to the Devel discussion about it?

 ```lisp
 1=(lambda (n)
  "factorial" (if (zerop n) 1 (* n (funcall #1# (1- n)))))

 This will signal an error caused by the endless lambda macro expansion.
 Quote it
 ```lisp
 1='(lambda ... #1#)
 ```
 is a good idea, but ... then we cannot use lexical binding.
 They ((lambda ...) and '(lambda ...)) are different; as you can see:
 lisp '(lambda ()) ;; => (lambda nil) (lambda ()) ;; => (closure (t) nil) 
 Modify the byte-code
 ```lisp (byte-compile (lambda (n) (if (zerop n) 1 (* n (funcall '_ (1- n)))))) ;; => ^ placeholder

 Ah! Nice~ We can replace the placeholder _. Let's take advantage of vector's self-quotation:
 lisp (#1=#[257 "\211\300U\203\0\301\207\211\302S!_\207" [0 1 #1#] 4] 5) ;; => 120

 However, I usually don't notice until I compile the file, which tells me that I have a n or p somewhere and have to track it down, and there's not always a line number. 
 If I use I-search-forwards these accidentally inserted characters are hard to track down, because there are so many legitimate uses of n and p
 Does anyone have any ideas on a way to make catching these rascals easier?

The idea is, that i want to create an svg-tag (Package), that opens a URL on click. That's the part i've got working. But now, the tag itself should be part of the url, which i can't get to work.
 So, this works
  (setq svg-tag-tags ("\\(ASGUPD\-[#0-9]+\\)" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag)) (lambda () (interactive) (browse-url "https://jira.internal.de/browse/")) "Open in Browser")) )) 
 But this doesn't
  (setq svg-tag-tags ("\\(ASGUPD\-[#0-9]+\\)" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag)) (lambda (tag) (interactive) (browse-url (concat "https://jira.internal.de/browse/" tag))) "Open in Browser")) )) 
 This is what i have come up with so far. When running this i get the Error
  Wrong number of arguments: (lambda (tag) (interactive) (browse-url (concat "https://elara-jira.elara-gmbh.de/browse/" tag))), 0 
 I'm not sure if the tag is even available at that point. I assumed that it would work the same as creating the tag. Am i doing something obviously wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In order to have a more comfortable keyboard layout I've switched the Crtl key with the Alt key and Alt with Win-logo key using xmodmap. This makes transitioning between my Ubuntu desktop and Macbook pretty seemless and doesn't kill my little finger. ;)
 In Emacs 27 this worked fine, Emacs 29 thinks I'm hitting multiple keys when pressing Alt or Win-logo.
 Alt+x should be C-x but I get A-C-x
 Win-logo+x should be: M-x but is M-s-x 
 How can I fix this?
 My init.el has these changes to make it work in previous versions of emacs:
 ;; xfce key-bindings
 (setq x-meta-keysym 'super
 x-super-keysym 'meta)
 ;; use fn key as control, maps better to my dasKeyboard setup
 (setq ns-function-modifier 'control)
 This is the content of my .xmodmap file:
 clear control
 clear mod1
 clear mod4
 keycode 133 = Super_L
 keycode 64 = Alt_L
 keycode 37 = Control_L
 remove control = Control_L
 remove mod4 = Super_L
 remove mod1 = Alt_L
 add control = Alt_L
 add mod1 = Super_L
 add mod4 = Control_L

 Funny how that is....emacs user wants nuanced control. Are there any existing packages or easy elisp to enable this type of function? Was low key hoping it would work with C-u C-c C-o but that was a no go.

 The TL;DR is as follows.
 My capture templates usually end with \n%?. That is intended to position point on a new line in the capture buffer, ready for me to type in whatever text I want. And it has always done exactly that. However, what I now see is that where I have a template that clocks in, AND if I am storing clock info in a drawer, then that positioning goes awry. Instead of point being positioned at the start of a new line, it is placed right on top of the clock drawer. That forces me to manually move the cursor down before starting to type.

Even if you were to use sed or awk to make the passcmd work with .authinfo (to avoid duplicating the password), you will not be using the emacs interface promot to enter the password but gpg’s.
 Here is what i’ve been doing instead, I’ve this elisp function;
 (require 'auth-source) (defun salih/get-mail-password () (let* ((auth-info (auth-source-search :host "mail.gmx.com" :require '(:user :secret))) (password (funcall (plist-get (car auth-info) :secret)))) password)) 
 It will return the password associated with the host. If the file is encrypted you are promoted to enter your passphrase with epa.
 Since I run emacs as a daemon, we can eval this function in the command line like this emacsclient -e "(let ((inhibit-message t)) (salih/get-mail-password))" you will be promoted in the emacs session you are running.
 If you run this in a shell it is going to return the password with double quotes, but we can workaround that using simple string substitution in the shell. here is the final script;
 #!/usr/bin/env sh output="$(emacsclient -e "(let ((inhibit-message t)) (salih/get-mail-password))")" output_without_quotes="${output//\"/}" echo "$output_without_quotes"

Delete the transclusion
 Go to the running weekly tracking file
 copy/refile it into my 5 daily files that are long term stored 
 delete it from the running weekly tracking file. 
  
What I would like to be able to do i.e. a sort of baking in of the source to everywhere it is linked.

 search for the use of this heading as a transclusion across my org files
 overwrite the transclusion with the actual text. 
  
Before I go writing the custom elisp for this which seems like a bear. I wanted to confirm if anyone knows a simple way to achieve this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow Haskellers! I'm new to the functional programming world and wanted to give creating a Blackjack program a shot.
 Here's the code
 Any comments or critiques are welcome! I do have a few specific areas for feedback:
  
When inserting a State function in the StateT function, I have to use something like
 (a,s) <- runState f <$> get
 put s
 
 which seems very clunky. Is there a better pattern to use?
  
I couldn't figure out a clean way for hands that are split to disqualify from being blackjacks. Any ideas?
 
I'm not super fluent in testing. How do I test IO portions of the code? Such as my function Actions.getValidTurnActions which requires the user to input a line.
 
 Thanks for taking a look at a beginner's code. Much appreciated!

 Recently left Spacemacs in favour of rolling my own config for a variety of reasons. It took me a few weeks to put together. There were a lot of people that said, "you can just put something together in the space of a weekend"; that was very much NOT the case for me, having gotten used to functionality from Spacemacs, and also wanting certain things.
 Anyway, this is the first time I've put something like this together, and I'd love if anyone felt like taking a look and offering some criticisms/insights.

That is, I often need to jump somewhere in the current line, and I wish to type until the match is unique, at which point the jump should be performed automatically (like the former command already does). I could just use avy-goto-char-timer, but it would show all other matches in the buffer, so making it unique is harder and sometimes impossible, so I have to press the target key(s).
 Looking at the implementations, I'm a bit stuck though, as avy-goto-char-in-line uses avy-jump for scoping, which is based on regexes, but avy-goto-char-timer gets the candidate list with avy--read-candidates, where I don't see how I would scope to the current line (and which looks harder to extend, as it's quite complex). Is there an easy way I'm overlooking?

 ;; Comment syntax: <# #> denotes a multi-line comment (modify-syntax-entry ?\< "< 1" st) (modify-syntax-entry ?\# ". 23b" st) (modify-syntax-entry ?\> "> 4" st) 
 It successfully comments out the lines
 <# This is a multi-line comment #> 
 But unfortunately also comments out the 10 in $x < 10.
 I have not been able to find any good examples in either the documentation or SO, but the documentation on syntax tables seems to indicate this would be the correct approach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When trying to use tree-sitter modes I run into many silly problems.
 Take c-mode for example:
  
References to c-mode-hook.
 Key bindings that reference c-mode-map.
 use-package references to c-mode.
 My own functions that check: (member major-mode '(c-mode c++-mode objc-mode))
 Basically my whole configuration assumes C/C++ use c-mode or c++-mode and having to add checks for c-ts-mode is a hassle, enough that I don't use c-ts-mode at all.
  
Is there some solution that doesn't involve every check for c-mode also checking for c-ts-mode ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unfortunately, some packages think a symlink file is different from the one it links to. eg Treemacs follow wont work if the treemacs workspace says "symlink/file.txt" but the file opened is "~/long/path/file.txt". Understandable. Now I dont know the ins and outs of that complexity but certainly my use case would be simplified if consult-buffer could be configured to ignore the longer path so I dont open that file via the long path and the buffer indeed has a reference of ~/symlink/file.txt. eg see here , a picture makes it easier to understand : I'd like to see one or the other filtered so I can have some concistency in my buffer opening.
 Can anything be done or is there something already available? Or do I just need to suck it up and be more careful as to what path I use?

 let this be the HTTP request I'm trying to highlight:
 GET /print_hello_world HTTP/2.0 host: mydomain.com te: trailers sec-fetch-site: cross-site sec-fetch-mode: no-cors sec-fetch-dest: image accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br accept-language: en-US,en;q=0.5 accept: image/avif,image/webp,*/* {"hello" :"world"} 
 now in the first line want to highlight the first line GET with a face and the endpoint /print_hello_world with another face I tried using:
 (setq font-lock-defaults '(,((rx line-start (or "GET" "POST") symbol-start (one-or-more (any alphanumeric punct)) symbol-end space) . 'my-http-endpoint-font) ,((rx line-start symbol-start (or "GET" "POST") symbol-end) . 'my-http-method-font))) 
 but this will only highlight the method not the endpoint.
 the same goes for header values, I tried using this:
 (setq font-lock-defaults '((,(rx line-start symbol-start (one-or-more (any alphanumeric ?- ?_)) symbol-end ": ") . 'my-http-header-key-face ) (,(rx ": " symbol-start (one-or-more not-newline) symbol-end eol) . 'my-http-header-value-face ))) 
 this will highlight only the header with its face but not the value.
 I tried to check python-mode for how it is done but I didn't understand how it is structuring it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I use emacs in client/server mode by running emacs --daemon --nw at login and then running emacsclient -c to open new frames.
 After upgrading Arch linux this morning to emacs 29.1, my clients can no longer find the socket to connect to emacs. The daemon command runs and outputs the usual startup messages, but it's like it doesn't finish loading fully and never executes the daemon.
 I tried emacs -q --daemon --nw and this worked, so the problem is in my init somewhere. Ugh.
 I tried --debug-init but it found no problems. The only output I get in Messages is:
 Error loading autoloads: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory /home/alanm/.emacs.d/elpa/yaml-mode-20230714.440/yaml-mode-autoloads) Loading /home/alanm/.emacs.d/orgmode_customizations.el (source)...done Loading /home/alanm/.emacs.d/email.el (source)...done Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode...done For information about GNU Emacs and the GNU system, type C-h C-a. Package cl is deprecated 
 I'm not sure what is trying to load cl. It's nowhere in my config, and the only cl- packages I have installed show as builtins. Not sure what's up with yaml-mode, but I don't think that's it because the problem was happening before I updated yaml. I've also tried commenting out my orgmode and email external .el files, and that didn't help, so the issue is in the init file directly.
 I can run server-start in an emacs window and then connect, but I'd like to have a background daemon running instead.
 Any ideas? Here is my init.el, if it helps: https://pastebin.com/GNzhwcqU

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wasn't expecting the mac os upgrade to torch my emacs (sigh). I'm gun shy on just upgrading emacs ala brew because I don't wind to wind up going down the "fix up" rabbit hole when I'm trying to get work done... so looking here for someone to tell me the latest brew emacs is all good for the latest mac before I take the plunge.
 (I was so happy emacs was getting tamed, really wasn't expecting this kind of interaction... is this common on mac os upgrades?)
 Thanks for any info or tips. (I'm trying to stay as vanilla as possible in my emacs setup).
 ​
 EDIT: After googling around I found mention of this being fixed in the 29 branch. But also found a one liner fix to avoid upgrading in flow. So, for anyone else hitting this:
 (add-to-list 'image-types 'svg)
 will do the trick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 ​
 ​
 I come from Rmarkdown, trying to reproduce some of my previous workflow. I made most everything the way I wanted. However, I like to keep html reports from my analyses, in rmarkdown I would generate standalone html files, ie, they dont point to png plots outside of the file, the plots are embedded in the html.
 ​
 - Is there a way to do this in orgmode export? So that the resulting html is including the plots, instead of pointing to the files locally?
 ​
 Thank you!

 Do you have any experience? How you implemented your Zettelkasten? And how you synchronize among different systems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Like many of you I am upgrading my init.el to emacs 29.1
 To be able to bind C-i differently from <tab> in GUI, I had the following snippet, it works. But I have never properly understood how/why
 (define-key input-decode-map "\C-i" [C-i]) (global-set-key [C-i] (lambda()(interactive)(message "Ctrl + I"))) 
 Now, define-key is flagged as obsolete, replaced by keymap-set.
 However I can't seem to make the same lines work with keymap-set. I have tried replacing [C-i] by "<C-i>" since (kbd "<C-i">) returns [C-i], but it does not pass the is-valid-key-p check.
 Any key-binding guru here, ready to settle the matter and help me and others understand the proper way to achieve this with the new API ?
 I know I could leave it as is, or rebind stuff to Hyper-I, but that's not a satisfying answer
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, can anyone help me choose between neovim and emacs? I know what I want from an editor and am ready to spend a lot of time customizing one of these editors, but I don't want to do it twice. So I will tell my preferences and it would be really great to get your advice.
  
I prefer to use an editor in terminal, without additional gui. As far as I know neovim is tui app, while emacs is not. However, I can run emacs in my terminal. How much I lost not using gui version of emacs?
 
I want to create and edit notes and to-do's using an editor. I am not going to use it as a calendar as I prefer to use apple calendar on my macbook and iphone. How many advantages does org-mode have over simple md? Also I've read about org-mode for neovim...
 
I want to try to use an editor as ide too. I'm angular developer and I'm working on rather large project (main project contains about 7k files). I'm worried about the performance of the autocomplete. Unfortunately, I failed to find ready-made configs for emacs and neovim to open the project and see for myself.
 
I definitely don't want to use my editor as browser, gaming platform, email client, window manager etc etc. Honestly, looks like neovim is winner here :)
 
I don't want to use something like spacemacs, emacs-doom, etc., just self-written configs. And I don't know what is better in this case - elisp or lua/vimscript.
 
I have no preference between emacs or vim hotkeys. Both are good.
 
Emacs startup time is significantly worse than neovim's, even though I have very few plugins installed. Can I fix it without using client-server? It's not a big problem, but it's annoying.
 
 So i'm looking for a lightweight and fast editor for notes and development on angular. Should I spend my time on emacs or neovim? Thanks for your opinion and sorry for my english, I'm not native.

 Please recommend how can i get syntax check and some language completion in emacs for springboot and groovy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I was using linum-mode in my Emacs 28. But when I upgraded to 29.1, this function was gone.
 I found a function called line-number-mode, which has no visible effect.
 Then I found display-line-numbers-mode, which seems to have the same effect as the old linum-mode.
 Why there are so many line number related functions and which one should I use?

I have added dap-mode and enabled dap and dap-ui.
 
Then I wrote a tiny .js file and tried debugging it in VSCode and it worked. VSCode even created .vscode/launch.json for me.
 
Then, I tried dap-node-setup which has failed, because it tried to download deprecated version of vscode extension: https://open-vsx.org/api/ms-vscode/node-debug2/latest/
 
I searched through dap-mode repo and found this issue #554, and this comment with instructions, but they are still for the old version of the extension.
 
I tried following the steps but using the newer version of extension at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug
 
I extracted the content of .vsix file into ~/.emacs.d/.local/cache/.extension/vscode/ms-vscode.js-debug-companion
 
I think I just need to set dap-node-debug-path (pointing to that dir) and lastly, set dap-node-debug-program. And here I think where I'm failing. I'm not sure to which file in the directory to point it to.
 
 Does anyone know how to set up dap-mode debugging for node.js?

 I have been working on a summary of concurrency in the JVM (Java, Scala) and thought the following diagram might be useful for you to have as overview.
 Naturally we all leverage high level of abstraction libraries (actors, cats-effects) to be productive, but often forget the building blocks those libraries use under the hood.

 http://textfiles.com/programming/vivsemacs.txt
 ​
  
ABSTRACT: The editors vi and emacs were compared using a simple time-based experimental method involving common text manipulations and a post- test opinion survey by questionnaire. The subjects were twelve students; six were novices and six were regular users. Significant objective performance differences were confined to the novice users; here emacs consistently outperformed vi with respect to time taken to perform the tasks and the amount of help needed. Subjectively, novices preferred emacs because of its more predictable nature. Emacs was therefore the editor of choice for the novice users tested. There appears to be no advantage for a regular user of one editor to switch to the other.

 Anyway, I've been interested in FP for a while and have naturally come across the STG paper by SLP Jones from 1992. This paper cites a lot of older works, such as the spineless G-machine, the G-machine, TIM, ABC etc.
 I find it really interesting to look through these other, older abstract machines preceding the STG machine but the thing is: is there anything succeeding the STGM? Or is it truly undefeated in its design for 30 years?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to implement bijective type level function that would work like UnHKD (a :: f Int, b :: f String) (a :: Int, b :: String) in purescript.
 First approach I thought about is to define it directly over records:
 class UnHKD :: Row Type -> Row Type -> Constraint class UnHKD t t' | t -> t', t' -> t instance ( R.Cons label (f a) as' as , R.Cons label a bs' bs , UnHKD as' bs' ) => UnHKD as bs else instance UnHKD r r 
 However, it doesn't work:
 check :: Unit check = toProve -- error: type class instance for `Prim.Row.Cons t2 (t3 t4) t5 t0` is possibly infinite. where toProve :: UnHKD () () => Unit toProve = unit 
 The second approach was to use RowLists. However, type inference was lost. Probably because RowToList is not bijective:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've noticed that Emacs 29 comes with a useful function called duplicate-line that duplicates the current line. Surprisingly, it's not bound to any key by default. To make it more accessible, I decided to bind it to the key combination C-S-d (Control-Shift-d). I was able to achieve this by using the following command in my Emacs configuration:
 (keymap-global-set "C-S-d" 'duplicate-line) 
 It works but I'm not sure if it's the proper way to do this, though.

 I have a string with html content I want to propertize using html-mode so I basically do this:
 (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*temp-buffer*") (erase-buffer ) (html-mode) (insert "<html><body><h1>hi there</h1></body></html>") (buffer-substring (point-min ) (point-max))) 
 the output I receive after running this code is this:
 #("<html><body><h1>hi there</h1></body></html>" 0 43 (fontified nil)) 
 but when I go to the buffer interactively and run
 (buffer-substring (point-min ) (point-max)) 
 in eval-expression I got a html text with properties.
 what I'm missing in the non-interactive code? also if there is a better method for this please share .
 thanks in advance.

A PKM is defined as follows:
Personal knowledge management - Wikipedia
Alternative Definitions and Roles
An alternative definition for Personal Knowledge Management would be to define a PKM by its use. Looking at the definition of a Zettelkasten, we have:
Zettelkasten.de.
Using these definitions, we can conclude that there are two fundamental types of PKM:
In other words:
The PKM based on networked thoughts could be considered as an 'Active PKM'. Its purpose being the generation of emergent ideas, and
The Organisational PKM could be considered as a 'Passive PKM' for the archiving and retrieval of facts.]]></summary>

For example, if I write "example" somewhere in a document, I would like it pops up automatically when I start writing "exa". I have Corfu-global-mode corfu-pop-up mode and Corfu-history enabled.
 However, this popup suggestion works perfectly on org-mode! For any other modes, it just does not work. It would be very helpful to get it to work for other modes, especially for Latex mode and Python mode!
 Please let me know. Thanks a lot for your help.
 Here is my config for corfu: ``` (use-package corfu :custom (corfu-cycle t) ; Allows cycling through candidates (corfu-auto t) ; Enable auto completion (corfu-auto-prefix 2) (corfu-auto-delay 0.1) (corfu-popupinfo-delay '(0.4 . 0.2)) (corfu-preview-current 'insert) ; Do not preview current candidate (corfu-preselect-first nil) (corfu-on-exact-match nil) ; Don't auto expand tempel snippets
 :bind (:map corfu-map ("M-SPC" . corfu-insert-separator) ("TAB" . corfu-next) ([tab] . corfu-next) ("S-TAB" . corfu-previous) ([backtab] . corfu-previous) ("S-<return>" . nil) ;; leave my entry as it is ("RET" . corfu-insert)) :init (global-corfu-mode) (corfu-history-mode) (corfu-popupinfo-mode) ; Popup completion info )

 One of his books is called Grokking Simplicity, an introduction to Functional Programming, and I'm wondering where his formulations and definitions of functional programming are incorrect, at least from a Haskeller point of view.
 ​
 A lot of these formulations are pretty accessible; i.e, in functional programming, you have a separate notion of actions (effects), computation, and values, but I'm worried that they might not be correct in a Haskell context. Any opinions on Grokking Simplicity?

 Almost a year ago I wrote an article describing my note-taking process here (linked from the InternetArchive because I inadvertently changed/removed some stuff on my site). I got a lot of messages from people suggesting I open-source what I had worked on, so here I am.
 I don't have much any knowledge wrt submitting packages into Melpa (let alone being able to test what I've done locally), so I'm asking /r/emacs for support. Without jumping too deeply into googling myself out of my own ignorance, I found this article, but it wasn't completely helpful. So here are my main question(s):
  
How can I test that my package rolodex.el works before I submit a PR to the Melpa repo?
 What other things am I missing (README aside, I still wanna write that)?
  
Here's my code if anyone wants to take a gander: rolodex.org
 It's still early(ish) in its development, but it should work (at least the original code works in my init file), so it shouldn't be judged as complete. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am experiencing a fairly common issue using GNU Screen in conjunction with Emacs. In short, out of the box, Screen does not seem to support italic fonts when used with a standard terminal, e.g. xterm. Since lots of recent Emacs packages use italics, e.g. Marginalia, this is quite annoying. Without italics support, Screen places some ugly underlines to highlight text.
 A way to check italics support is to run chinfocmp -1 | grep -E 'ritm|sitm'. When run inside Screen, the output is empty. When run without Screen, the output is not empty. I have not found a $TERM value that uses standard termcap or terminfo database entries that fixes this issue inside Screen.
 What is your setup for running Emacs inside Screen with good italics support? Related: https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=36676

Kickstart.nvim is not a distribution.
 Kickstart.nvim is a template for your own configuration. The goal is that you can read every line of code, top-to-bottom, understand what your configuration is doing, and modify it to suit your needs.
 Once you've done that, you should start exploring, configuring and tinkering to explore Neovim!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[>>> indent-bars <<<
 There are many indentation guide packages out there, but I found most to be slow and inflexible. Plus I wanted to try out the idea of drawing vertical bars using font-lock and the :stipple face attribute.
 The result is indent-bars. Ultra-fast. Highly configurable — from barely-there to editor-flexing bling. With all the features you'd expect (all optional naturally):
  
color-blending for dialing in just the right level of glanceability vs. intrusiveness
 indentation depth-based coloring
 current depth highlighting (with zero speed cost + many possible styles)
 blank line support
  
Important note: I learned that apparently not all Emacsen properly support :stipple (despite happily accepting it as a face attribute). Linux/UNIX is safe, emacs-mac supports it on MacOS, but Windows may not at all (untested). Also, terminal emacs does not (to my knowledge) implement :stipple. Let me know how you fare.

 Does anyone know if there is any way to display them in such a "daily timeline" grid?
 SOLVED: the reason it didn't appear is due to the SCHEDULED: "property" (not really a property) added automatically by the org-schedule command. Removing it brought the tasks back to the grid.
 no \"daily timeline\" (grid)
 none of the repeated tasks display in the \"grid\"

 I have very little knowledge of emacs and what I am trying to do is to map the keysequence "C-u 1 C-c |" in orgmode to a key in evil mode.
 "C-c |" is bound to org-table-create-or-convert-from-region, so I tried this:
 (general-evil-define-key '(normal visual) org-mode-map :prefix "SPC" "t" (lambda() (interactive) (org-table-create-or-convert-from-region '(1))) ) 
 But now when I select a region and press SPC-t (which should trigger this mapping) all I get is the the error message "this should not happen" from emacs...
 I have no clue what this is supposed to mean, so my questions are:
 1) Why is this error message produced and what does it mean?
 2) What is the proper way to do the keymapping?
 Many thanks!

 Inject is available already on Maven Central, but also you can just copy-paste the source code - it's just one file.

 title says it all. I was preparing to write mail using my comfy mu4e setup (after some time of not using it) only to discover that for some reason the message body is in some non-monospaced font that nearly had my eyes bleed.
 This is news to me, I never had this happen before. How can I change this?
 Have a good day and thanks for your help :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Having encountered Haskell for the first time back in 2019, I've been developing with it and off since then and even contributing to open source projects. It's been a phenomenal, intellectually rewarding journey and it's by far my favourite programming language.
 However, I've reached a point in my Haskell journey where I feel like I should either put it on the side and learn other things, or continue with it, but on a more narrower, specialized path. 
 I know Haskell is a general purpose programming language and can be used to solve any programming problem, but so are other programming languages such as Python or C/++. 
 But I can't help but feel that since Haskell is unique, it must have a domain that it uniquely excels in. 
 What does r/haskell think this domain is? I really want to continue learning and mastering Haskell, but I need a sense of direction.
 Thanks.

 (org-heading-components) returns heading components without extracting statistics cookies such as [1/1] or [50%].
 The goal would be to cut them out of the cookie heading string (nth 4 (org-heading-components)) and save them in a separate list. What could be a good solution?
 Any ideas?

 If a function, that is written in an end recursive form (so doesn't leave any tmp variables / operations on the stack), called unto itself via ex. curry / uncurry (and friends) still end recursive as the stack frame changes into that currying function? So basically does haskell (the compiler) undestand that function as still end recursive or not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not strictly an emacs question, but I feel like emacs users are the primary users of Super key bindings. I'm forced to use a Mac for work, and primarily remote display Emacs through x2go and Xquartz. I can't figure out how to bind a key to Super. By default, option is used for Meta, but command key combos seems to send international characters to emacs rather than get recognized as a modifier. When I'm running locally on the Mac, `(setq mac-command-modifier 'super)` works, but since my remote emacs isn't running on MacOS this has no effect. As far as I can tell, Super doesn't show up in Xquartz configuration at all. Is this just a missing feature I'm going to have to live with? 
 And if you're wondering why I don't just run locally and use TRAMP, I am doing a lot of python debugging, dap-mode with debugpy is a vastly superior debugging environment to gud-pdb, and dap-mode is broken on TRAMP.

 I can access to the internet, cannot use usb slot, nor run .exe files, do not have virtual environments, is out of question I can speak now with the manager to ask to review the policies. Apart from this not positive side, I like the institution a lot from an etical point of view.

 Is this possible? What would be the pain points? Would it bring value to anyone else?
 I guess the descriotion would have to be of the kind {desc}-{last-update}, with {desc} being freely adaptable...

How to prevent GHC from inferring types with undesirable constraints by Nicolas Frisby
For a broad class of domain-specific constraints/languages, this is the first technique I’ve learned of that enables custom compile-time error messages in the particularly insidious scenario where the user’s mistake incurs polymorphism that the library author did not intend.
Lazy Layout by Jasper Van der Jeugt
Tumblr in particular has a fairly nice way to do photo sets, where these can be organised in rows and columns. I wanted to see if I could mimic this in a recursive way, where rows and columns can be subdivided further.

GHC Steering Committee seeks input from industrial Haskell users by David Christiansen

The Haskell Foundation’s Stability Working Group thinks that this can solve a real need: teams of Haskell developers will be able to more easily understand the status of extensions and express machine-checked policies for CI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some users were reporting problems when trying to set up notifications for scheduled org-mode tasks. I couldn't find many examples for doom emacs, which got me slightly concerned.
 Does anyone have any configuration or advice for choosing the right package (org-notifications, org-alert, org-wild-notifier, org-timed-alerts) for setting it up? The end goal I expected to be standard system notifications (e.g. notify-send) that you could configure to appear 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day before a scheduled event.
 UPDATE1: It appears that org-alert isn't working out of the box and requires some extra configuration - it is necessary to make org-notifications work.
 UPDATE2: seems that by default org-alert outputs to message buffer. Adding (setq alert-default-style 'libnotify) seems to have solved it.
 UPDATE3: looks it shouldn't be necessary. org-notifications should set alerting style to libnotify already when running (org-notifications-start), so adding it to (after! org... ) block should be enough (hopefully).
 UPDATE4: above doesn't work. If anyone figured it out please let me know.

 Can I make similar bindings for emacs as well? Thanks.

 https://github.com/public-law/oregon-law-parser
 It's a pure Stack setup. I've tried many techniques using ghcup, different versions of Stack and GHC... The closest I could get is all the tests passing on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, but it reinstalls GHC 8.0.2 every time it runs the tests. (!)
 If this will take more than just a minute or two, I'm happy to pay for someone's time — have tests passing so I can further develop it and use it. For a stretch goal, I'd love it to develop it easily on my Mac with VS Code — so, running on the current recommended ghcup, hls, and ghc, all on Mac silicon. 
 If this works out, I'm open to the person who gets this working again doing the new dev required — test and use it with the latest Oregon laws.
 Thanks in advance!

 I'm thinking in making something that is very composable and easy to use through do-notation, in order to achieve tasks like completion through an LLM, creating and storing embeddings, analyzing pictures and audio, etc.
 All of this abstracted in some kind of interface (MTL, Free Monad and friends, or whatever other thing)
 Given that GHC can generate Wasm and we can make mobile apps with Reflex, one could be able to use these things in any platform easily.
 Does that sound appealing? (I mean, ignoring the shit ton of absurd hype there's around ChatGPT, just focusing on the utility of a cohesive AI ecosystem in Haskell)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a 3d printed ergo-mech split keyboard and I'm toying with the idea of building a streamlined portabl monitor/pc that will let me minimize my footprint on the go with my keyboard. 
 Ideally I'd like almost a tablet like experience where I just setup a monitor and connect my keyboard (considering making a bluetooth version) and go to work for writing / notes etc in emacs. Use case would be taking a train or chilling in a cafe. 
 Currently I have a standard laptop running ubunto but have 0 use for the keyboard so the monitor just sits further away from me than I'd prefer. 
 Any ideas?

 I'd like to be able to be able to use it with WAI and a lightweight framework, like Twain, but I'm not sure how to integrate it.
 Using the Twain README snippet as an example (see below), how could I adapt the usage of ResponderM so I can instead use the Eff monad. This would allow me to use the builtin effects like Reader, etc.
 Also, is there a better way to access a reader environment? Should the environment go in the WAI Request's Vault instead of trying to use a different monad? The library moved to using vault instead of a TwainM and RouteM monad which reminded me of Scotty.
 Thanks.

It is triggered just by normal typing, on every new list, like in the schreenshot above. The same backtrace was also triggered when I opened the parameter list for the function definition, while I was typing "array" as the first parameter.
 Any idea what am I doing wrong? Do I need to enable/disable something, or is it just a bug? 
 I have built Emacs from the current git master: GNU Emacs 30.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, cairo version 1.17.8) of 2023-07-24, so I am on the edge, with other words, might be Emacs bug as well :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This release adds BigInt/BigDecimal support and a way to create zero-overhead new types.
 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library bringing type constraints to Scala. You can attach predicates to type and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive = 5 val y: Int :| Positive = -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] = -5.refineEither //Left("...") 
 Check the README for further information.
 Main changes
 Support for BigInt and BigDecimal
 All constraints in io.github.iltotore.iron.constraint.numeric except Infinity and NaN now support BigInt and BigDecimal.
 RefinedTypeOps
 You can add smart constructors to your type aliases using the RefinedTypeOps trait:
 scala type Temperature = Int :| Positive object Temperature extends RefinedTypeOps[Temperature]  scala val temperature: Temperature = Temperature(100) val maybeTemperature: Option[Temperature] = Temperature.option(100) val temperatureOrError: Either[String, Temperature] = Temperature.either(100) 
 Other changes
 You can check the full changelog on GitHub

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 I've settled on learning emacs for my creative writing, and am wondering how I can have a file of my characters open in one buffer at the part describing "Stan", and the same file in another buffer showing the part describing "Loretta" (python fans will understand the choice of names).
 I'm aware I can have different files in different buffers all displayed at once, but I don't really want my dramatis personae broken up into lots of single files. I also want to be able to add to the character descriptions as I'm writing and think of new bits about them and/or change things as I go along and come up with new ideas.
 As I've got a widescreen monitor, I want to be able to have those to one side and the story file open in the middle of my screen with my notes on location in a buffer to the other side. What I've found on YouTube has confused me as I'm failing to apply the information to what I want, and my google-fu appears to have gone down to the Crown for a pint.
 Please help this complete newbie. Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am using doom emacs for rust. When I run compilation or test (with in example rustic-cargo-test) an compilation window opens. When I then go through the errors using next-error, the next error in the compilation window is moved into view, but only its top line. Since rust errors are very descriptive and spawn multiply lines, can I somehow instruct next-error to not only move the next error into view but also move to the top of the compilation window? That way I could see the full error message.
 Thank your for any help :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, 2023-07-26, at 1000 UTC (that's less than 30 minutes from the time of this announcement!) we are streaming the 8th episode of the Haskell Unfolder live on YouTube:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7673JaWXaA&list=PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7&index=8
 Many of Haskell's abstractions come with laws; well-known examples include the Functor type class with the functor laws and the Monad type class with the monad laws, but this is not limited to type classes; for example, lenses come with a set of laws, too. To people without a mathematical background such laws may seem intimidating; how would one even start to think about proving them for our own abstractions? In this episode of The Haskell Unfolder we will discuss examples of these laws, show how to prove them, and discuss common techniques for such proofs, including induction. We will also discuss why these laws matter; what goes wrong when they do not hold?
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks.
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:
 https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder
 And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I'm wondering if anyone can please point me to any Emacs packages for generating random events and tables from Mythic Game Emulator or anything similar.
 Asking since even though random table and random name generator sites exist, it would be a nice workflow to do it in Emacs via a function that spits out the same info in an Org Mode buffer than having to have so many browser tabs open for the same effect.
 It would be even better if it could spit out random scenarios given characters that you provide etc. I know this type of idea is borderline CharGPT but it would be way less daunting and more fun to just have something do this for you for solo players.
 ​
 Thanks!

To me, the problem is that ultimately accuracy still needed to be evaluated by "professional annotators".
I don't know yet what to make of it.
However, I am trying to keep track of AI as a most likely assistant in a literal sense. I am very suspicious:
Manfred Spitzer compares the effect of an ox and a tractor on work performance and health.[62/63][#spitzer2012]
If you harness an ox to the plough, you still have to work hard. You have to walk, steer the plough and so on.
If you hitch a tractor to the plough, you don't have to work at all, you just sit and don't exert yourself physically.
So we can distinguish two ways in which we increase our performance:
we increase the effectiveness of our efforts.
we replace our efforts with the efforts of others.]]></summary>

 ​
 I found Orgzly while looking for an organizer / agenda for my android phone, and it became essential in my everyday routine.
 Sadly, there isn't too much info available on the subject, let alone in spanish.
 So here is a question: I haven't been able to make a notification to work in advance, e.g.: if I set the time for a task at 10 hrs., and the "delay" with a value of -1h, I understand it should trigger a notification at 9, but never did.
 Maybe thers some configuration in my new phone I'm not activating (Pixel 6) or in the app preferences.
 Any help would be appreciated.
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After finding org-roam-ui, I was interested in how that package created a webpage that displayed information from, and interacted with emacs. From what I can tell, org-roam-ui uses simple-httpd and websocket.el to create a webserver which is used to transfer information between the page and emacs. 
 I wanted to see whether I could use that general idea to create a dashboard/launch page for emacs. Ideally, I would be able to make a page which could display my org agenda/calendar in real time, give me buttons for a few commands, display information from my ledger file, and let me search my org and roam directories. 
 I don't have a very good understanding of how this works however, and my limited grasp took me just far enough to create a webpage, start the webserver in emacs, and access the page. I had wanted to start small (maybe a button that runs some arbitrary command or displays a message in emacs) but I don't even know where to start with that. 
 I was wondering whether anyone had any specific resources that might help, or advice as to how I might tackle this? I'm reading more into how webservers work on my own but I'm a little lost.
 Any help would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I discovered that both spacemacs and purcell emacs starter kits out of the box turn on desktop-save-mode. This means that emacs tries to save its state, and recover it on start up. This does not work reliably at present in Android emacs: Android may terminate emacs at any moment, and that may leave an inconsistent saved state.
 Until someone comes up with a solution for this, it is important to disable desktop-save-mode. So add the following to the user (local) part of the start-up file(s):
 (desktop-save-mode -1)
 In spacemacs that is in ~/.spacemacs dotspacemacs/user-config()
 In purcell that is in ~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-local.el
 The emacs variable desktop-save-mode should then be nil after startup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi when I try to recall later entries from my kill-ring with yank-pop I have this weird behaviour where I have to call yank-pop three times to get further back in the kill-ring. If say I have this in my scratch buffer
 (setq kill-ring nil) ; nil (evaluated) 1. First Item 2. Second Item 3. Third Item 
 And then kill each line one by one with C-k when I look at my kill-ring with browse-kill-ring I have the expected:
 3. Third Item ------- 2. Second Item ------- 1. First Item 
 But then if I yank with C-y I get back 3. Third Item but now my kill-ring looks like:
 3. Third Item ------- 3. Third Item ------- 2. Second Item ------- 1. First Item 
 And so when I then immediately call yank-pop with M-y , instead of getting 2. Second Item I again just see the third item, and I always need to call yank-pop three times to actually start getting back into the kill-ring.
 I am running fairly vanilla Emacs, with no packages shadowing the yank/kill commands. Could anyone help explain why this happens, or anything I should look into to change so that I get what I imagine should be the expected behaviour where C-y gives me the third item, but then M-y should replace that with the second item and one more M-y would give me the first?
 Thanks a lot for any help / suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example, lazy evaluation makes debugging different from eager evaluated languages. At some specific points of a program, many expressions maybe partially evaluated. I suspect there should be something like call stack for function, but for partially evaluated expressions.
 Hence there should be some improvement to everyday's debugger. But I'm not familiar with this. 
 If you have anything in mind, please bring it up here. It's not necessarily exclusive to Haskell though. Thanks. :)

 my example
 do hPutStr handle =<< getLine

 do msg <- getLine hPutStr handle msg 
 If there is no speed difference which do yall think is more readable?
 Obviously, the second one is more readable for a novice but I do like the look of just binding `getLine` to `hPutStr handle`.
 EDIT: There is more code after this, it is not just this line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 my team is currently at a crossroad. We've been building a couple of services over the years using the Play framework. Maybe it wasn't the best choice back then, since we really only have an http (mostly) REST backend server, but coming from a Java background, that seemed like a good one-stop-shop.
 Now, given the current maintenance state of the framework, plus the fact that a few other teams have moved to spring-based solutions, we are evaluating where to move next.
 The first choice would be to use Akka-HTTP directly (despite the price), but then that would still require us to rethink:
  
DI framework (guice for play) and service lifecycle - do we need that?
 Actions and action composition - filtering and refining requests
 String translation
 Routes generation - we really liked how easy was to find routes information in play with routes files
  
I played a bit with http4s and tapir, and loved how clean the functional interfaces are, but my colleagues and managers are arguing that "it is not widely used and we just wanna use frameworks/libraries that have good/active support".
 I did some research, and despite seeing that most of the libraries mentioned across the website have frequent-enough updates, I'm not sure which ones are more "reliable" on long term.
 Also, if anyone has any insight, or faced similar problems before, how did you get a resolution?
 Thank you all!

 I want to be able to open URLs from within my text files, by using the function M-x browse-url.
 Unfortunately I can't seem to make it work, i am getting the error,
 "No suitable browser for URL" 
 I've tried a bunch of things I've found on the web, but nothing seems to work.
 some of the things i've tried include:
 (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-default-windows-browser) (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-generic browse-url-generic-program "start chrome") (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-generic browse-url-generic-program "C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe") (setq browse-url-firefox-program "C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe") (setq browse-url-chrome-program "C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe") (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-firefox) 
 i didn't try everything together of course!
 ​
 Any ideas what I am doing wrong here?

 This error is repeated several times in the *Messages* buffer.

 (setq treesit-font-lock-level 4))
 I have installed all grammar (without any errors) in ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter using treesit-install-language-grammar. I have also checked that c++-ts-mode is the major mode in the buffer. Do I need to set anything else to get this to work?

Now, whenever I change my config it shows up in real time on the website.
 I'm still working on adding to it, but please check out the exported source. I'd love to share more about how I did this for anyone interested.

 I was able to clean up the code for the most part, with some minor modifications, but I'm not able to figure out what was going on in the uniqueLetters = unique string line. I can, of course, define string but that shadows the earlier use of the variable. Is this just an error, or some historically supported hack, or am I misreading the original?

 I tried
 (define-key global-map (kbd "<tab-bar> S-<down-mouse-1>") 'ignore) (define-key global-map (kbd "<tab-bar> S-<mouse-1>") 'ignore) 
 and the same with "nil" instead of "'ignore", and for C instead of S.

 Is there a way with advices to do something before the return function gets evaluated? From my understanding using filter-return would give me (find-file file) return value after it gets executed, I'd like to do something before it's evaluated (i.e. before it visits the file and creates the new buffer).
 Not sure if advices can help here or it would be better to just redefine the whole function.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My name is Paribanú Freitas. I am a psychologist and university professor in my country, Uruguay. I am currently doing my doctoral thesis in "social studies" and I came to the zettelkasten method by different youtube content creators.
Through my work I have always been interested in the worlds of productivity and the articulation between educational processes and difficult resources of intellectual work. In fact, a few years ago I have been blogging on this last subject, although I do not publish very much on it: www.tdg.hypotheses.org .
Clearly for those of us who are knowledge workers at different levels (and especially if that knowledge is academic knowledge) I believe the zettelkasten method is really essential and definitive. Luhmann's productivity clearly demonstrates it and I do not understand how the teaching of the method in depth and in a practical way is not part of the educational grids at the university level.
Currently, along with researching and implementing the method in order to support my doctoral research, I am thinking of opening an extracurricular and open course at my university on digital tools for intellectual work, study and writing techniques, time organization resources and other skills and technologies to be "taught" by Twitch. There are already many students who have shown interest in the proposal and I love that it's on Twitch since I think I'm a bit of a geek despite my age.
Finally, this semester I have also created a discord community (in Spanish) for postgraduate students from Latin America. If anyone is interested, I leave the link in case it works: https://discord.gg/c7CX6TVExH
I'm glad I found this community and I'll be participating in it frequently for sure. Thank you so much!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always thought of integrating both together, yet with no success. org-roam usually has many files, which tends to make org-agenda much slower. I've been using task management paradigms to fulfill the missing context of the tasks in the agenda. Until I found this article recently Task management with org-roam Vol. 5: Dynamic and fast agenda which was really helpful. Ironically, I had seen it even before but i didn't give it much attention because I assumed it will be deadly slow. After applying it, my agenda has become a little bit slower, but it was just fine. After this, I learned that using org-ql for the agenda (instead of org search) makes it faster up to 5 times, and there is cache support. Now the agenda loading speed is no longer a problem, and each task has full context and relation tags to its categories.
