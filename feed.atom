Question 1: So if I do something like this

 Do I really want to put this is in the same file MyVariable is made? Wouldn't I only want this instance in the testfile?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, i am learning how to build applications with tagless final pattern. However, I am a bit confused at the moment, that which tagless final approach is the right one. I know there are tons of resources out there which states that in tagless final pattern, we use trait as the algebra with a companion object. Most of the times, developers tend to do the implementations in the companion object as well, or create another class (interpreter) where they implement the algebra's functions. However, I have seen many solutions where the devs replace the trait + companion object combo with class + companion object one. 
 Honestly, I am pretty confused which approach is the right one: 
 // 1. trait + companion object approach trait Repository[F[_]] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] } object Repository { def apply[F[_]]()(implicit ev: Repository[F]): Repository[F] = ev def make[F[_]](): Repository[F] = new Repository[F] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] = ... } } // 2. class + companion object approach class Repository[F[_]]() { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] = ... } object Repository { def apply[F[_]](): Repository[F] = new Repository[F]() }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to use an ECS system in Haskell and I have found apecs and ecstasy. However, both seem to use IntMap for storing component data, so I figured that performance could not be all that great.
 That's why I created a new library, hero, which uses sparse sets for storing component data. Basic benchmarks seem to suggest that hero is roughly 40 times faster than apecs at iterating over components.
 The interface for hero is inspired by apecs, but there are some significant differences.
 The library is still rough around the edges, but you can already find it on https://github.com/Simre1/hero. I have also started work on an sdl2 binding which is in the same repository.
 The end goal for hero is to empower people to make simple games in Haskell, but there is still a long way to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
My professor has shared many cool worksheets and spreadsheets for organizing literature notes for use in my lit reviews. (Thank you, amazing professor!!) However, as I was going through the examples, I found myself thinking, "hey, couldn't I just do this via zettels?"
Here's my thinking: Each worksheet or spreadsheet uses a one-line per article approach. For each article, the worksheet provides space to capture the following:
Authors (year)
Relevant Literature & Theory (Major Points, Topics, Ideas, and Who was referenced?)
Purpose of the study
Overview of Study Design (Method, Variables/Key Concepts, Sample - who was studied and how were they selected, Means of Data Collection?)
Major Finding(s)
Conclusions, Implications, & Limitations
Now, here's how I currently structure my zettels:

I include the citation in the title
I include a "too long, don't read" summary at the top
I write a more expansive entry
I include my own tags for cross-referencing
I include related card links
I include the actual reference
In theory, it should be pretty easy to establish a new template where the top part becomes spots for those worksheet areas. The bottom part would largely remain the same, only the tags would allow me to include things like
Which lit review this is for (creativity & spirituality, agency & organizational transformation, or if it speaks to both)
Findings tags and research method tags (e.g., #creativity-spirituality; #quantitative #survey)
My own brilliant insights and connections
Et cetera.
My questions for this community are:
Thanks in advance for your help with this one!

 How can I customize it so that the error message doesn't break like so?
 Sorry for the noob question, I tried to figure it out and read the documentation provided, but could not do it.
 SOLUTION:
 The issue with wrapping lines is caused when using a fixed font, so removing the value set to font face height solved the issue for me.
 Another thing I tried was changing the font to a non-mono-spaced one, but I decided to stick with the first one.

 I'm converting my bash and zsh configs to a literate org file and finding noweb quite confusing. I think I understand everything in the manual, but my changes keep breaking it.
 In this commit, all I've done is move two blocks from one noweb-ref to another (previously they inherited their noweb-refs from the subtree properties). This was intended just to clean up the org file without changing the output.
 The tangled shell scripts and zsh.toml haven't changed. But bash.toml (which I didn't touch at all!) now includes the #+begin_src and #+end lines of the :noweb-ref prompt-format block.
 I'd be really grateful if anyone could have a look at the diff and let me know where I've gone wrong:
 https://github.com/quarkQuark/dotfiles/commit/82551520806ad2e9c2b22e3bc4446c5352ce14c2
 I've also noticed that sometimes replacing a :noweb-ref header argument with an equivalent #+name makes every noweb reference in the org file expand to the empty string. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for when this happens, but going back to :noweb-ref always fixes it.
 Thanks in advance for any replies.

So I started reading about html, css and javascript, and I tinkered a little with Phaser.js and created very very simple game with it. I also tried wordpress, ihp and django. I also looked at purescript and halogen as was suggested to me on r/haskell three weeks ago. With none of those I spent more than 2 or 3 days though, so I do not really know much about any of these technologies. I just got my pinky a little wet.

 I'm using Arch Linux and every time I compile, I have to open the PDF with Brave.

 Truthfully Google Calendar never really made me feel any better when it came to calendaring anyways. I was always in that place of add an event for my days off and deal with the conflicts when I schedule something for said day off... or add every day that I work and delete the days off....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi - I installed Scala via `cs` (Coursier) installer. Java version is "1.8.0_341" and it is in the path.
 Checking `sbt` version shows "1.7.1" and `scala` version is "3.1.3".
 I tried to test it with basic project but sbt new scala/scala3.g8 (in empty folder) starts from fetching "getting org.scala-sbt sbt 1.3.4" - why? I already have "1.7.1".
 Then it fails due to access denial:
 [error] [launcher] java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException: C:\Users\tom_n\AppData\Local\Coursier\cache\v1\https\repo1.maven.org\maven2\com\swoval\file-tree-views\2.1.3\file-tree-views-2.1.3.jar -> C:\Users\tom_n\.sbt\boot\scala-2.12.10\org.scala-sbt\sbt\1.3.4\file-tree-views-2.1.3.jar
 [error] [launcher] could not retrieve sbt 1.3.4
 PS. I had older version of `scala` and `sbt` installed before but I uninstalled them - could it be that there are some artifacts left?

 hs {-# INLINE vecNLE #-} vecNLE :: DoubleX24# -> Double# -> Int# vecNLE (# v0, v1, v2, v3 #) f = ((v00 >## f) `andI#` (v01 >## f) `andI#` (v10 >## f) `andI#` (v11 >## f) `andI#` (v20 >## f) `andI#` (v21 >## f) `andI#` (v30 >## f) `andI#` (v31 >## f)) where !(# v00, v01 #) = unpackDoubleX2# v0 !(# v10, v11 #) = unpackDoubleX2# v1 !(# v20, v21 #) = unpackDoubleX2# v2 !(# v30, v31 #) = unpackDoubleX2# v3 
 which, in my eye, is quite ridiculous. Why are the code made like this? Is this obfuscation required to make haskell as performant? Or is the entire benchmarkgame itself full of these kind of code? If the latter is true, I wonder whether benchmarkgame is credible for anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I write Haskell as a hobby. I am still learning and some concepts are still very hard to understand for me. Since I mostly write Javascript for my day job, I recently got into a very interesting problem. I had to write some logic in where as set of data has to be checked through multiple other datasets and return a value or null at the end.
 When I thought this through in imperative way, I found that I have to write a massive set of if-else logic which might end-up being an "if-else hell" and quite unmanageable to in future. Since I knew I can chain a Maybe monad through multiple function using bind operator in Haskell. I ended up implementing something like this in JS. Here is the Maybe monad implementation 
 class Maybe { __value; constructor(value) { this.__value = value; } static from(value) { return new Maybe(value); } isNothing() { return ( this.__value === null || this.__value === undefined || this.__value === false ); } just() { return this.__value; } do(f) { if (this.isNothing()) { return Maybe.from(null); } return Maybe.from(f(this.__value)); } 
 }
 With the help of this I can do something like this --
 Maybe.from(1) .do(prevValue => prevValue === 1 ? prevValue + 5 : null) //return Maybe 6 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 5 ? prevValue * 2 : null) //return Maybe 12 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 10 ? prevValue + 30 : null) // return Maybe 42 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 100 ? prevValue + 5 : null) // return Maybe null .do(prevValue => prevValue < 100 ? prevValue + 50 : prevValue * prevValue) // will do nothing here .just() // return null since failed on 4th step 
 Is my understanding of Maybe monad implementation correct? How similar it is considered to Haskell's implementation of Maybe monad?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am struggling to specify org-capture-template to insert a template at a current location in the current buffer. This template will be inserted in multiple files, so I cannot specify the file name explicitly.
 This is a plain text template, there is no substitution, or anything else. I just want to insert a heading with a checklist.
 My current definition is (after some Googling)
 ("m" "Miller Heimann checklist" entry (file+function buffer-name (lambda () (goto-char (point)))) (file "~/org/miller-heimann-checklist-template.txt") :immediate-finish t :prepend t :empty-lines 1) 
 This works, sort-off:
  
If point is in the middle of a headline line, a new child node is inserted as expected.
 If the point is on a blank line or on a text line anywhere in the file, a child node is inserted as the first node in the file
  
Before I go off to single-step through the code, has anyone here faced a similar problem?
 I found one post with examples of org-capture tempaltes, but none of them matched what I am looking for. They all had specific file names as targets. 
 It makes me wonder whether I am misusing org-capture-templates. My other option is to create a plain elisp file that will insert text.
 Thanks,

 Is this because my OpenJDK is installed in my library on mac and the file I am running, called Hello world.scala is located in my icloud drive folder (under user as root)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yeah, didn't expect it to be honest. 
 Did a tech assignment, which I think I did well, but had a tech interview and afterwards they decided they didn't want to continue with me.
 It feels that they were looking for someone with a lot of FP knowledge (which I don't have that much, I understand the concepts, but where I work in currently it's not that much FP), even though that didn't really reflect from the job posting.
 I feel sad, I thought it was a pretty good fit and I put quite some time in the assignment. I prefer to learn on the job as well, that works the best for me
 Do you get rejected too for scala jobs? Any tips on how to move on from this?

I tried tutorial at: tutorial it suggests installing via `cabal install criterion` - that worked fine but I could not run the Fibonacci example (saved as Fibber.hs) via `ghc -O --make Fibber`. The complaint was about non-existent module `Criterion.Main`. I ended up copying `.cabal` file from GitHub and running `cabal build fibber` (which basically build and installe `criterion` once again) and then `cabal run Fibber -- --output fibber.html`.
 So it worked with `cabal` but why did `ghc` fail. What am doing wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[G'day guys,
 As per the title, whop would like me to start making a weekly group study session and post on here for the purpose of learning Haskell. I am studying this wonderful language at Uni (Australian National University) and am really enjoying the content so far.
 I think a resource like this will be really good for the Haskell community.
 The book is made up of 21 Chapters and has many exercises and practice problems for each of them. Each chapter will cover off on a Haskell concept and then build upon that knowledge.
 I have made a Discord for this and this invite link is: https://discord.gg/2u7GBeZe
 There is a poll for those of you who are interested in this.
 The group posts and "classes will start next week". As I am also a "beginner" in the world of Haskell it will be a learning experience for all of us but I am sure that we will have fun. As the book is 21 chapters long, I suspect that this group learning activity will take 21 weeks!
 For those of you who cannot find a copy of this book, the third edition can be easily found on Libgen. Feel free to PM me for a download link to it :)
 ​
 The .hs files for each chapter can be found here: https://www.haskellcraft.com/craft3e/Home.html

 I have a file with a scala 3 macro that runs through a package object somewhere and outputs a list of all the objects of a certain type. If this file isn't recompiled any time the program changes, this list becomes stale, and that causes problems. I can't figure out how to do this besides literally writing a timestamp to the file in a pre-build task every time so that the file has a modification to it, but there has to be a better way than this, right?

 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am learning Scala after C++ and Rust.
 I was writing a module to parse some made-up binary opcodes into appropriate case classes implementing some common ancestor class: 
 sealed abstract class Instruction object Instruction { case class Add(t: Type, source: Register, destination: Register) extends Instruction ... } 
 I came up with a solution including a list of Int => Function tuples: (2)
 val handlers = List( (OPCODE_NOP, (_,_,_) => Instruction = Instruction.Nop(_, _, _), .. ) 
 The above code is approximate. The original solution was: (3)
  (OPCODE_NOP, Instruction.Nop) 
 But it turns out the second element of the tuple becomes Instruction.Nop.type, instead of a function as I would expect. My question is why is it so and is there a way to shorten the function (2) with placeholders to something similar to the last code block (3) ?
 -----
 Side note: implementors of Instruction have different argument sets, so currently I split them into multiple groups based on argument sets and handle them using LUTs:
 val handlers_type_reg_reg = List( (OP1, OP1_constructor), .. ) val handlers_type_reg = List( (OP2, OP2_constructor), .. ) val handler_types = List( (OP1, handler_type_reg_reg), (OP2, handler_type_reg), ..) 
 So the top-level function would choose a specific function for a group of instructions based on an argument set and call it, the specific function would look up the constructor for the specific instruction and call it.
 Does it look sane or am I missing some beautiful FP / Scala expressiveness?:)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Core Strats at Standard Chartered Bank are hiring Haskell developers again. We're currently looking for three developers, and we're flexible with regards to seniority / experience.
 The head of our group has given a talk at the Haskell Implementer’s Workshop last year where he described the team and what we do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A70SN7vFsKU
 These roles are specifically for Applications & Services development, so expect some GUI work and plenty of stakeholder interaction.
 Applications should go via these links:
 Warsaw: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2200023433 for direct employment, or [CoreStratsRoles@sc.com](mailto:CoreStratsRoles@sc.com) for contracting
 London: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2200023448
 Singapore: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2200017272
 Shanghai: reach out to [CoreStratsRoles@sc.com](mailto:CoreStratsRoles@sc.com)
 The Warsaw position is open to both contractors and direct employment, whereas the others are only open for direct employment. Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll, and after an initial 3-month in-office period. We cover visa and relocation costs for successful employment applicants.

I am Carlos and I live in Spain. I discovered this website recently and it immediately caught my attention, so I decided to join, because I've been thinking about creating a Zettelkasten system for some time and I found it one of the best sites I've seen to learn, with quite deep knowledge about the system from both Luhmann's and Ahrens' interpretations.
So that's it. I hope to learn a lot and actually starting to build my Zettelkasten.

 I scrolled through documentation in the wiki and I thought that I had a problem with Image magick, so I installed, but as you have read, It tries to read to executable from a release of Xorg that is 26 years old.
 I'm a little lost here, I've scrolled through all the posts with "thumb" in various forums a good part of them mostly apply to compile time shenanigans (ruled out because I can see images with dired and pressing 'v' or Windows with the image magick support (and I'm on Debian). Thanks.

 So here it comes:
 Whenever I invoke elfeed (M-x elfeed) it opens both a search buffer (*elfeed-search*) and the elfeed.org file I'm using to list my feeds. This means that, once I've exited the elfeed-search buffer, I see the elfeed.org file there. Is there a way to prevent this file from opening in a buffer (preferably) or to close it automagically when the *elfeed-search* buffer is closed?
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

 I initialized a project nodew/haskell-dapr (github.com) to bring dapr to Haskell world. And I believe it will make Haskell more productive on web development.
 Since Haskell doesn't have good GRPC support today, so currently, I just implemented the HTTP client APIs. 
 You can contribute the project by:
  
Add more tests
 Add Server module
 Create a sample app
 GRPC integration
 Simplify the APIs
  
I'm not good at writing tests in Haskell, especially testing against such a complex system. Your suggestion will be a great help to me and this project, of course, PRs would be much better!
 Thanks again!

 I had the idea that yearly would be a better option, letting me see all of the headlines for a given year. But there isn't a timestamp for the entries. Each new date gets an entry but no timestamp within the day. Is this by design?
 Okay, so I can just hit a key combo and let emacs put in a timestamp for me. It doesn't work. C-c . just inserts the date, no time. C-u C-c . also just inserts the date, no time.
 Anyone with ideas on how I can have my journal entries timestamped, short of me looking at a clock and entering it by hand?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A struggle that I often have writing prose in Org-mode (or in any text editor with a markup language) is when I need to review things.
 I like to review from a printed copy, I'm better at catching errors that way. I also enjoy the ritual of getting off of my computer, sitting on a desk with printed pages, a red pen, and a cup of coffee.
 For that, I'll export as latex-pdf or odt and print---no big deal. The problem is that when I go back to the computer to make the changes in the file, the positions of the words and sentences are naturally very different from the ones in the printed page. So I have to be constantly switching my view from two texts that are very differently formatted, and that is tiresome. So much so, that I will often make the changes in the odt file on Libreoffice Writer, losing my god-given editing shortcuts, and once they are all done, I'll copy the text and paste it back on my org file. But then I have to be careful with italics and other stuff that will change once I copy the text in the odt and paste it on org. If all I'm doing is writing some informal text, no biggie. But when on an academic writing, messing with footnotes I'd be playing with fire to work in that way. So I end up writing a lot of my academic writer in Writer instead of Emacs.
 The obvious easy solution would be to get used to review from screen, directly in the org file. But that wouldn't help whenever I have other people's review of my text, like advisors and other professors (and a lot of them will require something compatible to MS-Word anyway, for them to use track changes).
 So... any technical solutions of different workflows that I haven't considered? How do you deal with that?

 TL;DR:
 So, maybe stack is communicating with some servers, downloading package metadata. (Like Apache Maven downloading .pom files.) It's being silent that makes me worry.

 I managed to capture it in the moment being drawn (see picture). A fracture of a second later, all the headings will look like "Szenen allgemein". But this is redundant, I would prefer Emacs not to have to draw everything twice.
 I have custom-set the faces of the headings a little bit bigger and set them to Source Sans Pro font. The colors come from the theme doom-solarized-light. I use org-superstars to change the looking of the stars, but even if I didn't, why are there two stars drawn at first, with org-hide-leading-stars set to t?
 If I add +pretty to the doom module list, this behaviour is gone (although it should only load org-appear and org-fancy-priorities), but then there is some bug, everything gets extremely slow, taking five seconds to load a 1.3M-file and 1-2 seconds to open a header. I don't need org-appear and org-fancy-priorities, so I prefer the setting without the +pretty module.
 Any ideas why the buffer is drawn twice and how I can omit that?

The powerful type system and other facilities provided by Haskell are believed to provide significant advantages in reducing defects and minimizing debugging. But there's a steep learning curve to get to the point you can take advantage of all of that. Are there any studies or data supporting the notion that benefits are worth the costs? Do we see fewer defects, less time debugging, etc? Just curious.

 I can open each file manually and run my macro which is fine. The problem is that I have thousands of them. Here is where I am lost.
 How do I run my macro on every file with a specific extension and then save the result with the same filename but as a .txt?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 3 of trying to do something with Haskell and I just spent 45 minutes arguing with the compiler for refusing to take String over Text as the argument for a Bloodhound function. Now debugging arcane Polysemy messages for hours while getting very little actual work done. I don't know if the proposed benefits will ever actually come (or whether I can get most or all with an easier language) but so far it's really fucking hard. I don't see much in terms of "beginner friendly" documentation, either - almost all the docs is in the form of "example code" (is that the cultural norm in Haskell?), which presumes a fair amount of preexisting Haskell knowledge, depending on what the example actually looks like.
 Rant over.

 - editing the proof in a separate window similar to how org-src--edit-element does it
 - changing how the table is exported
 - displaying special overlays within that table 
 - allowing LaTeX-previews of the proof.
 I know this is a bunch of different features, so I need to start adjusting at a very basic level. What seems to be a good idea is to define a new org-element ndproof which allows for just that. Does anyone of you have any experience in how to approach this, or whether this even makes any sense?

 (set-face-attribute 'org-indent nil :inherit '(org-hide fixed-pitch)) (set-face-attribute 'org-document-title nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'org-document-info nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'org-document-info-keyword nil :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch) 
 The front matter now displays using a fixed pitch font which is what I want but the indentation is still messed up. It looks like so:
 #+title: Document #+author: Author name #+date: [2022-08-27 Sat 12:50] 
 I would like the indentation in the front matter to be fixed as well. The document, author name, and date don't line up.

 I have a space leak in a quite simple conduit, where I don't understand why this leaks. See the link for a more detailed wiki page about it with pictures of the heap profiles and the output of eventlog2html.
 Basically, this is the end of a conduit pipeline, which reads from a network socket, parses packets with attoparsec and passes it to this conduit, which assigns a number to the packet, gets some fields (integral values) out of the header of the packet, formats this into a Text value as CSV and writes it to a file handle. 
 See here: https://github.com/oswald2/AURIS/wiki/space_leak
 Can somebody explain to me, why that leaks and how to fix it? I am staring at this now for some hours and feel really stupid...

 As I understand buffer-file-truename should be using abbrev-file-alist via abbreviate-file-name function to do this.
 I've narrowed my issue down to this function not abbreviating urls.
 ​
 abbrev-file-alist value:
 (("\\`'/Users/username/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive" . "/Users/username/OneDrive"))
 Function:
 (abbreviate-file-name "/Users/username/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive")

 I’m happy to announce the first release of the library hegg-0.1 on hackage: hegg: Fast equality saturation in Haskell 12 !
 hegg
 stands for haskell e-graphs good, and it’s a library featuring e-graphs (a data structure that efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions) and a high level API for equality saturation (an optimization/term-rewriting technique)
 It is a pure haskell implementation found on two recent awesome papers: egg: Fast and Extensible Equality Saturation 3 (2020) and Relational E-matching 2 (2021).
 I’d love to see what you might come up with leveraging e-graphs and equality saturation (there’s a world of applications – check out the papers and other resources), so do let me know about your efforts and how the library could be improved.
 I’ve spent a long while optimizing and making the e-graphs and equality saturation considerably performant. So we are already pretty fast! (according to my symbolic rewriting tests). I’d love to see more involved use cases, because I still see many opportunities for improving performance, and would love to take them when justified by bigger numbers and applications!
 I’ll be happy to clarify anything,
 Thank you,
 Rodrigo

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read a lot of tutorials for monads and applicative functors but for some reason it's just not clicking. I understand specific use cases, but I'm having trouble gaining a general intuition of what monads and applicative functors do. For example Typeclassopedia says "the structure of a Applicative computation is fixed, whereas the structure of a Monad computation can change based on intermediate results". By "structure of computation", do they mean that it behaves similar to an if-else statement? Like if b from (a -> m b) is 5, then do x, otherwise do y.
 What I took away from Graham Hutton's video on applicative functors was that they basically are an extension of fmap but for multiple arguments. This made sense, until I thought about the List applicative. pure (+) <*> [1, 2, 3] <*> [1, 2, 3] equals [2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6], which makes the "multiple arguments" angle confusing. I know that applicative functors can "embedded" functions into context, and that's why the result of the List applicative was so, because of how it models nondeterminism. But idk it just hasn't "clicked" for me yet.
 I was wondering someone could explain the intuition behind monads and applicative functors. Thank you in advanced!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is an Applicative instance for all the polynomial functors except Sum. Not because no instance is possible but because too many instances are possible. When lifting over different constructors we need to choose how to map one to the other, and which to map.
 Abstracting with Applicatives gives the approach of using an applicative morphism, something that preserves the applicative operations (here idiom) to mediate between between InL and InR. This is the approach used by my idiomatic package.
 instance Natural f g => Applicative (Sum f g) where pure :: a -> Sum f g a pure x = InL (pure x) liftA2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> (Sum f g a -> Sum f g b -> Sum f g c) liftA2 (·) (InL as) (InL bs) = InL do liftA2 (·) as bs liftA2 (·) (InR as) (InR bs) = InR do liftA2 (·) as bs -- these are interesting liftA2 (·) (InL as) (InR bs) = InR do liftA2 (·) (idiom as) bs liftA2 (·) (InR as) (InL bs) = InR do liftA2 (·) as (idiom bs) -- Applicative morphism type Idiom :: (Type -> Type) -> (Type -> Type) -> Constraint class (Applicative f, Applicative g) => Idiom f g where idiom :: f ~> g 
  
Can all Applicative sum types be deconstructed in this way
 Specifically can the Free f Monad
 What would you call this approach and does it appear in the literature

 I am trying literate programming and in my attempts to reference a source code block A from source code block B I get the following behavior which is not what i need.
 Is my approach wrong or am I missing something?
 org-version: 9.5.2; emacs-version: 28.1; distribution: spacemacs
 #+name: A #+begin_src js () => { console.log('hello world') } #+end_src #+name: B #+begin_src js :noweb yes let fn = <<A>> #+end_src should the outcome of the expansion be? let fn = () => { console.log('hello world') } Instead I get: let fn = () => { let fn = console.log('hello world') let fn = } 
 I found this article in stack overflow which is very similar if not the same problem I am having; but does not help since it attributes the problem to an old org-mode version.
 Cheers,
 pnoul

 Edit: Taking the suggestion from u/sjrd, I can remove the cast and it compiles but I am still seeing compile errors highlighted in my IDE. They don't arise when actually compiling though. This makes me feel like there has to be a more idiomatic approach.

But there is one issue that worries me: I noticed – more than once – that some files lose their content and do have the content of other files. It happens on saving, I surmise, but I cannot confirm that yet, because so far I have always recognized it later only. Then I wonder why the filename and the title do not match anymore. Luckily, I use git and commit my whole zettelkasten daily, so it's easy to revert. Still, it's disquieting somehow and should be fixed, I guess.

New here! Been lurking for a bit, been making notes a lot longer. Super quick rundown, as it might be relevant to my question (feel free to skip and jump to the bold sections to tl;dr it):
I've carried a small pocket notebook on me for as long as I can remember, using a numbering convention of XXX.YY.ZZ where X is the "volume" number, Y is the page, and Z is the entry on the page, e.g., 092.04.01
I previously used Standard Notes, creating "discrete" markdown notes that basically just lived on their own (SN can't link); had probably 2 or 3k notes at this point just using that analog numbering system in digital form. My biggest issue, which is now obvious, was the "set it and forget" it nature of unlinked notes, making it a "stale" system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am learning Haskell as a Scala/ZIO developer. I just read https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/exceptions/ while trying to understand why Haskell effects such as Polysemy and RIO don't have a typed error channel (as in ZIO). In particular, this quote:
  
There is no indication at the type level if something throws an exception. You should assume that, unless explicitly documented otherwise, all actions may throw an exception.
  
Meaning, every time I call any `IO`, I can expect an exception, meaning every time I need to use something like `tryIO` and handle the exception. Doesn't that cause a lot of boilerplate? If you have to try every piece of code doesn't it look really defensive? In ZIO you just have to make sure the error channel has the correct type when composing effects, but it will handle short-circuiting for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past year, I've been working with Scala on different projects. It's a core tool at my job(for doing Kafka especially), but it was never my favorite; with my background in Python and Go mostly, I did not have a hard time learning enough Scala to write code for Spark and Kafka projects. Specifically, with a lot of example code around the web, it's really easy to find what you are looking for.
 Now I feel like I'm not writing actual good Scala code but a code that only compiles; I only borrow patterns and things I know from other languages, and I think my code is not good quality code, so I'm putting time into learning it seriously, so next time we are writing an application I can make good suggestions about the architecture.
 I'm going to start with the book."Hands-on Scala Programming" I like that it's project-based, so I'll see some enough other than the syntax itself.

 Using Gnus to handle my emails I use nnmail-split-methods to sort my mail into groups, and I also have nnmail-crosspost t so that I get threads that include my sent messages (at least on Google servers). The trouble I have is that there are some auto-emails generated by an external watcher system that writes to an address that I already hav ematching another group. Because cross-posting is enabled, it gets filed in BOTH the group I have just for those emails, and also in my other primary group for that address.
 What I want is a rule that says: "Split to my TO: GROUP UNLESS from the certain address" (ie don't duplicate those particular ones). Does anyone know how to do this?

 Also, because Latex assumes periods after Upper case letters *not* to be sentence-ending, you have to use '\@' when it actually is. ("I like words that start with the letter Z." would become "I like words that start with the letter Z\@."
 Are there equivalents for those in Org mode for when exporting to pdf?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a generic library for wrapping some FFI-code neatly.
 The FFI-functions rely on an external context type that can be generated from a configuration type. Essentially, all but initial configuration functions take a pointer to the context as one of their arguments. As part of memory management, I wrap this pointer with finalizers and a reference counter in a newtype that is intended to be pretty opaque to the user. 
 Since I want this library to be polymorphic for different codes wrapped in the same manner, I want to create a typeclass
  class Context c where type RawContext c --type of unwrapped context type RawConfig c --type of unwrapped config 
 With methods that map directly to the utility functions in the FFI-code, and some other instance specific functions. The problem is that most of these methods make no direct reference to c, but rather RawContext c and/or RawConfig c, which makes them ambiguous.
 One solution to this would be to instead use functional dependencies ``` class Context context rawContext rawConfig | context -> rawContext, context -> rawConfig, rawContext -> context, rawConfig -> context, rawContext -> rawConfig, rawConfig -> rawContext where
 ... ```
 but this would result in pretty cumbersome type signatures, which I want to avoid.
 Is it possible to get clean type signatures, as in a class with only one type variable (the wrapped context type) without resorting to AmbiguousTypes? I have not worked with type families much before, but they seem like a cleaner solution for something like this if they are applicable.

 I use the send to buffer quite a lot, so would ideally like a flow of send to python if the python buffer is not visible then open a window, hopefully which works regardless of which python file I am editing in the project.
 I know clojure has a better story for this but would also like the pop up the buffer if its not open for clojure code in case it can be done for one of the languages.

It's almost like you need to know the language but then also understand what the extension is trying to say. How should I reason about language extensions and what they do?

 Now I have many more lines that are like this that I want to type. Currently I just paste the previous line and do a Query Replace. But this is inefficient because the pattern is that only the part after the net_ changes and it is common on both sides (except for capitalization).
 Is there some workflow where I can define some temporary elisp code, then call it with just the suffix, and it automatically generates the next line (with the proper indent and everything).
 For example:
 Some Keybind + workarea
 Should generate
  pub net_workarea => b"_NET_WORKAREA", 
 I know that by the time somone points me in the right direction and I figure it out I could just manually write it :)
 But I would like to take this opportunity to learn if there is an efficient way of doing this.

 ​
  
Nice to hear from you. Doom emacs looks great! (Although I'm too much of a dinosaur to have tried it.) 
 The customization you can do in VSCode, or any other environment, stands in relation to that which can do in emacs as the sounds you can coax from a referee's whistle stand in relation to the music you can play on a piano. 
 But that's not the point. The point is that everything is a buffer -- EIAB. Until one has used emacs enough for that to sink in, one has not really used it, and one might as well stick with VSCode. Pick your favorite shell (bash, zsh, etc.) and make it your default shell in emacs. Then do M-x shell. Start using your new shell. Observe that it is just another buffer. Live with that for a while, until the profundity of it sinks in. Then accept your fate, which is to watch in pity, for the rest of your life, as your non-emacs colleagues struggle to interact with their computers. You're now a deer bounding through the woods, past coyotes chewing their own legs off from the traps they're stuck in. Unfortunately, you can never unsee that vision. Sorry!
  
​
 I'm still using Doom because I like the evil keybindings, but maybe one of you can convince me to fully commit!

Whether you have a large codebase or a small one, whether your project is
polyglot or monolingual, and whether you work in an enterprise organization or

 Whenever I select a region and execute test-overlay, if my cursor is in the region and I hit TAB the overlay disappears, if I'm outside, the normal TAB happens.
 However, if I put these functions in a mode:
 (defun my/remove () "NTS." (interactive) (remove-overlays)) (defvar test-map (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (keymap-set map "TAB" 'my/remove) map)) ;;;###autoload (defun test-overlay () "NTS."

 The keymap is never loaded. And if I put :keymap test-map in define-minor-mode, TAB will execute my/remove even thought it's not on my overlay (which looks normal).
 What am I missing that would make it work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm heavenly new to Haskell and asking myself how to solve the following problem. I have a simple data structre like this: data Document = Document { title :: String, content :: [String], wordCount :: Int } I want to have besides the default constructor where I have to provide a title and the content another one where I just have to provide the title and the content or just the title. And I also want to have a constructor function that creates out of a completely different data structure a Document. I find it pretty nasty to name all these constructor functions differently. Especially since I encountered this problem with a lot of different data structures. So I decided to use ad-hoc polymorphism provided by a generic type-class: class Factory a b where ‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­ create :: a -> b Which I use like this: instance Factory String ([String] -> Document) where create title words = Document { title = title, words = words, wordCount = 0 } instance Factory String Document where create title = Document { title = title, words = [], wordCount = 0 } instance Factory RawDocument Document where create RawDocument{..} = create title (splitOn " " content) Now I can use simply the create function everywhere with the defined input types. And it scales nicely with all my data structures. Do you see any problems with this approach? I'm really not sure if I'm missing something. I'm just facing one problem: - Either I define the factories in the same module as the data structure, but then I need to live with the name shadowing warnings for values like title and words (I would hate to name them differently since they describe the same thing) - Or I have a separate Factory-Module but then I have to live with the orphan instance warnings. Which is also pretty nasty What do you recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got the following function:
 (defun my/org-roam-capture-to-link () "In org-roam files, capture to node linked at point." (interactive) (when-let ((_ (org-roam-file-p)) ;; Only act in org-roam files (link-start (car (org-in-regexp org-link-bracket-re 1))) (link (save-excursion (goto-char link-start) (org-element-link-parser))) (id (plist-get (cadr link) :path)) ;; This will fail if there is no node (node (org-roam-node-from-id id))) ;; If there /is/ a node, capture to it. (org-roam-capture- :node node))) 
 This should capture to the org-roam node at the id linked at point, but only if point is at a link to such a node, and I'm in an org-roam file's buffer.
 Normally when I just run org-roam-capture and select an already existing node, no new text is added, and I just add whatever I need to and press C-c C-c.
 Now, If I'm on a link to an org-roam node, and run my/org-roam-capture-to-link interactively with M-x, it does exactly that: nothing new is added, exactly what I want.
 But I wanted to run it from org-metareturn. I added the symbol for the function to org-metareturn-hook. Now if I press M-RET on an appropriate link, I do get an org-roam capture, but it adds an empty heading on a newline (that is, it adds "\n* |", with the cursor at |).
 What's going on? How can I make the meta-return version work like the M-x version?
 Thanks!

 With LSP I'm able to get the behavior of Emacs nearly identical to VSCode. There are some small, nearly ignorable, areas where I do feel like code completion works better in VSC. Where can I get details about what LSP VSC uses for which language? How does it integrate so well with different languages like RJSX and CSS in my Next projects? I'm sure it only has to do with some LSP configs. 
 In Emacs I have to explicitly give the lsp configs whereas VSCode used to do it implicitly, I want to somehow locate what those configs were and then copy them over to Emacs.

 What I then wanted to do was configure vscode for Haskell and so I downloaded the Haskell extension which says ghcup is not installed and that intero isn't as well. At first glance GHCup seems to do the same thing as Stack (a kind of dependency manager). But Stack seems to do more than that, creating projects, testing, etc...
 To add to the confusion, there seems to be a Cabal library and a cabal-install package, both of which I don't understand.
 Not sure where to go from here honestly. At this point, I just want VSCode to work without installing tools that do the same thing. (I said seem to be the same because they are probably not)

I wonder how you work  with different languages in your Zettelkasten.
My problem is that I think about different topics in different languages: 
My question: how do I best deal with this in my Zettelkasten?
So far I tried to write all of my zettels in german, but I realize more and more, that this is sub-optimal: it introduces the added problem of adequate translation and some of the thoughts and arguments loose nuance in translation, or (worse) get added meanings and associations through the translation which weren't there in the original. The mental work of tranlating also introduces additional friction into the system.
How do you deal with this? Do you have a single language Zettelkasten and translate all of your thoughts into your primary language? Or do you mix and match, having Zettels written in different languages in the same Zettelkasten?
Kind regards]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not surprising most of us find ourselves doing more and more in Emacs as time goes on. Here's an environment that's completely malleable and transparent - a productive playground where workflow and tooling grow organically together, intertwined. 
 I sometimes feel like a blacksmith or the 'primitive technology' youtuber: building tools that make new tools possible, each more powerful and precise than the last, working in concert to open new possibilities. 
 As I think about that comparison, it strikes me that this must be the key to Emacs' allure. Most of our computing tools are delivered to us on a plate, like a modern mass-manufactured product. Impressively engineered and convenient to be sure, but closed and impersonal. In a funny way, I feel Emacs puts us in touch with a much deeper human tradition: moulding and shaping our environment to suit our own needs, instead of being moulded and shaped ourselves.

 I've been starting to build slightly more interesting applications, and was reading The ReaderT Design Pattern, so started to think maybe I wanted something like the following as a base monad (I heard this term on a podcast but I can't remember which).
 type App = ExceptT ProgrammeError (ReaderT AppEnv IO) 
 I imagine I can improve on this by using MonadError, MonadReader, etc. typeclasses, but I would like to know, when you write applications, what "base monad" you use (especially for different sizes of application -- nothing I'm writing is hugely complex but I am finding my code is becoming a big convoluted).

However, I am unable to grok Haskell concepts like I was able to for Lisp, and most tutorials I am finding for Haskell are catering to those who either are familiar with Haskell, or are absolute beginners with functional programming in its entierety. Is there a guide for someone of my background, who has dipped their toes in functional programming but not Haskell?

What do you guys recommend for setting up Emacs for PHP / Laravel? There is web-mode or php-mode and serenata and intelephense for LSP mode but I still don't know which would be the suitable combination for this setup... And Vue.js seems unusable on emacs since vue-mode is pretty outdated. Maybe I should give up? :(

 this is my .editorconf:
 root = true [*] indent_style = tab tab_width = 4 end_of_line = lf charset = utf-8 trim_trailing_whitespace = true insert_final_newline = true 
 I am running doom emacs with ts-ls with LSP for javascript.
 I have some files in my project that are indented with 4-width Tabs and that's how I like it. If I change something in them and save they stay properly indented with 4-width Tabs.
 I have other files in the same project that are indented with 2 spaces. I don't want that. I want to be able to convert that to 4-width tab but that does not happen automatically on save, they stay in 2 space formatting.
 Any new file I create in Emacs is also indented with 2 spaces, but if I create the file in VSCode and write some Tab spaced text and open it back in Emacs it stays Tab indented.
 How can I fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find it pretty unintuitive how magit, vterm, rg, and other commands that want to open a new window will interact with a multi-window setup. Sometimes they'll use an existing window, sometimes they'll make a new one. I prefer having things be predictable: terminals always go here, search results go there, and so on. I was looking for ways to tame this, and I found purpose, popper, shackle, and of course, directly hacking on display-buffer-alist.
 I also found winner-undo, which is nice, but I'd like to prevent things from getting messy rather than letting them get bad and then undoing them. And there doesn't seem to be a 'modern' clean approach; i.e., there's no window management equivalent of corfu. (Maybe this is an excuse for me to get my toes wet in actual emacs package development; purpose is probably the closest, but I don't like how it works by advising everything...)

It wouldn't be that difficult to write up a solution (e.g., download to a temporary directory, perhaps using something like url-retrieve-synchronously), but if a solution already exists, I'd like to start with that. Any ideas how that would be done would be greatly appreciated.

 Second Question is if i have the same problem how can i locate myself?

 My use case is this: I'm writing a document that has various indentation levels, and due to how its processed I can afford (eg) 50 characters on a "line". But the line may be indented so I can't just set the fill-column to 50, since I might be at column 8, 12, 16, etc. indentation. So I'd like it to be 50+column_of_first_character.
 Ideally then things like auto-fill-mode and fill-paragraph and such would work.
 Is this possible?

 I'm not sure what changes to make in the mainFun so that the benefits of using ByteStrings and Builders, in terms of the efficient time and space optimisations that they provide are still apparent. Moreover, I'm not certain how to use an efficient looping mechanism there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose you have a list of org-mode headings each with a property drawer. Suppose you have another list of org-mode headings, in a different buffer, say, each with a property drawer too. I'm looking for a way to update the values of properties of the first list of headings using the second list. So, for example, if I have: 
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: blue :AGE: 5 days :END: * Heading 2 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: red :AGE: 10 days :END: 
 I want to be able to update it with: 
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: green :END: * Heading 2 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: orange :END: 
 So that the result is this: 
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: green :AGE: 5 days :END: * Heading 2 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: orange :AGE: 10 days :END: 
 Now my questions: 
  
Is there some ready-made utility for doing this? 
 If not, can you think of some ready-made utilities that would help with this?
  
I thought I'd check with folks here to see if there's a likely better way than cooking up my own tool.
 I've been reading through the documentation of the org-element and property APIs and I have a very rough sense how to use it for what I want, but I'm having trouble with one issue: 
  
how do I get the list of properties (with or without their values) in the first list of headings so I get candidate properties to update using the second list? 
  
I understand org-entry-properties is a place to start, but I only want the properties explicitly listed in the property drawer. (If I call org-entry-properties on the first heading in the initial list, I get this: 
 (("CATEGORY" . "???") ("AGE" . "5 days") ("COLOR" . "blue") ("BLOCKED" . "") ("FILE") ("PRIORITY" . "B") ("ITEM" . "Heading 1")) 
 Can I just assume that there is a fixed list of default properties that will always be included in such a list?

 anyway, 
 Here is the documentation I'm following: https://github.com/hlissner/evil-multiedit 
 First, I can't find the 'evil-multiedit-default-keybinds' that it mentions. But then I noticed that the commands pallete already shows some keybinds. 
 When I try to execute 'evil-multiedit-match-and-next' it shows (M-d) as the keybind. It even says so at bottom that I should use 'M-d' if I execute the command in the pallete by hitting return. But in the actual editor if I try to use 'M-d' it says: 'I-Search Backward: [No Previous Search String]'. 
 I have not created any new keybinds myself. I'm just very much working on defaults so far.
 How can I fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Autothemer version 0.2.8 has some nice new features which theme designers will enjoy.
  
Generate a beautiful SVG image of the theme palette with autothemer-generate-palette-svg
 Select colors from autothemer--current-theme with autothemer-select-colorand autothemer--get-color (which does a lookup by color name).
  
I'm also outlining a spec for TVA (Theme Variant Architecture), which will help define a clear path for creating themes with multiple variations. 
 Hope you enjoy the update.
 EDIT: BTW if you have published a theme using Autothemer, do let me know here or by posting an issue https://github.com/jasonm23/autothemer/issues

I like the thought of periodically exporting things to HTML to make it viewable in my browser-of-choice. What I'm wondering, is, is there a way to have the export roll all of the journal files into a single destination file? I.e., perhaps an org-file that when exported will import all the files matching the name-pattern and include them?

I don't seem to be able to exit it without killing the buffer and re-opening it.
 more dramatically, that mode seems to disable undo somehow and thus it permanently munges my file.
 decipher-undo doesn't seem to do, well, anything.
  
So does anyone know how to unf*** the damage done by accidentally triggering decipher-mode? Alternatively, suggestions on how to make the decipher-mode function a noop in case it does get triggered?
 thx
 NOTE: 
  
(defun decipher-mode () t) 
  
thus making it non-interactive seems like it could help I have no idea what might be using decipher-mode under the hood.

        <updated>2022-08-22T10:37:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new version of LeanCheck is out (v1.0.0). LeanCheck is a property testing library (like QuickCheck) that tests values enumeratively.
 Example. Here is a simple example of LeanCheck in action showing that sorting is idempotent and list union is not commutative:
 > import Test.LeanCheck > import Data.List (sort, union) > check $ \xs -> sort (sort xs) == sort (xs::[Int]) +++ OK, passed 200 tests. > check $ \xs ys -> xs `union` ys == ys `union` (xs::[Int]) *** Failed! Falsifiable (after 4 tests): [] [0,0] 
 LeanCheck works on all types that are instances of the Listable typeclass and is able to derive instances automatically using either Template Haskell or GHC.Generics. See LeanCheck’s Haddock documentation for more details. LeanCheck is compatible with Hspec, Tasty and test-framework.
 What's new? Version 1.0.0 signalizes stability in the API. LeanCheck has not actually changed much in the past couple of years and there are no significant differences between the early 0.9 series.
 Installing. You can find LeanCheck on Hackage or GitHub. It is also tracked on Stackage. You can install it with:
 $ cabal install leancheck

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-roam-bibtex together with a helm-bibtex interface, and a master .bib file generated by Zotero. I'm able to comfortably create an Emacs frame, launch helm-bibtex and then select a paper I want to read. 
 Using the Fn keys, I can select whether I want to view the .pdf of the paper, or open the .org note file associated with it -- and if there are no notes, I am lead to an org-roam-capture template that creates a new notes file for me. From the notes file, I can invoke org-noter to view both the.pdf file and add notes to the note file at the same time.
 I would like to do something slightly different now. I typically use helm-bibtex to open the .pdf file of the reference directly, using pdf-tools. I browse the file, and add highlights, etc. I now want to open org-noter and view the associated notes, or if no notes file exists, use org-roam-capture to create it. 
 Unfortunately, I can't see any way of doing this at the moment. The best I can do is invoke org-noter and add notes to files listed in org-noter-default-files-name, so that all the notes end up in the same file. 
 Is there a function or hack I can use to get org-noter to search for an associated notes file for my .pdf, or use my org-roam-capture-template to create such a notes file?

 What kind of expression is this, and how do I extract "cell-contents" alone from from it?
 What is the syntax for including the file name in the reference, ie something along the lines of "filename::TableRef"?
 For now I have to test the function in the same file as the table, but I also want to do it externally.

 tldr; what are your tips for recording in emacs? 
 background
 I work in a legal environment. Sometimes I need to seek costs for time spent on a matter ('project' - I guess in emacs terms)
 I came to emacs a year or so ago via the Doom/org/org-roam popularity explosion.
 what I do now
 I tried using timers in org, but they are easy to forget to 'end'
 So, I use an excel spreadsheet, which has the same issue, but the empty cell helps remind me visually to enter my finish time on a task.
 It also has validation, functions etc that let me analyse and summarise my data
 what I'd like to do
 My workflow really could use:
  
Automatic time recording, for time spent editing documents;
 something smart enough not to cause me to seek costs for making a coffee, or leaving my computer on during lunch;
 some kind of reporting on the time spent
  
I've seen a few solutions for emacs - wakatime, buffer timer, activity-watch-time etc, and was wondering what everyone's experience of those, or any self-made systems, are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey friends,
 I'm using the following code in my init.el to build my agenda from all Roam nodes with the Project filetag:
 ;; The buffer you put this code in must have lexical-binding set to t! ;; See the final configuration at the end for more details. (defun my/org-roam-filter-by-tag (tag-name) (lambda (node) (member tag-name (org-roam-node-tags node)))) (defun my/org-roam-list-notes-by-tag (tag-name) (mapcar #'org-roam-node-file (seq-filter (my/org-roam-filter-by-tag tag-name) (org-roam-node-list)))) (defun my/org-roam-refresh-agenda-list () (interactive) (setq org-agenda-files (my/org-roam-list-notes-by-tag "Project"))) ;; Build the agenda list the first time for the session (my/org-roam-refresh-agenda-list) 
 The above is taken from a System Crafters video on YouTube. Show notes here.
 The problem I'm running into is that when I launch Emacs, I get an error that the symbol org-roam-node-list is void and my agenda launches as empty until I use org-roam-node-find to open up a node that has that Project filetag.
 After that point, the symbol I previously mentioned is no longer void and the agenda buffer is populated as expected.
 I should also mention that the code above is within the :config portion of use-package.
 Does anyone know what changes I might implement so that org-roam-node-list is not void upon launching Emacs?
 All the thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am able to test the following issue on Emacs versions 25 to 27. Due to the tramp connection crashing the entire Emacs instance for me on Emacs 28 and 29 using El Capitan on my mac, I don't know if this particular behavior with directory-files-and-attibutes still exists. Before opening the proverbial "Pandora's Box" by submitting a formal bug report, is anyone able to confirm whether Emacs 29 currently behaves the same and (if known) why that is the case? [It is a Pandora's Box because I would potentially be assisting in debugging the crashes, before getting to the underlying issue.]
 Step #1: Establish a remote Tramp session over ssh.
 Step #2: Call directory-files-and-attributes using the following optional arguments:
 (directory-files-and-attributes "/ssh:user@01.23.456.789:/home3/lawlist" t nil t nil)
 Step #3: The return value includes both the starting directory, and the parent of the starting directory. [FYI: If there are lots of files/folders, the default settings of Emacs will truncate the list that gets returned ... so, either increase the print length or use something like (message "%s" ....) to avoid truncation.]
 /ssh:user@01.23.456.789:/home3
 /ssh:user@01.23.456.789:/home3/lawlist
 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: Do not return the starting directory, and do not return the parent directory of the starting directory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the controversies I've set up elsewhere is the provocative statement that "Haskell is for s-code". That is to say, since Haskell has a very low refactoring cost, it's possible to just scratch out anything (this is a bit extreme) that works, then refactor it into clean code, something that is more difficult in languages with substantial refactoring costs.
 ​
 There's also something that seems to be "pseudocode-driven development", i.e, you scratch out something in undefined and error "todos", and constantly branch downwards, and the type system might force you to play Type Tetris, but you can often hash something out before you work on refactoring and optimizing it.
 ​
 I wouldn't call myself an experienced Haskeller; hell, by the definition "you're not a real Haskeller until you've written your first compiler" I'm not a Haskeller. A question to more experienced Haskellers: is Haskell as a language for prototyping then refactoring a useful definition? If so, what are the limitations of such (a recent project had to be completely rewritten because I lost the ability to understand the code, despite constantly using long variable names)?
 ​
 And if only-okay quality Haskell code can be refactored constantly, can Haskell be sold as a language, for, well, s-code? That's a bit too "marketer-speak", as it completely upends common perceptions of Haskell, but the weaker and more polite "prototype code" or "draft code" might have sway. But the more radical terminology, one, attracts attention, and second, makes Haskell seem approachable ("you mean I don't have to be a rocket scientist to be productive in Haskell?").

 I might have found a way to make my config more scalable. For context, my config file is a 200LOC litterate config (I know. It's not that bad) and I have a lot of packages that I use every once in a while that clutters my config and increases my startup time (3.61 seconds). Moreover, every time I migrate my emacs config, the initial startup time (use-package downloads everything) is annoyingly high (I just checked, it was about 7 minutes).
 The solution
 Lazy load (and install!) everything. nn I wrote a small library that lets you define your packages and their configuration as a dependency graph. A package will be loaded (and installed, if necessary) when a dependent package gets loaded, or when a generated placeholder function gets run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! 
 I've just released version 0.9.0 of the dunai libraries, which comes with version 0.13.6 of bearriver. 
 For those unfamiliar, dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants. bearriver itself is an API-compatible implementation of Yampa. All versions of GHC from 7.6 to 9.4 are supported.
 Release information
 This is mainly a maintenance release. Among other changes, this version improves the documentation in dunai-test. Additionally, a function that was exposed unnecessarily is being deprecated in preparation for its future removal.
  
Release: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai/releases/tag/v0.9.0.
 
Hackage:
  
dunai: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai.
 dunai-test: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai-test
 bearriver: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bearriver
 
 
Repo: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai.
 
 Upcoming changes
 We are synchronizing releases with the Yampa project to ensure that bearriver incorporates any changes added to Yampa. Additionally, the goal is to eventually use Yampa's tests also to give bearriver full test coverage.
 Two changes are being discussed that will potentially affect users:
 - The introduction of a new constraint in VectorSpace in simple-affine-space would alter the type constraints of some functions. See #298.
  
A re-structuring of the API to better reflect the purpose of the implementation. This could also lead to a division of dunai into multiple libraries. See #305.
  
The next release is expected to be published on October 21, 2022.
 Happy Haskelling!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am completely new to Haskell but not new to functional programming (I come form OCaml). Since I wasn't sure how to unit test, I did the following:
 I created this method
 -- msg is the name of the test unit_test :: Bool -> String -> IO () unit_test cond msg = if cond then putStrLn ("\ESC[32mPassed: \ESC[0m" ++ msg) else putStrLn ("\ESC[31mFAILED: \ESC[0m" ++ msg) 
 and my tests look like this:
 sumTest :: () -> IO () sumTest () = do "sum 1" & unit_test (List.sum [1, 2, 3, 4] == 10) "sum 2" & unit_test (List.sum [1, 1, 1, 1] == 4) "sum 3" & unit_test (List.sum [2, 1, 1, 1] == 5) "sum 4" & unit_test (List.sum [3, 1, 1, 1] == 6) "sum 5" & unit_test (List.sum [4, 1, 1, 1] == 7) "sum 6" & unit_test (List.sum [0, 0, 0, 0] == 0) "sum 7" & unit_test (List.sum [-1, 1, -1, 1] == 0) "sum 8" & unit_test (List.sum [2, 2, -2, 2] == 4) 
 This is testing a custom sum function. What do you think of this? While we are at it, what are some actual unit testing libraries I should look into. I have stack downloaded and I am using stack test to run my tests.

Do you throw away your literature notes and fleeting notes after turning them into permanent notes?
I have been taking literature notes for a couple of days now and it’s getting difficult and difficult lately to organize them.
Should I just throw them away?
Or should I keep and organize them despite it taking a lot of time?
Or should I keep them without organizing?]]></summary>

For overlays mode: drawers are not hidden (not folded). I could not find how to hide it by default. I do have org-cycle-hide-drawer-startup set to True.
 For text-properties mode: search in a buffer does not unfold sub-headings. If a content is hidden in 3rd or 4th level, it is a pain to reach to it. Also, in org-roam backlinks, it does not hide backlinks id. I don't know how to fix this.
  
Ideally, I would like to use text-properties since it is supposed to be fast but with the above two customization. I would appreciate any directions. An alternate solution is welcome too. Thanks!

 This opens up terminal emacs really fast, without any config. Here, I would like to:
 - disable menu bar mode (within emacs, it is M-x menu-bar-mode )
 - use evil mode and I dont want to reload the entire config file just to be able to use it 
 Is there a way to pass these arguments to the command line when open emacs?

Assuming org-hide-emphasis-markers is enabled, is there a way to yank the text without the emphasis-markers as is? In Evil, yanking the emphasized text includes the markers.

Let's assume I'll need to forward my org-clock-report to my boss at the end of the week to show how much time I spent on project a or activity b.
 I was thinking one way to do this was with a workflow state of something like DAILY or TRACK or ONG (ongoing) and a custom agenda view that compartmentalizes those tasks so I can clock in and out of them easily.
 Any other ideas on how to do this?

 I would to filter the agenda view using a tag. I am looking for something along the lines of
 (agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 7) (org-agenda-overriding-header (format "Weekly view of %s\n" project-name)) (???org-agenda-include-entry-if-tag??? 'ABC))) 
 where the (to me unknown) function ???org-agenda-include-entry-if-tag??? would accept entries tagged with ABC.
 How can I achieve this effect?

 The changelog (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-2.8.0.0/changelog) is full of improvements, big and small. Among most important ones are support for Abstract FilePath Proposal (say goodbye to type FilePath = String) and compatibility with WebAssembly platform (stay tuned for GHC 9.6).
 This release would never happen without a new team of maintainers: Viktor Dukhovni and Julian Ospald, and is a culmination of contributions from 36 volunteers, who spent their time and effort to improve unix. Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm 28, I've been coding since I was 14. started with easy-eclipse (I know, lol), then moved to eclipse. Used that for a while, even through college, although I also became really handy with Vim. In my first job, I started using IntelliJ and I just loved it (scala developer), as far as IDEs go nothing touches IntelliJ if your focus is deep git integration, debugging, code completion and stuff. Now, I use VSCode. 
 I have ALWAYS wanted to learn Emacs though. Always seemed so cool. Just seems like I need to learn to be an OG. It's a stupid thought, I know, but it is nonetheless. Just that whenever I would try, I have twice, I would keep fighting with it for simple tasks and then some important work would come up and I'd jump back to a familiar editor to get things done quickly. 
 I've been reading a lot about how VSCode is just about a better editor than Emacs now. Many Emacs lovers are making videos or writing articles on how much they love VSCode now. I really want to try Emacs again. I'm asking the community to either convince me and welcome me to the fold or convince me to not use it and stay with VS Code. I am VERY sure I'm not the only person who would benefit from this post. Others must be in similar situations.

 I find Haskell really interesting and I have been reading Learn you a Haskell, but I would like to start working towards some project-based learning. 
 I’ve been watching this Reddit and a few other languages (C, C++, etc) and once in a while I’ll see a post about someone learning for a year and then finding a job. I’ve always wondered, what types of projects would I need to master to put me at the level of being able to find work based on those skills?

 My main gripe is the handleKeys function in the end. I thought a Picture which is a simple window can be redrawn with a grid in it when an event is fired. That is about it. But I have not managed to change any simple event to a new Behavior which is a redrawn Picture.
 Can anyone comment ? I may have coded this completely wrongly.
 Compiler error is this.
  Couldn't match type ‘Picture’ with ‘Behavior Picture’ Expected type: Moment (Behavior Picture)

 1) I want it to automatically calculate profit / losses. I known that Emacs can do some arithmetic operations with tables, using patterns like that: 
 ​
 #+TBLFM: $3=($2 - u/-1$2)/7::$5=$Weeks*$Rent; %.2f
 ​
 2) And i want automatically create tables or just string that show me, how much i win and lose, summarizing week and month (profit / lose).
 Example:
 Week: -10$
 Month: +100$
 ​
 I'm just wondering, it is generally possible or not. I really like Emacs ecosystem and its flexibility. Markdown is very limited in comparison with Org-Mode, plus Joplin is pretty bloated software... 
 ​
 P.S. Sorry for my English, I hope, you understood me. Thanks! :-)

 Where the ^M is a newline character, I guess.
 How could I print progress like it does on a terminal into the process buffer, overwriting the previous % and respecting newlines? I have looked at process filters but cannot understand how I would write one.

 After further tests with a variety of numbers it is clear that emacs see a sequence of numbers with an e in the middle as a number in E notation format.
 How can I coerce the values in the columns to be seen as strings?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am very particular about how text appears in the text editor. I cannot compromise on poorly rendered font. In an attempt to make text in emacs on Windows look crisp, I tried several fonts. I blamed the fonts that they are not good and kept trying different fonts.
 Then I installed MacType. The before and after of using MacType is huge. I do not need any custom fonts out on the internet there and was settled on Consolas. 
 So if you are like me or having issues try installing MacType. 
 https://www.mactype.net/
 Note: Make sure that the MacType service is running before you launch emacs. I run the emacs server in the startup and it didn't render the fonts properly. I had to make sure of this dependency.

 I found this code on emacs stackexchange showing how cl-loop is used to gather information from an org-table
  #+NAME: my-filter #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :var tbl=table1 val="USA" :colnames y (cl-loop for row in tbl if (equal (nth 3 row) val) collect row into newtbl finally return newtbl) #+END_SRC 
 I tried something similar with cl-loop but failed terribly, so I switch back to my trusty dolist.
 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :var tbl=ParedTable val="." :results output raw (let ((somevar '())) (dolist (row tbl) (add-to-list 'somevar (append (list (nth 2 row)) (nth 0 row)))) somevar) #+END_SRC 
 The code creates an alist from some columns of a table.
 How can I used the cl-loop to accomplish the same thing?

 A couple of days ago there was a post about org-noter. It looked like not everyone is aware of the package and what it does so I recorded a short screencast to highlight it's features. 
 org-noter is a annotation package that helps extract content from PDFs/Epubs/DjVus. It has a lot of promise for incremental reading/learning so I'm planning to work on it myself. My hope is that by making this someone else decides to contribute as well.

In a programmers context, he argued spending your time learning React, Javascript etc. is less valuable than learning meta knowledge. Object skills help get a job, but are not timeless like statistics, math, algorithm analysis, physics (ok physics isn't timeless but it is until a better theory comes along or assumptions are falsified) etc.

  * First Level Heading :first: ** Second Level Heading :second: *** Third Level Heading :third: 
 I've noticed that there is an org-tags-column variable in Emacs which is set to a value of -77 by default. I tried changing it and refreshing the tags list with C-u C-c C-q. The only thing it does is how things align in Emacs, but it doesn't change the fact that the tags don't align when viewing the document with a different text editing software.

 I want to know what to place instead of ????, and how to define a suitable backend, so that:
  
If I call test-backend-export-as-ascii on the a buffer narrowed to the first subtree, I get a buffer whose contents are, say:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm trying to learn Emacs and I have the quest of changing the theme.
 Emacs creates an .emacs~ file automatically.
 I've also created an .emacs file, in both I have
 (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
 But emacs can't find shit. Any clue why?
 Edit:
 Somehow the custom-theme-load-path is somewhere else in Program Files instead of %Appdata%/.emacs.d/themes/.
 For someone stumbling across the same problem:
 Emacs\emacs-28.1\share\emacs\28.1\etc\themes
 Edit2:
 Solved by creating init.el instead of .emacs in /%appdata%/.emacs.d
 i.e. /%appdata%/.emacs.d/init.el instead of /%appdata%/.emacs.d/.emacs
 And inside .init.el:
 (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 1993 or 1994 I installed Linux on a home PC for the first time. I think it was Yggdrasil I got my paws on. I had to travel some distance to buy set of cds.
 The servers I had access to at work were huge and powerful but so many people were using them 24/7 that the interaction was slow. 
 Starting Emacs was slow.
 Eventually I got my Pentium PC to run Linux and that was a magical moment. I logged in and started Emacs. I was blown away It just popped up.
 So much power in my hands. 
 Pop forwards to today. I am running Ubuntu on a nice Core9 with 32GB. Immensely powerful. Starting Emacs takes time. How can it be that with all this power it is slower?
 Then last week I installed OpenBSD 7 on a much slower system. I logged in. Installed Emacs. I started it up and --bang-- it is up. Just like in 1993/4. 
 Now this is all using the standard OpenBSD and Ubuntu Emacs packages. With 0 customizations, configs, or anything else.
 My guess would be that if I dug into the packages I would find that the Ubuntu default has more stuff in it.
 It was a nostalgic feeling though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am very new to Emacs, I see the potential it has, but I want to make sure I can accurately describe it to others. I have made-up my own explanation of Emacs, and I just want to make sure I'm not saying anything blatantly wrong. 
  
Emacs is more than a text editor, it's a Lisp interpreter. Anything you can code with Lisp, you can do in Emacs. Much like how a web browser is just an HTML (& CSS & Javascript) Interpreter. Anything you can write in HTML, you can make a web browser do. 
 However, web browsers are external to your computer. You can use a web browser to edit a photo, but you have to upload the photo, do the edits, and then download the photo again, and that's inefficient. Emacs works completely on your system, using your computer's resources to their fullest potential. A web browser could never make files or folders on your computer, but Emacs can, and incorporate so much more into your system. 
  
This is the assumption I've managed to get out of my first few days with Emacs. Let me know if I'm letting some large component out, or if even this is just scratching the surface of what Emacs can do.

Dynamic Exception Reporting in Haskell by Matt Parsons

Exceptions kind of suck in Haskell. You don’t get a stack trace. They don’t show up in the types of functions. They incorporate a subtyping mechanism that feels more like Java casting than typical Haskell programming.

Haskell Foundation DevOps Weekly Log, 2022-08-17 by Bryan Richter

In the last week and a half, I continued to focus on spurious failures. To wrap things up before my break, I wrote a wiki page about the spurious failure effort that explains my methodology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am a graduate of Applied mathematics and computer science, have been passionate about Haskell for a couple years, it single-handedly got me into programming as a hobby and now I want to connect my professional career with it.
 About my qualifications. I took the MetaLamp education program which included a good set of books, for example Kurt's Get Programming with Haskell. In my free time I also read a couple, like Functional design and architecture. Some codewars catas and video courses with tasks were also conquered. I completed two educational projects: multi messenger chat bot and news server. Both projects were reviewed by the company's devs. Currently learning Plutus.
 So I am looking for the employer who will be willing to take an young and eager developer into their ranks, preferably on remote basis. I don't have a specific technology stack or problem to work on in mind.
 Also worth noting that I am currently in Russia, but relocation to near abroad is possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi emacs friends,
 your expertise and wisdom is required.
 Please let me first describe my use case.
 I'm using electric pair (https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElectricPair) and my humble init for this is like
 (electric-pair-mode 1) (setq electric-pair-pairs '((?\{ . ?\}) (?\( . ?\)) (?\[ . ?\]) (?\" . ?\"))) 
 Which is sufficient for coding and simple text. For org-mode however I also want to use the "electric pairing" for "*" (and maybe other markup features in org-mode like "~" for example).
 So I added
 (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (setq electric-pair-pairs (append electric-pair-pairs '((?\* . ?\*)))))) 
 Problem here is that is now set for all the other modes as well which I don't want.
 I only want this to be appended for org-mode buffers nothing else.
 Due to a lack of fantasy I don't even know how to approach this.
 ​
 Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks for your time guys!

of my computer, be it for separating professional and personal use, testing

A NixOS specialisation is a mechanism to describe additional boot entries

non-specialised configuration.

When do you need specialisations
You may have hardware occasionally connected to your computer, and some
of these devices may require incompatible changes to your day-to-day
configuration. Specialisations can create a new boot entry you can use

 I am thinking about releasing a new library which is basically pandas for Haskell. It is built around a data frame type represented as a mapping from column names to column vectors.
 I am looking for suggestions for the name of the library and the name of the datatype.
 Similar existing libraries: tables (Data.Table) and Frames (Frames.Frame).
 My suggestions: 
  
pandas and Data.DataFrame
 hsPandas and Data.DataFrame
 handas and Data.DataFrame
  
Reason: Pandas and its DataFrame type are so ubiquitously used for and associated with the use-cases this library addresses, that I think discoverability of the library would benefit from having pandas in its name.

 The first two have a bit of code smell, so I opted for the third, but is there a better way? A prescribed way? How would you do (or how have you done) this in personal or work projects?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hallo!
 I'd like to make a presentation with org and beamer export with a lot of images. When writing beamer tex directly with \usebackgroundtemplate before starting the frame environment.
 ``` \usebackgroundtemplate{\includegraphics[width = \the\paperwidth , height = \the\paperheight]{./P8091762.JPG}}
 \begin{frame} ..... ``` Setting the background seems to be the easiest way to achieve what I want? Edit: That is, I want images that take up the whole slide without any margins.
 Is there any way to set the background per slide using org-beamer-mode? Seems I cant insert raw latex between the frame environments with #+latex:, the line will end up inside a frame environment and not work. Can I somehow tell the export to insert the line after closing the environment? Or is there an org-beamer-mode parameter I can set per heading that I missed?

 Currently looking for a new note taking system with pdf's, the org-roam + org-roam-bibtex + citar + org-noter combo is perfect.
 However, I have the impression that org-noter is dead, and that using it now will cause me problems later on.
 Moreover, no changes have been made for about 3 years in its github repo..
 Do you have an alternative to org-noter, do you use a fork?
 ​
 Thanks you in advance for yours answers

 I want to do some scientific writing for fun, for which I want to be able to insert citations and bibliographies directly in org-mode. I don't want to use latex and/or render org files in any other format; what I want to achieve is something like:
 * Some text [1] [1] - Full reference from a global bib file 
 where both the numbering and bibliography section are updated on a command/keystroke. I use citar to insert references into org files - that works great - but I have no idea how to generate bibliography and numbering. So far most of the advice I found online was related to rendering bibliography in latex / html, which is not what I need.
 I would be really grateful for some pointers. Thanks!

 Is there any compatible library already available that can do what I need?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you use Slick, please try 3.4.0-RC3 by changing the version in your build.
 After a week, if no regressions have been reported we will G-d willing release 3.4.0 (final).
 3.4.0 is mostly about moving to a more efficient community-maintained model. A huge number of community-contributed fixes and improvements are included. Furthermore, a ton of work has been put into automating things so that merging pull requests, keeping the documentation website up to date, and cutting releases can be done effortlessly.
 You can see the draft release notes here and the upgrade guide at https://scala-slick.org/doc/prerelease/upgrade.html#upgrade-from-3-3-x-to-3-4-0. The latest docs are at https://scala-slick.org/doc/prerelease/index.html.
 After 3.4.0 is released, the top priority is Scala 3 support, G-d willing. Stefan Zeiger, the original author of Slick, wrote an implementation already, but there is work that still needs to be done to get it ready for consumption. I plan to release the result as 3.5.0.
 After that, I would like to see Slick evolve freely.
 If you would like to get involved, feel free to DM me. Or, help fund Slick by sponsoring me: https://github.com/sponsors/nafg.
 P.S. GitHub Discussions is enabled and there is now a #slick channel on the main Scala Discord: https://discord.gg/yQheBhUtAa

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago I was browsing the Evernote forum and I remember a member who described his method of organizing notes by putting all of them into one single folder called "Inbox" and he did not use the folder or tagging feature of the software at all.
 The only thing he did was attaching tags in the title of notes using hash signs (if I recall correctly) or he named the titles in such a way that they included the tags in the title, like so:
 Title of Note #tag #tag2 #tag3 Title of Note2 #tag #tag2 #tag3 Title of Note3 #tag #tag2 #tag3 
 I was thinking about using the same approach. For example, I just want some main headings (computer, health, home, etc..)
  * Computer :computer: ** Manage Your Email in Emacs With Mu4e 
 I would need to tag the second level heading but since I wrote the title in such a way that it contains the tags, does it worth it? The title already includes the relevant tags: email, emacs, and mu4e.
 Similar:
  ** How to Install Apache and PHP on Fedora Linux The keywords apache, php, fedora, and linux are all included in the title 
 This way I can search with swiper or consult-line and find the notes easily. The only thing is to write concise titles that are rich in relevant keywords.
 Of course tags have their own benefit but the more I was thinkering with them the more confused I got.
 What do you think about this approach? I would be curious about your opinion.

I set up a stack project, added quickspec-2.1.5@sha256:very-long-sha to extra-deps, and when I tried to build the thing, I got an error with a suggestion to add twee-lib-2.2@sha256:another-very-long-sha to me extra deps. So I did, and right now I'm getting this:
 Twee/Term.hs:92:28: error: Ambiguous occurrence 'singleton' It could refer to either 'Twee.Term.Core.singleton', -- stuff here or 'Data.List.singleton', -- more stuff here 
 and the same in several other places when stack tries to build twee-lib. I have no fancy compiler options enabled, the whole stack config is pretty basic. Is anyone able to use this lib? What am I missing?

        <updated>2022-08-16T19:20:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just in time for the start of the school year, I'm happy to announce the public release of hwtest, a Scala 3 library for problem sets (generically, "homeworks"). This is a near-total rewrite of a homegrown system I've been using with students since 2013.
 The basic idea is that the teacher creates some problems to solve, and some test cases for those problems. The students then implement the functions and can check their work against the test cases.
 A starter file might look like this: ``` object hwExample extends hwtest.hw("CS123"): def userName = ??? 
 def square(x: Int): Int = ???
 test("square", square, "x") 
 def isOdd(n: Int): Boolean = ??? ignoretest("isOdd", isOdd, "n")  The student would fill in their name  def userName = "Margaret Hamilton"  and then take a stab at the first function  def square(x: Int): Int = x * x  Then run their code to check their work:  Margaret Hamilton Data source: hwExample.tests (remote) Begin testing square at Tue Aug 16 10:12:48 EDT 2022 ..... Passed 5/5 tests in 0.71 seconds. ***** Ignoring tests for isOdd.  Next they change the `ignoretest` to `test`, and take a stab at the second function. Re-running the code, they get  CS123: hwExample (hwtest 1.0.0) Margaret Hamilton Data source: hwExample.tests (remote) Begin testing square at Tue Aug 16 10:15:22 EDT 2022 ..... Passed 5/5 tests in 0.44 seconds. Begin testing isOdd at Tue Aug 16 10:15:23 EDT 2022 .... Test #5 *** FAILED *** n = -21 Expected answer: true Received answer: false Passed 4/5 tests in 0.09 seconds. ```
 Obviously, we also want our students to learn how to make their own tests, so I wouldn't use this ALL the time, but it works great for less experienced students who are learning to program.

 This code compiles fine in ghci.
 func :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a func a b = a + b func' :: (Num a) => a -> a func' = func f f :: Integral a => a f = 2 
 But this gives an error saying,
  * Could not deduce (Integral a) arising from a use of `f' from the context: Num a bound by the type signature for: func' :: forall a. Num a => a -> a at test.hs:6:1-26 Possible fix: add (Integral a) to the context of the type signature for: func' :: forall a. Num a => a -> a * In the first argument of `func', namely `f' In the expression: func f In an equation for func': func' = func f | 7 | func' = func f | ^ 
 But if I change the second function as,
 func :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a func a b = a + b func' :: (Integral a) => a -> a func' = func f f :: Integral a => a f = 2 
 This compiles fine.
 I was expecting the second snippet to work, cause an Integral Instance is a Num Instance. Why can I pass a Num Instance to a function expecting Integral Instance (First code snippet), Since a Num Instance may or may not be an Integral Instance.
 Assuming I cannot pass an Integral Instance to a Num Instance, why did the third code snippet not throw an error? clearly func expects a Num Instance while it is given f which returns an Integral Instance.
 Any blogs or video links about the Haskell type system and how the type hierarchy works which addresses issues like this would be helpful. Relevant answers are also welcomed Ofcourse.

If I understand well, Haskell is not exactly implementing System F, since we can have non-halting functions. But on the other hand, can the halting of a function for another reason than laziness constitute a proof for the theorem corresponding to its type? I also wonder how can one implement the existential quantifier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the chapter 4, Binary Search, of the book "Algorithm Design with Haskell", it says "if f is a strictly increasing function, x < f(x+1)". I do not understand that, because if I choose the square root, a strictly increasing function, as f, then this property does not hold.
 Can someone explain? Thanks.
 p/s: I created an issued on the author's github repo https://github.com/jmgimeno/algorithm-design-with-haskell/issues/1
 Edit: my mistake, the GitHub repo is not from the author.
 Edit: sorry everyone, my mistake again, I missed the point that the domain and codomain of f are natural numbers.
 Edit: Thank you everyone. I think I understand the reasoning now. Because the domain and codomain are natural numbers, f can only increase its argument, so x < f(x) < f(x+1)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[... in a real-world (non-toy) setting?
 As toy-projects I consider the infamous quick-sort or primes example or stuff like unlimited queues. They are nice indeed, but shouldn't be used to sell a language (so quick-sort and primes died in defending success at all costs).
 I sometimes use lazy eval to calculate small ad-hoc lists on-the-fly (which are mostly optimized out by GHC magic) to feed them to various functions, but otherwise I think I don't benefit from lazy eval really? Mostly I hate that I don't like when GHC magic kicks in and when not?
 Do I need to learn Core to write performant Haskell (because I didn't have to learn intermediate compiler languages when I used OCaml, Java or Python)?
 Cheers.

 In the past, I've seen various comments about how Scala 2's type system was not sound, and several other scathing remarks from, eg Edward Kmett. See this quora post or this reddit comment for instance. 
 I'm curious if Scala 3 has overcome some of these difficulties, especially with how implicits have been reworked and enums have been introduced to implement ADTs. 
 Beyond that, I'm wondering how folks feel about Scala coming from Haskell. For the simple case, I like how close it looks to Python, which I write for work, but I worry that encoding of some abstractions is just plastered on -- I wasn't very encouraged by Zio and Cats examples, I saw, for instance. Perhaps that's just owing to a syntax as light-weight as Haskells, though?

I know it's really nothing major, just bothers me a bit and i'm wondering if this is a common occurrence with emacs or is it just my system. It can happen more often when folding-unfolding headers in an org file, just a small delay (~1sec) at random, for the action to perform. Not searching for the magic solution, just wanted to see if it is just me or if i might be doing something wrong.
 Thanks for taking the time to read this.
 P.S. My config is really minimal, just the colorscheme, ivy, haskell mode, yasnippet, auctex and my key maps. Also my pc is 7 yo but its more than capable of running intense tasks, and i think vanilla Emacs isn't one of them.

 Clearly not the type of thing I'll be able to easily google so I figured might as well make an informal ask on the sub. 
 So if you're aware of mbti and care at all, what is your type?

 Have also been researching smart contracts on Eth and trying to understand the possible implications of allowances, and spending permissions, say for staking on ERC20 tokens. 
 I was directed to some chain explorers to find and revoke these permissions on Eth. 
 Wondering a few things in relation to ADA. Does the function of staking and eUTXO make smart contract risks, or allowances any different than on other chains? 
 Are there any sort of tools or contract checkers on ADA for lookups? 
 Hopefully this isn't an annoying or improper post. I understand Haskell is used for many other applications, but my question is ADA specific.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I am an Emacs newbie coming from vim. So far I really like the Emacs experience! However, I still struggle with a very simple task: I like having an internal border around my frame, which I set via the default-frame-alist list. While that works fine I am not able to automatically adjust the internal-frame color to the theme's background color. I can do it manually buy using
 (defun my/adjust_internal_border_color () "Adjust the internal border color to match the theme's background color" (custom-set-faces! '(internal-border :background "#FAFAFA" ;; (format "%s" (upcase (prin1-to-string ((car (cdr (assoc 'bg doom-themes--colors))))))) ;; (car (cdr (assoc 'bg doom-themes--colors))) )) ) 
 Though, when I try to do it automatically by using one of the commented lines above instead of the color string, I get a Wrong type argument: strings, ... error. I guess this is due to my very poor knowledge of Lisp and probably very easy to fix. Maybe one of you can help me out?
 Many thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://github.com/orgtre/qpdf.el
 Hi, this is my first Emacs package! It provides a transient wrapper for the qpdf command-line tool aimed especially at users of pdf-tools or at least DocView. With it one can, for example, remove/reorder/split/rotate pages of a pdf file, merge pdf files, remove annotations, and apply a range of transformations to a pdf file. See the qpdf documentation.
 I used this package to learn transient, so it may also be helpful for people looking to do the same. Comments and suggestions are most welcome. For example, I wonder if I should and how I could define custom suffix classes for better handling qpdf arguments like --collate[=n] which are a switch but also optionally take a value, or complex ones like --overlay file [options] --?

Beside that, I would like to store temporary notes that I probably remove at some point. I would like to put the temporary notes in a separate file. I was thinking in creating a temp.org or misc.org file, even though I'm not sure if the names are okay. Do you use any naming for a notebook that works more like a temporary notebook for you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I’ve spent last two years working on a lightweight library for configuring a http client and http server to communicate over tls/ssl. I have tested it with over 40+ http clients for java, scala and kotlin. The core library contains only one transitive dependency, slf4j-api, and the remaining part only uses the available classes within the jdk.
 In the past I was required to configure a http client with different configurations depending on the project requirements, such as:
  
One way authentication
 Two way authentication
 Using multiple truststores and keystores
 Using pem files
 Reloading ssl
  
To make it easy to reuse for myself and everyone I thought it would be good to make a library out of it and also contribute back to the community. I wanted to hide all the verbosity away and just provide easy to use builder methods without needing to know how to create SSLContext, KeyManager, TrustManager etc. I initially posted it on the java channel, but I thought it could also be intresting for scala developers. Hope you guys like it. Feel free to send my some critiques!

 Did anything changed in that area since Cabal-install 1.x? Back then I've used sandboxes local to a project which could be at least manually swept out, a crude but safe way. Can't find that feature in 3.x versions. Now everything goes to cabal/store which bloats ad infinitum and can't find any suggestion in user docs how to alleviate this problem. Any idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've decided to give Emacs one last try, but need exact instructions for the following simple feature.
 You click a button / press a hotkey, choose a folder (not a file!), and Emacs opens up an Emacs window with a tree view of that folder's contents. In this tree view, folders are expandable and collapsible. Clicking files in this tree-view opens them as buffers for editing in the main window. 
 In other words, I want the same basic experience as in Kate or VS Code when you click "open folder".
 Please don't answer with just "projectile" or "dired". I need exact, detailed, reproducible steps, or an Elisp script. What to put into init.el after I install the packages, which hotkeys to map, how to make it all work together. Because last time I rage quit Emacs after spending a ton of time, and seeing that the different plugins (Ivy, Projectile, Treemacs) didn't synchronize with each other.
 Or just tell me that Emacs can't do that, so I don't ever spend any time on it =)
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently self-studying Haskell because it has long interested me to write pure functional code due to the guarantees on no side effects. 
 The concepts in themselves that I have learned till now are moderate on difficulty level. Things that I have studied till now are higher order programming, currying of functions, algebraic data types, map, filter etc. I have been following this course and doing the assignements and have done the first 3 of them : https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html
 The topics I have encountered but don't feel very confident about are : how the laziness of Haskell works, estimating time/space complexity of functions that I'm writing. 
 My main concern is how do I go about reasoning about how efficient the functions that I'm writing are. In imperative languages like Java, C++ etc.. it's so straightforward but it feels very tedious to think about in Haskell. Any tips on how to improve in this topic would be helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 I tried emacs out in the late 90s, and gave up because I couldn't remap `C-x` to `'next-line` (I still use WordStar keybindings, mock away). I thought I'd try again. It's been 25 years. Surely you can re-map `C-x` by now? It even has evil-mode, so it might work.
 It doesn't work. At least I can't get it to work.
 It works fine if I open a file and do normal stuff. As soon as I try to use `counsel-describe-function` or really almost anything in the mini-buffer at all... blamo. `C-x` is mapped to something else, and I get `Key Sequence C-x X starts with non-prefix key C-x` 
 So, is there a way to fix this? Or should I just try again in 25 years?

But I was debugging a problem with my init file which hadn't loaded completely, had the problem halfway solved but then accidentally suspended the Emacs GUI. Now I have to restart Emacs and redo that work for no good reason.
 Being able to suspend Emacs from a terminal makes sense, but why does this feature exist at all when running it in a GUI? If anything, it seems like some kind of practical joke.
 There doesn't seem to be any way to recover the previous state of the program. I already tried all the suggestions on this page.
 I'm sure I can't be the first to complain about this. Would a bug report be a waste of time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering about the trajectory of my zettelkasting. Am I just wandering around? Do I have a coherent path? I've been thinking about my ZK, whether it supports my goals, and if I'm feeding it appropriately. Maybe this is something I shouldn't worry about. Does this resonate with you?
What are my feelings about my zettelkasting?
Please open up and share with the community what you've been working on and your plans for your zettelkasting this week.
This past week found me doing:
A deep dive into structured python programming. I'm using my 'Rakusu Ring spreadsheet' as a foil for this project.
I received the course syllabus for 'ENGL 463 Geographies of Nonfiction', which has a hybrid writing and literature structure. I've started pouring the foundation in my ZK for this 20-week project: nine books, a dozen short stories, and a half dozen writing assignments. I started reading a couple of weeks ago, but now I must pour gas on the fire and read a lot.
Refactored my Keyboard Maestro note templates. I simplified them and made them more broadly applicable.
My current plans for this coming week:
Class starts on the 23rd, and I have seven more books to read in preparation. Lots of reading ahead with little time for zettelkasting.


When I'm procrastinating class work/reading, I'll be reading:



Here are a few of the titles and one-sentence summaries of zettel I created last week.
I'm excited about "Literate Programming," Donald Knuth's thesis on this programming paradigm has arrived at the library on interlibrary loan. I'll pick it up on Tuesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like Steve Purcell's SanityInc Tomorrow themes, but would like something between night and bright.
 I copied emacs/.local/elpa/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-20220412.1643/sanityinc-tomorrow-night-theme.el and ./emacs/.local/elpa/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-20220412.1643/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow.el to ~/.config/doom/themes and added my- to each. I then added a color definition I called dusk to my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow.el:
  69c69,82 < '((night . ((background . "#1d1f21") --- > '((dusk . ((background . "#1d1f21") > (alt-background . "#151515151515") > (current-line . "#2a2a2a") > (selection . "#424242") > (foreground . "#eaeaea") > (comment . "#969896") > (red . "#d54e53") > (orange . "#e78c45") > (yellow . "#e7c547") > (green . "#b9ca4a") > (aqua . "#70c0b1") > (blue . "#7aa6da") > (purple . "#c397d8"))) > (night . ((background . "#1d1f21") 1651c1664 < (defun color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow (mode) --- > (defun my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow (mode) 1676a1690,1695 > (defun color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-dusk () > "Apply the tomorrow dusk theme." > (interactive) > (my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow 'dusk)) > 
 And created this my-sanityinc-tomorrow-dusk-theme.el:  (add-load-path! "/Users/aqjo/.config/doom/themes") (require 'my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow) (color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-dusk) 
 Despite my having defined it as shown above, the latest error I'm getting is Symbol's function definition is void: color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-dusk.
 I feel like I might be making this more difficult than it needs to be. Is there a simple way to define a theme with the colors I want without all the intricacies that are in this set of themes?
 In fact, I might use afternoon or dark+ if I could make the alt-background (I think it is) more prominent.
 Thanks

 Why on earth are these function signatures different? 😭 
 You could simply keep the signatures exactly the same for both, without affecting the function body, nor the output. But having different signatures means if you swap from using a foldr to a foldl, you have to swap your own function that it calls too. 
 I don't see the point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am most sure that I am not using correct terms while asking this question because I don't even know what the correct terms are. Maybe you can help as you read my question.
 I have encountered so many hooks in Emacs for different types buffers. Like ielm-mode-hook, term-mode-hook, text-mode-hook, prog-mode-hook. Sure there must be many more.
 While disabling or enabling some features using these hooks I am never sure if I have enabled or disabled it on all the hooks.
 Like I want to add line numbers to any "text non-I/O" buffers. By this mean only buffers where I write text or code but do not run REPL or any interactive tools. Are text-mode-hook and prog-mode-hook enough? Am I missing some other hooks?
 What if I want to add some function to "interactive I/O" buffers like REPLs, terminals, or other interactive tools? Like if I have line numbers enabled by default but I want to disable them in interactive buffers like this, is it enough to hook that function to term-mode-hook and ielm-mode-hook? Am I missing any other hooks?
 Is there a full list of hooks somewhere? At least the built-in ones? Is there some categorizing of those hooks like these ones are just for writing text and these ones are for interactive buffers?

 I have corfu and cape and none of them contain any of those keywords:
  (use-package corfu :init (global-corfu-mode) :custom (corfu-auto t) (corfu-cycle t) (corfu-auto-prefix 1) (corfu-auto-delay 0.1) (corfu-quit-no-match 'separator) (corfu-excluded-modes '(org-mode mu4e-compose-mode))) (use-package cape :init (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-dabbrev) (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-file)) 
 I don't think corfu is something I need right when Emacs starts up so I think it is safe to defer both corfu and cape manually with :defer t right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My note: Selection functions are interesting notion with tricky implementation
 The notion of selection functions is simple: scala type J[R, A] = (A => R) => A  We have the evaluation function A => R that tells how to judge an object. And we receive back "the best" object (possible options are embodied).
 The topic is being actively researched. And papers are not simple sometimes to start from scratch. I tried to make an introduction that will help to do the first steps.
 For instance, it was not so easy to understand (and implement, for sure) product to combine selections: ```scala def product[R, A]: List[J[R, A]] => J[R, List[A]] =
 (functions: List[J[R, A]]) =>
 (listEval: List[A] => R) =>
 functions match {
 case evalFun :: restEvalFunctions =>
 val a: A =
 evalFun((candidate: A) =>
 listEval(
 candidate ::
 product
 .apply(restEvalFunctions)
 .apply(
 restCandidates =>
 listEval(candidate :: restCandidates)
 )
 )
 ) 
  val as: List[A] = product(restEvalFunctions)(rest => listEval(a :: rest)) a :: as case Nil => Nil } 
 ```
 And the product is really useful. Playing games (like chess) or graph searches ofter really represent picking some "best" state.
 I hope somebody will find it useful.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to add a bunch of php files that are in a directory into an org document as separate code blocks. This is what I want to achieve:
 #+begin_src html :tangle "/sudo::/srv/http/01.php" <?php // code of 01.php ?> #+end_src #+begin_src html :tangle "sudo::/srv/http/02.php" <?php // code of 02.php ?> #+end_src 
 The idea is to have an org document with the php code imbedded. Then it is easy to create the website from one org document by running org-babel-tangle. Right now I'm using a bash code block to create results:
 #+name: php-files #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output cd $HOME/Downloads/; for f in *; do echo "#+begin_src html :tangle '/sudo::/srv/http/$f'" paste /dev/null - < "$f" #pukes out php content of file echo "#+end_src" echo "" done #+end_src #+RESULTS: php-files #+begin_example ,#+begin_src html :tangle '/sudo::/srv/http/01.php' <?php // code of 01.php ?> ,#+end_src ,#+begin_src html :tangle '/sudo::/srv/http/02.php' <?php // code of 01.php } ?> #+end_example 
 This output is almost what I want. Except the comma prefixes (default behavior of code blocks ) and single quote instead of double quote. (the double quotes can be generated by the bash script. I will figure this out later).
 At the moment I am using a keyboard macro to remove the , and overwrite ' with ". This can also be done by evil mode. My question is if there are other ways to create these code block outputs? Preferably the code should be part of the org document, to make the document portable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I have a stream of data which is mostly sensor readings, and would like to make a Haskell program to visualize those readings in real time. Some I would display in pretty much their raw value as text, some maybe in a bar graph, gauges probably... I'm not sure what exactly yet, and am happy to adjust to the library if worthwhile.
 Think of it as similar to a dashboard. No human input (mouse, keyboard...) present.
 The graphics library does not have to be super tailored for exactly that use case, if I have to come up with the "widgets" myself that's okay. But then it should have a reasonable set of drawing primitives, e.g. for boxes and rendering text.
 Direct output to framebuffer preferred, but if it only works under X it's not a dealbreaker. The output display is fixed resolution and the graphics would always be displayed full screen, so no real need for resizing or dynamic scale, distances and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I want to ask for some guidance/opinions.
 I’m currently a “Data Scientist” with a decade of experience in statistics, analytics, machine learning, etc. But lately I’ve been exploring the possibility of switching paths towards a more engineering kind of thing. At least for a while, I’d like something where I get to focus more on writing good, tested, maintainable, reusable code (things that are valued but not prioritized in DS). I feel that focusing on those things would make me a better professional even if I decide to come back to a DS/ML job later.
 And it would be great to be able to use more Scala and FP (something that I get to do only rarely in my area, since Python is lingua franca).
 I guess that Data Engineer would be the most feasible role to switch into, since there is some intersection/synergy with the job experience I already have… although maybe not that much...
 So my question is, based on your experience actually working as engineers… do you think this is feasible? Are there some areas that I should focus on strengthening before being able to attempt this? Would I have to start at a junior role, or is my experience in DS/ML pertinent enough for me to aspire to a higher seniority?
 I know that this is pretty unorthodox, but hell, if it makes me enjoy my day to day work even more, then I think it’s worth considering. I just want to know how realistic this all is :P

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I want to create org headings that have these two properties attached:
 * Heading :PROPERTIES: :Created: [2022-08-13 Sat 23:41] :Modified: [2022-08-13 Sat 23:52] :END: Content of heading .. .. 
 Having these allow me to sort notes and stuff by recent modification date if I ever need.
 I just don't know how to automate the updating of the :modified: field. Let's say my cursor is inside the heading. I need something that searches backwards and updates the first occurence of :modified: and updates it with current date and time.
 I was wondering if anyone knows a package that offers such functionality?

 I'm curious: I know that there exist many exporting features to sync org-mode agendas as calendar files (.ics etc...) to view your agenda in a calendar GUI. However, what I'm curious about (and wish to find) is a package which displays your org-mode agenda in an org table calendar? So that you don't have to export anything. It would all be displayed in an emacs buffer with a table layout and links to agenda events? Does this exist?
 I figured since I'm doing almost everything in emacs now for organization, why not include a calendar view as well?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Software monoliths are sort of an older way of building software, and making things small and single purpose has been Linux wisdom the Unix Philosophy that is usually right. Emacs is the biggest threat to hypocrisy here, since it can itself be considered a huge monolith that does everything. Aside from that, however, there are other remarkable monoliths (giant pieces of software with huge code-bases and broad functionality) in the emacs ecosystem, some of which are so big and established and useful that they are hard to replace. What are some of your favorites, and what do they do that is hard to replace for you?
 Here are some of mine:
  
Org-mode. It's breadth is actually part of its value-proposition with literate programming in many languages, publication to a plethora of outputs, and rich note-taking (code notebook-style) to an extent unreached by any other tool of which I'm aware. Plus it's really good for actually taking tech/class notes.
 Gnus. Letting me easily* do email across many addresses in emacs, and integrating well with the related monolith...
 BBDB. It has great support for all manner of contacts and, apparently, all sorts of exports, with prevalent and rich interfaces.
 Helm. Really a swiss-army knife of completion, but there have been a plethora of lighter more specific altervatives in the past few years. Nonetheless, my students loved the ease and "do it all" made possible by Helm.

 I also have Emacs set to save the file when the frame is out of focus, but I think the two shouldn't collide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scala is a great programming language for data related tasks. A good, Arrow-backed, dependency free DataFrame library would be a great way to make Scala even better for data programming. Spark is great for big data, but Scala would benefit from having a DataFrame library for small data tasks as well.
 I'll quote one of the commentors in a recent thread I created: "The real problem is that we have no simple alternative for Pandas and numpy"
 I'd be happy to collaborate with someone on this effort if you're interested. I am a dev advocate and am already working with the creators of Polars and DataFusion, two Rust based DataFrame libraries, to help them grow their projects. Interested if the community thinks this is a good idea. I don't have the coding skills to build an Arrow-based Scala DataFrame lib myself, but would be happy to help out with the project evangelism.

 Currently I have the following in my init.el:
 elisp (require 'org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "/path/to/config.org")) 
 My whole configuration resides in a single, separate org file, including the early-init part (which is tangled to a separate early-init.el file in user-emacs-directory).
 Whilst this mostly works fine, this approach gives me issues when I try to use the latest version of org-mode via straight.el. I believe this is caused by the fact that I'm loading the built-in org version in init.el, and then trying to load/use an updated version in config.org (which causes some void variable errors for me).
 Alternative strategies are to put something like (load-file "config.el") in init.el, and tangle config.org manually or on save.
 Just curious how you all are using your literate org config file, and whether there is anyone who was able to solve/avoid the issue with org that I'm having (I could stick to the built-in version, but I would like to be able to use the latest version).

 I have been searching for good category theory books because I read that category theory can help you understand Haskells type system.
 ​
 So I was wondering if any of you can point to any books or papers where I can learn category theory and about Haskells type system and their intersection. thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I transitioned to (vanilla) Emacs two months ago, after using Vim for the last 8 years or so---I'm loving it!
 I also forced myself out of the comfort zone and practiced plain Emacs keybinding, and I'm quite comfortable with it.
 However, the only thing I miss from (Neo)vim as an ex-vimmer is C-o and C-i to jump back and forth.
 I found this better-jumper package and tried to use it: emacs-lisp (use-package better-jumper :ensure t :init (better-jumper-mode 1) :config (define-key input-decode-map "\\C-i" \[C-i\]) :bind (("C-o" . 'better-jumper-jump-backward) ("C-i" . 'better-jumper-jump-forward)))  But it doesn't seem to automatically record positions. For instance, I want to move back to where I was after I C-M-. via C-o.
 Is there a way to automatically do this without full-fledged Doom emacs or evil-mode?
 I'm fine with cherry-picking only this feature from evil-mode, btw.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 Yes, this is another post about someone switching editors. I know, there are a lot, but I think those are important because that kind of posts drove my decisions in the past.
 I move constantly between editors (Vim => Emacs => Neovim => Emacs => Neovim => Vscode (1 day) => Neovim => ...). The only thing that is nonnegotiable is modal editing.
 Last time I switched from Emacs because of the **huge** amount of time it takes to open (no, I do not like emacsclient). IIRC, it was taking 8s to start in my machine. Hence, I migrate to Neovim and Lua.
 Neovim is a fantastic project! Lua will bring it to a new level! However, I started to miss a GUI and some polished tools I had in Emacs. All GUIs in Neovim are almost a terminal in a graphical application. It really does not add something new. Furthermore, since Lua integration is relatively new, I often find some rough edges. 99% can be fixed relatively easily. However, I just do not have time anymore to tweak my configuration as I had back in the day.
 So, I heard about gccemacs and tried again. WOW! That's a game changer!
 After 20 min compiling everything shipped with Doom emacs by default (yes, this is the bad side of the tradeoff), Emacs starts in less than 2s. It is even faster than my Neovim with all plugins. So, if anyone quit Emacs because of performance, give it one more try. Just do not mind the initial compilation time...
 Finally, I just want to thanks the amazing job of u/hlissner, Doom Emacs is amazing and you can use it out-of-the-box. Exactly what I need now.

 (defun fzf-or-find-file () (interactive) (if (equal current-prefix-arg nil) (find-file) (fzf-find-file))) 
 This works with C-u M-x fzf-or-find-file (the fzf version runs), but when I DON'T pass a Ctrl-u, find-file ... fails. I'm sure I'm calling it incorrectly here, but pointers welcome.
 The failure looks like this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ideally, I'd like to get credentials (e.g. for API endpoints) from my environment when developing in python. However Emacs doesn't see them (I don't run it from terminal).
 Now there is the package exec-path-from-shell that loads the PATH variable and that's nice and dandy. But I need other variables (possibly dozens of APIs for different projects). 
 Is there any reasonable way to do it?
 Thank you!

If i remember correctly, some common lisp implementations already compile lisp to machine code (like sbcl). Since elisp and common lisp are both in the same family, i was wondering how difficult would it be to compile the elisp libraries in emacs into common lisp, load them into an sbcl image, and obtain emacs with native compilation built in. 
 This could be further interfaced with other common lisp projects like Nyxt to provide further functionality. Would something like this be feasible?

 I'm approaching middle age and have always tried to use ergonomic tools & techniques and yet I am developing RSI. My right hand is particularly bad. I have an appointment with my doctor to have a chat about it, but I am pretty sure that contorting my thumbs/hands in general to hit the meta/ctrl/shift keys have not helped me.
 I have enjoyed some modal editing in my journey. My current favorite packages for that are Meow & god-mode. I honestly have not decided which I like better but both "de-chord" my commands. Meow does this with a "keypad" mode that is for all intents and purposes a leader key. This adds 1 additional key press in exchange for no modifiers. Meow has better text navigation, overall god-mode reduces key-presses much more dramatically.
 I am also considering learning/training myself to use both hands at all times and avoid pressing 2 keys with one hand at any given time. This only gets dicey with 3 key chords (like C-M-/M-S-/C-S/-).
 I'm trying to get a sense of which is the best course of action here. Heck, maybe I should do both?
 EDIT: You all have been amazing. Thank you so much for the advice! If I did not manage to respond to you please know that I am grateful

With this in mind, I've been updating my linking practices.
Are you approaching linking casually as an afterthought?
I already have a summary (subatomic) and I could optionally add a "Link Solidifier" in () directly after the link.

  
Example

These are similar, but the subatomic summary is statically created when the zettel was created, and the "Link Solidifier" is more dynamic when the connection is created.



I have lots of thoughts about the value and practice of linking ideas. I want to start the discussion somewhere. What are your ideas? How do you work with the different types of links? It's funny that we have hundreds of note types but a slim taxonomy of links.
Experiment! Let me know what you think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Emacs mostly for research in the humanities. Linking to PDFs, storing notes, annotating documents, and writing and editing documents. 
 I think my key packages are pdf-tools, org mode, org-roam, org-transclusion, org-remark, and org-roam-bibtex with citar. I use straight.el + use-package to manage my packages.
 I do a lot of my reading Zotero and then export stuff to Emacs, but I'd be interested in moving more to Emacs too. 
 Currently using selectrum, but I hear that's being phased out in favour of vertico. I've liked prescient and I believe there's a hack to use it with vertico. I have consult installed too, although I haven't used marginalia or corfu yet. Interested in using them though!
 Any other cool packages that might work for my use case of finding documents, writing documents, and displaying connections between them?
 Or just quality of life improvement stuff? E.g. Zotero or Firefox integration, better buffer management, better scrolling, UI stuff.
 I've heard a lot of great things about evil, so interested in adding that to my init, but I've never used vim by itself. Any cool guides to getting started with evil that don't assume vim knowledge? 
 And what additional elements of the evil ecosystem should I add? I can't tell the difference between org-evil and evil-org.

 I'm working on a project at the moment looking at setting up SAST/DAST security scanning where I work, and one language I need to support is Scala. Now, I'm a security engineer, not a software dev, and I don't know a jot about Scala. I've heard some noise around Scala being a secure-by-default language thanks to it's type safety, which I don't totally buy (that is, I see how that could make it secure in terms of input validation, but security doesn't just come down to input validation!) 
 Anyways that said, I have a couple of questions:
  
Can you point to me to any resources around secure software development for Scala specifically?
 Have any of you got any experience in using SAST tools like Semgrep, Snyk Code, Codacy, Checkmarx, etc? If so, can you tell me about that? Likes, dislikes, was it useful, etc?
  
​
 What I absolutely want to avoid is ending up rolling something out that ultimately wastes dev time and pisses people off :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I would like to ask whether it is possible to speed up the first GTK3 frame creation (not `init.el` loading)
 Background: Emacs 28.1 with GTK3 on ArchLinux (Awesome WM) and Ubuntu 20.04 (Gnome 3.36), both with Xorg. The config is on GitHub. On both machines the startup time for a non daemon Emacs UI instance is roughly the same and fluctuates between 0.46-0.55 seconds (depending on machine load perhaps, not sure), measured by `emacs-init-time`. The same measurement when opening a frame created from daemon (by `systemd`, but it shouldn't matter) or in terminal is 0.104 sec. When using `emacs -Q` it is 0.319 sec.
 So, although the startup times are fine, I anyway would like to find a way to lessen the time it takes to draw a GTK3 frame which is roughly 0.3 sec. as far as I understand (this is by simply calculating the difference between non-daemon UI init time and a daemon one). 
 Why? Because I want it faster and because the frame flickers when it is drawn :)
 So, basically this is not about the speed of `init` loading, but UI drawing (although I will gladly accept suggestions to speed up the init as well [the config is in the works, I choose not to use `use-package`, but instead to employ manual tweaks]).
 Is it even possible to lessen this time? By the measurement of `-Q` it seems not...
 Thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've started putting together a typeclass for differences in my current project. The simple example would be UTCTime and NominalDiffTime from Data.Time. The general structure that I have at the moment is
 -- | A type where we can reify changes class Diffable base where -- | The type of the changes type Metric base -- | Find the change between two values diff :: base -> base -> Metric base -- | Update a value with a set of changes move :: base -> Metric base -> base instance Diffable UTCTime where type Metric UTCTime = NominalDiffTime diff = diffUTCTime move = flip addUTCTime 
 with a couple of laws
 move old (diff new old) = new diff (move old path) old = path 
 with the additional conditions for when Metric base is a Monoid.
 (diff a b) <> diff(b c) = diff a c diff a a = mempty 
 I've searched for something like this in the past, but never found it. However, I'm not a clever person, so I fully expect that I might have missed something. Alternately, perhaps there's a fundamental flaw with this abstraction that will come back to bite me? As it stands, my current project requires reifying the changes in a deeply nested structure and being able to create Diffable instances for the container classes has vastly simplified my code.

Spellchecking of by default.

 Switching between languages English and German
 Choose between suggested corrections
 Save "new" words
  
As and addon it would be nice but doesn't have to: - Use German and English in the same buffer at the same time - Spell check docstrings in Python code
 Sidenote: I am not sure if this is relevant but in Python I use eglot as LSP which checks my code (via flycheck8 or flymake8 or something with fly...).
 Sidenote2: In some web source I saw that ivy and custom also are relevant here. I use both of them in my init.el.
 Sidenote3: 95% of time I use Emacs in terminal via SSH and not in gui mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According tothe docs, the c source files generate an executable called temacs which is just the lisp interpreter plus IO routines. This then loads the lisp libraries which provide the full emacs experience. The manual then says that temacs dumps some files according to the shell arguments it received.
 If it received pdump, it dumps an exact copy of itself plus the recorded routines from the lisp libraries it loaded (into a file called emacs.pdump).
 If it received dump, it dumps an executable lisp image of itself with all the lisp libraries already loaded.
 It would make sense to me that the 2nd option is the one used to distribute emacs via package managers, but according to the docs, this option is deprecated. 
 Does this mean that when i apt install emacs, I am installing the exact copy of temacs + an emacs.pdump file?
 Also, if using "pdump" the dumped executable is an exact copy of temacs, could I stop the build process right after the C source has compiled and use temacs as a bare bones emacs (maybe load the lisp libraries myself)?
 Im not planning to do this, im just curious about the mechanics of the process.

 If anyone wants to take a look and tell me what I did wrong/unidiomatically, I'd appreciate it. If not, thanks for reading anyway. I was trying to get it done quick(ish) rather than pretty, but it seems decent, and it works, which is neat.

 dvips: DVI file can't be opened: _region_.dvi: No such file or directory DviPS sentinel: Opening input file: No such file or directory 
 However, when I run the command a second time, it works fine. I imagine that maybe there is some race condition where we are requesting info from a file that has not been created yet, but which is created by the time I re-run the command. Has someone else run into this error who can help me diagnose it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to use Org-mode HTML export with Liquid tags which has been set up by my team. The final exported html should be something like this:
 {% extends 'base.html' %} {% load static %} {% block content %} <div class="blah"> ...blah ... </div> {% endblock %} 
 Now, I can easily use #+begin_export html in the beginning of my file to include the header tags. However, I'm unable to include the bottom liquid tag in the correct hierarchy, as Org export automatically adds a closing </div> after the included liquid tag. A minimal example:
 #+title: My website #+OPTIONS: toc:nil html-style:nil num:nil html-scripts:nil html-preamble:nil html-postamble:nil #+begin_export html {% extends 'base.html' %} {% load static %} {% block content %} #+end_export * Welcome to my website Welcome to my small website. * Contact us Some info on how to contact us. #+begin_export html {% endblock %} #+end_export 
 I know Org treats hierarchies strictly, so that is why perhaps the last html_export is added to the Contact Us section. Any ideas how to avoid that and keep this tag as the last output in the html? Thanks in advance!
 Edit : Solved, check comments!

In parallel, this post aims to illustrate a use case of Chainsail with an example of probabilistic clustering with soft k-means.
You will see that the Bayesian model discussed here exhibits a multimodal posterior distribution, and whereas single-chain MCMC algorithms notoriously struggle to correctly sample similar posteriors, we will show how Chainsail improves on that state of affairs.

Soft k-means clustering, also known as fuzzy clustering, is the probabilistic version of the better known k-means clustering.

 I was really excited to create a Jupyter notebook that showcases some Delta Lake functionality the other day.
 I had a nice workflow installing different Java versions using SDKMAN but switched to Coursier because that't what's recommended in the Almond installation guide. In order to run `jupter lab` and start up the notebook environment, I need to separately install Jupyter Lab via conda (and activate that conda environment).
 I'm a little stuck now because apparently Coursier doesn't let me download a version of Java that's optimized for the M1, see this issue.
 Let me know if you have any suggestions on the best way for me to setup my machine. It's awesome how much progress has been made on tooling in Scala.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to share this small package that I wrote based on /u/nicolas-rougier's code.
 It's a simple package that modifies messages so that additional text is appended and right-aligned. I use it to show information that I want to see regardless of the current buffer (in my case, time a notmuch email indicator and today's task statistics).
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/3u3ui7xfxvg91.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=0695895836722596efd543173adba170196b1de5
 You can use it as follows to show the time for example.
 (require 'echo-line) ;; Enable `display-time-mode` to update the `display-time-string` (display-time-mode 1) ;; Optionally delete the time string from the mode-line (delete 'display-time-string global-mode-string) ;; Update the echo-line every time the display-time is updated (add-hook 'display-time-hook 'echo-line-update) ;; Set the echo-line format (setq echo-line-format '((:eval display-time-string))) ;; Show the echo-line immediately (echo-line-mode) 
 The main changes from the original code is creating a global minor-mode, a slightly different way to right align text and other small checks to make sure that the messages are always displayed correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I've been a Haskell consultant for the past 3 years. Before that I have 4 years of .NET (with a bit of F# as well), so I'm pretty comfortable with both FP and OOP concepts.
 I absolutely love FP and Haskell, but there's so little work that it's frustrating. I have been "stuck" on the same project for 3 years now, which is getting pretty boring.
 Lately I've started considering switching to something more popular like Scala, as there's a much larger variety of projects and clients, but a call with a recruiter today confused me.
 I'm based in Europe and have a permanent contract at 450EUR day rate. The recruiter told me that transitioning to Scala would require a massive pay cut as no one would hire someone without production experience at that rate. He also said that usually Scala people's attitude towards Haskell developers is hostile.
 Does that statement have any merit? It sounds to me that he's just lacking technical understanding, but I don't know.
 What is your impression about that? How would you go about transitioning?

 Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite` type: a ~ [a] 
 Someone know why this compilation error happen?
 Thank you forehand
 Edit:
 I'm trying to implement a merge sort where a i have to split a list in to smaller pieces, which that i later merge:
 split [x] = [x] split lst = -- The length of the split depends if its odd or even. let half = if mod (length lst) 2 == 0 then div (length lst) 2 else div (length lst) 2 + 1 in [ split [ lst !! x | x <- [0,1..(half-1)]] , split [lst !! x | x <- [half..(length lst - 1)]] ]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I absolutely hate when my projects leave traces of the tools I use. My projects should contain the source code of the program, and anything required for it to function, or directly related with it, nothing else.
 Emacs doesn't seem to think the same. It litters the directory you're editing with backup and lock files, and I don't understand why.
 While I seem to have been successful in stopping backup files from popping up, I can't do the same with lock files. Despite setting the variable create-lockfiles to nil, it still creates them.
 Ideally, I'd want these lock files to exist, just somewhere else. They shouldn't be where I'm editing. I don't really know how to control, this. There was a variable to change that but I always failed at setting it, complaining I was using the wrong type.
 Anyway, this code is what I have at the very top of my init file, this is all I need to keep my working directory (and my config folder) clean from Emacs' shenanigans.
 (setq user-emacs-directory (expand-file-name "~/.local/share/emacs")) (setq user-config-directory (expand-file-name "~/.config/emacs")) (setq native-comp-eln-load-path '((. "~/.local/share/emacs/eln-cache"))) (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory)) (setq package-user-dir (expand-file-name "elpa" user-emacs-directory)) (setq url-history-file (expand-file-name "url/history" user-emacs-directory)) (setq delete-old-versions t) (setq create-lockfiles nil) (setq auto-save-list-file-prefix (expand-file-name "auto-save-list/.saves-" user-emacs-directory)) (setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.local/share/emacs/backups"))) 
 Does anybody know why Emacs STILL creates lock files where I'm editing? It's very annoying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using multi-term to manage multiple terminals. When I open a new term with M-x multi-term RET, the terminal is in char mode which is good.
 I execute a command in the terminal like this:
 echo hello world 
 Then I type C-p but nothing happens. I check C-h v term-bind-key-alist RET and it has this info:
 term-bind-key-alist is a variable defined in ‘multi-term.el’. Its value is shown below. The key alist that will need to be bind. If you do not like default setup, modify it, with (KEY . COMMAND) format. You can customize this variable. Value: (("C-c C-c" . term-interrupt-subjob) ("C-c C-e" . term-send-esc) ("C-p" . previous-line) ("C-n" . next-line) ("C-s" . isearch-forward) ("C-r" . isearch-backward) ("C-m" . term-send-return) ("C-y" . term-paste) ("M-f" . term-send-forward-word) ("M-b" . term-send-backward-word) ("M-o" . term-send-backspace) ("M-p" . term-send-up) ("M-n" . term-send-down) ("M-M" . term-send-forward-kill-word) ("M-N" . term-send-backward-kill-word) ("<C-backspace>" . term-send-backward-kill-word) ("M-r" . term-send-reverse-search-history) ("M-d" . term-send-delete-word) ("M-," . term-send-raw) ("M-." . comint-dynamic-complete)) 
 So by default C-p is bound to previous-line. So when I type C-p in terminal (which is in char mode), the cursor should move one line up? But nothing happens when I type C-p in the terminal.
 What good is the entry for ("C-p" . previous-line) in term-bind-key-alist then if C-p does nothing? Anyone savvy can help me to understand what the use of this entry is?

 I'd like to use the ryo-modal as a menu like hydra ...
 Do you use any packages to create menu where you can repeat the keys.
 Maybe the hydra is the best but the configuration is easier for ryo-modal :)

 I have a much improved version of Git Autosync, and would like to hear the opinions on the program and if you also find it useful. It's proven to be a reliable little helper, keeping a lot of my repos up to date daily, including dotfiles, knowledge base, and others.
 Feel free to create GitHub issues if you have ideas, or comment it here. You can also find a pre-packaged version of it for GNU/Linux systems and for macOS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just an FYI that we've tagged v1.0, which is us concluding that Citar is basically feature-complete, and we're comfortable with the API and keeping it more stable (sorry for the recent breaking changes!).
 Along with some major recent internal (in particular cache) and API changes, we've separated the embark-related code into a new package and minor-mode: citar-embark. I highly recommend it.
 Note: we do have a known performance issue apparent with large files that change frequently. The fix for this will mostly happen in parsebib.
 Also, I've updated the Doom biblio module to incorporate these changes, and updated all of its packages. This remains the easiest path to have a working citar-oriented system; just turn on the biblio and vertico modules, and set some paths.
 The note API in 1.0 in turn enables a small integration extension: citar-org-roam. This is partly a demo and test of the new API, but should also be useful for users, and developers that might want to build on it. This still needs a bit of work before I submit it to MELPA; PRs welcome.
 Any questions?

 (use-package org :ensure nil :hook (org-mode . (lambda () (org-indent-mode) (variable-pitch-mode -1) (display-line-numbers-mode -1) (set-input-method "custom-input-method"))) .. .. 
 The set-input-method loads some custom keys I defined to insert phonetic symbols:
 (quail-define-rules ;; Phonetic symbols ("\\uh" ?ə) ; UNSTRESSED SCHWA VOWEL ("\\uH" ?ʌ) ; STRESSED SCHWA VOWEL ("\\ii" ?ɪ) ; NEAR-CLOSE NEAR-FRONT UNROUNDED VOWEL ("\\uu" ?ʊ) ; NEAR-CLOSE NEAR-BACK ROUNDED VOWEL .. .. 
 I use these symbols quite often in my documents so I would like the input method to be enabled by default in Org mode which it works using the code above.
 I have two questions:
 When (set-input-method "custom-input-method") enables the custom input method does that have any negative side effect on the default input method? or the custom input method will just add the additional characters on top of the default input method?
 Is there a command to disable the custom input method while in Org mode? I don't think I will need to disable it but I'm just wondering.

I could do most of the exercises, but not all of them, and I could do almost nothing with the final project on graphics.
 Are the exercises just difficult? Is it a poorly regarded resource, or am I just slow to learn?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context:
 E is used to mark an article as expired in summary buffer. But if I press E by mistake, is there a way to undo just the Expiry mark.
 ​
 If I use ~gnus-summary-clear-mark-forward~, it clears all marks, but is there a way to clear only just the Expiry (E) mark?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been fighting with clangd for a couple weeks, which was a big disappointment. For years I saw these interesting plugins to help code completion completely pass me by because converting the project I was on into a format understandable by clang was a huge hassle.
 Well, now I'm working on an Unreal project, and its build steps let me create a compile_commands.json file that works with clangd. 
 But the compile_commands.json file is about 745MB, and I was getting constant blocking stalls in emacs. If I opened up the eglot events buffer, it was scrolling endlessly, presumably because of background generation of semantic data that would be used for all the interesting stuff that you want to use clangd for.
 Hunting around, I found mention of clangd-indexer, which creates a static index.

a web service called Chainsail that facilitates sampling multimodal probability distributions.
It is an effort to expand the applicability of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC), modern probabilistic programming tools — and, by extension, Bayesian inference — to more complex statistical problems.
Tweag provides the computing resources required by Chainsail (within reasonable limits) free of charge.
If you’re impatient, you can skip right to our walkthrough video where we demonstrate briefly what Chainsail does and how to use it.

 I would like to collect/export the results of the search (acting as a snapshot of my search state), and I would also like the embark export buffer to update. E.g. if I select a search result and change it so it no longer matches the search, it should no longer show in the buffer.
 ​
 Each time I've tried to use embark-act -> embark-live; the focus stays in the vertico search. I've fumbled and tried a few things to dismiss the search and work with the embark-live buffer but can't seem to figure that out.

 Any tips for what I'm doing wrong? (Does embark support this workflow?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I've written a new package to track down the correct Python executables from the various virtualenvs that you might create for your Python projects.
 In short, the motivation for this package is that modern Python projects typically rely on a bunch of linters and formatters, and they can all be installed in different virtualenvs. This package will find those installed in pre-commit, then poetry, and then finally whatever is on your exec-path, and then assign the absolute paths to many of the supported Emacs package variables.
 This package is in early preview, but it's perfectly usable for most situations by my estimate. If you run into any problems, please don't hesitate to file an issue on the repo.
 Also, if you have any idea writing tests for this package without having me creating all kinds of a fixtures or mocking dozens of things, please let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved from using vanilla ansi-term to using multi-term.
 One very nice feature about ansi-term was how I could press C-c C-j to change from term-char-mode to term-line-mode and then press C-c C-k again to come back to term-char-mode.
 After installing the C-c C-j command does not work anymore when I am in term-char-mode. I have to run M-x term-line-mode RET now to change to term-line-mode.
 How can I get back the C-c C-j behavior to change from term-char-mode to term-line-mode?

 As I understand, compiler can't do it generally, because there can be other instances of MonadState' s for ExceptT s m. But in this case I definitely know, they should not exist. Is there any way to tell compiler "for this class this is a single instance and you can add MonadState' s (ExceptT s m) => MonadState' s m to your inferred rules list"? As far as I see, there shouldn't be any problems with that for typechecking, so I hope this has already been realized. Or there are some problems that I can't forsee?
 Motivation: I try to make it possible to change, for example, type of error of transformer without decomposing whole monad. So, roughly speaking, I would like to have the function haskell mapError :: (MonadError e m, MonadError e' m', ???) => (e -> e') -> m -> m'  this can be done using type families (like MappedErrorMonad e e' m m') for errors only. But we have a problem when there is some state both at the left and right sides. So we want to tell compiler something like MappedErrorMonad e e' m m' => (MonadState s m => MonadState s m'). For this purpose I've introduced haskell class (forall m a. (Monad m, c' (t a m)) => c' (t b m)) => MappableSave (t :: * -> (* -> *) -> * -> *) (c' :: (* -> *) -> Constraint)  And now want to inhabit this class by ExceptT:  instance MappableSave ExceptT (MonadState s)  But compiler failed with error  • Could not deduce (S.MonadState s m) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: (Monad m, S.MonadState s (ExceptT a m)) bound by a quantified context  that's where my topic started

 This fails with the following error:

 Here is the definition of Env along with the setEnv function:
 -- | A wrapper over a Map to hold environment variables. newtype Env a = Env { runEnv :: Map String a } deriving Functor -- | Set a value in the provided environment. setEnv :: Env a -> String -> a -> Env a setEnv m k v = Env $ Map.insert k v (runEnv m)

So far I am still looking for which tool to use to build this system because TheArchive software is a MAC version only. By the way, if you may suggest a tool or a scenario to achieve the Zettelkasten system that would be awesome.
I've found some tools like Notion, Obsidian, iAWriter ...etc, and also found some other tools for doing flashcards like Anki which I would like to use as well within the system, and I am still confused between them to pick one and learn it to make the best use of it on the long run.
All opinions and recommendations are highly appreciated.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please tell the community what you've been working on and share your plans for your zettelkasting this week.
This past week found me doing:
On Friday, my ZK surpassed 700k words, and by the end of the month, it may surpass 3k zettel. I'm slowly developing a sense of progress.
      20220806 Zettelkasten Statistics
                    ★★★★★
        700803 Total word count
        11801 Total link count
        2905 Total zettel count
                    ★★★★★

I gave up on the "Full Screen" workflow. I couldn't get it working with my Keyboard Maestro macros. I was having no fun.
Discovered a minor bug in my favorite advanced search querying macro.
My current plans for this coming week:
I will work all out on a minor bug in my favorite advanced search querying macro. It likely will require some more Regular Expression pixy-dust.
Reading - The Narrow Road To The Deep North by Matsuo Basho - Travel Journal
Reading - The Book Of Form And Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki - Fiction
Here are a few of the titles of zettel I've been working on last week.
These, along with the migration of 55 #code-snippets, make last week a ZK-focused week. Looking back, it feels like I only spent maybe two open and enjoyably stimulating hours per day working in my ZK. By working, I mean bathing in mind-weather and writing.
Travel Writing and Philosophy


Cognitive Behaviorism


Zettelkasting


Poetry

 Was original post:
 I found an easy way to highlight, namely i convert a word to all capital letters, selecting and using `U` in emacs-doom, but is not enough i want to use different colors or highlights 
 Now, as I use a lot of themes( working in sunlight and darker environment) I would like to `toggle on and off` an highlight function that find all the capital letters (if are more than 2) so that i can show my highlights when i want see key words in a doc

 Emacs has treesitter integration via the tree-sitter package. I was using tree-sitter before on neovim and it really great. Well, I'm trying to set it up in emacs and it's pure frustration.
 I've installed the package, and it says that you should also install a language pack. Well, since I was already using treesitter before, then I prefer to not have to compile the language parsers twice, so I decided to unify it in a single directory for both neovim and emacs. Making the change on neovim was a piece of cake. On emacs, I pushed to the tree-sitter-load-path list, and it seems to work... kinda. If I manually call tree-sitter-require 'python for example, it does load the language parser, it even gets listed in tree-sitter-languages. However, it doesn't get enabled, the syntax is the same.
 The variable tree-sitter-language is not getting set. Apparently tree-sitter should map each language major mode to a tree-sitter parser, but it ain't doing it for some reason. Trying to enable treesitter on a python file results in the error "No language registered for "python-mode"".
 Also what about these major modes for each language? I don't want a major mode for each language. I want emacs to open a file, recognize what it is by its extension or otherwise, and that's it. I want highlighting to be handled by treesitter, but it apparently needs to interact with these major modes (of which I need to install more if I want to support other languages) that don't really add anything to me other than bloat. Is there a workaround?

 Is there any way to get graceful filtering to help filter out typos? basically something like vscode's filterGraceful.
 I'm ok with switching from ivy to something else like helm as well.

 PMID:39334129 | DOI:10.1207/s12102-021-03242-8
 I wanted to call a function that records the entry into my .bib file and at the same time downloads the PDF of that paper if available using my python function. I cannot seem to do these two actions in a single function so I have to use two functions (one for PMID to get the pdf and other for DOI to get entered into .bib file) which work fine separately:
 (defun extract-PMID-DOI (regexp) (interactive (list (read-regexp "Regexp: "))) (isearch-mode t t) (let ((isearch-regexp nil)) (isearch-yank-string regexp))) (defun fetch-pubmed-pdf () (interactive) (extract-PMID-DOI "PMID:") ;; puts cursor on PMID number (insert (shell-command-to-string (concat "python3 /home/user/fetch_pdfs.py -out /home/user/papers/pdfs/ -pmids " (current-word)))) ) (defun fetch-pubmed-doi () (interactive) (extract-PMID-DOI "DOI:10.") ;; puts cursor on DOI number (doi-utils-add-bibtex-entry-from-doi (concat "10." (current-word)) "~/papers/ref.bib") ) 
 I wanted to know if there is a way for me to combine the two functions fetch-pubmed-pdf and fetch-pubmed-doi into a single function and also if there is a way to link the pdf that was downloaded in my /home/user/papers/pdfs/ to the .bib entry obtained from the doi?

 I have all setup so that a makefile compiles a latex file and creates a pdf. I also setup pdf-tools and synctex. I would like to bind to a key a functions that start to compile, wait for the result, if there is no error from make then it displays in a separate buffer the pdf, else it displays the buffer with the error (which are on stdout because I redirect them and grep the important bits).
 The makefile is important because there are other scripts that modify the latex before actual rendering. It also makes the setup more friendly with only the terminal.
 My experience with lisp is unfortunately very small, any suggestions for resources to read are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I only started using emacs a few days ago, but after getting over hating it for the first day or two, I learned how to do basic things from memory, like install packages, open text files, and use custom themes. I'm a fan now.
 I'd like to set it up to do the sorts or things an IDE would do, but the way I'm doing it doesn't quite have the functionality I'm looking for.
 Currently what I'm doing is opening a buffer with a text file, saving it as "somefile.c" (because I mainly work in C), and using the C major mode by typing "M-x c-mode." That implements syntax highlighting, which is nice, but there's a few things it doesn't do that I'd like it to do:
  
debugging/error correction - At the moment, if I type something like
 include <stdio.h
 
 it doesn't notice my dumb typo, and I'd prefer if it had some kind of feature to tell me what was wrong, rather than just getting a compilation error when I try to compile it. 
  
real time terminal - Ideally, I'd like to open a window with a separate buffer containing a terminal emulator so that I can compile+execute the code within emacs. 
  
Also, if anyone has configured their emacs so that it can be used as an IDE and has found some features helpful, I'd be interested in hearing about them!
 (N.B. I also work in Haskell. I'm having similar issues with the Haskell mode that I'm having with the C mode)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I started using helm and I like it and can already feel its power. But there are two difficulties I am not getting solved.
 1) Is it possible to turn off the display of the full path and just show the base filename in Recentf and Files-from-the-current-directory in my helm-mini-buffer? I know it is done in helm-find-files, but I cannot find a way to turn off the path when using the former two.
 2) Helm-recentf and helm-find-files use icons, which I like, because it helps me find the right file quick and at a glance. Files-from-the-current-directory doesn't show the icons. I would love to have it consistent, as I have both in a helm-mini-buffer, Recentf and Current-directory. Do you know a way to achieve this?
 Thank you so much for any advice!
 Best regards
 Titus

 The cool thing is if you enable other languages/config, for example rest client package `rest`, then the org babel package `ob-rest` will be automatically included.
 Here are my top 3 favorite list of flags:
  
+dragndrop: Enable drag-and-drop support for images and files;
 +pretty: Enables pretty unicode symbols for bullets and priorities, and better syntax highlighting for latex. 
 +roam2: Enables org-roam v2

 After looking at the info it seems that there is some conflict between cl and cl-lib and having both installed seems to the problem.
 The conclusion for me is that although cl-pushnew is defined in cl-lib the loading of cl seemed to void it in some way.
 Every now and then I get a warning that I should use cl is deprecated. How do I get rid of it? I don't think I have require'd it in my own code, but other libraries seem to depend on it.
 Info on pushnew
 pushnew is an alias for ‘cl-pushnew’ in ‘cl.el’. (pushnew X PLACE [KEYWORD VALUE]...) Add X to the list stored in PLACE unless X is already in the list. PLACE is a generalized variable that stores a list. Like (push X PLACE), except that PLACE is unmodified if X is ‘eql’ to an element already in the list stored in PLACE.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When newcomers begin with their first steps in Scala, for example building a simple rest API, they're guided towards the Typelevel ecosystem, http4s or similar. While Scala itself is an advanced language that takes time to learn, adding functional programming on top of that is unbearable for like 99% of newcomers. Doesn't seem like the Scala community embraces the standard Scala anymore, which makes this language for the "elite" only. Back in the day, Akka was sold a silver bullet to all problems and the overhead of complexity wasn't worth it for most. It seems like those pure functional libraries have the same problem, they have an even bigger overhead of complexity. It would be nice to have an ecosystem of standard Scala libraries that don't try to enforce a different style of programming and they will be the standard goto for newcomers. Otherwise, it seems like Scala will continue to decline in popularity since newcomers are not able to absorb the complexity of purely functional programming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, Ive been using ivy for a while now, and its been blooming smooth sailing. One thing i havent figured out though is how to prioritize specific completions; my search-fu is failing me here. What i want is to be able to provide a list of interactive functions (I only need this for executing extended commands) that, should they be in the list of completions, should be placed first in the completion list. For example, currently if i type in sly connect, the function sly-connect isnt first, that honor goes to sly-list-connections. As there ⠀isnt any way to narrow down completion to just sly-connect without replacing the space with a hyphen, i have to add it to the list of functions i have to type literally. So, is there any way to prioritize certain completions? Or, do you have other recommendations for how to solve this issue without needing to remember specific functions? Thanks!

 I also have a repo for ryo leader keys that are similar to doom emacs, and my modified kakoune.el.
 I only have written lisp for a brief time, so these packages could probably be improved on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I've freed my Cmd key to be used as Super, I would like to build code with s-b.
 project-compile does a good job, but it's interactive, and using it programmatically doesn't seem to be an option.
 Unless there's some weird overrides?
 Either way, I've copied and pasted the command to be non-interactive:
 (defun ct/project-compile (command) "Run `compile' non-interactively in the project root with `command'." (let ((default-directory (project-root (project-current t))) (compilation-buffer-name-function (or project-compilation-buffer-name-function compilation-buffer-name-function))) (compile command))) 
 I'm then using it thus:
 (defun ct/swift-build-command () (interactive) (ct/project-compile "swift build")) (define-key swift-mode-map (kbd "s-b") #'ct/swift-build-command) 
 (Could also use a lambda, but I don't mind the named function.)
  
How would you approach this? 
  
Not use (compile "swift build"), but drop down another level and use (compilation-start "swift build") directly?
 Locally let-override compile-command to be the command I want, e.g. "swift build"?

 (setq-custom python-shell-interpreter "C:/ProgramData/Anaconda3/Scripts/jupyter.exe") (setq-custom python-shell-interpreter-args "console --simple-prompt") (setq python-shell-completion-native-enable nil) 
 but then I get
 Error executing Jupyter command 'console': [WinError 5] Access is denied 
 So I run Emacs in Administrator mode, but then I can't work with matplotlib.pyplot interactively because I think it's using a temporary graphics directory that is not anticipated by the Administrator account. 
 Anyone know how to fix it, or have it working another way? Or I wonder if switching to eglot or lsp-mode is better. According to this post, it's better to stick with language modes in Emacs if they exist and use the language server only for those that don't.
 Edit in case this isn't the case with everyone, using a regular python or ipython shell causes python to freeze when I generate plots wit the matplotlib.pyplot library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a data pipeline that does not use spark. A major challenge is debugging and replaying data. 
 I have buy in to refactor the data pipeline so that’s each steps inputs are serializable. I don’t really have bug-in to make everything truly spark based.
 My understanding is that spark works by essentially serializing objects and distributing them. It can even deal with functions (I’m aware of the memory consequences of poorly thinking about closure). 
 Would it be possible (relatively easy) to serialize instances of classes (steps in my data pipeline) to disk, and then build a test framework that deserializes those classes and allows me to debug and step through them later?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I'm very new to emacs and I wanted to try some of the tools available. I saw it has an ebook reader called nov (which seems to be the only maintained one) so I gave it a shot. I immediately noticed some issues with the rendering of the document. Here's a side by side of the exact same position in the book, rendered by nov on the left, and by zathura on the right, this is not a PDF, it's an epub file: https://i.imgur.com/KcYblln.png
 Notice the complety lack of formatting on the first paragraph, or rather, at all. I don't think I need to point out the problems, they are pretty clear on their own.
 How can I fix this? Is it even possible to fix it?
 This is all the configuration I have for nov:
 (setq nov-text-width 60) (setq visual-fill-column-center-text t) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.epub\\'" . nov-mode)) 
 I don't really know how to extend it to be honest, or anything at all. I understand very basic elisp (like function calls and setting variables) but that's it. I do have plenty of programming experience, I just don't know elisp well enough yet.
 I've searched through the internet but there's very few results, and the few there were kinda went over my head. Any help is appreciated, thanks.

They have support for Ruby On Rails, Javas, C# .etc and it's just a simple config change to get the whole thing wired up. DataDog provides some instruction on how to build our own span and add monitor where we need in codes but we just don't have the bandwidth to take on another tool we have to build.
 Perhaps, I might have missed something but it shouldn't be this hard to find an APM solution similar to what New Relic or DataDog offer for Haskell. Any suggestions, guys?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm looking for a 6 month unpaid internship with a company using Haskell (or Purescript or Elm) in production. The reason that I'm specifying that it be unpaid is that I'm doing it through the DoD Skillbridge program, which allows separating military servicemembers to intern with a private company for six months prior to the end of their contract. 
 I have a background in web development using Rails and a little React/Node, and I've been learning Haskell in my spare time. I've begun reaching out to companies that are already postured to work with Skillbridge interns, but I'm most excited about working in Haskell. 
 Do you have any suggestions about where I can find companies that would like to have a ~junior Haskell programmer and can support good quality mentorship? That company would have to register with the program but it's genuinely not difficult, just a bit slow.
 Edit: I would be available to start in May 2023; when a company signs up for the program, it can take 90-120 days to be approved, thus the lead time. I am a US citizen (in the US) but can relocate anywhere or work remotely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've been a long time user of Ivy and Counsel but a couple of days ago I decided to give Vertico, Embark and Consult a try. I'm very joyful with them so far, however I'm having a couple of issues: - 1. I've read that using Embark to collect a list of grep results should result in a grep-mode buffer. I used to use Ivy to produce an occur buffer which I could then edit allowing me to make changes across multiple files easily. Getting a grep-mode buffer sounded good to me as I could then use wgrep to edit these‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­matches directly in a similar way. However, when I collect these results (via embark-collect-live, embark-collect-snapshot or embark-export) I always end up with an embark-collect-mode buffer. I cannot see a way from here to make this a grep-mode buffer or to make changes to these matches in the same way I would in an editable occur buffer. 2. In the collected results as mentioned in the first question, if I press RET on any of these results I get the following error: Error running timer ‘consult--async-after-change’: (buffer-read-only #<buffer *Embark Collect*>). I'm currently using Emacs 28.0.50 and I use Evil mode. Any help on the above would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like the idea of only horizontally scrolling the current line, ie. (setq auto-hscroll-mode 'current-line), but it has a few quirks.
 First, if you scroll to the end of a long line, and then move to the next line, it will horizontally scroll that line, even if it easily fits on the screen. This pushes most of the short line off the left edge of the screen.
 Second, It would be nice for point to stay as far right as possible (at the left edge of the right margin) when horizontally scrolling. This would make it so point would stay a few columns from the right edge the entire time the line is horizontally scrolled. So even when moving point left, the line under point would horizontally scroll to the right until the line is no longer horizontally scrolling, then point would actually start moving toward the left edge of the screen.
 Does anyone know of such a thing? or can anyone help point me in the right direction to create a minor mode that would do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am tasked with writing a functor instance for the MyList type defined below, leaving its original structure as is.
 data MyList a = Elem a (MyList a) | Null (MyList a) | Done deriving Show 
 This is what I tried doing, by following this StackOverflow guide https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55191289/haskell-custom-functor-instance-on-data-type-with-function-constructor:
 instance Functor MyList where fmap f (Elem x xs) = Elem x xs fmap f (Null x) = Null x fmap f (Done) = Done 
 But this gives these errors:
 Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘b’
 ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
 the type signature for:
 fmap :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> MyList a -> MyList b
 at Main.hs:66:3-6
 ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
 the type signature for:
 fmap :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> MyList a -> MyList b
 at Main.hs:66:3-6
 Expected type: MyList b
 Actual type: MyList a
 • In the expression: Elem x xs
 In an equation for ‘fmap’: fmap f (Elem x xs) = Elem x xs
 In the instance declaration for ‘Functor MyList’
 • Relevant bindings include
 xs :: MyList a (bound at Main.hs:66:18)
 x :: a (bound at Main.hs:66:16)
 f :: a -> b (bound at Main.hs:66:8)
 fmap :: (a -> b) -> MyList a -> MyList b (bound at Main.hs:66:3)
 How do I write this properly?
 Edit: I've edited the functor code block after seeing u/TheSteelOverlord's comment.

 RET creates a new one (like it usually is the case on other programs like Obsidian or Logseq)

 This command is a gift from the gods, all you could ever want. Set as an alias to 'emacs-tty'!
 The only downfall is the fonts... Not really sure what fonts can be used, and emojis aren't working. If anyone knows how to solve this that would be great.

 | some | cells| ```
 would produce something like  <table id="my-table">....  but instead I get  <table id="orgd84d220">...  where the actual id is set dynamically and changes on every export. 
 I'm pretty sure I'm missing something, but I'm not sure what.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using lsp for a while on my laptop to edit c files (clangd). It works brilliantly.
 ​
 I just started using it on another computer, and although it works fine for the first buffer I open in a project, every subsequent buffer that I open highlights an error that one of the included libraries is "not found." I use CMake, so I've pointed to the build/compile_commands.json, which seems to be picked up when I open the first buffer, but for some reason, every other buffer after the first does not see it _unless_ I restart the workspace.
 ​
 Summary:
 I need to restart my lsp workspace in every buffer after the first in a project for it to pick up the correct compile_commands.json, but it seems to work on another computer.
 I'm not sure what I can do to debug this, since the logs printed to clangd::stderr and lsp-log don't show anything abnormal. Anyone have any pointers on where I can look next?

 I hate to say it, but dropbox was the most robust solution. I wanted to stop paying a monthly fee and own my data, but the friction it has introduced is unexpected.

 With that said, assume I've been living in a cave since 2014. What are some of the major changes in GHC and the set of commonly used packages since then? Is there a list that someone is keeping up somewhere? That would be ideal. My google-fu is failing me.
 An example would be the use of the introduction of the ghc-bignum package. I recall reading about some kind of "regression" regarding the readability of some common compiler errors, but I can't seem to find it now.

 This is the original function: g x y = [ y z | z <- [1..x]]
 My first thought was:
 g' = flip take $ iterate (+1) 1 --This would create a partially applied function which takes in an Int to create a list of that length.
 However I'm not sure how to apply a function to this list. Since the value produced by g' is not an actual list, I can't make it the input of fmap or map. I'm not sure how to continue from here. 
 In a perfect world I'd write
 g = flip fmap $ flip take $ iterate (+1) 1
 and then call
 g (+1) 3 which would produce [2,3,4], but it doesn't. Any help would be appreciated.

 This could be a odd late night thought, but is there a way to make Buffer A only displayed in one Window at a time? In my above example, Window 2 currently would display Buffer A and so would Window 1. I want Window 1 to display something else, perhaps another buffer I have opened or even some default value when Buffer A is opened in Window 2. 
 Thanks in Advance.

After more than a decade of slow but steady growth, Nix gained a lot of traction in the past few years, causing its community to expand at an astonishing rate.
But this growth hasn’t been without issue.
As consultants, we see that nearly all of our clients that are using Nix are, at best, annoyed by the accidental complexity that comes with it.
Some of them even decide to back off because of that, leaving with a nondescript feeling that Nix is not something to be used for solving real-world problems.
It appears the Nix ecosystem has now reached a point where it can either become a credible player in the industry or get stuck with being labeled “research-quality”, a proof of concept, not suitable for serious use.

 But, sometimes, Wanderlust will just freeze without provocation and I'll end up having to dump my Emacs and open it, again.
 This can consistently happen, without fail, if the internet connection drops (which, unfortunately, mine does often).
 Does anyone know of any workaround for this? I don't know if it's a fair comparison or not but I actually don't remember Gnus locking up my Emacs, at all (or, at least, in any way that didn't pass relatively soon), let alone causing a crash.

("What is incremental writing" )


This video demonstrates the critical idea of deconstructing or digesting reading and using the components or nutrients as building blocks for writing/idea creation and synthesis. It goes over the process with a lapidarist skill. Reading and writing are not something that abides by a deadline but is enjoyable without time pressures. It is rewarding to write on three-year-old ideas and see them pop up in a review queue. Reminiscence is falling in love all over again. New note:
What is meant by reminiscing 202207302048
I want to consider the prioritization aspects of zettelkasting in this video. I see his point about how with everything prioritized and working from a prioritized list, you can be sure what time you spend zettelkasting is in the areas you have made your highest priorities.
I've not felt the need to set zettelkasting priorities formally, have you?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Non-coder vim-enthusiast. New to zettelkasten. Actually struggling less with zettelkasten, at least at the moment, than vim. Specifically with getting syncing going between vim installations on iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.
Vim on the mobile devices is actually iVim, an amazing porting of vim to the iOS environment. It has a command (:iexdir) that, in spite of Apple’s sandboxing, makes it possible to establish connections with external directories. I’ve used it to set up a connection to iCloud Drive. My intention was to enable syncing between my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook..
I’ve adopted wiki.vim as my writing plugin of choice. I requires that I place a path to to the root directory in my .vimrc. With a lot of trial-and-error and pleas for help I’ve tried without success to identify a workable path to the directory I’ve placed in iCloud Drive.
At one point I thought I’d discovered a workable path in a file in iVim’s system directories. It is “ /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/BBD512C7-CCA0-47FD-B2F2-0AF17D9D03B5/Documents/wiki”. Alas, iVim does not recognize the path.
I desperation, wanting to move on from fiddling with technology to must writing, I’ve signed up for Bear Notes, mainly for the syncing between devices it provides. I feel like a traitor. I would much prefer to continue experimenting with zettelkasten with vim as my companion.
I write in the unlikely chance, and the desperate hope, that someone here might be able to point me to a solution.
Thanks in any case.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[curious on the specific workflows to fork a project on github all the way to contributing a pull request. The manual describes a lot of options, some steps can take place on github vs others on emacs - how do you guys normally go about it?
  
forking the repo - this you do on github then save the links to the original project and your fork? 
 clone your fork (or original?) regular magit can do the clone, or commandline, or forge?
 add the original project remote calling it upstream if you cloned your own copy (or perhaps adding your fork as another remote if you cloned the original?)
 hereafter everything can be done in forge or do any of you still switch to browser for some things?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says. I recently installed emacs 28.1 with native comp on Arch in wslg, and noticed that everything, even small files, were slowing to a crawl when scrolling. A profile showed that linum-mode was to blame. I disabled it and voilá, yeah, everything was smooth. That got me puzzled, since I expected that having linum-mode native would make it faster, not slower (though I understand things are not that simple, specially in a VM).
 Now I had to switch to display-line-numbers-mode, which works perfectly, but, as many others, I really don't like the positioning.
 Any ideas? Either of speeding up linum-mode or changing position of display-line-numbers-mode,

 It is basically just to add your vault files to .gitattributes with something like /**/vault.yml diff=ansible-vault merge=binary and changing git settings with git config --global diff.ansible-vault.textconv "ansible-vault view. This works perfectly in the terminal, but has the side effect that vault changes no longer appear in Magit diffs.
 Does anybody know how to make this work in our lovely Magit?

 I found some stuff about a change in a macro or function with the switch to emacs 28 but I do not understand why I start to get this now weeks after switching to fedora 36. 
 It also is not clear how I can solve this, how to get the latest org-mode (wasn't that included in emacs ?) and why it only starts creating problems now 
 Can I delete the 20171205 version?

HJKL to move around is great, I love it, they are aligned and side by side. When I switch to BÉPO (the DVORAK keyboard layout of the French) I lose all my shortcuts. I can then write a lot of rammapage settings but they won't work from one program to another. And it's very frustrating, ugly, not functional with some plugins. I use VIM shortcuts on vscode, and other software. I want to stay flexible in case I change IDE in a company for example.
 Anyway, I don't dare to change my keyboard layout just because of vim.
 I wanted to know if Emacs was also a problem when changing the keyboard layout. 
 PS: I recently bought a mechanical keyboard with layer keys (the Dygma Defy), so I'm wondering about leaving vim even though I like it a lot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm collecting information on basic Org mode assist in tools that are not Emacs. I already have: GitHub, GitLab (exactly like GitHub), OrgModeWeb, Orgzly, Orgro, Emacs, vim-orgmode. What I need is information on much more tools. I have set up a syntax checking file on GitHub which also contains my current compatibility table for the most basic set that makes sense as a Markdown-pendant outside of Emacs according to my subjective judgement on Org mode at the bottom. My focus is on tools that - at least - offer text formatting syntax highlighting for *bold* /italic/ and so forth. The rest could be "works as text but has no special support for outlining and more". The goals is to emphasize that there are much more tools ‏‏‎ that allow for viewing and/or editing data in Org mode syntax. Since I don't have an iPhone, iOS-based tools supporting Org mode syntax is very much appreciated. Please do hand in more lines for the table either here, via email or as a GitHub pull request. Thank you!

I've looked into org drill but I don't want to use it as I'd like to stick with anki for spaced repitition. But oftentimes, I'll be in emacs and would like to search my anki collection. I also know about anki-editor to export org mode "cards" to anki, which in the future can work to search the cards I created in org, but what I'd really like to be able to search my current anki collection from emacs to see if a fact exists in one of my anki decks.

 Is this possible? I've seen anki2org package that can convert anki cards to org mode, and maybe this could work but I'd like to have org mode be able to just read my .apkg files without having to constantly convert it manually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello text wizards,
 I recently switched to Vertico, Consult, Orderless, Embark, Marginalia as a completion framework.
 One hurdle I came across is Projectile. I use projectile often (I prefer the extra functionality it has over project.el). But how do I integrate Projectile with all this. For Ivy there is counsel-projectile which overrides most projectile functionality and work awesome. For consult there is consult-projectile but it seems a bit lacking compared to counsel-projectile.
 ​
 Is there a better alternative? or am I missing something with this completion framework and I should combine more consult and embark functionality with projectile somehow?
 Do you use projectile with a similar completion stack? If so do you have any advice of config files to share?
 ​
 [EDIT] My bad after taking a deeper look to respond to u/bespokey I realized that they are pretty similar not sure why I thought they were more. My bad.
 Thanks in advance!

 All I know is that for the small amounts of data involved it is not as fast as I expect, and in any case I expect my data to grow beyond its capabilities.
 Since plists and JSON look pretty much alike do guys think that managing the data with JSON may be a good idea? I was going to talk about redis but learned that redis doesn't use JSON as its native data format, but can use the JSON data format as well.
 Are there some external modules that Emacs can them with for better performance?
 How much data can savehist handle efficiently? I have a feeling I may be abusing it for something it is not intended for.

 The highlighted text "GNU" appears to be small in comparison with the surrounding zoomed text. I am using mac by the way. Are you able to reproduce this? How to resolve this so that the isearch highlighted text also grows in size as the buffer is zoomed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I would like to ditch Ivy/Counsel for Vertico. There is a package called "helpful" that I had configured like so:
 (use-package helpful :after counsel :bind ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key) ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command) ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable) ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function) :custom (counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable) (counsel-describe-variable-function #'helpful-variable)) 
 The package was used to improve the default help system by providing more contextual information.
 I think I need to remove the counsel related lines. Right? However, I'm not sure how to map the keys in that case.
 The github page for helpful package says:
 ;; Note that the built-in `describe-function' includes both functions ;; and macros. `helpful-function' is functions only, so we provide ;; `helpful-callable' as a drop-in replacement. (global-set-key (kbd "C-h f") #'helpful-callable) (global-set-key (kbd "C-h v") #'helpful-variable) (global-set-key (kbd "C-h k") #'helpful-key) 
 So that means that I don't need to use remap describe-variable and remap describe-function?

 I didn't mind having extra long columns in the editor, but wanted some escape sequences that cause the output to break into multiple lines in the table cells.
 Imagine my surprise when asked a few days ago and got an answer and got a response from u/redblobgames. Big up to him (I hope I haven't misgendered him 😮).
 There is the solution, right there in the manual
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Quoting-HTML-tags.html
 and you guys kept it from me for ages.
 I even thought it was a new feature recently introduced into org but it seems to have been around forever - and you guys kept it from me.
 You have been bad naughty boys. No cookies for you.

Besides, installing EAF feels like exiting emacs entirely. I have seen some things done with xwidget-webkit that seem cool, and this is already integrated into emacs (although I would have to compile it myself). I am wondering what is the bleeding-edge browser experience available in emacs right now (that one could install from one of the repos like MELPA or by compiling emacs with certain options). Alternatively, I have also heard of Nyxt. Could Nyxt be used instead of emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm new to emacs and have been working my way through various Info manuals I find interesting. Right now I'm on the "eintr" one (the intro to Lisp one). In section 4.1 "Finding More Information", it says the following:
 For example, ‘xref-find-definitions’ will jump to the various nodes in the Texinfo source file of this document (provided that you’ve run the ‘etags’ utility to record all the nodes in the manuals that come with Emacs; see (emacs)Create Tags Table). 
 When I try the command M-. it puts this in the minibuffer:
 Visit tags table (default TAGS): /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/28.1/share/info/emacs/ 
 Which I interpret to mean I do not have a TAGS file already generated for the Info pages.
 If I navigate to:
 /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/28.1/share/info/emacs 
 And then do:
 etags eintr.info.gz 
 It does create a TAGS file, but it doesn't look right. Every line starts with "function", which makes me think etags interpreted this as the wrong language. I'm assuming the language expected is texinfo (based on the Info pages own text), so I tried manually specifying the language:
 etags -l texinfo eintr.info.gz 
 But it creates an almost-empty TAGS file.
 Now I'm kind of stumped. Anyone have any ideas how I can get tags working within Info mode? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, lsp-eslint was working for me. But this morning it isn't. Trying to figure it out. I'm on macos.
 lsp-eslint-server-command is a variable defined in lsp-eslint.el. Value ("node" "~/server/out/eslintServer.js" "--stdio") 
 (I don't have a ~/server/out/eslintServer.js directory. That's seems to be the default though.)
 When I run lsp-install-server, I get this in Messages buffer:
 LSP :: Download eslint started. LSP :: Starting to download https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-server-binaries/blob/master/dbaeumer.vscode-eslint-2.2.2.vsix?raw=true to /var/folders/dk/b2328vnn2gj6mhmy6sx2y3sc0000gn/T/extWd6p44.zip...

(Shell command succeeded with no output) LSP :: Server eslint downloaded, auto-starting in 0 buffers. 
 It looks like the download succeeds, but it's not extracting it anywhere that I can find. What can I look in to?
 The error message:

 While this is PureScript related, I'm posting here since I suspect a large part of the community lurks around here as well.
 While doing PureScript, I found translating HTML snippets (e.g. Tailwind components) tedious and needed a tool to help with that. Since I couldn't find any, I made one.
 You can try it out here https://purescriptify.web.app/
 Code is at https://github.com/dnikolovv/purescriptify
 It's pretty basic, but I'm surprised at how good it gets the job done. It can be extended to support other flavors as well, e.g. Halogen.

 Including reporting precise location range (i.e. a pair of filename+linenumber) for each error.
 Thanks in advance.

 emacs-groundup snapshot
 Hi,
 A while ago, I had introduced emacs-groundup - an emacs spin aimed at elisp novices. Happy to announce its first versioned release! To re-iterate its objectives:
  
Provides a solid, ootb workflow for task and project management.
 Pre-configured for Julia and python programming - supports both REPL and notebook based workflows.
 Ideal for users looking to 'try emacs'. It can be used as-is by setting only a handful of (including zero) parameters.
 May interest 'experienced' elisp novices and/or emacs novices 'looking to get serious'. The code is amply commented, and package configurations are as decoupled as possile. Perfect to learn how to write elisp and how to configure some of the more commonly-used packages.
  
Give it a go! All user feedback and contributions are welcome.

 elisp (defun hide-region-hide () "Hides a region by making an invisible overlay over it and save the overlay on the hide-region-overlays \"ring\"" (interactive) (let ((new-overlay (make-overlay (mark) (point)))) (push new-overlay hide-region-overlays) (overlay-put new-overlay 'invisible t) (overlay-put new-overlay 'intangible t) (overlay-put new-overlay 'before-string (if hide-region-propertize-markers (propertize hide-region-before-string 'font-lock-face 'hide-region-before-string-face) hide-region-before-string)) (overlay-put new-overlay 'after-string (if hide-region-propertize-markers (propertize hide-region-after-string 'font-lock-face 'hide-region-after-string-face) hide-region-after-string))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm about to learn PureScript, coming from a functional TypeScript, Clojure and Elm background. To get a first taste for the language I thought I'd rewrite my Clojure test-app which generates static HTML files from JSON input using the hiccup templating library.
 Is there some similar library in PureScript which would provide functions to create an HTML document and its content? Something similar to Haskell's blaze? I could not find anything when searching pursuit, but I might be just be using the wrong search terms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now I have this template:
  (setq org-capture-templates '(("n" "Note") ("ns" "Special note" entry (file+datetree "~/Documents/notes.org") "**** %<%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M:%S>\n%?" :tree-type week) )) 
 ​
 What I would like to do is to show the capture window when pressing ns as is now, but then when I save it with C-c C-c also add, automatically, the date of the actual save (time when C-c C-c was pressed. And possibly the difference in minutes (I don't need seconds) between the time of pressing ns and C-c C-c.
 So, in the end it would look like this: 
  (setq org-capture-templates '(("n" "Note") ("ns" "Special note" entry (file+datetree "~/Documents/notes.org") "**** %<%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M:%S> - %H2:%M2:%S2 (duration: 12 minutes) \n%?" :tree-type week) )) 
 How to do something like that? Is it even possible in org-capture?
