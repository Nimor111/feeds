Nothing in my .emacs explains why it is launching in split screen. I also tried killing Messages on launch but it didn't work because it just brings in the scratch and Messages buffres on start. Below are the relevant pieces on my .emacs file.
 Diary info:
 ``` (setq initial-buffer-choice 'diary-fancy-display-mode)
 ;desktop notifications (require 'notifications)
 (defcustom appt-notification-bus :session "dbus notifications" :version "29.05" :group 'appt-notification :type '(choice (const :tag "Session bus" :session) string))

 (setq appt-disp-window-function (function user/appt-display))
 (setq-default diary-file "/home/alarm/.emacs.d/diary" appt-display-format 'window appt-display-duration 60 appt-audible t appt-display-interval 15 appt-message-warning-time 15 display-time-24hr-format t display-time-day-and-date t)

 What's your favorite noob starter kit, especially if it simplifies the navigation commands?

 I went ahead and manually downloaded all the packages from melpa and placed them under ~/.emacs.d/elpa. Now, when emacs starts it complains: 
 Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading `C:/User/myusername/.emacs.d/init.el': error: Package `use-package-' is unavailable 
 The init.el contains:

 Any idea how to make it work in my environment? FWIW, I'm running 29.0.50. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am trying to wrap my head around the Profunctor typeclasses.
 Notably, I am trying to find out why there isn't a lot of code around using something like Monoidal/ProductProfuctor and instead there seems to have been a decision to go for Traversing and similar typeclasses.
 I have been looking mostly at this discussion from a couple of years ago that has the following:
  
davemenendez says that you can implement wander using the Monoidal typeclass (which, as far as I can tell, is only true if your profunctor is representable?)
 ekmett says that Monoidal is implemented via Traversing in the profunctors lib (which doesn't make sense to me, because I don't see how one can write one in terms of the other)
  
There's the glassery blog post from Oleg that also mentions Monoidal, but with disappointment because it doesn't bring much on top of Choice, if I understand correctly (but I don't see e.g. Costar mentioned in the table where this conclusion is reached).
 I have spent a couple of hours trying to implement Monoidal in terms of Traversing and vice-versa and gone nowhere unless I also bring Representable to the table, but there are some good examples for non-representable instances of Monoidal so I don't want to do this.
 Either I am missing some cool trick in my bag of tricks or I really don't understand what's happening here.
 Anyone got some illuminating text or notes or something?

 However, these only stop the backup files that start with a ~, the kind that I'm seeing now, I haven't been able to find references for it on the web. Any pointers are highly appreciated.

 I have recently learned Haskell and have written some code but I feel like I am just writing pure functions in a procedural and I am not taking advantage of the abstractions offered by Haskell. It is not that I don't know about these abstractions it is because I don't think about them when I am writing code so my question is do you have any suggestions on how to actually write code that takes complete advantage of Haskell's awesomeness? Feel free to point me to any book/articles/videos that talk about this subject. Thanks!
 PS: In order to learn Haskell I have read Learn you a Haskell for great good and Haskell from first principles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a new package but I need help because I don't really know how to "link" a function to an object. Here is the current structure of my code:
 (defmacro print-first (first) "Print FIRST name." `(message ,first)) (defmacro print-full (first last) "Print FIRST and LAST name." `(message ,(concat first " " last))) (defun make-pet (first-name last-name) "Create a pet using FIRST-NAME and LAST-NAME." (make-record 'pet 1 `(first-name last-name (print-first first-name) (print-full first-name last-name)))) 
 Basically I want a user to be able to define a pet, and my library should be able to generate functions for that pet. In my actual library, some of these functions modify the properties of the pet itself not shown here. Is what I have shown here the best way to do this? Should I be using make-record?
 Also, are there any tips for testing macros? I am reading about how when they are compiled and ran that they behave differently than when evaluated and ran.

The Precursor is the latest open source hardware project from OSHW wizard Andrew "bunnie" Huang – AKA "the guy who broke the Xbox DRM and is now suing to overturn the DMCA."
 https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5921
 It's a mobile hardware platform, "a framework upon which you can assemble a wide variety of DIY mobile applications…designed from the ground-up to be carried around in your pocket."
 "It’s not just a naked circuit board with connectors hanging off at random locations: it comes fully integrated—with a rechargeable battery, a display, and a keyboard—in a sleek, 7.2 mm (quarter-inch) aluminum case."
 The design is derived from the Betrusted project, an ambitious open source hardware privacyphone initiative that is super cool, but still has a long way to go before it's ready for field use.
  
 After digging through the docs, it looks like it uses a Rust-based OS called Xous 
 https://xobs.io/announcing-xous-the-betrusted-operating-system/
 Given that this is a BW graphics device with a hardware keyboard, long battery life, wifi, and fits into your pocket -- this might be the ideal mobile emacs device.
  
I'm not sure if Emacs will compile on it, and there's no X11 or Wayland to speak of, so there will be some roadbumps.

 I tried M-x package reinstall pdf-tools, but for some reason I can't find the pdf-tools package.
 I really don't know what happened.
 I use Arch, and i3wm. My version of emacs is 27.2

 I mainly use emacs for org mode and some light coding. I do use vim bindings. I'm on a mac
 With Doom I feel like there is a lot of extra stuff that I don't need or understand. I like the idea of building something from scratch that is leaner and fits my needs. Also, if I have a question, it's hard to know if it's a doom thing or an emacs thing. I would just learn emacs
 Does that make sense high level? Would it be a crazy amount of work to configure it to what I use emacs for now? I'm willing to do some work to get to a good place, but don't want to be stuck fiddling with it forever either. Is there somewhere that would be good to start from?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I have been working on a simple threading / pipeline library for emacs largely based off a cl library with the same name. For those who don't know what that means its basically a way to make deeply nested code into something much easier to read. It can be thought of as analogous to a unix pipe.
 (some (code (that (is (deeply (nested)))))) ;; turns into (arr-> (nested) (deeply) (is) (that) (code) (some)) 
 where the result of the last result is passed in as the first argument of the next.
 There are other variants for different use cases, whether you need to pass it in as the last argument or even if you need arbitrary placements, all can currently be achieved. This is not the end though as there are plans to aggregate a bunch of arrows from different languages, not because its necessarily practical but because its fun!
 here is the github page for it, if people want to use it, if its useful to people ill also post it to (m)elpa
 Feedback and PR's are as always appreciated.

2022 Week 12
Last Week
Onboarding and refactoring "Paul, Annie Murphy. The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2021." My experience working in my ZK with the notes from reading Annie Paul's book was basso-profundo. The ideas resonated, and it was easy to rewrite the highlights with my understanding and find relevant links to what was already in my ZK.
Reading "Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson."
This Week
More reading and onboarding "Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson."
I'm most excited about the development of a proximity search tool! While refactoring and deep linking "The Extended Mind," the near_search.py proved itself. It quickly surfaced surprisingly relevant link candidates that would have taken lots of time and frustration to find.
I want to start on a short video presentation on using citations with The Archive integrating Zotero and Pandoc for perfect Markdown to PDF or Word documents. You can easily cite using any style (CMOS, MLA, APA, IEEE, or whatever) and have the final document outputted in any format you need.

Note identifiers are avoided altogether in favor of descriptive filenames. This obviates the timestamp versus Folgezettel question. A tradeoff is that note filenames should be unique and should be considered immutable: a title cannot be changed without changing each reference to the note with that title. This seems like a minor inconvenience, in view of the use of backlinks to create indexes and hubs, below.


Bibliographic entries (literature notes) are separate notes that link to a note titled Bibliography.  The choice of writing bibliographic entries within Obsidian (the slip box component of the Zettelkasten) seems less efficient than working with a reference manager such…]]></summary>

 How can I configure TCP keep alive parameters per-socket, specifically TCP_KEEPCNT, TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL? This is based on this doc for context.
 network library exposes SO_KEEPALIVE parameter that as I understand enables/disables it, but not the three parameters above? Even with that parameter, when I print its value after setting it to 1 in the client I get 64 and in the server I get 8 – so I am not sure if I am setting it correctly...
 There is also keep-alive library that seems to allow configuring TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL per socket, but it doesn't compile on Mac.
 I would really appreciate any suggestions here - thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently writing an article in org-mode and use org-cite for my citation needs. I export via LaTeX and have everything working as expected, using biblatex-apa in the background.
 Following APA guidelines, I need to produce a few citations with a prefix that ends in a semicolon, e.g., "... (here is the prefix; Author, 2022)." Unfortunately I can't get this to work since the semicolon is used as a delimiter of citations in org-cite (cf. here). Thus I can produce "... (here is the prefix, Author, 2022)" with [cite:here is the prefix, @author2022], but [cite:here is the prefix; @author2022] doesn't work.
 As a workaround, I could use LaTeX code (e.g., \autocite[here is the prefix;][]{author2022}) which yields the correct result when used in LaTeX directly. The problem is that the prefixes are mostly acronyms, which I like to put in small capitals, and exporting \autocite[\textsc{abc};][]{author2022} to LaTeX for somehow doesn't work (it gets converted to \autocite[\textsc{abc};][]\{author2022\}).
 How can I produce the citation with a prefix that ends in a semicolon? This should be simple, but I can't find a solution and it is driving me mad. Any help is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm a mentor for FIRST Robotics Competition. I want to transition my team of novice high-school students from Java.
 EDIT: I shouldn't have assumed that people would just be familiar with FIRST... I've had a few questions asking exactly what I my use case is. Essentially, students are given 8 weeks to build a robot for a competition. We aren't told the rules in advance, so everyone has the same 8 week period to design, build, and program the robot.
 However, off-season teams tend to do things like write general purpose code (e.g., movement) or streamline processes, make practice robots, etc.
 The library used in the competition (optional; teams can also create low level code from scratch, but almost nobody does) is called WPILIB. It's primarily a Java and C++ framework, which you can read about here.
 I recently became an F# evangelist and found that functional programming has greatly reduced the fragility of my code by way of ensuring a correct data model.
 I am looking to move our team to possibly using Spring and definitely using Scala or Kotlin.
 One of my fellow mentors has suggested that object oriented design is easier to reason with in the case of a robot, and suggested Kotlin as our next language.
 I suggested that functional programming can definitely be used to model a Robotics systems and ensure that invalid states are explicitly rejected while making the program easier to debug and test.
 Regardless of which language we pick, everyone will be learning it (and Spring) from scratch. 
 What are your thoughts? Which language will better suit what we're trying to do?
 EDIT 2: We have decided on Kotlin for the main application code for now, but if Scala makes more sense for certain use cases (e.g., programming autonomous mode functions) we will be open to writing those modules in Scala. I still welcome any discussions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that this might come across as rude, and I apologise in advance if it does, but is anyone able to give me some rationale for why the Yesod forms API is the way it is? It seems to me to be incredibly overcomplicated. There's a mess of boilerplate, what with creating a data type and generating a widget from it, even if you need all of two fields, as in the case of a login form. In particular, controlling the layout and appearance of the form seems to be extremely cumbersome. The applicative API seems basically useless, given that you don't have any control over appearance - as soon as you want to do something as simple as tweak the label font size you have to drop to the monadic API.
 I'm coming from Flask here, so my reference point that you just write your form in a jinja2 template, in which you have full and straightforward control over the form's layout and appearance, then you access the form data from a request like so:
 ``` @app.route("/login", methods=("GET", "POST")) def login(): """Log in a registered user by adding the user id to the session.""" if request.method == "POST": username = request.form["username"] password = request.form["password"]
  # do things with username and password 
 ```
 Why not have something similar in Yesod, simply write the form as a Hamlet widget, and access the form data by name, instead of all this stuff with creating a datatype and generating the widget from it using generateFormPost and runFormPost? I'm new to Yesod, so I understand I'm probably missing a lot of information. But I don't think I require much expertise to state that I'm finding the API pretty unpleasant to use.

 The issue is this: when I run git commit it launches a new frame in my terminal, as you'd expect. The issue arises if I choose to cancel my commit using C-c C-k. Canceling the commit returns me to my terminal hanging on the git message "Hint: waiting for your editor to close the file...". It hangs until I take some other action on my system (taking an action such as spawning a new terminal, opening a new emacsclient, etc).
 If you have any ideas on what may be causing this, or I how I can provide more information, please let me know.

 Where the [1-9] is one color, the (.*) is another color, and the \1 is the same color. Or something similar.
 Web searches seem to inevitably assume we're talking about finding matches for the regex.
 Is this a thing, or am I crazy for even wanting it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm making an ODE solver using Runge-Kutta. Implementing with lists is pretty easy but I was wondering if lists are the best container to be using.
 ODE's solved in this way start with an initial condition and are solved by advancing by a time-step (if time is the relevant parameter) based on the current state. This is nicely solved using the iterate function. 
 I was initially planning on switching to a vector type or similar, but maybe that is not necessary?
 Any thoughts on if it's worth trying different container types?

Initially, running mbsync -aV would just download all emails from the remote. While this wasn't a problem for my work email (a relatively new mailbox), I suspect this would be of a greater issue for my personal gmail as I have thousands of useless/spam/marketing emails which just eats up space. Given the download rate limit from gmail (2.5GB per day) and my limited local drive space, I was wondering if there is any setup in mbsync to only download N number of recent emails, or download emails after a specific year. (I could, alternatively, just cleanup my gmail inbox. Maybe that will be the last option!)

 However, I can't seem to find anything that goes beyond the introductory level when it comes to concurrency stuff.
 I want to understand how threads work, what exactly a ExecutionContext does, what the heck is a Semaphore and a IORef?
 Is there anything that teaches me, from the very beginning, threads? Perhaps not why they exist (I know that), but what are their consequences, and how do we go about alleviating those consequences?
 The only extensive resource I could find is the book "Java Threads", which seems to be outdated, but I could be wrong.
 How did you learn all that stuff? Thanks.

 I thought the same. However, it's such a complex graph of dependencies involving type families and similar that I gave up after 20 minutes of trying to add deriving instances for some types and finding workarounds for others where that's not possible.
 There's also the excellent recover-rtti library and its anythingToString function, but I couldn't use it here since it wasn't compatible with the version of GHC I was using.

 https://corwin.bru.st/emacs-28
 In addition to what gets posted to the alpha FTP site, the scripts make and upload "NATIVE_FULL_AOT" versions (from the emacs-28 and master branches, currently).
 If you aren't familiar, passing NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1 to make triggers full ahead-of-time native elisp compilation. In the case of Windows builds, this means the build will include DLLs for most/all elisp sources distributed with Emacs. These DLLs can be used without additional pre-requisites apart from what is included in emacs-<version>.zip (or emacs-<version>-installer.exe). This is useful when you can't --don't want-- to put GCC/libgccjit on a Windows system where you use Emacs.
 Thanks much for all of the help testing out the builds I've been making and in advance for your feedback on the AOT versions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Haskell all the Comonads (at least the ones defined in the comonads package) are duals of transformers Monad Transformers. This is taken by changing the occurrence of the “state parameter” from positive to negative occurrence ((,) s <-> (->) s). 
 For example (in pseudocode)
 —- m is Monad, w is Comonad —- Writer and Co-writer WriterT s m a ~ m ((,) s a) TracedT s w a ~ w ((->) s a) —- Reader and Co-reader ReaderT s m a ~ (->) s (m a) EnvT s w a ~ (,) s (w a) —- State and Co-State StateT s m a ~ (->) s (m ((,) s a)) StoreT s w a ~ (,) s (w ((->) s a)) 
 However this is also a pretty restricted notion of duality. I wanted to know if there is a more intuition as to why this is the case, and then to what the dual of something like MaybeT, SelectT, and ContT (or is there?). Or why (->) and (,) are duals (because one is the exponential, and the other is the product); why aren’t the duals Either and (,)?
 MaybeT m a ~ m (Maybe a) ~ m (1 + a) CoMaybeT w a ~ w (Void, a) ~ w (0 * a) —- Note that CoMaybeT is uninhabited when w is a Comonad

 I search "re-run with -deprecation for details scala" on internet. nothing comes up.

 I have no clue how to figure out where the error come from. 
 I can't seem to find anything related to scala by searching google. 
 For example, converting number base like from base 2 to base 10.

 I am reading a book on scala right now, so if I have encounter the material in the book before, I may be lucky and find answer there.
 ​
 I also search scala api document.

 How can I search for error related to scala language? 
 I can't seem to find anything by searching google, search from books, search scala api.

 It it unclear to me where I should include my message to the forwarded email. I tried adding it before and after this text, but my text does not actually show up on all email clients of my recipients (for example Gmail).
 This style of forwarding is different from what I am used. I came from mu4e and other email clients where an email is usually quoted (as it would have been for a reply) and then I usually top-post my additional message.
 How do I correctly forward a message in notmuch? Is there a way to have a more "traditional" forwarding format which uses the same format as when replying (with a different message subject)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While navigation in Python code I can use which-function-mode to show the current function/method in the modeline or (after some more configurations) in the headline also.
 It seems that this is a mode is "global" and there is no way to restrict this mode to python buffers only. I don't understand the details but somebody explained it here on emacs.stackexchange.
 So the question is if there is another package or solution to have something like this (prefered in the headline) but in Python buffers only.
 I read about some lsp-mode depended solutions. The problem here is that I use eglot instead of lsp-mode and won't change that.

Now, whenever I try to correct the spelling of a word with ispell-word, instead of having the possible choices appear through Vertico, they appear in a pop up window at the top of the screen, and I can press a number to select the desired word. 
 I think it should be possible to integrate the spelling completions into Vertico - I know that Doom Emacs does this. Does anyone know how to set this up correctly? I was recommended the "spell-correct" package, but I can't find it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In short - Decades with Emacs but have only used org for recording notes, snippets, ideas.. never for tasks. Okay writing elisp just always used a simple checklists in whatever pocketable devices I had at the time. Random youtubes or org-mode pages tends to show simple agenda view but what I _think_ I'm looking for is more complex and I'm not sure org-agenda/etc can do it as is? (Presumably there are org query APIs I could hijack and make my own major mode viewer, but trying to reduce TODOs not add more ;)
 With hundreds of to-dos, perhaps org-mode/agenda/whatever can save me? The rate of adding to-dos exceeds the rate of completing them sadly :)
 Ideally plainorg or beorg can render it as well.
 Current Workflow:
 - many are dated to-do's - the date by which I'd like to see them
 - many are undated, but tagged (home, work, cycling, etc etc) and/or prioritized (high, medium, someday, etc)
 What I'd like to see is a single view including (in order):
 (by default, ignore tags; but be nice if the below could also be filtered down to 1 or more tags as well)
 - dated yet unfinished tasks for today
 - tasks that are pass due (dated for yesterday or earlier, and not checked off)
 - tasks that are undated, sorted by priority (descending)
 I don't want to have to cycle views for this, which is the trick; every to-do system in the planet can let you show upcoming or late to-dos, or the ones by tag, or the undated ones. I want the combined single view, so can glance and go.
 Most to-do applications (such as Apple Reminders) let you create smart lists that you pick very specific criteria, without OR functionality; so date for tomorrow, but not date for tomorrow+undated; a specific priority, but no sort by priority after picking two priorities say, that sort of thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've started a new job writing lisp, and using emacs as the default environment. I'm still learning the editor (and the language), but the part I'm having the most trouble adapting to is C-z C-x C-c C-v commands that are standard with Windows. Given that I've used those commands since I've used computers in general, I don't think it's going to be easy to switch over.
 I've seen that there is a mode that sort of removes that possibility, CUA mode, but it seems like it would interfere with most of the slime commands. C-c and C-x seem to be very busy keys.
 And so I have thought of a solution that I think would work, and it's crackpot enough that I think trying it will be fun. I'm not completely sure it will work, and so am requesting community input.
 OK, so here's the plan. I'm going to de-mothball my custom keyboard which allows me to remap keys. Then I would remap the Caps-Lock key to one of the F13-F24 keys, and then using that as the Control for emacs sequences. C-c would be (Caps lock)-c and C-x would be (Caps lock)-x. I think that's possible to change in my init file? Emacs has proven to be a remarkable beast in its extensibility and I'm like 90% sure that this is doable.
 Anyway, I am wondering if there is some obvious problem with this plan, other than the glaringly obvious one which is that it's less trouble to just learn the shortcuts. (What's the fun in that, though?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been throwing together bits of elisp over the past few months and it's sort of turned into a tiny little major mode for Typescript (and Javascript) webapp files: https://github.com/orzechowskid/tsx-mode.el
 indentation and jit-lock syntax highlighting are powered by tree-sitter, and code analysis and completion are powered by lsp-mode. servers and grammars for both should be automatically installed and configured for you. tagged template strings for some common CSS-in-JS patterns are indented and support code-folding, and have CSS syntax highlighting and completion applied to them when point is inside of them.
 I've been using this at work and at home for a while now and am very pleased with it. but I'm positive there are hidden assumptions it makes and/or failures in handling use-cases which I personally don't have, so I'd love to get extra eyes on it to see where it can improve. comments (or PRs!) are very welcome.
 thanks for looking!

For me, it’s all very abstract, but I feel like I’m making slow progress. Sometimes the intuition doesn’t work for me, then I try to let me guide by the types. When implementing toListOf I get stuck because “type tetris” doesn’t help anymore:
 They start with
 toListOf :: Traversal s s a a -> (s -> [a]) 
 where a Traversal s t a b s is a function
 forall f. Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> (s -> f t) 
 Then, they generalize Traversal s s a a to
 (a -> Const (Endo [a]) a) -> (s -> Const (Endo [a]) s)

What are factors to consider, when choosing EXWM vs. any other tiling WM? 
 Would you tell me which tiling WM you use and why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do use use-package but for a lot of packages there is not install and config instructions for it.
 This is my working configuration which I have some questions about.
  
The eglot start (via eglot-ensure) is configured in the (use-package python-mode block via a :hook. Python modes starts eglot. Is this a good solution? 
 company start is configured via a :hook in (use-package company block and starts when eglot comes up.
  
```emacslisp ; .... ; language server (replacement for lsp-mode) (use-package eglot)
 (use-package python-mode :ensure nil ; makes sure that Emacs in-build python-mode is used :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) ; connect to language server when py-file is opened :custom (python-shell-interpreter "python3") )
 (use-package company :after eglot ; this line alone does not help to start company :hook (eglot-managed-mode . company-mode) ; starts company when eglot is started )
 (use-package company-box :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))
 ; ..... ```
 I have some more examples; e.g. the ws-buttler. Do I start it that way?  (use-package ws-butler :init (progn (add-hock 'python-mode-hook 'ws-butler-mode))) 
 Or with a :hook where I do not know what I have to write there.  (use-package ws-butler :hook ?????? 
 Or should I use the python-mode?  (use-package python-mode :ensure nil ; makes sure that Emacs in-build python-mode is used :hook (python-mode . ws-butler-mode) 
 On important point is that e.g. ws-butler-mode should not only start when a Python buffer is opened. It should only work in that Python buffers and not in others after it is started.
 As a newbie it is very hard to decide which configuration ways I should use to start a mode. Should the mode install itself in via a hook to another mode (python)? Should the other mode (python) start it? etc etc

 data Counter a = Counter Integer a | Increment instance Functor Counter where fmap f (Counter count x) = Counter count (f x) fmap f Increment = Increment instance Applicative Counter where pure x = Counter 0 x (<*>) (Counter count1 f) (Counter count2 x) = Counter (count1 + count2) (f x) (<*>) Increment (Counter count x) = Counter (count + 1) x --Unsure if these two follow applicative laws tbh (<*>) (Counter count f) Increment = Increment (<*>) Increment Increment = Increment 
 ```
 My error:
 ```sh
 <interactive>:121:41: error: * Couldn't match type `a' with `b' Expected: Counter b Actual: Counter a `a' is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: (Prelude.<*>) :: forall a b. Counter (a -> b) -> Counter a -> Counter b at <interactive>:120:5-9 `b' is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: (Prelude.<*>) :: forall a b. Counter (a -> b) -> Counter a -> Counter b at <interactive>:120:5-9 * In the expression: Counter (count + 1) x In an equation for `Prelude.<*>': (Prelude.<*>) Increment (Counter count x) = Counter (count + 1) x In the instance declaration for `Applicative Counter' * Relevant bindings include x :: a (bound at <interactive>:121:36) (<*>) :: Counter (a -> b) -> Counter a -> Counter b (bound at <interactive>:120:5) 
 ``` Alright, so for my own personal education I'm trying to figure out how applicatives relate to effects outside of monads.
 My interpretation of an effect is something which changes the data structure, but is not affected by fmap
 The solution I came up with was to put the effect data as part of the "main" constructor, and the effect action as a union'd constructor. Thing is this type error is messing with me, and I'm not sure how to resolve it. First of all, is my interpretation of what an effect is wrong? Secondly, why is Counter a /= Counter b in this error message? They're both generic, so why is it having trouble with a = b?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 Very long-time emacs user but not a programmer (ASIC engineer - mostly working with SystemVerilog, Python, BASH, and TCL) so I can only go so far with emacs-lisp. Running 27.2 and I use ibuffer with ibuffer-formats and ibuffer-saved-filter-groups to organize all my types of files and directories I'm working on. I want a column that contains the directory paths to the buffers' files. I want this so I can display it with ibuffer-formats and filter on it in ibuffer-saved-filter-groups to keep track of files with the same name but for different projects.
 I've defined a couple of simple columns but can't figure out how to do this for path. I looked at the standard ones in ibuffer.el like filename but the code is a bit beyond my pay grade. I'd really appreciate any help or pointers for this. Some day I'll have time to become an emacs-lisp guru, but that time, unfortunately, is not now.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, learning FP and Haskell.
 I'm confused by the claim that FP is about programming the "what" and not the "how" (see 2nd paragraph in wiki). How could you possibly write a computer program without telling the computer what to do (the how)?
 The closest answer I've gathered is that FP is essentially about term rewriting systems (using beta reduction in particular). A rewriting step is analogous to a state transition step in turing machines. So then that means the compiler handles all the control flow for you, rather than FP somehow magically eliminating the need for control flow and other imperative ideas.
 Is this understanding correct? What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I do a lot personally is editing and running python project in remote servers, which almost always come with their own condo environments. I'm currently trying to do this in emacs with python-mode, lsp-mode and conda-mode. The command conda-activate works perfectly with lsp on my local machine, but when using tramp, it seems that the same command can only select environments from my local conda, no the remote one.
 Is there a way around this? Or is this unavoidable?
 Before getting into emacs, I used vim. Keeping a copy of vim in remote server was easy enough and access through ssh works nicely. If it's impossible to use conda environments on remote, is it possible to create some type of emacs client on remote and run something like graphic ssh?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got this recursive function with loads of guards. What i've tried to do is converting a python function of mine into a haskell function. 
 This python function is a simple recursive function with an if statement with multiple nested if statements within it. 
 The problem is when I converted this code to haskell I used guards and it's very much unreadable. Just to give as an example, this is one of my guards:
 | indexTxt < length txt && pat !! indexPat == txt !! indexTxt && (indexPat + 1) == length pat = findPat txt pat (indexTxt + 1) (calcPrefix pat 1 0 [] !! indexPat + 1) (mIndexes ++ [(indexTxt + 1) - (indexPat + 1)]) 
 It doesn't even fit on the screen as you can see.
 Is there any way to make my function more readable? I imagine I need to find some other way to makes this code more readable and preferably smaller, but I have no idea what my options are.
 Any help/tips/guidance would be appreciated.

 Then, I noticed that on the other device there is no elpa folder inside .emacs.d, I thought this makes sense as I don't use it anymore and disable it by putting (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) inside early-init.el. So I deleted the elpa folder, restarted emacs but now emacsclient -c tries to create a new frame but it gets crashed instantly without any error message. Restoring elpa folder solves the issue!
 There is no mention to elpa folder in my configs.
 How could I debug the issue?

 I don't think this is the right approach. Because It seems that changing "placeholder" for every hypothesis is extremely inefficient. There should be a better way.
 Can anyone suggest a way that I can think in "type language" way? 
 To give a more concrete example, consider the following scenario. 
 say you are using scala, you want to test a function for a case that only return int (maybe the function that you want to use only return int type.), but the function ultimattely accepts generic type. To test this function that return int in typed language, I have to always change signature to always fit my "testing hypothesis" that only care about int. I think you should get an idea now. because one need to change signature when testing certain hypothesis, I don't think it is a sufficient strategy. There must be a better way. Any idea? or debugging technique you use in this scenario.

 I've been an emacs user since around 1981. My .emacs still has some snippets from those days. I've used org-mode for literate multi-language programming and went through a phase some years ago where I used it for task tracking, but it was never quite satisfying. 
 I've been journaling and taking notes (personal and work) since the '90s, for about the last decade on OneNote. It's got excellent sync (win/mac/android/web), a word-processor-like UI, and fast, accurate search. But a few things finally made me switch away: totally vendor-locked-in data format (the big one), lack of easy tagging and links, and no proper source blocks - as a software dev, I felt that every day.
 So a few months ago I switched to logseq: it promises Markdown and/or org-mode …]]></summary>

 In the org file, which I export, the date is specified correctly using the C-c ., like so:
 #+TITLE: Document Title #+AUTHOR: Author Name #+DATE: <2022-03-17 Thu>

Most software adds datetime to the beginning of the file name. It looks tidy. But a series of numbers means a little to human. If I browse through the file names in a small window of a file manager, I can only see the digits without meaningful titles.
The advantages of placing datetime to the beginning of file names is tidy and sortable. I think.
Any thought from you is appreciated. Do you think it is a good idea to append the datetime after, what is the pros and cons?]]></summary>

 I'm from an autocracy country and due to strong opposition of the ideology and pessimism of its prospect in the future decades, I hope to immigrate to a western country to start over a new life.
 I have been working as a data engineer for about six years. And at present, I'm working for a foreign-invested company, using Scala as my working language writing Spark code, complicated UDFs, etc. However there seem not have a movement of people from global and my local company.
 My second language is English. In addition, I started a family in my native country and have two girls aged 4 and 1.
 I want to ask, if to become an immigrant to an English speaking country, what should be my next move? Should I apply for a Scala job remotely and then go abroad to work? Thank you so much.

WebAssembly code generation GHC, we need to compile GHC’s runtime

to pass Haskell functions as callback to C functions. As the
implementation of libffi depends on the platform, we’ve had to port
it to WebAssembly.
This blog post introduces libffi, the challenges to make it
work with WebAssembly, demonstrates our implementation, and also
explains how it’s used by GHC runtime. I hope our implementation can

 I have the following workflow:
 I put all my papers in the folder /papers/some.pdf.
 To not loose track, I also create a todo in my /toread.org which links to file:./papers/some.pdf and some more notes.
 When I finally have time to read this paper, I copy the todo (from toread.org) using (org-copy-subtree) and then (org-yank) it in a newly created file /summaries/somepapernotes.org
 The problem is that the link to file:./papers/some.pdf won't work in /summaries/somepapernotes.org. It will point to /summaries/papers/some.pdf which doesn't exist. So I have to manually edit the link to file:../papers/some.pdf
 This manual step is annoying the deeper the hierarchy is. Is there a better way which adjusts the relative links automatically when I move subtrees up and down the hierarchy?

 I am using org-ref-url-html-to-bibtexto append a bibtex entry to my bib file using a URL. What I also would like is to generate a hyperlink from URL with the text corresponding to the main title in the URL link (I am a researcher and would use such a function for my to-read list of publications in org mode, at the moment I create each hyperlink manually). Do you know if that exists anywhere, of it is even possible to get stable results from such a function?
 ​
 Thank you a lot in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone. I am learning about programming with monads. I discovered the following while traversing a data structure with a State monad, but it's easier to demonstrate with the IO monad. 
 If I use boolean operators, they will only evaluate the arguments that they need. e.g.: 
 Prelude> False && undefined False Prelude> True && undefined *** Exception: Prelude.undefined 
 So far, so good. This is what you'd expect. However, if I use the liftM group of functions to lift && to a monad, this no longer works. e.g.:
 falsify :: IO Bool falsify = putStrLn "It is a falsehood." >> return False verify :: IO Bool verify = putStrLn "Verily, it is so." >> return True liftedAnd :: Monad m => m Bool -> m Bool -> m Bool liftedAnd = liftM2 (&&) 
 Then, calling it in ghci:
 *Main> falsify `liftedAnd` verify It is a falsehood. Verily, it is so. False 
 So, you can't use liftedAnd for flow control. It's easy enough to write an AND function that behaves properly:
 mAnd :: Monad m => m Bool -> m Bool -> m Bool mAnd x y = x >>= \b -> if b then y else return False 
 Now, in ghci:
 *Main> falsify `mAnd` verify It is a falsehood. False 
 So, my questions are:
  
Would someone please explain why liftM2 behaves this way?
 Is there somewhere in the standard libraries to look for properly behaved && || if/then/else etc. for monads?
 Am I missing some key fact about liftM2? Perhaps I am not using it in the intended way.

 Any resources on this would be great, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years I began to learn Haskell using codeanywhere.com, which was a remote development environment that I was comfortable with for creating web services (I variously switch from Mac to Windows to Chromeos as my personal device). As I recall, I could follow the standard stack installation and do pretty much whatever I wanted without issue. After some interruption (life) I have returned to codeanywhere.com to restart my journey but I'm finding that the IDE has changed and I am unable to install or use GHCI without running into errors in the process. 
 I put in a support ticket and was told to use their Haskell vscode extensions in the IDE, but I'm completely lost and haven't found a simple tutorial to explain what I'm supposed to do or how to use them. 
 As an alternative, I can certainly install on a local machine or a VPS, but I feel like I'm missing something obvious with codeanywhere.com. Does anyone have experience working on this platform? What obvious thing am I missing here?

 But I don't want to have my home directory as a lsp-workspace-folder.

This allows me to reliably find time bottlenecks in my code.
 The problem is that I have to manually factor out my code into all these separate {-# SCC #-} functions.
 Are there any plans to do what I suggested in the title? It would be cool if I could select lines of code and have them marked to automatically get factored out into a function of name e.g. func_{FILENAME:LINE}.
 Can anyone here add this? (How much would this cost?)

 move :: (Modifiable a, Modifiable a', ...???) => a -> a' -> IO () move b b' = get b >>= set b' ```

 My question is this just because of my laptop config or is emacsgcc compile real slow?
 By the way, I'm a noob with emacs so please be polite.

On my personal mac, it takes about 5-7 seconds to start up (which seems a bit long, but tolerable). On my work mac, on the other hand, startup is about 90s. This wasn't always the case. It initially ran the same on both computers, but one day it suddenly slowed down. I don't remember if I did anything to break it, but the config file is the same on both. 
 I ran the esup profiler and it tells that the total user startup time is 0.123 sec, which is obviously not true (or the the slowdown is not due to the config file). 
 Any idea on what might be going on or how to accurately profile the startup process?

 $ /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs 2022-03-15 21:34:51.135 Emacs-x86_64-10_14[6713:94719] It's not legal to call -layoutSubtreeIfNeeded on a view which is already being laid out. If you are implementing the view's -layout method, you can call -[super layout] instead. Break on void _NSDetectedLayoutRecursion(void) to debug. This will be logged only once. This may break in the future. 
 Of course, I can suppress these warnings by redirecting outputs to /dev/null, but I didn't get such warnings on Big Sur. Is there anyway to fix this warning instead of just redirecting the warnings to /dev/null?
 Thanks!

 Still, the question remains for me. Why do so many influential emacs users come from the Apple ecosystem? One theory I guess is that the advent of Apple computers and the popularity of emacs coincided. In addition, the similarity of the philosophical origin of these two products can be another reason. What is your opinion?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have switched from Company to Corfu but I am having difficulty getting the binding "C-k" to work as corfu previous. I use evil-mode so this would be a useful binding.
 My corfu setup is:
 (use-package corfu :straight t :defer t :diminish :bind (:map corfu-map ("TAB" . corfu-next) ([tab] . corfu-next) ("S-TAB" . corfu-previous) ([backtab] . corfu-previous) ("C-j" . corfu-next) ("C-k" . corfu-previous))) 
 "C-j" works completely fine, but "C-k" executes the action evil-insert-digraph (not entirely sure what that does...).
 Any suggestions are appreciated!

If you want to edit it yourself, I've got the original .drawio file in the gist too, but it only renders as text. You'd have to save it and open it with https://www.diagrams.net/ or the application you can download from there.
 I am still trying to figure out the best presentation of the printable version, so any general suggestions will be very much appreciated. The aim is to have something that will be visible and useful printed on a sheet of Letter or A4 paper, viewed from about 3 feet away. (in other words, the distance from my eyes to the patch of wall where I've got a copied pinned up!)

 Trying to do more with emacs, I wanted to integrate my conda environments into my workflow. I spotted the conda.el package, and tried to install it with use-package : elisp (use-package conda :ensure t :init (setq conda-anaconda-home (expand-file-name "~/miniconda3")) (setq conda-env-home-directory (expand-file-name "~/miniconda3")) :config (conda-env-initialize-interactive-shells) (conda-env-initialize-eshell))  This does not pose any issue when evaluated (and I've checked on github, people do it that way). My miniconda install is indeed in ~/miniconda3. However, when I try to execute M-x conda-env-activate, I get the following message : Symbol's value as variable is void : proper-dir
 Has anyone any idea how to fix this? Or is there another way to activate conda environments inside of emacs?

 I am able to compile org without generating the info files, but encounter difficulties getting EMACS to autoload org-mode from the `lisp/` directory correctly. 
 Any suggestions would be appreciated, or a better place to seek help. Thanks in advance.
 Org on people, org on.

 I use Linux at work but Windows on my personal laptop, which I still use for development. Yeah I know, everyone says developing on Windows sucks, but Git Bash fits decently well into my usual VS Code workflow, and until now I haven't run into any issues big enough to need to dual-boot or use WSL. But with setting up a dev environment for Scala 3, I tried setting it up through Coursier as recommended and ran into a bunch of problems/annoyances with the installed tools. (I then tried the same thing on my Linux work laptop and everything worked smoothly right off the bat.) Here's some of the issues:

 It seems to me that uuid is "the way to go" for creating IDs for linking since they are guaranteed unique, and will survive movement of a heading to another tree or file. Right?
 So I'm just starting to get into the whole linking-thingy in org mode, and it seems like I'll need to call org-id-get-create just about every time before org-store-link. Rather than make both calls each time, would it make sense to create a new function, my-org-id-get-create-and-store-link, so it simply calls both functions? Could someone help me with a function that will do both id creating and link storing?
 I do have the following set:
 (setq org-id-link-to-org-use-id t) 
 Such a function must have been done before a thousand times, right? Or am I missing something in terms of id creation and workflow?

 def mapFile(filePath:String): Map[String, Int] = { Source.fromFile(filePath).getLines().map { line => line.split(" ").map{ word=> (word,1) }.toMap.withDefaultValue(0) } } 
 Basically, 1st I try to iterate over the lines of the file, and then iterate over each word that is obtained when the line is splitted by spaces. The problem that this is returning me Iterator[scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int]], not Map[String, Int], so Im getting and error.
 Any idea how could I get the desired Map with all the words and 1 values?
 An example would be having the following file as input:
 hello this is a test bye 
 And the output should look like:
 Map("hello" -> 1, "this" -> 1 , "is" -> 1 , "a" -> 1 , "test" -> 1 , "bye" -> 1)

It's the opposite though: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.6.0.4/docs/src/Control.Monad.Trans.Maybe.html#MaybeT
 newtype MaybeT m a = MaybeT { runMaybeT :: m (Maybe a) } 
 I would have expected "Maybe (m a)" instead of "m (Maybe a)"
 All the others I checked are similar (StateT and ExcepT).
 Is there a hand wavy explanation for that ? I can see that monad and transformer laws apply, but I don't really understand why it's this way.

 Hope you're doing great. I'm using Emacs for about 15 years (So basically a rookies in scale of Emacs :P). Based on my experience over the years and specially in the recent times, not many people know about the wonderful world of Emacs and why it is such a fascinating tool. To me they are missing out a chance to enjoy Emacs. So, a while ago I've decided to create a video series and talk about Emacs Lisp in context of a long running project to create an "editor" with Emacs Lisp, In hope to help more people to enjoy the tool that changed the way I use computers and brought me joy over all these years.
 Yesterday, I recorded the 4th episode of the video series. I thought to myself that It might be a good idea to share it on this subreddit as well. I have a looooooong term plan for this series and looking forward to your feedback.

 I‘m immensely grateful for inline-java, and soon JVM‘s own FFI will improve over JNI, which is great in its own right. But do we have something for embedding C# code as well? Or some stable IPC to CLR or some other integrated way with little overhead that’s more robust than crude subprocessing or RPC?

 I've just updated to 27.1 on Ubuntu 21.10, and I'm encountering some weird behaviour with "M-.'
 Basically, it pops up a small "text bubble" where I can type a macro, which can get executed with enter. (See screenshot)
 I cannot figure out which commando is bound to M-. so I can disable it. Describe-key does not seem to work and overwriting it does not seem to help either
 My previous behavior was that M-. was bound to xref-find-definitions.

 Does anyone know what could be wrong here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For certain reasons I am switching from LSP-mode to Eglot. I am a Python developer who works a lot with conda environments. Sometimes I will open a python file before realising I am in the wrong conda environment. This means the LSP server (pyright) started with LSP-mode uses the wrong Python interpreter, not giving completions for libraries which are envionment-specific.
 For this reason, in LSP-mode, I had:
 (add-hook 'conda-postactivate-hook (lambda () (lsp-restart-workspace)))
 I cannot find the equivalent for Eglot. If I do:
 (add-hook 'conda-postactivate-hook (lambda () (eglot-reconnect)))
 Note I am using the conda.el package for conda environment switching.
 This does not work, instead I get the error "Error running timer: Process EGLOT (test/python-mode) not running"
 Is there a way for me to cleanly restart Eglot in the buffer as though I had changed environments before visiting the file? Note, if I change environments first and then open the file, Eglot is correctly started in the proper environment.
 Any help appreciated!

 I have been looking at the distage example (https://github.com/7mind/distage-example), and it looks very promising for writing effectful programs that work both with ZIO and cats-effect as the effect implementation. Although I do wonder if the same can be achieved by defining the APIs in terms of a trifunctor effect, instead of the bifunctor effect type showcased in the example.
 Would appreciate any input on this or links to further related materials.

 Basically, just write out a line and then a Latex export block. The first line can be used to control the font size, by setting scaled to be whatever you want, it is set to 1.5 in this case. I cant seem to change the font size of the export latex block. You can see in this picture below:

 The body text is gigantic but the latex export font is not affected. How do I change this font size globally? I have a lot of these Latex export in my real document, and would like to know how to do that. 
 Appreciate all the help.

Would it be at all possible for me to remove both using a single command, say, org-remove-link-and-trash-linked-file? For a safety measure, I'd rather use move-file-to-trash than to actually delete the associated file. 
 I already have this function to trash the current file, which works on my system (Linux Manjaro):
 (defun my-move-to-trash () (interactive) (if (y-or-n-p "Trash this file?") (progn (setq this-buffer buffer-file-truename) (move-file-to-trash (buffer-file-name)) (kill-current-buffer) (message "%s was trashed" this-buffer))) nil))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a project that I'm working on for managing projects, I'm calling it projectwarrior (because it is built to integrate with taskwarrior). I want to add a project open command which would check org-roam for a node associated with this project and create one if it can't find one (The idea is that this node would contain the project's support material a la GTD). I had originally thought to use org-roam-protocol's roam-ref, but I think I don't understand how the file-ref which org-roam-protocol requires works.
 It seems intended mostly for citation purposes, which I think could work (maybe there'd be a way to get from emacs back to the projectwarrior project eventually?). But to do that, I think I'd need to write some sort of custom citation format. Unfortunately my Google-fu is failing me at the moment, as searching "new org-ref protocol", "custom org-roam-ref citation format" and several other related results hasn't brought up any results that pointed me in the right direction. So, here's the question(s):
  
Is there a way I can suppress the warnings from org-roam when I put a ref that is plaintext? This isn't actually my preferred solution, but I figure I'd start here.
 Is there a place I can find instructions on how to create a custom whatever-it-is that org-roam is expecting in the ref field?
 Is there another approach to opening (or creating if necessary) an org-roam node from the command line? Would something like emacsclient (open-this-node <node-uuid>) that might be simpler and easier to create?
  
Thank you in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working at a quite well known startup in my country as a Data Engineer for more than 2 years. Primarily I do Data Analysis, because of my academic Machine Learning background, which makes my role closer to Data Scientist. 
 However, I am interested to work on Distributed System, Databases, and Stream Processing- that is Distributed Data Systems in broad. I wrote a Microservice in Golang in my current workplace. But I do not think this experience is sufficient to get hired as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems.
 I guess, after talking to some other Data Engineers and going through job posts, a project that involves mocking data streams, data ingestion with Kafka, data processing with Flink, serving with ad-hoc Scala microservices, containerization with Docker, and deploying on a Kubernetes (MiniKube perhaps?) cluster might help. What else to add or remove?
 What may I do to learn and later get hired to work as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 [Disclaimer] I just started learning Scala. So I hope this question is not too basic.
 I'm doing the Advent of Code 2021 challenges to get a feeling for the language. Day 2 is a task where we have to parse a file, where each line contains a command. Each command updates one of 2 variables. I've tried to implement this using a functional programming style. I convert the commands to (Int, Int) tuples, where each element is a delta introduced by the command. Then, I need to sum these tuples element-wise (like a vector sum). Doing this sum was not very nice, because Scala seems to disallow tuple destructuring in (anonymous) function parameter position. Am I missing something?
 Also, do you have suggestions how I could make my code more idiomatic? I would love to hear them!
 Thank you in advance!
  def problem1_tuples(input: Iterator[String]): Int = { // input is an iterator of lines val (position, depth) = input.map(s => ( applyRegex(s,forward_pattern), // returns update for first value in tuple or 0 applyRegex(s,down_pattern) - applyRegex(s,up_pattern) // update for second value )).fold((0,0))((a,b) => (a._1 + b._1, a._2 + b._2)) // this is *ugly* position * depth // the challenge asks for the product }

 I have a minimal example org file (under 4k, just ~70 citations and an '#+bibliography:' line which points to a fairly large (~10MB) bibtex file. This minimal org-file takes ~10 seconds to open with emacs -Q on a modern laptop with 8 cores and 16GB memory, after which there are further delays when scrolling.

 Is this bad? How would I make this more FP style? Is there some Free Monad/type system magic I could use here?

 That can get very confusing esp if you have a few slash alternatives in one or more headlines. If I were given the choice between reserving the slash char for my human-readable org headlines vs. used in the completion tree syntax, I'd rather the completion tree syntax look more like this:
 Standard Tasks%Buy/Return% 
 or perhaps:

 But if I have to live with it, I guess I could use the pipe char

 This time I wrote on Cape!
 I highly recommend using cape to those who use corfu. It provides many useful completion-at-point-functions as well as transformers such as cape-capf-buster and cape-capf-silent. My favorite is cape-company-to-capf which converts company backends to completion-at-point-functions! This was the killer feature for me.
 Though this post is less thorough and has less "developed" code than my previous two posts, I hope a few of you still find it useful :)
 Edit: Some of you may notice the website redesign. I hope it adds clarity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't possible, but I'm trying to include parts of a code block in another and not the whole thing like you usually do. E.g. only line 1 to 5 or something, but not 6 through 10.
 From the docs, I see it's possible to pass parameters, but I'm not sure if the same can be done for including a code block limited to certain line numbers. Couldn't find much online and stack exchange is down for maintenance right now too.
 If I'm explaining it badly I basically want to do like:
 #+name: test #+start_src :noweb yes Line1 Line2 Line3 Line4 #+end_src #+start_src <<test(line1-2)>> #+end_src 
 So I get:
 #+start_src Line1 Line2 #+end_src 
 I can live without it, but it'd be nice to not need to split up the code block when I'm doing cursed code additions.
 Also, I'm on my phone. Sorry if it looks horrible or the syntax is all wrong.

 Googling tells me that Solo is a singleton tuple, but it is not clear to me what is the usefulness of having a singleton tuple over just an unwrapped value, and if the singleton tuple is important why isn't there some behind-the-scene-syntactic-sugar-magic to use the usual brackets notation for tuples also for singleton tuples?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm looking into writing some new functionality for emacs and as part of it need to be able to dynamically highlight individual characters, I've looked into messing with font-lock-mode briefly but that seems to be more geared to syntax highlighting based on regex. 
 I also tried using put-overlay and am now trying the highlight.el package but the way I've written it so far doesn't actually work and I'm not sure why. Can anyone point me in a better direction if this ain't the way/tell me where I'm screwing up?
 first I define a face:
 (defface position-1-face '((t (:foreground "#FF0000" :weight bold))) "The face for the first increment out of from the cursor" :group 'increment-faces) 
 Then I apply it like this
 (when (<= plus (point-max)) (hlt-highlight-region plus plus 'position-1-face)) (when (>= neg (point-min)) (hlt-highlight-region neg neg 'position-1-face)) 
 Where plus and neg are values that are 10 characters from the current point in either direction. My eventual goal with this is to have characters like 10, 20 and 30 characters out from the cursor highlighted so I can jump around more easily without having to figure out distances. 
 I know the faces are getting applied from the output of describe-char but they do not seem to actually show up.
 Ideally I'd like to drop the dependence on highlight.el so if there is a better built in way then please do let me know

Syntax Highlighting
 Auto completion
 Support for Arduino and Teensy
  
What I have tried
  
https://github.com/arduino/arduino-language-server - It needs modification of lsp-mode though, as it doesn't support passing cli arguments ootb
 https://github.com/motform/arduino-cli-mode and https://github.com/yuutayamada/company-arduino/ - Together they seem somewhat fine, but as soon as the project has a few .c/.cpp files the .ino triggered arduino-cli-mode poofs.
  
What I want to avoid
 Installing an IDE, I want to stay with emacs as far as possible. I don't like chonky bloated IDEs
 Other options
 https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile - How with the above mentioned QOL though
 Note: I'm very unfamiliar with elisp, I can do very basic things via trial and error while copying other stuff from my config.
 Do you have any idea what could be done here? I have tried everything I could.
 Thanks!

Install Msys2
 In Msys2 terminal, install libgccjit. Add to $PATH if it's not already there.
 Download emacs 28 or 29 from GNU: https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/ and run it. I used 28.0.91 build.
  
The snapshot Emacs binaries are compiled with native comp. It just works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry guys if I am being annoying, but I got another problem that I cannot figure out by myself.
 As stated previously I was following the old emacs from scratch series from system crafters youtube channel to customize my emacs and it throws of error along with the line loading file .../elpa/bind-key-number.number/bind-key.elc failed to provide feature 'bind-key'
 So, at first, I thought I may don't have the package but when I tried installing it I was failing. So I searched the web a bit and found this bind-key file from tumashu/elpa git repo. So I copied it and pasted it in my bind-key.elpa file. After evaluating the buffer if I re-evaluate my init buffer everything seems to work. But if I re-start emacs the error comes back again which again goes off after re-evaluating the said buffers. 
 Is there any permanent fix for this problem? What am I doing wrong?

 First I thought maybe I haven't installed the font so I installed it using pacman. It installed it in "/usr/share/fonts/TTF/FiraCode-Retina".
 Now how do I use this font in emacs?
 (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "?")
 What do I put in the position of ?. I have tried putting the font name. Font name along with its absolute path. And some other variations. But everytime it just says font not found!
 Thank you for your help.

 Ok, that was a stupid mistake on my part.
 I just used "Fira Code Retina" and it seems to work. Sorry for the trouble!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I am customizing a Nord theme. The problem is that the face for hl-line kinda looks too much like the face for when you try to select a text using evil visual mode (press V)/. If without evil mode, this same face can also be shown if you just drag select using mouse. This is what I meant on a Nord theme:
 ​
 Nothing selected, just hl-line highlighting current line
 ​
 You can barely see the word VISUAL under Visual mode in vim (pressing V)
 ​
 Again, here I drag and select the word VISUAL using the mouse. Hard to see
 To see things clearly, I use a different light theme:
 ​
 Normal with only hl-line face color
 ​
 Here you can see both the hl-line and the vim Visual/drag select very clearly.
 Question: What is that face name, he one you drag select/highlight using evil? I tried to do an M-x customize and type "evil" but I got are something like evil-ex-search
 Any input is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[imo FRP is so so good. Its paradigm feels extremely natural in a way beyond the complexity of its encoding would suggest. eg looking at the implementation of reflex a few times, it seems to basically implement an entire runtime system on top of haskell's runtime system.
 On one hand it's very cool that haskell is flexible enough to implement a runtime system as a library, but I wonder if there's gains to be made in something more wired in (eg in terms of optimization, simplifying compile times, simplifying types, etc.) - it always struck my as a bit hacky.
 I know elm used to have builtin FRP but dropped it (I don't recall exactly why - any insight here would help!)
 Perhaps a proper "dataflow" language - though my (poorly informed) impression is that these are all way more special purpose and I've been spoiled by the full power of haskell.
 What do you think?
 EDIT: Looking into it more now - I redescovered this explanation of why Elm dropped FRP. It's honestly pretty disappointing - I understand from a developer UX perspective this simplifies a lot of things, but I'm not a fan of the redux "smash-everything-into-one-type" pattern - and a big draw for FRP is having the control flow represent dependency locality rather than synchronizing everything on one monlithic state

 I have a type Contact defined as follows :

 I have a function in which I want to take some information about a Person to create a new Contact (with State = Good), and add it to a list of contacts, which looks like this :
  addContact :: Person -> [Contact] -> [Contact] addContact p c = c ++ (p, Good) 
 Compiler is complaining with the following message : Couldn't match expected type [Contact] with actual type (Person, State)
 But given that I have defined that Contact is a tuple with (Person, State), how am I supposed to declare that it is indeed a Contact? I can't seem to be able to create an instance of it because it's not a data type, just a type.

I am writing a book and would like some feedbacks and best practices from you, regarding the method and organization.
I use now The Archive app and Google Docs.
Here is my organization:
I have a master file (a structure note) containing the outline of the book, ie the different chapters. Each chapter is a link in the structure note.
In the structure note, I put also some misc notes, like research notes.
I put a special tag in the filename of the chapters (like @b1 for book number 1).
I can check the total number of words up to date with the shell command: wc -w *@b1*.md
The step I didn't like very much is that I need to edit and compile the chapters in another tool. I use Google docs for that. Each time I find a mistake in my content, I need to modify the content in Google Docs and in The Archive app (source of my content). Not very efficient.
Please comment my workflow and share your practices :-)
Thanks]]></summary>

I'm concerned that archives may grow too big and wondered if this could be automatic or if it's just something I should do manually.
  
The second question is harder (for me). I'm trying to set up my capture templates such that every day is the date in ISO format plus the day of the week, so a capture would make a subheading under 2022-03-11 FRIDAY. 
 This is probably not going to be super hard, but the org manual is.... vague on how I would do it. The "hard" one is, I'd like to have another template that puts the subheading underneath not only the date but another subheading. So you'd wind up with:
 * 2022-03-11 FRIDAY ** Log *** Entered Subheading Text, Text [Entered at [TIMESTAMP]] 
 I have no idea how to even begin to do this, because I'm not sure of several things. 
 1) How to make emacs give the initial heading as an ISO date rather than a datetree
 2) How to make it double up on headings so I get Log
 3) How to make this all respect my extend-day-until setting, because I go to bed WAY after midnight
 I'm meandering here but I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction. Thank you in advance.

(and similarly a >>= (b >>= (c >>= d)) is equivalent to
  
do r1 <- a r2 <- b r1 r3 <- c r2 d r3 
 The bind operator makes a functions input be wrapped in the same thing as the output by unwrapping the value before each chained function.
 E.G.

 Is this the reverse? It unwraps rather than wraps the output. And it only works for IO types? I've got the impression that IO is special is this unique to the io type?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[org-mac-image-paste — Paste images and cropped PDF clips directly into org files.
 emacs-mac only
 I've been trying to switch to Org-mode for note-taking, coming from Evernote, Notes.app, etc. I love the organizational power and security of plain text, but one thing I could never understand: why can't I just directly paste image/PDF data into an org file?
 I use this literally all the time, accumulating graphs, formulae, small screenshots, images from papers, websites, manuscripts, etc. The other key feature I needed was that cropped PDF data remained exactly that: a PDF file on disk. This is because I may later use it in talks, white-papers, etc., where preserving the vector quality is crucial.
 So, after some time trying (and failing) to convince myself such functionality must already exist, I wrote up a small package. Note that it unfortunately works only with the excellent emacs-mac variant, which provides (some) information about image data on the clipboard. I'm hopeful similar more general functionality could come to emacs/org in the future.

 I have 1 year of experience as a research engineer and, I am studying scala to switch my career to a distributed system(DS) engineer within this year.
 Currently, I am following the scala course of Coursera, but many posts in this subreddit mention various scala frameworks. I want to know that it is necessary to cover famous frameworks like akka, ZIO, spark.
 I am not afraid to learn, but I just want to set priorities.
 Are there some frameworks or packages, which are commonly used in scala?
 (Like node of javascript Or NumPy, scikit-learn in Python. )
 Sometimes I check a job description of scala keyword on Linkedin, but many of them do not mention what they want to an applicant (They just say like "we prefer scala" or "we use scala")
 So I am wondering where I have to focus to be a distributed system engineer.
 I studied distributed systems in graduate school, so my goal is to implement some DS toy projects using scala.
 Could I ask for advice to be a DS engineer?
 Thank you for reading :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Haskell-ers!
 I'm looking to implement a JSON linter and would appreciate some library / architecture suggestions. Some examples of the kind issues i'm interested in detecting are:
  
The field "base_path", if it exists, cannot use Windows paths, must be POSIX
 The field "date_created" must be in ISO8601
 etc.
  
I'm capable of writing the linter rules (i.e. detect date formats, path formats etc.), what I need help with is the IO / initial parsing phase. I'm familiar with parser-combinators (attoparsec has been my goto previously) but never before had a use case that cares about where the parsing failed. I've also used aeson a couple of times for handling JSON.
 The defining requirement is that, once an issue has been identified, the linter must report the location of the error including line number(s) and column numbers (start and end). It can be assumed that the data is valid JSON and conforms to the expected schema (i.e. if we expect a "date_created" field, it'll be there. I'm interested in format/quality issues rather than validating structure / syntax.
 Otherwise, the only requirement is that it be quick / run in parallel - It must be able to run over thousands of files in a couple of minutes.
 My initial plan was to use something like pipes-aeson for IO (not used a streaming library before but seems straightforward enough) however it seems that aeson is based on attoparsec and the parse-error is just a plain string without source locations.
 So, finally, to some questions.
  
Anybody have recommendations for parsing JSON (quickly) while keeping track of the source-locations of each field / key / value / object etc.
 Can streaming libraries like pipes be used to process the loaded files in parallel? Pointers / articles etc. covering this would be much appreciated!

 You don’t have to have Elm or Haskell experience, but it will help :)
 You do need to have interest in functional programming, but you probably wouldn’t be in this subreddit if you didn’t, now would you?
 Our shared working hours are 10 AM to 3 PM Eastern, you do need to be available during those hours, though we're flexible if something comes up.
 $100,000-$120,000 but do not quote me on the compensation, that is from memory for our associate level, it could be less or more by $10,000.
 The job description is for a mid-level, we don't have an associate FP job description. But just the technologies and the level are different, everything else should be the same.

 Hello,
 I am learning Haskell as part of a comp-sci course at University and have come across a wierd error when I try to build a package using cabal. 
 When I run cabal install, the installation fails due to the package wai-logger-2.4.0 not being able to build due to the package cabal-doctest-1.0.9 being broken with the specific error: 
 "Could not find module Distributive.Extra.Doctest"
 How can I fix this error?
 I have tried the following: 1. Reinstall cabal-doctest 2. Reinstall distributive 3. Delete and reinstall all cabal packages after running cabal update 4. Reinstall ghc
 Thanks in advance.

 I'm currently creating a project which I wanted to try using opaleye for DB access in. I have an M1 Mac with 16GB of RAM and use ghc-8.10.7 by stack-2.7.5, both installed through ghcup.
 Soon after starting to build product-profunctors, I get an error
 -- While building package product-profunctors-0.11.0.3 (scroll up to its section to see the error) using: /Users/mateusz/.stack/setup-exe-cache/aarch64-osx/Cabal-simple_mPHDZzAJ_3.2.1.0_ghc-8.10.7 --builddir=.stack-work/dist/aarch64-osx/Cabal-3.2.1.0 build --ghc-options " -fdiagnostics-color=always" Process exited with code: ExitFailure (-9) (THIS MAY INDICATE OUT OF MEMORY) 
 When I rerun, I get the same result in a few secs. It must be very quick, as I don't see any visible spike in memory usage on monitor (it oscillates around 9-10GB). /usr/bin/time -l shows rss of 200MB, but I guess it's stack's usage, not ghc's.
 That's strange to me as I compile a 300+ deps project at my work in a similar amount of RAM without problems, and I have also compiled stack on my 4GB Raspberry Pi (which took a lot of time, but didn't outofmemory either). Is this package really that heavy, or there's something wrong with my installation?

 So I am trying to find an easy way of summarizing what I did do on a particular day or week.
 I am mostly using Todos/Tasks that I mostly complete through the Agenda view, but I also log smaller tasks, questions, stuff that showed up within the journal (C-c c j).
 What I am looking for is a way to just summarize all Todos that were closed and journal entries made on a particular day in one output.
 I looked a bit at clock table, but as I am not looking for "time spent" but rather "what did I do - what was closed and logged?" it doesn't seemt to be the right tool.

 I was a long time emacs user (5+ years), but left a few years ago at the start of my PhD, my main reason for abandoning was to move to VS code simply for easier use of jupyter notebooks. 
 I need them to be easily sharable, so using ORG as a replacement isn't viable for me. 
 Spell check, autocomplete and documentation are also very important to me. 
 Does anyone have a good setup for editing Jupyter notebooks directly, without converting between formats in emacs? 
 If so, could you share your workflow, I'd be very keen to get back into emacs. 
 Thanks,

 Hey org-mode lovers,
 Have you ever been in the following situation?
 You have tried to understand a specific aspect of org-mode (say a command) and you have done the following:
  
you have played with the command (writing your own examples),
 you have read all the parts in the manual dealing with this command,
 you have read the docstring of the command,
 you have looked for explanations on the web,
 you even have read the source code of the command,
  
but you still haven't figured it out after all the efforts.
 I've been in that situation and I thought it would be easier if there were more examples.
 BUT THERE ARE MORE EXAMPLES.
 We just have to change our lenses to see them.
 What if we looked at org-mode tests as example…]]></summary>

 #+begin_src #+end_src 
 How do I make these headers to be capitalized? I have checked all my configs and there are no lines that said something about making the headers lower case. Interestingly, the Org website section 1.5 said that the default behavior should be capitalized, not lower case: https://orgmode.org/org.html
 There is this answer here but to switch to lower case instead: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/34931/org-source-block-in-lowercase
 So I decide to experiment with the "accepted" answer and tried with upcase
 (mapc (lambda (arg) (setcdr arg (list (upcase (cadr arg))))) org-structure-template-alist) 
 This yields error about wrong type argument listp, export ascii which is the list of argument/header to be inserted in the variable: org-structure-template-alist
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

I'm aware of Orgzly and I use it on my own phone but I don't think it's simple enough for someone who's not invested in making it work.
 I found a github repo for syncing with Wunderlist but learned that Wunderlist shut down 2 years ago.
 For some things (e.g. events), we can use a shared calendar and I already have such a setup going with org-caldav-sync. I was wondering if there's something similar people use for to-do lists, shopping lists, etc...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write a type class that will convert one type of error into another, e.g. Exception e => e -> Error. I'd like it to work for "wrapped" errors as well for convenience, e.g. Exception e => Either e a -> Either Error a. But I can't seem to get around the problem of conflicting instances.
 (if you prefer code in a gist: https://gist.github.com/evanrelf/f5773113b3a50e3aee7f44ba2cc05ea5)
 The error type's implementation isn't important, so we'll use a trivial one here:
 data Error = Error deriving stock Show deriving anyclass Exception 
 I tried using functional dependencies:
 class ToError i o | i -> o where toError :: i -> o instance Exception e => ToError e Error where toError :: e -> Error toError = undefined instance Exception e => ToError (Either e a) (Either Error a) where toError :: Either e a -> Either Error a toError = undefined 
 ...but I get an error:
 Functional dependencies conflict between instance declarations: instance Exception e => ToError e Error instance Exception e => ToError (Either e a) (Either Error a) 
 I also tried using associated type families:
 class ToError a where type Output a :: Type toError :: a -> Output a instance Exception e => ToError e where type Output e = Error toError :: e -> Error toError = undefined instance Exception e => ToError (Either e a) where type Output (Either e a) = Either Error a toError :: Either e a -> Either Error a toError = undefined 
 ...but I get an error:
 Conflicting family instance declarations: Output e = Error Output (Either e a) = Either Error a 
 Adding {-# OVERLAPPING #-} pragmas doesn't make a difference.
 I believe GHC selects instances based on the instance head, not the instance context, so nothing I do on the left side of the fat arrow will make a difference.
 Is there any other way I could formulate this to get my desired functionality, where the output type is determined by the input type?

original introductory blog post blog post, I’ve written about why we, at
Tweag, are developing yet another configuration language. Our goal is to empower
people to write correct, programmable and maintainable configurations. Nickel
targets Nix, Infrastructure-as-Code, build systems, and more. We think such a
tool would greatly help taming the growing complexity of configuring systems.
Since the first blog post, we have made progress. We backed up and changed our
mind sometimes. We had a lot of discussions, and we also experimented quite a
bit. There is still a lot to do and there are many imperfect aspects of the language
to improve.
Still, I think we have reached a point where Nickel is consistent enough for people
to try it mor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am following up on this thread from a year ago and was curious what kind of Emacs to use on a Mac in early 2022. In the past, I used Aquamacs and the standard homebrew version of emacs but have stepped away from Emacs in the past 2 years for various reasons. 
 I now want to give Org-mode another try and thus want to get back at using Emacs. Other than Ord-mode I would mostly use Emacs to write Markdown and LaTeX files and potentially some R. 
 It appears Aquamacs is finally actively maintained again but there seem to be some advantages of sticking to a more "classic" Emacs port. Any recommendations are very much appreciated.

 If I only use the default config (no fancy packages, Melpa, Elpa and the like) would emacs do any network communications on its own as I start it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I'm missing something obvious when trying to split my org-mode emacs config into multiple files.
 Suppose I have two files: full-config.org, which serves as an aggregator of various configurations and specific-config.org, which is a config for any single customization.
 full-config.org contains the following code:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el :noweb yes <<./specific-config.org:disable-indentation>> #+end_src 
 and specific-config.org contains the following:
 #+name: disable-indentation #+begin_src emacs-lisp (setq org-adapt-indentation nil) #+end_src 
 What I expect to see after tangling the full-config.org is (setq org-adapt-indentation nil) in ~/.emacs.d/init.el; however, the file is blank.
 I can tangle the evaluation results of disable-indentation by placing () at the end of noweb, but I cannot figure out how to tangle the code itself.
 Can anyone please tell me if it is possible, and if so, how to do it properly? If it is not possible, is there an alternative way to update code in one "aggregator" file from multiple files without using transclusion?
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been on a quest to decrease my Emacs startup time and found something that I haven't seen mentioned on any of the blogs I came across on the topic. I think it is fairly well known that if you use straight.el, deactivating package.el in your early-init.el will speed up your starting time. What I only just found out is that on launch, straight does a lot of checks to see if any of the packages installed have been altered. This process can be changed by modifying the straight-check-for-modifications variable. I don't edit any of my straight packages by hand, so I have this set to nil, before bootstrapping straight. This brought my startup time from ~2 seconds to ~0.5 seconds, for loading over 200 packages. Maybe there are some reasons why one shouldn't do this that I don't know, but it seems to be a nice way to save some time!
 For more information, see this section of straight's read-me: https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#customizing-when-packages-are-built
 Hopefully this is of help to someone!

Here's one where I once found a list of signal words in text, e.g.: schema, model, allegory, analogy, hypothesis, metaphor, representation, simile, theory.
Source:
Writing as Thinking, Review of General Psychology 1, 2008, Vol. 12, S. 9--27.
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/1089-2680.12.1.9
This is but a piece of the overall Zettelkasten puzzle. Was nice to see English terms for a change back when I read this. Sascha and I practiced hunting for definitions and arguments etc. for a while but I just haven't found any other English source at that time.
Notably absent from the Oatley/Djikic article: a reference to Luhmann  http://luhmann.surge.sh/learning-how-to-read
For trivia, here're the titles of the notes I created that reference this book:

201306160915 Pen as thinking machine
201306160913 Analogy of note-taking to the Turing machine

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[imo Linear types is really cool and could revolutionize how haskell is written (eg alternatives to "builder" patterns, IO monad, bracket functions, "move semantics", etc.)
 But! There's a few factors that seem to make it unusable except for specific safety-centric code (I played with the ergonomics extensively last year by toying with a linear version of prim (eg https://github.com/daig/prim/blob/%E2%98%B8/class/Cmp.hs))
  
Basic quality of life stuff around linearity inference eg in let/where/case binding
 Lack of effective multiplicity polymorphism.
 Lack of sugar for Movable types (eg primitive numeric types, for which copy and move are identical - Ur is not a good solution for these basic types imo)
 Lack of linear primops.
 Lack of optimizations making use of linearity eg to shortcut garbage collection.
 Lack of support for automatic lifetime management (This isn't really essential, but currently it's akin to using manual new and delete with static guarantees - which is great but still cumbersome relative to C++ RAII or Rust's lifetimes, and I believe could be inferred statically. Maybe it's actually possible just with library support for something like a linear ResourceT monad but that still feels a bit unsatisfying)
 As far as I can tell, it's solely the brainchild of Tweag - which is great to have industry support, but worrying in terms of robustness and longterm support as GHC develops. Linear types really needs fairly deep integration with the rest of GHC to be most useful.
  
1/2/3 are the only ones really stopping me from going all-in on linearity right now, but I expect all of them to get resolved eventually so long as 7 isn't an issue.
 So my question is: What's the latest developments on linear types in haskell / who is working on it / what's the best place to keep updated?

 main = print (!readNumber + 5) 
 which is syntactic sugar for
 main = do x <- readNumber print (x + 5) 
 What's nice about ! is that you can nest !s arbitrarily (and mix them with pure code) without needing to name any intermediate results; the desugaring does the sensible depth-first left-to-right evaluation you'd expect. (I'd note that ! is more powerful than the suggestion described here, since the applicative syntax doesn't neatly support nesting; complex expressions end up in a join/pure soup.)
 Anyway, I was just wondering whether the GHC language design team had ever seriously considered porting this? There does seem to be demand for it: many mainstream imperative languages (even JavaScript!) have adopted ! - they just pronounce it await (and it's only applicable in their "promise" monad).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For anyone who uses org-mode to take notes (especially in uni), do you treat an org file as a single note or as an entire notebook? It would be nice to see what other people are doing so I can (possibly) adjust my note-taking strategy.
 Edit my current strategy is: ~/Notes/<Semester>/<Class>/<week>/<day_month_year.org>
 For example ~/Notes/Spring_2022/MAT2440/week6/wednesday_march_9_2022.org
 and ~/Notes is a git repo so I can keep it in sync with my desktop at home (as I have some hybrid (online and in-person) classes and need to keep them in both places)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago I wrote a mini API server in order to let me leave "private comments" on a codebase.
  
Imagine being dropped into a new codebase and having the freedom to leave whatever todo items and breadcrumbs you want without cluttering the codebase. Imagine working on a client’s codebase and not having to worry about what you say, or who sees it.
  
I fully documented what it'd take to write a plugin for your favorite editor and wrote an example plugin for vim ... and then I switched to emacs.
 My emacs lisp chops are NOT up to writing a plugin that speaks to this API and displays the private comments inline. I'm imagining something akin to how magit shows commit messages inline. 
 I'm tired of not having access to this in my main editor. 
 If you or someone you know would be interested in writing this for me (as a public open source package, which i'll be happy to maintain) I'll happily pay you, or maybe donate the equivalent amount to help folks in Ukraine if you'd prefer. DM me here (or @masukomi on twitter) with how much you'd want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a long time vim user that converted (mostly to Emacs). I'm to the point where I only use vim in a few situations (quick edits, specific servers), and I've recreated my old vim config in emacs: 
  
Buffer management-ivy and fzf
 evil keys everywhere
 surround.vim-evil-surround
 vim commentary-evil-commentary
 persistent undo-undo-fu
 web-mode/php-mode
 lots of keybindings like 
  
(evil-define-key 'normal 'global (kbd "<leader><SPC>") 'ivy-switch-buffer) 
 (evil-define-key 'normal 'global (kbd "<leader>e") (lambda() (interactive)(find-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el"))) 
 (evil-define-key 'normal 'global (kbd "<leader>ww") (lambda() (interactive)(find-file "~/notes.org"))) 
 (evil-define-key 'normal 'global (kbd "DEL" ) #'switch-to-last-buffer) 
 I'm pretty satisfied with the workflow, but then I was satisfied with a pretty similar one in vim before. What stuff should I leverage that makes emacs superior to vim? Don't get me wrong, elisp is a million times more pleasant than Vimscript and that alone makes a big difference. Oh, I do use magit and org already so maybe I have my answer. Curious if there are other vim converts out there who have words of wisdom on what else to try in emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a cv in org mode and I want to make a list of publications. The way my cv class works, I use description lists with a date and a description in org mode like this:
 - 2018--2022 :: Job at company 
 which exports to:
 \begin{description} \item[2018--2022] Job at company \end{description} 
 This is then formatted exactly how I like. I really don't want to massively change the way this works, because it took me a long time to get the class just right, I've tried a few approaches (e.g. tables and tabularx) and this was the best way overall (so far).
 I want to be able to write this:
 - [cite:@key_20] - [cite:@otherkey_22] 
 and have it export like this (or equivalent):
 \begin{description} \item[2020] \cite{key_20} \item[2022] \cite{otherkey_22} \end{description} 
 where the dates in the square brackets for the \item macros are automatically pulled from the bib data associated with the relevant @key. (I realise \cite is probably not the best citation command to use here. I use biblatex so I'll probably pick something reasonable from that package. The point is the date thing).
 How would anyone approach this? I've fiddled about a bit and can't find a way yet.

 Anyway what's everyone else's approach to this?

 I'm asking this because I'm new and I'm wondering if I'm fooling myself that font colored levels does anything good. When I "discovered" themes and faces, I got pretty excited at the eye candy. At first, it looked really nice and seemed like a good idea. But now, idk.
 I'm curious, how many org mode level-colors (or other font attributes for levels) do you have? What does your different font attributes for levels mean?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use .emacs-custom.el to contain the customizations made by the interactive functions. However, I'd like to start moving some of that stuff out so I can manage it myself and make comments. I tried pulling some stuff out and putting into my init.el, but it didn't work. Namely, I pulled out these:
 '(org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color "#808080") :foreground "#FF00FF" :background "#f0f0f0")))) '(org-upcoming-deadline ((t (:foreground "#FF33FF")))) '(org-warning ((t (:background "#ffffa0" :foreground "#ff33ff" :weight normal)))) 
 Why don't these work within my init.el? I tried them before and after my (load custom-file).
 EDIT: Ok I see I'm supposed to use set-face-attribute. So I tried wrapping the above, but this doesn't work
 (set-face-attribute 'org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color "#808080") :foreground "#FF00FF" :background "#f0f0f0")))) 
 EDIT 2: I figured out the answer. A correct, commonly used form for set-face-attribute is like this:
 (set-face-attribute 'org-todo nil :box '(:line-width 1 :color "#808080") :weight 'normal :foreground "#FF00FF" :background "#f0f0f0") 
 And it probably didn't work with a straight copy because each of those first three lines, I think those are args to the function (custom-set-faces...). I don't know what it does behind the scenes, but I guess it wants its args in a certain format.

 I assume the simplest way would be to copy the content from the field, create a new buffer, paste the content to the new buffer, then export it to orgmode. But this also seems like a lot of work and I'd like to automate it if possible.
 Additional question for org-roam! I'd like to turn each reference into a node, so I can track each to what references I end up using more, which I tend to co-use, etc. Is there a good way to find every citekey in my bibliography, convert into something that org-ref, org-cite, citar, whatever can understand, and export them as nodes in one file with the citekey being in the :roam-refs: field?

 After looking into those repo, I figured out that these guys have solved problem that I had, am having, and don't even know that I have. 
 So I am now trying to gather all repos from these "emacs super developers", so I can study their code, understand problem that bother them, understand how they solve problem and one day be good enough to continuously contribute to the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, is there an alternative formulation of monad transformers that allow removing any reference to the base monad inside the e.g. bind definition of the transformer ? 
 The reason I'm asking for that is I'm porting some Haskell transformers to Python, for which I would like to avoid chains of lift.lift.lift... 
 A good way I found is simply to make a custom subclass of each transformer in the stack, so that they can be looked up for their lift by "tag" (the specific subclass) rather than numerical position (aka number of lift nesting). That would make composition of function using different monads very easy, even if they have not been designed to work together specifically 
 This would still allows the user to use multiple transformers of the same type (e.g. StateT), since the user can create as many subclasses of StateT they want for each piece of state.
 The problem with that is that if the user uses e.g. SubclassofStateT.pure(42), the base monad is not known , and has to be "resolved" later (when looking up the index of this class in the stack to lift appropriately). Unfortunately automatic, lifting is not enough since the definition of e.g. pure() would require the knowledge of the base monad which we don't have at this stage. Hence the need for an alternative formulation that allows delaying this knowledge to later.
 EDIT: fix typos

The trick will be to get correct OPML file formatting as an output via Marked 2, python, applescript or Keyboard Maestro.
Check this out for a first rough go. So far only one level thick. But this was easy. Each link on the central node is a child node on the mindmap. The full text of each child node is attached. Links within the text are not hot, but we'll see. 
I've attached the file so you can download, review, and explore the ideas. Requires an app that will read iThoughtsX files. This type of download might be a way of sharing a specific idea thread from my ZK with the world.]]></summary>

 We built it to help all people living in oppressive regimes communicate freely with each other, without fear of persecution because of what they said and who they are connected with.
 During the terrible conflict between Russia and Ukraine, people of both countries – I have friends and family there – could be at risk when sharing their opinions or just from being connected to people who were prosecuted.
 Every messenger app that knows who you are can end up sharing all of your connections with undesirable third parties, either as a result of a court order or as a result of attack - so even Signal, which has strong encryption, cannot protect your connection graph.
 Huge "thank you" 🙏 to 137 people who helped us test and improve the apps and to u/angerman who helped a lot by compiling our Haskell code to mobile platforms and getting it accepted by app stores – and we have just submitted the release than makes the app working on iPhone 7.
 From our experience – building mobile apps with Haskell is non-trivial but doable – so if you have complex client-side logic that benefits from the advanced type system, then Haskell is a viable choice – we hope our project makes it a bit better for others too.
 Let us know what you think about the apps and we are looking forward to releasing the new features, e.g. e2e encrypted WebRTC audio/video calls – see the full release announcement here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 Trying to use "assertThrows" as I'm trying to learn about unit testing, but I'm stuck. I made a simple calculator and wrote some tests to test them, they are all fine, simply using assert, but as soon as I want to test that an exception is supposed to be thrown, the test fails with the following error message:
 type mismatch; found : org.scalatest.Assertion (which expands to) org.scalatest.compatible.Assertion required: Int assertThrows[ArithmeticException](calculator.divide(10, 0)) 
 Here is the code I'm using:
 import org.scalatest.flatspec.AnyFlatSpec import calctest.Calculator object ScalaTestingStyles class CalculatorSuite extends AnyFlatSpec { val calculator = new Calculator "Calculator" should "add two numbers" in { assert( calculator.add(10, 5) === 15 ) } it should "subtract two numbers" in { assert( calculator.subtract(10, 5) === 5 ) } it should "multiply two numbers" in { assert( calculator.multiply(10, 5) === 50 ) } it should "divide two numbers" in { assert( calculator.divide(10, 5) === 2 ) } it should "Throw an exception if denominator is zero" { assertThrows[ArithmeticException](calculator.divide(10, 0)) } } 
 And here is my simple calculator:
 class Calculator { def add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b def subtract(a: Int, b: Int) = a - b def multiply(a: Int, b: Int) = a * b def divide(a: Int, b: Int) = a / b } 
 It's the last test that is failing, this was part of a rock the JVM tutorial, but instead of funspec I'm trying to learn flatspec. Why is this failing please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
I would rather use a link-as-search to be as future proof and software agnostic as possible. I also prefer to use a UID internal to the body of the text instead of using a filename as I am very new to this and still changing my titles. To create an internal link, I copy the UID number of the filename (without the title) at the top of the body of my zettel. Then in my second zettel, I open a [[]] and inside I paste the UID number of the first zettel. The [[UID]] becomes green. When I hover on it it says that the file is not found. When I click on it, a search is launched and I have my two zettels that appear in the search bar but the target zettel does not open automatically. Is it normal? Should it only open in the search bar?
I saw that a "#" was sometimes set before the UID (in the body) of the zettel of origin. Is this necessary besides to denote that it is the zettel of origin?
Thank you and sorry if it is a bit messy (or very obvious), I am totally new with markdown and all of these softwares!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been studying FP for a while now in my spare time, mostly in Scala and TypeScript. I've gotten very deep into it. I feel I have a strong understanding of all the core concepts, as well as all the most common monads and other main design patterns. In short, I feel like I've got a very solid grasp of programming in FP.
 My problem lately just comes down to putting it all together at scale. Whenever I've tried to write a full app using purely FP design principles, it feels like it becomes a mess as I layer on more and more features. Because of this, I feel my main limitation is how to use functional composition for a larger system when dealing with network requests/responses, database operations, dependency injection, loose coupling, etc. I can write an application that does all these things, I just haven't been really happy with the results.
 What I'm hoping to get is one of two things. The first would be an example codebase, something open on GitHub. Something using, maybe, http4s and cats? Something that I can look through and study how it's been architected, maybe even transcribe it (I have found that re-writing code makes it stick in my head better than just reading it).
 On the other hand, maybe there are some tutorials/courses/etc out there which cover this kind of stuff. I really do NOT want one of those "This is a functor" type FP courses, I don't need that at this point. Something that goes much deeper into full-scale application construction is what I'm after.
 Thanks in advance for any help and guidance you can provide.

 I am starting study on history and philosophy, and want to be able to easily keep track of dates, events, birth-to-death of individuals, birth-to-death of nations etc. 
 Wikipedia does it using multiple pages for different timescales
  
Timelines_of_world_history
 Timelines_of_modern_history
 Timeline_of_the_17th_century
 1630s
  
My goal is to have navigable timeline to quickly find items of relevance. Is the above Wikipedia method the best available. Is there a mode that would help manage this?
 Also I want to use something similar to time.graphics for visualisation. It's quite expensive though. 
 Do you have any ideas, on how I should visualise timelines?

 I want to really learn Emacs and have gone through the basic tutorials. I want to start adding packages but it all seems so overwhelming to me. I'd like to add a package at a time to my basically blank configuration.
 Can anyone recommend just the basic packages I should have to do C/C++ and Python until I learn how to use those? I'd like the basic IDE stuff like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, file differences and a file tree. Recommendations? What else should I have?

 I've fount solution for this issue here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/48719/keep-text-selection-after-indenting-with-evil 
 It works but I have couple of questions. 
 Whenever I use evil-mode and when I select some text and move/indent it with "<" and ">" , in mini-buffer there is message Wrong type argument: wholenump, nil Should that concern me? 
 Currently, this fix is placed outside of mine use-package config of evil-mode. Could that be the reason of the message in mini-buffer? It would be nice if I could place this fix inside of my use-package evil-mode config.
 Here is chunk of code from my init.el : LINK

In that other thread I mention that I'd like to see a Scrivener for plain text. The key with Scrivener is that it has a lot of organization tools that AFAIK no other writing app has. But maybe I'm relying too much on the editor for the organization. I do keep a Zettelkasten but I only collect literature/thought notes (as opposed to "evidence notes" or notes on primary sources). Most of the texts I write need to combine the two.
Does it make sense to try and capture all the materials needed for a document in the archive? If you keep all the text materials needed to write a document as notes in the Zettelkasten, how important are the o…]]></summary>

 A very strange situation here. When I launch the client from the terminal using emacsclient -c, the client launches with the terminal showing a message Waiting for Emacs.... However, when I use a .desktop file it fails to launch! Curiously, when I set Terminal=true in the .desktop, it works. Any idea what's going wrong? Thanks!

 I was wondering whether anyone had experimented with a custom icalendar org template. I see that there is the gnus-icalendar-insinuate-org-templates function. I also notice there is a key that is used, but I don't think changing the key to one that is linked to a custom template would work. 
 What is your setup with gnu-icalendar? 
 Best,

 As a user, I am quite thrilled about named routes, as well as another change in Servant 0.19 brought by our team at Tweag (this time driven by Andrea Condoluci): better error messages for faulty routes. Writing routes in a type-level DSL can be tricky because errors can get hairy, and you lose a lot of the benefits of interacting with GHC's type checker. Both of these changes should help make Servant APIs more manageable, and more accessible to newcomers.

 insertOrd :: (a, b) -> [(a, b)] -> [(a, b)] insertOrd x xs = x : xs insertFlipped :: (b, a) -> [(a, b)] -> [(a, b)] insertFlipped x xs = flipped x : xs where flipped (a, b) = (b, a) 
 What I want to do is to define a function insert that will run the appropriate version of insertXXX based on the type of the first argument, imagine something like the following:
 insert :: pair -> [(a, b)] -> [(a, b)] insert = case typeOf pair of (a, b) -> insertOrd (b, a) -> insertFlipped _ -> fail_during_compilation 
 Of course, that code is not valid Haskell, but I was wondering if I could achieve something like that using some type-level magic.
 Thanks in advance for any suggestion!

 (add-hook 'web-mode-hook 'something) 
 Tracking back a bit, I was wondering why .dir.locals were not being read, and it was because of the hook failure - all later hooks were being halted as a result, so it was not reading .dir.locals. I was only able to notice that by going to the *Messages* buffer.
 Is there a way to configure Emacs to throw an error when a hook fails? That would be much better for debugging and for making any errors obvious. I don't want to be lenient to hook failures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A very annoying issue with desktop-save and desktop-read that I'm encountering at the moment:
  
I'm starting Emacs in daemon-mode, and then open a client frame. I do 'desktop-read' and my saved desktop opens with the 10 or so frames I had saved.
 
When I go to one of the frames with a buffer I'm no longer interested in, and do C-x C-c, I end up not just closing that particular frame, but all 10 or so of the frames that were open.
 
The Emacs daemon is still running, and opening another client frame shows that the buffers haven't been killed, so nothing has been lost per se - it's just that the arrangement of all the frames I had is just ruined.
 
 Any idea how to stop this behaviour (i.e. being able to just kill one frame from the saved configuration)? 
 I should add that I have also been using the minimal setup for desktop.el as shown in the EmacsWiki, but I /think/ (but am not sure) that the problem is independent of this.

 I'm looking to write a function, for my role-playing games, allowing me to create random tables with elements that have weight.
 For example, consider the following list:
 1 - 20 : 2d6 kobold
 21 - 45 : 1 troll
 46 - 100 : 3d6 orcs
 Running the function I want to be able to pick 20% of the time the "2d6 kobold" etc.
 Ideally, the function would allow me to automatically execute the dice roll. I will have then, for example: 5 kobolds!
 Not being a programmer, all I can do is create a function to select an item from a "flat" list.
 Any idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am pretty new to Haskell and learning it for fun, coming from Python. I recently tried to solve a problem using memoization, and I was surprised how hard it is in Haskell. I read up on a few things, for example
 https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Fix_and_recursion
 that provides the basic concepts. Naively, I had assumed that pure functional programming language should make memoization *easier* as there are no unintended side-effects. Instead, basically every approach I found requires me rewrite the function definition itself of the function I want to memoize. 
 Am I simply missing something? Are there some techniques for memoization that don't require rewriting the function? Maybe some compiler settings?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I'm reading "Thinking functionally with Haskell" chapter 2. I have questions about Exercise D in Chapter 2.
 The first part of the question was easy to understand. It is about comparing lazy vs strict evaluation about the expression
 head (map f xs) where xs is a list of length n.
 -> With Strict evaluation the function f is applied to all elements in xs after which the first element of the list is retrieved. So function f is applied n times.
 -> With lazy evaluation the expression is reduced to
 let p = map f xs in head (p)
 which reduces to f applies to the first element in XS. i.e. f xs0 
 ​
 In the second part of the question, there is a function filter p which when applied to a list returns a list of elements that satisfies the boolean test p.
 filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
 head . filter p xs returns the first element that satisfies the condition p. 
 In the question I'm having a hard time visualizing how lazy evaluation will work. With innermost reduction, the filter is applied to each element of the list and a list with elements that satisfies p is returned and head takes the first element of the list. 
 How will lazy evaluation work here? applying p to the input list might prune away elements from the output. 
 Is it that with lazy evaluation, filter p is applied only until the first element in the list meets the criteria as opposed to eager evaluation where filter p is applied to all elements in the input list?

 (custom-autoload 'async-bytecomp-package-mode "async-bytecomp" nil)
 (autoload 'async-bytecomp-package-mode "async-bytecomp" "\
 ("Byte compile asynchronously packages installed with package.el.
 Async compilation of packages can be controlled by
 \async-bytecomp-allowed-packages'.`
 `If called interactively, enable Async-Bytecomp-Package` `mode if ARG is positive, and disable it if ARG is zero or` `negative. If called from Lisp, also enable the mode if` `ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if ARG is \`toggle';` `disable the mode otherwise.` 
 \(fn &optional ARG)" 151 152 (face default) 207 208 (face default) 266 267 (face default) 323 324 (face default) 381 382 (face default)) t nil)
 The (" starting on line 3 and the snippet
 151 152 (face default) 207 208 (face default) 266 267 (face default) 323 324 (face default) 381 382 (face default))
 break autoloads for all sorts of packages in a way that is hard to track down (paren/quote mismatch leads to invalid autoloads for rest of the file).
 The snippet does not always feature the same numbers. Example:
 34 35 (face default) 91 92 (face default) 148 149 (face default) 201 202 (face default) 260 261 (face default))
 ...any ideas on this? These snippets have appeared in a wide number of autoload files-- magit, org-roam, valign, some ivy rich packages, etc. They do not appear in the upstream git repositories.
 ​
 They also reappear on package update, breaking large swathes of functionality.

Last Week
Wrote a scientist profile using The Archive and Marked2
Created a Poetry of Zettelkasting video showing how I use The Archive and Marked2 in my writing
Studied and became more familiar with the writer tools in Marked2
Read The Secret to Superhuman Strength by Alison Bechdel, a graphic autobiography. ★★★★★
Didn't re-engage with woodworking like I said I would last week. I'm trying again this week.
This Week
Refactoring Meditations on Self-Discipline 201901021303 from 90% quotes to 90% my assimilation of the quotes meaning. This book I onboarded at the beginning of my ZK journey. So I've spent about 10 hours over the last couple of weeks on this. It is a rewarding time spent refactoring this series of 30 notes—only a few more to go. "Ferraiolo, William. Meditations on Self-Discipline and Failure: Stoic Exercise for Mental Fitness. O Books, 2017."
Reading and onboarding "Paul, Annie Murphy. The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2021."
Spring Break, so no JAMM328 assignments
Re-engage with woodworking. Maybe having a tie-in with my ZK might help motivate me. Thanks, @sfast, for the link to a beautiful ZK cabinet.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think one of the massively underrated use cases of Haskell is as a tool for discussion. For example I recently was chatting to a friend about a particular chess analysis he was experimenting with and although he is a non-programmer we were able to explore the idea very deeply through a quick 2 hour XP style discussion. He was 100% able to follow the data types and basics, but most importantly able to follow and guide the algorithms that resulted (as much as I was encoding english to haskell, he was also able to map back from haskell to his own internal model easily). 
 Haskell might be difficult to write, high learning curve etc, but its simplicity to read and follow is an underrated super feature?
 I blogged about it here (if you are interested in more detail of our XP session and some code snips etc) https://www.tomwells.org/blog/haskell_for_prototyping

 (global-set-key (kbd "M-b-b") #'bm-toggle) but that doesnt work because: "M- must prefix a single character, not b-b"
 I tried multiple combinations, like "M-b M-b" but without any success. Is it possible to do this with global-set-key or even the :bind in use-package?
 M = Meta key

Would something like this be useful to you?
 Is there already a better way to do what my implementation here is doing?
 If you think it could be useful to you, does it seem intuitive to use?
 What features do you wish it had, what could be improved?
 If you are kind enough to do a code review, have I made any obvious mistakes? (I am still new to Emacs Lisp).

 This theme looks good, but I hate the fact that's in white - burns my eyes
 ​
 I like [DT's theme](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/distro.tube ) 's theme - but how do i get his particular dark theme? Sorry if this is a very specific question...
 ​
 ​
 If not, is there any other place where i can just get the link for the theme, and apply it , like the one in the pic?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having previously worked with python, java, C and javascript I have developed some personal preferences for features/styles in programming languages that don't seem to be supported in more modern popular and low-level languages (Go and Rust).
 I'm wondering if these patterns are incorrect or if I'm attempting to use an object-orientated or functional style in a procedural language where it doesn't fit.
 The following are a few of my favourites that initially sprung to mind.
  
Chained operations on arrays/lists with functionally defined behaviour e.g. a.filter(a => a > 5).sort().slice(2).max()
 Wrapper alternatives to checking for null. e.g. extending the previous example ...2).max().else(0)
 Inline everything. e.g. if a is b then c() else d() and for 1..X as x do a += x
  
Am I a functional programmer in denial? The only thing keeping me from this conclusion is that I use a lot of oop techniques in tandem with the above.
 Or do I just want what's bad for me? In support of this is the fact that all the languages that allow these patterns are very generic and mainstream and don't have the careful direction of your Gos and rusts.

 This happens in certain code blocks - when i insert a code block NOT inside a bullet the indentation seems perfect though.

 I know there's _probably_ a really simple config i have to tweak in my config.el ( I'm using Doom Emacs ), but forgive me , I just have no clue 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR - I have ADHD...my desk is a mess, my emacs is a mess, my life is a mess. HEEEEELP!
 Let me start by apologizing for this long ass post. I'm having trouble articulating what I want. 
 I am using Doom Emacs.
 There are two things I have been trying to figure out how to do. They are probably very simple but I can't seem to word them correctly in text so I am having trouble finding solutions. 
 I have ADHD, so things become very messy very quickly. If I don't lay things out a certain way I can become distracted and/or lose interest. One way to prevent this is by adding some flair to whatever I am doing. Does anyone have an easy way to add some style to an org document? Some ideas I had was to change header colors, add images (which I have sort of figured out), and maybe add borders or something.
 Another issue caused by my constant mental blockages is organization. When I had seen projects in the Doom dashboard I thought this would work but it seems designed for coding projects. How does everyone organize their org files? I'd like to find a way to set up a notebook type thing and open a directory in a buffer to navigate between the different files. Like a table of contents for every projects, and maybe a master TOC for all of my org files.
 Again, sorry for the long winded post. I suck at Reddit, and don't expect much response cuz long posts get ignored, but figured I'd shoot my shot.

 How are you doing?
 I'm getting excited about this post because when I understood how hl-line-mode works, it opened new horizons for me in the world of Elisp.
 I hope you will feel the same way after:
  
reading this post or,
 by directly reading the source code of hl-line-mode that can be found in the file lisp/hl-line.el (only 205 LOC skipping comments and empty lines).
  
You can get emacs's source code by running the following command:
 git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git

The topic is an open source library I'm a co-maintainer of for a couple of years now. https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift
The general idea of the library may survive, but the library itself is likely about to become obsolete in 1--3 years because of technical changes. That's why I want to do something with this, anything really, before it can only go straight to the trash. (Aka the sub-conscious of the Zettelkasten through forgetting about it.)

 After exporting an archive from Simplenote (Settings → Tools → Export Notes) and installing this package, run org-import-simplenote then select the downloaded archive. Every note (that isn't trashed) will be imported as an Org heading, complete with the creation timestamp.
 The creation timestamp is used as the headline; I might add an option to use the first line of the note content instead, like how Simplenote itself displays notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I released my new emacs package zetteldesk.el and made a post here for showcasing it. The idea was rather well accepted but I got a lot of feedback, that the README was too dense in information and it was hard for a new user to try it. I have tried fixing this, by integrating gifs for demonstrations instead of the raw info (which I moved to the wiki for anyone wanting it), adding a set of default bindings in the form of a hydra and a small sample config to get you started.
 ​
 I believe some people might have been set off by those problems, so I wanted to say thank you for pointing them out. I would love to hear what you think of it now, that I have tried to make it more explanative and if it is truly easier for someone to get started with it.
 ​
 As I said in the other post, I am very new to this, so I really appreciate and listen to feedback, as I feel the idea itself is good, but some parts of the implementation may be lacking, and who better to help me than the community.
 ​
 Thank you all for helping,
 Best regards,
 Vidianos

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since in my last Scala job we agreed that functions will be separate from data, I have often felt the urge to make many (most?) of those functions into extension methods. However, I felt it would introduce a bunch of boilerplate code that is not really necessary in any way.
 Now with syntax changes in Scala 3 generally, and also with the dedicated syntax for extension methods I don't see any reason anymore to not write code this way. Feels like the best of both words.
 Can you think of any reason why that would be a bad idea. While I don't have this problem right now, I can hardly imagine reviewers being content with such code in PRs, though I can't see a reason for objections either.

I'm just trying to get "my feet wet" a bit in browsing elisp and github. I'm guessing it's a local variable, being used only right there? That's Question1.
 Question2: So also, why does my search on github not find the reference for "ctf" in org.el? On github, I've set the repository to 
  
emacs-mirror
 mirrored from git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
  
Then in the upper left search text box, I do a "search in this repository" for ctf. It only gives me two files:
 test/lisp/epg-resources/seckey.asc
 doc/misc/mh-e.texi
 Question3: Why doesn't it also list org.el? Am I misunderstanding that search function? I was looking for any other references to "ctf" in the code base. 
 So that's my final question (Question4), is how do I find all occurrences of something in a repository using github web interface?

 Today I was trying to debug Scala.js within an IDE (both IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and VSCode).
 I've read some posts/issues/jetbrains issues but all of them are older (2016-17 era), but the most they managed to get is in-browser debugging.
 As years passed, is there a way to properly debug through an IDE?
 Also afaik debugging depends on sourcemaps, so does error tracking libraries such as Sentry. Is it possible to properly error track Scala.js?

 I have a project in common lisp, and I wrote this function
 (defun imenu-literate (src-edit?) (interactive "P") (let ((imenu-generic-expression lisp-imenu-generic-expression) (imenu-create-index-function #'imenu-default-create-index-function)) (imenu-list-update-safe) (imenu-list-refresh) (call-interactively #'imenu) (when src-edit? (org-edit-special)))) 
 which is fair enough to understand and works but it sure feels like a Hack. Moreover I'd like to use this for more languages and I'd like to set the underlying mode through org mode as a pragma.
 But since this would be so convenient I wanted to ask if there is already something like this and I don't have to invent a new wheel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I realized today from reading Johannes Schmidt’s paper1 is this:
In Luhmann’s second ZK:
Luhmann had 67,000 Main Notes (aka, Permanent Notes)
And he had 15,000 Literature Notecards in his bibliography (usually with about 10-15 bullet points of thoughts and page numbers per book or article he read).
This means for each book or article he read, he only creates on average 4 to 5 main notes.
The other bullet points (like the other 10 bullet points) he would just make references to the book and page numbers.
He would go to a card about Ideology for instance and write “For more on Ideology, see Williamson p. 256” for instance.
I think there’s an assumption out there that one ought develop every bullet point literature note they take.
Any thoughts on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm new to Haskell and trying to wrap my head around it, coming from imperative languages it's so different I might as well have never coded in my life. I find the syntax... strange, to say the least.
 I'm trying to understand a solution for a function that detects if a String is a pangram (contains every letter of the alphabet), here it is :
  isPangram text = all (`elem` text) ['A'..'Z'] 
 What I don't understand are those parentheses, they don't make sense to me. 
 As far as I can tell, elem takes 2 arguments; a character then a string. So what does (elem text) even mean? It has to do something, because if I take those parentheses out, the function no longer works. Yet (elem text) doesn't actually work on its own, so what is going on here?
 Also, all takes a list of booleans right? Assuming all is supposed to be applied to a list of booleans, I would think that (elem text) ['A'..'Z'] should get reduced to a list of booleans, but actually that code also doesn't work on its own. Where is the list of booleans all is applied to coming from, then?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I encountered these two lines while reading Purcell's config. My main problem is not knowing the differences between "making packages available", "loading packages", and "activating packages".
  
 From the docs, (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) doesn't "make installed packages available when Emacs starts". So, does "installed packages" here refer to packages found in load-path? Also, what does it mean for a package to be "available"? Such that (require 'package) will work?
  
 Then, (package-initialize) will "load Emacs Lisp packages, and activate them". So what do "loading" and "activating" here mean? Does "loading" here mean the same thing as (load FILE)? Then "activating" means (provide FEATURE)?
  
 I've tried reading Elisp Packaging Section but still couldn't understand

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So years ago I did a project with Scala and really liked it, and now that I'm very into functional programming these days I've picked it up again through a course I'm taking on Akka. I've got a lot more experience with Java & Kotlin than Scala, fyi.
 Anyway, while doing this Akka course I just decided to create a nice simple utility function within an object to abstract away all the boilerplate setup/teardown for actor systems during the course:
 package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.utils // BONUS: Not my main question, but why do we declare packages twice? import akka.actor.ActorSystem import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global object ActorSystemHandler { def useSimpleSystem(name: String, useSystem: ActorSystem => Unit): Unit = { val system = ActorSystem(name) useSystem(system) system.terminate() .map(_ => println("ActorSystem terminated")) } } 
 My issue is when i try to use this into one of my lesson objects, like so:
 package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.part2actors import io.me.akka.utils.ActorSystemHandler // This is the line for #2 import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorRef, Props} object ChangingActorBehavior extends App { ActorSystemHandler.useSimpleSystem("systemName", system => { // Do stuff with the system }) } 
 There are two main issues that occur:
  
When I type the name ActorSystemHandler, I get the option to auto-import it like usual in IntelliJ. However, when I actually click that option, nothing happens. The IntelliJ auto-import fails to do anything.
 I go ahead and manually add the import statement, as can be seen above. However, "io.me.akka" part of the import is shaded in that grayish color that IntelliJ uses to indicate something is not necessary.
  
I'm hoping someone can clarify the above points for me. Manually adding the import results in code that will compile/run, but I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Thanks.

 Then I want to extract client using:  UsersRoutes { usersId = fromServant @_ @(AsClientT ClientM) -> UserIdRoutes {..}, ..} = genericClient @_ @ClientM 
 GHC politely tells me that fromServant cannot be applied to the pattern, because type mismatches.
 How can I distribute captured id to UserIdRoutes in convenient way when I want to extract client from UsersRoutes using pattern matching?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a package which automatically and intelligently rewrites variable-name to variableName or variable_name depending on the current major language mode? It should be intelligent enough to account for cases where you're typing within the bounds of string quotes. The more I think about this problem the more difficult I think it would be to write such a package --- perhaps none exists.
 As an example, let's suppose we're writing Python (with | as the cursor):
 Basic:
  
variable-name|
 variable-name |
 variable_name | (conversion performed)
  
In quotes:
  
variable_name 'foo-bar|
 variable_name 'foo-bar |
 variable_name 'foo-bar | (no conversion as the user is typing within quotes)
  
In f-string:
  
variable_name f'foo {bar-baz|
 variable_name f'foo {bar-baz |
 variable_name f'foo {bar_baz | (conversion performed)

 Is it possible to do it in the regular org-todo-list view?

One of the most basic presuppositions of communication is that the partners can mutually surprise each other. Only in the way can information be produced in the respective other.
If...we seek communication with the second mind, we must seek internal possibilities for linkings which result in the unexpected (i.e. information).


In digging through the forums, it seems that some believe that Luhmann (and/or the community) overstates the importance of surprise in a Zettelkasten. If you are of this belief, can you enlighten me as to why you make this claim?]]></summary>

 I never use those keys. I would like to define at least one of them with a whole lot of bindings for entering unicode symbols (for instance, right-alt-A as the "alpha" symbol). I assume I'd want to set them up to act as "super" or "hyper" in emacs lingo.
 This is under windows, but I'm also interested in doing the same thing when I'm running emacs on an AWS linux box (via XMinG under windows).

 I was going to post there, but I think this is more of a general how to question.
 I have a shell script that I've been using as a template for my blog posts. I think, I could rework it to end up as an org file. But I recently watched a System Crafters video on org roam which talks about org-capture-template particularly the template in Org files bit
 if anyone cares about the script here's the gist
 is there a way to make an org template for blog posts that would work like org-capture but store the file in path/to/jekyll/_posts
 TL;DR is there a way to make a chord to open an org template for blog posts?

 At the same time, I'm developing my note taking workflow using Org mode and Org Roam.
 What's the best way to sync the two? I don't have a preference for which Android app to use, as long as it allows me to take notes directly on the PDF in a way that can then easily be exported and integrated with the rest of my notes in Emacs.
 I don't mind writing a little conversion script if necessary, e.g. to automatically insert some links to my org-roam nodes where possible.

I’m a heavy user of criterion.rs as well as one of its maintainers, and three particular pain points have been sticking out like a sore thumb to me.

 The package works in a manner similar to the direnv program (and is mostly compatible with it). Moreover, it sets the environment variables buffer-locally, so once things are configured everything runs on autopilot and you don't need to manually switch between different projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to move away from spacemacs to my own config. But I want to have the packages that I have set up. I would like to move away from spacemacs for the sake of flexibility and control. Spacemacs is too late for some of the important items like native comp and their develop branch sometimes has bugs.
 I would like to minimize the changes in my workflow, if I cant keep them the same(keybindings et. al.). Replicating the same environment is proving to be cumbersome due to :
 - Spacemacs setup has too many packages, I am not even 1/4th of the way through and already the literate config is a couple of thousands of lines long.
 - I am used to the keybindings of spacemacs and replicating them is taking too much time. I have already built all the muscle memory and don't want a different set of keys.
 - Going through all the documentation of the packages to get the exact setup as I had in spacemacs is very tricky. Sometimes spacemacs has some clever ways of handling things, which needs me to look into spacemacs code.
 - Going over spacemacs code is complex. I am now left with the feeling that I am replicating spacemacs code in my config.
 Has anyone felt the same? how have you dealt with this?

 I have an issue in the new Scala3 docs. Special characters in entities are not escaped when the scala doc is generated, which leads to some issue when hosting the scaladoc on some website like Github Pages. An example would be a class named "~" which generate a file called "~.html" which is not found by Github Pages
 However in previous Scala2 scaladoc the character was escaped with something like "$tilde.html"
 Any idea if it is possible to get this behavior in scala3 ? 
 Here are a working and a flawed example :

Also, I used to use makefiles, but I read that since clangd uses something called compile_commands.json and CMake can produce them, the latter would be a better option... the problem is that I don't know how this whole interaction works and I can't find a clear explanation about this on the internet. Lastly, is there a way to use only makefiles instead of CMake, or is it either impossible or impractical?

Indentation: It is the tabulator key after all
 Completion: As in TAB-completion in the terminal
 folding: like in orgmode, but most code that has blocks can be folded
  
I don't have a good solution for all of them at once. ideally it would support different packages for Indentation/compilation/folding.

 When creating a new internal link, org allows you to specify the text for that link. Is there a way to dynamically change that linking text based on the headline? If I change the text of Headline 1

The next release of Emacs, Emacs 29, will come with built-in support for pixel-based scrolling.
 You can enable it using pixel-scroll-precision-mode. 
  
I hadn't heard of this. Has anyone used this? Are there any performance issues? In my 5-minute testing I haven't noticed any.
 EDIT: According to Emacs' etc/NEWS, this is what the new mode actually improves in comparison to pixel-scroll-mode:
  ** New minor mode 'pixel-scroll-precision-mode'. When enabled, and if your mouse supports it, you can scroll the display up or down at pixel resolution, according to what your mouse wheel reports. Unlike 'pixel-scroll-mode', this mode scrolls the display pixel-by-pixel, as opposed to only animating line-by-line scrolls.

Watch this at your own risk. I can't be responsible for damages to your DNA? You might get something out of this video that will help your writing.
This combo of the software The Archive and Marked2 are the absolute best writing software combo ever!
A part of the writing process that this video doesn't show is the gathering and referencing of the entire ZK when making the zettel that makes up this essay. I habitually run The Archive in two-window mode and keep the right window focused on my work and the left window I use to search my ZK, view PDFs or live preview with Marked2.

Best view in full screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, how are u doing?
 So... I have a doubt related to the usage of for comprehension...
 Lets imagine that I have an User type that is the product of UserId, UserName and UserEmail and each of them contains its own validations, right?
 So lets imagine that my value called UserName looks like this:
 ```scala final case class ValidationError(message: String)
 final case class UserName private(name: String)
 type UserNameFactoryResult = Either[ValidationError, UserName]
 object UserName { def fromString(rawName: String): UserNameFactoryResult = ... // some validation blabla } ```
 Now I am trying to think about the factory for the User entity inside of my object companion.
 I want to use somekind of for-comprehension but I dont have any idea on how to mix the for-comprehension with my either results
 ```scala case class User(id: UserId, name: UserName, email: UserEmail)
 type UserFactoryResult = Either[List[ValidationError], User]
 object User { def createFromStrings(rawId: String, rawName: String, rawEmail: String): UserFactoryResult = { val eitherUser = for { id <- UserId.fromString(rawId) // this can be Left or Right name <- UserName.fromString(rawName) // this can be Left or Right email <- UserEmail.fromString(rawEmail) // this can be Left or Right } yield new Right(User(id, name, email)) } } ```
 well well... what I need to do with this code is to find a way to CORRECTLY returns EITHER a List with each error that happened in those type values EITHER my valid User with its correct values.
 what should I do? what is the cleanest way of doing this with pure scala 3? can I avoid nesting pattern match inside this for-comprehension? how to go on with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys! I am a front-end web developer, tired of JS-TS.
 First of all, I am not familiar with Scala and its ecosystem, so, sorry about that.
 I own a startup which is close to make a deal with an organization for a serious project.
 I always search for viable JS alternatives and really like Scala as a language (even though I have no experience with it).
 For the last 2 days I am researching on how to embrace Scala-js. I managed to gather some information. 
 Concern no 1: interop with the JS ecosystem. Solution: scalably-typed
 Concern no 2: react bindings. Solution: Slinky
 Concern no 3: bundler. Solution: Not so sure, but I've found scalajs-bundler which works with webpack, but I am unsure about the integration with Concern no 4 bellow.
 Concern no 4: Monorepo setup-build system. 
 If anyone is familiar with JS ecosystem, there is the nx.dev monorepo managing tool which has the features I need for this project, which will be structured with a feature based folder structure.
 What I need:
  
apps folder containing 3 applications which will share many libraries-modules from the libs folder mention bellow 
  libs folder which will contain feature based modules, for reuse across the 3 apps
  
Something like this:
 apps/
 ├─ app-1/
 ├─ app-2/
 ├─ app-3/
 libs/
 ├─ feature-1/
 ├─ feature-3/
 ├─ feature-4/
 ├─ feature-2/
 ​
 How can I achieve this? Anyone with experience with something similar?
 As a reminder, those 3 apps and libs will target JS, and will need a bundler.
 Is it possible to only build the affected apps when changing some feature on libs folder?
 Even if it is possible, how maintainable will it be?
 Thank you for your answers!

 Enrique here! The consult-project-extra package got recently accepted into MELPA. Nevertheless, expect to also find the package in GNU ELPA in the future, since it only requires packages either built into Emacs or on GNU ELPA (as is consult).
 Please, try the MELPA installation process, and test the functions out. I really appreciate any comments.
 Best,

 ​
 Motivation:
 I found the exwm built-in functionality for moving windows between workspaces pretty buggy. If I remember correctly, my major issue was that the built-in functionality only worked for windows displaying exwm buffers but I wanted all windows to be treated equally. I also threw in a completing-read interface that I though I would use but haven't found much use for it. Instead I find the functionality to move windows to a specific workspace by number far more useful. 
 ​
 Anyways, feedback welcome. Happy to post to melpa if people find it useful.

 I found emacs-dashboard (dashboard.el) to be a bit to involved for my liking. I wanted a much more minmimalistic splash screen that achived the following goals:
  
Centered text (any arbitrary ascii banner) regardless of the current window size. 
 Used just a single buffer rather than requiring a bunch of duplicate buffers to achive requirement #1. 
 No flashy buttons or other things that I would never bother to click anyways. 
  
​
 Its probably not everyone's taste but it does what I need it to. Perhaps others will find it useful. If people want I can put on melpa. 
 Feedback welcome.

 This is just a really minimalistic (same theme as dired-registers) implementation of a copy-paste interface like Ranger or Ranger.el (just much more minimal).

 ​
 https://github.com/jsilve24/dired-registers
 ​
 Motivation:
 I like emacs bookmarks but I rarely want to create something so permanent to just hold my place when moving between directories (e.g., when copying and pasting files between directories; see dired-copy-paste for more on copying and pasting in dired). This package lower the barrier to keeping your place by implementing registers storing a directory and making it easy to jump back later. Think of these registers like temporary bookmarks that don't persist between sessions (just like evil registers).

I discovered that lengthening the heading sufficiently (just adding more text) and rebuilding the agenda makes the asterisks white. Removing the extra text and rebuilding again greys them out again.
 I noticed this happening a couple of days ago. What is going? Is this meant to happen, and if not, what can I do about it?

 Would anyone have some recommendation for learning how to programmatically manipulate org-mode with elisp? 
 I don't have much elisp knowledge but all the other 3rd party libraries I have found are read-only and could not find anything that allow manipulation of the file itself. 
 I have digged into the source of org-element api but I am left rather confused than anything. 
 I am trying to build an integration with gitlab and orgmode (full project description here) and while I wanted to go with either python or go, I haven't found an easy way to modify org files with any of these libraries... 
 So I am trying to go with elisp, which would probably be the most native way to do it, I am just not sure where to start...
 any direction is welcome!

"Folgezettel is More than Mechanism"
This article intends to:
Show that the current state of the FZ debate is one mired in a mechanistic reading of folgezettel
Add to the discussion the often overlooked experiential aspects of employing folgezettel
Show how the practice of folgezettel positively influences the note making process
Diversify and broaden the discussion in an effort to show that zettelkasten techniques are more compliments than competitors
From the article:

  
"A mechanistic view is one that privileges the mechanics of a process over the experiential. It ignores the emotional. It tries to establish cohesion often through reductive arguments, determining value (more or less of it) by how parts function together as a system divorced from the subjective experience of the user. As it stands, the folgezettel debate is mired in this mechanistic systems thinking...."]]></summary>

I use pdf-tools which provides pdf-misc-print-document which I can use to print with lp by setting pdf-misc-print-program-executable and pdf-misc-print-program-args. However, I am looking for "Print Dialog" like package where I can select the (network) printer, the pages, the orientation and the double-sided vs not, etc... 
 I can write a lisp function to query for these, but I am wondering if there are better solutions out there.

 I have switched to lsp-pyright and everything is fine except Python documentation functionalities. I wondered if anyone has the same problem as me and I hope that someone can give me some pointers on how to fix this.
 The problem I have is that lsp-doc-show and company-show-doc-buffer return incomplete results for many builtins and many numpy functions. Envoking these commands on list for example returns
 class list() 
 and nothing more.
 I have tried quite a lot and I am pretty confident that it has to do with LSP itself or my LSP setup because anaconda-mode-show-doc yields
 builtins list() list(iterable: Iterable[_T]) Built-in mutable sequence. If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list. The argument must be an iterable if specified. 
 which is what I want from LSP.
 Any ideas?

 The algorithm works, but its runtime scales with the bounds of the matrix, so it takes a prohibitively long time with bounds higher than 1000 or so. I don't understand why though, since I can tell by the trace that it only calculates the required elements. My first thought is that it has to preallocate the array, but I tried it with a Data.Map as well for the same result.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using Haskell has made me think about imperative languages differently. An interesting thing to think about is that the “async/await” patterns of these languages mirror monad patterns in Haskell with do-notation. The “await” keyword with “var x = await …” is just like “x <- …” in Haskell. And Future is really just a monadic type! Perhaps one day we’ll see an imperative language implement true monads and do asynchrony in terms of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am experimenting with Doom Emacs but it feel like performance is at least as bad as it was with my hand-rolled config. I am running 28.0.91 with native comp on Mojave.
 The stated startup time on the splash screen is normally 2-3 seconds: "Doom loaded 208 packages across 34 modules in 2.06 seconds". Restoring my previous workspace with 20-30 buffers takes 7-8 seconds. Opening a file in a project takes 1-2 seconds. At first I thought it was due to LSP mode, but it's still slow even with it disabled.
 I have followed some of the recommendations in Doom's README "why is Doom slow?", but my situation seems a bit more pathological than what those try to address. 
 I tried profiling opening a single line file (took a second or two) and the CPU profile says that it spent 28% of its time in automatic GC and 51% of its time in vertico--advice. I'm assuming that was the file selection popup, so it appears that Emacs is really just spending all its time waiting for something. I'd be grateful for advice how to debug further.

 In Org-mode, dragging the current paragraph (or subtree, or list item) up and down is easy with M-up and M-down.
 I'm an Evil user, so for swapping two regions, there's evil-exchange.
 Is there a package that would allow me to drag the current region up or down? Or perhaps right or left, along the same line? Or does anyone have any pointers on how to best write something that achieves this?

Launching a new window of org-capture from i3wm (triggered by a keystroke) works, but the window closes unexpectedly after some 10-50 seconds, often before I finish writing a note in the template and the work is lost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! I'm currently implementing a source code formatter using prettyprinter and ran into a situation that I can't get over.
 The assembly of the Doc is performed in the context of a state Monad, as I need to keep track of some state as I go on:
  type StateDoc = State MyState (Doc ()) 
 This works fine, I have individual functions that assemble different parts of the document:
  fortmatPartA :: DataA -> StateDoc fortmatPartB :: DataB -> StateDoc fortmatPartC :: DataC -> StateDoc  It the end when I put the document together, parts A, B and C are to be arranged on top of each other vertically:
 vsep <$> sequence [formatPartA dataA, formatPartB dataB, formatPartC dataC]
 Now the problem that I'm having is that formatPartB and formatPartC can return an emptyDoc, which can result in something like [PartADoc, emptyDoc, PartBDoc]. This is a problem because emptyDocs have a height of 1 and will introduce an unwanted newline in the final document. I would like to completely ignore the part of the document if it returns emptyDoc.
 Does someone have an idea of how I can achieve this?
 I thought about not using emptyDoc at all, but Maybe instead:
 formatPartB :: DataB -> State MyState (Maybe (Doc ()))
 but how could I implement the "excluding" logic that ignores the Nothings? Is there something like a mapMaybe or catMaybe for Monads? Maybe I'm missing something obvious.
 Thanks a lot for your help and happy haskelling :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am working on a software project which I am organizing my tasks in a hierarchical structure where a top level heading is a general feature and the sub headings are tasks that need to be done concerning that feature.
 This is very simple so far, what I would like to add now is a milestone tag so I can associate some features with a specific version, this is a very common approach in software development as far as I know. The problem is that when I write a tag containing dots, org-mode considers the dots as tag separators, so I cannot write a tag as the following :v1.0: because it would be replaced with :v1:0:.
 If anyone has any workaround for this let me know. Or if you have any other suggestions I would like to give them a try, I myself thought about some alternatives but I would first want to know if I can do it the way I want.

 I present to you my small configuration for Corfu, Kind-icon, and Corfu-doc, which greatly complement the packages in that previous post by enhancing the built-in completion-at-point.
 Sometime in the near future, I'll be trying to show my (messy) way of utilizing the cape package's completion-at-point backends.

But I'm working through the book at https://book.purescript.org/ and am wondering why the code and tests all produce a bunch of warnings?
 For example, one warning I see for the Chapter 2 code is:
  
No type declaration was provided for the top-level declaration of ns
  
I'm working in VSCode and have v0.14.7 of purs (and generally the latest versions of everything as far as I know). Maybe the book would prefer me to use an older version of the compiler?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an intermediate level knowledge of bash scripting and use of the linux command line.I know given enough time i could eventually become a power user but my dilemma is this: im also falling deeper in love with emacs. The more i read about it the more i get the feeling that it would be much more time-efficient to just master emacs and forego going deeper down the rabbit holes of bash shell scripting and the various Gnu utilities and .etc. It seems to me that with emacs I pretty much get a entire environment in which all packages,commands,config files and etc are all written in one language(e lisp). So that being said, can I just go "all in" on learning emacs and e lisp and just more or less ignore bash scripting and learning more about the various linux terminal commands?

Similarly if I open emacs, check the variable, (again,habits` is present in the list) and then open the agenda the graphs display, but if I don't check the variable they don't.

EDIT: Answered by /u/yyoncho: "You can sort by downloads on melpa.org". So here's an example of how I'm using it. As an emacs newbie, I'm interested in installing some package, let's say ido mode, but I'm also interested in the dozen or so related packages (containing "ido-"). But it's hard to get a sense of their popularity, age, etc. 
 So I downloaded the list of all packages from melpa.org, sorted by download count, and made it into a tab-delimited file: Here's the gist link to my text file.. Then I grep that to get only the "ido-" packages:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given this structure (Example 1), if point is anywhere in the line Proj1 (Level 1) and I hit C-S-RET, it will create a new "Level 1" TODO heading just before Proj2 (Level 1)
  
Example 1
 * Proj1 (Level 1) <-- IF POINT IS ANYWHERE HERE * Proj1 H1 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 Note (Level 3) blah blah * Another Note (Level 4) blah blah * Proj2 (Level 1) <-- C-S-RET INSERTS "* TODO" JUST BEFORE HERE AT LEVEL 1 * Proj2 H1 (Level 2) 
 
 But if they are folded and point is after ellipses:
  
Example 2
 * PROJ1...x <-- point at space marked x * Proj2... 
 
 When I hit C-S-RET I get this:
  
Example 3 
 * PROJ1... * TODO * Proj2... 
 
 That TODO has two invisible parents, which obscures it's context, which is shown unfolded here:
  
Example 4 
 * Proj1 (Level 1) * Proj1 H1 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 Note (Level 3) blah blah * Another Note (Level 4) blah blah * TODO (Level 4) <-- TODO ADDED HERE * Proj2 (Level 1) 
 
 Why does C-S-RET add a TODO exactly 3 levels deeper in this case? Why not any of the following alternatives: 
  
At level 1 (same as not folded)
 At level 2 (immediate child)
 At level 5 (depth first traversal of tree)
  
What is "magical" about 3 levels deeper? What are some ways for a typical beginner to deal with this? Maybe "never use C-S-RET after ellipses"? I certainly don't want to memorize that rule. Or is there some control variable?
 I think that a sane default would be one of the following:
  
At level 1 (same as not folded)
 At level 2 (immediate child)
  
Any insight would be appreciated, thanks!

Last Week
Impermanence is all around me. Everything I see is a temporary arrangement of atoms soon dispersed and reassembled into new arrangements. My attention is also always temporary. Attention flitters from one object to another in a time frame that speeds up and slows just a little from the moment of awakening to after fully sleeping. Even then, dreams grab my attention.
I successfully integrated The Archive/Marked2/Zotero/Pandoc toolchain into my writing environment.

 Here's what I've done so far to troubleshoot. If I manually look for the messages in a terminal by going into my mu maildir, I can see the archived messages. Additionally if I run `mu find some-message` I can see emails in the Archive directory. If I send my self a new email and then archive it, I can see it in emacs.

 Hello fellow emacsians. I am in the very happy position to announce to you, my first ever contribution to emacs (besides helping people with emacs here and in other forums), in the form of a new package for emacs called zetteldesk.el. It is by no means done, I have things I want to add, and I am certain its also not perfect, but its usable, and to an extent polished so I thought I would release it. I am just an engineer who loves to take his notes with org-roam, so forgive me if some code isn't written in the best version.
 ​
 The name zetteldesk derives from a mix of the words zettelkasten and desktop. I shortened it because zettelkasten-desktop was too large. zetteldesk.el is a tool I made, built primarily on top of org-roam - b…]]></summary>

 Trying to find the "best" ide and corresponding plugins for each programming language was just annoying to me. For eg. IntelliJ IDEA is great for Rust, but doesn't have an easy C++ support. 
 Thus my decision to switch to something like emacs or vim, which would have all-round support. 
 I completed the tutorial and immediately felt how convenient it would be to navigate around without having to take your hands off the keyboard. 
 I want to now continue to set up Emacs so that I can conveniently use it for the above needs. I'm setting it up in Manjaro Linux. 
 Do you all have any tips?

Well more and more I find myself knowing-but-not-quite some fact or info, or knowing that I know it, but not the full details that I knew at one point, or references or sources for looking it up.
So I decided to take the plunge and implement a zettelkasten system for myself. But as I investigated it I became intrigued by the simple yet powerful idea of notes and links, and decided to try to distill (my interpretation of) its essence into a new app. Yes, the cliche of the software dev who discovers zettelkasten and makes an app. However, I think mine has some advantages. For one thing I'm intentionally keeping it quite spartan–no endless customizability…]]></summary>

I might be going about this the absolute wrong way but I've never used a language like this before and I'm getting very lost. 
 Assignment:
 Write a Haskell program that generates the list of all the subsets of the set [1..n] that have as many elements as their complements.
 For the set [1,2,3,4] the output should look like this:
 [([1,2],[3,4]),
 ([1,3],[2,4]),
 ([1,4],[2,3]),
 ....] 
 I'm currently creating a list from 1-n where n is 6.
 I'm retrieving all of the subsequences of that list.
 let n = 6 let set = [1..n] let ordered = sortWith length $ subsequences set 
 I don't understand how to only get the list of the length of 3 out of this list of lists. What would be the best way to get the list of that length? Thank you for any input! I believe I can figure out the compliment on my own. I just don't know how to get the certain lists I need.

 Im a converting a Try to Either but IDK how to pass my own Type Alias so I can compile.
 Example:
 ```scala
 type UserIdFactoryResult = Either[ValidationError, UserId]
 object UserId { private def apply(id: String): UserId = new UserId(id) ... def fromString(rawId: String): UserIdFactoryResult = { ... case Some(rawId) => { // I need to return UserIdFactoryResult here Try(UUID.fromString(rawId)) .transform( success => Success(Right(this.apply(success.toString))), error => Success(Left(error)) ).get .... } } } ```
 But the problem is that this transformation returns an Either[Throwable, UserId] instead of UserIdFactoryResult...
 What should I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose I start with this, with point on letter J:
  
Example 1
 * PROJECTS... * Inbox... 
 
 I want this
  
EXAMPLE 2 [EDIT: Actually, this is impossible with org-indent-mode on.]
 * PROJECTS... x <--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 What's the standard way and/or the most efficient way to get there? Or alternatively, achieve this:
  
Example 3
 * PROJECTS... * x <--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 I know that if I start with Example 1 and I press C-S-RET, I'll get this:
  
Example 4
 * PROJECTS... * TODO x <--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 That's good enough for TODO's, but I'd like to do something similar for the other cases. But it's odd that it leaves a space there (why does it do that?). I'd rather it not, but I'll accept this standard behavior, for now, if that's just the way it works out-of-the-box. (I know I can change emacs to do whatever I want though.) Also, the C-S-RET behaves a little different if the point starts at the end of * Projects...x at space marked x. In that case, it creates something like this:
  
Example 5
 * PROJECTS... * TODO x <--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 In Example 5, it creates a new TODO item under the last child entry of * PROJECTS, but leaving * PROJECTS otherwise folded. Isn't it a little odd to have an intermediate parent invisible? 
 Finally, does that last point position (marked x here:* Projects...x) have special meaning/purpose? Is there a name for that position?
 EDIT: I think some of my questions about the functionality of ellipses and spaces is probably related to this timely post: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t1r2wq/have_you_ever_wondered_how_orgmode_toggles_the/. Which, from a newbie perspective, is probably summed up as "Because reasons."

 Anyway, I installed Scalaz and now I've got a list to concatenate into a single value. Sounds easy enough, let's just use a Monoid.
 Based on fp-ts, I was expecting the append() function of the Monoid to have a signature like this:
 override def append(f1: String, f2: String): String 
 When, as you already know, it actually has a signature like this:
 override def append(f1: String, f2: => String): String 
 I'm not even sure what the type of the second argument is supposed to be, let alone how to use this to concatenate my list into a single value.
 Help would be appreciated. Thanks.

I just upgraded to The Archive 1.7.6 (202) and noticed that we can now "drag and drop" images into a zettle.  The image will automatically be copied to the media sub-folder within your ZK folder, the reference will be inserted into your zettel, and the image will appear - presto!
That is so much easier than copying the image to your media file and then typing the reference in your zettel.

I'd be interested to know if there are other interested in data visualisation out of scala code... It's young, and follows a different paradigm to some of the Prior Art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've been using org-mode for writing articles for a while. And I recently tried RMarkdown. I am trying to decide which one to use in the future. 
 I really enjoy org-mode. The only problem for me is that since I do not do programming, I do not know any computer language. I have to copy and paste settings by other people for different purposes, such as spelling check, formatting, preview, etc. RMarkdown in RStudio sets up things for me and I can download some packages by others without any specific setup. 
 I also feel that I do not fully use amazing functions of org-mode. For example, while I really like the to-do list and agenda, I do not know how to seamlessly synchronize my calendar (Mac OS) and my org-mode agenda. Many of my meetings are scheduled by others sending me .ics files. I can just go to my calendar and click "accept" or "decline". Is there a way to automatically make the item appear in my org-mode agenda when I add items on my apple calendar? 
 Anyway, maybe too much information here. Just curious to see others' experience of using org-mode for academic writing.

 xwidget seems to disapear (but its only hidden) and when its hidden it always shows another buffer instead. How can I configure this to actually quit the buffer and delete the window?
 This is my function for splitting and showing the browser on the right.
 (defun mk/browser-split-window (url &optional new-window) "Create a new browser window to the right of the current one." (interactive) (let* ((ignore-window-parameters t) (dedicated-p (window-dedicated-p))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-horizontally) (other-window 1) (xwidget-webkit-browse-url url))) 
 Looks nice - now lets close it using \"q\"
 Hmm not really what I wanted.
 My complete config can be found here: https://github.com/konrad1977/emacs
 And as a bonus I have another question:
 How do I setup emacs to always set focus to (other-window 1) when a new window is created?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was playing around with diff-buffers and ediff-buffers. I had no idea what I was doing, and I ended up with my primary notes.org file containing highlighted sections, saved to disk. I didn't know how to get rid of this formatting, so I restored it from the backup notes.org~, as I had only made a minor change (thank goodness). Here's the two files, the original (restored), and the ediff highlighted file:
 https://i.imgur.com/K7340jK.png
 Now my questions are as follows:
  
I thought org files were visible text only files, editable in any other text editor. But it's clearly saving the highlight features with the text. How is it doing that? What is the format?
 
If I end up with something like this on the right again, how can I strip all the highlight formatting, so I get back to what's shown on the left?

 YES!!! me either!
 Let's get into it ;)
 Table of content:
  
org-mode visibility of headings
 text properties
 Why are we talking about text properties if the mechanism of outline-mode uses overlays?
 overlays, invisible overlay property, buffer-invisibility-spec 
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to t
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to nil
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to ((foo) t)
 
 ellipsis and buffer-invisibility-spec equal to ((foo . t) t) 
 default ellipsis ...
 custom ellipsis modifying the display table
 
  
org-mode visibility of headings
 org-mode is built on top of outline-mode that is responsible of the visibility changes of the headings.

It organizes the APIs into categories nicely, so I can quickly find out the exact APIs that I want, and then I look up them inside Emacs using Help, Info, etc.
 But the page was gone last year (I can't remember the exact date), the content was gone, although the URL was still reachable. What a pity!
 Do you know why it was gone? I didn't find an alternative to it after that. If you know the maintainer or maintainers, would you like to tell him/her/them about the issue? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the moment, GHC has some machinery for tracking (annotating and inferring) the roles of parameters to type constructors. Roles and their machinery do not appear to be first class, in that it is not possible to discuss the roles of parameters to higher kinded type variables. This is a bit annoying, because in the absence of the ability to discuss such things one has to explicitly carry around coercion dictionary baggage.
 The "role" of a parameter roughly encodes the sort of "equality functor" the type-level function is. Specifically, the role of some type constructor's parameter determines what kind of equivalence it needs as input in order to produce a representational equivalence as output. If it requires _, the parameter has a _:
  
definitional equality, nominal role
 representational equivalence, representational role
 codiscrete equivalence (any two things are equal), phantom role
  
So it seems to me that properly speaking, the role actually belongs to the -> in the kind of the type constructor in question. Namely we have three different variations:
  
haskell type Nominal :: Type -{NOM}-> Type data Nominal x where Nominal :: Nominal Int 
 haskell type Representational :: Type -{REP}-> Type data Representation x = Representational x 
 haskell type Phantom :: Type -{FAN}-> Type data Phantom x = Phantom 
  
Similar systems of inference, notation, "subtyping" etc. could be devised to the ones for linear function arrows (which occur at the type level), so that working with these things is not very painful. It might also make sense to think of "role polymorphism", although I personally haven't given this much thought.
 What do you folks think? Am I missing something obvious?
 EDIT: The Reddit editor ate half my post and I had to rewrite it, apologies to anyone who saw the truncated version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to create a PoC literately programmed python project and cannot for the life of me figure out how to have LSP-based completion inside noweb blocks. There is a sort of pseudocode block with a few references to chunks that come later, and I would like to have completion while writing these chunks somehow. Editing the :noweb yes chunk of code using C-c ' does not seem to expand the noweb references at all, which is not ideal. The blocks themselves also don't have completion when I tangle the :noweb yes block to a file and use lsp-org.
 Both of those solutions feel like they should work, so it is possible I've run into a bug because I'm running gccemacs. Is this the case? Is it normal for noweb and lsp-based completion for python to just work inside of your org file?
 I'm very much hoping I'm just doing something wrong, as the potential of this style when writing code for high-turnover teams with mixed capabilities seems very high to me. I'm afraid it won't be possible to instigate such a culture change without code completion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej Hej,
 This [https://gitlab.com/OlMon/consult-flyspell] is a small package to collect all misspelled words in a buffer and display it with consult.
 This package was born because I wanted to have a nice display of all my mistakes. I know kinda sadistic...
 I tried the great package flycheck-aspell/flymake-aspell [https://github.com/leotaku/flycheck-aspell]. It has almost everything I need, but for my 11 year old notebook it was a little bit to much. Additionally I was not sure if I would only use aspell and not switch to hunspell at some day.
 In the consult issue "command wishlist" it is stated:
 "consult-flyspell, provided by see https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct, [...]"
 That is correct, flyspell-correct displays the correction in the minibuffer, consult-flyspell displays the misspelled words in the minibuffer.
 I actually use both packages and set the variable consult-flyspell-correct-function to flyspell-correct-at-point to jump to a word and correct it.
 Maybe it helps someone, or maybe I did something that already existed, then please let me know.
 Cheers,
 OlMon

 Is there a function, macro, or some other pattern to keep in mind to copy the behavior with several built-in Emacs functions? Or is it some built-in magic that I'm not going to really be privvy to?

The only difference is that it is not limited to GitHub Actions configurations, but can generate all kinds of text files. The key feature is that the plugin is able to verify that the generated configs are up-to-date in CI (just like sbt-github-actions).
 Since I've noticed how incredibly useful this plugin has become for me, I thought I'd share it here to show it to a wider audience (:
 I tend to use it for deployment configs, generating dev environment Dockerfiles and unopinionated GitHub Actions configs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At some point in I think 2021, read-extended-command-predicate was added, which lets you filter what M-x shows you. One of the intended use cases is to prevent commands for one major mode from showing up when working in another major mode. It's nil by default, but you can (setq read-extended-command-predicate 'command-completion-default-include-p)... except for the fact that basically no package I can find actually uses this, either by using
 (defun foo () (declare (modes . (lisp-mode))) (interactive) (message "I only show up in some-mode")) 
 or by (put 'foo 'command-modes '(lisp-mode)). I'd like to go through all the commands whose names start with (say) python- and mark them as being python-mode commands. What's the easiest way to do that?
 PS, is there any downside to package authors doing this? The declare variation warns on older versions of emacs, but the put variation should work no matter what. I'm really surprised this has almost no adoption/conversation that I could find. Out of all the packages I have cloned locally, only transient uses it, and only vertico and other packages by the same author use the related completion-predicate property.

 This will open a new window where my autocomplete package, in this case yassnippet, can autocomplete base on key words. For example, while inside the editting source code mode, I can type "eq" and TAB and automatically a LaTex snippet for equation is inserted. 
 For my case, sometimes I need to use an export block, so #+begin_export latex and #+end_export. How can I autocomplete in this case? Obviously, org-edit-src-code does not work because it is not an "src" block but an "export" block. 
 Any input is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of the box, calling org-store-link when point is on a headline displayed on an agenda view behaves as you would expect: it does much what it would have done had you called org-store-link from an org-mode buffer visiting the relevant file with point on the same headline. But if you set org-agenda-sticky to t , calling org-store-link from an agenda buffer gives the following error:
 user-error: No method for storing a link from this buffer 
 After digging around a bit I think I found the culprit: for the agenda relevant behavior of org-store-link to be activated, you need to be in a buffer with the name specified in org-agenda-buffer-name. On my end, org-agenda-buffer-name is set to *Org Agenda*, but when org-agenda-sticky is set to t, agenda buffers have a different name of the form *Org Agenda(VIEW)*, where VIEW is the key to the relevant agenda view (so, e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*).
 Now, if I set org-agenda-buffer-name to e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*, I get org-store-link to work as expected when visiting an agenda buffer with that name. But I do not seem to be able to use org-agenda-buffer-name to get Emacs to recognize an agenda buffer when org-agenda-sticky is set to t.
 Any ideas?

 I have been participating in the Haskell community since 2009. In that time I have learned a great deal from Haskellers around the world including Eastern Europe. I have the greatest wish for the safety of all Haskellers, from all parts of the world. You are all my friends, even though we have only met virtually.

I've been using The Archive for about a year and a half and it has been a remarkable tool for me to organize my torrent of thoughts for a variety of projects. I especially love how I'm able to record my thoughts and surf through my notes without needing to take my fingers off the keyboard.
As I have gotten deeper into my research, I've found myself using LaTeX much more frequently, especially for mathematical purposes, and I'd imagine it will be necessary for other tasks as well. Does The Archive support LaTeX? If not, are there some workarounds for this to be possible? What other note-taking software is out there that has bi-directional linking and LaTeX support as well?

Reading from Cache
 Adding to Cache (With Expiration TIme)
 Updating Cache
  
Has someone done this before? Can someone point me to good resource on implementing the same? I tried to do it with a node server and it worked like a charm but while trying to do the same with Scala Play, I am still not getting good enough resources. Can someone help me and give me tips how to approach this to be time and speed efficient?

 I know there is the whitespace-cleanup-mode which does a okay job with the option to only do cleanup when the file was already clean, but i would like to go further and only do whitespace cleanup on the lines i have modified.
 anyone would know how to replicate this feature?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created the package clean-kill-ring.el which solves a problem that I have long been annoyed with which is controlling what is allowed in the kill-ring.
 This package provides a clean-kill-ring-mode minor mode, that when active prevents any killed text that satisfies a predicate in clean-kill-ring-filters from entering the kill ring. By default the only active filter is string-blank-p to keep whitespace out of the kill ring.
 You can automatically remove duplicate items if you set clean-kill-ring-prevent-duplicates to a non-nil value.
 Hopefully some people find this useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm experimenting with a new form of inlining. Not sure if it has been done yet. The basic idea is to try to interpret the scala code and specialize at comp time, instead of traditionally inlining and constant folding. The following code failed to compile in my machine, reporting as  Main.scala:6:19 Maximal number of successive inlines (32) exceeded, Maybe this is caused by a recursive inline method? You can use -Xmax-inlines to change the limit. val result = fib(i) 
 ```scala inline def fib(a: Int): Int = if a <= 1 then a else fib(a - 1) + fib(a - 2)
 def timed_fib(i: Int): Unit = val begin = System.currentTimeMillis() val result = fib(i) val tm = System.currentTimeMillis() - begin println(s"fib(${i})=$result $tm ms")
 @main def main(): Unit = timed_fib(2) ```
 If we take the interpreter and specializing approach, inline is not needed ```scala def fib(a: Int): Int = if a <= 1 then a else fib(a - 1) + fib(a - 2)
 def timed_fib(i: Int): Unit = val begin = System.currentTimeMillis() val result = fib(i) val tm = System.currentTimeMillis() - begin println(s"fib(${i})=$result $tm ms")
 @main def main(): Unit = timed_fib(2)  will be optimized to scala def timed_fib_2: Uint = val begin = System.currentTimeMillis() val result = 1 val tm = System.currentTimeMillis() - begin println(s"fib(${i})=$result $tm ms")
 @main def main(): Unit = timed_fib_2 ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The built-in bibtex-mode provides a function bibtex-next-field which does what you'd expect: if we use "|" to represent point, calling bibtex-next-field from the following configuration: 
  @article{key, author = {D|oe, Jane}, title = {A paper}, ... 
 will take you to this configuration:
  @article{key, author = {D|oe, Jane}, title = {A paper|}, ... 
 I'm trying to define a bibtex-previous-field function that does the reverse, so I decided to look into the definition of bibtex-next-field, which is this:
 ``` (defun bibtex-next-field (begin &optional comma) "Move point to end of text of next BibTeX field or entry head. With prefix BEGIN non-nil, move point to its beginning. Optional arg COMMA is as inbibtex-enclosing-field'. It is t for interactive calls." (interactive (list current-prefix-arg t)) (let ((bounds (bibtex-find-text-internal t nil comma)) end-of-entry) (if (not bounds) (setq end-of-entry t) (goto-char (nth 3 bounds)) (if (assoc-string (car bounds) '("@String" "@Preamble") t) (setq end-of-entry t) ;; BibTeX key or field (if (looking-at ",[ \t\n]") (goto-char (match-end 0))) ;; end of entry (if (looking-at "[)}][ \t\n]") (setq end-of-entry t)))) (if (and end-of-entry (re-search-forward bibtex-any-entry-maybe-empty-head nil t)) (goto-char (match-beginning 0))) (bibtex-find-text begin nil bibtex-help-message)))
 ````
 Unfortunately, I'm having trouble parsing this. What is the expression end-of-entry doing? I thought let expressions would take the following form: 
  (let ((VAR-1 VALUE-1) (VAR-2 VALUE-2) ... (VAR-n VALUE-n)) BODY) 
 but the first argument of let in the definition of bibtex-next-field seems to have a different form: 
  ... (let ((bounds (bibtex-find-text-internal t nil comma)) end-of-entry) BODY ... 
 Any help making sense of this would be much appreciated.

I recently started a job where we use an exchange server and access it online via outlook webmail. The org-capture browser function doesn't work well for this because the link to the message is (1) not easily captured and (2) is not persistent, e.g., it changes when I move the message to a different folder
 So I started using mu4e again, but it appears that refiling does not seem to sync. When I refile messages in mu4e it somehow disappears and I can't find it in outlook, even though the message is in the correct folder in my maildir. Why would this be? 
 I made a test folder in outlook to see if that would sync and it did sync, and the folder appeared in my maildir
 I then made that folder the location of my refile function, and same thing happened, the message disappeared and is no longer visible in outlook. 
 
  
Any thoughts on why refiling messages makes them disappear? Is it just some exchange server setting that I can't get around, or is it an easy fix on my end? 
 Thank you!

 I'm using vhdl-mode a lot and just decided that it would be a great idea to include compiler vhdl-mode option into my workflow with Emacs. I have to say that I set custom file location for "Easy configuration" on Emacs. 
 (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/emacs-custom.el")
 (load custom-file)
 To select compiler in vhdl-mode there are two ways, and it is little bit confusing to me. I want to use Xilinx XST compiler. Let me explain.
 First, you can select compiler from drop-down menu. There are Compiler1 and Compiler2 options. If you tinker with these options, some text is saved to my emacs-custom.el file, but I can't see that something is configured there. To me it seems like it copied just to whole compilers list into that emacs-custom.el. Maybe it saves some options in other place too and I'm not aware of it?
 Second, which works, but its value is not saved anywhere! It looks like this. I have tried to put (vhdl-set-compiler "Xilinx XST")
 and it returned that error that function is void. If I do it manually by fallowing vhdl-mode drop-down menu, and then selecting "Xilinx XST" compiler, it works. But just in this emacs session. After the restart of emacs, I have to do it again manually :/ 
 my emacs-custom.el : https://pastebin.com/iaTQbK17
 my init.el : https://pastebin.com/4GNLJMQB
 Any help is appreciated :)

 So, I've been exploring ways of implementing "type-dependent"(i think this is the name) validations! But I just stepped into a doubt that is related to "scala-specific" knowledge.
 Lets imagine that I have the following error trait:
 scala sealed trait DomainError trait ValidationError extends DomainError 
 and I want to specify a generic interface for a given Id type that wraps a primitive! This is what I thought on writing:
 scala trait Id[ValueType] type Value val value: ValueType 
 First question: - Is this the right way of writing a trait which defines something like a ProductId that is, basically, Id[UUID]?
 Second Question: - How can I define the interface for the apply method which I should return something like Either[ValidationError[ProductId], ProductId]]?

Kinds are built from a single atomic kind, written * and pronounced type, and a single constructor ?. They include, for example:
 * the kind of proper types (like Bool and Bool=>Bool)
 *=>* the kind of type operators (i.e., functions from proper types to proper types)
 *=>*=>* the kind of functions from proper types to type operators (i.e., two-argument operators)
 (*=>*)=>* the kind of functions from type operators to proper types
 Kinds, then, are the types of types. In essence, the system of kinds is a copy of the simply typed lambda-calculus, one level up.
  
If thinking of types as objects in a category, e.g. Hask in Haskell,
  
what is kind * in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? Is it exactly the set of all the types, i.e. the object set of Hask?
 
What is kind *=>* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? Is it exactly the class Functor in Haskell?
 
What is kind *=>*=>* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask?
 
What is kind (*=>*)=>* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? 
 
Are all the arrow kinds (*=>*, *=>*=>*, (*=>*)=>*, ...) exactly the classes defined by class in Haskell?
 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my work often it happens that I get a call to provide immediate support. Only after the call register it under my Support Headline with a full description of the issue and update my org clock time accordingly. 
 As such, I would like to create an org capture template (or function) that does the following: 
 - request how much time has pass since I receive the call 
 - with this time, clock out of my current task with the time of when I receive the call
 - create a new heading under my *Support* heading and include a clock drawer already with the time I spent on the task. Fill new headline as I want (title, description, etc.) 
 - (optional) clock in again to the task I was working
 I almost got everything done, however it seems that calling =org-clock-out= from within the capture template makes it so that the new heading is not in the right place. 
 If someone has any ideas on how to achieve this let me know. Below you can see my capture template and function:
  ("cc" "Support" entry (file+headline "~/org/todos.org" "Support") "%(call-interactively #'custom/quick-support)" :empty-lines 1) (defun custom/quick-support (minutes-started) (interactive "NMinutes:") (let ((support-start-time (encode-time (decoded-time-add (decode-time) (make-decoded-time :minute (- minutes-started)))))) ;; If clocked in a task, stopped it when support started (org-clock-out nil t support-start-time) (concat "* %?\n :CLOCKING:\n CLOCK: " (format-time-string "[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]" support-start-time) "--" ;; Insert dummy => and let Org calculate it afterwards (format-time-string "[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]") " => \n:END:\n")))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, I have two unrelated questions. I have been assigned to do a task to cover for someone. This largely entails copying details out of a template and pasting it into an excel doc. Due to the variety of the email responses, I copy a block from Outlook to an org file and format, then paste into Excel. For example, a person's name is two cells, I found it was quicker for me to put the first and last names on separate lines then copy, esp after I customized copy*.
 1- can I somehow copy the text, so if I copy multiple lines, it fills the cells correctly? Ex first name is column A, last in b.
 2- I have set up an org file, to dump this data, via capture, mostly so I can easily keep a log of when I enter due to an unrelated headache. I have a custom DONE keyword and associated it with a key, but more than often I accidentally have shift held, so org-todo quits. Is there a way to apply my keyword regardless if i press a or A for example? In org-capture, if I assigned a, but do A, we're told to try again. I am aware that allowing this could cause issues if I assign lower and upper to keywords.
 my function
  (defun me/kill-ring-save () "Adds to line to kill-ring if not marked, and puts a message in the minibuffer. If something is marked, that region is added." (interactive) (if (equal mark-active nil) (progn (kill-ring-save (point) (line-end-position)) (message "Copied the line!") ) (progn (kill-ring-save (point) (mark)) (message "Copied selected region!") ) ) )

Do expressions satisfy these identities, which may be used as a translation into the kernel, after eliminating empty stmts:
 do {e} = e do {e;stmts} = e >> do {stmts} do {p <- e; stmts} = let ok p = do {stmts} ok _ = fail "..." in e >>= ok do {let decls; stmts} = let decls in do {stmts} 
  
I often see that people wrote
 do {p <- e; stmts} = e >>= (\p -> do {stmts}) 
  
I was wondering when the shorten version works and when it doesn't? (Does it work if and only if e is return(e') for some e' that matches p?)
 
Can the one given in the specification be rewritten as a >>= expression, for example, still by lambda expression? (The specification gives a let expression containing a >>= expresssion, not exactly a >>= expression itself)
 
 Thanks.

 I want to try out Emacs and I want to set it up as a python IDE and play around with some other features (DOOM, evil-mode etc., Tramp mode) so I look up how to configure something and I am presented with this:
  
Let's start by configuring lsp-mode which is a client for LSP servers:
 (use-package lsp-mode :hook (prog-mode . lsp))
 (use-package lsp-ui)
  
Okay, great it's a piece of code. but am I supposed to copy/paste that code somewhere? run it? bask in it's glory? do I have to restart emacs?
 Also where in the Emacs for beginners tutorials does it explain what to do with such a configuration snippet? If you have a lot of configuration how do you organize it?
 If I need to find out what configuration options are available for a package (like tramp on windows, how do I tell it to use TortoiseGitPlink.exe instead of Plink.exe) how do I discover it?

 I'd like to write an embark function for the consult-ripgrep.
 This function can add the current file name to the search prompt.
 What I mean:
 The consult ripgrep prompt is: #whatilookfor
 and after the embark action the prompt is: #whatilookfor -- -g filename*.differentextension
 I can image that if we add this "-- -g filename*.differentextension" to the consult-history and I can reach it with M-p maybe it can be a different good solution 
 I would like to use it to search the string in the files with same name but different extensions.
 It would be useful under the angular development for me ...
 If you can send me an example where an embark function modify the consult prompt could be enough for me 
 sorry for the question but I have no a lot of time to write code for emacs ... :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Sorry for the basic question. I was reading that both native compilation and pure gtk were both merged. I'm on fedora 35. What is the best way to install emacs with these features? Do I have to build it from source? And if so are there specific flags or options that need to be enabled for it to be compiled with those options enabled? or are they enabled by default now?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: I managed to build it from source using the following and it (mostly) works:
 Into a directory: git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git
 Then ran: ./autogen.sh in that directory
 Then ran: ./configure --with-pgtk --with-native-compilation --with-mailutils
 It kept failing until I installed all the following additional packages with sudo dnf install:
  
autoconf (to run the ./autogen.sh command)
 texinfo (for the makeinfo requirement)
 gtk3-devel (for the pgtk requirement)
 libgccjit-devel (for the native-comp requirement)
 gnutls-devel (because it needed gnutls-devel)
 ncurses-devel (it needed something in this package but I forget what)
  
Then ran make (took a while) then sudo make install in the directory and it installed! Emacs 29 I believe to /usr/local/bin

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to get this to work to immediately activate a defun that I just added to my init.el (instead of closing and reopening emacs). I thought eval-defun should work. Alternatively, C-x C-e worked fine. So first question is why doesn't this work, and a second question, I guess, is when should I use each version?
 I don't know if it matters, but my init.el indicates it's an "(Emacs-Lisp Eldoc)". Here's the function:
 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; help with parens (show-paren-mode t) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; emacs needs an unfill ;;; Stefan Monnier <foo at acm.org>. It is the opposite of fill-paragraph (defun unfill-paragraph (&optional region) "Takes a multi-line paragraph and makes it into a single line of text." (interactive (progn (barf-if-buffer-read-only) '(t))) (let ((fill-column (point-max)) ;; This would override `fill-column' if it's an integer. (emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column t)) (fill-paragraph nil region))) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; Some font choices (setq myfont "InputSerif") 
 With the point in or immediately after the defun, executing C-M-x aka M-x eval-defun prints "InputSerif" in the minibuffer.
 EDIT: Added extra context to my snippet, command above and below.

I have discovered zettelkasten(ing) a few weeks ago and it arrived at a perfect timing! I am reorganizing my whole “knowledge management” and my workflow.  As a dad of two small kids, the primary caretaker of a house and a phd candidate during pandemic times (I don’t know what went through my head to pursue that route), I highly need some effectivity.
I have started my own zettelkasten and I am trying at the same time to understand how the zettelkasten system works and most importantly how to make it most effective for me. And let’s be honest, I am really torn between analog and digital and see benefits in both. I like the tactile and sensory aspect of the analog, and I like the effectiveness of the digital, plus I learn a lot on software and programmes (thanks to you Forum, markdown has come to my knowledge and I am learning how to use it).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering how to understand in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor
  
Applicative functors are the programming equivalent of lax monoidal functors with tensorial strength in category theory.
  
In Haskell's, class Applicative is defined as
 class Functor f => Applicative f where pure::a->fa (<*>)::f(a->b)->fa->fb 
 A monoidal functor is defined in Mac Lane's book Category Theory for Working Mathematicians, on p164 in VII.1. Monoidal Categories 
  
A (strict) morphism of monoidal categories 
 T: (B, *, e, alpha, lambda, rho)->(B', *', e', alpha, lambda, rho), 
 is a functor T: B-B' such that, for all a, b, c, f, and g 
 T(a*b)=Ta *' Tb, T(f*g) = Tf *' Tg, Te=e', (10) T alpha_{a,b,c} = alpha'_{Ta, Tb, Tc}, T lambda_a = lambda'_{Ta}, T rho = rho'_{Ta}. (11) 
  
How can an instance of class Applicative be viewed as a lax monoidal functor? 
 What is the underlying monoidal category (B, *, e, alpha, lambda, rho) for an instance of Applicative in Haskell?
 What is "lax" here?
 Thanks.

 I know you can select a region and auto indent it by pressing C-M-\, however that doesn't seem to remove hanging braces even though my style is set to not have hanging braces.
 For example, if I highlight the following function and run auto indent
 test_function(void) { std::cout << "This is a test" << std::endl; } 
 I would like it to become 
 test_function(void){ std::cout << "This is a test" << std::endl; } 
 but it doesn't. Anyone know how to make emacs do this?

A quick google lead me to a github issue for lsp-mode that said it's a common problem and that Flycheck was going to release a new version that fixed it. There was linked issue from that one to a github issue on Flycheck's repo about releasing said version from 2020, with no actual traction on finishing the release.
 There haven't been any commits to master since August 2021, regardless of the fact that there are 45 open pull requests, and users requesting that a new release be cut for 2 years. Their CI jobs don't run anymore because they're linked to travis-ci.org which has been in read-only mode since July 2021 and no longer accepts new build jobs.
 Is Flycheck dead? Are people just using snapshots from the repo to make it work? Is there a forked version someone is actually mantaining?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am having trouble with my org-mode. Whenever I have a heading, like "* This is a heading" and press RET, I used to be brought to a newline, and moved inwards 3 characters. However, when I press RET currently, under a heading such as in this example, point is not moved, and remains at 0 instead of being moved to 3. Interestingly, when I am in auto-fill-mode, when the text begins to wrap around, it will indent appropriately. I have also found that C-o also does not indent, and is effectively the same as C-j
 I am not sure what has changed, but I am in wayland currently, and I don't think that should have and impact on expected performance, but I would never know.
 I tried org-indent-mode to see if that is what I was missing, but that seems to be doing something else entirely.
 ​
 EDIT: fixed, i had to set org-adapt-indentation
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Hard-indentation.html#DOCF150
 ​
 EDIT2: This change does not seem to be working out, actually. I thought it would, but I still get put at 0 instead of 3 spaces when I use RET under a headline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to syntactic flexibility with do notation, I really can't see a single language paradigm that Haskell can't emulate. While Prelude gets a lot of shit, it's so minimal and unopinionated that it really encourages creating language features as libraries. With QuasiQuoters you can take this to a logical extreme, convincing the compiler to compile whatever you want essentially. It seems to take very little convincing to get the language to do anything you want in the way you want as long as it's logically well formed.
 Personally as someone who loves programming language design it's really incredible, if there's a feature in another language that I want to try, I don't have to switch languages, I can find a package or just stub out an implementation in a weekend. I've heard this used as a point against Haskell however, because it lets you work with very bizzare computational models and can make a code base feel kind of disjointed. Personally, I don't buy that, while Haskell does have modules that let you differ from the norm, the norm tends to be the easiest option. You CAN have Alan Kay style objects, you CAN have prolog style logic programming, but why would you when the language is still so effective without them. Of course, eDSLs are a thing too, tho they're less hot pluggable language features and more an incredibly nice design pattern that arises naturally from the language design unless they're designed to operate more generically.
 Anyway, Haskell is cool and I wanted to talk about it, but I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am making a Haskell application that uses a lot of libraries, mostly for things like parsing (megaparsec, aeson, etc) and eventually some RPC or other inter-process library. I have noticed that many of these libraries will return some kind of "Result" type for actions that can fail, often an Either String a or Maybe a or their own custom Result a type. I find it somewhat vexing how these different error types cannot mix because they carry different information, and I would like to be able to propagate them to a higher level in my program where the errors can be handled properly.
 To this end I have added a monadic Result type for my own application that is roughly data Result a = Valid a | Invalid Error where Error is my own error sum type that can represent any external error that the program might have to handle. Result has the obvious Functor, Applicative, and Monad instances, and I use it to wrap most actions that can fail including reading and writing files, parsing, validating user input, and so on.
 Is this a good approach? It seems a little unwieldy to set up so many wrapper functions, but it pays off when I can handle the errors so much more smoothly at the top level. Is there some better method I am missing?

I’ve enabled svelte-mode and installed the svelte-ls lsp server, but things like lsp-find-definition just error out and ask me to check lsp-describe-server, which shows that the server is alive, but not much else. Any tips? I have to explore a codebase, and being able to quickly follow definitions is key.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm curious to see how you plan your long term goals with org-mode. I'm interested in workflows and your thoughts.
 In general, I'm pretty successful managing my day to day with org-mode:
  
I have a project list 
 each project is divided into subtasks
  
I push the projects along by executing tasks and reviewing my projects relatively regularly. It's a functional system. In general things don't fall through the cracks.
 However, I feel like most of my planning is short term. This is where "tactical vs strategic" in the title comes from. I'm having trouble elaborating on what I really mean, here.
 Do you have long term goals, if so how do you work with them in org mode?

 From my one semester of Haskell in university I know the basic concepts, but I now want to write a full backend in Haskell.
 I have been using Kotlins Flows for quite a while, and I am looking for something similar in Haskell. Specifically I want to be able to notify other threads about changes, so they can react to them, but not in an active waiting way. In Kotlin I would use a StateFlow or a SharedFlow for this. I've seen the pipes library which looks very similar, but I couldn't figure out to use it in a way, where I have to update a value in one place and all threads are notified about it.
 Probably I am still thinking too much in an imperative way, but maybe you can help me go into the right direction. Thank you for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been spending hours trying to figure this out, but was unable to find anything online with any working examples of what I'm looking for.
 ​
 What I want to do is have one of my Akka-HTTP routes return a response like this:
 [ { name: "test", age: 24 }, { name: "test 2", age: 21 } ] 
 The issue is that the spray-json and akka tutorials only show you how to return a response like this:
 { users: [ { name: "test", age: 24 }, { name: "test 2", age: 21 } ] } 
 While messing around, I tried creating a simple route an an immutable sequence of users like so
 case class User(name: String, age: Int) // ... val usersTest = Seq(User("test, 24), User("test 2", 21)) val routes: Route = { ... route code get { // Should return an array of the users complete(usersTest) } } 
 But the above code throws the following error:
 type mismatch; found : Seq[User] required: akka.http.scaladsl.marshalling.ToResponseMarshallable 
 I'm having a hard time following why that error is being thrown when I have my jsonFormats defined already:
 implicit val userJsonFormat = jsonFormat2(User) 
 ​
 How can I make the route respond with a simple JSON array of the users? I don't want to respond with an object containing a users array, I want the endpoint to respond with an array of the users.
 ​
 Any help is much appreciated!
 Edit: I feel dumb. Thanks for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am new to Org, so I may have missed something obvious but, reading the Quick start guide or the documentation, I am not sure to understand how export is supposed to work in regards to headings. Quoting the Quick start Guide:
  
Lines that start with an asterisk * are headings. 
 A single * denotes a 1st-level heading, ** denotes a 2nd-level heading, etc.
  
So far, everything is clear. We have headings, with levels. Fine. Where I stop following is when I export, say to a html buffer (C-c C-e h H) every heading level has been decreased: one star headings are tagged as h2 and two stars as h3. Here, on a very basic test file: 
 https://preview.redd.it/p9pbaypvm8j81.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=23832603cda8cec5ff07bd711f661d8fe71f2902
 Since I am rather new to Org and to Emacs, I imagined I had some issue with my Org configuration or that I screwed up something elsewhere in Emacs, as I so often do. So I tried on a clean install (no ~/.emacs.d, no init.el) and got the same result, on a Debian 11 machine btw. 
 What's bugging me is that I can't find mention of this in the doc. 
 Could you tell me if it is the expected behavior? And if so, is there a way to tell Org to preserve the original heading levels?
 Thank you :)

The inclusion of the zettelkasten into the lexicon of contemporary productivity scenes, many of which view note-taking systems through the lens of task and project management, has led to confusion as to what a zettelkasten is and for what it can be used. This confusion becomes particularly apparent when comparing zettelkasten to other note-taking methodologies, where the zettelkasten is seen as an advanced (and sometimes outdated) way to store and retrieve notes. I'd like to argue that the zettelkasten should not be considered within the lineage of agnostic note-storing systems and apps, but rather as something else entirely: a note-making and note-linking me…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I have a sequence of semigroups, for example strings and arrays. I want to fold all of them with append, producing a sequence of the folded values.
 I imagine different semigroups have different implementations of append. However, while the compiler can know it'll have to deal with some manner of semigroup, it cannot know ahead of time what each member may be. How is the correct function ultimately determined? Is there some runtime check with the equivalent of typeof/instanceof which decides the correct function?
 I guess a related question is what happens in practice if data don't match their type? For example, if I ask a database for data, expecting a sequence of integers, but a cosmic ray conspires to ruin my day, and I end up getting garbage. Obviously this is a runtime error, but how can I reason about it or deal with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have just released new versions of both Indigo (game engine) and Tyrian (Elm-like web framework). They've been release together because they now work together!
 As well as lots of other improvements, you are now able to build a web app in Tyrian that natively launches and communicates with Indigo web games as first class citizens, from within the same Scala codebase.
 The motivating use case was for people who wanted to use Indigo to render their games, but who also wanted a slick, responsive HTML5 based UI to drive it.
 Please note that both minor releases follow an unannounced major release a week ago, so do check out the release notes for both. 
 Indigo 0.12.1 - https://indigoengine.io/
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.12.0
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.12.1
 Tyrian 0.3.1 - http://tyrian.indigoengine.io/
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.3.0
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.3.1
 ​
 A massive thank you to all the wonderful people who have sponsored us, contributed code, reviewed PR's, written/proof read docs, raised issues, discussed solutions, or bravely shared their work in progress games and apps! You make it all worth while. 😊

 I don't have csharp-mode hooks enabled in my dot emacs, so I load a ".cs" file, and then type "M-x csharp-mode". I get this error:

 Syntax highlighting does NOT occur (except for strings and comments, for some reason). However, the mode line does say that csharp-mode IS activated for the file. 
 I don't understand why R-mode is involved with this process at all. I do have ESS installed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I attempt to gather all ideas/approaches that were in usage to manage app dependencies. As far as I see there are two survivors nowadays: - mix of constructors/implicits in Tagless Final world - "Reader on steroids" represented by ZIO (Reader channel, Has[T], and ZLayer) and cats-mtl (Ask[F, T] feature) (thanks to u/LuciaDenniard for bringing the second option)
 I want to write a note with a review of which things were in usage but were washed out.
 The roster I have:
  
Dependency rejection. Just an idea to push any IO to the edges and not mix with logic.
 Dependency injection frameworks (Guice-like)
 Cake pattern.
 Dependency parameterization (dependencies as function parameters).
 Reader monad (as is)
 
 Resources I found useful: - "Readers vs Constructors: Dependency Injection showdown" and "Reader & Constructor-based Dependency Injection - friend or foe?" by u/adamw1pl - "Dependency Injection in Functional Programming" Gist by Gabriel Volpe - Cake antipattern by Mateusz Kubuszok - "Six approaches to dependency injection" from "F# for Fun and Profit" - "Dependency rejection" and "Partial application is dependency injection" by Mark Seemann
 I'll be grateful for any additional resources and/or points I've missed.
 Thank you!

But it seems to me that even if I replaced f with g :: (a,b) then g is still ambiguous (again, if I have multiple instances). So why is there that restriction?
 I am aware of FunctionalDependencies, but it seems to me that it shouldn't be required that b is uniquely determined by a. Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you have a high level language it seams easier to desugar it to a small core language when type checking. However I don't understand how type errors can then be reversed back to the original syntax. What are known strategies for doing this? It seems like you would have to litter your core AST with annotations of some kind, is this what most people do?
 I remember reading somewhere that haskell implements the typechecker closer to the original syntax because then it is easier to relate errors to the original source. However there is still some desugaring that occurs, and I'm wondering if there is a sweet spot in balancing desugaring vs tracking original source?

Is this the expected behaviour?
 Can I trim this down to one Org version, preferably the 9.5.2 and the generally speaking the most recent one?
 If this is the expected behaviour what is the purpose of each Org version? I find it strange that I cannot use the most recent stable version but still need it for dependencies.

Last Week
Completed the initial processing of notes from the biography of John Cage Where The Heart Beats 202107261132.
Spent too much time fretting about the Science Profile assignment interview that never happened.
Looked again at Zettlr then settled back into The Archive.
This Week
I'll add deep links and atomize Where The Heart Beats 202107261132. I'll start a second refactoring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
I recently discovered the Zettelkasten system and thought it seemed a disciplinary and constructive tool for someone who makes connections between ideas all day long but doesn't write them down (like me). I've gotten as far as downloading Obsidian, reading the first chapter of a book called "The Bitcoin Standard," writing fleeting notes, and then polishing the relevant ones into literature notes. What repeatedly evades my understanding, however, is the nature of links.
I do not know when or how to use links. For example, if I have a note that defines the economic term "coincidence of wants," and I have another note discussing how "indirect exchange enables coincidence of wants in a diverse economy," should I: reference "coincidence" inside "indirect exchange"; reference "indirect exchange" in "coincidence"; do both of those; not link them at all but tag both notes with "coincidence of wants" and find them when I do the color-coded tag search?
And then there's the matter of linking two (seemingly) unrelated ideas. Do they get linked to each other, and then to a third note of the new idea they inspire? Both notes separately linked to the third?
Help is appreciated.]]></summary>

 Binding globally, every one of these works except C-k. It will NOT move to the upper window in either Eshell or term, normal mode or no. I tried to use bind* from use-package, I tried general, I tried so many things I've lost count, but I can't use C-k for the real shell or the Eshell. Why is this, and is there a sane way around it? For now I've settled down on using arrows:
  (general-define-key :states 'normal "<left>" 'windmove-left "<right>" 'windmove-right "<down>" 'windmove-down "<up>" 'windmove-up)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've used them infrequently enough and used different ones every time. And then when I ask people about it, I get 10x different answers. 
 I just want a simple (synchronous) HTTP client and JSON parser (where I can make case classes to extract what I need). Now when I look I try one out and the example doesn't compile in 2.11, or I try another one out and the client is overkill, etc. 
 I have interviews next week, and I just want the simplest go-to HTTP Client/json parser that I don't have to think too hard about. There are so many options that this becomes a really frustrating exercise. 
 Kind of a rant, but also a cry for help.

 ```
 +begin_src bash :async t
 for i in $(seq 10); do echo $i && sleep 0.1 done
 +end_src
 ```
 I have a pretty basic need to view the stdout of this process (i.e. view numbers from 1 to 10 printed out to an external buffer, much like async-shell-command), not only the final result.
 Is this feasible to do this? If this were feasible it would be convenient to view the process of my long-running command. And I can totally live free from the terminal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross post from https://fillian.me/code/bongo-retag/
 ​
 bongo is a package for listening to music within Emacs.
 I keep all my music on my computer with filenames readable by bongo like this:
 Artist - Album - Track Num - Song Name.mp3
 ​
 I like having all the metadata stored in the filename instead of in internal ID3 tags for a few reasons:
  
filenames are easy to change
 everything is visible at a glance
 it stops me from spending too much time re-tagging and organizing my library
  
​
 The problem is that when I sync my music library to my phone using Syncthing, the music app I use doesn't read the metadata from the filename - it uses the standard ID3 tags.
 ​
 My solution was to write a small script which reads metadata from the filename and overwrites the internal ID3 tags to match.
 Whenever I add new music to my library, I'll run this script and then I'll be able to browse easily on my phone. The source of truth for metadata will always be the filename.
 ​
 The script is written in Python and requires a library called eyeD3
 You can find the it here
 Pass the script a directory and it will re-tag all the .mp3 files inside and in any sub-directories.
 ​
 It's nice to have album cover images when listening on my phone, so the script will overwrite a cover image if there is a file that matches Artist - Album.jpg in the same directory as the mp3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm following the system crafters' guide "emacs from scratch", and in the video on LSP, I wrote down the three things he says are needed:
 1. a backend (lsp-mode in his case)
 2. a frontend (typescript-mode in his case)
 3. a language server (ts-ls in his case)
 So I was wondering if this scheme holds true even for c/c++, if so, what packages for these three "categories" do I need?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a program that transcodes financial statements into a ledger. In that program I have types representing different activities:
 haskell data Withdrawal = Withdrawal { wTarget :: !Text, wAmount :: !Cash, wBalance :: !Cash } data Fee = { fFee :: !Cash, fBalance :: !Cash } -- many more 
 I use those types, because I have functions that are transaction-type specific.
 I also wanted to write an activity parser that translates CSV records into those types, so I created an Activity sum type:
 ```haskell data Activity = ActivityFee Fee | ActivityWithdrawal Withdrawal | -- ...
 parseActivity :: CsvRecord -> Activity ```
 That Activity is quite boilerplate'y. Having to have a new Activity* constructor for a new activity type is slightly cumbersome.
 Is there a more idiomatic or better design pattern for this problem? Was it C++, std::variant would be convenient, because adding a new activity type wouldn't entail adding a new boilerplate constructor.
 I've considered type-classes, but the problem with them is that they are not closed and I can't pattern match to create a function like applyActivity :: Activity -> Wallet -> Wallet. I see that I could make applyActivity into a function of an Activity class, but then problem is that this solution is only straightforward if only one argument is using this pattern. If we had two arguments like foo :: (ClassOne a, ClassTwo b) => a -> b -> c, then it's not clear to which class foo should belong.
