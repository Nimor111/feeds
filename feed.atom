        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In procedural/OOP laguages, for loops are O(1) space because they can mutate a single variable.
 If each iteration in a functional program is a recursive function call, would it result in n levels of recursion and hence O(n) space usage in the stack? This seems pretty absurd but I can't find any resources on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used doom emacs for a while, but over the last couple of weeks wrote my own config, to be a bit more flexible.
 I want to use org-agenda, and in doom emacs I just let it check all my files under "~/org/", so I can create TODOs everywhere and don't have to think about what I should be putting in which todo file - or manage a single one.
 To achieve this, I have the following lines in my init.el:
 emacs-lisp (use-package org :pin org :commands (org-capture org-agenda) :config ;; agenda (setq org-agenda-start-with-log-mode t) (setq org-log-done 'time) (setq org-log-into-drawer t) (setq org-directory "~/org/") (setq org-agenda-files '("~/org/"))) 
 I always run emacs as a daemon, and this is annoying for two reasons: 1. My recentf history is always filled with org files. I want them there, but not if they were opened by the org-agenda scan 2. I have a lot of org buffers initially
 How can I solve this? Or am I doing something which is not intended? I had the same setup in doom emacs, but never noticed that my recentf history or my buffers are spammed with agenda files. I want the agenda files on startup to work with the emacs-dashboard. I'm somewhat confused that this is not a more common problem, as I'm not sure how else I should be using org-agenda
 What I tried so far
  
do not keep org-agenda-files open after generating agenda I don't understand that quiet though, I don't want a solution that closes buffers when I close the agenda buffer
 Prevent recentf from being flooded - Reddit I neither want to ignore all my org files though

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have a huge org file, and I get this error "end of file during parsing".
 This usually means I have parenthesis not matching somewhere, I started removing the chapters of my files one by one, and retried to tangle: no change, I got the same error everytime, this does not make sense to me, I should have been able to tangle at some point!!
 I tried with a diff (I have a backup of this file), but I am not good at reading diff buffers (and I only discovered difftastic yesterday... that I can not implement, due to the error...).
 It forces me to get better at dealing with changes in my configuration ==> I will better document the changes from now on (Magit)
 Now to my question:
 Is there an emacs function that checks code blocks only, ignoring the litterate content? Using the #+BEGIN_SRC and #+END_SRC entries to locate the blocks, and only checking the content for syntax errors?
 Thanks for your support!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever thought to yourself, why should I give Emacs commands like a plebian, when an LLM can just control Emacs for me? Well the first step is now done, we now have a way to make any elisp command callable by an LLM that does function calling. For example, here is me switching buffers by telling the LLM to switch buffers by just describing the buffer I want switched to. It's not exactly a huge time-saver, but it's cool and shows the potential.
 ​
 https://i.redd.it/fy6jnbp2w1kc1.gif
 In my llm package, I've created a new function calling branch after learning that Ollama will soon support function calling. Right now both Open AI and Gemini do this (but Gemini has some limitations). As part of that, I have a utility to use function calling to create function definitions for elisp functions (which aren't really rich enough in information to be passed to function calls as-is).
 I'll be thinking about interesting new interactions that can be built off by having the LLM just control emacs via a few predefined commands. But it's quite useful for certain things where you want the LLM to produce structured information. For example, I created a function that will create an example sentence given a word in a language, and then it can be passed to anki, etc. These things were a bit painful to do previously.
 As normal, I'm not planning on creating an actual end-user package here, but I want to encourage people to think about what can be done using function calling and, if there is something you want to put into a package, use the `llm` package to make it easy and portable (somewhat). Ideas and feedback are most welcome!

I want a bunch of concatenated items to (ideally) be the same type as a single item. (A Semigroup, in other words, I think?) And of course a function that prints it out to the terminal.
 So I want to do something like:
 t = R "some red text, " <> G "some green text, " <> Y "and some yellow!" printColor t 
 I've tried a couple of ways and haven't been super happy, wondering if there's a better way!
 Attempt 1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reading through the Elisp of alphapapa's immensely useful package burly.el, I came across this function definition:
 (defun burly--bookmark-window-state-hack (&optional _)
 (unwind-protect
 (progn
 (cl-assert burly--window-state)
 (window-state-put burly--window-state (frame-root-window)))
 (setf bookmark-after-jump-hook (delete #'burly--bookmark-window-state-hack bookmark-after-jump-hook)
 burly--window-state nil)))
 I could not figure out the function argument, "_". The function body does not reference it. The argument's name seems to be intentionally non-descriptive.
 I Googled for information about Emacs and the underscore character but found nothing helpful. Then I asked ChatGPT, which replied:
 ​
  
In Emacs Lisp, when the underscore _ character is used as an argument to a function, it conventionally indicates that the argument is not used within the function body. This is a way to signal to other programmers that the argument is intentionally ignored or not relevant to the function's operation.
  
If the argument is intentionally ignored, at it seems to be, why include it in the first place? Especially when the argument is &optional anyway? What does it add to the function?

These challenges require your program to be a TCP server, accept connections, read some data (sometimes binary, sometimes UTF-8 encoded strings), and reply with some meaningful data.
 I've made decent headway in Haskell's flavor of socket programming, using Network.Socket and Network.Socket.ByteString, and have successfully solved the first challenge. I find myself struggling with the myriad ByteString types, in that I'm constantly fighting to determine which flavor of ByteString each function needs and how to convert between them. When there's this much of a struggle, I feel like I might be going about it the wrong way and would appreciate any insight here.

  void main(){ pri } 
 and select the top option (printf) it gives me
  #include <stdio.h> void main(){ printf(const char *, ...) }  Which puts my cursor on the first argument.
 But if I type in pri in Python and select print it just completes the word without even adding the parenthesis at the end. As a more complete example, I am working with a postgresql database and I type in 
  connection = psycopg2.con  and it completes it to connection = psycopg2.connect but without parens and it also doesn't add in the arguments like how C does with printf. Is this an lsp limitation with Python? I am using an up to date company mode and lsp mode with pyright as my python lsp and clangd as my C lsp.

 Newbie here, I wanted to open file under cursor in a split ... so wrote this elisp function.
 ​
 Just FYI using DOOM emacs.
 (defun rd/evil-find-file-at-point-with-line-split() "lets extend the evil-find-file-at-point-with-line function to open in a split" (interactive) (require 'evil-commands) (let ((display-buffer-alist '(("" (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-below-selected)))) (parent-file (current-buffer))) (evil-find-file-at-point-with-line) (split-window-vertically (- height)) (other-window 1) (pop-to-buffer (parent-file)) ) ) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-w C-f") 'rd/evil-find-file-at-point-with-line-split) 
 It works very inconsistently. File does open but sometimes in the same window, sometimes in a vertical split and sometimes in horizontal split(the intended).

 Can someone please point out what i am doing wrong?

 I'm facing strange problem and couldn't figure out.
 Whenever I turn on jinx-mode in latex buffer, auctex (e.g. LaTeX-mode) automatically turned off and switched to latex-mode.
 Same issue occurs when I turn on jinx-mode globally.
 jinx-mode is perfectly working in other major-mode and auctex also works fine if jinx-mode is not turned on. 
 I tried to reinstall both packages and config them with many different settings

 Is it possible to manually select which files go into each project? Example:
 I have following project strucutre:
 myproject/ 
 -----------/.git 
 -----------/mynotes.org 
 -----------/scripts/ 
 -----------/tests/ 
 -----------/logs/ 
 -----------/data/
 that's the most logical dir set-up and most conveniet way to access file for me most of the time.
 However sometimes say i am working on "pull_rss_feeds" part of my project and need to access related files in scripts, tests, logs, data folders. So is there a way to manually create project pull_rss_feeds and tell exactly what files i want to be part of this projects?
 Another use case is my emacs config. Part of config is in my emacs folder, part is in .emacs.d folder... I would like to manually create emacs project and tell exactly where files are.

 In order to install these language servers, I tried to use npm but I'm not very familiar with it. In particular, if I don't want to install them using root privileges, what should I do? npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted for example, attempts to install everything in /usr/local/lib/node_modules.
 I also tried npm install --save vscode-langservers-extracted to get all packages in a folder but have no idea how to hook it with Eglot.

 if you don't know projectile. it's basically a package that let's you index all your project directories so that later you can just fuzzy find your way to what you want to work on.
 so you look for the project -> tap enter -> then you will be prompted to choose the file from inside that project.
 this is great. but if i close emacs and then i open it again (for whatever reason) i have to look for and re-open the same files i was working on.
 i guess what i need is a way to fuzzy find through my projects (like in projectile) but instead of prompting with choosing a file (after i pick a project) it will re-open the same buffers that were opened last time.
 ps: i sort of asked about this before but i think that i didn't communicate my issue properly.
 thanks

 Let me describe my problem: i installed typescript-language-server protocol on emacs and via npm (don't know why it's required btw, installing both for my system and emacs).
 After 5-6 hours strulling i did it ! I got it working, now i can select any .js file in my react folder, i can activate lsp by "C-x lsp", works totally great until i move on another .js file. The language server works for only one file i'm currently on, i need to enable it for every .js file and that's odd. Can you help me ? Thanks in advance !
 Edit: Thank you u/Bortolo_II , i solved the problem by adding (add-hook 'js-mode-hook 'lsp) to my ~/.config/doom/config.el file then did doom sync and everyting is fine now !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been a sporadic Emacs user. it has been my fav text editor. I love its infinite extensibility compared to alternatives like Vim. However I have been wondering if Emacs is on its way down.
 I guess it all started with the birth of NeoVim about a decade back. The project quickly grew and added features which made it better of an IDE than stock Vim (I think). Now i know Vim is not designed to be an IDE, but many NeoVim users seem to want that functionality. Today neovim has plugins t not only code and autocomplete, but also debug code in most languages. i lbelieve it has been steadily attracting users of stock Vim (and of course Emacs)
 Then enter, VSCode about 6 years ago. I guess this project attracted a lot of users from aother text editors (including Emacs). Today it has an extension for everything. Being backed by microsoft means its always going to be better.
 Now whenever I try to look up solutions for Emacs issues on the web, most posts i see are at least 10 years old. For example, I googled for turning Emacs into a web dev IDE. A lot of reddit and Stackoverflow posts that the search turned up were more than a decade old.
 I am wondering if Emacs is on a steady decline . The fact that it is not available by default on many systems seems to be an additional nail in its grave. Even on this sub, a lot of Emacs lovers who used to post regularly, like redguardfoo and Xah are no longer active
 This makes me sad. I absolutely hate having to install a browser disguised as a text editor (VS Code) which will be obsolete probably by another 5 years. I hope that Emacs stays around. Its infinite extensibility is what i love the most (and of course elisp) 
 Would like to hear your thoughts

Original OP: Hello everyone!
 I use org tables with +NAME: field and usually no code block, example

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
I'm adventuring on the path of a project-filled life. I'm using my ZK to document and reflect on ideas and progress centered around a project-filled life. I'm coming to this late in life; I'm 67, but that doesn't matter. I'm here now, and I've started. We'll see.
Why create a routine of short knowledge cycles, because it's a simple process of recording and reviewing.
I'm looking at OpenAI's ChatGPT as a tutor for exploring ideas.
I'm using my ZK to explore what it means to have an intellectual life.
Things I'm reading:
Sertillanges, A. G. and Ryan, Mary. The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods. 1987.
Zentner, Jeff. The Serpent King. First Ember edition, Ember, an imprint of Random House Children’s Books, a division of Penguin Random House LLC, 2017.
Gardner, Dwight. Upstairs Delicatessen: on eating, reading, reading about eating, and eating while reading. 2024.
Ogawa, Yōko, et al. The Housekeeper and the Professor. Unabridged, Tantor Audio, 2013.
Music I'm listening to:
Fragmente by Felix Rösch
SUSS
Jessy J
Hania Rani
Niklas Paschburg
Ludovico Einaudi
A look at this week's ZK work themes:

The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of Emacs, there's a perennial debate between purists who swear by Emacs' native keybindings and those who find solace in the familiarity of Vim keybindings through Evil Mode. Proponents of Emacs keybindings argue for their extensibility and deep integration with Emacs' ecosystem, while advocates of Evil Mode tout its efficiency and the muscle memory carried over from Vim.
 For those who've made the switch, what are your experiences with either Emacs keybindings or Evil Mode? Did you find one to be more intuitive or productive than the other? How seamless was the transition from Vim to Evil Mode within Emacs? And for Emacs veterans, do you find that sticking to Emacs keybindings offers advantages that outweigh the allure of Evil Mode?
 Share your thoughts, tips, and insights on navigating the Emacs keybindings vs. Vim (Evil Mode) dilemma in Emacs, and help others find their preferred path to a more efficient editing experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get stack traces from a live running GHC (version 9.2.2) compiled Haskell program. 
 I understand I need to send SIGQUIT to the process to get the stacktraces of the currently running threads.
 But everytime I do this I just get the message: "This build does not support backtraces."
 This is what I have done:
  
Our build is using nix, so I've added the following to the overrides for the GHC build:
  
 ghc = old.ghc.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: { configureFlags = oldAttrs.configureFlags ++ ["--enable-dwarf-unwind"]; buildInputs = oldAttrs.buildInputs ++ [pkgs.elfutils]; }); 
  
I've added the following flags to all the builds of our packages:
  
 -ticky -g -fprof-auto -fprof-auto-calls 
  
I added the flag --enable-debug-info to the cabal build command. 
  
I don't know what else to do. The docs say:
  
On POSIX-compatible platforms GHC’s runtime system (when built with libdw support) will produce a stack trace on stderr when a SIGQUIT signal is received
  
It doesn't say here how to build with libdw support, but I read somewhere elsewhere that one needed to add --enable-dwarf-unwind, and indeed when I did that the GHC build initially complained about not being about to find the libdw library until I added elfutils to the buildInputs.
 The error message also doesn't make it clear whether the build of GHC doesn't support backtraces or the build of my executable doesn't support backtraces. Which makes hunting this down even more difficult.
 What am I missing? Is there anyway to ask GHC whether it's compiled with libdw support so I can at least work out whether the problem is with the GHC build or the build of my executable?
 (x-post from https://discourse.haskell.org/t/how-to-get-stack-traces-out-of-ghc-executables/8844 sorry I'm not sure the best place for these questions)

 I recently used Haskell for the 2023 Advent of Code and fell in love with it. I’d love to work more with Haskell professionally, but it doesn’t seem widely used in Web Development.
 Folks using Haskell professionally: what’s your role/industry? How did you get into that type of work? Do you have any advice for someone interested in a similar career?
 Edit: thanks for all the responses so far! It's great to see Haskell being used in so many diverse ways! It's my stop-looking-at-screens time for the night, so I wish you all a good night (or day as the case may be). I really appreciate everyone for sharing your experiences and I'll check in with y'all tomorrow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After reading and experimenting I'm about 99% sure this just isn't possible. Basically, I was trying to lift the api version into the type system to clean up some code so that the focus of the code was on the business logic instead of determining what api version to use in a bunch of places / passing around a isV1 boolean everywhere. This does mean that the api version would need to be determined at runtime, and nothing I've tried has made it able to get the client implicitly. I thought with everything sealed and having implicit defs for both of V1/V2 that it would work, but I'm guessing type erasure / something with subtyping makes it indeterminable. I tried classtags and the aux pattern, but couldn't get it to work. This is scala 2.12 btw. I have something like this:
 sealed trait ApiVersion object ApiVersion { sealed trait V1 extends ApiVersion sealed trait V2 extends ApiVersion } sealed trait ApiClient[Version <: ApiVersion] class V1Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] class V2Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] object ApiClient { implicit def v1Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] = new V1Client implicit def v2Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] = new V2Client } abstract class WrapperDomainObject { type Version <: ApiVersion } object WrapperDomainObject { def apply(thing: ApiThing) = if (/* some business logic */) new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version = ApiVersion.V1 } else new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version = ApiVersion.V2 } } class Service { def serviceFn(thing: WrappedDomainObject)(implicit client: ApiClient[thing.Version]) = client.doBusinessThing } 
 Is this possible?

How do you find notes and chain of thoughts without backlinks, when your ZK grows up?
TL;DR
My ZK is about 455 notes (some atomic, some literature, etc...).
But reading your past threads a question arose in my mind: what happens when my ZK grows bigger, say hundreds or
Furthermore, I realise that the more I get accustomed to backlinks, the more I'm dependent on specific tools such as Obsidian (not all Markdown editors have backlinks).
That is, I'd like to move to IA Writer, that I like much more: it has wikilcnks, but not backlinks.
Hope it makes sense.
Thank you!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently trying to save my org files after every change. I know this might be sub optimal but I want to finish this at least for the purpose of learning how to do something like this.
 So my approach was to add a hook for org mode that adds a hook for after-change-functions. Unfortunately this is active for all files once I've opened an org file. This is the code
 (defun savebuf(begin end length) (if (and (buffer-file-name) (buffer-modified-p)) (save-buffer))) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda() (add-hook 'after-change-functions 'savebuf))) 
 So I added another hook for major mode changes to remove the after-change-functions hook like this
 (defun leave-org-mode-function() (when (eq major-mode 'org-mode) (lambda() (remove-hook 'after-change-functions 'savebuf)))) (add-hook 'change-major-mode-hook 'leave-org-mode-function) 
 Unfortunately this doesn't seem to work. The first hook still stays active and saves everything regardless of major mode. Any Ideas how I could make this work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently upgraded to emacs 29.2 on MacOS Sonoma via brew. Not thoughtfully as a mass update of everything. Things are mostly working with one exception that is very annoying to me. If I enable and use the auto-complete package, quitting emacs takes approximately 40 seconds.
 I've profiled the functions listed in kill-emacs-hook and the problematic function is ac-comphist-save. This function writes out a file: ~/.emacs.d/ac-comphist.dat, which on my system is approximately 73K. I searched and found an exchange about someone having the same problem on an older version of emacs on linux, and the only offered solution was to remove ac-comphist-save from kill-emacs-hook. Sadly, this affects the effectiveness of auto-complete as it doesn't remember what completions you've used repeatedly and r…]]></summary>

As an expert in our field, we are likely to find an answer. However, why not consider a different perspective on potential solutions? Here's a concept for thinking outside the box, beyond the confines of one's own thoughts. The key to a wide array of solutions lies in adapting well-known principles or frameworks from established sciences or schools of thought.

Can you re-find your own solutions to improve your Zettelkasten?

 Sometimes I use VS Code for work, to understand a plugin, and just to explore.
 Window splitting in VS Code drives me nuts. Window management is too closely tied up with tabs. You end up with an hierarchy of "Editor Groups" and "Editors" instead of being able to recall any buffer wherever you want. Then Quick Open (buffer switcher) opens a file multiple times—one per Editor Group. Using VS Code's `revealIfOpen` option partially addresses this, but reveals in the previous Editor Group—it can't recall the file into the Editor Group your cursor is currently in like in Emacs.
 We added `revealIfOpenInActiveGroup` to fix this. This allows you to make VS Code work just like Emacs buffers. Here are the docs for the Get Started page in VS Code docs:
 ### Simulating Buffers
 If you're coming from buffer-centric editors such as Emacs or vi, you can emulate that workflow with:
 "workbench.editor.showTabs": "single",
 "workbench.editor.revealIfOpen": true,
 "workbench.editor.revealIfOpenInActiveGroup": true,
 "workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups": false,
 VS Code has a model where Editors live hierarchically within Editor Groups, and to split your screen you must use Editor Groups. Using `revealIfOpen` with `revealIfOpenInActiveGroup` causes Quick Open to move already-open Editors into the active Editor Group. This allows you to emulate buffer-centric environments—no tabs, split your screen, and you can view any Editor within any Editor Group without opening a file multiple times.

 one thing that's keeping me is that i can't restore open buffers and what i was working on when opening a directory.
 in neovim it is as easy as installing a plugin an then it will work whenever you open neovim inside a directory.
 in doom emacs i found the workspace feature that i liked because it creates a new workspace whenever i use "projectile switch" but when i kill emacs all i find left is the last workspace (i don't know if i am doing anything wrong but i am using SPC TAB . which is like "M-x workspace switch to")
 i believe that i just don't know the keyword to look for my solution (because that's how i descovered Projectile too +\) )
 thanks for any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there. I've been back and forth with emacs and neovim for a long while now, preferring emacs but also kind of getting wrapped around the axel a bit with lisp. But, now as I start to move back to emacs (ORG mode is just too good, and I like some of the TUI abilities elsewhere that emacs gives me) , I'm looking for if there's a generic and good way to set up LSP akin to neovim's "Mason" project, which lets me just select the languages I need and properly set everything up.
 If not, that's cool, but discoverability is still very weird in the editor world. I know how to use package managers and plan on starting a config with elpaca or straight, and then adding on evil and which-key and some doom-themes and doom-modeline, but the whole setup and configuration of various LSPs are where there's a plethora of choice and I'm curious to see how people do it.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I last rewrote my init.el a decade ago, before use-package, and now it's a giant heap of files, often one per added package to init a package, that get loaded in, along with various global settings that are adjusted through setq or function calls and then a custom.el
 And this works, but it takes some time to start emacs up....
 So I was thinking of re-doing this with the new fangled use-package all the kids are doing and was a bit dismayed to find now there are several other package managers, we went from none to plethora.
 At any rate, I was wondering what the best way to lay out an init.el was, especially regarding ordering of things like
  
loading of packages
 loading of custom.el (do I even need to explicitly load custom.el)
 setting of global settings via setq or function call
 key bindings
 other??
  
When I lay it out like this, I think that's a pretty logical way of laying it out, but is it?
 What else should be considered in laying out an init.el to make it survive the decades?

 What I’ve been trying to figure out is how to automatically determine the best ordering of any given set of processes to maximize passive time, so I can free up as much of time as possible while also being more productive. How would you about accomplishing this?
 So far, I’ve got a ‘process.org’ file with a global process tag. I have a list of processes as headers, with properties like ‘TOTAL_TIME’, ‘ACTIVE_TIME’, etc. What makes it challenging is some processes need to occur sequentially and have active time between them or throughout. Like mixing flour and water, waiting, then adding yeast and doing the first fold, waiting, then folding again, waiting, then proofing and preheating oven, waiting, then baking and waiting. 
 What I’d like to be able to do is go through my process.org file and just change the TODO state to ‘NEXT’ then have the cumulative list of all processes for the next morning optimized for me.

 But sometimes there is no method available. Take converting a List to a Queue, there is no toQueue available. You can always do Queue.from and that's fine, but I'm wondering how does the to method works, does anybody have examples or is it just an internal mechanism?
 For instance, I've tried:
 (0 until 5).to(Queue[Int]) (0 until 5).to[Queue[Int]](Queue[Int]) 
 But both seem to be invalid. Any pointers? Just looking for ergonomic ways to do these conversions. One can always foldLeft or use the above-mentioned collection.from but it's less ergonomic.

I've gotten most things to work alright but I am disappointed with the lack of autocompletion options to far. In particular, TeX-electric-escape seems to do a very poor job in my opinion. It seems like predictive-mode is the solution but I am unsure how to install it. All the links on this page https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PredictiveMode#h5o-2 seem dead and I'm unsure how else to access it. I would appreciate any help with this specific problem or advice on a potentially better way to handle autocomplete in latex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question is not emacs-specific, but I have a feeling that this technical crowd might know a path forward given how customizable emacs is.
 My new work role requires me to spend even more time in email. We use Office 365 / Exchange for our work email, so the Outlook desktop client and the webmail interface is my default interface. Often times, I send an email to a recipient, and wait for their response. The chance that they respond is low, so I always have to send a follow up note. Take this and multiply by 100 threads, which takes up a lot of my time to stay on top of things.
 What I would like to do is set up my follow-up email, and have the note sent out on a certain date if I haven't heard back yet. If the person responds before the date, the pre-written note should never be sent and could be discarded. Outlook email rules and delay send feature does not allow for such a complex scenario.
 I am aware of the Boomerang app for Gmail and Outlook, but I don't think the cost is worth it; and I don't think corporate would allow me to install that add-in in Outlook.
 I looked into Thunderbird as it has a "send later" plugin that appears to have a scripting component, which could probably work. However, I'm unable to get my work mail account to work with Thunderbird. I could probably try some more to figure out why it isn't working.
 Question for the folks in this subreddit: is there a way to achieve the email rules I described using an email client in Emacs? Or some other open source tool?
 I know this is a long shot. Thanks in advance for any insight you might provide.

 I'd've expected, since, Emacs traffics in text, there'd've been something in-built but, beyond references to ISO-639-1 for setting the style of fonts (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Fonts.html), I can't seem to find much of anything.
 Plus, any language-related stuff I find (such as the Melpa package Guess Language and https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GuessBufferLanguage) seem to roll their own (scaled down) version rather than relying on anything within Emacs or, even, a third-party library.
 Figured someone here might know of something, if there is anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please help. I have recently upgraded emacs and tried to adopt LSP & treesitter. I'm primarily working in Typescript at the moment so I'm using LSP typescript and tsx-ts-mode. Also using lsp-ui, LSP eslint, flycheck and company-mode.
 The result has become extremely frustrating as I've started to use it beyond trivial use cases. When working quickly, with many files/projects open, the following often happens:
  
make an edit quickly
 no update from language server and any stale errors remain
 tsserver process spins and spins at max CPU for about a minute
 CPU drops and the buffer finally updates... maybe?
  
It can take minutes to respond, and sometimes seems to stall indefinitely. I end up forced to `lsp-restart-server` repeatedly throughout the day. I don't think this is necessarily specifically an LSP issue, but probably some combination of things, like maybe LSP is getting confused and issuing too many requests? I have already gone through all the recommendations in `lsp-doctor` and I'm a little uncertain where to even look to diagnose further (the `*lsp-log*` doesn't contain anything illuminating) and the problem seems to get worse and worse.
 Is this a common experience? How can I see better what's going on? Any packages I should maybe look for and jettison?

But no matter what i do i cannot seem to get error highlighting for html misspelled tags which oher editors do by default. i have installed flymake and all it does is highlights tags that are left open.
 Will Doom Emacs/Spacemacs solve these configuration issues? if yes, which one would be the best? Also, is there any way to kep my current .emacs file and vanilla emacs installation without having it detected by Doom/Spacemacs?

 treesit
 When I started I was using the built-in treesit package, however I quickly realized the highlighting was fairly subpar even when the font-lock was at level 4. I looked at the doom source code and saw that they were using the old 3rd party tree-sitter package.
 tree-sitter
 Using this package seems to bring a lot more options into scope and it immediately made the highlighting better. However, I am still having trouble making it look as good as doom's highlighting (particularly in python files).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've recently written an article about stuff I'd love to see Haskell do as a user of the language. I've been using Haskell for over 15 years now, and I believe at least some of those things would make Haskell a better language to work in. I was wondering what everyone else would love to see in Haskell - informally, without the restraints of a fully formal enhancement proposal. Shoot your ideas in the replies, I'd love to hear it. Also, let me know what you think of the article. Bear in mind this is the first such article I've written in maybe 12 years, so maybe don't rip into it too much :) It's all meant to be a little informal and inspirational rather than a fully prescriptive solution to every problem.

 I use eglot with clangd which I configure as follows:
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '((c-ts-mode c++-ts-mode c-mode c++-mode) . ("clangd" "-j=8" "--log=error" "--malloc-trim" "--background-index" "--clang-tidy" "--all-scopes-completion" "--completion-style=detailed" "--pch-storage=memory" "--header-insertion=never" "--header-insertion-decorators=0")))) 
 Recently I have to work inside some docker containers that use different toolchains, things mostly work on Emacs 29 native support for docker in Tramp, except that I now need to pass the --query-driver option to clangd to effectively index my project, somehting like this:
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '((c-ts-mode c++-ts-mode c-mode c++-mode) . ("clangd" "-j=8" "--query-driver=/path/to/gcc,/path/to/g++" "--log=error" "--malloc-trim" "--background-index" "--clang-tidy" "--all-scopes-completion" "--completion-style=detailed" "--pch-storage=memory" "--header-insertion=never" "--header-insertion-decorators=0")))) 
 Is there a way to set eglot-server-programs per project? Maybe as dir-local variable?

 I'd like the cursor to move as predictably as possible when I scroll. I want it to get back to the original position when I scroll up and down back and forth a few screens.
  
 There are a couple of issues with the scroll up and down functions. First, the beginning and the end of buffer are an edge case. But I can work with that. The scroll-up-command and scroll-down-command work better for me than scroll-up and scroll-down. I can write a wrapper that remembers the last good position and jumps there when I move in the opposite direction from the beginning or end.

I'm probably just missing some binding command or something, but I can't figure out what.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During experimenting with loom-based development, I wanted a rust like ?- Operator. 
 The implementation turned out to be a little bit tricky, but here it is: https://github.com/reactivecore/quest
 The tricky part is correct return type deduction, consider this:
 ```scala def operation(): Option[Int] = ???
 val result = quest { operation().? Some(12) } `` The result will beOption[Int]. If it would just look at the inner functon ofquestit would deductSome[Int]`. 
 This works using a special trait called Resulting[T] which is triggered by quest being a context function. 
 Resulting is also referenced by the question operator, thus the compiler is inferencing T to be None and Some[Int] resulting in Option[Int].
 The library triggers an early exit using Exceptions without Stacktraces. Measurements show, that this creates an overhead of ~5ns, which should be acceptable.
 Of course it won't work (and being dangerous) in lazy evaluated code (Futures, Lazy Collections, Effect Systems etc.).
 What do you think?
 Disclaimer: The base idea was already presented by Martin Odersky at Scalar Conference 2023 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fm0y4K4YO8 (which I rembered later in implementation)
 There is also an old thread.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for that difficult title, if it didn't give you a stroke, I'll give you an example of what I mean.
 So for instance, the command calendar normally reuses the current frame/window. However, with the variable calendar-setup set to two-frames, it creates two new frames, one for the calendar and one for the diary.
 This isn't the only command like this, it's just an example, and it's not even the only one I might like to solve, since I face a similar problems with some gnus workflows I want to build, so please, no specific hacks to get this particular thing to work such as suggesting I not use calendar-setup set to two-frames, I really need a generalisable solution to this.
 So the issue is, if I launch emacsclient -e '(calendar)' from a shortcut or the command-line in order to bring up my calendar, this doesn't work unless there is a pre-existing emacsclient frame.
 The solution then would seem to be to issue either emacsclient -c -e '(calendar)' or emacsclient -r -e '(calendar)' in order to create a frame first.
 The problem is this creates a totally useless frame that is both annoying, but also problematic, because you can't close it if the calendar and diary frames aren't already closed.
 What I'd like is to be able to run (calendar) and have it create its frames without the need for a pre-existing frame. Or else in a really bad pinch, have the dummy frame created but totally hidden, and have it quit the moment I close the diary and calendar frames.
 Does anybody have any ideas? I've been pulling my hair out here, I dunno if I'm missing something obvious.

 My last real attempt at an Emacs package was El Gantt which generates gantt charts from orgmode files. I written a couple other buggy things (e.g., https://github.com/legalnonsense/org-visual-outline). I am a lawyer and Emacs helps keep me sane at work. Elisp is the only language I know and only one ever want to know. 
 For the last couple years I have worked on something new. I have been using it for awhile now and think it is good enough to share: https://github.com/legalnonsense/reorg. 
 It is like taxy.el, org-ql, org-sidebar except that it’s not limited to org files and it’s messier shotgun of ideas. 
 It allows clones of outline nodes as featured in Leo Editor. This also means it can at least give the appearance of real transclusion. 
 I’ve written a readme that explains everything in a way that I hope makes sense.
 I make no guarantee that you can clone and run this error free.

 Especially in rust files, it shows a small arrow opposite the line where there is an error however the error itself (message) shows only when I move my cursor to this line. Or maybe its not even lsp, maybe this is flycheck?

 Okay, so I have this problem where I always had a few hundred buffers open in ibuffer, and I couldn’t figure out what was doing it - since YEARS. Well, I finally figured it out the other day! Org refiling was the culprit. See, I didn’t know this but whenever you refile, when it says getting all targets, it’s opening them up (at least it did in my ibuffer behind the scenes).
 To counter this, I asked an AI to help me, and it did. It wrote the code but it couldn’t get the last part right about not opening ibuffer to kill everything. I fixed that up myself. So this is a collaboration between an AI and me, but the code works.
 The only “issue” now is that if you have a lot of targets, it will take a few seconds each time to do the gathering part. For me, that’s not a big deal, …]]></summary>

 I worked past 6 months with different stack (JS/TS), and now got a chance to do little Scala 3 again. It's so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes. Really, it does.
 Small things you easily forget, and notice when they are gone (just to mention few): syntax ergonomics, pattern matching, compiler & macros working for you, powerful std library and amazing ecosystem of libraries that make Scala also practical to build real projects with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[org-mode defines a serious number of keys in org-mode-map, some of which I want to use for my own nefarious purposes. There's org-disputed-keys which is supposed to stop org-mode from squatting on them. The trouble is, it doesn't always seem to work.
 For example, I want to use C-M-<left/right/up/down> globally to move the point to the window in those directions (with windmove) and I want to use C-M-S-<left/right/up/down> globally to move the window itself in those directions (using my own defun).
 org-mode squats on those shifted C-M-S- keys, and you would think that this would fix it:
 (setq org-replace-disputed-keys t) ;; restart emacs after changing any of these: (setq org-disputed-keys '(([(kbd "C-M-S-<right>")] . [( nil )]) ([(kbd "C-M-S-<left>")] . [( nil )]) ([(kbd "C-M-S-<up>")] . [( nil )]) ([(kbd "C-M-S-<down>")] . [( nil )]) <plus many other keys that I want to use and for which org-disputed-keys works fine eg> ([(kbd "C-,")] . [( nil )]) 
 This works fine on other keys that org-mode would otherwise occupy, such as C-' but not on C-M-S-<left/right> so I have to resort (in org-mode-hook) to a heavy-handed:
 (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-M-S-<left>") nil) (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-M-S-<right>") nil) 
 Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? Or is it a bug in org-mode?
 I don't use org-mode very much (mainly for elfeed-dashboard) preferring the much simpler outline-minor-mode (plus a few hacks) but I do want org-mode buffers/windows to behave themselves with my window moving global keys.

 However, I get tons of linker errors with ghc libraries like requires unsupported dynamic reloc, recompile with -fPIC
 Now, -fPIC is required to link all that statically into one shared lib. How can I make stack build (re-build?) entire GHC runtime with -fPIC?

 I have a server that I access through ssh, open emacs in the terminal and use it. very happy so far,
 but I do want to test to use my local emacs GUI and make the same things. open files, run process there, etc. 
 I tested to open tramp like `/ssh:matt@192.168.1.10:/home/matt/code/` and it open the dir, but I can't for example seek project files. Also I use devenv (nix) to load the needed tools, but even if I open vterm and execute it, the main process doesn't have it. so I can't run things like tests. 
 Is there other way to use it ? or any tutorial in how to configure?

 Thanks in advance!

 val res:Either[Exception,List[Path]] = for { path1:Path <- ListT(foo1()) path2:Path <- ListT(foo2(path1)) path3:Path <- ListT(foo3(path)) } yield path3 
 I've found https://typelevel.org/cats/faq.html#where-is-listt but when I try to use Nested in my for-comprehension. I get compile failures.
  
value flatMap is not a member of cats.data.Nested[[B] =>> Either[Exception, B], List, java.nio.file.Path]
  
I've tried adding cats syntax imports to no success. I'm fairly certain this monadic transform style should be doable for a basic collection. Any help or guidance is appreciated. Thank you!!
 EDIT: I wrote this code to hold the spot, until better code comes. For now this may be useful to others. I took advantage of the fact I'm only using Either[Exception,List[_]]. The example code basically runs as it. Maybe someone somewhere finds this useful too!
 import scala.annotation.tailrec class ListT[A](val run:Either[Exception,List[A]]) { def flatMap[B](func:A=>ListT[B]):ListT[B]= run match { case Right(list) => @tailrec def churn(remainder:List[A])(accum:List[B]):ListT[B]= remainder match { case Nil => ListT(Right(accum)) case head::tail => val intermediate = func(head) intermediate.run match { case l:Left[Exception,List[B]] => intermediate case Right(list) => churn(tail)(list++accum) } } churn(list)(Nil) case l:Left[Exception,_] => this.asInstanceOf[ListT[B]] } def map[B](func:A=>B):ListT[B]= run match { case l:Left[Exception,List[A]] => l.asInstanceOf[ListT[B]] case Right(list) => ListT(Right(list.map(func))) } }

This means finding out what features are available in the language itself and in the libraries.
 And this made me realize how lucky I am to work with Haskell! Aside from how featureful the language itself is, I'm baffled by how many languages have abysmal documentation on the standard library. At least the statically typed ones almost always tell you the types of argument and return value… Quite often, I need to experiment in the REPL to understand what exactly some function or method does.
 This is in stark contrast with Haskell, where I I'm used to read the documentation and have every function explained in detail.
 I also find myself reinventing the wheel a lot less with Haskell. Modules like Data.List or Data.Text provide a wider selection of commonly needed operations that almost any other language I tried!

 Loading data into widgets and saving widget data to a file 
 # Background
 Hi team,
 I'm looking to create a handy little tool for some specific tabletop RPG games (DND-like, Call of Cthulu, Deadlands) and I would like to know if anyone has any ideas for how to get data from a markdown language (such as a .yaml file) into a widget screen and then save from the widget screen back into the file again. 
 My current idea is that I could use an emacs form after running a program to parse the data from the .yaml file, but that eliminates my ability to use the fun widget library in emacs (which has the nice features of checkboxes and buttons). So I would like to be able to have my widget 'UI', and load the data from the yaml file interactively, so that I can save back to it as well.
 I've been trying to find the source code for the customize buffer in emacs, which does essentially what I want to do, but my grepping has been to no avail.

 I've seen about half a dozen pages explain this in various ways, but none are very easy to set up, and they don't get too much into specifics about whether it is two-way syncing (which is what I wish for) or not.
 In short: Does anyone have a solution that is fairly easy to set up?
 EDIT: I have tried org-caldav with my NextCloud setup, but it's not working entirely correctly and I'm not certain why. It syncs from the calendar on the server, but not to it. Also, NextCloud appears to be a bit buggy at times as I found it difficult to delete the test calendars at times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an init.el pretty much unchanged since 2010 or so. So I've declared emacs init bankruptcy and am starting over.
 I've installed the latest stable version of emacs (29.2) and am using an init.el generated by https://emacs.amodernist.com/
 I am not sure this is the latest and greatest kind of init, I notice it does not use any use-package
 One big change between then and now is the introduction of the nongnu repository and I see that it's automatically listed in the package-archives of emacs 29.2.
 What's it state?
 Do I need melpa at all?
 If I do need melpa for packages not yet in gnu or nongnu, how do I add melpa in so that it's priority is last on the list?
 Right now I have:
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t) (setq package-archive-priorities '((gnu . 10) (nongnu . 5) (melpa . 1))) 
 But even so, when I m-x list-packages I can see that emacs wants to upgrade the nongnu packages to the ones in melpa.
 As an example
 the version of the avy package in melpa is 20230420.404
 but in nongnu the version is 0.5.0
  
When installing packages, the package with the highest version number from the archive with the highest priority is selected. When higher versions are available from archives with lower priorities, the user has to select those manually.
 Archives not in this list have the priority 0, as have packages that are already installed. If you use negative priorities for the archives, they will not be upgraded automatically.
  
Since the version numbers of nongnu and melpa differ so widely, it seems as if there is no way to just set package archive priority such that it will default to nongnu
 Any advice?
 Suggestions on using melpa or not?
 Suggestions if using melpa how to get it to be used only when packages are not found in gnu or nongnu?

 But on new linux distros you can't install tinytag via pip and your system python package. You have to install it into a virtual environment. 
 My question is, on new linux distros how do I set emms to use tinytag as installed in a python virtual environment? Do I activate the virtual environment and then set emms-info-tinytag-python-name to the path of python in the virtual environment?
 Thanks for any help.

 One of the most important topics in IT is surely the security, it's so complicated and intriguing that, either you love it or you hate it, but we can't help taking care of it. Nowadays, in a society based on computers and applications, crackers attacks are very concrete and dangerous. In my opinion, when we talk about IT security, it is always better to overestimate the risk and have a large margin of tolerance. The (hard) trade-off we have to make is that the solution is usable, has good performance, and is safe.
  
Often, it is not a single solution that makes something safe; it is the sum of several approaches that mitigate the risk.

 It has been a while since I had my first idea for a library that would help developers securely manage secret values within their app…]]></summary>

 Here is an example of what I mean:
 | col1 | col2 | col3 | col4 | | test | 1 | | | | test2 | 5 | -4 | 6 | | test3 | 4 | 1 | 9 | #+TBLFM: @3$3..@>$3=@-1$2-@0$2::@3$4..@>$4=@-1$2+@0$2 
 In col3 I show the result of subtracting the value in col2 in the current row from the value col2 in the previous row. col4 does the same with adding the rows
 But what if I wanted to have two table. One for the input data (col1, col2) and one for the calculated data (col3, col4)
 I tried it like this
 #+TBLNAME: data | col1 | col2 | | test | 1 | | test2 | 5 | | test3 | 4 | | col3 | col4 | | | | | -4 | 6 | | 1 | 9 | #+TBLFM: @3$1..@>$1=remote(data,@-1$2)-remote(data,@0$2)::@3$2..@>$2=remote(data,@-1$2+@0$2) 
 But it throws an error that "Row descriptor -1 leads outside table". Obviously because the relative positions are not based on the second table

 So I had this interview with this big company where the interviewer was quite experienced.

Now the role for which they were hiring was Full Stack Dev, however this dude started with problem solving. 
 He asked me first which language would like to pick, so I told him that I would prefer using JavaScript/C++ and then he responded oh don't you know Java? Look I don't hate Java …]]></summary>

modify my export to markdown, generate the appropriate sidebar file and setup docsify in the normal way. My primary objection is the markdown exporter's quality is unknown. This would also cut my publish time down significantly and wouldn't be too much work.
 index the HTML (Note: getting this only do the relevant piece was difficult the last time I tried as tags and metadata blew up the results) as part of the publishing process and add a Javascript library that gets included in every exported HTML file. We'll call this the stork model. While slightly slower than the previous option, this would also reduce publishing time substantially.
  
What other solutions occur to you?
 edit: I ended up doing the first one. It took a couple of hours to convert.

 Are there any emacs packages that include commands for taking the text in the active region and switching between bold, italic, etc using unicode substitutions? 
 ie like these kinds of text generators.

 I realize such a generator can't handle every character, but I want it just for highlighting words in comments, etc. 
 Tnx!

 Is there really no way to copy/paste - share data with other apps? For simple things - like cope a website's URL in Firefox and paste it to a document in Emacs?

 But what about lines without soft newline characters? When I open mails in mu4e, all longer lines are nicely wrapped. The lines though that can be shown completely in the buffer stick out and are not wrapped, and this looks ugly and makes reading harder because of the long lines. (See the attached screenshot. The lines at the end are much longer than the wrapped ones above.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have set up a simple server with scala+cask (I have set the port to 51934 and the host to be "0.0.0.0"). I was getting connection timeouts when I was trying to connect from a different PC in the local network and when I ran netstat -an | grep LISTEN I got the following output:
 ​
 tcp 0 0 127.0.0.53:530.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:6310.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:220.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:54320.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::51934 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:8212:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:45459:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:44569:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:35383:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::22 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::5432 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 ::1:631 :::* LISTEN
 ​
 Now, the third entry on that output is my ssh server which is accessible from everywhere. The first tcp6 entry is the server I am trying to set up now. I see it being listed as tcp6. So I guess I have two questions:
 - Is this an issue (that is my guess)
 - How can I configure the cask server so that it uses tcp instead of tcp6?

If dir-a and dir-b are far away from each other, this may take a lot of keystrokes.
 This could be made easier, if insert-file would allow me to jump to a bookmarked directory (which might be closer to dir-b). Do you know any such solution ?
 Please note, that in this special use-case (insert-file), the command bookmark-bmenu-list (or similar) does not provide an alternative as far as I can see.

They both support deconstructing ideas in a tree structure, except that mindmaps offer a spatial way of arranging items, while the outliner does it as a list. I like to mindmap first and then turn it into an outline.
 I figured out a dead simple way of doing it that doesn't involve messing around with freeplane plugins that export to Org-mode. (I tried one, it didn't work for me.) The One Downside - It only works with the nodes, not it's properties like attributes and notes.
 Step 1
  
Open Freeplane, go to Format > Manage Styles > Edit Styles (Or just hit C+f11).
 On the branch called Automatic level styles, select the top level node
 On the right side pane are the controls. Scroll down to Core Text and in the field called Format add this: * %…]]></summary>

 I'm new to programming and am learning Python!
 I decided to go with Emacs, and you might be asking why. Well, I've dabbled a bit with Emacs in the past, and I'm intrigued by its feature set, which I believe could greatly enhance my programming-fu. I'm using Termux with an external keyboard because I do not have access to a computer. Is my approach off-base? Is there a significant difference between using emacs vs emacs -nw ? Can I just stick to the vanilla setup for programming in Python?
 Your insights are greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

Being a newbie, I thought "great, lets clear those out" and I followed the instructions to delete them. On restarting this morning, I realised that the deleted packages were my Modus-themes, Golden-ratio and pdf-tools (with other pdf related files), all of which are loaded every time I start emacs and essential to my newbie workflow.
 Does emacs have a habit of suggesting that you delete files that are actually used and setup in your init.el? ..or more likely, what am I doing wrong that emacs suggested that I delete them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this question has been asked before, I want to learn Haskell and I have very little programming experience(only Python & some robotics C) and I'm conflicted at the moment.
 My roadmap is:
  
HFTVB by John Whitington or the Haskell Wikibook
 Write yourself a Scheme tutorials
 Learn Haskell by Building a Blog Generator by Gilmi.
  
Is it worth buying on HFTVB? Or is the Wikibook good enough? Or more importantly, am I being redundant since all of the above are focused on beginners? As in, would it be better to just jump into LHBG?
 By looking at the options above, you'll notice that I have:
  
A preference for text over video courses.
 A phobia from large books which I see recommended on here. I like things succinct where the questions lead me to discover more of the material and where I am left with space to figure things out for myself.
  
I know at this point this is quite a repetitive question, but I'm really interested in starting as soon as possible and would like not to go through the phase of trying out a 1000 unrelated things until I figure out which is right for me, I know my preferences and prefer sticking to them.
 I also read about LYAH, and while it seems quaint the no exercises disqualifies it immediately from the race. I like my resources jam-packed with exercises.

Get all the files called "file_contexts" found. For that I could use consult-find, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR - How do I incorporate backlink searches into my org-ql queries?
 ​
 I am re-structuring my notes to adapt to new demands. I really like the non-hierarchical approach where individual notes are org-mode headers (or files) with an ID property that I can simply link to.
 Org-ql is fantastic at querying org-mode headers, keeping dynamic blocks based on those queries, etc. Using org-ql, I can also query for links within a heading. What I am missing is the option to query for backlinks TO the heading. Has anyone solved this problem?
 ​
 Simple example:
 * Drug A :drug: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 12345 :END: This is an inhibitor of [[id:54321][Protein X]]. * Protein X :protein: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 54321 :END: This is a trans-membrane protein that is over-expressed in breast cancer. 
 If I'm interested in the a subset of inhibitor drugs that are linked to Protein X I can do:
 [[org-ql-search:(and (rifle "inhibitor") (link "Protein X"))]] 
 But what about finding trans-membrane proteins are associated with (i.e. "backlinked to") inhibitors?
 ​
 OR - maybe there is a way to use org-ql results as org-ql query inputs? For example: 
  
Query 1: pull out all drugs.
 Query 2: pull out all proteins.
 Query 3: identify all proteins (from Query 2) that have a backlink to drugs (from Query 1).
  
​
 I'm a bit stuck. Any help or pointers would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a short Haskell book several years ago and every 6 months or so I like to update the stack resolver version for the example programs.
 I noticed that a VSCode Haskell plugin expects a GHCup setup. I am thinking of forking my own code and experimenting with just using Cabal and GHCup installed tools, and also get rid of my stack.yml files in each project directory.
 A few years ago it seemed that stack removed many of the pain points I had with Haskell but now I am re-evaluating that belief.
 Any advice will be appreciated!!

 Release notes:
  
After an upgrade from an earlier version of Stack, on first use only, Stack 2.15.1 may warn that it had trouble loading the CompilerPaths cache.
 The hash used as a key for Stack's pre-compiled package cache has changed, following the dropping of support for Cabal versions older than 1.24.0.0.
  
Changes since v2.13.1:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack does not leave *.hi or *.o files in the setup-exe-src directory of the Stack root, and deletes any corresponding to a setup-<hash>.hs or setup-shim-<hash>.hs file, to avoid GHC issue #21250.
 If Stack's Nix integration is not enabled, Stack will notify the user if a nix executable is on the PATH. This usually indicates the Nix package manager is available. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tldr; Looking for packages for customizing dired listings.
 Howdy. I've recently gotten an "Emacs splinter" about the format of dired directory listings and after playing with dired-listing-switches I've determined there are not enough knobs there to allow me to filter out some of the stuff I want to filter out. I see that I can write some custom filters also which might take me where I want to go but my elisp skills are still somewhat meager and I have quite a lot on my plate already.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for elisp packages already in the ecosystem which might be a quick win here? More so to filter the contents of the listings and not so much, for example, colors (ex:diredfl).
 thx!

 That doesn't show a useful hint in the which-key-pop-up.
 The use-package doc says that is uses the function (bind-key) so something like this should work, but actually doesn't:
 (use-package emacs :bind (("C-c C-k" . ("backward-kill-line" . (lambda () (interactive) (kill-line 0))))) 
 Am I just missing some syntactical finesse or is what I want not possible with use-package's :bind?

 I would like to dabble in org-brain aside from org-roam. Unfortunately the documentation is pretty thin and there are no instructions what I need to do in order to adapt it to Doom emacs. Org-brain is a flag in the doom config file, but I am pretty sure I need to set it up as well. 
 Can someone aid me in doing it? I am sure some of have done it or at least know what I need to do for adapting packages. I heard you shouldn't install as if it was vanilla emacs, but I only starting to understand what that means. 
 Thanks for your help

It is inspired by https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-project, a package for creating Common Lisp projects interactively. Similarly, a directory called skelton is provided, which acts as a template for the project. This makes the setup easy to understand. I used to search how to create an Emacs Lisp project every time I created one, but since I created this one, I don't need to do that anymore. I announced this package to the Emacs community in my country, and it was so well received that I am announcing it here on Reddit as well. I hope you will Star it if you like!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the other day I spent more than 3 seconds renaming eat buffers, so I decided to spend more than 3 days to make my own package that does it automatically. After finishing, I found that if you launch eat with a prefix argument it does exactly what I wanted.
 Nevertheless, this package has more features (like updating the indexes when a buffer is closed & more formatting options) and not only it works for eat, but for everything that when launched checks if the buffer already exists and uses that instead of creating a new one (I only tested vterm and eat) so it can be used as a simple replacement to multi-vterm and multi-term.
 I really recommend the experience. I've been using emacs for about a year, and even though you do learn by making your config, making a package gives you a waaay higher level of understanding, even if it's a basic one like mine.
 I tried to make the best code I could, but I'm no elisp/lisp programmer, but a C one, so probably the style isn't exactly right. There are a few features I didn't add yet and it could be way better documented.
 Here's the link for anyone interested: https://gitlab.com/vslavkin/multi-buffer.el
 Edit: not sure if the name is good or not, please tell me if you have a better alternative

 I'm still using Emacs-w32 from Cygwin and I start it elevated:
 cygstart --action=runas run emacs-w32 
 so I can edit "privileged" files.
 I wonder if WSL's Emacs could be a "system" tool - could I ditch Cygwin completely (having X Server backported by Microsoft to Win 10)...
 It could be frustrating to switch text editor just to edit hosts file...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I am learning haskell from this resource: https://learn-haskell.blog/04-markup/04-parsing_02.html
 and I cannot understand certain function call, I mean this one:
 maybe id (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) 
 from this block:
  parse :: String -> Document parse = parseLines Nothing . lines -- (1) parseLines :: Maybe Structure -> [String] -> Document parseLines context txts = case txts of [] -> maybeToList context -- (2) -- Paragraph case currentLine : rest -> let line = trim currentLine in if line == "" then maybe id (:) context (parseLines Nothing rest) -- (3) else case context of Just (Paragraph paragraph) -> parseLines (Just (Paragraph (unwords [paragraph, line]))) rest -- (4) _ -> maybe id (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) trim :: String -> String trim = unwords . words 
 especially this part:
 (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) 
 Let's say we call this function with context = Nothing and txts = ["abc", ""]
 so firstly we go to this case:
 maybe id (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) 
 and now is the part I don't understand, (:) context in this case is (Nothing : any list that parseLines will return) so Nothing will be prepend to a list of paragraphs, but when Im calling this function in ghci it just returns [Paragraph "abc"] without nothing, but manually calling (Nothing: [Just $ Paragraph "abc"]) returns a list with Nothing at the beginning. 
 Can someone explain this, please?

 INTERPRETER="$(nix-build '<nixpkgs>' --no-out-link -A pkgs.glibc)/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2"
 patchelf --set-interpreter "${INTERPRETER}" "${BINARY}" ```
 But then when I run it inside a directory with a Nix Shell invonment, the Nix Shell environment is not passed to the executable so the program fails to start.

 Despite I am on the nix-unstable channel, due to a bug I was surprised to find packages are a bit old, and were last generated 3 months ago. Things are quite behind ELPA or MELPA Stable, especially taking into consideration this is an unstable channel.
 Do you use Nix or NixOS? If so, how do you manage your own Emacs?

 The problem is as follows: I have everything set up and it runs perfectly well. I can download messages, read them, archive/delete them, etc... This is all reflected in Apple Mail in iOS and on the Mac as well. However, the Sent Mail doesn't seem to sync in the same way. If I send an email with Mu4e, it will save it to the designated "icloud/Sent Messages" locally, and I can see it in mu4e. But I can't see it in Apple Mail at all. It's simply not synced. All the other folders are except for this one. Also, Sent items from Apple Mail do not sync to mu4e either.
 Is there something that I'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the first packages I setup in emacs when I began using it were projectile and perspective. I primarily use emacs as an IDE and wanted to be able to manage different projects. Google said these were good so I started there. Two months on and I still don't have a single perspective set and projectile feels like I'm using a semi truck to tow a hand cart. I've only not removed projectile because it integrates with tree-macs and I'm hoping to set it up so that I can have tree-macs display my list of folders when I'm not working on a project and only the project root of the current working directory when I'm in a python/c++ project. Tree-macs has a variable that allows you to set it to display a single directory and I'm wondering if that can be done with a .dir-local.el file, eliminating the one thing I think would make projectile worth having. I'd also like to exclude folders with .gitignore but again, I wonder if there is a way to do that with tree-macs or project.el.
 So, my question. What do you guys use perspective and projectile for. As a hobby programmer, do you think it's worth having? What are your thoughts on project.el and what else is out there?

        <link href="https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2827/example-of-topic-vs-object-tags-to-make-more-sense-of-tagging-practices"/>
        <updated>2024-02-09T18:30:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I shared this on my blog earlier this week:
https://christiantietze.de/posts/2024/02/example-object-tag-vs-topic-tag-programming-zettelkasten/
So I talked with a fellow iOS developer about tagging recently, then overhauled a note I found by accident and shared this as an example.
The gist is:
I increased specificity of tags. The general #image  becomes → #uiimage on iOS, #nsimage on macOS, which are actual types in the macOS API.
I removed the topic tag #appkit which doesn't tell me anything interesting here.
Why is the object tag #appkit useless now? Almost all my programming notes are about macOS and thus #appkit, the macOS UI API framework. So it doesn't help find anything, and it'd produce so many notes that it becomes useless. Thousands, if applied consistently!
There are notes about the AppKit framework as a topic. These stay put, of course!
The thing is: for my very first notes on programmatic image manipulation, it sounded sensible to use a tag like #image.  After all, I did not expect to need specificity here at all: "something with image in Appkit" sounded good. But with expertise, I need NSImage-related resources, and I can name contexts better. Like embedding images in text views, as wirh The Archive 
All notes are malleable, so no problem.
By the way, new notes on similar topics I tag with the very specific API titles right away, e.g. #nsimage for image stuff on Mac. This changed in the past couple of years and I don't have to think about this, at all. I believe it felt similar back when I used the """bad""" tag. So chances are I could discover even more specific tags in the future and find the current one lacking   At the moment, it's the best topic tag I know to describe this.]]></summary>

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
I am exploring the idea of when my body is in motion and when it is at rest, it interacts with inertia.
How do I modify the format of my wikilinks to something more generic? I feel for @ZettelDistraction's pain, and he modified his file names and the links in his ZK. Just the thought of attempting this hurts my little brain.
I'm thinking about adulting my Monk Mornings.
I use my ZK in support of my university literature and writing coursework.
Things I'm reading:
Quintero, Isabel. Gabi, a girl in pieces. 2014.
Picard, Max. The world of silence. 1948.
Gardner, Dwight. UPSTAIRS DELICATESSEN: on eating, reading, reading about eating, and eating while reading. 2024.
Yoon, Nicola. The sun is also a star. 2016.
Music I'm listening to:
Schiller
Kaleo
Hania Rani
A look at my ZK work themes:
1/19 zettel - meta zettelkasting
★★★★★
The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

 When I try to use them though, I get an error: "all-the-icons isn't installed"
 Now, I know all-the-icons isn't installed. The reason is because it was apparently taken out of Doom Emacs in favor of "nerd-icons" which I had to install instead when first setting up Doom. But from this error message, I'm gathering that Neotree needs, or at least is specifically looking for, all-the-icons.
 Is there a way to tell Neotree to use the icons from the font I have installed? It just won't even turn on at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently setting up my capture templates and want to do the following.
  
Create a file if it doesn't exist yet
 Give it a level 1 heading of the current date
 Give it two level 2 headings "Journal" and "activities"
 Have one capture template that creates entries under "Journal" and another one that creates entries uner "activities"
  
I have 1 - 3 implemented and everything works so far. My problem is 4. My capture template for "Journal" looks like this:
 ("ja" "Journal" entry
 (file+olp (lambda()(rmz/create-org-file)) (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d") "Journal")
 "* %<%H:%M %p> - %?")
 So the first thing in the target is a call to a function that creates the file if it doesn't exist and then returns the file name (works). Then I want to create the olp. The level 1 heading needs to be created dynamically while the second ("journal") is static. This is what the documentation says about it:
 (file+olp "path/to/file" "Level 1 heading" "Level 2" ...)
 For non-unique headings, the full outline path is safer
 If I only add "Journal" as olp in the target emacs throws the error "Heading not found on level 1: Journal" (Sounds different in the documentation)
 If I pass the call to format-time-string emacs throws this error "Wrong type argument: stringp, (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")
 Any ideas how I can pass a dynamic heading in the targets olp?

I know how to use space-mark in combination with whitespace-display-mapping to convert ALL spaces to a dot, but in all honesty, that isn't really helpful. I would rather like to be able to call out spaces that appear before tabs, and also spaces that appear after tabs.
 If I simply use space-before-tab and space-after-tab, without space-mark, I am able to see these spaces because they have a different background color (I modified my theme)... but that all goes away when my cursor goes to the line where these spaces are (I have global-hl-line-mode on). I'd like to have these spaces still be visible in this case, preferably with a space-mark. Is this achievable?

 Realistically nobody needs doctor, tetris, several git interfaces, etc. If they do, they can always install them, which is ultimately what it is all about; to pick and choose and build your own environment. It should come bundled with the bare minimum and allow users to pick and choose which packages they want and need IMO.

if "mandatory" fields are present.
 condition fields are present if the condition is true. eg If field A's value = 1, then field B should exist
  
and If these checks fail I need to return a comma seperated list of the fields which are causing the failure.
 And if the checks pass, I need to read this object into a type. 
 Anyone here worked on similar usecases, please shed some light. 
 Also I have been considering using json schema for this, Is there any library to which I can input a json schema file and get the json object validated using the schema?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did an "update all" from melpa today and one or more upgrades breaks a lot of functionality for me. It broke things both on emacs 29 running on manjaro i3 and on emacs 28 running in pop os so it doesn't seem a version related issue. The first thing I noticed, for instance, is that which-key stopped working, despite "which-key" not being one of the packages upgraded. Is there a way to narrow down the culprit?
 This was the list of packages to upgrade:
 (auctex-14.0.0 company-20240208.1943 doom-modeline-20240205.139 flycheck-20240208.2142 helm-descbinds-20240206.802 magit-20240206.2256 mastodon-20240201.1500 org-noter-20240207.2329 org-ref-20240208.1801 transient-20240201.1100 visual-fill-column-20240205.1505).
 Is there a way to upgrade each one in turn and see which one is interfering with the others? For some reason I'm confused how to just upgrade one package in melpa at a time. It only seems possible to install a newer version over an older.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming from an OOP background, I'm finding it difficult to write elisp, for Emacs. I've tried looking for guides, but I haven't found information on how to structure the code of a coherent package.
 Particularly, it's been hard for me to keep track of the code in my mind because I'm using mostly plain functions and not many data structures. And the code is so far in one big file, which I don't know how to split up, as opposed to classes, which are more conceptually modular. How should I make my code more modular? How should I decide when I need to make a new function?
 If I need to visit and insert text into a buffer, should the visit and insert be done at the lowest, i.e. most nested, level possible? Or should I wrap the whole function body in a with-current-buffer?
 If I find myself needing to store a lot of data in variables, am I doing it wrong? I'm not using setq, because it seems like overkill and ugly being global, but even with let and let*, keeping track of what variables have been declared and their scope is getting difficult.
 Should I not declare as many variables and instead make monolithic functions where variable's aren't assigned, rather you just evaluate an expression (xyz) inside the expression you would pass the variable to, i.e. (abc (xyz)) instead of (setq var (xyz)) then (abc var)? I feel like this gets hard to read once you have a lot of nested expressions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been messing with this problem for a while now, off and on for months, really, and it's driving me a little bit crazy, so here we are.
 The specific thing I'm trying to do is exit insert mode (modal editing, previously evil, currently trying meow) when I arrive back in the main org mode file after editing a src block. I'm not actually sure why I end up in insert mode sometimes when exiting src edit, but it happens often. Advising `org-edit-src-exit` is the place to be for this as far as I can tell, and that works when returning to the main org file.
 The problem I have is that editing a src block without calling `org-edit-special`, thus staying in the main org file, will also trigger the advice. Pressing RET, or using anything that makes a new line in the src block (like `meow-insert-above/below`) will call `org-edit-src-exit` and its advice, and I can't find any way to tell in the context of that advice whether the edit is happening in a special edit buffer or not. I'm guessing that editing src blocks without calling `org-edit-special` happens in a background buffer anyway so the process is indistinguishable?
 I've tried checking the major-mode before exiting the edit buffer, but it's always org-mode. I've tried using `org-in-src-block-p`, `org-src-edit-buffer-p`, checking `org-src-mode`, setting a local variable after `org-edit-special` that I can check in my advice, so many things that haven't worked.
 It's very possible that I'm missing something obvious, or there's a very different solution to my specific problem, but even if so, I'm still curious about how to distinguish these src block editing situations. Anybody have any ideas?

 I am doing sorting related exercises on CSES and getting stuck at this problem, https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1619/ 
 Here is my code so far
 ``` import Data.List (sort) import Data.Set qualified as S import Data.ByteString.Char8 qualified as B import Data.ByteString (ByteString) import Debug.Trace
 readPair :: ByteString -> (Int, Int) readPair s = let Just (a, s1) = B.readInt s Just (b, _) = B.readInt $ B.tail s1 in (a, b)
 main :: IO () main = do _ <- B.getLine xs <- pure . sort . map readPair . B.lines =<< B.getContents print $ solve xs
 solve :: [(Int, Int)] -> Int solve xs = fst $ foldl step (0, S.empty) xs where step (m, bs) (a', b') = case S.lookupGT a' bs of Nothing -> (max m 1, S.singleton b') Just gt -> let i = S.findIndex gt bs (_, gts) = S.splitAt i bs in (max m (S.size gts + 1), S.insert b' gts) ```
 Without sorting after map readPair, this code takes 0.1s to run the largest test case and passes the time constraint of 1s. With sorting present, it cannot satisfy the time constraint. I tried using Seq instead of List, but the running time was even worst.
 Please help. Thanks.

 I'm not entirely sure how to interpret this. There was also an option to send a comment immediately but that seems to be a comment on the PR as a whole which isn't what I want. 
 I guess what I am asking if for people who use this package to give an overview of their workflow on how they might comment on a section of code and any other pointers that they have.

 I've read some of the org and org-roam documentation and as far as I understand it the main benefit of org-roam is easy linking. So I cobbled together a bunch of functions to have an easier linking experience in vanilla org (most probably this already exists and I just didn't find it).
 It lets me select a file from my org directory using fuzzy find, it lets me enter a name (or select from a list of aliases) and another function adds the selection of a specific item as link target.
 So my questions are:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm bad at merging and I'd love to change this.
 For context, I can't wrap my head around "theirs" and "ours" in merge conflict resolution tools. Especially since I'm often the solo dev and responsible for both! Since I vaguely remember all the code, I can't even go by "this looks foreign to me" as a heuristic to orient myself. I sometimes lose track when I rebase feature branches with 20 commits onto another branch a couple of files and commits down the road. It's horrible.
 I usually can't make sense of M-x diff output. I often use smerge and 3-way diffing in git projects, that helps a bit to see things in context, but not always.
 For my stupid brain, this is an accessibility problem
 Here's the solution I have in mind: to tweak how diff tools show both sides so that the versions have more meaningful names.
 Exmaples:
  
Merging foo into main, it'd be nice if the label reads "changes to be applied from foo" and "base from main".
 Rabasing banana onto divergent recipes, with the shared ancestor main, it'd be great if it reads "changes from banana" and "commonality from main" and "difference from main in recipes".
  
If you know a diff viewer, conflict resolution tool, whatever that allows this and how one might approach this, pointers would be appreciated! I can Elisp away myself a bit, but don't know where to start.

 I have some dependencies embedded in them like:
 //> using dep com.lihaoyi::os-lib:0.9.3 //> using dep com.lihaoyi::requests:0.8.0 
 and I'd like to have code completion for these libraries.
 I've tried:
  
IntelliJ IDEA + Scala plugin, it doesn't recognize dependencies. I've created imported in a separate module for the directory that contains my scripts, by using BSP, as it recommends the scala-cli documentation. It works fine for regular SBT projects.
 VisualStudio.code + Metals, code completion doesn't work. I don't have much experiencie with this tool.
  
In addition, with scala-cli, it is easy to experiment with newest Scala versions, before I migrate my SBT project from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3.
 IDEA doesn't realize that my scala script is using Scala 3.3.1 instead of 2.13.
 Which tools do you use for nice editing of scripts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I'm trying to do something in Scala and looking for an advice on why it might be a bad idea or on how to do it better.
 I have a CRUD application with several independent modules, where each one is responsible for one or more resources. Resources are classes such as "Task" or "User" with a specific given and modules are well... just traits:
 ``` trait Module[Name <: String]: def description: String = ???
 trait Resource[M, A]: def description: String = ???
 given Module["todo_list"] = new Module["todo_list"] {} given Resource["todo_list", Task] = Resource.register["todo_list", Task] // checks that "todo_list" is a known module ```
 Using this approach I can write generic functions such as:
  // Check that both module and resource are available to the User canRead[R: Resource](resource: R, by: User): IO[Boolean] 
 ...which is cool. But now I want to find out in runtime what resources are registered for a particular module:
  Module["todo_list"].resources.map(_.description) // a set of descriptions 
 How do I do that? I see two approaches:
  
Having a mutable ListBuffer inside the Module trait and just append instances when Resource.register is called - simple, but mutable
 Attaching every resource explicitly somewhere - logs of boilerplate
  
Could there be a better way?

 This will work but it's sad that foo, bar have to be var, not val.
 My workaround is like this:
 ``` class Clazz { lazy (foo, bar) = initFooBar()
 def init() = { foo bar ... }
 def initFooBar() = { foo = ... bar = ... (foo, bar) } } ```
 But this is awkward. Any better way in scala 2? Or is there any library to leverage?

 Using with-current-buffer doesn't work as it manipulates the buffer just fine but won't affect the window point (so switching to the buffer has the point in the same location where it last was, regardless of any changes made to the buffer).
 Is there a best practice of how to do this? Is it just making use of switch-to-buffer and switching back, once done with editing said buffer?

 Does anyone know of a way to do this or something similar? I think I could so something similar-ish by using org-transclusion, but it seems to go in the opposite direction (namely, that the separate documents are included into the big org file, but I would still need to edit them and export them from separate files).
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for reading and for any tips in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I just started out with Emacs because I wanted to use SLIME for Lisp, but I quickly realized how helpful it can be even without knowing most commands and keybindings.
 The fact that I can have something like a web browser integrated in Emacs is extremely helpful for my ADHD because I can just fire up Emacs in the tty, edit my code in one window and have online docs in the other window, and jump between them and copy stuff from the browser to my code, all in a single workflow, and without anything like YouTube distracting me or getting lost in tabs or desktop.
 While with other editors/environments I have to context-switch between at least 3 different workflows (editor, WM/tmux, browser, and usually other stuff like terminals), carefully configure them to not clash, and implement all sorts of nasty hacks to move data between them. And of course getting my thought process cut short is inevitable.
 Emacs makes it so much easier to stay focused on my project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context, I use Gnus for IMAP email (Fastmail). I like it enough, but figured I could give Rmail a try - you know, the endless itch to try things. In my case I am leaning on built-ins and if possibly smaller packages. Which Gnus is not. And Rmail is the "primary email reader". 
 I got the impression this setup could be less straightforward than the "it just works" approach of Gnus, but still. I installed movemail, made a backup copy with offlineimap in case I deleted all my messages by accident :) and then
 (setq rmail-primary-inbox-list '("imaps://my-user%40fastmail.com:the-password@imap.fastmail.com:993")) 
 It worked! Nice!. Except that I have a bunch of aliases (bills@mydomain.com, subscriptions@mydomain.com, etc.) and rules to redirect the messages to sub-directories of Inbox and I don't see a way to get those with movemail.
 I am guessing the config would be one mail file for each one of those directories? But still can't find how to set that up. 
 I might try pointing Rmail to the Maildir back up too, but just like IMAP, it is a one way conversion so I figured I would ask in case I destroy that synced copy for nothing :) 
 Thank you!
 PS: I would try Maildir as describe here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Mailbox-Formats.html

The Inferior Python still has access to the results of the cells (if they define a new variable for example), but it's just not showing any output, and the popups from the other ob-ipython buffers are very annoying. Is this expected behavior, and if so, is there some way I can reroute the output?

 ​
 but i'm in college so i have to ask,
 will it be helpful if i spent hours learning emacs?
 i used emacs for three days and couldn't change the tab spaces from 8 to 4
 i don't know how elisp works neither do i know what lisp is.
 are there themes in emacs that we can choose from because doom emacs looked really pale when i installed it
 is Emacs future proof?
 currently only highly elite people use emacs, and if we look at statistics the vim users are dominating the number of people using emacs, will emacs have good support in future because i will be sticking to my favourite editor for my entire lifetime i will be bound to it.
 should i learn emacs after my college ends?
 i learnt how to configure and use window managers but i honestly regret using them as my college sem cgpa lowered a lot using it converting to arch linux was a similar choice i love doing both things but they took a lot of time affecting my career if i had time i would absolutely choose learning window managers and using arch linux. will it be the same with emacs??

 I'm currently getting acquainted with Doom Emacs, and I've already experienced the benefits of org roam and local Python development. However, problems start to arise when I try to start developing in Python on a remote host for work. Not only have I not found any eglot configurations specific to working through Tramp, but the installation of pylsp for Python 3.7.3 is also not as smooth as I would like (perhaps it needs to be installed not in the user directory, but in the venv of the project).
 If anyone has any insights, guides, or experience working under these conditions, I am completely open to suggestions. Maybe I am completely wrong when I try to set all this up through Tramp and ssh-deploy, or the installation of a remote instance on the host will work much better.
 Please, help me!

 I've been using org-modern for ages now and I just took it out as it really has some weird issues with certain things (like with tables). So I'm back to straight up org-mode with org-superstar, as well as hiding markdown stuff. That all works great! But, I'm wondering:
 Is there a way to hide #+, < > and [ ]? Specifically:
 Turn #+filename: into filename: at the top and <2024-07-02> or [2024-07-02] into just 2024-07-02? I find them kinda ugly to look at in really nicely presented documents/files.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am setting up a blog (what kind of computer scientist would I be without one!) and I am opting to write it in markdown. I have a shell script that converts these into HTML files using Pandoc (because what kind of Haskell enthusiast would I be if I didn't use Pandoc!).
 I am using the Haskell library to make filters for my Pandoc, and I see I can use multiple instances of --filter but I would rather not and just have my one filter do everything I need. Lets say I wanted to do something to any Inline Str instance that starts with a @ and I also want to act on any Block Codeblock instance that is a $haskell type: ```haskell module Main where
 import qualified Data.Text as T import Text.Pandoc.JSON
 main :: IO () main = do -- toJSONFilter dollarHaskellBlock toJSONFilter linkToBlog return ()
 -- | Lets me act specially on codeblocks labeled '$haskell' dollarHaskellBlock :: Block -> Block dollarHaskellBlock (CodeBlock (identifier, cls:clss, keyValue) codeText) | cls == T.pack "$haskell" = CodeBlock (identifier, T.pack "haskell":clss, keyValue) newCodeText where newCodeText = codeText -- do something here dollarHaskellBlock x = x
 -- | adds a link to any blog with a word in the form @word linkToBlog :: Inline -> Inline linkToBlog (Str strText) | head strString == '@' = linkTo where strString = T.unpack strText linkTo = Link ( T.empty , [] , [] ) [ Underline [ Str (T.tail strText) ] ] ( T.pack ("./" ++ (tail . T.unpack . T.toLower) strText ++ ".html") , T.empty ) linkToBlog x = x ```
 In this case I can use one or the other here and the executable will act as a filter, but I feel like I should be able to do one after the other, but just running both in the do block fails :(.
 Is there a solution here? Thanks. 
 P.S. If you don't know what I am talking about here, IT IS GREAT, and you should totally check out Pandoc and Pandoc FIlters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm curious to get the opinion of the Emacs community on this issue, as basically all of my side projects revolve around Emacs package development.
 Background: I am looking to get away from GitHub for development. I would like something a little more in line with FOSS/Libre ideals.
 I've been on SourceHut for a while and I really like that there is 0 Javascript—it's fast, reliable, and has worked well so far. Trouble is, collaboration is a little trickier as it's all via mailing lists right now. I've appreciated learning about mailing lists and I have had some people collaborate with me on some software via email—so cool!—but I know this is a blocker for some people. Also, it's technically still in alpha; I know Prot recently left SourceHut due to some missing features, and I kind of look up to Prot's deliberate approach to all things development.
 An alternative I'm considering is Forgejo. (The Codeberg instance, specifically.) They seem to have similar goals in regards to free software and portability, but the workflow is much more PR-based, which is much more comfortable for many users.
 I'm curious to hear people's opinions on the two forges: where do you like developing software? (Especially Emacs related software.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks!
 I was wondering if anyone knows the current state of macro annotations in Scala 3 LTS:
 It all started a long time ago; I was intrigued by the new style of defining newtypes that libraries like Iron introduced in place of the typical @newtype annotation of the popular Scala 2 library, then I asked "why so much more boilerplate to create a value class?".
 Then I saw that more metaprogramming and macro-based libraries stopped using annotations in Scala 3 as well, and wondered if maybe it was just a change in style in general.
 So my question is, is it no longer possible to create macro annotations? If so, what is the reason for this? Compile time annotations like @tailrec or @depreciation still work, and I also saw that a MacroAnnotation class was introduced under an experimental flag in Scala 3.3.0, but I'm not sure what is left to accomplish so that it could be merged into the latest Scala version.
 I appreciate any clarification on this topic! Happy coding 😄.

For example, I want to do emacs binary.h5, but instead of showing the binary code, I want to show the result from h5ls binary.h5. 
 Of course I can use some hook to run the function I like, but the problem is that emacs would load the content of the file at some point, and I want to avoid this, because the size of the binary file can be huge.
 I think one way to solve this problem is to define my own functions in shell/emacs, and only use those functions to open the file. But I'm curious if there is a way to avoid emacs to load certain files. 
 Thanks.

 From what I've read, having (global-fontlock-mode t) and (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t) set should be enough, and it's described as over the top, yet very little is being highlighted. I did try tree-sitter, but then everything is highlighted to a ridiculous degree and even with the package tree-sitter-langs installed non eof the -ts modes find a configuration. I've read that font-lock mode is good enough, so I'm wondering what I'm missing to get more highlighting?

 I've been using Emacs for a couple months now as my primary editor and a little longer before for just Lisp-related stuff. I have my config (~500 LOC) I'm pretty comfortable with but it's far from perfect. It's a little messy, not everything works as expected. Like I still don't know how to set custom font for Emacs client or solaire mode doesn't work for some reason despite using themes that support it, not a big deal but it'd be nice to make them work. Now I'm thinking whether is it better to polish my current config so I have everything set up exactly how I want or to use some distribution that makes it all easier. I know it's pretty much matter of preferences, but it's hard to make a decision by myself not knowing what I miss from Doom/Spacemacs nor what trade-offs there are + I already have somehow functional config and I don't know if at this point making a switch is a right move.
 And, despite I'm ex hardcore Vim user I don't use evil-mode in Emacs (I mostly do program in Lisp languages in which Vim keybinding is just useless thanks to structural editing and paredit), but I know both of these distribution use evil-mode by default. So what is their support for Emacs keybinding?

Unfortunately the closest thing to getting a directory is `cabal list-bin` which seems fragile for this (would require some string manipulation/isn't guaranteed). 
 I would prefer against setting `-hidir` if possible as some programs (cabal/ghc-pkg) assume that the location is not changed (though I do have workarounds for this case). Notably setting `-hidir` causes build failures with cabal unless you do a build without the flag first... 
 If anyone has any ideas here I would greatly appreciate it.

 If an instance doesn't satisfy the laws, that can cause all sorts of problems. But how big of an issue is this, empirically speaking? I'm looking for examples of real-world bugs in typeclass instances. I'd like to get a sense of things like:
 - How common are these bugs?
 - How are unlawful typeclass instances discovered? E.g., are they found via property testing, or by tracking down the issue from some other bug? Are they found by maintainers of the package or other users?
 - Are there typeclasses whose laws seem particularly prone to bugs?

This generally works well except it's not respecting a .nvmrc, of course, and I'm debating writing some elisp to switch nvm versions when compiling and there exists an .nvmrc (for non JS devs, this a file that specifies the Node version to use in a directory).
 Got me to think, are there any alternative, and perhaps superior, ways to start long running processes like this? Obviously opening a shell is an option but I've been tending to avoiding doing that where possible.

Despite their many capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have a serious
limitation: they’re stuck in time and their knowledge is limited to the data
they have been trained on.
Updating the knowledge of an LLM can take two forms: fine-tuning, which we will
address in a future post, and the ever-present RAG.
RAG, short for Retrieval Augmented Generation, has garnered a lot of attention
in the GenAI community and for good reasons. You “simply” hook the LLM up to your
documents (more on that later), and it can suddenly tackle any question, as
long as the answer is somewhere in the documents.
This is almost too good to be true: it offers endless possibilities, a simple

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note, I still have a lot to learn.
 One thing that I find valuable in programming is abstracting the implementation. For example, we can have a module A that defines a certain function type, that is actually implemented in a separate module.
 For the purpose of learning, I made a simple example of the StopWatch implementation: https://github.com/igr/exemplatory/tree/main/stopwatch/haskell-mtl
 My goal is to have Stopwatch module that is NOT aware of the implementation of the function that returns (IO) current time. Of course, I am using current time just for the sake of the example; it can be any other function that the module does not need to know about.
 I know that Haskell allows that, but would warn about orphan instances. For that purpose, I followed the GHC compiler advice and used the wrapped type; although I liked the code better with orphan instance.
 I wonder—what would be the better way to implement such StopWatch? I could make everything simpler and have a function that just accepts the timestamp instead of a function that generates one; but would I encapsulate the stopwatch business capabilities in a correct way?

 haskell -- TODO: There must be a way to return a pair of Proxies. This is *really close* to full dependent types -- though. These proxies should be tagged with proofs that their Nat is less than i, which is something -- we *do* know at compile-time, but the problem is that we can't know what these values are until runtime. -- So while the only information we have about these type level numbers is that they are less than i (which -- is a compile-time fact), we don't know what they are exactly until runtime. closestInternalNodes :: forall n m i mostprev mostnext.

 I'd like to make the window (Emacs Frame) stand out from the other windows but the only thing I've been able to do is to undecorate the frame, but it removes any shadow and rounded corners and looks kind of out of tone with the rest of the windows. It would be neat to have rounded corners but no title bar or some similar customization, but I do not know if Emacs can edit its client side decorations. (I'm using GNOME 45)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm currently facing an issue with configuring Emacs on WSL to open Excel files using the Windows Excel program. I've tried the following configuration, inspired by the awesome Bozhidar's blog post on setting the default browser[1] by:
  (when (and (eq system-type 'gnu/linux) (getenv "WSLENV")) ;; Configure opening Excel files from WSL (setq org-file-apps '(("\\.xlsx\\'" . "cmd.exe /c start excel \"%s\"")))) 
 Then in Org file in the same directory as xlsx file I have following link:
  [[file:test.xlsx][test]] 
 finally I run org-open-at-point (C-c C-o) being with the point over the link.
 While Excel opens successfully, the specified file doesn't get passed as an argument to the Excel command. I'm wondering if there's a correct way to pass the file path as the last argument in the command. Has anyone encountered a similar issue or can provide insights on how to resolve it?
 Also I tested from the terminal of the WSL distro the command itself
  cmd.exe /c start excel test.xlsx 
 And it works properly.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ekg is a note taking package that is tag-based, and uses sqlite for storage. The new version 0.5.0 is out, featuring the following major changes:
  
Inline tags! Now you can just add tags as you type, which I find very convenient. The tags are, in org-mode, turned into org-mode links, so those who like this style of having links in one note that enable "backlinks" will find this more familiar. The backlinks here are just the tag showing the notes that have the link to that tag.
 
ekg-auto-save, a module by Qingshui Zheng that let's you enable saving notes automatically as you write them, which works in a similar way to the emacs auto-save functionality. If you write longer notes, this should be useful.
 
Improvements to org-mode notes. Because of the way our notes buffer works, it has metadata at the top which has read-only elements that interfere with org-mode. We now have some ability to narrow the buffer before the appropriate org-mode commands so that they work correctly. But this solution isn't perfect, and more work needs to be done. 
 
Trash simplification - I previously had the notion that trashing a note should trash the individual tags, prepending them all with "trash/". That idea never really panned out, and was adding too much complication, so now there's just a "trash" tag. If your note has that tag, it's in the trash.
 
Aborting a note. If you are capturing a note, save it as a draft, but then want to just abandon both the note and the draft, you can do that with C-c C-k. Also thanks to Qingshui Zheng!
 
Many bug fixes.

 I'm not able to make this work the way I want without resorting to the following: explicitly requiring project.el, and copy/pasting the code from magit-extras that sets the magit command to so:
 ``` (require 'project)
 ;; Git management (use-package magit)
 ;; Copied from magit/magit-extras.el (when (and (boundp 'project-prefix-map) ;; Only modify if it hasn't already been modified. (equal project-switch-commands (eval (car (get 'project-switch-commands 'standard-value)) t))) (keymap-set project-prefix-map "m" #'magit-project-status) (add-to-list 'project-switch-commands '(magit-project-status "Magit") t)) ```
 There must be a way to do this without the need of repeating code, but I failed to make other approaches work.
 Any help is welcomed.

 Intro: I'm new to OrgMode. Currently using Workflowy. 
 I currently use a daily template with a predefined series of tasks on top of which I add new ones.
 Separately I have a weekly template for the training routine. I usually "instantiate" this template at the beginning of the week and then on specific days I refer to items from it.
 Questions:
  
I have read about Capture templates. Are these the mechanism I should use to define templates?
 How can I link/refer to a task somewhere in the tree from another subtree?
  
with gratitude,
 Alex

 The description of the problem is below. My solution for anyone who faced with such an issue: 1. Emacs has amazing tool M-x describe-variable 2. M-x describe-variable RET lsp-diagnostics-provider RET should open a window with explanation of this variable and current value 3. To resolve the problem the value should be "flycheck", here is details what is it https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/settings/diagnostics/#lsp-diagnostics-provider 4. And here is about flycheck https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/index.html 5. You can set the value programmatically or with Emacs UI 6. Enjoy your errors!)
 But still, I get separate window on hover, even with (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show nil)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use Emacs (doom, 29.1) via the daemon in MacOS (14.3, apple M2). I used to have the emacs-plus installed, but switched to emacs-macport. The first one seemed to have a homebrew service installed for the daemon, but it never worked for me, not sure why. I'm now trying to set up the daemon for emacs-macport.
 What I've gathered so far:
 - Opening emacs GUI and doing m-x start-server make the process be attached to that OS Window and, when it is closed, it all dies together.
 - running /opt/homebrew/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --daemon gives me the terminal output I would expect when starting the daemon and a process, but when I try to emacsclient -cn, it opens a terminal emacs, not a GUI.
 Daemon start command output:
 Starting Doom Emacs in daemon mode! Initializing org-roam database... Clearing removed files... Clearing removed files...done Processing modified files... Processing modified files...done Copilot agent started. Starting Emacs daemon. Doom loaded 285 packages across 47 modules in 5.113s 
 - when using the launchctl, as indicated in the wiki (with the modifications to emacs' path, and --fg-daemon), it starts the process with the same output as above. But, when trying to emacsclient -cn it gives me *ERROR*: Terminal type xterm-kitty is not defined. Doing export TERM=xterm does fix that, but it still opens a (rather very bugged) terminal frame.
 - Lastly, I tried creating an Emacs.app via Automator, but when invoked, it gives me the error could not get terminal name, which, I suppose, comes from the fact it is trying to open in a terminal, not GUI.
 TL;DR: It seems I've managed to open the server, but not to open a GUI frame. Any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using awesome-tray and like the layout a lot. It does have some problems though, for instance there are errors on startup and I'm not able to set the color successfully. I'm wondering if anyone has experience with these type of packages?
 Another one that works well is mini-echo which is free of errors, but the code is structured in an advanced lisp style that's hard for me to interpret, so I have not been able to customize it for different reasons.
 It would be good to fix the errors in awesome-tray and improve it. The errors I get are fairly simple:
 awesome-tray.el: Warning: Pattern t is deprecated. Use _ instead [2 times]
 Warning: setting attribute ‘:background’ of face ‘mode-line-buffer-id’: nil value is invalid, use ‘unspecified’ instead.
 Warning: setting attribute ‘:foreground’ of face ‘region’: nil value is invalid, use ‘unspecified’ instead.Unable to load color "color" [2 times]
 I've been able to override how awesome-tray displays major modes with a list of shorthand strings and change the time format, so it seems easy to customize. I suspect setq awesome-tray-mode-line-active-color doesn't work because of the above errors, but I'm not certain.
 Anyway are there any other packages that would be a good choice, or does anyone have some advice on how I might go about fixing or improving awesome-tray? My lisp knowledge on it's own is not enough to locate the problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What kinds of buffers do you wish you could bookmark in Emacs that you can't usefully bookmark already? Emacs can of course bookmark specific locations in regular text files, but also several types of non-file buffers: dired, eshell, Man, eww, Info, help, image, vc-dir, doc-view, possibly others. Are there any others you'd like to be able to bookmark?
 Here are some ideas:
  
occur and grep buffers (jumping to the bookmark would rerun the search).
 
REPLs. I can imagine this being useful: you bookmark a Python REPL and later jumping to the bookmark starts a new REPL and reruns all the import statements you had run before (or maybe just reruns everything?, or everything marked with a special comment?)
 
shells. The eshell bookmarks are great, and that's what I use, but not everyone uses eshell. A shell bookmarker should preserve the current directory and whether you were ssh'ed into some other computer.
 
Shell command output buffers, the bookmarks should rerun the command. Same for compilation buffers (revert-buffer already knows how to rerun the compilation!).
 
 I'd love to see some more ideas for missing bookmark capabilities.

 I'm trying to find a good, generic, folding solution based on indentation level. This is just because I tend to have formatting outputs that don't have specific configuration for hs-minor-mode. hs-minor-mode seems like a good solution in general, but looks like it doesn't come with an obvious indentation-based level solution?
 I have used yafolding but in general I have found that I can't get yafolding-toggle-all to do something predictable. What it chooses to fold is never predictable to me.
 Any solution using hs-minor-mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is the _ALL suffix not allowed for Special Properties?
 I've been trying to restrict the values that can be given to the CATEGORY property. Now I know that for a property I define -- MYPROP, say -- I can specify a set of allowed values by giving them as a list to the property MYPROP_ALL for example:
 #+PROPERTY: MYPROP_ALL Value1 Value2 Value3 
 Then if I use ‘C-c C-x p’ (‘org-set-property’) and answer "MYPROP" to its first prompt, the second prompt (which wants the value) forces me to stick to the list in MYPROP_ALL.[1] Also, both ‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-property-next-allowed-value’) and ‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-property-previous-allowed-value’ respect the MYPTOP_ALL list as well.
 But when it comes to Special Properties that doesn't appear to work. So if I have:
 #+PROPERTY: CATEGORY_ALL Value1 Value2 Value3 
 then ‘C-c C-x p’ (‘org-set-property’) ignores the list in CATEGORY_ALL.[1] Furthermore, neither ‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-property-next-allowed-value’) nor ‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-property-previous-allowed-value’ pay attention to it either. In fact both of them respond with "Allowed values for this property have not been defined".
 Is that the expected behavior, or am I doing something wrong?
 [1] Org may well give a completion list, but only if CATEGORY has already been given values elsewhere in the file, and then the list consists of all those values, and it still ignores CATEGORY_ALL. And that list of pre-used values is not enforced, the way an _ALL list is. It is merely a list of suggestions that can be ignored; brand new values can be entered without being trapped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was recently working on a "Durable Key-Value Store" implementation in ZIO. The implementation was pretty straightforward, but I had to make sure that the log file is not accessed concurrently by multiple fibers. I could have used a Ref to keep track of the state, but I came across Semaphore in ZIO and decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to use. 
 This is my new blog post about how to use Semaphore to implement concurrency control in ZIO.

They open text files that contain "code" in one, and everything else in the other. I've only seen one example of someone realizing this was weird and taking the time to configure notepad++ to be able to handle code as well. (why not open regular text in VSCode?). I've also seen an example of someone running two VScodes, one for the project and the other for the test project, and notepad++ for editing config files.
 Does anyone find it weirder that no one seems to think this is a weird thing to do?

 I'm reading a string from console:
 add vet james bond espionage <command> <context> <command specific arguments> 
 My ADTs looked like this:
 object Context: case object Vet extends Context case object Owner extends Context trait Command trait ContextedCommand[T <: Context] extends Command { val arguments: List[String] } case class Add[T <: Context](context: T, arguments: List[String]) extends ... more commands 
 My flow is: read string from console -> validate command & context -> validate arguments depending on context and command (pattern matching) -> execute specific "Repository" method depending on command + context (pattern matching) .
 What refactoring should I do, if I'm trying to go to the tagless final approach?
 Currently I'm going in circles fiddling with the code from the command and implementing something that seems wrong and scrapping it.
 Would the correct refactoring steps be:
  
remove context: T from Command proprties
 validate command & context the same way 
 create separate given instances for validators addVetValidator() / addOwnerValidator()
 continue with distinct given instances for command handling logic 
  
I've watched RockTheJvm's video/article and DevInsideYou's series but I feel like I'm too grug brained.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for verbose, detail is here.
 At first, I'm reading https://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf to understand "Free monad". I mean the word FFree in title is from this paper.
 And maybe I have been able to understand what is FFree in this paper. This paper says FFree is a data type which has two aspects Pure and Impure, especially Impure works as an action handler like monad's >>= and it presents fmap. I think that FFree seems very simple and reasonable.
 So I implemented FFree monad as written in the paper. ```haskell {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} import Control.Monad ((>=>)) data FFree f a where Pure :: a -> FFree f a Impure :: f x -> (x -> FFree f a) -> FFree f a
 instance Monad (FFree f) where Impure fx k' >>= k = Impure fx (k' >=> k) Pure a >>= k = k a ```
 And I need Functor and Applicative for Monad instance.
 ```haskell instance Functor (FFree f) where fmap f (Pure a) = Pure (f a) -- Continuous is here, impressible. fmap f (Impure fx k) = Impure fx (fmap f . k)
 instance Applicative (FFree f) where pure = Pure Pure f <> Pure a = Pure (f a) Pure f <> Impure fx k = Impure fx (fmap f . k) Impure fx f <> p@(Pure _) = Impure fx (\x -> f x <> p) -- I have no idea how implement this pattern. Impure fx f <> Impure gx g = undefined `` I could writeFunctorwith no problem (maybe), but I couldn't write<>implementation betweenImpurecase. Here is my question again, how do I implementFFree` of Applicative?
 From the first, What does Applicative applying between Impure mean theoretically?
 P.S. No need to ensure what a compiler says, I know why I can't it. Left hand f x and right hand one are rigid types each other.

 A few questions

 What is the best Emacs package archive these days? my setup references MELPA and ELPA.
 it seems something called "Embark" is replacing helm? Currently my attempt to load emacs from init.el choked on trying to call init-helm:
  Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-missing "Cannot open load file" "No such file or directory" "helm-config") require(helm-config) load-with-code-conversion("c:/code/emacs/init/init-helm.el" "c:/code/emacs/init/init-helm.el" nil t) require(init-helm) load-with-code-conversion("c:/code/emacs/init/init-custom-packages.el" "c:/code/emacs/init/init-custom-packages.el" nil t) require(init-custom-packages) eval-buffer() ; Reading at buffer position 185 funcall-interactively(eval-buffer) command-execute(eval-buffer record) execute-extended-command(nil "eval-buffer" "eval-b") funcall-interactively(execute-extended-command nil "eval-buffer" "eval-b") command-execute(execute-extended-command)

The definitive fix would involve refining the logic within org-roam-db-sync, but until then, a workaround is to set the path to its true location or use the file-truename function as shown below:
 elisp (setq org-directory (file-truename "~/Notebooks/") org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/Notebooks/RoamNotes/") ) 
 Discovering the Issue:
 Each time I fired up Emacs or initiated a db sync, I was greeted with the all-too-familiar "Processing modified files..." message, which seemed to take an eternity even on my beefy M2 Mac. Rather than incrementally updating, the process was going through eve…]]></summary>

 I.e.
 * Level 1 ** Level 1a ** Level 1b * Level 2 ** Level 2a ** Level 2b 
 I.e. operate on Level 1b to produce (with all the heading contents intact):
 * Level 1 ** Level 1a * Level 2 ** Level 1b ** Level 2a ** Level 2b 
 In the world of lispy/paredit, this would be barfing from Level 1, slurping to the beginning of Level 2. 
 The only thing I can figure is to promote Level 1b by a level, move point down to Level 2, move Level 2 up above Level 1b, return to Level 1b, demote it a level.

 ```
 type X = A | B | C
 ```
 Is it possible to make a type which represents the concept of "any of this type except these types"? 
 I have the following data types.
 ```
 trait Base {}
 trait Special extends Base {}
 trait A extends Special {}
 trait B extends Special {}
 trait C extends Base {}
 trait D extends Base {}
 ```
 I am looking for something like `type Y = Base - Special`. Today, I could write that as `type Y = C | D`. However, next week, someone might create `trait E extends Base`, at which point that definition of `Y` becomes out of date. At the location where one would logically create `E`, it is not at all obvious that you would need to update `Y`. 
 Is something like this supported in the compiler? I didn't find it in the documentation, but then I couldn't even find the documentation for `|`, so I obviously did not find a potentially relevant part of the documentation.

 Is there a way for me to set the height of alternative fonts?
 Alternatively, can anyone recommend a monospace font that I could use for both Latin and Chinese text?

 This is 100% my fault, but i have no clue how to even begin troubleshooting this. Any tips on how to get to the bottom of this without having to manually go through my plugins one-by-one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I dunno if anyone else has run into this but I have a buffer; let's say 9 lines. And I have a function which runs (previous-line) (beginning-of-line 1) and said function is bound to a key (let's say <up>).
 So I apply a text-property of 'invisible using (pos-bol) of the first line and (1+ (pos-eol)) in order to get the first line to disappear, like it's not even there.
 If I'm on line 3 and M-: my function, it does what I'd expect and (point) will return the (pos-bol) of the second line. But, if I execute my function by pressing <up> from line 3, (point) keeps returning back 1, the point of the beginning of line 1 rather than the point at the beginning of line 2.
 Is this expected behavior? I'd be less weirded out if running code through M-: gave back similar results but I get what I'd expect to happen no matter what code I run and only the unexpected behavior when running the exact same code via a key binding.
 This seems to happen even when running Emacs with -Q. Also occurs when I try with (backward-char) and C-b: so long as it's the first line – at the top of the buffer – which is invisible, there's a difference between executing code by itself vs. via key commands (with the latter putting me at point 1, every time).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at the docs for tree-sitter. I think I'm pretty sold on trying it out for c++ programming, as there's a lot of utility in smarter highlighting (and easy customization of the grammar). 
 However, I have a question (of course): 
 The only examples I could find of custom highlighting was assigning custom faces to different syntactic elements.
 But I need not to just be able to change the font but also display properties so that I can provide substitutions (unicode symbols for example), the 'raise property for superscripts, :align-to to keep my end of line comments lined up since I use proportional fonts, and more. 
 Can it do that? 
 I suppose I could combine other highlighting packages to get this functionality, but the thing I was hoping to get out of tree-sitter was better accuracy in my substitution operators as well, using syntax queries instead of regexs.

 So I had my old dog of a laptop die on me the other day and had to run out and buy a new one. Settled on an M2 Air since I mostly do writing, documents and some analysis and the version is Sonoma 14.3. I live in Emacs, I do all my writing with it and basically feel like I can't live without it. I have been running Railwaycats emacsport for, I dunno eight years or so..? Installed via Homebrew, which I don't really have much experience with since it always just worked whenever I've used it. But this time with this new computer I really can't seem to figure out how to get it done nor what I dare to do. Has anyone else been through this? If so how did you do it? Should I just try with "--cask" even though my OS isn't listed?
 If you don't know what I'm talking about, this is the repo: https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport
 I am confused and looking for some guidance here. I was hoping one of you pros had some.
 Thanks!

I have Noto Color Emoji installed on my system

 using emacs-nativecomp in arch linux
  
when running describe-char on emojis I get 
 display: no font available
 
Trying different font with
 (set-fontset-font t 'emoji '("JoyPixels" . "iso10646-1") nil 'prepend) has no effect
 
I have the following config, can any of this cause emojis not to display? 
 
 ``` (setq default-font-height 120) (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Fira Code" :height default-font-height :weight 'regular)
 (set-fontset-font t 'arabic (font-spec :family "Amiri Typewriter")) (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "Fira Code" :height default-font-height :weight 'regular :fontset "fontset-default")

 I want to remotely connect to an instance of SSH running on a remote OSX machine (to save files I forgot to save).
 So I run (in the terminal)
  emacsclient -t 
 Then I get (momentarily) emacs to display a buffer in this terminal. But in around 3 seconds, it quits and I am back into the command line.
 This problem happens even if I am running emacsclient inside Terminal in front of the computer running emacs (no ssh involved).
 I can do it over and over again, and I am always getting the same result. I have checked and this is a problem I also have locally.
 I have checked that I run the emacsclient that corresponds with my emacs installation (Emacs-29.1, in /Applications/Emacs.app/
 Does anybody have any idea what is going on?
 thank you in advance,

I wanted to see if I could work on the assignment in Doom emacs, and quickrun seemed like the easiest solution to having the same functionality as the run button in vscode instead of manually compiling every class in a project. I tried executing quickrun on the main class but it seems like it's not recognizing the other class in the package.

 Are there any additional steps to setting up quickrun correctly?

This process not only presented some technical challenges but also involved a substantial amount of work. There are many usage scenarios to support, and the testing alone took nearly two weeks.
 With this, Metanote's support for the core features of Org mode is more comprehensive, including basic document structure, custom task management, custom InBufferSettings like tags, Agenda views, custom Capture, and more. I believe Metanote is now one of the most complete applications supporting Org mode outside of Emacs. In future development, we will gradually introduce support for rich text rendering, including images, tables, hyperlinks, encryption, export functions, Roam Research, and more. Stay tuned.

I wonder if it would help new users learn about monads if we said "a Monad is something that has a do notation, and you have to write >>= to explain what its do notation means".
 Personally I find (m >>= g) >>= h == m >>= (\x -> g x >>= h) really obscure and (f >=> g) >=> h == f >=> (g >=> h) really cool, but not relevant to practice, but I find
 do y <- do x <- m f x g y == do x <- m y <- f x g y 
 really practical and straightforward. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 Long-time Emacs user (this is my 8th year!) and lurker on this sub. I use Emacs for *nearly* everything. Coding, reading, writing, RSS, ToDos, knowledge base, website, music etc.
 So, I'm juggling Emacs on a bunch of different setups: a Linux machine with Ubuntu at home, a RHEL workstation and a node I ssh into at work, a MacOS laptop, a few Raspberry Pis. You see where this is going. Each has different uses, but some core things that I like to keep consistent.
 With the mix of OSX, Ubuntu, RHEL, plus the GUI and TTY variations, I need to change my Emacs config on every machine (even though a lot stays the same across the board).
 The real headache starts when I change something on one machine, and I want to apply that to all (or some) of the other machines. Yak shaving and all...
 Right now, my setup's built around an init.el that loads up a settings.org file, which has my literate config. The way I deal with some things (for example, remapping key bindings on MacOS) is by wrapping it up with conditionals. But it's looking quite ugly and is more annoying to maintain.
 I wonder what the best approach here is. Split my config into multiple files and load them as needed depending on where I am? Maybe mess around with Git branches for different setups? (And how would I even start with that?) Git submodules?
 Are there some tools that already deal with this? I am sure this is not an Emacs-only problem.
 Thanks in advance and would love to hear how you deal with this :)

 I'm a newbie with emacs and this may be a stupid question, but I'm using Doom Emacs (Evil) using emacs-plus 29.2 on Mac using homebrew (Apple Silicon) and I'm in org-mode (version 9.7) using org-bullets and after I finish writing my bullet points, I can't seem to unindent. How do I achieve this?
 Example:
  
Item 1 
 Item 2
 
  
(Next line are indented at same indentation as item 2)
 I want to reset back to left most region after item 2 and not remain indented.

 Copying the DLL from the previous Emacs 29.1 solves the issue.
 When comparing with 29.1, I see the following are missing in 29.2, despite downloading the full version with dependencies:
 emacs-29.1/bin/libgmpxx-4.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libgnutls-openssl-27.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libgnutlsxx-30.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libharfbuzz-gobject-0.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libharfbuzz-icu-0.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libharfbuzz-subset-0.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libtiffxx-5.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libturbojpeg.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libwebpdecoder-3.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libwebpmux-3.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libXpm-noX4.dll 
 I do not know what could be the implications in terms of missing functionalities.
 What do you suggest doing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am building a small compiler in Haskell and I just finished the syntax analysis phase. During syntax analysis, it was easy to keep track of the line and column numbers where the parsing failed and report back what was expected and what the compiler needed. 
 But if the parsing succeeds, the generated AST is passed on to check the semantics. However, my AST nodes do not store any positional (or spanning) information. So if I find a semantic error, I can only tell what the error is but cannot provide any line or column number information.
 The easiest way to solve this is to store the spanning information on most nodes I have defined, which is tedious and lengthy. Additionally, I would have to write boilerplate code on parsing functions. 
 Is there any other method you'd recommend for this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a rather vague idea that is still forming:
 Could a SoC project be proposed to train or fine-tune a LLM on Scala code?
 Most LLMs are primarily trained on Python code, just because there is so much of it, leading to more generated Python code, ...
 For Scala there is less code to train on, on the other hand models like Phi-2 show that a smaller set of highly curated training data (in this case well-written code) can make even smaller models compete with bigger ones trained on "the internet".
 A fork of e.g. CodeLlama 70B, fine-tuned with the full Git history of successful Scala projects might decrease the gap between code generation capabilities for Python and Scala.
 The aider project proposes a diff format that is more amenable to LLM generation than the standard Git diff. The transformation from one to the other should be rather mechanical and a well-written Git commit is a very close to an instruction a human might give an LLM in order to get a code modification done, so hopefully one could get a sufficient amount of decent training data from existing open source Scala repos. 
 I created a GitHub issue on the ScalaCenter Google Summer of Code repo as well, but Reddit might be a better place for brainstorming and discussion.
 Feel free to post any ideas, critique, proposals related to the topic here.

 At that stage it may become easier to copy out the row being edited and the headers to a new table, transpose it and edit vertically, transpose it back again and insert it into its original position without the headers.
 This is rather like the form mode in spreadsheets which enable a wide column to be viewed without navigating horizontally.
 The problem is the formulas get messed up in the process.
 Is there some fix out there for this issue.

 Obviously gdb and other tools are on the container, it's just likely that the path used (/docker:<container-id>:/path/to/binary) doesn't exist in dap's eyes. Anyone thought about or have some sort of workaround for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Magit is an unbelievable tool. But maybe even more unbelievable is that it has an integration to most Git repository hosting services one can imagine. Github for sure, and Gitlab as well, but also self-hosted Gitlab instances work perfectly well!
 I can review pull requests, easily add comments and of course pull all the changes from that PR to my local Git repository. For me, the best part is however just opening the right repo in the web browser. That way I can easily see CI pipeline status in seconds.
 Setting up a Magit forge is little bit of work. But it really pays off. Totally recommend.
 By the way, I noticed that in Github Magit has 427 supporters and in LiberaPay 130. I like round numbers a lot more. How about 450 and 140?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was wondering if there was a way to copy a date from a capture source in org-capture to use as the value for :time-prompt so that I don't have to type it in every time. I do not want it to insert today's date, I have fixed dates that I want to add to a datetree. I want it to keep the timestamp and file it and its header in the correct place in the date tree (unless that's redundant... I'm not sure).
 So what I've been trying to move (technically I want this to occur every two weeks but just starting small to test it):
 ** Recycling
 <2024-01-30 Tue>
 I can only get it to work through setting :time-prompt to t and typing the date in manually. But this is tedious
 Managed to thoroughly confuse myself so I'm giving up and asking. If I'm not going about this a sensible way feel free to tell me also. Thank you.
 edit: I should say I have read the documentation multiple times. I may have missed something though. I have also tried to google my problem but I struggled to find anything fully relevant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently learning to use emacs and org/org-roam. So far it doesn't seem too complicated and I could implement a note taking system that would work for me. But I barely scratched the surface and wonder if I could make my current workflow (coming from Obsidian) work.
 So what I currently do is to mostly take daily notes in which I have a template that covers the following:
  
What did I do (just a bunch of bullet points)
 Ideas 
 Each idea is a bulletpoint
 Each idea has some metadata like "subject:: homelab"
 
 Daily journal (some bulletpoints)
 Tasks 
 New Tasks, that I want to get done (tasks usually have metadata to categorize them)
 A list of all tasks I finished today
 
  
Then I have a couple of notes that display this information in a grouped way. For example I have a tasks note that displays all my open tasks. And I have a homelab note, that lists all ideas and tasks with the metadata "subject:: homelab" under headings for ideas and tasks. Also the list of completed tasks in the daily note is auto populated with tasks that have the completed date set to today.
 Now I'm trying to do something similar with org-roam. 
 TL;DR: I want to query my org-roam notes for specific data that is marked with metadata and display it in other notes
 Thank you!

 I did some research and this is what I came up with.
 (defun projectile-project-with-python-interpreter () "Launch run-python when you open a projectile python project." (interactive) (progn (when (derived-mode-p 'python-mode) (setq projectile-switch-project-action #'run-python)))) (add-hook 'projectile-before-switch-project-hook #'projectile-project-with-python-interpreter) 
 This function correctly sets the variable if I execute it with M-x. I've confirmed that with C-h v. Run-python still doesn't run. This is my first attempt at an elisp function. Am I missing something obvious?

 I have created WikiMusic, an invite-only community, with a well spirited effort to share musical knowledge with the world. This means tabs and PDFs for several instruments for music of all kind.
 The backend for WikiMusic is made with Haskell, using Servant, Free monads (freer-simple), Hasql and more.
 I am more of a backend dev type of person, but dabble in frontend every now and then. The frontend works with Svelte, Tailwind, Skeleton. The platform works with Haskell (.nix), Nix, PostgreSQL and others.
 I'd love to hear your experiences with the page, and with the UX, the Haskell code, and look forward to feedback you may have. If you want to become a member of WikiMusic feel free to email me at [jjbigorra@gmail.com](mailto:jjbigorra@gmail.com)

This works well, except when it comes to lsp integration. Sometimes the "global" server that is installed via lsp via the prompt won't play nice when I switch language versions and simply crashes over and over for every file I open.
 Any suggestions on how I can set my config to check for an lsp server installed in the project dir? In fact, it would be very useful if emacs only used/installed in the project dir and never used/installed servers to the emacs directory.

The only thing I could find online was this repo project but I am brand new at Nix and quickly lost, I'm also not sure it's a good idea to copy their build scripts (issue).
 So question: How do I for example have Obelsik use my custom Activity which can platform-specific code? A good solution should allow me to provide platform-specific implementations which may be used by the platform-agnost…]]></summary>

My main workflow is to make a series of changes in a git project and then diff them against the checked in versions before doing a commit as a last check. ediff-revision works for single files although quitting is sometimes a bit odd. 
 But ediff-directory-revision doesn't seem to do what I want.
  
It only seems to operate on a directory and not recursively below it. 
 All the files popup in the registry rather than just the ones that have changed.
  
Is there some way to get the behavior I want. (A tree view of the fileset would be a nicety)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I am Haskell newbie and I am little bit confused about "built-in" types concept in Haskell. Coming from C++ background, I understand "built-in" as constructs recognizable by compiler without including external libraries. In Haskell however I see in many literature sources, types like Int|Num| Bool, are treated as "built-in", or core language features, though they can be easily "excluded", by disabling Prelude module, which in my understanding is just external "library" included by default. To add to confusion, some core language constructs, like guards will not even work without including Prelude. On other hand constructs like 
 import Prelude() 
 foo x = 1
 compiles well, but then what is the "1" type in this case (Isn't Num defined by including Prelude)?
 So I guess the question is - Where true (in C++ sense) bult-in language features can be found if at all. And should Prelude be understood as true external library or as "grey area" combining both traits of external library and compiler intrinsic syntax.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My orgmode document contains some symbols that begin and end with double-underscores. For example __HELLO__. When I export to HTML, it sees this as the emphasis directive to underline and I get no underscores. How can I toggle this behavior and/or escape the underscores? Is the only solution to hack the text with some zero-width-spaces?
 Thanks!

 I'm currently starting to learn and develop with Haskell. While I developed with Haskell I really started to like the idea to express errors in types and make them explicit so that you have to handle them. Now I started to develop a small app with Flutter and Dart and i was really surprised that Dart more or less just provides unchecked exceptions by default. Because I thought Dart is a relative young language I was wondering, why one would decide to design the language this way. Is there a real benefit?
 The question is not directly to Haskell related, but I thought there are many smart people here and maybe someone could explain it to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love the Agenda time grid but when I have large gaps in it due to a variety of tasks that will take a few hours each it would be nice to show this visually. I know I can do a two active schedule dates with some dashes to get it to show a span of time i.e. <date>--<date> . 
 However I'd prefer if I could do some prefix / augmentation to the agenda like below. Imagine the prep of salads would take 2.5 hours and is marked with 2.5 hrs of effort. 
  Task: 18:30...... Scheduled: NEXT Prep Salads for Wed/Thurs/Fri |-> 19:00...... |-> 20:00...... |-> 21:00...... Reminder: 21:30...... Start Evening Wind Down Habit: 22:00...... Scheduled: NEXT Evening Review 
 I know a some lisp and want to learn more...but org and agenda are quite big code bases to jump into fresh. Figured I'd ask here before I start down this road of trying to make the feature. 
 Full solutions or even just some food for thought or starting points of what to look into would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started learning Haskell today and am using GHCi interactive terminal. 
 Since Haskell is lazy strongly typed language , it shouldn't even try to evalute different types. So I checked types of two different entities. ( Are they objects as in C++ or python, or are they something else , I don't know what the runtime model of Haskell is ? )
 ghci> :t "abc"
 "abc" :: String
 ghci> :t ['a','b','c']
 ['a','b','c'] :: [Char]
 Okay, so list of Char is different from String. So they shouldn't evalute when checked for equality. Since [Char] and String are clearly different types, why following is evaluted? 
 ghci> "abc" == ['a','b','c']
 True

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I've got the problem that "turning back in time" is not possible from org roam dailies.
 I can use org-roam-dailies-goto-yesterday without a problem but as soon as I want to go back e.g. 3 days, day per day org-roam-dailies-goto-previous-node is very convenient.
 I am in the today's daily file and try to use this function but the message I get is "Not in a daily-note". The behavior is the same for org-roam-dailies-goto-next-node or org-roam-dailies-find-next-node (and so on).
 It seems like (org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p) is nil if I excute it as lisp function in todays org-roam-daily buffer/file.
 I have no clue how I can resolve this.
 Anyone having the same problems or any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr so am looking for a way-in to all the syntax highlighting and magit goodness emacs offers for my non-org-mode uses.
 edit - I use doom by the way
 I'm a org +roam2 user, but I find myself doing more and more "coding" these days.
 I always intend to use emacs / magit etc for code projects, but find myself getting bewidered and end up using something else.
 As a non-dev I'm unfamiliar with the terms used in emacs-world.
 My experiences so far:
 1 Previously I've managed to tramp in to my headless Pi from emacs to edit my Home Assistant .yaml file - but have even stopped doing that because of the loooooong command I need to type (I have never worked out how to paste it - or do some lisp magic) to make it work. 
 2 I looked into Python (Anki Vector SDK) but ended up confused and went back to nano / Mu (via Windows);
 3 I also looked into Arduino (c++) but ended up confused about interfacing with the microcontroller itself, so went back to Arduino IDE (Windows);
 4 I had a platformIO project (Gaggiauino - STM32 Blackpill). I couldn't fathom platformIO in emacs, fell back on VSCode on linux (which threw a bunch of errors) and ended up using VSCode in Windows.
 I may be wrong, but I feel if I can start just one project in emacs (probably editing something on a remote machine) then everything will click?
 Any tips on where to begin?

Yes.

Right. I want the bugs to be fixed but I also want to get other things done.
  
Is it because you also want to get other things done that you came to me?
  
Yes. Emacs stops me from getting other things done.

No, maybe it's just me. Maybe I need to... stop configuring Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know there is a ton of discussion around this but i'm not sure i've found my "perfect" solution yet. Maybe some of can weigh in on which path is "worth" following.
 Basically, i come from vim and neovim. I've worked with emas and neovim in parallel for years now. I generally enjoy the "regular" emacs keybindings for UI stuff. But i feel like i'm lossing a LOT of editing power when leaving evil behind. Yet, getting it to work consistently is a bunch of work and it'll always be 99% at best.
 Now the relevant part. I'm pretty sure i've only scratched the surface of emacs native keybinds. What i find missing is "simple" stuff like "delete between paranthesis" or "duplicate this line". Is this something emacs can "just do" and i just haven't found it yet?
 I see 2 ways forward:
  
Stick with evil and invest the time to create consistent remaps where evil-collection and others don't quite do it.
 Stick to emacs and remap/write functionality i'm missing from vim
  
Note that ergonomics are a secondary thought. I have a custom keyboard so arrow keys are still on hjkl and modifiers are on thumbkeys. I'm also not married to the idea of modal editing. In fact, i enjoy not having to worry about modes and just "type away". But deleting/changing a specified area is just something i haven't found a good solution in emacs to.
 So, thoughts? Is what i'm missing from emacs just there and i need to find it, or am i better of investing fully into evil and making that work?

 But when I put the buffer into column mode, those settings lines are messing up my view of things; in particular they are creating a gap between column view's column headers, and the various column-ized headings down below in the buffer proper.
 Is there a way to hide all that settings cruft so I get a cleaner view in column mode? (Actually, it would be nice to be able to hide it at all times, but it's worst in column mode).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[nothunks-0.2.0 is available on Hackage. The new version can point out exact location of unwanted thunks (which could lead to space leaks), e.g. haskell ThunkInfo { thunkInfo = Right "fromModel :: Int @ test/Test/NoThunks/Class.hs:198:53-84" }  This is only supported when compiling with ghc-9.4 or newer (although the feature needed to support it is available since ghc-9.2), and requires -finfo-table-map (if -fdistinct-constructor-tables is added the location information will be more precise, and thus it's recommended for debugging space leaks with nothunks).
 When info tables are not available the type context is available, which was supported in earlier versions.
 The new version also includes a few more instances of some data types exposed by base package, e.g. various semigroup & monoid newtype wrappers and the Solo data type.
 I would like to thank IOG for supporting this work and colleagues from Well-Typed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am working on small mode for editing pal files, which is a poor-man calendar agenda.
 Everything is more-less done, and almost ready to write a blog about it, but I am facing the problem with faces.
 Problem: custom defined faces are not displaying (at all).
 My definitions:
 (defface pal-todo-face '((t (:foreground "orange red"))) "Face for word TODO") (font-lock-add-keywords 'pal-mode '(("TODO" . 'pal-todo-face))) (add-hook 'pal-mode-hook (lambda () (font-lock-mode 1))) (defun pal-mode-set-face () "Set the face function for pal-mode." (setq-local font-lock-defaults '(pal-mode-font-lock-keywords))) (add-hook 'pal-mode-hook 'pal-mode-set-face) 
 Where pal-mode is defined as:
 (defun pal-mode () "Major mode for editing pal files" (interactive) (setq major-mode 'pal-mode mode-name "Pal")) 
 I use a similar approach to define custom faces for tcl-mode and other extensions. There it works.... 
 Where could be the snag here?
 Thanks for any idea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To follow up on my previous demo of text editing, I have a new demo on using LLMs to manipulate org-mode in a structured way.
 This shows using LLMs to produce JSON, which I then turn into both subheadings in the first part of the demo, and task estimates in the last part. This is part of an effort I'm making to find a good way to support more complicated LLM interactions than we've seen so far. This one isn't just showing the ability to get structured output, but also the ability to refine the previous results as part of a "conversation" with the LLM that started in the first interaction. I haven't seen these things being done before, but I may be missing something. The details and code links can be found in https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-01/msg01134.html.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I'm Binny, originally from India but currently living in Lisbon. I'm a Software Engineer(web dev, full stack) by profession.
I discovered Zettelkasten in 2020 when I started working on a rather large personal project called MindOS. I was trying to create content in the intersection of philosophy, psychology, programming and rationality. During the research phase, I understood that it was going to be impossible to keep all of this in my mind - even with the note taking method that I used at that stage. I needed a better system.
This search led me to Zettelkasten, and I immediately fell in love with it! Since then I have actively trying to encourage others to use it as well. To do this, I have written tutorials, videos, created a couple of tools, etc. But my biggest and most resent contribution is a book I wrote and published a few months back: Zettelkasten and the Art of Knowledge Management.
My Zettelkasten Process...
I have 2 vaults. Everything I learn that is useful for others go into Obsidian - and I publish it as a Digital Garden at https://notes.binnyva.com
All my personal information goes into a Logseq graph. This includes...

 The thing that is confounding me right now is how to extract the value of the point. 
 (with-eval-after-load 'org-capture (require 'doct) (setq org-capture-templates (doct `(("Markdown Capture" :keys "c" :type plain :file ,#'(lambda () (find-a-markdown-file-for-capture "Capture into: ")) :function ,#'(lambda ()) ;; should set point in file appropriately, but how? :empty-lines-before 1 :template "# %?")))) 
 I've been exploring adapting imenu, since markdown-mode supports it and it seems to do 90% what I want to do, but I'm stuck at actually extracting the point and giving it to org-capture.
 Is there something I'm missing? Is there a better way to do this?

 I need your help/guidance on adapting to Emacs.
 Since 2011, I'm was a full-time macOS user, until some months ago when I decided to stop supporting companies like Apple and brought a new PC and putted NixOS on it; I'm still using macOS for my day job, the company doesn't allow me to use Linux. This was the moment where I put myself in trouble.
 Firstly, I was really productive on macOS and using the CMD key in combination with the arrows to move around on the line, quickly select and all of that. These are the moves that I'm missing more on, coming back to Linux. The need to use a Home and End key to do the same thing is killing my productivity, mainly due to the fact there is no dedicated key to do that on my laptop keyboard or on the Keychron K6.
 On my Mac I used to use VS…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I finally picked Scala 3 for my new product and I'd like to share some experience. Overall, it's a tool for reservations. Involves a bunch of CRUD. Nothing special or particularly challenging. The stack was classic "spartan": Tapir, ZIO, Quill, Circe, Cats...
 The good:
 Tapir folks nailed it! That's pretty much all I can say about them. ZIO also worked flawlessly. Quill was a pleasant surprise since it was the spot where I expected most of the obstacles. Although, the general documentation of Quill could be improved. E.g. in the context of structure, more examples, etc. But in all fairness, well done.
 The bad:
 Some things do not work quite well with new Scala features. E.g. a lot of hacking around various encoders and decoders for opaque types or enums. Some libraries are still not supported which is bonkers. E.g. I miss Scalamock and Cornichon.
 The ugly:
 Tooling. The neverending story... Let's begin with Metals. Metals is like a... musket. Sometimes it fires, sometimes it misfires, and sometimes explodes straight to your face. In a lot of cases, I had to kill its Java process, remove the target dir., and reimport the project. Funny enough, IntelliJ worked okish. With, few error reports when there are no actual errors. However, the experience is kind of clunkier than with Scala 2. Also, I noticed that sometimes incremental compilation doesn't work quite well and you can end up with some weird behavior.
 The unnecessary: 
 Indentation syntax. I don't want to start a rant... especially if I start asking questions about how much time and resources this feature required. Especially, since Scala has much greater "burning issues". In all fairness, I didn't see any benefit from having this.
 To conclude: 
 The experience was ok, spiced with some rough edges. From a Scala beginner's perspective, I presume it would be quite nasty. Overall, there's still a lot of work to do.

 I am doing some exercises on cses and getting stuck at this problem, https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1084. Here is my code, it works correctly but always produces TIME LIMIT EXCEEDED errors,
 ```haskell module Main (main) where
 import Data.List
 type Range = (Int, Int)
 merge :: [Int] -> [Range] -> Int merge [] _ = 0 merge _ [] = 0 merge xs@(x:xs') ys@((lower, upper) : ys') | x < lower = merge xs' ys | upper < x = merge xs ys' | otherwise = 1 + merge xs' ys'
 getList :: IO [Int] getList = map read . words <$> getLine
 main :: IO () main = do [,,k] <- getList xs <- sort <$> getList ys <- map (\y -> (y-k, y+k)) . sort <$> getList print $ merge xs ys
 ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probably it's been asked many times, still, I'm not sure which way should I go.
 I'm hungarian, and my solution to write hungarian in emacs (which I have barely done) was that I just simply typed "auoeiuo" instead of "áúüű....".
 Lately I started to have the need to write text for others, so using the correct vowels with "umlauts" became needed more and more often. It would be amazing if I could just simply switch layout and go on with my life not fighting with my muscle memory. Most often I still use us layout, not only because of the shortcuts, but also typing special characters like \, [], etc... on hungarian layout really a pain in the ass. On hungarian layout I will almost never use any "programming characters", I'm pretty sure.
 The problem I have for example is that "C-_" is "C-Ü" or "C-y" is "C-z" on hungarian layout, which doesn't work anymore. I don't want to learn different combinations, neither fighting my muscle memory every time when once a week I want to write some longer hungarian text in emacs.
 I have a feeling that there could be a trick that any time i'm using a different layout, (and probably I should also put a condition that I'm in txt mode for not mess up things like dired or magit), emacs would interpret my keystrokes differently when I hold down C or M. So I would use the same key for typing a single "ü" and "C-_" for example.
 What could be the simplest way to set up emacs like that? Can you post me a link where it's already answered? I'm pretty sure it's been answered a couple of times, I'm just too stupid to find it.
 Thank you!

 Failed to request slack-authorize: invalid_auth 
 I've included slack in my dotspacemacs-configuration-layers, and here is what I have in my dotspacemacs/user-config (with personal parts redacted): 
  (slack-register-team :name "emacs-slack" :default t :client-id "xxx@xxx.com" :client-secret "xoxd-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" :token "xoxc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" :subscribed-channels '(general slackbot)) 
 I got the client-secret and token by following the direction in the emacs-slack package (as directed by the spacemacs slack layer documentation). 
 There does seem to be some differences in nomenclature between the spacemacs layer and emacs-slack, maybe I'm entering the wrong thing? And the instructions for the spacemacs layer doesn't go into enough detail. Is name suppose to be the name of the slack team I use? Is client-secret the same as the d cookie from the emacs-slack instructions or is it my password? 
 If someone has it working could you provide a copy of your user-config entry (with the personal stuff redacted of course, but not so much that I can't tell if I'm doing it right or wrong.) and maybe some details about each of the items?
 It does seem that emacs-slack isn't under development any more, maybe it just doesn't work anymore?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 This is part of my effort to replace my three TiddlyWiki instances with org files. I've looked at a number of conversion tools written by others, and ended up rolling a small(-ish) Perl script to do about 90% of the conversion, from a JSON export of a given TW instance.
 The first TW instance I've converted is a journal of my scale modeling projects. In it, I have future projects, current projects, and completed projects. I would like it if the completed projects (all of which have a tag "Completed" on their level-1 headline) were folded. I read in the manual that adding :VISIBILITY: folded to the properties drawer would do this, but it didn't work for me. And, as I already have a tag unique to these headlines, it would be great if I could trigger this based on the tag.
 Is there a way to run elisp code when an org file is first opened, specific to a file, with which I could do this? I suppose it could be done with a hook, but I would likely want code to be specific to a given file. (That is, I might have a similar-but-different need in the other files I'm yet to convert.)
 Thanks!

 so i have this in my doom emacs org mode setup which make the headings a bit bigger then other stuff emacs-lisp (with-eval-after-load 'org (dolist (face '((org-level-1 . 1.3) (org-level-2 . 1.2) (org-level-3 . 1.1) (org-level-4 . 1.05) (org-level-5 . 1.1) (org-level-6 . 1.1) (org-level-7 . 1.1) (org-level-8 . 1.1))) (set-face-attribute (car face) nil :weight 'bold :height (cdr face)))) 
 but when i enter the org-columns view it is a complete mess as i have variable pitch and visual-fill-columns mode enabled , the big font size in org-columns headings flow to more then one line and different heading levels are indented differently due to their different font size.
 what i want in theory
 is to toggle the enlarged heights of the headings temporarily while in org-columns mode to normal settings and then toggle back when i leave the org-columns 
 is it possible in emacs? or is it something else that i need but i dont know about it

Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
I'm looking at the high switching costs of how I've set up my ZK. It seems I've boxed myself in with some basic decisions about file naming and linking conventions.
Young Adult Literature as a genre ripe for literary criticism.
Uni Class has started, so I'm finding most of my thinking is slanted toward Young Adult Literature.
Things I'm reading:
Gratz, Alan. Refugee. 2017.
Tucci, Stanley. Taste: my life through food. 2021.
Gantos, Jack. Dead end in Norvelt. 2013.
Picard, Max. The world of silence. 1948.
Music I'm listening to:
House Music to zettelkast with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When typing up some long-form text for entry into a website, I'll sometimes do it first in Org mode and then once I'm happy with it I'll copy-paste it into whatever I'm using. 
 However, one issue is that of <NEWLINE>.
 On the one hand, web forms often want to handle line wrapping, and so it wants the user to insert <NEWLINE> characters only if really necessary; e.g. for between paragraphs, list items, and so on.
 But on the other hand, I have Org set up to auto-fill text input (and I'll also regularly give it a hand in that using M-q to run org-fill-paragraph), so I end up with <NEWLINE> characters all over the place.
 Now obviously I could just turn off emacs and Org's auto-fill for the purpose of these situations. But I don't want that. I actually *want* the Org text formatted with the auto-fills, just as it would be if I wasn't creating something for input on the web.
 So, is there a simple way (maybe using export? ) to have the newlines that are not needed (I'm thinking it's only newlines within a paragraph) replaced with what is almost certainly going to be a simple inter-word space? Note , though, that it isn't just going to be the newline that needs to go, but also any following indenting whitespace characters used to correctly position the next piece of text.
 For example, I'd like to have this:
  1. A line of text 2. Another line of text but this one is long enough to need to be wrapped. And notice that this portion is indented.  converted to:  1. A line of text 2. Another line of text but this one is long enough to need to be wrapped. And notice that this portion is indented.

 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version in a couple of weeks.
 I would to like thank Théophile Batoz. His sustained efforts cleared a long-standing issue and Stack can now build packages with dependencies on public sub-libraries of other packages.
 Release notes:
  
After an upgrade from an earlier version of Stack, on first use only, Stack 2.15.1 may warn that it had trouble loading the CompilerPaths cache.
 The hash used as a key for Stack’s pre-compiled package cache has changed, following the dropping of support for Cabal versions older than 1.24.0.0.

 From memory, I started with the first and switched to the second when the first stopped working with yt-dlp. Regardless, there are several new features I would like to add to my Emacs-based download workflow (ex: logging).
 If there is anyone who has strong feelings about merits and demerits of the two I would appreciate your input before I invest in extending/forking one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I've been trying for the past month or so to get Emacs working reliably and quickly on my High DPI linux machines, but have been struggling.
 Currently I am running into issues with a machine running Manjaro + GNOME (wayland) and the pgtk version of emacs 29.1. When I scale the frame to take up the entirety of my 4k display, I have noticeable input lag, likely in the 100s of ms. When I shrink the frame down, my input lag decreases significantly, and emacs feels snappy. The issue persists when I run emacs with emacs -q.
 At the moment I've resorted to running emacs 29.1 without pgtk, forcing it to run under XWayland. This causes emacs to render at a lower resolution to XWayland, resulting in blurry text when it's finally displayed on my monitor, but results in emacs staying snappy even at full screen.
 I've run into this issue across all my machines, across distros (namely Void, Arch, and Fedora), whenever I try to run Emacs full screen on a 4K monitor attached to a machine running Wayland. Switching to X isn't an option due to the excessive screen tearing that I get at high resolutions.
 Weirdly, compiling and running Emacs on my Windows work machine natively results in the best emacs experience I've had so far, with input feeling extremely snappy and fluid. I don't experience the scaling issues there. Emacs also is working fantastic on an old low resolution laptop that I have running Void with XFCE.
 I've tried adjusting the double buffering as mentioned in this post without success: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/zgp6kw/gui_emacs_weird_the_bigger_the_frame_size_is_the/
 Any thoughts? Is this a thing that people are running into on high resolution displays with Wayland? Is XWayland the best bet right now?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am starting a company and I love developing with Scala. I feel way more confident about my apps when built with Scala, they end up being a lot less buggy and generally easier to understand. My cofounder is used to Python, he’s been coding in Python for like 15 years (I have too) but I also have used JS and Scala in my career. Two jobs ago I only used Scala and my most recent job was only Python. The transition back to Python from Scala was so disappointing. I HATED it. Everything felt so sloppy and disorganized. 
 My co-founder has only ever used Python. He’s extremely resistant to learning Scala. he feels very certain we should be using Python for all of our backend services because it’s easier, there are more libraries and it will be easier to hire devs in the future. 
 Anyone have any advice or opinions on this? Is it unreasonable for me to continue to convince him to use Scala? Am I being too opinionated about what stack we should be using?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I don't live my life in Emacs, but I have come to the conclusion that Emacs plugins are often among the best tools for doing the particular job they do.
 I need to manage my contacts with an extensible tool. Availability is a must - they have to be sync-able on all my devices with ease. Ease of backing them up is also very important to me. Integration with Emacs mail clients is also very important. I don't use an Emacs mua at the moment, but I plan on using notmuch.
 I have come across this post on the subreddit. Right now, it seems to me like bbdb or ebdb are options that would suit my needs, but I have doubts. I know people in the Emacs community are very vocal about how great various features/packages are (and why everything is better in Emacs), but I haven't really found content on managing contacts with Emacs.
 Is there a general favorite of the community in regards to contact-management packages? How come nobody really talks about this? Is it better to do this outside of Emacs? Thank you!

 Recently I discovered denote, a young and excellent package to organize notes in files, and I have to say that I'm really enjoying it. However, it requires me to reorganize my long org file (which is good, after so many years growing out of control).
 I would like to ask, first of all, somebody with similar experiences, why did you decided to switch to denote? Or to stay with a long org file?
 The long org file works for me in a way that I simply come to the file and search for a particular word, so I can easily access all the results and choose the one I want. I don't even use tags, everything is organized in sectons using headers. How do you make that search easy in denote? I know that using keywords is the best but, assuming that sometimes you are not even 100% sure about the exact word that you need and you type in a few to try.
 On the other hand, small files work better for my mobile (where I sync my notes), specially with zettel notes app, which has similar organization than denote. However, I wonder if somebody has a good experience with a long org file with some particular app for android.
 I'm still trying to decide if switching to denote or staying with my long org file. Any comments would be appreciated.

I've been using org-mode for note-taking, and I'm also learning e lisp introduction guide in Emacs, I'm trying to set up org-indent-mode to enable when I'm in normal mode and disable when I'm in insert mode. So I could read my note more clearly.
 I came across a code snippet on EmacsWiki that changes the mode line color based on the Evil state, but I'm having trouble understanding and adapting it for org-indent-mode. 
 So I wrote this code to achieve this
 (defun escape () "Change org-indent-mode based on evil state" (interactive) (if (evil-normal-state-p) (org-indent-mode 1) (org-indent-mode -1))) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'escape) 
 It work when I type M-x escape , I know the problem but i don't know to solve it, the problem i think is it is checking for first time and but not observing the change in state.
 I really appreciate any help 💖

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Org for repeating meeting notes for several years. My workflow
 is something like:
  
for each person I regularly meet I have a top level bullet.
 every time I have a meeting with that person, I find the top level bullet, and create a new child bullet, with the date of the meeting and the topic - I have two usual topica, being "catch up" and"review".
 under that new bullet I type my notes from the meeting. These are usually transcribed from paper notes I make during the meeting.
  
E.g
 * Ann Onymous
 ** <2023-08-22 Thu> catchup
 Ann is having fun working on cold-fusion. Needs new peanut butter and
 mousetraps. Says warm weather is interfering with correct function of
 reverse osmosis proton macerator.
 Needs me to sort out climate and mousetraps.
 ** <2023-09-20 Wed> catchup
 new mousetraps have made life better. Climate still not good enough...
 ​
 Having watched (in bits, over a week or two admiteddly) Prot's 'tube explanations, and done a basic installation of Denote, I want to make it work for my note taking needs. I'm in no way wedded to the arrangement shown above. I'd happily have a file per person. But I think Denote wants me to have a file per meeting. But for me, a big part of the value is continuity. I.e. being able to see what happened in previous meetings so I can be sure to follow up on actions, and keep a proxixmate record of outstanding actions and conclusions.
 I think this means that I might use Denote by having a file per meeting, with keywords like "talking_to_Ann_Onymous" and then use a dynamic block to gather the rolling textual status. By playing with the frontmatter I could include the date of each meeting. Further, I think I would use the signature fucntions to ensure that the notes are displayed in calendar order.
 Has someone else solved this kind of problem? Did you find a better way to handle this kind of note taking?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m wondering if there is some roadmap, or blog posts devoted to the future of the Scala language. I was looking through Rust's blog posts and the Rust team does an amazing job describing “what’s next” for the language. In addition to that, there are a lot of blog posts from core language contributors that also give a view on the language evolution which is pretty cool. I could not find any of that for Scala. I read periodically Scala Contributors but it’s more like the discussion of potential improvements and separate proposals. Before 3.3.0 it was stabilization and road to LTS. But now it’s not that clear. 
 It would be nice to have periodical blog posts related to the future of the language and the vision of language designers, a road map that is periodically updated. 
 Not the list of new features (we’re adding this because <lang X> has it), but why these features are important, how they will affect language, etc.

 So I'm setting up evil mode and so far it works pretty well for me. The only thing that doesn't really fit what I'm used to is actions that span multiple lines. The starting and ending lines are not included completely in this action but only from (and on the ending line up to) the position of the cursor. 
 If I had this text ([x] is the cursor position):
  This is[x] a test line Another line to test 
 and then do dj I would end up with this result
  This is line to test 
 I would expect it to just delete both lines. What do I need to configure to get the desired behaviour? The current behaviour is active for all commands that can span multiple lines like yank, delete and so on

As i see i have 3 options: 1) for each minibuffer mode i use to bind <escape> to minibuffer-keyboard-quit, 2) for each to remap keyboard-quit to minibuffer-keyboard-quit, 3) to remap for all minibuffer modes.
 How can do 3?
  
Also, side question. Why don't more packages simply rebind existing (fundamental) functions instead of invent/make us bind new keys?
 I am exploring vertigo/consult (currently ivy/counsel user) and it striked me how friendly transition to vertgo was in terms of keys. I have to learn nothing new, all keys are intuitive. Vertigo simply remaps fundamental functions to vertigo functions. Screenshot - https://imgur.com/a/isc9iYv
 Why don't more packages do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background to the problem.
 I use the GUI form designer on Lazarus which saves changes to the form to a text file and in manipulating the form elements, spurious changes are made that I don't want.
 For instance if a form is moved around the screen during the edits, the top and left positions of the form are saved to the file even if they are not relevant to the task. Adjusting the size of an element to gain access to some other elements also result in spurios changes.
 Is there some way to revert those changes from the Magit diff view and only commit those desired?
 I know how to stage and commit tht hunks I need but I also need to revert the unwanted uncommitted changes in the working copy.
 Logically I can commit only the changes I want and check the file out again to restore the unwanted changes back to their original setting, but that applies to files containing hunks I have no use for.
 BONUS INFO
 After a bit of searching around I have realized that in addition to Magit there are quite a few package that provide the same functionality, two of those I already have installed.
  
diff-hl
 git-undo
 git-gutter-plus
 git-gutter
  
Searching for stuff is difficult when you don't know or can't recollect the right terminology. All I had to do was to enter C-h f - hunk and their commands would have showed up.

 Currently I have all my case classes and functions, and main in an object file, which is src>main>scala>example>main.scala
 I put the CSVs i’m working with under src>main>resources
 How do i organize my code? Am i supposed to put my case classes functions in another object file? Would be great to know your thoughts on this

 So without any recourse, since the variable is defined using 'defconst` as opposed to `defcustom' and `setq` wouldnt work - I had to patch the source in ox-latex.el as

 I hope this change is undone as it proved to be a source of my many miseries and many more that will have a rather rude awakening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a feeling there must be a package for this kind of thing but I don't even know what I would use as a search string and I'm getting :side-eye from the LLMs atm... 
 There are languages which have CLI tooling to automate the dev+test loop. As an example from Rust there is: 
 cargo watch 
 which will watch the directory for file changes and automatically run tests when a file changes. 
 There are other languages/tools which don't have that sort of thing (or for which the tooling is just getting going). As an example, here's a much simplified version of what I do in the shell for Terraform: 
 while true; do fsnotifywait -r -e close_write . ; terraform plan && terraform apply -auto-approve ; sleep 2; done 
 There must be an Emacs package which combines the ability to watch a directory for changes and then automatically execute a pipeline like the above, yes? 
 NOTE: Emacs LSP is fine for fmt and lint in most cases I've encountered. Also, yes, there is better tooling for automated testing in TF now. Like I said, that loop is much simplified.
  
EDIT: Interestingly, here's what I eventually managed to get out of an LLM for non-elisp tools perhaps reachable via an Emacs package:
  
 Tool Name Language Written In Recursive Watch Support Config File Support in Work Directory Latest Release Date Emacs Package Available 
  
 inotify-tools C Yes No Sep 12, 2023 No 
  fswatch C++ Yes No Jul 1, 2023 No 
  Watchman C++ Yes Yes Jan 22, 2024 Yes (emacs-watchman) 
  entr C No No Not available No 
  nodemon JavaScript Yes Yes Jan 16, 2024 No 
  Git Hooks Various (Shell, Python, etc.) Not Applicable Yes (via scripts) Not applicable Not directly, but can be used with Emacs 
  watchexec Rust Yes No Jan 5, 2024 No

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of orgs big strengths is its ability to emit code. I use org-tangle for my literate emacs config, org-export for producing PDFs and HTML, and a variation of org-export MD for producing my Hugo blog posts. But I am unconfident about when org will skip lines. Is my understanding correct?
  
 It seems that timestamps, including inactive timestamps, and DEADLINE and SCHEDULED are ALWAYS output. I wish this weren't so.
  When tangling, COMMENT on a heading (shortcut key #) is skipped. I don't know if this omits things from org-agenda.
  When marked with :ARCHIVE:, lines are skipped in org-agenda. I use this for optimizing long repeating sequences so that I only have one chunk (month, or school semester) at a time.
  DEADLINES can have their visibility shortened with syntax like <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp"><2024-01-25 Thu -2d></span></span>; however, the same seems to break stuff if put into SCHEDULED instead.
 
Traditional syntax commenting with literal =# = at line start in an org file omits from all of the above, I think. But I'm not sure.
 Is this as confusing as I see, or is there a unifying principle here?

 Below are my lsp-mode config and my company config. When I use lsp mode with pyright on python files I get completions almost immediately upon typing. There is virtually no delay that I can even notice but when I use lsp mode with rust-analyzer on a rust file, the completion never pops up no matter what I do. I have tried reinstalling rust-analyzer, restarting lsp-mode, restarting company mode and nothing changes. Anybody had experience with this before?

 I have all my projects under ~/Documents/projects. In Emacs I ran projectile-discover-projects-in-directory and then in the input (not sure what Emacs people call it?) I entered the path ~/Documents/projects, the first time I ran it, it actually did something, took about 10 seconds. It probably indexed those projects. But if I try to switch projects, no projects show.
 I'm still quite new to Emacs, so I attempted to run the function in my config.
 (setq org-directory "~/org/" projectile-project-search-path '("~/Documents/projects/")) 
 But it also doesn't work...
 As I said, still quite new to Emacs, so I don't know how to check for Error messages, the *Messages* buffer is empty tho.

 Edit: Projects are all git repos.

 What i want to achieve is to have main font for buffer around height 11-12, and org tables height 10.
 Problem right now org table face seem to take minimal line height from main font seize disregarding their font size. So they are a bit heigher than they should be.
 Screenshots:
 main font 10, org table face 10 https://imgur.com/a/hntoqNS (rows are ideal height)
 main font 10.5, org table face 10 https://imgur.com/a/qvxOeI9 (rows are a bit heigher than optimal)
 main font 30, org table face 10 https://imgur.com/a/8u3PAWL (rows ... you can tell :) there is no extra linese here - it's a 3 row table)
 Is this how it supposed to work, or did i mess something up? I swear before update to emacs 29 / org 9.6.6 rows had line height 10 (not 10.5) with my normal set up of main font 10.5. But maybe it was always like this...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I want to write some rules representing rewrites for s-expressions:
 ``` data Pattern = Var String | Fn String [Pattern]
 data Rule = Rule Pattern Pattern
 -- (f ?a 1) ==> (g ?a) rule = Rule (Fn "f" [Var "a", Fn "1" []]) (Fn "g" [Var "a"]) -- Invalid rule: (f ?a 1) ==> (g ?b) invalidRule = Rule (Fn "f" [Var "a", Fn "1" []]) (Fn "g" [Var "b"]) ```
 Informally, if an expressions "matches" the LHS, this binds each pattern variable to an expression, and then we substitute these into the RHS.
 The problem is that this representation doesn't prevent me from writing invalid rules. In particular, I'd like to prevent variable binding issues: I'd like to enforce that all pattern variables that appear on the right hand side must appear on the left hand side. (It's fine for variables to appear multiple times in a pattern.) Is there a way to do this? Maybe with some HOAS approach?

 When developing React projects, I often stumble over something called "Styled Components", which are altered ReactJS components with CSS applied to it. It looks like this:
 export const AssetColumnHeader = styled(Div)` display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: flex-start; font-family: ${({ theme }) => theme.fonts.primary}; color: ${({ theme }) => theme.colors[theme.textColors.primary.color][ theme.textColors.primary.intensity ]}; strong { font-weight: 600; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; } `; 
 My major mode is typescript-ts-mode.
 I'd like to have "css-ts-mode" inside the space delimited by `...` (backticks). With the exception of ${ ... }, which is Javascript/Typescript (also typescript-ts-mode).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm relatively new to Emacs (28) and spent the holidays configuring it to be a nice environment for machine learning applications and writing Latex/org-mode markup. Loving it so far.
 However, one thing I wish I could change is the major modes for C, C++, Python, and Shell languages. I tend to get really overwhelmed by how many options are provided because of the maturity of these languages and it's hard for me to really learn their features even with which-key installed. Another sticking point is that they sometimes overwrite custom keybinds that I use frequently, especially c-mode.
 Is there such a thing as a general purpose coding major mode that just provides syntax highlighting with tree-sitter, code folding, and Eldoc info for each language? Maybe this is something that would be easy to hack up by extending prog-mode with only those features?
 Barring that, is there a way to help simplify the major modes like not overriding my global keymap? I have a difficult time with mental context switching and want to only need to think about my basic keybinds and org stuff.

I am creating a growing list of the benefits of the Zettelkasten Method. This is in itself neither new nor exciting, since it would be a repetition of the marketing babble already existing in the domain of knowledge management.
My take will be to highlight the steps of the causal mechanism how the benefit is created. There is a lot of talk about that the Zettelkasten gives you a certain set of benefits, sometimes a blurry idea of the how. There is a lack of explicitness and precision. This is what I am going for.
So, my request is for you: Give me every benefit you can think of. Being it a benefit that you want to be justified or rejected. Being it a benefit that you experienced. Being a benefit that other's claim and you are not sure about.
GIVE ME EVERYTHING!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been religiously working on a migration from Play 2.12 to 2.13 and since Play iteratees are no longer available in 2.13 I used Akka streaming. Somehow after a lot of effort, I made it work but then I was looking at this article: https://www.lightbend.com/akka/license-faq which made my heart skip a beat. Since Akka had super powerful capabilities, especially for concurrent apps is this end for scala? Are the older functionalities like Akka streaming and all still under Apache 2.0 or they would also be affected by this? Any alternatives for all this?
 I know what Akka is requesting makes sense but I can't convince my business owners to get one license. They are instead insisting me to migrate to some other microservice or framework. :/
