 I'd kind of like to use it for more text things, but one thing that I'm not sure how to do is maybe fire up a frame that only has access to txt/org files and won't be cross-contaminated by all the code buffers I have open. Is there a good way to have a frame/window be dedicated to a type of file?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I installed Haskell using stack. I seemed to have a system-wide install that has ghc as version 9.0.2 from a terminal prompt in any directory. Then I created projects with
 stack new projname stack setup stack build 
 So I just installed ghcup according to the instructions and did ghcup tui where I chose ghc 9.4.8. But now ghc --version reports 9.0.2 -- as if it doesn't know about my ghcup choice. I do ghcup set ghc 9.4.8 -- and again ghc --version still gives 9.0.2. I fear I'm messing things up. How can I get my Haskell world totally into ghcup and out of stack? The ghcup set ghc did say /usr/bin/ghc is "shadowing" and I should remove it. Will this solve this issue entirely, or is my previous stack world going to linger and cause more problems? I see in /usr/bin a cabal and cabal --version and which cabal yields, yes, /usr/bin/cabal and this not the ghcup cabal. Remove it too? What else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I run emacs (GNU Emacs 26.1 (build 1, x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.22.30)), I get a bunch of warnings like this:
  
(emacs:870588): Gtk-WARNING **: 17:46:44.937: Theme parsing error: gtk.css:978:50: Missing closing bracket for :not()
  
I do have a gtk.css file in .config/gtk-3.0, but it just imports a colors.css file - and that file just calls @define-color a bunch of times. And I tried commenting out the import - didn't help.
 The default theme seems to be HighContrast, so I checked its gtk-3.0/gtk.css and there's nothing it in. Could the problem being coming from another theme?
 It's not a huge problem, but these warnings fill up my terminal. I can keep two terminals open to the same directory so I can see what I'm doing, but I was wondering if there's any way to suppress this stuff.
 Here's what I've tried:
  
I got rid of my .emacs file.
 I created a configuration file (~/.emacs.d/early-init.el) containing:
  
 (setq warning-minimum-level :emergency) 
 (setq warning-minimum-log-level :emergency) 
 (load-theme 'leuven' t)
  
The theme takes effect, but the warnings are still there. Is there a global location that could be overriding my configuration? I got pissed and sent the warnings to /dev/null, but that means I can't see any warnings at all - so not the best solution. Any better suggestions?

It's no longer faster than just using a single thread. I've tried monitoring multi-threaded Haskell programs using htop, and I think the problem is that they're not using the setpriority system call to get a high enough priority. 
 ​
 I can't find any information on how to set the thread priority for the latest version of ghc (9.8.2), and I still haven't gotten a follow up on any bug reports I've made.

 I would like a function to call that could create that link from an org headline that I could yank (paste) elsewhere in the file.

 Additionally, if possible, I would like to learn how I would figure this out on my own for future ideas.

 ​
 I have two methods like following
 def doSomething(input: model1): model2 = {
 ......
 }
 ​
 def doSomething2(input: model3): model4 = {
 ....
 }
 ​
 doSomething() and doSomething2() are doing the same thing. So, i thought of passing the type as parameter and came up with the following
 ​
 def doSomethingGood[A, B] (input: A): B = {
 ...
 return value.asInstanceOf[B] //--->Is this good?
 }
 Now the issue is i have to cast the return value to B, is this good practice? Is there any better way to refactor it?

 I am asking about a snippet/package because simply having the property :VISIBILITY: folded` as described in the org-manual, like below, does not work for me. When I re-open the file, all sub-trees are unfolded.:
 * Main ** A - Level 1 *** A - level 2 :properties: :VISIBILITY: folded :end: Lorem ipsum ** B - level 1 *** B - level 2 :properties: :VISIBILITY: folded :end: Lorem ipsum ** C 
 I need to save the folded state in the file itself, using the VISIBILITY property, so that every time I open that file all subfolders have the desired folded/unfolded state.
 It must be something very simple which I am overlooking, any pointers, please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created an emacs extension named org-linker that allows users to link a file in org-mode (the attachment is identified as a UUID), offering a secure and flexible method for referring to other files in org-mode. Try it out!
 Comparison with org-attach
 org-linker differs from org-attach in its approach to file attachment. 
 org-attach uses an org heading as a basic storing unit, which can lead to issues if not managed carefully (e.g. refiling or adding shadowing subtrees). 
 On the other hand, org-linker assigns a unique UUID to each attached file, ensuring a more robust linkage system. By treating individual files as the fundamental unit, org-linker provides a safer and more flexible approach to handling attachments in org-mode documents. For example, this allows easy movement and copying of links across various org files and headings.
 Both tools have their strengths and are suitable for different use cases. However, if you prioritize a secure and straightforward attachment system, org-linker might be the preferred choice.
 Example
 For instance, if the root is /tmp/org-linker/, and the UUID for the transaction is 20240101-235959, and the file is readme.md, the file will be copied to /tmp/org-linker/20240101-235959/readme.md with the transaction recorded in /tmp/org-linker/db.tx. And an org-link [[linker:20240101-235959/readme.md]] is inserted at point.
 You can customize the uuid generator. In particular, you don't have to use timestamp.
 You can also remove the uuid easily by fuzzy searching with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-uuid, or just remove the uuid at point with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-at-point. The trashing function is customizable too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I couldn't find any obvious online resources for this issue I thought I'd write a small post.
 I've been experimenting with turning on mouse mode when using emacs in the terminal via
 (unless window-live system (require 'mouse) (xterm-mouse-mode t) (defun track-mouse (e)) (setq mouse-sel-mode t)) 
 This has some side effects that mess with cutting via the system command-c combination since the mouse selections are managed by emacs rather than my terminal, iterm2. I can live with that but I wanted some kill-ring / system clipboard integration since I do frequently want to cut text from inside emacs and paste outside of it in another app. So I added some advice to do that 
 ​
 ;; Advice to the kill functions that also copies the last kill ring entry to ;; the system clipboard. ;; This is called after the copy so we can ignore parameters. (defun pbcopy-region-filter (begin end &optional region) (let* ((text (current-kill 0)) (process-connection-type nil) (proc (start-process "pbcopy" "*Messages*" "pbcopy"))) (process-send-string proc text) (process-send-eof proc))) ;; For terminal mode add advice to copy to clipboard (unless window-system (advice-add 'kill-region :after #'pbcopy-region-filter) (advice-add 'kill-ring-save :after #'pbcopy-region-filter))

 Turns out there's a different set of colors available on each, even though both are running with xterm-256color. Doing list-colors-display in one gives the list of X11 color names that I expect -- 556 of them -- and in the other there's a list of only 256 colors, the 16 ANSI terminal colors followed by colors numbered 16 to 256.
 I can't find any documentation about this list of numbered colors anywhere, where is it coming from?

 hackage
  
This is being used in production at my work and has provided useful insights around performance bottlenecks, exception context, and overall visibility into code execution.
 The plugin makes it so that you do not need to manually insert instrumentation code into function definitions, improving maintainability and reducing noise. By defining rules in a config file, you can specify which functions to instrument based on their return type or constraint context. This gives you control over whether you want the blanket approach of targeting your application's primary monad/constraint or a more conservative approach of defining a type that explicitly indicates that it will be instrumented.
 A MonadUnliftIO instance must be available for a function to be instrumentable. In particular, pure functions are not eligible.

 It seems to me, from a user perspective, that the c++-mode/c++-ts-mode split is causing a lot of headaches. It may be solving some that I don't know about, but it is frustrating sometimes.

 Everything else renders fonts correctly. I have checked via M-x describe-fontset and it seems to be my font: Fontset: -PfEd-DejaVu Sans Mono-regular-normal-normal-*-16-*-*-*-m-0-fontset-auto2.
 What's weird is this is after restarting emacs, so it's something surviving in the system between restarts. Rebooting my laptop resolves the issue.
 Any ideas where to look to debug this?

 I am considering these 2 versions:
 - Solarized-Dark 
 - Doom-Solarized-Dark
 ​
 I have these questions:
  
Is "Doom-Solarized-Dark" supposed to be better than the ordinary "Solarized-Dark" ? I would like to use the most complete theme and the one that supports more extensions. I don't use Doom Emacs but that's not an impediment to use the doom-solarized-dark theme. Which one is better and which one would you recommend me to use ?
 Solarized theme is a legendary theme, however it seems that has some flaws in its design (at least under my eyes). It is also true that I am not an expert in the topic. I am referring specifically to the fact that, talking about syntax highlighting, there is no color for strings (Font Lock String Face). That is, color for strings and foreground is exactly the same. Does it have any logical explanation ? Is it a flaw at a design level that needs to be improved ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The magit package available on the nongnu elpa is v3.3.0 (https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/magit.html), which requires transient 0.3.6. The stock transient that comes with Emacs 29.2 has the version 0.4.3.
 When magit 3.3.0 is installed, either from nongnu archive or directly from its tar file, it will pull down the latest 0.5.3 from the elpa archive.
 Is there a way to let magit not install transient 0.5.3 but use the built-in 0.4.3, which should satisfy the dependency requirement ?
 Edit: another package, transient-dwim, shows the same issue by pulling the latest transient even though this 2022-year package specifies transient 0.1 as its dependency.
 Solution:
 A temporary workaround until the bug reported by u/nv-elisp is fixed. Put this in init.el:
 (add-to-list 'package--builtin-versions '(transient 0 4 3)) 
 Hope this is helpful and many thanks to all the people who chimed in!

During my studies I started with atom and finally moved to VsCode, using vi/vim/nano/fish/tmux for server managing and quick file modifications.
 I imagine that moving all my dev working routine from VsCode to Emacs is going to be... Hard, specially for the first days but this is the way my future working routine is going to be so... I am really excited and affraid to. I have a few tutorial from YouTube marked as "to watch" but I would like to have your personal experience feedback and your opinion for the usual question: why should I use emacs instead of, for example, VsCode?

 I run the curl command to install ghcup and let install everything including hls.
 Then I run stack new hello to build a neu project. The first thing I noticed is that another GHC version was installed.
 [GHCup-00130] The version 9.6.4 of the tool ghc is not installed.
 It installes GHC 9.6.4, which is neither recommended nor hls-powered
 It also installes HLS 
 If I run stack build I get the next error
 ghc-9.6.4: \gcc' failed in phase `Linker'. (Exit code: 1)`
 And if I open the project in VSCode (with the Haskell extension) I also get errors
 I had trouble figuring out the exact GHC version for the project. Falling back to using 'ghc'.
 Failed to find the GHC version of this Stack project. Error when calling stack --stack-yaml /home/markus/dev/haskell/hello/stack.yaml setup --silent
 What went wrong? Did I miss some steps while installation? Do I need to install something additional on the OS?
 seems that I needed some packages. I installed these, But stack still wants to install a newer version of ghc. Does that matter?

you might have heard it: ChatGPT challenged me and my honour. Let's see if I can keep it, or bow down in shame.
Here is a 100% authenticated record of a conversation I had yesterday (what a coincidence):

  
LUHMANN: What is best in life?


See this thread for full context: https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2837/gpt4-zettel-critique-assistant-robo-zettel-feedback
The idea is to compare the feedback of ChatGPT and me. So, we need notes. 2--3 are enough. The content needs to be accessible to me. So, I cannot deal with mathematical content software code. Also: Really intricate details in specific domains might be out of reach. However, I have broad knowledge in the basics of most domains. So, just give it a try.
Please, submit notes for this battle.
Live long and prosper

 denote-silo-extras-open-or-create
 denote-silo-extras-select-silo-then-command
 [ As part of 3.0.0-dev, we fixed an issue where a C-u prefix argument was needed to select a silo. ]
 I am aware that the top two functions currently still need the C-u prefix fix to correctly let you select silos (since I'm still on denote 2.2.4) Aside from this, I'm still running into two problems:
  
whenever i enter my silo in dired it always prompts me about the local variables list in my silo or .dir-locals.el containing values that may not be safe (*) and asking me to perform the action of ignoring it or applying the local variable list. But even after i choose the ! to permanetly mark these values as safe, the effect only lasts for that session and the next time I start up emacs and dired into that directory, it ends up asking me again.
 the three denote-silo-extras functions (aside from the C-u prefix issue on 2.2.4 which will be fixed in 3.0), all three of these functions when used don't seem to pick up on my silo's local variable denote-known-keywords for the silos when i execute the functions - they just show my normal global denote-known-keywords. They only seem to work when I manually dired into the silo directory first and then execute the functions while physically in the silo.
  
​
 ;;; Directory Local Variables. For more information evaluate: ;;; ;;; (info "(emacs) Directory Variables") ((nil . ((denote-directory . "~/Documents/recipes/") (denote-known-keywords . ("french" "italian" "american" "mexican" "chinese" "japanese" "korean" "thai")) (denote-infer-keywords . nil)))) 
 Anyone encountering these problems?

However, I have only seen information on distributed hash maps and not maps that group related data to a node or group of close nodes. Does something like this exist?
 If not, would a key comprised of group id, table id, time, and data hash organize the data in the map so that table queries could still run quickly and not have to search all machines for the randomly distributed records.
 Also, I am intending this to be distributed across less than a hundred nodes, not thousands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of days back I made a post here asking how I can replicate my Emacs configuration for Front-end web dev in case I have to use a new computer. Some asked me to share my configuration.
 I installed the following packages from MELPA:
  
Company
 Emmet-mode
 lsp-mode
 web-mode
 yasnippet
  
I added these lines to my .emacs:
 ​
 (require 'web-mode) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.html?\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.css\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.phtml\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.tpl\\.php\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.[agj]sp\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.as[cp]x\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.erb\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.mustache\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.djhtml\\'" . web-mode)) (defun my-web-mode-hook () "Hooks for Web mode." (setq web-mode-markup-indent-offset 2) (setq web-mode-css-indent-offset 2) (setq web-mode-code-indent-offset 2) ) (add-hook 'web-mode-hook 'my-web-mode-hook) (require 'emmet-mode) (add-hook 'web-mode-hook 'emmet-mode) ;; Auto-start when the web-mode starts (add-hook 'emmet-mode-hook (lambda () (setq emmet-indent-after-insert nil))) (add-hook 'emmet-mode-hook (lambda () (setq emmet-indentation 2))) ;; indent 2 spaces. (require 'lsp-mode) (add-hook 'web-mode-hook #'lsp-deferred) 
 I installed VSCodes's language servers by running this command on the terminal:
 npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted 
 I added the directory (where the language server was installed) to my PATH variable.
 That's all. This config provides me with HTML/CSS autocomplete, autoclosing HTML tags and syntax checking CSS syntax.
 Any tips/opinions would be appreciated. I have not yet been able to get syntax checking of HTML, like what VSCode does (highlighting misspelled tags in red)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 In python it is possible to create a class that inherits a slew of methods and properties, how can I make these visible in emacs?
 People often mention speedbar,occur or imenu, but these only deal with the structure present in the current buffer. I need a way to see the entire resulting object and all of its methods and properties.
 I have been looking for a solution to this for a minute now and all I have right now is to open a python shell, import the class and do ´´dir(MyClass)´ and parse this.
 ECB is broken for emacs29, pyreverse breaks on our codebase and many people here mention just using a jump-to-definition type of function, which I consider to be only better than poking in the dark by having a cigarette lighter on you.
 Is it possible at all in emacs? 
 ​
 thx,
 S

 But unlike in the video (timestamp1 timestamp2), my pdf-buffer does not highlight passages in the pdf that have annotations. Things I have tried to no avail:
  
looking into the the maintainer's emacs configuration, but nothing springs to my eye there.
 playing around with org-noter-highlight-selected-text as mentioned in this solved issue
 installing packages such as org-pdftools
  
Does anybody have an init.el with an org-noter setup that highlights pdfs, which they would be willing to share with me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This version brings some minor enhancements to Iron's internals and API as well as support for another library: Borer.
 Main changes
 First order types support
 Iron now provides refinement methods for first order types:
 List(1, 2, 3).refineAllOption[Positive] //Some(List(1, 2, 3)): List[Int :| Positive] List(-1, 2, 3).refineAllOption[Positive] //None 
 Such methods exist for:
  
Imperative (refine/refineUnsafe)
 Option
 Either
 "Further" equivalents
  
Borer support
 Iron now supports Borer's codec derivation:
 type Username = String :| DescribedAs[Not[Blank], "Username must not be blank"] type Age = Int :| DescribedAs[Positive, "Age must be positive"] case class User(name: String :| Not[Blank], age: Int :| Positive) derives Codec Json.decode("""{"name":"hey","age":25}""".getBytes).to[User] //Right(...) Json.decode("""{"name":"","age":25}""".getBytes).to[User] //Left(ValidationFailure("Username must not be blank")) 
 Other changes
  
Gen/Arbitrary instances for types such as List[Int :| Positive] will not fail anymore, even for big sizes.
 refine is now deprecated in favor of refineUnsafe
 Upgraded doobie dependency to 1.0.0-RC5
 Minor changes to existing documentation
  
Adopters
 Marss was added to the list of adopters.

 The problem I have is with the following statement:
  syntax = "proto3"; 
 Even though, in the mode, syntax is declared as a keyword (c-other-decl-kwds) it is not highlighted. My guess is that it is not declared in the right category because syntax = "proto3"; is considered as an assignment in C/C++.
 Can anyone point me to the documentation to highlight syntax in this case but only if its followed by = "proto3";? Also, I'd like to highlight in the same color as import if possible, is there a way to change the color?

 I'm slightly bothered by this. How portable is this syntax when the same LaTeX file is opened by a different IDE, such as VSCode, TeXLive or (cloud-based) Overleaf? This is a concern when collaborating with others on editing a LaTeX file.
 Is it possible for the original LaTeX file to be untouched, while saving the "local variable" information in a different place for AUCTeX to access?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For quite some time I've had electric-pair-inhibit-predicate set to electric-pair-conservative-inhibit, which prevents the automatic insertion of closing delimiters in certain situations—even when electric-pair-mode is active.
 Recently I tried to get to the bottom of what this actually does, in case I wanted to further tweak its behavior. Unfortunately, I've found myself a little confused by some small things.
 The documentation for electric-pair-inhibit-predicate states
  
The function is called with a single char (the opening char just inserted). If it returns non-nil, then electric-pair-mode will not insert a matching closer.
  
The source code for electric-pair-conservative-inhibit is
 (defun electric-pair-conservative-inhibit (char) (or ;; I find it more often preferable not to pair when the ;; same char is next. (eq char (char-after)) ;; Don't pair up when we insert the second of "" or of ((. (and (eq char (char-before)) (eq char (char-before (1- (point))))) ;; I also find it often preferable not to pair next to a word. (eq (char-syntax (following-char)) ?w))) 
 I find this code a little confusing and am left with a few small questions.
  
Is there any difference between calling (char-after) and (following-char) in the context of this function?
 
Inside the and, why is it tested that char is equal to (char-before)? If char was just inserted, then I would imagine that this will just always be true.

 But still EGLOT never managed to be able to connect to it,
 until
 For Python, I just installed pylsp, changed my config to use it, and suddenly EGLOT was able to connect! prompting both servers, I chose pylsp and it works well, and even has the module functions when you import them in the popup. I shutdown the server and chose the pyright option and was disconnected after connecting (RIP).
 I did the same thing for clangd and installed a newer version of it, likewise, EGLOT managed to conenct.
 Moral of the story? Update your LSP's or just install a different one? :P
 I just need to get external libraries for C to be recognised by Company and then I'm good.

 One of my problems now in Emacs is to navigate up and down the M-x list which usually involves the up and down arrow keys. Those keys are available by using the function key in combination with the others, and also with the help of the mouse in GUI programs like this browser, but that is CHEATING.
 What are the native Emacs keys for that?
 Are there some cheatsheets that can help with these keyboards, for both regular emacs and evil-mode?
 I'm mostly an evil person, but having to switch to normal mode to navigate makes learning those Emacs key combinations worthwhile.

 In some rare cases, even when I click on the Treemacs window, it's not actually active. I wasn't able to reproduce this.
 I can't seem to be able to remember which window I'm actually on since I keep switching between them often I keep forgetting to check the statusbar to verify which window is actually active. Even when I'm trying to write code, sometimes I forget whether I'm in Insert or Normal mode and there seems to be some other mode sometimes that I can't get out of and when I type ESC, it takes that as part of a new macro. After trying it frustratingly, I manage to get back to the mode where I can actually start typing.
 Even having to check the statusbar every time before I need to do something does not seem correct to me. Is this what everybody does or am I missing something fundamental?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been attempting The One Billion Row Challenge in Haskell and my current solution is embarrassingly slow, taking roughly 6m15s. I'm still trying to eke out single-threaded performance for now, and I'm constraining myself to GHC boot packages (although I think `async` and `parallel` would probably be in the spirit of the challenge). With profiling it seems like currently most of my time is spent inserting into a Set in order to keep the weather station names sorted, but I don't know how to do better. Does anyone have advice and/or suggestions for how to optimise my solution?
 Edit: I optimised set insertion and now it's no longer the bottleneck, the new runtime is 3m20s:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've started experimenting with the javascript framework Astro. 
 Astro templates have their own file extension: .astro.
 Unsurprisingly, by default emacs doesn't know anything .astro files. 
 I can load web-mode for .astro files.
 .asto files seem to combine css and js.
 This would seem to make it suitable to use with web-mode.
 This seems to give me syntax highlighting and indentation. 
 It'd be great to get completions. 
 Over the last few months I've been using lsp-mode for completions.
 But because my lisp knowledge is limited, I'm reliant on finding snippets online for configuring lsp-mode.
 Do any emacs'ers here use astro?
 If so, what does your configuration look like?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm struggling with setting up an org-roam capture template that adds notes to a single, pre-defined file as org-mode headers instead of saving each note as a separate file.
 ​
 The following tests write the note into a file of my choosing, but the properties drawer with the ID is placed at the top of the file, not under the created header.
 Test 1:
 (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates '("a" "test" entry "* ${title}" :if-new (file "/mypath/myfile.org"))) 
 ​
 Test 2:
 (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates '("a" "test" entry "* ${title}" :if-new (file+head "/mypath/myfile.org" "#+title: ${title}\n"))) 
 ​
 Test 3:
 (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates '("a" "test" plain "* ${title}" :if-new (file+head "/mypath/myfile.org" "#+title: ${title}\n"))) 
 ​
 This test is adapted from https://systemcrafters.net/build-a-second-brain-in-emacs/keep-a-journal/ and will create a header with the properties drawer + ID - but that will always stay the top header of the file. Subsequent captures are placed within the same file but without property drawer and ID:
 (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates '("a" "test" plain "* ${title}" :if-new (file+head+olp "/mypath/myfile.org" "#+title: ${title}\n" ("${title}")))) 
 ​
 I'm currently making things work using regular org-mode capture templates. But I'd rather use org-roam capture templates so I can create new notes on the fly when searching for notes and finding they don't exist yet.
 ​
 Any ideas what else I can try to get this to work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, I've finally gotten around to setting up emacs-lsp-booster, and my first impression is: it works. And it works really well. I already liked LSP-Mode in general, but it was too slow for my very large Unreal project. I'd get constant timeouts, suggestions and completions just outright wouldn't work, and it was a very disappointing experience.
 I switched to LSP-Bridge because it promised better performance, and that was 100% true. It did completions where LSP-Mode and Eglot would choke, but it was a bit of a hassle to set up. I'm on a Windows machine and that always makes things a little more complicated for me. I had to make sure to write a project-root-finding-function or it wouldn't understand my project setup (devs: not everyone uses git, stop assuming that we do), etc.
 Ultimately, I'm switching back to LSP-Mode because it integrates with xref and helm and various other things a lot better. The LSP-Bridge built-in completion is adequate, but it worked in ways that I wasn't expecting/didn't like (the lsp-bridge-find-references function, for example, would split the buffer, and when I quit it, sometimes it would kill the buffer I'd been visiting as well. User error? A bug? Don't know.) You just end up having more flexibility with lsp-mode.
 What I can tell you is that no matter how you slice it, for a project of moderate to large size, you should be using something like lsp-bridge or emacs-lsp-booster. (For reference, based on my compile-commands.json file, there are about 17000 files in my project.)
 Also, it seems that the root of this problem is emacs' ability (or lack thereof) to parse JSON efficiently. That really should be looked at; emacs-lsp-booster is a project that shouldn't have to exist, but I'm grateful that it does.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have used Emacs as my daily-driver text editor for years now, but always on Linux systems. Setting it up now on my work laptop (a Mac) and having difficulty getting it to launch the way I want. If I try to run it from the terminal with the plain old emacs command, I run into the problem described here. The stty -tostop suggestion didn't work. However, elsewhere I found the suggestion to directly invoke the application from its installation directory, e.g. /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs.
 This solves the 'suspended output' issue and does indeed launch a GUI Emacs session. However, if I attempt to do this with the --init-directory flag, it fails to load the specified init.el and Emacs greets me with an 'unknown option' error. On the other hand, if I run Emacs in the foreground in the terminal, the --init-directory flag works and it sets up (as much as possible) according to the specified init.el file. I'm running version 29.2
 Does anyone know how to get this to work?

I haven't used Scala before this so please bear with my non-idiomatic/bad code lmao. I was mostly just trying to do what the book did without much deviation.

For this reason, I have been working on minipat, which is largely Tidal-compatible but hopefully makes it easy to add new backends! Currently, there are two - SuperDirt and MIDI. If anyone is interested, I would love some help adding backends for DAWs like Bitwig or Renoise, turning the system into a tool for rapid composition. Anyway, check it out if you are interested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm trying to configure polymode for Databricks notebooks. They are text files that have their content like this for some NotebookExample.sql :
 -- Databricks notebook source -- MAGIC %python -- MAGIC print("Hello") -- MAGIC print("World") -- COMMAND SELECT 1 FROM table 
 I've tried to replicate the configuration from their documentation and got to this:
 (use-package polymode :straight t :config (define-hostmode poly-databricks-hostmode :mode 'sql-mode) (define-innermode poly-python-databricks-innermode :mode 'python-mode :head-matcher "-- MAGIC " :tail-matcher "-- COMMAND " :head-mode 'host :tail-mode 'host) (define-polymode poly-databricks-mode :hostmode 'poly-databricks-hostmode :innermodes '(poly-python-databricks-innermode) ) ) 
 But this is not working as expected because from my investigations it expects to have some closed block. Like on this (another great one from u/mickeyp) post https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/polymode-multiple-major-modes-how-to-use-sql-python-in-one-buffer where the SQL code is contained with a well delimited piece of code between the:
 r""" CODE """ 
 Anyone knows if there's a way to make it ignore the "--MAGIC" markers between the beginning and the end? I also tried the indent option but it seems to just work with whitespace.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a feature in mind that I can't find, but am also struggling to articulate, so I'm still not sure if it exists or not!
 I'm thinking of something like literate programming, but without tangling, as the source code lives in files separately from the text. Instead of source blocks containing code in the literate document, the literate document instead specifies "views" into the source files. The views would be specified by a file name and a line number range, and that range of lines would be visible in the literate buffer as if that was where the text lived, but it actually lives in its own source file.
 So on-disk this "view src block" might look like this:
 ```
 +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124
 +end_view
 ```
 Whereas in the emacs buffer it might look like this:
 ```
 +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124
 let rectangle = Rectangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; let triangle = Triangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; print_debug(&rectangle); println!("Area: {}", area(&rectangle));
 +end_view
 ```
 Editing text within this view would be propagated back to the source file, and adding a newline at the end of the view would increment the end of the line range.
 The motivations for this would be avoiding problems with eglot/lsp in an org document for example, or a document explaining some bits of code in detail, without committing to the full literate workflow.
 Does this have a name and does anyone know of any implementations of something similar to this? If not, does anyone have any insight into how hard this would be to achieve in emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am writing a toy program.. it takes a string say "tom" and splits it into individual characters and gives out the following data 
 t = thriving o = ornate m = mad here the adjectives thriving, ornate and mad are stored in a data structure as key value pairs eg: ('a' , "awesome") 
 The issue i have is when a string has the same characters, the same adjective gets repeated and i don't want repetitions. 
 eg:- if i give the name sebastian, the adjectives "serene" and "awesome" is repeated twice.. which i don't want..
 It should select another adjective for the letters s and a ? How do i do that? Should i add more data structures? How do i move from one to another so as to avoid repetitions? 
 I am reproducing the code done till now below 
 ​
 -- Main.hs module Main where import qualified Data.Map as Map -- Define a map containing key-value pairs of alphabets and their values alphabetMap :: Map.Map Char String alphabetMap = Map.fromList [ ('a', "awesome"), ('b', "beautiful"), ('c', "creative"), ('d', "delightful"), ('e', "energetic"), ('f', "friendly"), ('g', "graceful"), ('h', "happy"), ('i', "innovative"), ('j', "joyful"), ('k', "kind"), ('l', "lovely"), ('m', "mad"), ('n', "nice"), ('o', "ornate"), ('p', "peaceful"), ('q', "quiet"), ('r', "radiant"), ('s', "serene"), ('t', "thriving"), ('u', "unique"), ('v', "vibrant"), ('w', "wonderful"), ('x', "xenial"), ('y', "youthful"), ('z', "zealous") ] -- Function to look up a character in the map and return its value lookupChar :: Char -> String lookupChar char = case Map.lookup char alphabetMap of Just val -> val Nothing -> "Unknown" -- Function to split a string into characters and look up their values lookupString :: String -> [String] lookupString str = map lookupChar str main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "Enter a string:" input <- getLine let result = lookupString input putStrLn "Result:" mapM_ putStrLn result

 I've been using emacs for some time now so, in that regard I'm not so new. I learned a couple of things about elisp in that time. However the creation of a major mode and a package development is completely new to me. I would appreciate first of all some general feedback and constructive criticism on my code and good practices.
 Also I'd like to ask if somebody here (or maybe there's a forum for that) would be open to give me advice from time to time. My references are usually the emacs lisp manual and internet search (i.e., emacs.stackexchange.com) but sometimes is difficult to find the exact info that you need, or the good practices or conventions. I'd appreciate if I could ask from time to time and get an experienced opinion and/or at least a good reference to solve particular problems.
 Any ideas, pointers or comments are welcome.

Also the end product is plain text and I can store it on every knowledge repository they use. I think it upgraded me as a professional. Being organized to the max goes a long way. 
 I’m totally hooked! Orgmode is addictive! 
 2 questions: - I use doom emacs, some orgmode packages and Org Agenda. Are there any more cool packages I should know about? - ODT exports are ugly. Weird line splits. I know about using templates but is there a simple way to make them more usable out of the box?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been a happy user of project.el for a while. I also like monorepos, and I'm glad to say that the support for them is good in project.el. One thing that I haven't figured out, is how to use project.el on projects outside of version control. I'd like to ask how I could fill that gap.
 For monorepo support, I have the following config, which probably looks straightforward to most of you.
 (defun common-lisp-project-p (dir) (directory-files dir nil ".*.asd$")) (defvar monorepo-root-markers '("package.json" "mix.exs" common-lisp-project-p)) (defun monorepo-try-find-project (dir) (when (file-exists-p dir) (let* ((root (seq-some (lambda (root-marker) (locate-dominating-file dir root-marker)) monorepo-root-markers)) (vc-backend (ignore-errors (vc-responsible-backend root)))) ;; I require a vc-backend, otherwise things break (when (and root vc-backend) (list 'vc vc-backend root))))) (setq project-find-functions '(monorepo-try-find-project project-try-vc)) 
 The problem is simply that this only works for projects under version control.
 How do people deal with this while using project.el?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been trying really hard to set up Emacs for front-end web development. After a lot of trial and error I finally got the major stuff working (snippets, autocomplete, syntax checking). To do this I had to install several packages and also add some elisp to my .emacs as mentioned on the websites of those packages.
 If i need to replicate this configuration later, maybe on another machine, how can I do it easily without having to go Googling again? Like is there some code to ensure that if a particular package is not found it will be installed automatically by Emacs, so the elisp in the .emacs that deals with this package wont throw an error? I do keep a record of my .emacs in my GitHub
 I don't know how to put this in a better way, but I just want to be able to replicate this configuration with another emacs installation without the same amount of effort.

 I am a computer science student and one of my future lesson is on contribution to open source software. I've been using Emacs for 3 years now, and I always wanted to deep into Elisp. Moreover, I discovered the functional language Coq last year, and I've become fond of it.
 Linking those two, I'd like to contribute to Proof General, the interface for proof assistants and especially for Coq inside Emacs. Do you have any advice on how to start ? i.e how to get enough knowledge on the software, getting in touch with contributors, general manners...
 Thanks in advance !

 So i can run `consult-ripgrep` and export the results using `embark-export` 
 ​
 I can modify in the exported buffer and they get reflected. 
 ​
 But i am not able to find a way to filter further or delete the result from the exported buffer.
 ​
 How do i filter the exported results further ?

 The warning shown below occurs any time my cursor goes over any headings such as "Important" or "Habits" and gets stuck. I have to use my mouse or error keys to get off the heading line.
 I'm not sure how I would go about debugging this as I'm not getting any warnings or errors that gives me any real information. Does anyone have any tips to try to get more information?
 Here is my org-super-agenda part of the config
 (setq org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t org-agenda-include-deadlines nil org-agenda-block-separator nil org-agenda-compact-blocks t org-agenda-start-day nil ;; i.e. today org-agenda-span 1 org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil org-super-agenda-groups '(;; Each group has an implicit boolean OR operator between its selectors.

 Is there a way to get a Haskell toolchain that just works? I've got sour experience with Haskell from the Linux repos (Arch). It's huge, unwieldy and is apt to turn into a brick on update (if it used to work before the update).
 https://hub.docker.com/r/fpco/stack-build/
 This one is much better. Ideal, I'd say, if it weren't for Docker :) . Several years ago I've seen a project on GitHub dedicated exactly to this purpose: A Haskell Toolchain that Just Works. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name of the project, and can't find it.
 The OS is Linux. Any suggestion is welcome.

More QualifiedDo examples by Oleg Grenrus
Qualified do-notation, QualifiedDo, is a nice syntactical extension in GHC. Probably its best property is that it changes semantics only locally, by using explicit “annotation”: by qualifying the do keyword. This means that enabling the extension doesn’t change meaning of other & existing code.

 I just don't understand why. The native binaries are gonna be faster so what was achieved from doing a reimplementation of these utilities in Lisp? I asked ChatGPT about this and it says this enables deep integration between the shell and emacs. But, what does that even mean? Whether I type ls or grep as a shell command or the lisp version of it, the output is the same anyway. So what kind of integration are we talking about?
 I'm coming from the vim world and just been using Emacs since a few days. So I'm trying to understand it. I'm really curious what people actually do in Eshell that the other shells can't do.
 EDIT: Got some great, insightful answers. I'm glad I asked this. Clearly there's a lot for me to learn. This is gonna be a fun journey. Thank you everyone!

 A question that I could not find an answer to so far is how one can expand/raise minibuffer window in emacs in a similar fashion to vim when you press `C-f` during a command. This will raise the command line prompt, allowing you to edit it with usual vim keys. An equivalent in emacs would remove the need to have copied (yanked) a long text for the prompt and paste it in the minibuffer.

 Does sbt still only runs on scala 2? It feels very strange to use two different versions of the same language for the build system and the main project.
 I also see scala-cli, but I don't know if it's powerful enough to handle platform-specific dependencies like lwjgl.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, everyone. I wanted to post a quick tip to help other noobs like myself. I love org-capture, but I sometimes want to make a completely new file out of quick note, rather than append it to an existing org-mode file. I searched and only found outdated or kind of hard-to-understand answers. So here is a quick snippet to put into your init.el and capture templates to enable creating a new file. 
 (defun jj/open-new-project-file () (let ((fpath (read-file-name "File name: " "~/Sync/inbox/" nil nil nil))) 
 As prescribed in the org docs, this creates a new function that will prompt you for a file name to create, starting in the directory you specify in the function. Then, in your org-capture templates add:
 ("i" "New note in Inbox" plain (function jj/open-new-project-file) "#+title: %?") 
 This will use your function to create the file and set your cursor ready to type the title in your new org file.
 ​
 I hope this helps someone. I know most people would probably just append to an inbox.org file or similar. I was doing the same thing, but after reading Building a Second Brain, I'm trying to separate the notes into files that can be dragged-and-dropped via Treemacs into the PARA setup I've made. It's a little simpler than trying to use org-refile because in the PARA method, your directories are constantly changing and moving.
 ​
 This solution was heavily inspired by this post: https://www.jesseevers.com/org-capture-function/
 I just modified it to fit my own use case and thought someone searching on Google in the future might appreciate it. Cheers!

 I am using doom emacs and enable the latex language module and setup everything else, anyways, I am not sure how to use Latex in emacs, so I was wondering if you know of good instructions on how to do this correctly, and for my case I am not sure if I should go with org mode as well, because I have never used it, thanks for the help.

Nix’s reproducible builds and its extensive package registry. That ruleset has proven to be

However, rules_nixpkgs is incompatible with remote execution. This is a major limitation given that remote
execution is possibly the main reason why people switch to Bazel. And that rules_nixpkgs provides a great way to configure hermetic toolchains, which are an important ingredient for reliable remote execution. There is no trivial fix as

 Default keymap for C-x commands.
 Is there a way to do an isearch or regex search of these descriptions from within the mini buffer? So that I can filter the list of candidates based on text in those descriptions, instead of the names of the commands/variables/functions/etc?
 I know you could embark export the list of candidates and then search them that way and that works with small lists but embark export does a lot of things in the buffer that I don't always need. If I just want to find something, don't know what it's called but do have an idea of what it does, this could be a very helpful way of refining the list of candidates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use both RefTeX and company-reftex for latex documents. For choosing the bibliographic reference, I much prefer company-reftex. But I like how C-c ] (reftex-citation) allows choosing from a list of citation formats (ditto for reftex-reference). The problem is that reftex-citation takes you to RefTeX's mechanism for choosing the bibliographic reference, which is not company-reftex.
 So I am now doing this:
  ;; From my reftex-cite-format; for real, this is a longer list (defvar my-cite-options '("\\cite[][]{}" "\\citep[][]{}" "\\citealp[][]{}" "\\citep[][p.~]{}")) (defun my-cite-menu () "Insert citation based on user choice." (interactive) (insert (completing-read "Choose citation type: " my-cite-options)) (backward-char) (company-complete)) ;; Preserve muscle memory (bind-key (kbd "C-c [") 'my-cite-menu reftex-mode-map) 
 (Same comments apply to reftex-reference, where I reuse my reftex-ref-style-alist, and create a my-reference-menu).
 This seems to me like the obvious solution because: a) it preserves muscle memory; b) I can reuse my lists of citation options and reference styles, and if I wanted to go back to a pure-reftex solution it would be simple; c) I can continue easily choosing structure; d) I use company-reftex; e) it seems simple enough.
 But I have not found anything similar when searching for it. I wonder if I am doing something silly, or reinventing a wheel (and ending up with a square wheel as a result, given my elisp ignorance).

 My system is a MacBook Pro M1 MAX, so there should be no problem with hardware performance.
 I am using emacs-plus@29 and have enabled nativecomp. Here are the parts related to lsp code completion and performance in my configuration, I did everything I can find to boost the performance but still not as fast as Neovim's lsp (via gopls and rust-analyzer).
 Is there anything to improve?

In this time, a common theme was a separation between the encoder and the decoder part. While with some trickery, you can get a specification such as code = Constructor <$> extractA <*> extractB to work for newtypes, I have never found a nice approach for ADTs that let me plug-and-play codes for field (without changing the type definitions, anyway. I know you can do some magic with an additional functor argument that you put in front of every field. Your mileage may vary).
 In any case, I found the state unsatisfactory and set out to find a solution and - to my own surprise - was successful. If you just want code here is a proof of concept on github. It even has a few comments and a nice README.

And now I'm testing flyckeck Grammarly, it is better but the explanation of the issue with text is not helpful. My English is not perfect and I have problems understanding what to do to fix the grammar mistakes. Example:
  
The noun phrase first element seems to be missing a determiner before it. Consider adding an article.
  
I don't understand what this hint suggests. The browser extension has a suggestion that you can click to fix the grammar mistakes. Does any Emacs mode have something similar? I thought that lsp mode use company mode to allow fixing grammar mistakes from dropdown menu, but I was told that the company mode only works with completion and doesn't work with lsp-grammarly.
 I can fix mistakes by hand, but I need to have a list of fixes to apply. lsp-grammarly had even more cryptic hints "Correct article usage". Those are only in browser extension but there is a proper grammar listed that I can apply.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using org-roam for a while. But I have found its template system confusing.
 I think there are two use cases:
  
Creating a new node (for this the templates work well)
 
Adding data to an already existing node.
 
 The templates are also used when the user runs org-roam-node-find and the selected node-title does not exist. This is probably whey templates in org-roam behave very different than org templates.
 Last weekend I finally spent time and address some of these issues. The commits are here:
 https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/compare/main...dmgerman:org-roam:main
 for example.The first template will only work when creating a new file (see :create-file). It will ask for the node-title and use it to create the file (the slug).
  (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates `("A" "area" plain "%?" :target (file+head ,(eval (dmg-roam-build-path "areas/${slug}.org")) ,(eval (dmg-roam-template "plain.txt"))) :create-file yes :unnarrowed t)) 
 If the path is provided, the user will not be asked for the destination. if the template has :create-file no, and the file does not exist, the capture will be aborted.
 In contrast, this template will ask for a node id, and then search for the "Tasks" header. node and node+olp will not create a new file.
  (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates `("t" "todo" entry "*** TODO %?\n%t\n%a\n\n%i" :target (node+olp nil ("Tasks")) :unnarrowed t)) 
 If the node id is provided, the user will NOT be asked for the node id.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By comparing the parser combinator implementation in the paper Parsec: Direct Style Monadic Parser Combinators For The Real World and the one actually used in the parsec library, I found they are quite different.
 The implementation in the paper defines the Parser type as follows
 type Parser a = String → Consumed a data Consumed a = Consumed (Reply a) | Empty (Reply a) data Reply a = Ok a String | Error 
 The implementation in the parsec library uses
 newtype ParsecT s u m a = ParsecT {unParser :: forall b . State s u -> (a -> State s u -> ParseError -> m b) -- consumed ok -> (ParseError -> m b) -- consumed err -> (a -> State s u -> ParseError -> m b) -- empty ok -> (ParseError -> m b) -- empty err -> m b } 
 The latter uses a continuation-based approach instead of different constructors. I can see why it works. But until yesterday I did not know that this method had a formal name - "church encoding".
 My question is
  
Why does church encoding improve the performance of parser combinators? Surely it avoids the "wrapping"/"unwrapping" data into/out of constructors. So the abstraction and application of lambdas must be cheaper, right?
 And how much? I haven't found a paper describing refactoring of parser combinator libraries using church encoding and the benchmark comparison.

It is good practice to keep the titles of a Zettel short:
On the one hand, the task of writing a short title helps the learning process.
On the other hand, the visualization of the notes is better if the title is short.
However, my question is, do you know if there is a sweet spot for the length of a title?
In my case, I try to write titles of 80 characters or less (with the UUID included). I selected this quantity due to my background in programming, where it is recommended to limit code lines to 80 characters. In my experience, this length is a good challenge that helps both objectives (1) and (2).
But I am considering increasing it a bit: maybe 100 characters.
What maximum length for titles do you use?]]></summary>

 I'm trying to get GPT4ALL working with the gptel package, after getting past some errors, now another error got thrown while trying to use gptel: could not parse http response?
 The gpt4all-chat gui works fine, but in emacs with gptel, it throws this error.
 I found a similar issue in the gptel repo, so I posted my issue there, if any of you would like to take a look, thanks.

I tried using old Hazlecast lib but it is giving errors as it was compatible with 3.12 version of Hazlecast not latest version. If I go with Java implementation I have to write my own serializaton implementations(I have 50+ maps to serialize). Is there any other way I can serialize so that I can store maps easily. I am using scala dotty.

I installed them as per normal in ~/.local/share/fonts and they show up in the fonts section of the GUI appearance manager (and are completely usable in KDE). However, they can't be found by wezterm or Emacs.
 Anyone had this problem before? I've never had an issue with openSUSE or Arch. 
 I've also installed them in /usr/share/fonts and of course ran sudo fc-cache -v.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose I have the following in my emacs config.
  (use-package general :config (general-create-definer leader-key :prefix leader-key-pfx) (general-create-definer local-leader-key :prefix local-leader-key-pfx)) 
 I could then use the above to create a binding in a specific key map (e.g., for emacs-lisp-mode) as follows.
  (local-leader-key :keymaps 'emacs-lisp-mode-map "e s" 'eval-surrounding-sexp) 
 I would like to group such bindings, for instance, based on the mode they affect.
 If I understand correctly, use-package could be used for arbitrary configurations and does not need to be tied to a specific package.
 So, I tried the following.
  (use-package emacs-lisp-mode :config (local-leader-key :keymaps 'emacs-lisp-mode-map "e s" 'eval-surrounding-sexp)) 
 Now, the settings do not take into effect when I open an elisp file or a buffer in emacs-lisp-mode.
 Could someone help me fix the config?

 Does emacs use a different font rendering engine than the rest of the system?
 I tried setting ns-use-thin-smoothing but found no difference in rendering.
 Thanks!

I've been looking at the lsp-mode documentation, but I can't figure out how to disable code actions on save (and honestly, I'd rather keep that and just turn off whatever it's trying to do to the imports, but I haven't found a setting for that). I've also been looking at the configuration options on the ts-ls repo, but I'm unsure of how to set those through emacs-lsp, and couldn't find any documentation on setting server-specific settings.

 The following table shows results from a questionnaire:
 #+name: sus-questionnaire-results #+caption: SUS Questionnaire Results #+attr_latex: :align l|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|l :font \fontspec{Noto Sans Condensed Light} | USER | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Q6 | Q7 | Q8 | Q9 | Q10 | SUS | |------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+------| | U1 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 60.0 | | U2 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 87.5 | | U3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 80.0 | #+tblfm: $12='(ux:sus-calc-score-per-row '($2..$11));N 
 The SUS column is calculated for each row using the values from column 2 to 11. When the ‘N’ flag is used, all referenced elements are parsed as numbers and interpolated as Lisp numbers
 Here is the elisp function:
 (defun ux:sus-calc-score (lst) (let ((counter 0)) (mapcar (lambda (x) (setq counter (1+ counter)) (if (= 0 (% counter 2)) (- 5 x) (1- x))) lst))) (defun ux:sus-calc-score-per-row (lst) (* (apply '+ (ux:sus-calc-score lst)) 2.5)) 
 Thats all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted to show you how to use org tables with custom elisp functions, in case you dont know its possible:
 The following table shows results from a questionnaire:
 #+name: sus-questionnaire-results #+caption: SUS Questionnaire Results #+attr_latex: :align l|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|l :font \fontspec{Noto Sans Condensed Light} | USER | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Q6 | Q7 | Q8 | Q9 | Q10 | SUS | |------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+------| | U1 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 60.0 | | U2 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 87.5 | | U3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 80.0 | #+tblfm: $12='(ux:sus-calc-score-per-row '($2..$11));N 
 The SUS column is calculated for each row using the values from column 2 to 11. When the ‘N’ flag is used, all referenced elements are parsed as numbers and interpolated as Lisp numbers
 Here is the elisp function:
 (defun ux:sus-calc-score (lst) (let ((counter 0)) (mapcar (lambda (x) (setq counter (1+ counter)) (if (= 0 (% counter 2)) (- 5 x) (1- x))) lst))) (defun ux:sus-calc-score-per-row (lst) (* (apply '+ (ux:sus-calc-score lst)) 2.5)) 
 Thats all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using org-mode to takes notes and inserting images, which are stored in local in a relative directory. I am really puzzled because some images are not displayed and instead i see a simple link to the image. 
 The format i am usiing is
 [[file:images/img.jpg][DESCRIPTION]]
 Images are correctly placed in folder because clicking the link open the image.
 Things i have tried:
 - org-display-inline-images from the config and toggling it in the same buffer, no luck 
 - org-toggle-inline-images, no luck 
 - remove all configurations from my emacs
 - install latest org-mode using package-manager replacing the native one
 I am sure is something silly I am not figuring out. Help?
 emacs: 29.2
 org-mode: 9.6.19
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back i made a post on a different Problem where i mentioned this as well, but i'm not able to track this down. So i'm, once again, asking for help here.
 Basically, at a random point in time after starting emacs, it will create buffers named "*emacs*" in the background.
 https://preview.redd.it/sy147bu3mxkc1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=72f99a091f59e8332e2a1a067b2b2ad8eeff33ae
 They seem to be somehow related to me moving through files. I have only my init.el file open and moving up and down makes new buffers appear in that list. This isn't consistent though. If i restart emacs, i can move through my init file just fine. And at some point, this just starts happening.
 Some of those buffers are empty, and some have just "Lisp Expression:" with nothing else written in them.
 I already tried stripping down my config and haven't been able to track it down. I ripped the whole completion setup out, threw out treemacs and such, ran without all the eglot and language modes and tried without org and evil configuration. Nothing seems to help.
 Is there a hook or option i can use to get more information on how or by what those buffers are created? Maybe write a verbose log on those events or such? Although i've worked with emacs for quite some time, i seem to be pretty bad at configuring and troubleshooting it, so some hints would help me a lot here.
 If someone wants to look at my config, the current state is here: Dominik Schlack / Domacs · GitLab

 I've always had this problem and I want to see if someone can please help me: I have the following code in my config:
  ;; Set backup directory for files (setq backup-directory-alist `(("." . ,(expand-file-name "backups/" user-emacs-directory)))) ;; Set auto-saves directory for buffers (make-directory (expand-file-name "auto-saves/" user-emacs-directory) t) (setq auto-save-list-file-prefix (expand-file-name "auto-saves/sessions" user-emacs-directory) auto-save-file-name-transforms `((".*" ,(expand-file-name "auto-saves/" user-emacs-directory) t))) ;; Disable lock files - enable if they cause trouble while compiling ;; (setq create-lockfiles nil) ;; Set directory for temp projectile and lsp files (setq projectile-known-projects-file (expand-file-name "tmp/projectile-bookmarks.eld" user-emacs-directory) lsp-session-file (expand-file-name "tmp/.lsp-session.v1" user-emacs-directory)) ;; Make backups to backup directory (setq backup-by-copying t delete-old-versions t kept-new-versions 6 kept-old-versions 2 version-control t) 
 It creates ## files as backups in the directory, which is really nice. But, if I have a [/] in an org header (a progress thing for a checklist), it continually asks upon hitting `C-x s` if I want to save the file. If I quit out of Emacs with `C-x C-c`, then it will not only ask, but also say that some buffers are modified, and do I want to really quit? I find this behavior to be a little weird. I'm just looking to see if anyone can help me make it so that backups are saved/taken care of silently in the background, and when hitting `C-x s`, it doesn't prompt me to save the backup file each time. Instead, it prompts for normal (non-backup) buffers.
 I don't know *why* it continually updates the backup files if I have a [/] in the header, but it does. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know?
 Thanks! 🙃

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I'm having trouble getting this to work, linked below is the github issue, if any of you would like to take a look, thanks.
 https://github.com/karthink/gptel
 Recently I installed the gpt4all-chat package from the nix packages unstable channel:
 gpt4all-chat
 And it works really well, but I wanted to get gpt4all working in emacs since I do everything in there. Anyways, your gptel package is just what I need in order to have gpt4all working smoothly in emacs. But I've run into some an error when trying to setup gpt4all working in emacs with your gptel package.
 Warning (gptel): Preferred `gptel-model' "gpt4all-falcon-newbpe-q4_0.gguf" notsupported in "GPT4All", using "nil" instead Disable showing Disable logging
 I copied the model files from the settings section of the gpt4all-chat gui app, then pasted them in the gptel configuration in config.el(I'm using nix-doom-emacs). But this error is getting thrown? nix-doom-emacs repo broke a while back so it's stuck at doom emacs version 28.2, but that shouldn't be an issue for this gptel package, at least I don't think so?
 Thanks in advance for the help.
 Here's my config.el configuration for gptel below:
 ;;---------------------------------------------------
 ;; gptel llm configuration:
 (use-package! gptel
 :config
 ;;(setq! gptel-api-key "your key")
 ;; OPTIONAL configuration

 gptel-backend (gptel-make-gpt4all "GPT4All" :protocol "http"))
 (setq-default gptel-max-tokens 500))
 ;; gptel llm backend configurations:

 I'm currently implementing that value restriction in my init.el with something like this:
 (setq org-global-properties '( ("MEETING_ALL" . "Staff Finance ProjectX ProjectY") ("FLAVOR_ALL" . "Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla") ;; ... and so on )) 
 However, I want to be able to have some property values that contain whitespace. So "Project X" and "Project Y" instead of ProjectX and ProjectY. I read the org-global-properties description but I still haven't got enough hang of car and cdr and cons to know for sure what it's on about. So I guessed and simply \-escaped some "", like this:
 (setq org-global-properties '( ("MEETING_ALL" . "Staff Finance \"Project X\" \"Project Y\"") ("FLAVOR_ALL" . "Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla") ;; ... and so on )) 
 To my surprise, that works fine, but is it The Right Way to do it? One small thing that concerns me is that it doesn't appear to be handled very well by emacs' lisp mode. So if I have it as a vertical list, I get this:
 (setq org-global-properties '( ("MEETING_ALL" . "Staff Finance \"Project X\" \"Project Y\"") ("FLAVOR_ALL" . "Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla") ;; ... and so on )) 
 None of this is the end of the world, I know, but I just wanted to check in case I'm really supposed to code it as some kind of nested parens monstrosity, but one that's at least indented according to some sensible aesthetic! Ye know -- the kind of thing you come to expect with Lisp :-)

 As far as I understood, f is a function that takes two arguments f (x , y).

Should f be a function whose one of its arguments is also a function or just a type variable?
 I am starting my studies with Haskell that's why I'm still dumb, please have some patience.
 I am asking this question in this subreddit because there no other one that can help me out.

 The behavior I'm looking for is exemplified by consult-gh: https://github.com/armindarvish/consult-gh. If you take a look at the demo GIFs in the README, you'll see that when repos are searched for, it shows a list where each repo has multiple "columns:" one for the repo author/name, one for it being public or private, one for a date, and one for a description. Looking at the source code, I see that the author of this package in particular used propertize to get different faces for each part, but it's not clear to me how to get the column alignment looking nice. Suggestions on the column alignment would be most appreciated!

The problem is because of my particular use case, the function that is being tested may not always be defined. When this happens, the test itself errors out because the function doesn't exist and I have to comment out that test. Is there a way to detect if a variable has been defined, and return a Maybe where if the variable doesn't exist it returns Nothing and if variable A does exist it returns Just A? I have other ways to go about this but this would be the most convenient way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty new to Emacs, so go easy on me if I'm missing something obvious, but I've read all of the documentation that I could find on running Emacs as a server and every time I think I've fixed the issue something strange happens again.
 I am on version 29. Currently, the way I start the daemon is with systemd. I enable and start the service as the documentation shows.
 The issue has to do with where the daemon creates the socket. Sometimes when I boot up my machine, everything works exactly as I expect it to: I can simply run `emacsclient -nc` and it pops right up. I can also set my shell environment variable EDITOR to emacsclient and open files easily that way. When things are working right, I note that the socket is in /run/user/userID/emacs/server.
 Probably half the time I boot up, the socket is in ~/.emacs.d/server/server, which means I have to pass the path to the socket to emacsclient for it to work. This means I have to change the scripts bound to my keybindings, etc., every time this happens. Pain in the butt. And for some reason I don't understand, setting EDITOR=emacsclient -cn -s /path/to/server doesn't work the way I want it to. It opens up a new frame, but does not open a buffer with the current file.
 So my questions more broadly are
  
How does Emacs determine where it creates the socket? You would think it just looks at server-socket-dir, but there's obviously more to it than that, because it changes it up on me regardless of whether I explicitly set that variable.
 And does anybody have any hunches as to what could be causing it to seemingly randomly flip back and forth between socket locations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would love to have the ephemeral buffers sorted in an extra category below the regular buffers when calling consult-buffer. The following definition doesn't work. It does sort them as wanted, but when I choose them, the buffer doesn't switch to *Messages* or *scratch*, it just stays as the current buffer. (The regular buffers can be chosen in the upper part of the consult-menu as usual.)
 What did I do wrong?
  (setq consult-buffer-sources '(consult--source-hidden-buffer consult--source-modified-buffer consult--source-buffer (:name "Ephemeral" :narrow 109 :category buffer :items ("*Messages*" "*scratch*" "*Async-native-compile-log*" "*Bookmark List*")))) (setq consult-buffer-filter '("\\` " "\\`\\*Completions\\*\\'" "\\`\\*scratch\\*\\'" "\\`\\*Messages\\*\\'" "\\`\\*Bookmark List\\*\\'" "\\`\\*EMMS-Log\\*\\'" "\\`\\*Flymake log\\*\\'" "\\`\\*Semantic SymRef\\*\\'" "\\`\\*tramp/.*\\*\\'")) 
 I need to filter them, so they are not listed twice, but just in the extra category. And neither :category buffer nor :category 'buffer works.
 I am grateful for any advice.
 Edit: I am using Emacs 30.0.50 and Consult 1.3.

 I usually don't use emacs but I am getting into org-mode again and I am having trouble installing packages from melpa.
 When I do a "M-x package-refresh-content" emacs tells me that it is contacting host elpa.gnu.org:443 then elpa.nongnu.org:443 , then melpa.org:443 and finally gives up with "failed to download melpa archive".
 I have this in my init.el:
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t) (package-initialize) 
 I can however type the configured melpa-url in my brower, where it works.
 I am on Debian with emacs 29.
 Does anybody have an idea what this problem might me or how to attack it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I need some help assessing the root of my performance problems when using Emacs, especially while using org mode.
 If while writing an Org document I end up with a rather long paragraph (~550 chars), editing becomes noticeably slow to the point of being pretty annoying and kinda frustrating.
 I ran the profiler of Doom Emacs (https://imgur.com/a/nMYWLOz) and my results show that jit-lock, which IIRC is like a variant of font-lock, and more especifically jit-lock-fontify-keywords-region, is my main culprit here, or at least the most notable one.
 After that, I disabled font-lock-mode in my buffer and the editing was snappy again, so I tried disabling some modes inside that same buffer but to no avail.
 My hunch here is that either I'm facing an Emacs limitation or maybe it's just my hardware being too slow. I'm leaning more towards the latter, but I'm pretty new to Emacs so I just don't know (and can't reliably test this in my other, more powerful laptop).
 So what do you think? What could I do to mitigate this while not sacrificing too much of the eye-candiness of Org?
 Thanks in advance!
 My PC specs:
  
CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 3250U (2 cores, 4 threads @ 2.6 GHz) w/integrated GPU.
 RAM: 12 GB DDR4 @ 2400 MT/s
 Screen: 1920x1080p LCD LED

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Experts
 ​
 Maybe i am doing this wrong.
 What I want to do is understand what a function in an emacs plugin is doing.
 E.g. I want to understand what consult--fd-make-builder does in consult.el file
 ​
 What i did was copy over the function locally and renamed (rd/consult--fd-make-builder) it and then added the advice
 ​
 lisp (advice-add 'consult--fd-make-builder :override #'rd/advice-consult--fd-make-builder) 
 ​
 intention is that this will now execute my local function and i can look at it with message
 ​
 Now when i run consult-fd i get
 ​
 lisp apply: Invalid function: (".") 
 ​
 i tried just copying the function without renaming.
 ​
 then i get
 ​
 lisp Error running timer: (void-variable cmd) \[2 times\] 
 ​
 ​
 Can someone help me as to how i can do this or what I am doing wrong?
 ​
 TIA
 EDIT: Figured out the issue, looks like lexical scope was defined.

 I'm sure it's user error, but what am I doing wrong? (And/or, where should I be searching for this, or what did I miss when searching here?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While doing some package maintenance, I've noticed that when visiting "circe-pkg.el" file, flycheck highlighted the define-package function as obsolete. So I went to the source and found the following, suggesting it has been obsoleted in Emacs 29.1 without a replacement to use:
 (defun define-package ( _name-string _version-string &optional _docstring _requirements &rest _extra-properties) "Define a new package. [...]" (declare (obsolete nil "29.1") (indent defun)) (error "Don't call me!")) 
 I've checked the git blame output and found nothing useful in the commit message motivating this either:
 ade7a212a882540178d9504e7e0bd3be3bf1fd41 Author: Stefan Kangas <stefankangas@gmail.com> AuthorDate: Mon Jul 11 12:41:50 2022 +0200 Commit: Stefan Kangas <stefankangas@gmail.com> CommitDate: Mon Jul 11 12:51:00 2022 +0200 Parent: c0ced4e4998 Prevent setting user time if the WM doesn't support it Merged: emacs-25 Contained: master Follows: emacs-28.1.90 (157359) Precedes: emacs-29.0.90 (6898) * lisp/emacs-lisp/package.el (define-package): Make obsolete. 
 No mention in the NEWS file either or on emacs-devel.
 The best explanation I have for this is the following:
  
You're not supposed to call the function, it merely acts as special syntax for package.el to interpret.
 Outright removal of the function is a bad idea due to people looking up its docstring.
 Before actually removing a function, it is obsoleted to detect people still using it and give them ample time to adjust.
  
I still find obsoletion shows the wrong signal here. One is still supposed to use it as seen in the elisp reference and marking the function as obsolete only creates more confusion. What was the motivation to do that?

 One question that has come to mind though is whether anyone uses `query-replace` over `query-replace-regex` and if so why? What are the benefits that `query-replace` has over its regex alter ego, or conversely am I instead missing some drawbacks to always defaulting to the `regex` version?
 ​
 For context, I've rebound `M-%` to use the `regex` version as it's already a bit of an awkward key bind, but am I struggling with Chesterton’s Fence in this case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a big fan of org-roam and would like to add all of my old notes in there of course! These notes are spread over a lot of directories on my system and in different formats (.txt, .md, .doc). Migration to org-roam will make navigating through all of my notes much more comfortable and I already migrated most of my notes.
 The last notes I want to migrate have a "directory context". For instance holiday notes in my pictures directory. I am considering to copy/paste these files to org-roam and add a tag to the directory and delete the old note. The downside is that this is kinda an org-roam lock in, because migrating these notes back could be a PITA. If I use a special tag in the roam-note to the original directory then it is possible to migrate the files back with a simple elisp script I guess but could break when directories are renamed in the future. Hopefully I am making myself clear .
 Just before sending this to Reddit a light bulb went off. I could copy/paste the original note in the org-roam note in a code block and tangle it to this directory. I would prefer to not use a code block but something like this seems to be the way.
 How are you guys dealing with old "directory context" notes?

 Is there a way to make project.el disregard .gitignore?
 I know i can "(project-find-file 'INCLUDE-ALL)", but is there a way to set 1 one time so i can M-x project-find-file and it will just work (without any addtional flags.)

 I then tried the following code snippet from the documentation (from the `scala-cli` repl):
 ```julia
 val xs = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 
 xs.map(_ + 1) // List(2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 
 xs.filter(_ < 3) // List(1, 2) 
 xs.find(_ > 3) // Some(4) 
 xs.takeWhile(_ < 3) // List(1, 2)

 The filter command failed with a "Bad symbolic reference" error. I then ran the command `sudo apt install default-jre`, which resulted in a few more packages being installed
 This time, the `filter` command succeeded, but the `takeWhile` command failed with the following error message:
  
Bad symbolic reference. A signature refers to JFunction1$mcZI$sp/T in package scala.runtime.java8 which is not available. It may be completely missing from the current classpath, or the version on the classpath might be incompatible with the version used when compiling the signature.
 1 error found
  
what else do I need to install?
 btw my Java version is:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 This comes up all the time when I try to write some haskell but I don't know if there's a better way to handle it, it happens most often when I am using new type
 Suppose I have a new type
  newtype Matrix = Matrix [[Int]] 
 and in function pattern matching I am destructuring it:  invertMatrix :: Matrix -> Maybe Matrix invertMatrix (Matrix xss) = ................... 
 but then in the function body I might have to use some other util functions that take the newtype Matrix instead of the internal representation. In this example I probably would need  determinant :: Matrix -> Float 
 This often means I am rewrapping xss in Matrix just to pass it to determinant, which is cumbersome and I don't know if that would cause performance issue?
 Is there a way in the function pattern matching to get xss and an additional variable to bind the whole Matrix xss so I can pass it around? I believe in rust for example they have a way to do that by using @ like
  match x { Constructor(inner) @ whole => .... }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a beginner in programing.
 Currently, I'm reading a Haskell (my first language) book and pretend to make a project with the intent of learning by doing things in practice; the project is: Design a game engine, I know there's a big potential of learning with such project, because it involves a lot of things (I also would like to make this engine "a real thing", if things go the right way)
 As I have read, people don't recommend using primarily Haskell for such, and I can't tell a lot of the reasons, because I'm a beginner; the reasons I'm aware of are:
 1 - Worse performance compared to languages like C/C++/Rust (which is relevant to games).
 2 - Haskell is not mainstream, so there's not much development being done with regards to games.
 I'm not sure if in someway it becomes "bad" to do "game engine things" with a functional language for some strange reason, I believe you guys might have the property to know about it.
 I pretend to learn Rust after getting a good understanding of Haskell (although I believe I might need to learn python first, considering the demand nowadays).
 Regarding the game engine project, I'd like to know if it would be a good idea to use Rust as the main language while Haskell for a lot of parts of it, or would it be a terrible thing to do? (losing a lot of performance or any other problem associated with this association of Rust + Haskell).
 Thanks to everyone.

 I have made a guide on how to play media (local and remote) using Emacs and MPV so it works with unified config across both Linux and Android.
 To install and configure the GUI Emacs app on Android and see my unified configuration file you can check out my dotfiles on danijelcamdzic/dotemacs and also read about it in one of my previous posts - Sharing my Emacs workflow and dotfiles
 Up until now, I wasn't able to get a working config which would allow me to play media through the MPV commands in my Android Emacs but I have figured it out and would like to share the steps for anyone who, like me, wishes to quickly check out their knowledge base, movie collection, song collection etc. in Emacs and quickly play them on your phone.
 The steps are described in my README - MPV section and this is how it looks like when I try to play a video on my Emacs Android:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need some help resolving a gap in my understanding of elisp. I have a hard time understanding what kinds of arguments a function expects. Here is an example with define-key, but happens to me with lots of functions. Basically, I can never tell if an argument needs to be quoted. Correct usage of define-key:
  (define-key gnus-article-map (kbd "i") #'gnus-article-show-images) 
 I frequently make the error where I think I am supposed to quote the keymap. I have to look up some old code to see, oh yeah, you don't quote the keymap.
 Then when I use use-package, I would write
 (use-package gnus :bind (:map gnus-article-map ("i" . gnus-article-show-images))) 
 Now the function gnus-article-show-images is unquoted, I guess, because this is a macro? The structure of the arg list to :bind is unclear from the function documentation, so I just have to look up another example where I used :bind to figure out the format. Anther example, in general-define-key both keymap and function are quoted. Why?
 What am I missing so that I can better understand whether args need to be quoted or not?

 As you may know, mu4e is an email client for emacs. It consists of a server program that scans your email messages and an emacs program talking to this server program, as well as a number of command-line utilities.
 I'm happy to announce mu 1.12, a new stable release which has been in development for ca. 1 year since the 1.10.
 Some highlights:
  
Significant speedups in both mu and mu4e 
 Reworked message composition, closer to its Gnus origins which adds many of its features
 Overhauled the query parser; squashing a number of bugs/limitations, incl. dealing with CJK messages 
 Experimental folding of message threads 
 Better and faster indexing of HTML messages 
 Experimental search by (human) language wit CLD2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, 
 I've been working professionally in Scala for the last year and a half and it was nothing but unrest.
 First, the Scala 3 migration started this painful event that fragments the already fragmented multi versions hassle that everyone needs to go through 2.12 / 2.13, and now 3. Have to mention, this is not only dependent on our codebase. For example, Databricks is still on 2.12, on the other hand, some new libraries are Scala 3 only, or Scala 2 support was deprecated.
 Then Akka became a non-open source, and we had to find a solution and picked the Typelevel ecosystem.
 There was another "shock" to the ZIO ecosystem when their leader left the project. Fortunately for us, we haven't invested in ZIO not a single hour, but this is another negative event in Scala ecosystem.
 After working for half a year with Typelevel, we wrote some services and a few internal libraries. It wasn't bad, maybe not as simple as Akka, but it worked as expected. However, it was a huge struggle for half of the team to understand this code and for some to even understand the concept.
 Then Pekko came out and we had another meeting, where 100% of the team voted against using Typelevel again.
 So, we are "officially" using Pekko for all our new services, which is basically the old Akka in maintenance mode. I don't see how this stack has any future.
 Now, it looks like a few experimental libraries evolve around virtual threads. My bet this is the future of Scala since they are simple yet powerful as Effect systems.
 But I hear more and more people are saying - until these are ready, there will be "no Scala", since the language in a rapid decline (sad, but true).
 Sharing this because I'm tired of the constant unrest in Scala, and curious what strategy your team has regarding this.
 Thanks

The Haskell Foundation, apparently, were able to secure the HaskellExchange videos from them, and are now working towards making them available online on youtube (https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-video-archive-call-for-volunteers/8863)
 Can the Scala Center reach out to the SkillsMatter management and do the same? It would be a terrible shame to lose those amazing talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(edit, using org-roam, obviously... should have mentioned that in the title...)
 I am trying to extend the functionality of the roam buffer so that it not only updates to show backlinks for the node at point, but also so if point wanders over a link, it will show backlinks for the linked node, rather than the node I currently have open. I tried advising org-roam-node-at-point like this (code generated with chatgpt's help, apologies if anything is wrong; my elisp-fu is weak):
 ​
 (defun my-org-roam-node-at-point (&optional assert) "Return the Org-roam node at point if it exists, or the node corresponding to the link at point." (interactive) (let ((id (plist-get (link-hint--get-link-at-point) :args))) (if (and id (string-prefix-p "id:" id)) (progn (print (substring id 3)) (org-roam-node-from-id (substring id 3))) (org-roam-node-at-point )))) (advice-add 'org-roam-node-at-point :override #'my-org-roam-node-at-point) 
 This doesn't work, but it does succeed at breaking the roam-buffer, so I suspect an approach sort of like this could work, but I'm in over my depth. Anyone have any ideas, insight, or a snippet that does this already?

 Thanks!

 ​
 A very basic question. I am very new to emacs so please bear with me.
 ​
 I understand how to pass arguments to an elisp function.
 ​
 but not able to comprehend how to use it in conjunction with a list
 for example
 (interactive (list (read-shell-command (if shell-command-prompt-show-cwd (format-message "Async shell command in `%s': " (abbreviate-file-name default-directory)) "Async shell command: ") nil nil (let ((filename (cond (buffer-file-name) ((eq major-mode 'dired-mode) (dired-get-filename nil t))))) (and filename (file-relative-name filename)))) current-prefix-arg shell-command-default-error-buffer ) ) 
 i can understand what this code does, but because i dont understand how/what arguments the list will take e.g. `read-shell-command`/`current-prefix-arg`/`shell-command-default-error-buffer`/`read-string`
 i am having a hard time creating one myself.
 ​
 Can someone please explain this to me in a simple way?
 Also what all can i pass?
 ​
 i can think of command line arguments in couple of forms:
  
shell command
 string
 integer
 file
 buffers
 perfix
  
etc.
 I am guessing there will be a particular form of these commands i should use.
 TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I don't have a lot experience with emacs and so I am pretty sure I am doing something wrong here as this is simply too tedious...
 What I am trying to do is to attach a file without a mouse, just by using a keyboard.
 Currently this is how it looks like:
 I want to attach a file to I press C-c c-a to open the attachment-dispatcher where I press another "a". This gives me a prompt at the bottom. I now press "tab" and the prompt tells me (I write this from memory) something about "not unique", so I press "tab" another time and now I get a new windows where I can select a file - but this window does not have focus. So I now press C-x o to switch to this window where I finally can select the file to attach...
 I find this extremely clumsy - so could someone please let me know how to properly attach a file using only a keyboard?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Jetbrains Inttelij Idea / NeoVim user here. I'm thinking about installing Emacs (org-mode is the main selling point) and switching (at least from NeoVim) to Emacs/Doom Emacs. While I was reading about how to install it, I found that there are a couple of different emacs releases that can be installed: 
  
If I search Homebrew for the "Emacs" term, there is one cask called "emacs", let's call it "standard".
 But there is also "emacs-plus" which should be first tapped: https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus?tab=readme-ov-file
  
I have a couple of questions: 
  
I'm wondering what is the "correct" way to install emacs on MacBook Pro M1 with Sonoma - standard or plus release.
 If emacs-plus is the correct way should I include those additional flags like "--with-native-comp" and if yes which ones?
 If emacs-plus is the correct way, what is better to use "emacs-plus@29" or just use the latest version? I guess that if I just use the latest version, then it will be updated whenever I run brew update and upgrade, and I'm not sure how things are going in emacs world with those updates. I used to have problems with NeoVim updates, as well as plugin updates, so at one point in time, I was afraid to run plugin updates :) Hope Emacs is more stable.
  
Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like this should be pretty obvious, but i'm pulling my hair out on the order of operations here.
 I want to customize some faces with a box. And i want that box to use a color from my current theme. But i don't want to hard code the color value, but for it to use the dark or light color of the modus theme, depending on which is loaded on starting.
 So far i have tried using the function modus-themes-get-color-value but it doesn't seem to be available at the point the tab-line gets activated. Then i tried this at the very end of my init.el:
 (custom-set-faces '(tab-line ((t (:box (:line-width (5 . 5) :color ,(face-background 'tab-line)))))) ) 
 Which seems to be run before the theme is loaded, as i'm getting a white box on the modus-vivendi theme.
 I tried setting this up in a use-package statement for the tab-line-mode, for the modus theme and for the emacs pseudo package. I tried adding :after (modus-themes) to the use-package statement for the tab-line. All without success. I don't even want it to track the theme when i change it after starting emacs. Just, get the background of the tab-line at start, after the modus-theme is loaded and use that for the box color.
 I feel like i'm somehow overthinking this. How can i get the tab-line border to look right regardless of the configured theme? Is this a case of having to set up a variable for your theme and then making this into a cond statement with hardcoded Color Values? This should work for now, but would mean i'd have to rewrite the any time i want to change themes.
 Just for completeness, here's the entire config, if anyone want's to take a look:

 When I run it with C-c C-c I get the error

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted about using outline-mode for elisp about 5 years ago and I've gone a bit potty since then on folding most everything I work with - to the extent that I've even dropped most org-mode usage to outline-mode as I never really used the funky stuff (like agenda, todo etc).
 The motivation is that it makes viewing, organising and editing these files so much easier without the need to maintain +BEGIN/END SRC blocks and the tangling that comes with using org mode.
 I've also implemented the imenu index stuff so that I can have an alphabetic index to my headings.
 So far, I've converted elisp mode, org mode, sway, i3wm and waybar configurations to be folding with outline mode. The dotfiles are in my gitlab repo.

 I am using diff-hl and having a weird issue - in a repository I am unable to stage hunks of files that are not in the root directory of a git project. I am getting an error message when calling `(diff-hl-stage-diff (current-buffer))` or just calling the `diff-hl-stage-current-hunk` interactive function. 
 error
 Now, as you can see from the screenshot, the `git apply ...` tries a temp file but the path is relative to the root of the project instead of the file that I am in.
 I traced it back to vc-git-command but am not proficient in elisp so can't make sense of it.
 Has anyone encountered a similar issue?

 If each iteration in a functional program is a recursive function call, would it result in n levels of recursion and hence O(n) space usage in the stack? This seems pretty absurd but I can't find any resources on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used doom emacs for a while, but over the last couple of weeks wrote my own config, to be a bit more flexible.
 I want to use org-agenda, and in doom emacs I just let it check all my files under "~/org/", so I can create TODOs everywhere and don't have to think about what I should be putting in which todo file - or manage a single one.
 To achieve this, I have the following lines in my init.el:
 emacs-lisp (use-package org :pin org :commands (org-capture org-agenda) :config ;; agenda (setq org-agenda-start-with-log-mode t) (setq org-log-done 'time) (setq org-log-into-drawer t) (setq org-directory "~/org/") (setq org-agenda-files '("~/org/"))) 
 I always run emacs as a daemon, and this is annoying for two reasons: 1. My recentf history is always filled with org files. I want them there, but not if they were opened by the org-agenda scan 2. I have a lot of org buffers initially
 How can I solve this? Or am I doing something which is not intended? I had the same setup in doom emacs, but never noticed that my recentf history or my buffers are spammed with agenda files. I want the agenda files on startup to work with the emacs-dashboard. I'm somewhat confused that this is not a more common problem, as I'm not sure how else I should be using org-agenda
 What I tried so far
  
do not keep org-agenda-files open after generating agenda I don't understand that quiet though, I don't want a solution that closes buffers when I close the agenda buffer
 Prevent recentf from being flooded - Reddit I neither want to ignore all my org files though

 I have a huge org file, and I get this error "end of file during parsing".
 This usually means I have parenthesis not matching somewhere, I started removing the chapters of my files one by one, and retried to tangle: no change, I got the same error everytime, this does not make sense to me, I should have been able to tangle at some point!!
 I tried with a diff (I have a backup of this file), but I am not good at reading diff buffers (and I only discovered difftastic yesterday... that I can not implement, due to the error...).
 It forces me to get better at dealing with changes in my configuration ==> I will better document the changes from now on (Magit)
 Now to my question:
 Is there an emacs function that checks code blocks only, ignoring the litterate content? Using the #+BEGIN_SRC and #+END_SRC entries to locate the blocks, and only checking the content for syntax errors?
 Thanks for your support!!

 So I finally just went with VS code. I want to go back to my emacs EXWM full setup. Any recommendations on how I can handle the language support part?
 Note: spacemacs support for EXWM was not so good. Or it might just be my inexperience with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever thought to yourself, why should I give Emacs commands like a plebian, when an LLM can just control Emacs for me? Well the first step is now done, we now have a way to make any elisp command callable by an LLM that does function calling. For example, here is me switching buffers by telling the LLM to switch buffers by just describing the buffer I want switched to. It's not exactly a huge time-saver, but it's cool and shows the potential.
 ​
 https://i.redd.it/fy6jnbp2w1kc1.gif
 In my llm package, I've created a new function calling branch after learning that Ollama will soon support function calling. Right now both Open AI and Gemini do this (but Gemini has some limitations). As part of that, I have a utility to use function calling to create function definitions for elisp functions (which aren't really rich enough in information to be passed to function calls as-is).
 I'll be thinking about interesting new interactions that can be built off by having the LLM just control emacs via a few predefined commands. But it's quite useful for certain things where you want the LLM to produce structured information. For example, I created a function that will create an example sentence given a word in a language, and then it can be passed to anki, etc. These things were a bit painful to do previously.
 As normal, I'm not planning on creating an actual end-user package here, but I want to encourage people to think about what can be done using function calling and, if there is something you want to put into a package, use the `llm` package to make it easy and portable (somewhat). Ideas and feedback are most welcome!

 I want to load a custom theme (aircon-theme) which is available at list-packages. I have created a folder called el inside .emacs.d In the el folder I have a core folder which has a theme.el file whose content is

 In the init.el , I refer to the theme via

 I was hoping this would auto-load the theme. However this only downloaded the aircon-theme, which I then selected manually using the drop down menu.

 Can someone point out why this method was not sucessful and what can be done to autoload the theme?

 (defun burly--bookmark-window-state-hack (&optional _)

 (cl-assert burly--window-state)
 (window-state-put burly--window-state (frame-root-window)))
 (setf bookmark-after-jump-hook (delete #'burly--bookmark-window-state-hack bookmark-after-jump-hook)
 burly--window-state nil)))
 I could not figure out the function argument, "_". The function body does not reference it. The argument's name seems to be intentionally non-descriptive.
 I Googled for information about Emacs and the underscore character but found nothing helpful. Then I asked ChatGPT, which replied:
 ​
  
In Emacs Lisp, when the underscore _ character is used as an argument to a function, it conventionally indicates that the argument is not used within the function body. This is a way to signal to other programmers that the argument is intentionally ignored or not relevant to the function's operation.
  
If the argument is intentionally ignored, at it seems to be, why include it in the first place? Especially when the argument is &optional anyway? What does it add to the function?

  #include <stdio.h> void main(){ printf(const char *, ...) }  Which puts my cursor on the first argument.
 But if I type in pri in Python and select print it just completes the word without even adding the parenthesis at the end. As a more complete example, I am working with a postgresql database and I type in 
  connection = psycopg2.con  and it completes it to connection = psycopg2.connect but without parens and it also doesn't add in the arguments like how C does with printf. Is this an lsp limitation with Python? I am using an up to date company mode and lsp mode with pyright as my python lsp and clangd as my C lsp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 I'm facing strange problem and couldn't figure out.
 Whenever I turn on jinx-mode in latex buffer, auctex (e.g. LaTeX-mode) automatically turned off and switched to latex-mode.
 Same issue occurs when I turn on jinx-mode globally.
 jinx-mode is perfectly working in other major-mode and auctex also works fine if jinx-mode is not turned on. 
 I tried to reinstall both packages and config them with many different settings
 but still no luck. 
 These are part of my configs. What am I missing?
 (use-package auctex :demand t :ensure (auctex :pre-build (("./autogen.sh") ("./configure" "--without-texmf-dir" "--with-packagelispdir=./" "--with-packagedatadir=./") ("make")) :build (:not elpaca--compile-info) ;; Make will take care of this step :files ("*.el" "doc/*.info*" "etc" "images" "latex" "style") :version (lambda (_) (require 'tex-site) AUCTeX-version))) (use-package latex :ensure nil :mode ("\\.tex\\'" . LaTeX-mode) :after auctex :config (setq-default TeX-master nil) (setq-default TeX-command-extra-options "--shell-escape")) (use-package jinx :demand t :bind ([remap ispell-word] . jinx-correct) :hook (emacs-startup . global-jinx-mode) :config (setq jinx-languages "en") (set-face-attribute 'jinx-misspelled nil :underline '(:color "#ffcc00" :style wave)))

 Is it possible to manually select which files go into each project? Example:
 I have following project strucutre:
 myproject/ 
 -----------/.git 
 -----------/mynotes.org 
 -----------/scripts/ 
 -----------/tests/ 
 -----------/logs/ 
 -----------/data/
 that's the most logical dir set-up and most conveniet way to access file for me most of the time.
 However sometimes say i am working on "pull_rss_feeds" part of my project and need to access related files in scripts, tests, logs, data folders. So is there a way to manually create project pull_rss_feeds and tell exactly what files i want to be part of this projects?
 Another use case is my emacs config. Part of config is in my emacs folder, part is in .emacs.d folder... I would like to manually create emacs project and tell exactly where files are.

 In order to install these language servers, I tried to use npm but I'm not very familiar with it. In particular, if I don't want to install them using root privileges, what should I do? npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted for example, attempts to install everything in /usr/local/lib/node_modules.
 I also tried npm install --save vscode-langservers-extracted to get all packages in a folder but have no idea how to hook it with Eglot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr: what i want is fuzzy find my way through my projects, and then after choosing one, all the buffers or terminals get re-opened from last time.
 if you don't know projectile. it's basically a package that let's you index all your project directories so that later you can just fuzzy find your way to what you want to work on.
 so you look for the project -> tap enter -> then you will be prompted to choose the file from inside that project.
 this is great. but if i close emacs and then i open it again (for whatever reason) i have to look for and re-open the same files i was working on.
 i guess what i need is a way to fuzzy find through my projects (like in projectile) but instead of prompting with choosing a file (after i pick a project) it will re-open the same buffers that were opened last time.
 ps: i sort of asked about this before but i think that i didn't communicate my issue properly.
 thanks

 Let me describe my problem: i installed typescript-language-server protocol on emacs and via npm (don't know why it's required btw, installing both for my system and emacs).
 After 5-6 hours strulling i did it ! I got it working, now i can select any .js file in my react folder, i can activate lsp by "C-x lsp", works totally great until i move on another .js file. The language server works for only one file i'm currently on, i need to enable it for every .js file and that's odd. Can you help me ? Thanks in advance !
 Edit: Thank you u/Bortolo_II , i solved the problem by adding (add-hook 'js-mode-hook 'lsp) to my ~/.config/doom/config.el file then did doom sync and everyting is fine now !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been a sporadic Emacs user. it has been my fav text editor. I love its infinite extensibility compared to alternatives like Vim. However I have been wondering if Emacs is on its way down.
 I guess it all started with the birth of NeoVim about a decade back. The project quickly grew and added features which made it better of an IDE than stock Vim (I think). Now i know Vim is not designed to be an IDE, but many NeoVim users seem to want that functionality. Today neovim has plugins t not only code and autocomplete, but also debug code in most languages. i lbelieve it has been steadily attracting users of stock Vim (and of course Emacs)
 Then enter, VSCode about 6 years ago. I guess this project attracted a lot of users from aother text editors (including Emacs). Today it has an extension for everything. Being backed by microsoft means its always going to be better.
 Now whenever I try to look up solutions for Emacs issues on the web, most posts i see are at least 10 years old. For example, I googled for turning Emacs into a web dev IDE. A lot of reddit and Stackoverflow posts that the search turned up were more than a decade old.
 I am wondering if Emacs is on a steady decline . The fact that it is not available by default on many systems seems to be an additional nail in its grave. Even on this sub, a lot of Emacs lovers who used to post regularly, like redguardfoo and Xah are no longer active
 This makes me sad. I absolutely hate having to install a browser disguised as a text editor (VS Code) which will be obsolete probably by another 5 years. I hope that Emacs stays around. Its infinite extensibility is what i love the most (and of course elisp) 
 Would like to hear your thoughts

 Wonder why can't be tables (+NAME blocks) be foldable by default? There is so many posts on stackoverflow, etc about it.
  
Original OP: Hello everyone!
 I use org tables with +NAME: field and usually no code block, example
 +NAME: mytable1
 | | col1 | col2 | col3 |
 | row1 | 5 | 10 | aaa |
 | row2 | 10 | 20 | bbb |
 | row3 | 10 | 40 | ccc |
 and i need to be able to fold them. I searched through different solutions online, and seems all stoped working due to recent org update.

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
I'm adventuring on the path of a project-filled life. I'm using my ZK to document and reflect on ideas and progress centered around a project-filled life. I'm coming to this late in life; I'm 67, but that doesn't matter. I'm here now, and I've started. We'll see.
Why create a routine of short knowledge cycles, because it's a simple process of recording and reviewing.
I'm looking at OpenAI's ChatGPT as a tutor for exploring ideas.
I'm using my ZK to explore what it means to have an intellectual life.
Things I'm reading:
Sertillanges, A. G. and Ryan, Mary. The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods. 1987.
Zentner, Jeff. The Serpent King. First Ember edition, Ember, an imprint of Random House Children’s Books, a division of Penguin Random House LLC, 2017.
Gardner, Dwight. Upstairs Delicatessen: on eating, reading, reading about eating, and eating while reading. 2024.
Ogawa, Yōko, et al. The Housekeeper and the Professor. Unabridged, Tantor Audio, 2013.
Music I'm listening to:
Fragmente by Felix Rösch
SUSS
Jessy J
Hania Rani
Niklas Paschburg
Ludovico Einaudi
A look at this week's ZK work themes:

The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of Emacs, there's a perennial debate between purists who swear by Emacs' native keybindings and those who find solace in the familiarity of Vim keybindings through Evil Mode. Proponents of Emacs keybindings argue for their extensibility and deep integration with Emacs' ecosystem, while advocates of Evil Mode tout its efficiency and the muscle memory carried over from Vim.
 For those who've made the switch, what are your experiences with either Emacs keybindings or Evil Mode? Did you find one to be more intuitive or productive than the other? How seamless was the transition from Vim to Evil Mode within Emacs? And for Emacs veterans, do you find that sticking to Emacs keybindings offers advantages that outweigh the allure of Evil Mode?
 Share your thoughts, tips, and insights on navigating the Emacs keybindings vs. Vim (Evil Mode) dilemma in Emacs, and help others find their preferred path to a more efficient editing experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get stack traces from a live running GHC (version 9.2.2) compiled Haskell program. 
 I understand I need to send SIGQUIT to the process to get the stacktraces of the currently running threads.
 But everytime I do this I just get the message: "This build does not support backtraces."
 This is what I have done:
  
Our build is using nix, so I've added the following to the overrides for the GHC build:
  
 ghc = old.ghc.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: { configureFlags = oldAttrs.configureFlags ++ ["--enable-dwarf-unwind"]; buildInputs = oldAttrs.buildInputs ++ [pkgs.elfutils]; }); 
  
I've added the following flags to all the builds of our packages:
  
 -ticky -g -fprof-auto -fprof-auto-calls 
  
I added the flag --enable-debug-info to the cabal build command. 
  
I don't know what else to do. The docs say:
  
On POSIX-compatible platforms GHC’s runtime system (when built with libdw support) will produce a stack trace on stderr when a SIGQUIT signal is received
  
It doesn't say here how to build with libdw support, but I read somewhere elsewhere that one needed to add --enable-dwarf-unwind, and indeed when I did that the GHC build initially complained about not being about to find the libdw library until I added elfutils to the buildInputs.
 The error message also doesn't make it clear whether the build of GHC doesn't support backtraces or the build of my executable doesn't support backtraces. Which makes hunting this down even more difficult.
 What am I missing? Is there anyway to ask GHC whether it's compiled with libdw support so I can at least work out whether the problem is with the GHC build or the build of my executable?
 (x-post from https://discourse.haskell.org/t/how-to-get-stack-traces-out-of-ghc-executables/8844 sorry I'm not sure the best place for these questions)

 I recently used Haskell for the 2023 Advent of Code and fell in love with it. I’d love to work more with Haskell professionally, but it doesn’t seem widely used in Web Development.
 Folks using Haskell professionally: what’s your role/industry? How did you get into that type of work? Do you have any advice for someone interested in a similar career?
 Edit: thanks for all the responses so far! It's great to see Haskell being used in so many diverse ways! It's my stop-looking-at-screens time for the night, so I wish you all a good night (or day as the case may be). I really appreciate everyone for sharing your experiences and I'll check in with y'all tomorrow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After reading and experimenting I'm about 99% sure this just isn't possible. Basically, I was trying to lift the api version into the type system to clean up some code so that the focus of the code was on the business logic instead of determining what api version to use in a bunch of places / passing around a isV1 boolean everywhere. This does mean that the api version would need to be determined at runtime, and nothing I've tried has made it able to get the client implicitly. I thought with everything sealed and having implicit defs for both of V1/V2 that it would work, but I'm guessing type erasure / something with subtyping makes it indeterminable. I tried classtags and the aux pattern, but couldn't get it to work. This is scala 2.12 btw. I have something like this:
 sealed trait ApiVersion object ApiVersion { sealed trait V1 extends ApiVersion sealed trait V2 extends ApiVersion } sealed trait ApiClient[Version <: ApiVersion] class V1Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] class V2Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] object ApiClient { implicit def v1Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] = new V1Client implicit def v2Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] = new V2Client } abstract class WrapperDomainObject { type Version <: ApiVersion } object WrapperDomainObject { def apply(thing: ApiThing) = if (/* some business logic */) new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version = ApiVersion.V1 } else new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version = ApiVersion.V2 } } class Service { def serviceFn(thing: WrappedDomainObject)(implicit client: ApiClient[thing.Version]) = client.doBusinessThing } 
 Is this possible?

How do you find notes and chain of thoughts without backlinks, when your ZK grows up?
TL;DR
My ZK is about 455 notes (some atomic, some literature, etc...).
But reading your past threads a question arose in my mind: what happens when my ZK grows bigger, say hundreds or
Furthermore, I realise that the more I get accustomed to backlinks, the more I'm dependent on specific tools such as Obsidian (not all Markdown editors have backlinks).
That is, I'd like to move to IA Writer, that I like much more: it has wikilcnks, but not backlinks.
Hope it makes sense.
Thank you!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently trying to save my org files after every change. I know this might be sub optimal but I want to finish this at least for the purpose of learning how to do something like this.
 So my approach was to add a hook for org mode that adds a hook for after-change-functions. Unfortunately this is active for all files once I've opened an org file. This is the code
 (defun savebuf(begin end length) (if (and (buffer-file-name) (buffer-modified-p)) (save-buffer))) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda() (add-hook 'after-change-functions 'savebuf))) 
 So I added another hook for major mode changes to remove the after-change-functions hook like this
 (defun leave-org-mode-function() (when (eq major-mode 'org-mode) (lambda() (remove-hook 'after-change-functions 'savebuf)))) (add-hook 'change-major-mode-hook 'leave-org-mode-function) 
 Unfortunately this doesn't seem to work. The first hook still stays active and saves everything regardless of major mode. Any Ideas how I could make this work?

 I've profiled the functions listed in kill-emacs-hook and the problematic function is ac-comphist-save. This function writes out a file: ~/.emacs.d/ac-comphist.dat, which on my system is approximately 73K. I searched and found an exchange about someone having the same problem on an older version of emacs on linux, and the only offered solution was to remove ac-comphist-save from kill-emacs-hook.

Here's a concept for thinking outside the box, beyond the confines of one's own thoughts. The key to a wide array of solutions lies in adapting well-known principles or frameworks from established sciences or schools of thought.

Can you re-find your own solutions to improve your Zettelkasten?

 Sometimes I use VS Code for work, to understand a plugin, and just to explore.
 Window splitting in VS Code drives me nuts. Window management is too closely tied up with tabs. You end up with an hierarchy of "Editor Groups" and "Editors" instead of being able to recall any buffer wherever you want. Then Quick Open (buffer switcher) opens a file multiple times—one per Editor Group. Using VS Code's `revealIfOpen` option partially addresses this, but reveals in the previous Editor Group—it can't recall the file into the Editor Group your cursor is currently in like in Emacs.
 We added `revealIfOpenInActiveGroup` to fix this. This allows you to make VS Code work just like Emacs buffers. Here are the docs for the Get Started page in VS Code docs:
 ### Simulating Buffers
 If you're coming from buffer-centric editors such as Emacs or vi, you can emulate that workflow with:
 "workbench.editor.showTabs": "single",
 "workbench.editor.revealIfOpen": true,
 "workbench.editor.revealIfOpenInActiveGroup": true,
 "workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups": false,
 VS Code has a model where Editors live hierarchically within Editor Groups, and to split your screen you must use Editor Groups. Using `revealIfOpen` with `revealIfOpenInActiveGroup` causes Quick Open to move already-open Editors into the active Editor Group. This allows you to emulate buffer-centric environments—no tabs, split your screen, and you can view any Editor within any Editor Group without opening a file multiple times.

I learned the hotkeys for moving around sentences and lines, moving up and down screenfuls etc. I did a lot of looking up about Emacs and am overwhelmed on how to get out of it what I want to. I want to learn more things like those hotkeys and how Emacs can be used to edit and navigate text fast. Are there any resources for that specifically, as well as complete guides to not only Emacs itself but the whole Emacs ecosystem? Are there any lists for all the popular ecosystem things like Spacemacs and Evil mode?

 one thing that's keeping me is that i can't restore open buffers and what i was working on when opening a directory.
 in neovim it is as easy as installing a plugin an then it will work whenever you open neovim inside a directory.
 in doom emacs i found the workspace feature that i liked because it creates a new workspace whenever i use "projectile switch" but when i kill emacs all i find left is the last workspace (i don't know if i am doing anything wrong but i am using SPC TAB . which is like "M-x workspace switch to")
 i believe that i just don't know the keyword to look for my solution (because that's how i descovered Projectile too +\) )
 thanks for any help
 edit: lmao why so many down votes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there. I've been back and forth with emacs and neovim for a long while now, preferring emacs but also kind of getting wrapped around the axel a bit with lisp. But, now as I start to move back to emacs (ORG mode is just too good, and I like some of the TUI abilities elsewhere that emacs gives me) , I'm looking for if there's a generic and good way to set up LSP akin to neovim's "Mason" project, which lets me just select the languages I need and properly set everything up.
 If not, that's cool, but discoverability is still very weird in the editor world. I know how to use package managers and plan on starting a config with elpaca or straight, and then adding on evil and which-key and some doom-themes and doom-modeline, but the whole setup and configuration of various LSPs are where there's a plethora of choice and I'm curious to see how people do it.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I last rewrote my init.el a decade ago, before use-package, and now it's a giant heap of files, often one per added package to init a package, that get loaded in, along with various global settings that are adjusted through setq or function calls and then a custom.el
 And this works, but it takes some time to start emacs up....
 So I was thinking of re-doing this with the new fangled use-package all the kids are doing and was a bit dismayed to find now there are several other package managers, we went from none to plethora.
 At any rate, I was wondering what the best way to lay out an init.el was, especially regarding ordering of things like
  
loading of packages
 loading of custom.el (do I even need to explicitly load custom.el)
 setting of global settings via setq or function call
 key bindings
 other??
  
When I lay it out like this, I think that's a pretty logical way of laying it out, but is it?
 What else should be considered in laying out an init.el to make it survive the decades?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I get up four hours before work to bake, brew and grow mushrooms. There are many processes involved in each, and a lot of passive time during each process. 
 What I’ve been trying to figure out is how to automatically determine the best ordering of any given set of processes to maximize passive time, so I can free up as much of time as possible while also being more productive. How would you about accomplishing this?
 So far, I’ve got a ‘process.org’ file with a global process tag. I have a list of processes as headers, with properties like ‘TOTAL_TIME’, ‘ACTIVE_TIME’, etc. What makes it challenging is some processes need to occur sequentially and have active time between them or throughout. Like mixing flour and water, waiting, then adding yeast and doing the first fold, waiting, then folding again, waiting, then proofing and preheating oven, waiting, then baking and waiting. 
 What I’d like to be able to do is go through my process.org file and just change the TODO state to ‘NEXT’ then have the cumulative list of all processes for the next morning optimized for me.

 But sometimes there is no method available. Take converting a List to a Queue, there is no toQueue available. You can always do Queue.from and that's fine, but I'm wondering how does the to method works, does anybody have examples or is it just an internal mechanism?
 For instance, I've tried:
 (0 until 5).to(Queue[Int]) (0 until 5).to[Queue[Int]](Queue[Int]) 
 But both seem to be invalid. Any pointers? Just looking for ergonomic ways to do these conversions. One can always foldLeft or use the above-mentioned collection.from but it's less ergonomic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm basically brand new to emacs and I'm trying to use it primarily for latex. I've gotten most things to work alright but I am disappointed with the lack of autocompletion options to far. In particular, TeX-electric-escape seems to do a very poor job in my opinion. It seems like predictive-mode is the solution but I am unsure how to install it. All the links on this page https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PredictiveMode#h5o-2 seem dead and I'm unsure how else to access it. I would appreciate any help with this specific problem or advice on a potentially better way to handle autocomplete in latex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question is not emacs-specific, but I have a feeling that this technical crowd might know a path forward given how customizable emacs is.
 My new work role requires me to spend even more time in email. We use Office 365 / Exchange for our work email, so the Outlook desktop client and the webmail interface is my default interface. Often times, I send an email to a recipient, and wait for their response. The chance that they respond is low, so I always have to send a follow up note. Take this and multiply by 100 threads, which takes up a lot of my time to stay on top of things.
 What I would like to do is set up my follow-up email, and have the note sent out on a certain date if I haven't heard back yet. If the person responds before the date, the pre-written note should never be sent and could be discarded. Outlook email rules and delay send feature does not allow for such a complex scenario.
 I am aware of the Boomerang app for Gmail and Outlook, but I don't think the cost is worth it; and I don't think corporate would allow me to install that add-in in Outlook.
 I looked into Thunderbird as it has a "send later" plugin that appears to have a scripting component, which could probably work. However, I'm unable to get my work mail account to work with Thunderbird. I could probably try some more to figure out why it isn't working.
 Question for the folks in this subreddit: is there a way to achieve the email rules I described using an email client in Emacs? Or some other open source tool?
 I know this is a long shot. Thanks in advance for any insight you might provide.

 I'd've expected, since, Emacs traffics in text, there'd've been something in-built but, beyond references to ISO-639-1 for setting the style of fonts (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Fonts.html), I can't seem to find much of anything.
 Plus, any language-related stuff I find (such as the Melpa package Guess Language and https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GuessBufferLanguage) seem to roll their own (scaled down) version rather than relying on anything within Emacs or, even, a third-party library.
 Figured someone here might know of something, if there is anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please help. I have recently upgraded emacs and tried to adopt LSP & treesitter. I'm primarily working in Typescript at the moment so I'm using LSP typescript and tsx-ts-mode. Also using lsp-ui, LSP eslint, flycheck and company-mode.
 The result has become extremely frustrating as I've started to use it beyond trivial use cases. When working quickly, with many files/projects open, the following often happens:
  
make an edit quickly
 no update from language server and any stale errors remain
 tsserver process spins and spins at max CPU for about a minute
 CPU drops and the buffer finally updates... maybe?
  
It can take minutes to respond, and sometimes seems to stall indefinitely. I end up forced to `lsp-restart-server` repeatedly throughout the day. I don't think this is necessarily specifically an LSP issue, but probably some combination of things, like maybe LSP is getting confused and issuing too many requests? I have already gone through all the recommendations in `lsp-doctor` and I'm a little uncertain where to even look to diagnose further (the `*lsp-log*` doesn't contain anything illuminating) and the problem seems to get worse and worse.
 Is this a common experience? How can I see better what's going on? Any packages I should maybe look for and jettison?

 I have been trying to set up Emacs for front-end web dev work but I cant seem to get error highlighting for HTML to work. i installed packages like emmet, web, company, flymake, js2, etc and was able to get HTML tags autocompletion and indentation. But no matter what i do i cannot seem to get error highlighting for html misspelled tags which oher editors do by default. i have installed flymake and all it does is highlights tags that are left open.
 Will Doom Emacs/Spacemacs solve these configuration issues? if yes, which one would be the best? Also, is there any way to kep my current .emacs file and vanilla emacs installation without having it detected by Doom/Spacemacs?

 treesit
 When I started I was using the built-in treesit package, however I quickly realized the highlighting was fairly subpar even when the font-lock was at level 4. I looked at the doom source code and saw that they were using the old 3rd party tree-sitter package.
 tree-sitter
 Using this package seems to bring a lot more options into scope and it immediately made the highlighting better. However, I am still having trouble making it look as good as doom's highlighting (particularly in python files).

I've been using Haskell for over 15 years now, and I believe at least some of those things would make Haskell a better language to work in. I was wondering what everyone else would love to see in Haskell - informally, without the restraints of a fully formal enhancement proposal. Shoot your ideas in the replies, I'd love to hear it. Also, let me know what you think of the article. Bear in mind this is the first such article I've written in maybe 12 years, so maybe don't rip into it too much :) It's all meant to be a little informal and inspirational rather than a fully prescriptive solution to every problem.

 Recently I have to work inside some docker containers that use different toolchains, things mostly work on Emacs 29 native support for docker in Tramp, except that I now need to pass the --query-driver option to clangd to effectively index my project, somehting like this:
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '((c-ts-mode c++-ts-mode c-mode c++-mode) .

 The original post:
  
 I'd like the cursor to move as predictably as possible when I scroll. I want it to get back to the original position when I scroll up and down back and forth a few screens.
  
 There are a couple of issues with the scroll up and down functions. First, the beginning and the end of buffer are an edge case. But I can work with that. The scroll-up-command and scroll-down-command work better for me than scroll-up and scroll-down. I can write a wrapper that remembers the last good position and jumps there when I move in the opposite direction from the beginning or end. I know about all the options for these commands, incl…]]></summary>

I'm probably just missing some binding command or something, but I can't figure out what.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During experimenting with loom-based development, I wanted a rust like ?- Operator. 
 The implementation turned out to be a little bit tricky, but here it is: https://github.com/reactivecore/quest
 The tricky part is correct return type deduction, consider this:
 ```scala def operation(): Option[Int] = ???
 val result = quest { operation().? Some(12) } `` The result will beOption[Int]. If it would just look at the inner functon ofquestit would deductSome[Int]`. 
 This works using a special trait called Resulting[T] which is triggered by quest being a context function. 
 Resulting is also referenced by the question operator, thus the compiler is inferencing T to be None and Some[Int] resulting in Option[Int].
 The library triggers an early exit using Exceptions without Stacktraces. Measurements show, that this creates an overhead of ~5ns, which should be acceptable.
 Of course it won't work (and being dangerous) in lazy evaluated code (Futures, Lazy Collections, Effect Systems etc.).
 What do you think?
 Disclaimer: The base idea was already presented by Martin Odersky at Scalar Conference 2023 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fm0y4K4YO8 (which I rembered later in implementation)
 There is also an old thread.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for that difficult title, if it didn't give you a stroke, I'll give you an example of what I mean.
 So for instance, the command calendar normally reuses the current frame/window. However, with the variable calendar-setup set to two-frames, it creates two new frames, one for the calendar and one for the diary.
 This isn't the only command like this, it's just an example, and it's not even the only one I might like to solve, since I face a similar problems with some gnus workflows I want to build, so please, no specific hacks to get this particular thing to work such as suggesting I not use calendar-setup set to two-frames, I really need a generalisable solution to this.
 So the issue is, if I launch emacsclient -e '(calendar)' from a shortcut or the command-line in order to bring up my calendar, this doesn't work unless there is a pre-existing emacsclient frame.
 The solution then would seem to be to issue either emacsclient -c -e '(calendar)' or emacsclient -r -e '(calendar)' in order to create a frame first.
 The problem is this creates a totally useless frame that is both annoying, but also problematic, because you can't close it if the calendar and diary frames aren't already closed.
 What I'd like is to be able to run (calendar) and have it create its frames without the need for a pre-existing frame. Or else in a really bad pinch, have the dummy frame created but totally hidden, and have it quit the moment I close the diary and calendar frames.
 Does anybody have any ideas? I've been pulling my hair out here, I dunno if I'm missing something obvious.

 My last real attempt at an Emacs package was El Gantt which generates gantt charts from orgmode files. I written a couple other buggy things (e.g., https://github.com/legalnonsense/org-visual-outline). I am a lawyer and Emacs helps keep me sane at work. Elisp is the only language I know and only one ever want to know. 
 For the last couple years I have worked on something new. I have been using it for awhile now and think it is good enough to share: https://github.com/legalnonsense/reorg. 
 It is like taxy.el, org-ql, org-sidebar except that it’s not limited to org files and it’s messier shotgun of ideas. 
 It allows clones of outline nodes as featured in Leo Editor. This also means it can at least give the appearance of real transclusion. 
 I’ve written a readme that explains everything in a way that I hope makes sense.
 I make no guarantee that you can clone and run this error free.

 Okay, so I have this problem where I always had a few hundred buffers open in ibuffer, and I couldn’t figure out what was doing it - since YEARS. Well, I finally figured it out the other day! Org refiling was the culprit. See, I didn’t know this but whenever you refile, when it says getting all targets, it’s opening them up (at least it did in my ibuffer behind the scenes).
 To counter this, I asked an AI to help me, and it did. It wrote the code but it couldn’t get the last part right about not opening ibuffer to kill everything. I fixed that up myself. So this is a collaboration between an AI and me, but the code works.
 The only “issue” now is that if you have a lot of targets, it will take a few seconds each time to do the gathering part. For me, that’s not a big deal, …]]></summary>

 I worked past 6 months with different stack (JS/TS), and now got a chance to do little Scala 3 again. It's so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes. Really, it does.
 Small things you easily forget, and notice when they are gone (just to mention few): syntax ergonomics, pattern matching, compiler & macros working for you, powerful std library and amazing ecosystem of libraries that make Scala also practical to build real projects with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[org-mode defines a serious number of keys in org-mode-map, some of which I want to use for my own nefarious purposes. There's org-disputed-keys which is supposed to stop org-mode from squatting on them. The trouble is, it doesn't always seem to work.
 For example, I want to use C-M-<left/right/up/down> globally to move the point to the window in those directions (with windmove) and I want to use C-M-S-<left/right/up/down> globally to move the window itself in those directions (using my own defun).
 org-mode squats on those shifted C-M-S- keys, and you would think that this would fix it:
 (setq org-replace-disputed-keys t) ;; restart emacs after changing any of these: (setq org-disputed-keys '(([(kbd "C-M-S-<right>")] . [( nil )]) ([(kbd "C-M-S-<left>")] . [( nil )]) ([(kbd "C-M-S-<up>")] . [( nil )]) ([(kbd "C-M-S-<down>")] . [( nil )]) <plus many other keys that I want to use and for which org-disputed-keys works fine eg> ([(kbd "C-,")] . [( nil )]) 
 This works fine on other keys that org-mode would otherwise occupy, such as C-' but not on C-M-S-<left/right> so I have to resort (in org-mode-hook) to a heavy-handed:
 (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-M-S-<left>") nil) (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-M-S-<right>") nil) 
 Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? Or is it a bug in org-mode?
 I don't use org-mode very much (mainly for elfeed-dashboard) preferring the much simpler outline-minor-mode (plus a few hacks) but I do want org-mode buffers/windows to behave themselves with my window moving global keys.

 I tested to open tramp like `/ssh:matt@192.168.1.10:/home/matt/code/` and it open the dir, but I can't for example seek project files. Also I use devenv (nix) to load the needed tools, but even if I open vterm and execute it, the main process doesn't have it. so I can't run things like tests. 
 Is there other way to use it ? or any tutorial in how to configure?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have functions that return an Either[Exception,List[Path]]. I would like to do something like
 val res:Either[Exception,List[Path]] = for { path1:Path <- ListT(foo1()) path2:Path <- ListT(foo2(path1)) path3:Path <- ListT(foo3(path)) } yield path3 
 I've found https://typelevel.org/cats/faq.html#where-is-listt but when I try to use Nested in my for-comprehension. I get compile failures.
  
value flatMap is not a member of cats.data.Nested[[B] =>> Either[Exception, B], List, java.nio.file.Path]
  
I've tried adding cats syntax imports to no success. I'm fairly certain this monadic transform style should be doable for a basic collection. Any help or guidance is appreciated. Thank you!!
 EDIT: I wrote this code to hold the spot, until better code comes. For now this may be useful to others. I took advantage of the fact I'm only using Either[Exception,List[_]]. The example code basically runs as it. Maybe someone somewhere finds this useful too!
 import scala.annotation.tailrec class ListT[A](val run:Either[Exception,List[A]]) { def flatMap[B](func:A=>ListT[B]):ListT[B]= run match { case Right(list) => @tailrec def churn(remainder:List[A])(accum:List[B]):ListT[B]= remainder match { case Nil => ListT(Right(accum)) case head::tail => val intermediate = func(head) intermediate.run match { case l:Left[Exception,List[B]] => intermediate case Right(list) => churn(tail)(list++accum) } } churn(list)(Nil) case l:Left[Exception,_] => this.asInstanceOf[ListT[B]] } def map[B](func:A=>B):ListT[B]= run match { case l:Left[Exception,List[A]] => l.asInstanceOf[ListT[B]] case Right(list) => ListT(Right(list.map(func))) } }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently doing the #48in24 challenge on Exercism and it has me try to solve the same exercises in many different languages in quick succession, usually ones I need to discover on the spot. This means finding out what features are available in the language itself and in the libraries.
 And this made me realize how lucky I am to work with Haskell! Aside from how featureful the language itself is, I'm baffled by how many languages have abysmal documentation on the standard library. At least the statically typed ones almost always tell you the types of argument and return value… Quite often, I need to experiment in the REPL to understand what exactly some function or method does.
 This is in stark contrast with Haskell, where I I'm used to read the documentation and have every function explained in detail.
 I also find myself reinventing the wheel a lot less with Haskell. Modules like Data.List or Data.Text provide a wider selection of commonly needed operations that almost any other language I tried!

 Loading data into widgets and saving widget data to a file 
 # Background
 Hi team,
 I'm looking to create a handy little tool for some specific tabletop RPG games (DND-like, Call of Cthulu, Deadlands) and I would like to know if anyone has any ideas for how to get data from a markdown language (such as a .yaml file) into a widget screen and then save from the widget screen back into the file again. 
 My current idea is that I could use an emacs form after running a program to parse the data from the .yaml file, but that eliminates my ability to use the fun widget library in emacs (which has the nice features of checkboxes and buttons). So I would like to be able to have my widget 'UI', and load the data from the yaml file interactively, so that I can save back to it as well.
 I've been trying to find the source code for the customize buffer in emacs, which does essentially what I want to do, but my grepping has been to no avail.

 I've seen about half a dozen pages explain this in various ways, but none are very easy to set up, and they don't get too much into specifics about whether it is two-way syncing (which is what I wish for) or not.
 In short: Does anyone have a solution that is fairly easy to set up?
 EDIT: I have tried org-caldav with my NextCloud setup, but it's not working entirely correctly and I'm not certain why. It syncs from the calendar on the server, but not to it. Also, NextCloud appears to be a bit buggy at times as I found it difficult to delete the test calendars at times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an init.el pretty much unchanged since 2010 or so. So I've declared emacs init bankruptcy and am starting over.
 I've installed the latest stable version of emacs (29.2) and am using an init.el generated by https://emacs.amodernist.com/
 I am not sure this is the latest and greatest kind of init, I notice it does not use any use-package
 One big change between then and now is the introduction of the nongnu repository and I see that it's automatically listed in the package-archives of emacs 29.2.
 What's it state?
 Do I need melpa at all?
 If I do need melpa for packages not yet in gnu or nongnu, how do I add melpa in so that it's priority is last on the list?
 Right now I have:
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t) (setq package-archive-priorities '((gnu . 10) (nongnu . 5) (melpa . 1))) 
 But even so, when I m-x list-packages I can see that emacs wants to upgrade the nongnu packages to the ones in melpa.
 As an example
 the version of the avy package in melpa is 20230420.404
 but in nongnu the version is 0.5.0
  
When installing packages, the package with the highest version number from the archive with the highest priority is selected. When higher versions are available from archives with lower priorities, the user has to select those manually.
 Archives not in this list have the priority 0, as have packages that are already installed. If you use negative priorities for the archives, they will not be upgraded automatically.
  
Since the version numbers of nongnu and melpa differ so widely, it seems as if there is no way to just set package archive priority such that it will default to nongnu
 Any advice?
 Suggestions on using melpa or not?
 Suggestions if using melpa how to get it to be used only when packages are not found in gnu or nongnu?

 But on new linux distros you can't install tinytag via pip and your system python package. You have to install it into a virtual environment. 
 My question is, on new linux distros how do I set emms to use tinytag as installed in a python virtual environment? Do I activate the virtual environment and then set emms-info-tinytag-python-name to the path of python in the virtual environment?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Preface
 One of the most important topics in IT is surely the security, it's so complicated and intriguing that, either you love it or you hate it, but we can't help taking care of it. Nowadays, in a society based on computers and applications, crackers attacks are very concrete and dangerous. In my opinion, when we talk about IT security, it is always better to overestimate the risk and have a large margin of tolerance. The (hard) trade-off we have to make is that the solution is usable, has good performance, and is safe.
  
Often, it is not a single solution that makes something safe; it is the sum of several approaches that mitigate the risk.

 It has been a while since I had my first idea for a library that would help developers securely manage secret values within their app…]]></summary>

 Here is an example of what I mean:
 | col1 | col2 | col3 | col4 | | test | 1 | | | | test2 | 5 | -4 | 6 | | test3 | 4 | 1 | 9 | #+TBLFM: @3$3..@>$3=@-1$2-@0$2::@3$4..@>$4=@-1$2+@0$2 
 In col3 I show the result of subtracting the value in col2 in the current row from the value col2 in the previous row. col4 does the same with adding the rows
 But what if I wanted to have two table. One for the input data (col1, col2) and one for the calculated data (col3, col4)
 I tried it like this
 #+TBLNAME: data | col1 | col2 | | test | 1 | | test2 | 5 | | test3 | 4 | | col3 | col4 | | | | | -4 | 6 | | 1 | 9 | #+TBLFM: @3$1..@>$1=remote(data,@-1$2)-remote(data,@0$2)::@3$2..@>$2=remote(data,@-1$2+@0$2) 
 But it throws an error that "Row descriptor -1 leads outside table". Obviously because the relative positions are not based on the second table

 So I had this interview with this big company where the interviewer was quite experienced. As they say a dev with > 15 YOE is someone who must be way too much orgasmic about Java and I have always experienced this. Now the role for which they were hiring was Full Stack Dev, however this dude started with problem solving. 
 He asked me first which language would like to pick, so I told him that I would prefer using JavaScript/C++ and then he responded oh don't you know Java? Look I don't hate Java …]]></summary>

As part of publishing, I export the notes as txt, insert them into an FTS5 SQLite table and I added a small reactive app to an existing server to search and display the results. Everything works well but I recently used docsify at work and thought it was superb so I started thinking about client-side searching. I've thought about the following:
  
modify my export to markdown, generate the appropriate sidebar file and setup docsify in the normal way. My primary objection is the markdown exporter's quality is unknown. This would also cut my publish time down significantly and wouldn't be too much work.
 index the HTML (Note: getting this only do the relevant piece was difficult the last time I tried as tags and metadata blew up the results) as part of the publishing process and add a Javascript library that gets included in every exported HTML file. We'll call this the stork model. While slightly slower than the previous option, this would also reduce publishing time substantially.
  
What other solutions occur to you?
 edit: I ended up doing the first one. It took a couple of hours to convert.

 But what about lines without soft newline characters? When I open mails in mu4e, all longer lines are nicely wrapped. The lines though that can be shown completely in the buffer stick out and are not wrapped, and this looks ugly and makes reading harder because of the long lines. (See the attached screenshot. The lines at the end are much longer than the wrapped ones above.)

 Has anyone of you found a solution for this?
 (In my system, fill-flowed-display-column is set to fill-column, and fill-column is set to 70.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have set up a simple server with scala+cask (I have set the port to 51934 and the host to be "0.0.0.0"). I was getting connection timeouts when I was trying to connect from a different PC in the local network and when I ran netstat -an | grep LISTEN I got the following output:
 ​
 tcp 0 0 127.0.0.53:530.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:6310.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:220.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:54320.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::51934 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:8212:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:45459:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:44569:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:35383:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::22 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::5432 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 ::1:631 :::* LISTEN
 ​
 Now, the third entry on that output is my ssh server which is accessible from everywhere. The first tcp6 entry is the server I am trying to set up now. I see it being listed as tcp6. So I guess I have two questions:
 - Is this an issue (that is my guess)
 - How can I configure the cask server so that it uses tcp instead of tcp6?

If dir-a and dir-b are far away from each other, this may take a lot of keystrokes.
 This could be made easier, if insert-file would allow me to jump to a bookmarked directory (which might be closer to dir-b). Do you know any such solution ?
 Please note, that in this special use-case (insert-file), the command bookmark-bmenu-list (or similar) does not provide an alternative as far as I can see.
 Thanx

They both support deconstructing ideas in a tree structure, except that mindmaps offer a spatial way of arranging items, while the outliner does it as a list. I like to mindmap first and then turn it into an outline.
 I figured out a dead simple way of doing it that doesn't involve messing around with freeplane plugins that export to Org-mode. (I tried one, it didn't work for me.) The One Downside - It only works with the nodes, not it's properties like attributes and notes.
 Step 1
  
Open Freeplane, go to Format > Manage Styles > Edit Styles (Or just hit C+f11).
 On the branch called Automatic level styles, select the top level node
 On the right side pane are the controls. Scroll down to Core Text and in the field called Format add this: * %…]]></summary>

 I'm new to programming and am learning Python!
 I decided to go with Emacs, and you might be asking why. Well, I've dabbled a bit with Emacs in the past, and I'm intrigued by its feature set, which I believe could greatly enhance my programming-fu. I'm using Termux with an external keyboard because I do not have access to a computer. Is my approach off-base? Is there a significant difference between using emacs vs emacs -nw ? Can I just stick to the vanilla setup for programming in Python?
 Your insights are greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

Being a newbie, I thought "great, lets clear those out" and I followed the instructions to delete them. On restarting this morning, I realised that the deleted packages were my Modus-themes, Golden-ratio and pdf-tools (with other pdf related files), all of which are loaded every time I start emacs and essential to my newbie workflow.
 Does emacs have a habit of suggesting that you delete files that are actually used and setup in your init.el? ..or more likely, what am I doing wrong that emacs suggested that I delete them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this question has been asked before, I want to learn Haskell and I have very little programming experience(only Python & some robotics C) and I'm conflicted at the moment.
 My roadmap is:
  
HFTVB by John Whitington or the Haskell Wikibook
 Write yourself a Scheme tutorials
 Learn Haskell by Building a Blog Generator by Gilmi.
  
Is it worth buying on HFTVB? Or is the Wikibook good enough? Or more importantly, am I being redundant since all of the above are focused on beginners? As in, would it be better to just jump into LHBG?
 By looking at the options above, you'll notice that I have:
  
A preference for text over video courses.
 A phobia from large books which I see recommended on here. I like things succinct where the questions lead me to discover more of the material and where I am left with space to figure things out for myself.
  
I know at this point this is quite a repetitive question, but I'm really interested in starting as soon as possible and would like not to go through the phase of trying out a 1000 unrelated things until I figure out which is right for me, I know my preferences and prefer sticking to them.
 I also read about LYAH, and while it seems quaint the no exercises disqualifies it immediately from the race. I like my resources jam-packed with exercises.

 I'm getting errors on the brunch command about some duplicated entries in a file. I know that these entries come from a file called "file_contexts", and I would like that specific entry in order to remove it from a proper file. But since Android codebase is massive I would like to:
  
Get all the files called "file_contexts" found. For that I could use consult-find, right?
 
Then get all these files as an input for consult-ripgrep somehow.
 
 I have absolutely no idea if this could be a possibility but hey, this is r/emacs!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR - How do I incorporate backlink searches into my org-ql queries?
 ​
 I am re-structuring my notes to adapt to new demands. I really like the non-hierarchical approach where individual notes are org-mode headers (or files) with an ID property that I can simply link to.
 Org-ql is fantastic at querying org-mode headers, keeping dynamic blocks based on those queries, etc. Using org-ql, I can also query for links within a heading. What I am missing is the option to query for backlinks TO the heading. Has anyone solved this problem?
 ​
 Simple example:
 * Drug A :drug: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 12345 :END: This is an inhibitor of [[id:54321][Protein X]]. * Protein X :protein: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 54321 :END: This is a trans-membrane protein that is over-expressed in breast cancer. 
 If I'm interested in the a subset of inhibitor drugs that are linked to Protein X I can do:
 [[org-ql-search:(and (rifle "inhibitor") (link "Protein X"))]] 
 But what about finding trans-membrane proteins are associated with (i.e. "backlinked to") inhibitors?
 ​
 OR - maybe there is a way to use org-ql results as org-ql query inputs? For example: 
  
Query 1: pull out all drugs.
 Query 2: pull out all proteins.
 Query 3: identify all proteins (from Query 2) that have a backlink to drugs (from Query 1).
  
​
 I'm a bit stuck. Any help or pointers would be appreciated.

 I noticed that a VSCode Haskell plugin expects a GHCup setup. I am thinking of forking my own code and experimenting with just using Cabal and GHCup installed tools, and also get rid of my stack.yml files in each project directory.
 A few years ago it seemed that stack removed many of the pain points I had with Haskell but now I am re-evaluating that belief.
 Any advice will be appreciated!!

After an upgrade from an earlier version of Stack, on first use only, Stack 2.15.1 may warn that it had trouble loading the CompilerPaths cache.
 The hash used as a key for Stack's pre-compiled package cache has changed, following the dropping of support for Cabal versions older than 1.24.0.0.
  
Changes since v2.13.1:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack does not leave *.hi or *.o files in the setup-exe-src directory of the Stack root, and deletes any corresponding to a setup-<hash>.hs or setup-shim-<hash>.hs file, to avoid GHC issue #21250.
 If Stack's Nix integration is not enabled, Stack will notify the user if a nix executable is on the PATH. This usually indicates the Nix package manager is available. …]]></summary>

 Howdy. I've recently gotten an "Emacs splinter" about the format of dired directory listings and after playing with dired-listing-switches I've determined there are not enough knobs there to allow me to filter out some of the stuff I want to filter out. I see that I can write some custom filters also which might take me where I want to go but my elisp skills are still somewhat meager and I have quite a lot on my plate already.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for elisp packages already in the ecosystem which might be a quick win here? More so to filter the contents of the listings and not so much, for example, colors (ex:diredfl).
 thx!

 I would like to dabble in org-brain aside from org-roam. Unfortunately the documentation is pretty thin and there are no instructions what I need to do in order to adapt it to Doom emacs. Org-brain is a flag in the doom config file, but I am pretty sure I need to set it up as well. 
 Can someone aid me in doing it? I am sure some of have done it or at least know what I need to do for adapting packages. I heard you shouldn't install as if it was vanilla emacs, but I only starting to understand what that means. 
 Thanks for your help

It is inspired by https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-project, a package for creating Common Lisp projects interactively. Similarly, a directory called skelton is provided, which acts as a template for the project. This makes the setup easy to understand. I used to search how to create an Emacs Lisp project every time I created one, but since I created this one, I don't need to do that anymore. I announced this package to the Emacs community in my country, and it was so well received that I am announcing it here on Reddit as well. I hope you will Star it if you like!

 I am aware of the command treesit-install-language-grammar but for some reason, it's unable to run properly, at least on Windows.
 Whenever I run it, it eventually fails when trying to clone the grammar repository.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the other day I spent more than 3 seconds renaming eat buffers, so I decided to spend more than 3 days to make my own package that does it automatically. After finishing, I found that if you launch eat with a prefix argument it does exactly what I wanted.
 Nevertheless, this package has more features (like updating the indexes when a buffer is closed & more formatting options) and not only it works for eat, but for everything that when launched checks if the buffer already exists and uses that instead of creating a new one (I only tested vterm and eat) so it can be used as a simple replacement to multi-vterm and multi-term.
 I really recommend the experience. I've been using emacs for about a year, and even though you do learn by making your config, making a package gives you a waaay higher level of understanding, even if it's a basic one like mine.
 I tried to make the best code I could, but I'm no elisp/lisp programmer, but a C one, so probably the style isn't exactly right. There are a few features I didn't add yet and it could be way better documented.
 Here's the link for anyone interested: https://gitlab.com/vslavkin/multi-buffer.el
 Edit: not sure if the name is good or not, please tell me if you have a better alternative

 I'm still using Emacs-w32 from Cygwin and I start it elevated:
 cygstart --action=runas run emacs-w32 
 so I can edit "privileged" files.
 I wonder if WSL's Emacs could be a "system" tool - could I ditch Cygwin completely (having X Server backported by Microsoft to Win 10)...
 It could be frustrating to switch text editor just to edit hosts file...

Given that "sir, this is Reddit" it means this is an AMA in which you can ask questions regarding Scala, Scala at VirtusLab, roadmaps of the teams involved in building and maintaining Scala and so on. I also invite you to share your and your organisation's problems, fears, blockers, and issues related to Scala and tooling around the language. I will try my best to answer your questions but I reserve the right not to answer immediately if I don't know something - I try to keep tabs on a lot of things but am far from being omniscient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I am learning haskell from this resource: https://learn-haskell.blog/04-markup/04-parsing_02.html
 and I cannot understand certain function call, I mean this one:
 maybe id (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) 
 from this block:
  parse :: String -> Document parse = parseLines Nothing . lines -- (1) parseLines :: Maybe Structure -> [String] -> Document parseLines context txts = case txts of [] -> maybeToList context -- (2) -- Paragraph case currentLine : rest -> let line = trim currentLine in if line == "" then maybe id (:) context (parseLines Nothing rest) -- (3) else case context of Just (Paragraph paragraph) -> parseLines (Just (Paragraph (unwords [paragraph, line]))) rest -- (4) _ -> maybe id (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) trim :: String -> String trim = unwords . words 
 especially this part:
 (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) 
 Let's say we call this function with context = Nothing and txts = ["abc", ""]
 so firstly we go to this case:
 maybe id (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) 
 and now is the part I don't understand, (:) context in this case is (Nothing : any list that parseLines will return) so Nothing will be prepend to a list of paragraphs, but when Im calling this function in ghci it just returns [Paragraph "abc"] without nothing, but manually calling (Nothing: [Just $ Paragraph "abc"]) returns a list with Nothing at the beginning. 
 Can someone explain this, please?

 Do you use Nix or NixOS? If so, how do you manage your own Emacs?

 The problem is as follows: I have everything set up and it runs perfectly well. I can download messages, read them, archive/delete them, etc... This is all reflected in Apple Mail in iOS and on the Mac as well. However, the Sent Mail doesn't seem to sync in the same way. If I send an email with Mu4e, it will save it to the designated "icloud/Sent Messages" locally, and I can see it in mu4e. But I can't see it in Apple Mail at all. It's simply not synced. All the other folders are except for this one. Also, Sent items from Apple Mail do not sync to mu4e either.
 Is there something that I'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the first packages I setup in emacs when I began using it were projectile and perspective. I primarily use emacs as an IDE and wanted to be able to manage different projects. Google said these were good so I started there. Two months on and I still don't have a single perspective set and projectile feels like I'm using a semi truck to tow a hand cart. I've only not removed projectile because it integrates with tree-macs and I'm hoping to set it up so that I can have tree-macs display my list of folders when I'm not working on a project and only the project root of the current working directory when I'm in a python/c++ project. Tree-macs has a variable that allows you to set it to display a single directory and I'm wondering if that can be done with a .dir-local.el file, eliminating the one thing I think would make projectile worth having. I'd also like to exclude folders with .gitignore but again, I wonder if there is a way to do that with tree-macs or project.el.
 So, my question. What do you guys use perspective and projectile for. As a hobby programmer, do you think it's worth having? What are your thoughts on project.el and what else is out there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I shared this on my blog earlier this week:
https://christiantietze.de/posts/2024/02/example-object-tag-vs-topic-tag-programming-zettelkasten/
So I talked with a fellow iOS developer about tagging recently, then overhauled a note I found by accident and shared this as an example.
The gist is:
I increased specificity of tags. The general #image  becomes → #uiimage on iOS, #nsimage on macOS, which are actual types in the macOS API.
I removed the topic tag #appkit which doesn't tell me anything interesting here.
Why is the object tag #appkit useless now? Almost all my programming notes are about macOS and thus #appkit, the macOS UI API framework. So it doesn't help find anything, and it'd produce so many notes that it becomes useless. Thousands, if applied consistently!
There are notes about the AppKit framework as a topic. These stay put, of course!
The thing is: for my very first notes on programmatic image manipulation, it sounded sensible to use a tag like #image.  After all, I did not expect to need specificity here at all: "something with image in Appkit" sounded good. But with expertise, I need NSImage-related resources, and I can name contexts better. Like embedding images in text views, as wirh The Archive 
All notes are malleable, so no problem.
By the way, new notes on similar topics I tag with the very specific API titles right away, e.g. #nsimage for image stuff on Mac. This changed in the past couple of years and I don't have to think about this, at all. I believe it felt similar back when I used the """bad""" tag. So chances are I could discover even more specific tags in the future and find the current one lacking   At the moment, it's the best topic tag I know to describe this.]]></summary>

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
I am exploring the idea of when my body is in motion and when it is at rest, it interacts with inertia.
How do I modify the format of my wikilinks to something more generic? I feel for @ZettelDistraction's pain, and he modified his file names and the links in his ZK. Just the thought of attempting this hurts my little brain.
I'm thinking about adulting my Monk Mornings.
I use my ZK in support of my university literature and writing coursework.
Things I'm reading:
Quintero, Isabel. Gabi, a girl in pieces. 2014.
Picard, Max. The world of silence. 1948.
Gardner, Dwight. UPSTAIRS DELICATESSEN: on eating, reading, reading about eating, and eating while reading. 2024.
Yoon, Nicola. The sun is also a star. 2016.
Music I'm listening to:
Schiller
Kaleo
Hania Rani
A look at my ZK work themes:
1/19 zettel - meta zettelkasting
★★★★★
The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

 When I try to use them though, I get an error: "all-the-icons isn't installed"
 Now, I know all-the-icons isn't installed. The reason is because it was apparently taken out of Doom Emacs in favor of "nerd-icons" which I had to install instead when first setting up Doom. But from this error message, I'm gathering that Neotree needs, or at least is specifically looking for, all-the-icons.
 Is there a way to tell Neotree to use the icons from the font I have installed? It just won't even turn on at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently setting up my capture templates and want to do the following.
  
Create a file if it doesn't exist yet
 Give it a level 1 heading of the current date
 Give it two level 2 headings "Journal" and "activities"
 Have one capture template that creates entries under "Journal" and another one that creates entries uner "activities"
  
I have 1 - 3 implemented and everything works so far. My problem is 4. My capture template for "Journal" looks like this:
 ("ja" "Journal" entry
 (file+olp (lambda()(rmz/create-org-file)) (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d") "Journal")
 "* %<%H:%M %p> - %?")
 So the first thing in the target is a call to a function that creates the file if it doesn't exist and then returns the file name (works). Then I want to create the olp. The level 1 heading needs to be created dynamically while the second ("journal") is static. This is what the documentation says about it:
 (file+olp "path/to/file" "Level 1 heading" "Level 2" ...)
 For non-unique headings, the full outline path is safer
 If I only add "Journal" as olp in the target emacs throws the error "Heading not found on level 1: Journal" (Sounds different in the documentation)
 If I pass the call to format-time-string emacs throws this error "Wrong type argument: stringp, (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")
 Any ideas how I can pass a dynamic heading in the targets olp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not entirely certain this is doable, but would love to be proven wrong. I know how to use space-mark in combination with whitespace-display-mapping to convert ALL spaces to a dot, but in all honesty, that isn't really helpful. I would rather like to be able to call out spaces that appear before tabs, and also spaces that appear after tabs.
 If I simply use space-before-tab and space-after-tab, without space-mark, I am able to see these spaces because they have a different background color (I modified my theme)... but that all goes away when my cursor goes to the line where these spaces are (I have global-hl-line-mode on). I'd like to have these spaces still be visible in this case, preferably with a space-mark. Is this achievable?

 Realistically nobody needs doctor, tetris, several git interfaces, etc. If they do, they can always install them, which is ultimately what it is all about; to pick and choose and build your own environment. It should come bundled with the bare minimum and allow users to pick and choose which packages they want and need IMO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did an "update all" from melpa today and one or more upgrades breaks a lot of functionality for me. It broke things both on emacs 29 running on manjaro i3 and on emacs 28 running in pop os so it doesn't seem a version related issue. The first thing I noticed, for instance, is that which-key stopped working, despite "which-key" not being one of the packages upgraded. Is there a way to narrow down the culprit?
 This was the list of packages to upgrade:
 (auctex-14.0.0 company-20240208.1943 doom-modeline-20240205.139 flycheck-20240208.2142 helm-descbinds-20240206.802 magit-20240206.2256 mastodon-20240201.1500 org-noter-20240207.2329 org-ref-20240208.1801 transient-20240201.1100 visual-fill-column-20240205.1505).
 Is there a way to upgrade each one in turn and see which one is interfering with the others? For some reason I'm confused how to just upgrade one package in melpa at a time. It only seems possible to install a newer version over an older.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming from an OOP background, I'm finding it difficult to write elisp, for Emacs. I've tried looking for guides, but I haven't found information on how to structure the code of a coherent package.
 Particularly, it's been hard for me to keep track of the code in my mind because I'm using mostly plain functions and not many data structures. And the code is so far in one big file, which I don't know how to split up, as opposed to classes, which are more conceptually modular. How should I make my code more modular? How should I decide when I need to make a new function?
 If I need to visit and insert text into a buffer, should the visit and insert be done at the lowest, i.e. most nested, level possible? Or should I wrap the whole function body in a with-current-buffer?
 If I find myself needing to store a lot of data in variables, am I doing it wrong? I'm not using setq, because it seems like overkill and ugly being global, but even with let and let*, keeping track of what variables have been declared and their scope is getting difficult.
 Should I not declare as many variables and instead make monolithic functions where variable's aren't assigned, rather you just evaluate an expression (xyz) inside the expression you would pass the variable to, i.e. (abc (xyz)) instead of (setq var (xyz)) then (abc var)? I feel like this gets hard to read once you have a lot of nested expressions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been messing with this problem for a while now, off and on for months, really, and it's driving me a little bit crazy, so here we are.
 The specific thing I'm trying to do is exit insert mode (modal editing, previously evil, currently trying meow) when I arrive back in the main org mode file after editing a src block. I'm not actually sure why I end up in insert mode sometimes when exiting src edit, but it happens often. Advising `org-edit-src-exit` is the place to be for this as far as I can tell, and that works when returning to the main org file.
 The problem I have is that editing a src block without calling `org-edit-special`, thus staying in the main org file, will also trigger the advice. Pressing RET, or using anything that makes a new line in the src block (like `meow-insert-above/below`) will call `org-edit-src-exit` and its advice, and I can't find any way to tell in the context of that advice whether the edit is happening in a special edit buffer or not. I'm guessing that editing src blocks without calling `org-edit-special` happens in a background buffer anyway so the process is indistinguishable?
 I've tried checking the major-mode before exiting the edit buffer, but it's always org-mode. I've tried using `org-in-src-block-p`, `org-src-edit-buffer-p`, checking `org-src-mode`, setting a local variable after `org-edit-special` that I can check in my advice, so many things that haven't worked.
 It's very possible that I'm missing something obvious, or there's a very different solution to my specific problem, but even if so, I'm still curious about how to distinguish these src block editing situations. Anybody have any ideas?

 I am doing sorting related exercises on CSES and getting stuck at this problem, https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1619/ 
 Here is my code so far
 ``` import Data.List (sort) import Data.Set qualified as S import Data.ByteString.Char8 qualified as B import Data.ByteString (ByteString) import Debug.Trace
 readPair :: ByteString -> (Int, Int) readPair s = let Just (a, s1) = B.readInt s Just (b, _) = B.readInt $ B.tail s1 in (a, b)
 main :: IO () main = do _ <- B.getLine xs <- pure . sort . map readPair . B.lines =<< B.getContents print $ solve xs
 solve :: [(Int, Int)] -> Int solve xs = fst $ foldl step (0, S.empty) xs where step (m, bs) (a', b') = case S.lookupGT a' bs of Nothing -> (max m 1, S.singleton b') Just gt -> let i = S.findIndex gt bs (_, gts) = S.splitAt i bs in (max m (S.size gts + 1), S.insert b' gts) ```
 Without sorting after map readPair, this code takes 0.1s to run the largest test case and passes the time constraint of 1s. With sorting present, it cannot satisfy the time constraint. I tried using Seq instead of List, but the running time was even worst.
 Please help. Thanks.

I went to a line and hit enter and was prompted to put in a comment and to see the menu with `r` when I was done. I made my comment, saved it with `C-c C-c` and then hit `r` and it says to do `c` for comment. But when I hit that I get 
 `Errors: "Unprocessable Entity. User can only have one pending review per pull request"`
 ​
 I'm not entirely sure how to interpret this. There was also an option to send a comment immediately but that seems to be a comment on the PR as a whole which isn't what I want. 
 I guess what I am asking if for people who use this package to give an overview of their workflow on how they might comment on a section of code and any other pointers that they have.

 It lets me select a file from my org directory using fuzzy find, it lets me enter a name (or select from a list of aliases) and another function adds the selection of a specific item as link target.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm bad at merging and I'd love to change this.
 For context, I can't wrap my head around "theirs" and "ours" in merge conflict resolution tools. Especially since I'm often the solo dev and responsible for both! Since I vaguely remember all the code, I can't even go by "this looks foreign to me" as a heuristic to orient myself. I sometimes lose track when I rebase feature branches with 20 commits onto another branch a couple of files and commits down the road. It's horrible.
 I usually can't make sense of M-x diff output. I often use smerge and 3-way diffing in git projects, that helps a bit to see things in context, but not always.
 For my stupid brain, this is an accessibility problem
 Here's the solution I have in mind: to tweak how diff tools show both sides so that the versions have more meaningful names.
 Exmaples:
  
Merging foo into main, it'd be nice if the label reads "changes to be applied from foo" and "base from main".
 Rabasing banana onto divergent recipes, with the shared ancestor main, it'd be great if it reads "changes from banana" and "commonality from main" and "difference from main in recipes".
  
If you know a diff viewer, conflict resolution tool, whatever that allows this and how one might approach this, pointers would be appreciated! I can Elisp away myself a bit, but don't know where to start.

 I have some dependencies embedded in them like:
 //> using dep com.lihaoyi::os-lib:0.9.3 //> using dep com.lihaoyi::requests:0.8.0 
 and I'd like to have code completion for these libraries.
 I've tried:
  
IntelliJ IDEA + Scala plugin, it doesn't recognize dependencies. I've created imported in a separate module for the directory that contains my scripts, by using BSP, as it recommends the scala-cli documentation. It works fine for regular SBT projects.
 VisualStudio.code + Metals, code completion doesn't work. I don't have much experiencie with this tool.
  
In addition, with scala-cli, it is easy to experiment with newest Scala versions, before I migrate my SBT project from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3.
 IDEA doesn't realize that my scala script is using Scala 3.3.1 instead of 2.13.
 Which tools do you use for nice editing of scripts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I'm trying to do something in Scala and looking for an advice on why it might be a bad idea or on how to do it better.
 I have a CRUD application with several independent modules, where each one is responsible for one or more resources. Resources are classes such as "Task" or "User" with a specific given and modules are well... just traits:
 ``` trait Module[Name <: String]: def description: String = ???
 trait Resource[M, A]: def description: String = ???
 given Module["todo_list"] = new Module["todo_list"] {} given Resource["todo_list", Task] = Resource.register["todo_list", Task] // checks that "todo_list" is a known module ```
 Using this approach I can write generic functions such as:
  // Check that both module and resource are available to the User canRead[R: Resource](resource: R, by: User): IO[Boolean] 
 ...which is cool. But now I want to find out in runtime what resources are registered for a particular module:
  Module["todo_list"].resources.map(_.description) // a set of descriptions 
 How do I do that? I see two approaches:
  
Having a mutable ListBuffer inside the Module trait and just append instances when Resource.register is called - simple, but mutable
 Attaching every resource explicitly somewhere - logs of boilerplate
  
Could there be a better way?

 This will work but it's sad that foo, bar have to be var, not val.
 My workaround is like this:
 ``` class Clazz { lazy (foo, bar) = initFooBar()
 def init() = { foo bar ... }
 def initFooBar() = { foo = ... bar = ... (foo, bar) } } ```
 But this is awkward. Any better way in scala 2? Or is there any library to leverage?

 Is there a best practice of how to do this? Is it just making use of switch-to-buffer and switching back, once done with editing said buffer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I'm creating a master document for a course I'm helping to design as the "source of truth" for all subsequent documents (e.g. anki cards, homework assignments, etc.) I would like to be able to compile certain sections to separate files (e.g. the homework separate from the keys, separate from the anki-decks, etc) without putting everything in different files.
 Does anyone know of a way to do this or something similar? I think I could so something similar-ish by using org-transclusion, but it seems to go in the opposite direction (namely, that the separate documents are included into the big org file, but I would still need to edit them and export them from separate files).
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for reading and for any tips in advance!

For some reason, ligatures that work perfectly on Linux (e.g. true, false) are not working on MacOS, although some do work. I'll post an example screenshot; in Linux all of them work, but as you can see some are not visible in this MacOS screenshot. Anyone seen something like this before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I just started out with Emacs because I wanted to use SLIME for Lisp, but I quickly realized how helpful it can be even without knowing most commands and keybindings.
 The fact that I can have something like a web browser integrated in Emacs is extremely helpful for my ADHD because I can just fire up Emacs in the tty, edit my code in one window and have online docs in the other window, and jump between them and copy stuff from the browser to my code, all in a single workflow, and without anything like YouTube distracting me or getting lost in tabs or desktop.
 While with other editors/environments I have to context-switch between at least 3 different workflows (editor, WM/tmux, browser, and usually other stuff like terminals), carefully configure them to not clash, and implement all sorts of nasty hacks to move data between them. And of course getting my thought process cut short is inevitable.
 Emacs makes it so much easier to stay focused on my project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context, I use Gnus for IMAP email (Fastmail). I like it enough, but figured I could give Rmail a try - you know, the endless itch to try things. In my case I am leaning on built-ins and if possibly smaller packages. Which Gnus is not. And Rmail is the "primary email reader". 
 I got the impression this setup could be less straightforward than the "it just works" approach of Gnus, but still. I installed movemail, made a backup copy with offlineimap in case I deleted all my messages by accident :) and then
 (setq rmail-primary-inbox-list '("imaps://my-user%40fastmail.com:the-password@imap.fastmail.com:993")) 
 It worked! Nice!. Except that I have a bunch of aliases (bills@mydomain.com, subscriptions@mydomain.com, etc.) and rules to redirect the messages to sub-directories of Inbox and I don't see a way to get those with movemail.
 I am guessing the config would be one mail file for each one of those directories? But still can't find how to set that up. 
 I might try pointing Rmail to the Maildir back up too, but just like IMAP, it is a one way conversion so I figured I would ask in case I destroy that synced copy for nothing :) 
 Thank you!
 PS: I would try Maildir as describe here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Mailbox-Formats.html

 ​
 but i'm in college so i have to ask,
 will it be helpful if i spent hours learning emacs?
 i used emacs for three days and couldn't change the tab spaces from 8 to 4
 i don't know how elisp works neither do i know what lisp is.
 are there themes in emacs that we can choose from because doom emacs looked really pale when i installed it
 is Emacs future proof?
 currently only highly elite people use emacs, and if we look at statistics the vim users are dominating the number of people using emacs, will emacs have good support in future because i will be sticking to my favourite editor for my entire lifetime i will be bound to it.
 should i learn emacs after my college ends?
 i learnt how to configure and use window managers but i honestly regret using them as my college sem cgpa lowered a lot using it converting to arch linux was a similar choice i love doing both things but they took a lot of time affecting my career if i had time i would absolutely choose learning window managers and using arch linux. will it be the same with emacs??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, comrades!
 I'm currently getting acquainted with Doom Emacs, and I've already experienced the benefits of org roam and local Python development. However, problems start to arise when I try to start developing in Python on a remote host for work. Not only have I not found any eglot configurations specific to working through Tramp, but the installation of pylsp for Python 3.7.3 is also not as smooth as I would like (perhaps it needs to be installed not in the user directory, but in the venv of the project).
 If anyone has any insights, guides, or experience working under these conditions, I am completely open to suggestions. Maybe I am completely wrong when I try to set all this up through Tramp and ssh-deploy, or the installation of a remote instance on the host will work much better.
 Please, help me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I've been using org-modern for ages now and I just took it out as it really has some weird issues with certain things (like with tables). So I'm back to straight up org-mode with org-superstar, as well as hiding markdown stuff. That all works great! But, I'm wondering:
 Is there a way to hide #+, < > and [ ]? Specifically:
 Turn #+filename: into filename: at the top and <2024-07-02> or [2024-07-02] into just 2024-07-02? I find them kinda ugly to look at in really nicely presented documents/files.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am setting up a blog (what kind of computer scientist would I be without one!) and I am opting to write it in markdown. I have a shell script that converts these into HTML files using Pandoc (because what kind of Haskell enthusiast would I be if I didn't use Pandoc!).
 I am using the Haskell library to make filters for my Pandoc, and I see I can use multiple instances of --filter but I would rather not and just have my one filter do everything I need. Lets say I wanted to do something to any Inline Str instance that starts with a @ and I also want to act on any Block Codeblock instance that is a $haskell type: ```haskell module Main where
 import qualified Data.Text as T import Text.Pandoc.JSON
 main :: IO () main = do -- toJSONFilter dollarHaskellBlock toJSONFilter linkToBlog return ()
 -- | Lets me act specially on codeblocks labeled '$haskell' dollarHaskellBlock :: Block -> Block dollarHaskellBlock (CodeBlock (identifier, cls:clss, keyValue) codeText) | cls == T.pack "$haskell" = CodeBlock (identifier, T.pack "haskell":clss, keyValue) newCodeText where newCodeText = codeText -- do something here dollarHaskellBlock x = x
 -- | adds a link to any blog with a word in the form @word linkToBlog :: Inline -> Inline linkToBlog (Str strText) | head strString == '@' = linkTo where strString = T.unpack strText linkTo = Link ( T.empty , [] , [] ) [ Underline [ Str (T.tail strText) ] ] ( T.pack ("./" ++ (tail . T.unpack . T.toLower) strText ++ ".html") , T.empty ) linkToBlog x = x ```
 In this case I can use one or the other here and the executable will act as a filter, but I feel like I should be able to do one after the other, but just running both in the do block fails :(.
 Is there a solution here? Thanks. 
 P.S. If you don't know what I am talking about here, IT IS GREAT, and you should totally check out Pandoc and Pandoc FIlters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm curious to get the opinion of the Emacs community on this issue, as basically all of my side projects revolve around Emacs package development.
 Background: I am looking to get away from GitHub for development. I would like something a little more in line with FOSS/Libre ideals.
 I've been on SourceHut for a while and I really like that there is 0 Javascript—it's fast, reliable, and has worked well so far. Trouble is, collaboration is a little trickier as it's all via mailing lists right now. I've appreciated learning about mailing lists and I have had some people collaborate with me on some software via email—so cool!—but I know this is a blocker for some people. Also, it's technically still in alpha; I know Prot recently left SourceHut due to some missing features, and I kind of look up to Prot's deliberate approach to all things development.
 An alternative I'm considering is Forgejo. (The Codeberg instance, specifically.) They seem to have similar goals in regards to free software and portability, but the workflow is much more PR-based, which is much more comfortable for many users.
 I'm curious to hear people's opinions on the two forges: where do you like developing software? (Especially Emacs related software.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks!
 I was wondering if anyone knows the current state of macro annotations in Scala 3 LTS:
 It all started a long time ago; I was intrigued by the new style of defining newtypes that libraries like Iron introduced in place of the typical @newtype annotation of the popular Scala 2 library, then I asked "why so much more boilerplate to create a value class?".
 Then I saw that more metaprogramming and macro-based libraries stopped using annotations in Scala 3 as well, and wondered if maybe it was just a change in style in general.
 So my question is, is it no longer possible to create macro annotations? If so, what is the reason for this? Compile time annotations like @tailrec or @depreciation still work, and I also saw that a MacroAnnotation class was introduced under an experimental flag in Scala 3.3.0, but I'm not sure what is left to accomplish so that it could be merged into the latest Scala version.
 I appreciate any clarification on this topic! Happy coding 😄.

I'd like an easy way to configure "default file content" for new files in a per-project way, maybe through .dir-locals.el. I use skeleton-mode for my own projects, but setting that up requires using its mini-language, so not easy to do with dir-locals. Is there a package I could use for this? Perhaps some way to use yasnippets?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When opening a binary file, I want to show the metadata obtained from some shell commands, instead of the real content of that file. For example, I want to do emacs binary.h5, but instead of showing the binary code, I want to show the result from h5ls binary.h5. 
 Of course I can use some hook to run the function I like, but the problem is that emacs would load the content of the file at some point, and I want to avoid this, because the size of the binary file can be huge.
 I think one way to solve this problem is to define my own functions in shell/emacs, and only use those functions to open the file. But I'm curious if there is a way to avoid emacs to load certain files. 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to use the standard font-lock highlighting to get things working how I expect. I'm sure these questions get asked a lot, but I can not get it working as I expect. As you can see in the image below there is very little being highlighted, especially inside js objects:

 From what I've read, having (global-fontlock-mode t) and (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t) set should be enough, and it's described as over the top, yet very little is being highlighted. I did try tree-sitter, but then everything is highlighted to a ridiculous degree and even with the package tree-sitter-langs installed non eof the -ts modes find a configuration. I've read that font-lock mode is good enough, so I'm wondering what I'm missing to get more highlighting?
 Thanks for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I've been using Emacs for a couple months now as my primary editor and a little longer before for just Lisp-related stuff. I have my config (~500 LOC) I'm pretty comfortable with but it's far from perfect. It's a little messy, not everything works as expected. Like I still don't know how to set custom font for Emacs client or solaire mode doesn't work for some reason despite using themes that support it, not a big deal but it'd be nice to make them work. Now I'm thinking whether is it better to polish my current config so I have everything set up exactly how I want or to use some distribution that makes it all easier. I know it's pretty much matter of preferences, but it's hard to make a decision by myself not knowing what I miss from Doom/Spacemacs nor what trade-offs there are + I already have somehow functional config and I don't know if at this point making a switch is a right move.
 And, despite I'm ex hardcore Vim user I don't use evil-mode in Emacs (I mostly do program in Lisp languages in which Vim keybinding is just useless thanks to structural editing and paredit), but I know both of these distribution use evil-mode by default. So what is their support for Emacs keybinding?

 edit : it's been brought to my attention the title is confusing, bringing to mind AWS S3 -- sorry about that. decided not to delete and repost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would much prefer to have my LaTeX in org mode src blocks but then preview doesn't work. Whats the reasoning for this? If I just embed the LaTeX with no begin/end then I can't edit it using org-edit-special : if I do put it in a begin_export or begin_src I can edit it as LaTex but I can't preview it. Am I missing something? Is there a way to preview inside block delimiters that I am missing? Very new to LaTeX inside org so probably overlooked something.
