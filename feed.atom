 If you are using evil mode (vim keybindings) key combination v i W will select the entire word and those surrounding characters. It would be nice to find some way to avoid this.

 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32423127/how-to-view-the-next-days-in-org-modes-agenda
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/12517/how-do-i-make-the-timespan-shown-by-org-agenda-start-yesterday
 But this question is about "scrolling" aka "moving agenda view up or down" by adding previous or subsequent days to the view.
 You can change org-agenda-start-day variable, but I'm not sure how to "regenerate" the view then? There also doesn't seem to be an equivalent "org-agenda-end-day"? Perhaps someone knows a better way to approach this?
 SOLUTION: If you are using doom emacs you can "scroll" by showing previous/next "period" with square brackets ([ previous and ] next). Commands are called org-agenda-earlier and org-agenda-later (a bit hard to find).
 If someone still knew how to "scroll" by adding/removing earlier/later days in the current view that would be still very useful.

 Is there a command to write all committed changes to the corresponding files?
 This question was addressed already on emacs stackexchange: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/477/how-do-i-automatically-save-org-mode-buffers
 The command is org-save-all-org-buffers and is bound by default to C-x C-s
 However what if you have some other org buffers opened that you didn't mean to save when editing org-agenda items at the same time?
 Maybe there is something like org-save-all-org-agenda-buffer to only save the buffers edited in org-agenda?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've repeatedly seen the claim that frequent breaking changes to the language are one reason why Scala isn't more widely adopted in the industry. While I can only speak from my personal experience I don't really see the point here. It seems to me that other languages and ecosystems get away with big changes:
  
Python's adoption has only increased after the infamous 2 -> 3 version change.
 JavaScript itself is backwards-compatible with older versions, but the JS ecosystem keeps changing a lot. For example the industry was happy to adopt React even though it introduces breaking changes with major version updates.
  
What are your takes on this matter? Is feature churn that much higher in Scala? Has language instability been discussed in your organization? Has it impacted any team's decision to use or not use Scala? Will the introduction of LTS versions help Scala's adoption grow in the long-term or will it just make library maintainers happier?

Anyone have experience optimizing their emacs on MacOS as much as possible? I basically run native comp vanilla emacs with only about 100 lines in my init file, which I byte compile (I’m not sure if the init file byte compilation helps? It seems like even though packages get compiled down natively, going into the native code folder (alongside byte compilations) , init.el doesn’t have an option for it).

 All-the-icons maintainer here.
 Over the years, all-the-icons have been inundated by user issues about mis-aligning fonts, tofus and font installation or code point clashing problems. This is all the result of cross-pollination of a set of Web front end tricks of a certain era to Emacs.
 The problems of using icon font are
  
They require extra manual installation of fonts
 Amalgamation of different icon fonts designed for different grids and negative spaces result in non-uniform display of fonts
 Code point clashes
 Updating the fonts and their mappings are painful
 Fonts don't scale properly even with a lot of manual adjustments
 The project gets an incessant amount of issues opened due to all of the above
  
Since last August, I have been experimenting with simply using the SVG sources of these fonts directly instead, and I'm happy to announce that I'm satisfied with the result enough that I want to invite the community to try out the SVG branch.
 There are now over 18000 icons included in the package, and over 31000 when you count all the variations. Chances are, if you are looking for an icon that looks good and appropriate, it's probably in there.
 The public API largely remains the same, but there are some backward incompatible changes in the private APIs. Please refer to the README for details.
 Judging from Github searches, these changes do not appear to cause too much breakage, but I could be wrong. Please let me know on Github as I do not plan to come back to Reddit too often because of a certain u/spez.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm interested in creating forms using org-mode where information entered beneath each heading can be saved to an sqlite database, with each org-mode heading being the column heading for the sql table.
 I am using the emacsql package for saving the information to the database, and so long as the entries are placed in a vector, an emacsql function will be able to save the entries to the sql table.
 With the help of chatgpt, I've found several ways of parsing the org-mode headers and saving the entries within each header to a vector. When I display the vector in emacs, the entries look exactly as I would expect.
 However, when I save them to the database, each entry not only includes the text that I want, but a bunch of elisp code around it that appears to be coding the relative position of the text within the org file. It's as if the text has a bunch of Metadata attached to it that is invisible within emacs but becomes visible when taken out of emacs and put into the database. I've tried many different ways but all end with the same outcome.
 It's clear that there's a problem with the methods im using, so I'm wondering if anyone has been able to successfully do something like this before or has some suggestions as to why this is happening and how to fix it. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 ​
 I'm new to ZIO and currently exploring the concepts of ZIO environment, ZLayers, and ZEnvironment. As I delve into the ZIO documentation and source code, I feel like I'm missing a few pieces to fully grasp how they fit together. I'd greatly appreciate your insights in helping me form a complete picture.
 ​
 In the `ZIO[R, E, A]` effect, the type parameter `R` is referred to as the environment type or the ZIO environment of type `R`. The ZIO environment can be constructed by composing ZLayers. By using accessor methods provided by the ZIO datatype, we can access the ZIO environment of a specific type to execute the effect.
 ​
 Here's where I am seeking clarification: Is it correct to say that ZIO constructs the ZIO environment of the required type `R` from the ZIO environment built by composing the layers? The ZIO environment constructed from the layers will have a different type, but ZIO effects need a specific ZIO environment of a particular type.
 ​
 Furthermore, I am curious about the role of ZEnvironment in all of this. How does it fit into the overall picture?
 ​
 I am grateful for any insights or explanations you can provide to help me better understand these concepts and their interactions.
 ​
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star buffers are sometimes useful but I almost never need them and see them as clutter. Consult makes it really easy to modify and add sources. Here how to put star buffers out of mind but still include them in the buffer list by putting them at the bottom of your buffers list when using consult-buffer. This example removes star buffers from the main buffer source and creates a new source for them.
 (defvar consult--source-star (list :name "*Star-Buffers*" :category 'buffer :narrow ?s :face 'consult-buffer :history 'buffer-name-history :state #'consult--buffer-state :items (lambda () (consult--buffer-query :sort 'visibility :as #'buffer-name :include '("\\*."))))) ;; modify buffer source to exclude star sources (setq consult--source-buffer (plist-put consult--source-buffer :items (lambda () (consult--buffer-query :sort 'visibility :as #'buffer-name :exclude '("\\*."))))) ;; reorder sources and add star source at the end (setq consult-buffer-sources '(consult--source-hidden-buffer consult--source-modified-buffer consult--source-buffer consult--source-bookmark consult--source-recent-file consult--source-file-register consult--source-project-buffer-hidden consult--source-project-recent-file-hidden consult--source-star)) 
 If you truly want to hide them you can use :hidden per the documentation https://github.com/minad/consult#multiple-sources but I find putting them under recent files good enough.

You can do it interactively with (delete-other-windows), but it doesn't seem to work from terminal: (progn (org-capture) (delete-other-windows)) .
 There were a few attempts to do it already in 2013:
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15253005/in-emacs-org-mode-how-do-i-get-org-capture-to-open-in-a-full-sized-window
 in 2015:
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21195327/emacs-force-org-mode-capture-buffer-to-open-in-a-new-window
 and in 2018:
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/46460/org-capture-frame-with-no-splits
 None of which seem to work in 2023 (doom) emacs. Has anyone by any chance recently configured this and would be kind enough to share it? Or are you using org-capture in a completely different way that skips this problem altogether? Or are you using some other package for quick note taking?

But when I use this setup to read the code of NetHack, it doesn't work for linting and definition finding (M-.), even though eglot connection has no problem. I observed the same problems when reading the code of SQLite. Some specific problems I observed:
 for #include "hack.h"
  
clang [pp_file_not_found]: 'hack.h' file not found
  
for boolean known;
  
clang [unknown_typename]: Unknown type name 'boolean'
  
I think the problem may be due to a mismatch of C version between the code and clangd. But how can I tell clangd to check a specific version of C (eg. C99)?
 (Edit) I just tried to use `c-ts-mode`, and for some reason the linting issues went away but I still cannot jump using (M-.).
 (Edit 2) It seems that the problems in SQLite source code went away when I use c-ts-mode.
 (Edit 3) Still have the following problem when I use (M-.) in NetHack code:
  
No definitions found for: LSP identifier at point

Applications such as a-Shell already provide a terminal environment for running WASM binaries. Running Emacs locally on your iPad has many benefits compared to running it on a remote host.
 One of the challenges with cross-compiling Emacs is the dumping. Perhaps a way around that is to just use “temacs”, which avoids the dumping step.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever I take a course, all the relevant material is spread across multiple platforms: Moodle, Microsoft Teams, personal websites, boards from the previous years...
 Every time I start a new course I have to navigate across all these pages and archive everything that I could possibly need: slides, assignments, exams from previous years, etc...
 However, there are a bunch of issues:
  
Storing everything in the file system is a mess: not everything can be stored as a file. Some things (like an online quiz) are meant to be stored as simple bookmarks. This heterogeneity breaks the purpose of "having only one place to look at" for me
 
Given "exam-2-4-2005.pdf", I'd like to write some information related to it: whether i have already done it, and the solution. Sometimes the solution is on paper, so all I need to write is a simple number that corresponds to the page on my paper notebook.
 
 Using org mode, I can link both local files and Http URLs (also pdf pages!). I could also write notes related to each one of them.
 Does any of you have a similar workflow in your Emacs routine? Is there some suggestion or package that could aid me for this purpose? This is the first time I use org for something beyond note taking, so I really do not have any "concrete" idea on how to achieve all this.

 [2023-06-17 14:21:57] And then that other thing...
  
Yas snippet or org-time-stamp commands let you add a timestamp anywhere in the document, but it may get tedious with larger lists. Ideally there would be some way for a timestamp to be bound to the new item creation? Would you just add a yasnippet to a new keybinding (for example Ctrl+Shift+RET)? If anyone has such an example in their config I would really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I tried to use Eglot + pyright on Django project.
 But pyright doesn't works as expected, can not get completion on when import django.db.model
 Any one known how to make pyright works with Django?
 Steps to reproduce:
 ​
  
setup project
  
​
 mkdir django-project cd django-project python3 -m venv ./.venv .venv/bin/python3 -m pip install django source .venv/bin/activate django-admin startproject CoreRoot . django-admin startapp core python manage.py migrate python manage.py runserver 
  
Install Pyright
  
sudo npm install -g pyright
  
Install pyvenv for activate virtual environment in Emacs
 (use-package pyvenv :hook (python-mode . pyvenv-mode) :config (setq pyvenv-post-activate-hooks (list (lambda () (setq python-shell-interpreter (concat pyvenv-virtual-env (if (eq system-type 'windows-nt) "scripts/python" "bin/python")))))))
 
Start Emacs and open the file: django-project/core/models.py
 
M-x pyvenv-activate and choose the .venv directory
 
M-x eglot, and choose pyright-langserver
 
Try some example code in django-project/core/models.py as below:
 from django.db import models
 class Person(models.Model): first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30) last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
 
You find that you can't get completion for "CharField", see pictures as below:
 
 ​
 can get models
 ​
 Can not get CharField
 ​
 9 . I also tried python-language-server(pylsp), it can get completion but the server is a little slow, I can feel delay while input characters.
 ​
 works as expected with pylsp
 You can test with this example project: https://github.com/Eason0210/django-project.git
 My personal Emacs config: https://github.com/Eason0210/.emacs.d
 my Emacs version:
 GNU Emacs 30.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-apple-darwin22.5.0, NS appkit-2299.60 Version 13.4 (Build 22F66), git sha1 8657afac774) of 2023-06-16

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ChatGPT and I collaborated on a Visual Studio Code extension to display a list of markdown files by their H1 header. The extension is called Zettel View, and it contributes a Zettlr-like display of Zettels to the VS Code Explorer View, as shown below.

Clicking on any file in the Zettel View window opens the Zettel markdown file in an editor window and causes the file explorer to highlight the selected file.  Since I installed the "Auto-Open Markdown Preview" VS Code extension, the markdown preview of the selected Zettel also appears.
The Zettel View extension for VS Code is available on my GitHub account.
Zettel View makes some assumptions about Zettels. First, Zettels are markdown files with the extension .md. Second, a markdown file's H1 or level-one header has the form # ID TITLE (the ID is to the left; some prefer the ID on the right). Third, ID matches a regular expression specific to my ID scheme. Fourth, ID.md is the filename of the Zettel markdown file with the header # ID TITLE.
The second and third assumptions are hard-coded but could be made configurable in later versions of the extension. The fourth assumption isn't enforced: a mismatch between ID.md and the filename will appear as a discrepancy between the Zettel selected in the Zettel View and the file explorer. A warning will be emitted in that case.
Zettr has the built-in configuration setting, "Display files using first heading level 1 if available." A community plugin for Obsidian called "File Explorer Markdown Titles" once produced a similar display in the Obsidian file explorer. Unfortunately, that plugin no longer works with newer versions of Obsidian. Since VS Code is more valuable for my work than Obsidian, it made more sense to develop a VS Code extension than to modify the plugin to work with the current Obsidian API. I plan to move to VS Code the Pandoc and LaTeX integration I configured in Zettlr.]]></summary>

Nothing I have tried seems to get rid of either the arrows or the gray blocks. Is there some function that shuts this off as it's visually really distracting? Thx in advance... 
 P.S. The white arrows might be difficult to see under the gray block but they are there sure enough!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I have been doing some programming in python. I have got it working nicely in Emacs - I may share my configuration another time.
 I'm have a problem with imports though. In Python you bring in a library by "importing" it. I often have to edit libraries that are part of the project I'm working on. The problem is that in Python 3 you can't unload a library, nor can you replace it with a newer version.
 This is a problem because Emacs python-mode is based around the idea of sending python code to a python shell. This works fine unless imports get involved. Once imports get involved you run into the problem that python will never re-import a library after it has imported it once. So, if you're editing a library the only way to update to the new version (which could be what you just wrote) is to stop the python process and start another one.
 Is there a fix for this? Has anyone written a package to at least make constantly restarting python more convenient?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently using C++ in Emacs with lsp-mode. I use CMake to generate compile_commands.json with set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON).
 So far, this has been working great -- until I had to write template implementation files:
 Refresher: 
  
In non-templated C++, #include "header.hpp" goes at start of implementation.cpp file.
 
In templated C++, #include "implementation.tpp" goes at end of header.hpp file. 
 
 Basically, since implementation.tpp doesn't explicitly "include" its header definitions, the LSP thinks I am just writing out things without defining them, resulting in a bunch of squiggly lines.
 I know a lot of people just put their template implementation code in the header file, but I really want to keep it separate. Have any C++ users encountered this problem before and found a solution? Thanks.

 * TODO Task 1 * TODO Task 2 * TODO Task 3 
 After some time you complete these tasks and want to add new ones. Where do you add them? Do you add them to the same file? Do you create a new file after the first one gets too big? Do you manually perform clean up of the file every so often?
 It may be unrelated, but I'm wondering how do you add new entries? I imagine that if file gets really big opening and navigating it may get slow after some time. Do you have custom capture templates for that? Do you manually open that file navigate to the top or bottom and add entries there?
 There seems to be a lot of manual processes involved here, which I assume people have figured out how to automate already, but I can't quite find out where.
 In org agenda calendar view there is some mention of a "diary file" - is that the place where these entries should be stored instead of organizing them manually?

 in this blog post I wrote back in 2018, I had described how to set up a function for org-mode in EMACS, that allows you to take screenshots and include them in your org-file with just one move. An example application looks like this: GIF
 There is now a new version of the function with improved interface and functionality, you can find it in the post above, or directly in the gitlab repo. The corresponding snippet can be found here.
 Hope it helps, I'm looking forward to any kind of feedback.

 I hope you're all having a great day. I'm a newbie to Emacs, and I've been doing some exploring to find the best fit for me. I started with Spacemacs, but to be honest, it felt overwhelming, and I couldn't get all its spirit.
 Then, I gave Doom Emacs a shot, and I was simpler, yet it still seems to have all the functionality I need. For me, doom-emacs offers me a great experience, though. 
 That said, I have a minor concern. I noticed they released the last significant update back in March. More concerning, though, is that there seem to be quite a few unanswered pull requests, some of which appear to be pretty important in terms of features or fixes.
 So, in my complete ignorance, I first want to ask you guys experts about the situation. 
 Is Doom Emacs still being actively maintained? If not, what do you think is the best way, return to Spacemacs or try another configuration kit? 
 Thanks for your insights and suggestions. 
 Best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys! I want to export a certain company/project TODO list I am working on, to a CSV file, in order to produce a shareable ongoing progress report of my work onlne. I've gotten the Emacs built in macro org-batch-agenda-csv working somewhat using a command like this:
 (org-batch-agenda-csv "MYTAG1|MYTAG2")
 Where I'm struggling is with date/time information. I assumed that if my TODOs have a typical SCHEDULED attribute that i'd easily discover date/time info in the generated csv. So far, no such luck.
 The help for org-batch-agenda-csv macro talks about optional (rest) Parameters that "are alternating variable names and values that will be bound before running the agenda command." This sounds extremely useful but I'm not sure how to proceed without perhaps examples of how these could be used for some typical uses.
 There are also a handful of references to date/time things in both the Emacs online help for the macro, and in the elisp macro definition. I am not an Emacs Lisp expert though and so far my randomish trial and error has gone nowhere.
 Can you help?
 Thanks!

 So,
 I'm writing an application using vanilla js + WebGL and my development stack is:
  
emacs
 lsp-mode
 company-mode
 ts-ls installed through emacs
  
My LSP config is here, and I'm open to suggestions for improving it.
 Completion works fine for the core parts of javascript, e.g. getElementByID() and friends. But if I want to call into, let's say, the canvas API, I don't have completion working. Here's an example:
 var canvas = document.getElementById("foo"); var ctx = canvas.getContext("bar"); 
 screenshot
 Note how the getContext isn't offered by the language server as a completion option.
 Here's a second example:
 xmlr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xmlr.open('GET', url, false); 
 Similarly, the open isn't offered as a completion option.
 How do I fix this? I've tried setting both a tsconfig.json and a jsconfig.json with the following contents:
 { "compilerOptions": { "target": "es2020", "lib": ["es2020"], "module": "commonjs" } } 
 But no dice. I still don't get completion in the examples above.
 What do?

 I am setting a variable depending on the hostname and have this in my init.el:
 ;; here is code that sets mh/org-dir (setq org-agenda-files mh/org_dir) (cd mh/org_dir) 
 the cd works but when I try to open the agenda I get "org-agenda-files cannot be a single directory".
 My question now: If you have the name of a directory in a variable: how do you add all the org-files in that directory to the agenda?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I finally found a few hours to implement 2 features from swiper that I missed in consult-line:
 ​
  
Smart recenter: buffer is recentered only if you jump to match outside of current view. (This can be done in a pretty non-invasive way via hooks)
 Highlighting of matches on all visible lines in buffer. This is a noticeable patch to core consult code. Instead of creating a patch/fork, I just put into a separate file which I load after consult itself, it redefines quite a few core functions. It might break with newer consult versions.
  
​
 Feel free to try: https://gist.github.com/lazy/4f609cf2b956de2531885747e3c3bf88
 Save it to "consult-patch.el" file, open in emacs, M-x eval-buffer, run consult-line, search for something like "let" and enjoy.
 ​
 UPD: gist was updated at least once. Overlay caching didn't move overlays between windows. Now it doef.
 ​
 P.S. I saw another approach to doing that: https://github.com/minad/consult/pull/774. But minad decided not to merge it due to perf and personal preference. Mine is a little better performance-wise: it checks for highlighting only visible candidates and caches the highlight overlays (of which there can be many). But I am not sure if I will be able to overcome minad's personal preference, so don't want to bother with PR. If someone wants to polish this code and try merge into mainline, I won't mind. Think of this code as "public domain".
 P.P.S. I don't use swiper because I have quite a lot of custom vertico/vertico-posframe/consult configuration which I do not want to replicate for swiper.

 And I have an option at the header:

 - What is likely the issue with this case?

I'm curious if Scala can offer suitable implementations, based on its language features, to make the development of asynchronous streaming text applications easier, just like popular older Scala projects in the field of big data.
 AI and LLM have made Python great again; perhaps Scala can demonstrate its power in new domains.
 P.S. I'm currently working on a closed-source Java-lang project for our LLM project, built on Reactor. Just asking for fun.

 It's, well, a calculator for your Android phone.
 It's got all the usual buttons with numbers and operators, and also parentheses as well as buttons for storing the partial results of your calculations to the memory.
 But that's not all. It also has an advanced editor hidden under the "Fx" button. In that mode, you can write an expression with your virtual keyboard, as if you were writing simple programming code. You can use variables and functions from a list, combine them, and even write your own custom ones. They will be stored on the phone so they can be actually useful to you more than once.
 And, on top of that, FxCalculator was written in Scala 3, with JavaFX, Gluon, and GraalVM Native Image. For now it's available only as APK stored on GitHub. You can install it by allowing 3rd party APK installation on your Android, clicking the link above on your phone, and then downloading and installing the APK from there.
 I will try to push the app to the Google store and create a better looking webpage for it later this year.

 I gave a quick run around the posts about emacs server/daemon and I have a couple of questions
  
If you don't put any special arguments by default and you run emacs --daemon this will have a Unix socket right? Which means that both server and client will be on localhost.
 You can also specify a TCP socket allowing the server and the client to live on separate hosts. Is this right?
 Finally, if and when this happens when you edit files with emacsclient do you edit files on the client side or on the server side? Would this be a good use for editing files both on the server and the client? Or you should have something separate to edit files on the server? i.e. use git or ssh or nextcloud
  
Thank you very much for your help.

 Over the past month or so, images in tweets shown in nitter have stopped displaying in EWW, but can be seen on an external browser like Firefox. 
 For instance, in this tweet, there is a profile picture and an embedded .jpg image of a football/soccer player which both show up in Firefox. However, when viewed in EWW only the poster's profile picture is shown. This is not the case for images that show up as "previews" of webpages, e.g. in this tweet, both the profile picture and the previewed image of aircraft from the article both show up in EWW.
 I thought this issue would explain why, but the images I see in Firefox are .jpg, not webp. This might still be a nitter issue, but I would be interested to understand why this has happened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a follow-up to this old thread, I am pleased to announce the first release of the Kreuzberg Library.
 The library's primary purpose is to simplify the creation of declarative ScalaJS components.
 The concept is straightforward:
  
Components can subscribe to models, which contain some state.
 Components declare event bindings (e.g., click events) that, in turn, modify models.
 If a model changes, the components emit new HTML (including event bindings and sub-components).
 The new HTML gets rendered.
  
Additionally, Channels are included, which offer n:m communication and can be incorporated into event bindings (as sources and sinks).
 HTML rendering can be performed via Scalatags and Scala XML, but other mechanisms can also be implemented.
 The rendering engine can be changed. Currently, there are two simple client-side engines available: a simple imperative, and a ZIO-Based.
 A proof-of-concept RPC system is also available. You can declare a trait for a service, and macros will generate a stub for the client (ScalaJS) app and dispatcher code for the server side. In the examples, this is used to implement a TODO app with server-side storage.
 Components, Models, and Channels are identified by IDs, which are currently auto-incremented. This isn't entirely functional. I've experimented with other ideas, like creating IDs via a State-Monad, but they ended up being less practical.
 I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

 I've tried cycling visibility to show level one headers only and doing a visual selection of line Foo2 and Foo3 then using regexp-replace and :s/... but in both cases the replacement takes place on the folded lines under Foo2 and Foo3 too.
 * Foo1 ** Sub * Foo2 ** Sub * Foo3 ** Sub * Foo4 ** Sub 
 UPDATE Setting search-invisible to nil prior to the replacement, works as long as 1) I use regexp-replace, and 2) the search is for plain text (not a regexp) only. 
 If I search for $ then neither regexp-replace nor :substitute work.
 UPDATE 2 Oopsie, I predominantly use spacemacs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am starting a process via start-process-shell-command. The command starts server, and is actually never "finished" as the server is continuously running. However, one can infer when this command is finished, that is to say when the server is up and running, by looking at the output (i.e. when the string "Server is running!" is observed in the output).
 I want to code up an Elisp function that calls the command, wait until the server is up and running, and only then execute the next step. How would I best do this?
 My current method is check the relevant process-buffer every 0.5 sec (with sleep-for) to see if the known regex pattern is observed, however this seems a bit sub-optimal. In particular I am unable to use Emacs until the pattern is observed (even though my process is async).
 I have tried to read up on process filters as my understanding is that they are functions which receive output from processes, but I can't figure out a way to "wait" until the regex pattern is observed via filters.
 Does anyone have any idea how to reliably achieve this, or any pointers on where I should look to understand process filters better to get to my solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven’t really used emacs too much yet, but I love the idea of using it for taking notes and organizing my life with org mode. Funny enough, I feel like I’m procrastinating organizing my life cause I’m thinking “wait I need to get org mode set up first”.
 The problem is, I’ve seen people say it takes YEARS to understand emacs and that it has an incredibly high learning curve. I wouldn’t mind using something like doom or centaur, but at the same time, it seems weird to use a preconfigured editor and not understand what’s going on underneath the hood, especially if there’s an issue and I don’t know how to fix it. You think that’s a big deal or is using those preset editors perfectly fine? I’m looking to use vim bindings so I wonder if I should just stay with doom.
 I’m planning on reading “Mastering Emacs”, working through the built in tutorial, the elisp tutorial (maybe, but it seems weird to not understand the language the entire applications is built and configured in), and maybe Emacs from Scratch and the org mode udemy tutorial by Rainer Konig.
 After all that maybe I’ll know enough to build my own config, or at least understand a lot of what goes on in doom or centaur or something.

with the concept of property-based testing, and have first hand
experience with a framework like QuickCheck or hedgehog. You might

just like what we’ve already been doing for so long, right? Just
generate a bunch of random test inputs, in the hope of exposing an
unknown bug?
Well, actually there’s more to it than that! Recently, I had some fun
exploring coverage-guided fuzzers like AFL++ and libFuzzer. Along
the way, I discovered a simple trick that allows us to compile Haskell
code in a manner that these fuzzers can handle. The experience was
akin to unlocking a hidden skill. I can say, without a doubt, that

 When I open some.cfg in emacs, conf-mode is selected. But if I do M-x sh-mode after that, the sh-mode settings from .dir-locals.el are applied (the sh-basic-offset and fill-column).
 Why it ignores the auto-mode-alist clause? My emacs is from ubuntu 22.04 repositories, version 27.1+1-3ubuntu5.
 Yes, I tried starting it with the -q option, the behavior is the same.

 I use org with neovim, instead of Emacs. So the package khalel was not useful for me.

 treesitter-inspect-mode tells me that I'd need to highlight nodes matching a query like jsx_opening_element "<", jsx_opening_element ">", etc. I saw the recent Mastering Emacs article on Treesitter which was very helpful in getting started, but it wasn't clear to me how to customize fine details like this.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a custom quicksort method and I need it to be able to sort a sequence of any type, as long as the type has a "<" operator (it is comparable). I would have thought this is something done commonly but I'm having issues. At first I made the method like so:
 partitionInPlace[A <: Ordered[A]] (...
 But it turns out common AnyVal types such as Int and Double don't extend Ordered, so that's not suitable. They extend Ordering but that's not quite the same and it seems silly to use a function such as "gteq" instead of a simple operator.
 I have a feeling the solution is some kind of implicit conversion? Please help, I'm kind of new to Scala and I'm sure this is a common issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I've been programming in Java but wanted to try something new from the ecosystem and chose Scala. However, I've encountered a major problem. Sbt starts syncing my projects but never finishes. I even let it run for entire day and nothing happened.
 I've tried basic troubleshooting: reinstalling IntelliJ Idea (2023.1.2), running different versions of sbt ( 1.9.2, 1.8.3, 1.8.2, 1.7.3 ), reinstalling Scala (2.13.19 and 2.13.17), disabling Windows Defender, installing different JDKs (19, 17, 11, 1.8), removing .lock, file, checking logs - they are empty. I even upgraded from Windows 10 to Windows 11.
 I know that Scala works better on Linux, but I tested a similar scenario on my friend's Windows 10 laptop and it worked like a charm. 
 Here's screenshot of my last attempt:
 https://preview.redd.it/28f2b7ajou5b1.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ef0f584998bae20641a352c08ee6307dcc70a3
 Honestly, i have no idea what else I can do. I've read through many GitHub issues for sbt and nothing has helped. Has anyone else encountered simillar problem? Any tips or suggestions on what I can do next would be greatly appreciated.

 I've been using Obsidian for notes, it kinda works. But have been thinking about Org mode for a while now for both my personal notes and work notes.
 Generally, I'm assigned to a project/client for a period of time. I have thought about creating an org folder in home then a org/client for the client or project then something like: - meetings.org for meetings and calls - notes.org for client or project specific notes - tickets.org for any sort of ticketing system they use to help keep track of those without having to login to the ticket system.
 TODOs would of course roll up to Org Agenda.
 More general notes would be in the main Org file.
 Any tips or thoughts on how to manage a similar workflow? Open to ideas.
 I would setup some capture templates to make it easier to add data to these. Maybe even org-roam at some point.
 I would have to start small and expand as I go. Just working on thinking through the mental model. I plan to start working on reading the org manual, any other recommended resources would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a working(!) org-capture extension for org-protocol. It's Firefox-only at the moment but I'm happy to accept patches to support Chromium based browsers. I wrote it because none of the current extensions/bookmarklets were all that usable (security popups, no hotkeys, etc.).
 Features include:
  
Hotkeys. One for storing links, one for capturing the page (or selected text, if there's a selected region).
 Context menu items for capturing: 
 A link to the current page, along with a description pulled from the page's metadata.
 Selected text. Optionally, selections can be captured as HTML. You'll want to use this with something like org-protocol-capture-html to translate the HTML to org mode.
 Media (images, video, etc.). Media can be (optionally) downloaded (through your browser's download manager) before capturing.
 
 A browser action button to perform some default action on click (can either store a link to the current page, or initiate a capture).
 Optionally, capturing a selection will capture the HTML itself. You'll want to use this with something like org-protocol-capture-html to translate the HTML to org mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 Does anyone know what are the closest alternatives to functional scala using cats effect or zio?
 Do any other languages (that companies hire for) allow the same effect driven monad\IO FP style? 
 From what I've seen, haskell is the closest alternative, but I was wondering if there are others I'm not aware of.
 I really like the style of developing that scala with cats effect\zio allows, but I think it might be a good idea to look into another language(s) that encourages this style\methodology too, in order to increase the amount of potential companies I can apply to. 
 Many thanks.

 Everything is in the title :) 
  
did you experimen with the feature ? 
 what do you think of it ? 
 any lib using them rn ? or example projet ? I would be extra interested in error handling examples 
  
I've started playing around with boundaries and breaks for the fun of it with the objective of implementing an async/await ( but I guess dotty-cps-async existing and looking great kinda killed my motivation ^^ ) and making scala more Rust-like with Result<E, A> and "nice" ( all a matter of perspective folks, don't burn me to the stakes yet ) overloadings with .? and .! . Very rough right now though
 I'd welcome any suggestion if you have a lookt at mine, and would very much like to see yours !

If your Zk is file-based, uses a UID as part of the file name, like 202306XXX..., and you have Python and dependencies installed; it should work for you.

 Does anybody have some tips to throw ny way perhaps ?
 thx. S
 edit: yes, yes it is possible:
 ``` defaults tls on tls_starttls on logfile ~/.cache/msmtp.log
 account mymail host smtp.office365.com user xxx@xxx from xxx@xxx tls_certcheck on auth xoauth2 passwordeval "oauth2ms -e xxx@xxx" port 587 tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt ```
 turns out, I had the token stored with encryption and forgot to add the -e xxx@xxx argument....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I watched a video where it looked like the youtuber was using XEmacs (it was not the topic of the video, so it wasn't mentioned), so I went to XEmacs site to see if there had been any updates, and it turns out, there was a release around a month ago!
 I had used XEmacs in the early 2000s, before Emacs 21 or 22, don't remember. But one of the things I liked more, was that help buffers and other popup windows, get focused straight away, so they are easier to navigate and to close, just by using the normal movement keys and q. I always thought it was much nicer than the default in GNU Emacs, where the popup window is not focused so you use C-M-v and C-M-V to scroll it and C-x 1 to get rid of the help window.
 After a short period of XEmacs, I brought with me that XEmacs behavior for help buffers to GNU Emacs. I've been doing that for more than 20 years.
 Well, from the XEmacs changelog: 
  
Improve: Help buffer behaviour synced with GNU (Mats Lidell)
  
I laughed so hard :D

 New in this issue:
 - support for boundary/break API, which was introduced in Scala-3.3.0
 - changed API for custom monad contexts -- now monad context should provide an instance of monad with possible intercepted operations instead await interceptor. This is needed for unification with context-encoded direct style, where we can have no await-s. [And last relative significant change, for which we had kept the '0.x' versioning scheme].

 I am wrassling with outlook365 and I want to move from thunderbird to mu4e and I have finally been able to get mbsync to login and download the mails. However, with thunderbird I have set up an Archives/[YEAR] subfolders structure that I have used for years with my personal mail that also works as advertised in mu4e.
 But with outook365 I get :
 IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Archives/2022 (reserved character '/' in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Archives/2023 (reserved character '/' in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Calendar/Birthdays (reserved character '/' in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Calendar/United States holidays (reserved character '/' in name) 
 Which I thought/expected to be flattened into Archives.2022 like in my personal setup.
 This is the relevan mbsynrc snippet: ``` IMAPStore outlook-remote Account xxxxxx PathDelimiter "."
 MaildirStore outlook-local Path ~/Mail/outlook/ #trailing / is important ! Inbox ~/Mail/outlook/INBOX
 Flatten "."
 Subfolders Verbatim
 InfoDelimiter "_"
 Channel outlook Far :outlook-remote: Near :outlook-local: Patterns * INBOX* Create Near Expunge Near SyncState * Sync All ```
 Does anybody have some tips or tricks up their sleeve perhaps ?
 thx S

 As part of my Master thesis, I would like study some of Akka's internals, i.e. the code machinery that allow actors and Behaviors to work.
 I am aware of the Actor Architecture's documentation, but I am looking for something different:
  
What are the most important components that allow an actor to come into existence and communicate with others? How do these components interact?
 When an actor does a tell, what components does the message go through until the receiving side processes it?
  
I examined the source code a bit; my understanding is that the ActorCell class is crucial; however, being an implementation component that is not to be touched by users directly, it is not covered by the user documentation. Similar reasoning for the ActorRefProvider class.
 Up until now I have found this resource (it provides a very useful component diagram); I am looking for similar resources, and possibly more comprehensive ones.
 Any resource would be helpful (even conference talks). Thanks for your inputs.

And also, if you have any suggestions based on my taste above, please recommend me fonts to try out (if possible with the lisp code on your init.el so that its easy for me).
 P.S. I also like the red code font used on reddit here

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I messed with my Emacs config recently and uninstalled some Clojure-related packages (clojure-mode, clojure-mode-extra-font-locking, cider) from a couple of years ago. I decided I wanted to explore Clojure again but now, when I run cider-jack-in, if I type an expression and hit Enter, it just creates newlines repeatedly, but does not evaluate.
 I have tried some troubleshooting steps, but have not had any success. What I've tried so far is:
  
Clear out ~/.emacs.d/elpa and let the packages install fresh.
 Upgrade leiningen (with brew on macOS), start a new Clojure project and core.clj file and try to jack in to that. (Has the same behavior.)
 Enabled logging for nrepl-server. No errors are logged.
  
Interestingly, if I run C-x C-e next to an expression in core.clj, it evaluates normally, but the REPL no longer works.
 Could you please suggest more troubleshooting steps or a possible fix? I am running EmacsforOSX version 28.2. I searched the web but have not yet found someone who encountered this same problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, 
 I found the following in Section 16.10 of the Emacs Lisp Info Manual for Emacs 28.2: 
 "Normally, well-designed Lisp programs should not use with-eval-after-load. If you need to examine and set the variables defined in another library (those meant for outside use), you can do it immediately—there is no need to wait until the library is loaded."
 Some obvious exceptions to setting variables "immediately" spring to mind, such as modifying a library's keymaps with define-key(). The keymaps must already exist, of course, which happens only after the library is loaded. I don't doubt that the manual authors had situations like that in mind with their beginning caveat, "Normally . . ." 
 But more generally: what if the library, upon loading, overwrites -- with its own default values -- the values the user had earlier set? 
 It seems to me that it's safer to put all setq()s and whatnot into with-eval-after-load and be done with it. Or are there benefits to the blunter "don't bother waiting" approach that I'm missing? 
 This comment from the Info Manual is tormenting me: I would sooner die than write an ill-designed Lisp program!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit. More background information here. The recent "Ask Me Anything" session with the CEO of Reddit didn't really address the concerns of people, and some subreddits decided that they would shutdown indefinitely.
 I think /r/haskell as a community should be discussing what action to take. On a personal level, this subreddit is pretty dear to me, as it has been my go-to place to keep up to date with the Haskell news over the years, and has been an invaluable source of information when I first started learning the language. So I guess my (kind of open-ended) question is: what is the stance of /r/haskell regarding the events happening on the broader Reddit? I am aware that a bunch of communities are migrating to some federated, open-source alternatives, most popular being Lemmy. Would us as a community consider such a mass exodus? The admin of functional.cafe, a Mastodon instance for the FP community, has recently been gauging interest in spinning up a Lemmy instance, maybe some arrangement could be made through cooperative effort?
 I have created this thread to hopefully seed some useful discussion surrounding these. I am looking forward to hear what the community thinks in general.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my setup I use a file for each "project" i.e.
  
Tasks - personal tasks
 Work - for work tasks
 Config - for tasks related to updating my config
 Game Design - tabletop game design tasks
 Programming Study - for learning / growing my programming knowledge
  
You get the idea. Each of these have a filetag so that everything is tagged and I have use categories for top level task types i.e. tasks/meetings/reminders etc (this lets me use category icons)
 The issue I have is for negative filtering. Say I want to filter out JUST my work and config tasks for say the weekend when I can work on a variety of personal projects.
 The documentation (here) states:
 C-u / Hide entries matching a tag. You can successively call this command to hide several tags. 
 If I call this and use Work it filters out work options. I call it again and the prompt is pre-filled with the text "-work" if i change it to "config" then work comes back. So I though maybe it should be "-work-config" when i do this it removes config but brings back work. I'm at a complete loss on how to apply multiple negative filters.
 I've also tried using \ for the Tag filter only mode not the more universal / filter. There same thing if I exclude work and run \ again and exclude config it brings work back

 Documentation on the native android port is hard to find; searching tends to give me decades old stack overflow questions and lots of info about termux.
 Are there good docs about configuring the Android port?
 Maybe the ideal at this point would be just to be able to point the native port to the .emacs.d I have already set up in termux, if there's a way to do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently using Debian-stable, known for its reliability. However, packages in the Debian repository tend to become outdated over time. Therefore, I chose to download the Emacs source tarball and compile it myself, which was successful. Recently, I came across the Guix package manager, which can be installed on Debian. Based on my research, guix install emacs installs Emacs in its own environment without requiring sudo access. This approach seems to reduce the likelihood of future dependency issues and makes package management easier. Is my understanding correct?
 I also observed that GUIX installed a daemon of some sort. I'm curious if this daemon consumes a significant amount of memory, considering it runs in the background continuously.
 Is it possible to install Emacs using GUIX while allowing the management of other packages to be handled by "use-package" as in my old configuration?

 One example I experienced today. I'm using spacemacs with helm. I did find-file to a remote directory with TRAMP. So I'm in dired. From there I put M-x shell and it asked me the remote shell path. The default shown in helm text area is "/bin/sh" which is a reasonable default. But helm does not let me press enter there. So I can't open a remote shell.
 I thought there would be a way to just force put "/bin/sh", but I couldn't find any ways. C-f, C-z or whatever didn't work. I'm pretty surprised that helm does not have any unified way to fallback if there are no ways for a mature feature that existed such a long time.
 BTW, for that specific issue, I solved it with this elisp code, but I'm still curious if there's a way to fallback on helm.

Hence, I started to code up my own custom quarto-preview function, and continued to further write up some really basic elisp functions to make it work for me.
 My setup is summarised here: https://gist.github.com/fast-90/3d7ce3252fff59b0f6d6d1bcadcf4938
 Basically my workflow is (I only use it with Python):

However, for calendar (keep track of birthdays, holidays, this kind of stuff) or contacts i prefer to use CalDAV and CardDAV since I can use NextCloud for this and also it can well integrate with my smartphone.

 However, Akonadi (the PIM suite from KDE) is pretty unreliable. I'd like to interact with CalDAV and CardDAV from desktop nicely, but it really hangs more often than not. Is there a way to achieve this with Emacs?

 (after! org-download (setq org-download-method 'directory) (setq org-download-image-dir (concat (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name)) "-img")) (setq org-download-image-org-width 600)) 
 links appear as download:<PATH-TO-FILE> instead of file:<PATH-TO-FILE>. Then they don't display correctly unless you manually change that url to file:.
 I assume that it must be detecting the file type and at some point decide to use a specific type of url (there is file: in source code, so it should be possible).
 It seems that by default org-downlaod just uses the standard org-mode's attachment mechanism. The question though is why doesn't changing org-download-method to directory switches it to a "download" url type.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If anyone is interested, I've created an Atom backend for Gnus, which can be found here.
 I posted it to the Emacs development mailing list, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like there's much interest in it currently.
 The only major remaining issue with it is that it doesn't use Gnus' inheritance system, since I keep running into weird issues trying to implement it. If anyone is interested in helping with this I can provide more details. This doesn't affect usage at all, but it kinda sucks because I designed the backend to be very modular so it would be simple to quickly build custom backends.
 To use it, add (or browse) Atom feeds as servers, with the address being the URL of the feed (without a "http://" or "https://" prefix due to a limitation with how Gnus parses group names in some cases unfortunately). For example:
 (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '( nnatom "somewebsite.tld/feed.xml" (nnatom-name "<optional custom name for the group>"))) 
 Each "server" will contain a single group with a name taken from the feed or 'nnatom-name'.
 Some design notes:
  
Atom feed entries (articles) can contain both a summary and "content" (or both, or neither). nnatom saves both, and allows viewing either by making the article multipart when needed.
 Every piece of data extracted from the feed is handled by a separate function, and all Gnus backend interface functions are generic, which allows very simple creation of derivative backends theoretically (you only need to implement a set of parsing functions for your feed).
 Every feed has it's own file for data storage, and those are the only files modified directly by nnatom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm building out my capture templates and I'm mostly squared away (borrowing a bit from Norang actually).
 One of the capture templates I use is for "reminders" these are tasks that I want to show up as a reminder on the agenda but are not TODO entries. A common use for me on these is for meetings. I drop the meeting on my calendar but capture it with a "meeting" capture template that clocks the meeting and I just notate my meeting notes within. 
 To accomplish this I have a top level heading called Reminders and under that I store them:
 If its a one off I use the <2023-06-08 Thu 14:30> type of active timestamp so it shows on the agenda.
 If it is a recurring I use the following which I found online. the 3 means to show every 3rd day of the week. (1 2 3 4 5) would show mon-fri etc. 
 ** Weekly Marketing Meeting 11:00-12:00 :Reminder: <%%(memq(calendar-day-of-week date) '(3))> 
 My one off reminder capture template uses %^T to prompt for and insert an active date+time which works perfectly. 
 I try to include this snippet of text in my capture template where I can just manually update the days I want the reminder to trigger for recurring ones like so
 ("!" "recurring reminder" entry (file "~/Orgfiles/refile.org") "* %? :REMINDER:\n %U\n <%%(memq (calendar-day-of-week date) '(1 2 3 4 5))> 
 \n%a\n%i" :empty-lines 1)
 However when I run the capture I get this output
  <%%![Error: (void-variable date)]> 
 Ideally I'd love to use a prompt for "which days to repeat" where I could input 1 3 5 and get a m/w/f repeater output into the entry. 
 I'm still learning so this might be really simple elisp issue creating the erorr and void variable situation here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought I had got this to work. I was wrong. I am now very confused.
 I want the following characters to pair automatically in org mode: "/" "" "=" "+" "_" "~" "`" (the last to pair with "'", for LaTeX). I also want them to *not pair when point is next to a word. I thought I had everything I wanted with this:
 (defun my/text-electric-pair-inhibit (char) ;; Account for buffer-end weirdness (unless (eq (following-char) 0) (or ;; (electric-pair-inhibit-if-helps-balance char) ;; TODO This logic isn't quite right, check out how ;; `electric-pair-inhibit-if-helps-balance' does it. ;; (electric-pair-conservative-inhibit char) ;; Don't pair after before a word (memq (char-syntax (char-before)) '(?w ?.)) (memq (char-syntax (following-char)) '(?w ?.)) (memq (char-syntax (char-after (- (point) 2))) '(?w ?.))))) (setq electric-pair-inhibit-predicate #'my/text-electric-pair-inhibit) (modify-syntax-entry ?/ "\"" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?* "\"" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?= "\"" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?+ "\"" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?_ "\"" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?~ "\"" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?` "('" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?' ")`" org-mode-syntax-table) 
 But it doesn't work. I get a few different bugs. Most of the time, the pairing works but the inhibition doesn't (characters still pair immediately before or after a word character). Sometimes different characters with the same syntax class behave differently (e.g. "=" and "/", one will be inhibited and the other not). 
 I'm really confused. Any help appreciated.
 TIA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Someone help me out here. I'm following FP in Scala, the red book and I am currently at chapter 4, where we define our own `Option` type. This type, like other collections, takes a covariant type parameter `A`:
 enum Option[+A]: case Some(value: A) case Nothing 
 The book then asks to implement some methods for this type, including:
 def getOrElse[B >: A](default: => B): B = this match case Some(value) => value case Nothing => default 
 This is where the confusion starts. Notice the type parameter annotation `B >: A`. As far as I can tell, this means `B` is a supertype of `A`. I read this as a constraint. I can only pass values of types which are supertypes of `A` to this method. However, the following compiles without any issue:

 for the database I would use postgresql, I found a library here https://github.com/nikita-volkov/hasql

 I'm experimenting with capture templates, in particular to get a diary going for appointments. Here is what I have:
  
'(org-capture-templates '(("d" "Diary" entry (file+olp+datetree "~/org-mode/diary.org") "* %T %?" :time-prompt t)))
  
Just a couple of small questions:
  
What does the '*' mean in the template? I see it in all of them but it's quite a hard thing to search for!
 I quite often get the message 'clipboard pasted as level 4 subtree' when I use this... but I don't want that (and I'm not entirely sure what it means, since it doesn't seem to paste my mac clipboard? maybe the emacs kill ring?)
 How can I do a newline so the timestamp appears below?
  
Simple questions I'm sure, but the notation is a bit overwhelming at first!

I can get all the info I want (10 day view, then unscheduled and expired/older TODOs) in a custom command, but it makes a long buffer and I need to scroll to get to the unscheduled stuff while leaving the right-hand side of the screen mostly empty.
 I'd like to have the standard ten days agenda list on the left, and a column shows me my unscheduled and expired TODOs on the right. I've tried opening the two in separate vertical split windows, but when I change agendas in one window, the other changes too.
 Is there a way to have different agenda views active at the same time? Or to have a single agenda view that flows through vertical columns somehow? Ideally I'd like to open the whole thing with a single command.

 I tried everything and every kind of suggestion present in corfu, orderless or eglot github/wikis. I don't know how to debug it.
 This is a video showing the lag. Sometime the cursor disappears, it just so lagging that typing become frustrating. Video
 This is the output of the profiler profiler
 This is my config config
 Any idea or help is very welcome. Thank you.
 EDIT: BTW I even tried eglot+company without orderless, still the same lag. Even though a little bit less, but still frustratingly present.

 Is there something equivalent for eshell, or can I set up eshell completion to be similarly frictionless?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been coding in Haskell for over 6 years and I still feel as if the lack of dot completion (i.e. completion after typing identifier. in the code editor) is the single thing I miss most compared to mainstream languages. In Haskell I find myself constantly jumping to type definitions, searching for documentation, or even grepping the project to recall the name of a function, when in (say) Rust or Typescript I could type foo. and have the editor show me what I need 90% of the time.
 Edit: Here's a concrete example. I was working on some code with a variable vec :: Vector Int and needed to split it into two vectors based on some predicate. I recall that there is a function for doing exactly this, but can't remember the name. In Haskell this is a situation where I usually find myself Googling for the Data.Vector documentation on Hackage. In other languages I would just type vec. and scan through the completion options to find what I need. This sort of thing happens many times per day and I feel like it makes a big difference in productivity.

 I generally do my reading with epub files on my phone. This has been a pain point for me with emacs, since while it can display epub files with docview (in emacs 29+) it's just images. You can't click on links and it doesn't save your position or anything. Then there's nov for ebook reading specifically, but I wanted to explore this other option, since info-mode is a core part of emacs and is likely to be better integrated with it. Plus, nov isn't in active development.
 So, is there a converter from epub to info specifically for emacs? I tred a few online ones, but when trying to open it emacs complains with No such node or anchor: Top.
 Ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking for a while, but I haven't been able to find "good" resources on utilizing laziness effectively in practical Haskell.
 ​
 There's Hutton's explanation in Programming in Haskell, Bird actually seems to go quickly into laziness (chapters 1,2 of Thinking Functionally With Haskell), but I haven't seen anything like, say, a Serokell article on how to manage laziness in practical terms.
 ​
 Maybe I'm just not trying hard enough? What I'm looking for is:
 --Laziness beyond the lazy infinite list (that's just an iterator / generator function with better syntax).
 --How to effectively exploit laziness to improve algorithmic efficiency.
 --How to avoid space leaks mostly reliably.
 --When space leaks occur, best practices in locating and debugging them.
 ​
 I do have Okasaki (Purely Functional Data Structures) and Bird (Algorithm Design with Haskell), but I haven't seriously gone through them. Are those books sufficient to master laziness / non-strictness to go from "laziness is a 60-40 double-edged sword" to "laziness works for me 90+% of the time"?
 ​
 
 ​
 It matters because, well, you have firms that deliberately choose a strict dialect of Haskell (SC, Mu), you have firms that go to -XStrict by default (NRI, Key.me), and, well, Purescript is strict, Idris is strict; Haskell is rare in making non-strict / lazy evaluation its default, and as functional programming becomes increasingly mainstream, Haskell's main long-term selling point will be its experiment with lazy-by-default.
 ​
 However, lazy-by-default is best known for the resulting space leaks, not for its expressiveness advantages. For I myself, I'd like to have a list of resources to understand how to get pervasive laziness not to screw me, but rather be a useful tool, and I think it'd be useful to be able to redirect skeptics and newbies to a laziness resource list.

 For quite some time now I've been happy with the nord theme, but I'm running into an issue where certain text in ESS is basically unreadable. 
 Here's a screenshot depicting my trouble: https://imgur.com/a/yuNePvZ
 Note in particular the right hand buffer where the output from R is showing me the results of loading the tidyverse package (the bold, kinda royal blue text) and also the output of the dataframe's contents (the dark text that's almost unreadable).
 If I put point over the gray text and invoke M-x describe-char I get:
 There is an overlay here: From 1682 to 1697 evaporate t face (:foreground "gray30") insert-behind-hooks (ansi-color-freeze-overlay) modification-hooks (ansi-color-freeze-overlay) 
 I can click the (:foreground "gray30") bit which brings me to a Help buffer with the following contents:
 Face: :foreground undefined face. 
 That's basically where I hit a dead-end because it's not clear to me how to proceed beyond just blindly grepping through code in ESS and nord-theme. So I guess my questions are:
  
how do I figure out what "gray30" is and where it comes from
 why it's undefined
 how do I change that to be something more readable?
  
edit: In case anyone else stumbles across this from Google, I believe I am experiencing the issue described here

A bit of context: I am on 29.0.91, Mac OSX, I use lsp(pylsp)+lsp-ui+company+flycheck+treesitter. Occasionally, pylsp fails in some way, via a timeout or an actual bug. This is fine, but I sometimes can't keep going because my syntax highlighting stops updating. I understand that LSP servers will sometimes have bugs and fail - it is a hard problem, but I'd like to make emacs robust to this: how can I make it so other aspects of my emacs setup, especially syntax highlighting and basic emacs functionality, are robust to failures in LSP mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have installed Jedi - the python autocomplete package - on my emacs. The autocomplete feature is great, but causes me issues when I am navigating through the code. 
 A simple example is: when I comment a line in my code, and try to move to the line above or below, I can't do it. This is because the auto-complete pops up, and it scrolls through those options rather than go up or down in my code. As a result, every time I need to comment -> move left -> move up, instead of just moving up. Commenting is just one example. There are several other times (changing variables and so on) where this happens.
 I want the autocomplete to help me when I am trying to finish a variable or call a function, not unnecessarily bother me like this. Do you guys know of any solution to fix this? Maybe changing the keys for scrolling through autocomplete might help (although that might make it difficult to use it in normal circumstances, I am open to ideas). Any suggestions are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-refile to navigate and file things all the time. While it is functional, I have long craved something a little more flexible.
 So I've written a package that allows you to programmatically set composable shortcuts for org-refile.
 https://github.com/thread314/org-navigator
 It allows the user to set prefix shortcut keys to various actions (refile to, go-to, clock in to etc), and combine these with suffix keys that define the target for the desired action.
 So for example, typing C-c fa might file the current subtree to the subtree set to "a", whereas C-c ia would instead jump to that subtree and open it in an indirect buffer.
 It also allows the user to define the destination suffix keys by setting a property on the target subtree itself from within the org-mode file.
 I'm not a programmer so always very open to any feedback or suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I’m learning haskell for the 2nd time and this time it’s really cliking and I love it.
 The problem is I need to find a project where I can use it. 
 I’m an embedded engineer, I mostly do linux stuff and sometimes bare metal, I mainly use cpp. My dev set up is mainly comprised of neovim and terminal app. 
 Ideally I would love to create a tool that I would use often and keep expanding so that I keep practicing haskell. 
 Any idea? :)

 I use scrivener for larger project planning and overseeing, as I like the way to organize documents there; however I only want to hop into it once every couple of weeks.
 Daily, I use emacs, and I would love to be able to just work with one or 2 documents in org mode on the fly as needed.
 Anyone familiar with a way that this might be easily done?

 Sharing a short note about upcoming Iron library updates. The next release enables the convenient turning of opaque types into value objects with optional validation and neat subtyping.
 So, we'll be able to do things like: scala opaque type Temperature = Double :| Positive object Temperature extends RefinedTypeOps[Temperature] 
 and after both value and apply are in place for iron&opaque types: ``` val t1 = Temperature(100) val t2 = Temperature(100)
 val result = t1.value + t2.value ```
 The note itself: Iron updates: turning opaque types into value objects
 And there is a beginner-friendly ticket: Add alias for True constraint and IronType[A, True]
 Thank you!

 Alternatively, does anybody offer hourly tutoring/consulting for macros? I'm using them for a side project, so don't have any colleagues to bounce things off of.

 I'm starting with reproducible research in MySQL using org-babel.
 https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-sql.html
 I am able to connect to the remote host (manual SSH tunnel), but the configuration of dbhost/dbuser and so on needs to be applied to each block. Is it possible to have some macro that would expand during execution? Let's say my init.el has predefined values for each of the databases I use. In the org doc, I would be able to reference (like #+use_headers: this_db). I know I can have macros that would type all those headers, but having this data present in each file makes it less readable and adds some chance of data leakage.

 I managed to set them up in Emacs, but I wonder if Emacs can stretch the font, or make it lighter?
 I'm using this to define the fonts in init.el, but the width and weight are completely ignored:
  (setq my-font "PragmataPro Mono Liga-12") (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family my-font :width 'extra-expanded :weight 'light) (setq my-font "PragmataPro Liga-12") (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family my-font :width 'extra-expanded :weight 'light) (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family my-font :width 'extra-expanded :weight 'light) (set-frame-font my-font nil t)

 However, if I run the same command using M-x shell and then typing it out manually, it works as expected. It also works in vterm as well as my terminal outside of Emacs.
 I have tried to check relevant (environment) variables between shell-command and shell, but I can't notice any difference. For the avoidance of doubt I mainly checked the following: - echo $VIRTUAL_ENV - which jupyter - jupyter kernelspec list (both show that my kernel is available, even when using shell command
 Can anyone explain me where the difference could lie between the different results between shell-command and shell? Is there any way to execute a command as if it was executed using shell?

The way I write notes is a bit different compared to the classical note-taking style or the Zettelkasten Method.
Suppose I was learning about Moravec's Paradox. Here is my typical workflow.
I first go through the learning process. To learn about these things, we basically consume some form of a source like the Wikipedia page, articles, explanations, videos, etc. On a side note, I always do a syntopical reading (coined by Adler I guess?!), I never read about a topic only from one source. I at least use two, to get a better understanding of it. Anyways, so I read and read and watch and watch and as I am going along with it I am learning in my head by doing all those wonderful things that my brain can do, thinking, analyzing, critiquing, understanding, comparing, blah blah bl…]]></summary>

 -- >>> map (+2) [1,5,7] 
 the comment block gets replaced with:
 -- >>> map (+2) [1,5,7] -- [3,7,9] 
 Is this possible to replicate in Emacs?
 Or to phrase my question differently, in Lisp mode, Emacs has the key binding C-j (which executes eval-print-last-sexp) to evaluate Lisp code and insert its output in the buffer. Is there an equivalent mechanism for evaluating code in other major modes? Can this be achieved with lsp-mode or eglot maybe?

 I have noticed that in Emacs word "manger" has been replaced with "archive" is this because their is a difference between a package manger and a package archive? Is it called an archive in Emacs instead of a manger for a reason?
 I'm almost certain that they are they are the same thing just different names but wanted to make sure. 
 Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.

I mean, a user can define a gesture, putting middle finger out, as M-x, followed by a sequence of ninjutsu, like the Naruto things. Then a command will prompt out as you wish. And you can still fully use all the .emacs things in that case. 
 Are you looking forward this device? How are you going to adapt it into your daily use? What things cannot be done rightnow but super easy for using it on visionOS? Love to hear your voice.

 ​
 I currently am reading a paper (to be found here https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02856.pdf ) that includes some haskell code. The authors made some statements about various topics, some more some less related to functional programming that left me a little confused. I would be really grateful if someone could help me to better my understanding here. I will be marking the section concerned with quotes:

Page 1: "A standard CSE transformation can rewrite this to [...] which can be computed more efficiently".Q: Why can it be computed more efficiently? Because of the evaluation order of the let binding? My intuition tells me because we're only evaluation the subexpression once and binding it to a name, rather than evaluating the same expression twice. Does CSE alwa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use my init.el byte compiled. It works, but if it is further native compiled (automatically), it doesn't. The problem is with packages which are loaded in a deferred way. Native compile doesn't have a chance to know whether a particular call is a macro or a function. For example, if my init.el is this:
 (with-eval-after-load "evil" (evil-define-key 'normal Info-mode-map (kbd "m") 'Info-menu)) 
 It works if init.el is just byte-compiled. But native compilation gives a warning:
 init.el:3:4: Warning: the function ‘evil-define-key’ is not known to be defined. 
 (Note with init.el is so small, it seems that native compilation doesn't happen automatically, so you may have to run (native-compile "~/.emacs.d/init.el") manually to reproduce this)
 And later I indeed have a problem when I restart emacs (it tries to call evil-define-key as a function, but it's not found because it's a macro)
 What could be the solution for this problem? Note, that I have almost everything loaded in a deferred way. One possible solution I see is that I load all the deferred packages somehow (is there an emacs/use-package function for this?), then call native-compile manually (instead of relying of the automatic native compilation) to make sure that native-compile sees all the macros.

 Newbie to Org-mode here. I think this will be easy to answer to most of you. I see a problem with creating a new bullet list item:
 For example when I am beneath a header with a bunch of bullets and I hit M-RET , this by default should execute: 
 org-insert-item 
 What I get instead is that Emacs creates a new same-level heading beneath last bullet ( even cuts remaining text from above bullet text
 ** Heading 2
 - Item
 ** 1
 Support to create new bullet underneath Item 1 but I get only 1 with same heading level as above.
 Any ideas ? It worked and now all of the sudden it stopped.
 I have following packages installed for org mode: "org", "org-bullets"

 Thank you

 I know I can add :tangle $file on the tail of the begin_src line, and that I can specify #+property: header-args :tangle $file at the top of the file, but suppose I want to be lazy, and say that all blocks under top level headline “A” are to be tangled to file “A” and everything under headline “B” go into file “B”?
 Is this doable?

In the spirit of this quote, I was thinking to myself, "What is the problem situation that the ZKM was created for?"
In the Introduction to the ZKM article @Sascha said that it, "is a holistic method on how to deal with knowledge in your life." So, it would seem that it is, in part, helping with managing your knowledge outside of our memory system. I think elsewhere it is referred to as "a personal tool for thinking and writing." Which, I think helps to see more of the picture of the problem situation. Knowledge. Thinking. Writing.
I'd love to hear some thoughts from others in this forum on how they'd answer this question.

 A few days went by with no hiccups. Then seemingly out of nowhere, whenever I opened my Org files, all of my lines ended in dos carriage returns, ^M. Moreover, it opened a popup buffer that said there was an encoding conflict with the inputting encoding system and the underlying default. I didn't document it and have been unable to reproduce it. 
 To get rid of it, I have to M-x revert-buffer-with-coding-system RET utf-8-dos every time I open an org-file. 
 Does anyone know of a more permanent solution? Thanks in advance.

 this problem is making me mad.I would like to be able to select \frac{any text}{any text}, I tried with evil-object but the documentation that i found is quite short. So I tried with emacs function:

 This is what I came up with, but work only partially, and wrong sometimes.I could implement it?Thanks 
 EDIT: 
 (defun select-latex-frac () "Visually selects the LaTeX fraction expression under point." (interactive) (save-excursion (re-search-backward "\\\\frac{[^{}]*}{[^{}]*}") (setq start (match-beginning 0)) (setq end (match-end 0)) (evil-visual-make-selection start end))) 
 This work better but now I have some problem with expression like:
  \frac{\frac{prova}{prova}}{\sum^{}}

 How do org-mode/org-roam peeps integrate Slack with their systems and remain GTD productive? 
 The Longer Tale
 Perhaps more a general r/emacs question than org-mode but I'm very curious how people use org-mode and Slack together, particularly in terms of capturing TODOS and generally being productive and relating things back to source material. 
 In general, I find Slack turns my highly efficient, inbox-zero, mail-based, David-Allen-esque GTD system to swiss cheese by creating about 200 "inboxes", so I"m kinda wondering what other org-mode-ians do, and what the mu4e equivalent might be to Slack vs mail (to be clear, I use gmail's web interface even for mail, but lean into org-mode to manage notes and TODOs). 
 Would love to hear what's working for people vs not. (rather than us all griping about Slack... =] I'm not a fan of the tool, but feel most of its problems are around the way people use it, rather than the tool itself — despite the discourse and twist folks trying to convince me to give those a go at my company. =] ).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I had written a package that allow using org-ql with org-roam:
 https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/org-roam-ql
 The idea was to make org-ql aware of the org-roam database. The package also allows viewing the content of an org-roam buffer in an org-ql-view buffer, which would allow querying based on the nodes, or vice versa, viewing the content of a org-ql-view in a org-roam-like buffer.
 Switching from an org-roam buffer to a org-ql buffer, narrowing the results using org-ql then rending the results in an org-roam-like buffer (which I am org-roam-ql buffers)
 Querty the org-roam database
 It's my first package and I am still working on it. I would love to hear any feedback on it :)

Restarting the Archive did not fix this issue. I don't believe I have messed with ln and such here, so no symbolic links business is involved. Finally, all this is under git, in case that is somehow implicated.

 base32-0.3 is out now, with extended support for GHCs 8.10 thru 9.6, as well as a text and bytestring min version bump. 
 This will be the last in the 0.x series for this library. base32, along withbase16 and base64, are nearing the release of a new epoch 1.x version cycle. In addition to various reworkings of the core apis for all of the base encoding libraries will come a focus on newtyped inputs and outputs, allowing for encode/decode, as well as support for SIMD-enabled loops for architectures that support it. 
 Cheers, Emily

 I'm playing around with my emacs config.Using use-package lazy loading options I settled down to ~0.4 s startup time with ~120 packages.Is possible to get even lower?
 At the moment evil and projectile are taking up 0.050 s, can I maybe shave down from projectile?
 I'm doing this just for fun, 0.4 s is already ultra fast enough, with emacsclient I get as low as 0.35 s ish
 This is my emacs config: https://github.com/Stefanomarton/DotFiles/tree/master/.config/emacs, maybe could be useful to someone.
 Thanks to anyone suggesting something 
 EDIT: maybe there is a specific order in which load stuff?

Looking at the GitHub issues, I think the package isn't getting the TLC it needs.
 I'm not eager to try fixing Outshine myself, so what would you suggest as alternative approaches for code folding or navigating large files? I have low vision, so I use big fonts, so I don't have many lines of code on screen at once, generally about 20.

 VSCode hilighting
 Any idea on how to fix this and get complete VSCode like hilighting? If you notice here `isLoading` and `setIsLoading` are also different because one is a variable and other is a function. I guess VScode knows this because of semantic hilighting from lsp? 
 I guess eglot doesn't support it yet: https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/pull/839
 But I thought atleast typescript would be smart enough to highlight `setError` correctly to pink in the emacs case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use default key bindings and meow, on Japanese keyboard with the help of key re-mapper called keyd for linux, and sharpkeys for windows. Here are the reasons.
 - Emacs default key bindings are the ones that are also used in other programs, like terminal. Getting used to text-operation stuff (like C-a/M-f) to some extent makes consistency.
 - I use Japanese keyboard on desktop and laptop so that I can remap <muhenkan>, <henkan>, and <katakanahiragana> key (they are on my thumbs position) to control, shift, and escape key. I want my keyboard layout to be the same on desktop and laptop, so thumb clusters keyboards are not my choice.
 - I use meow for modal editing. I've used evil, but I didn't like to configure evil key bindings for every different mode. I also didn't like to disable evil completely for some modes. I just wanted to use j/k and J/K (I map J/K to scroll up/down faster) in certain modes like magit, that do not require much text editing. The thing I like the most about meow is its motion mode. In motion mode, I can use j/k and J/K to scroll, and if I wanted to dispatch keys that are bound in major-mode maps, I can simply prefix them with SPC key (the default is Hyper key, I changed it). In magit for example, I can dispatch k (magit-discard) by pressing SPC-k. Any keys that are not in motion mode map follow the major mode map. I do not use meow keypad because I'm comfortable with pressing control key. But for those who are not, meow keypad might be good.
 ​
 What do you think? I see a key bindings discussion occasionally here so hope this helps.
 I would very appreciate your suggestion.

For example, if I could hover over a file in Dired and have something like a org-capture template menu of categories/operations pop up according to the files extension. I was thinking of how useful this would be for being able to define commands for file compression or (extension-specific) conversion in a config.
 Alternatively if anyone knows of a method to could accomplish something similar to this would be appreciated, I'd just be interested in having a good way to run common commands on files from Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 I'm relatively new to Emacs and I'm trying to figure out which text-inputting framework I should use. I've never used Vim before, and I don't think I ever will. I have a keyboard with thumb clusters, which eliminates the issue of the "Emacs pinky" entirely. In fact, I find myself preferring chorded commands because they make me feel like a Jedi, with my keyboard as a lightsaber of sorts. It all started with cut/copy/paste when I was a child, and Emacs' style of running commands feels more like magical sorcery to me.
 Moreover, I use a different keyboard layout than the standard "QWERTY," so the default movement keys in Vim ("HJKL") are less convenient for me.
 I've noticed that switching between insert and normal mode in Evil Mode throws me off a bit, but maybe I just need to get used to it. I often hear people say that Evil Mode is a superior way to edit text compared to the default Emacs keybindings. However, I wonder if this preference is mostly driven by those who started with Vim and are already used to modal editing.
 I'm curious to hear your thoughts. In your opinion, what makes modal editing either superior/inferior? I'm particularly interested in hearing from those who have switched from Emacs to Vim (lol), especially if they inadvertently got used to Emacs keybindings first.
 Looking forward to your insights!

But I don't see any changes, the behavior is the same before and after loading the advices.
 My config is: elisp (use-package pcmpl-args :after eshell :demand nil :config (advice-add 'pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #'cape-wrap-silent) (advice-add 'pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #'cape-wrap-purify)) 
 Which expands to: elisp (eval-after-load 'eshell '(progn (require 'pcmpl-args nil nil) (advice-add 'pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #'cape-wrap-silent) (advice-add 'pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #'cape-wrap-purify) t))) 
 cape is loaded with emacs initalization so I think it's irelevant, but here is anyway: elisp (use-package cape :defer 1 :config (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions 'cape-file)) 
 (I tried to open this issue on both cape and corfu repos but github blocked me and I don't know why)

So is there some workaround to this or should i just pick a different language for my compiler (Which would be sad since i really like haskell).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new 3.3.0 release of Scala introduced an interesting new syntactic feature (first proposed in SIP-44 - FEWER BRACES).
 I had some fun implementing a Scala version of Python's with statement :
 Python version:
 with open(filename) as f: content = f.readlines() for line in content: print(line) 
 Scala version:
 with_ (open(filename)): f => val content = f.readLines() content.foreach: println(_) 
 Behind the scenes:
 def with_[A](expression: A)(suite: A => Unit): Unit = val manager = expression val enter = try manager.getClass().getDeclaredMethod("__enter__") catch _ => null val exit = try manager.getClass().getDeclaredMethod("__exit__") catch _ => null val value = if enter != null then enter.invoke(manager).asInstanceOf[A] else manager try suite(value) catch case e: Exception => println(e) finally if exit != null then exit.invoke(manager) 
 My implementation is obviously highly inspired by Python's. For example, by defining a simple file I/O wrapper with __enter__ and __exit__ methods we can nicely and properly handle file reading and writting.
 Let me know what you think and if you have other ideas!

 For context I work as a web developer with node (with express), react and vue. 
 Most job postings I see usually mention http4s and specifically mention having experience with libraries other than Play is a plus. Would learning http4s would be a good idea, from what I understand it’s more fp and the only fp knowledge I have is from an university course in Clisp.
 I would appreciate any recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm using dirvish for browsing folders and appreciate the plain text preview feature. 
 It is working surprisingly well even for office documents with the help of some external libraries (pandoc, pdftotext, etc...) : https://i.imgur.com/ZET3dWt.png 
 and ability to register your own dirvish-preview-dispatchers. 
 Example with docx file : 
  ;; register a plain text dirvish dispatcher for docx files (dirvish-define-preview docx (file ext) "Preview docx files in plain text Require: `pandoc' (executable)" :require ("pandoc" ) (cond ((equal ext "docx") `(shell . ("pandoc" "-t" "plain",file))))) (add-to-list 'dirvish-preview-dispatchers 'docx) 
 I'm however struggling with pptx extension as I need to chain execution of 2 commands : 
  
pptx2md for converting PPTX to markup files 
 pandoc for markup files to plain text. 
  
I've tried to use " && " like this : 
 ;; register a plain text dirvish dispatcher for PPTX files (dirvish-define-preview pptx (file ext) "Preview PPTX files in plain text Require: `pptx2md' & `pandoc' (executables)" :require ("pptx2md") :require ("pandoc") (cond ((equal ext "pptx") `(shell . ("pptx2md", "--disable-image",file,"&& pandoc","-f","markdown","->t","plain","out.md")))) ) (add-to-list 'dirvish-preview-dispatchers 'pptx) 
 but end up with this output in my buffer : 
 usage: pptx2md [-h] [-t TITLE] [-o OUTPUT] [-i IMAGE_DIR] [--image-width IMAGE_WIDTH] [--disable-image] [--disable-wmf] [--disable-color] [--disable-escaping] [--wiki] [--mdk] [--min-block-size MIN_BLOCK_SIZE] pptx_path pptx2md: error: unrecognized arguments: && pandoc -f markdown out.md 
 I understand why I have this issue, and think it will be possible to fix it by creating my own shell script mixing both commands, but would like to know what is proper way to handle this in elisp. 
 Any ideas ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working on an emacs configuration for myself. I'm coming from NeoVim and VSCode and both of those have a pretty easy way to fuzzy search for files in the current directory. VSCode has this built in and NeoVim can do this through telescope.
 It feels like there isn't a "simple" solution to this in emacs. find-file more or less requires me to type the path. Yes you get tab completion, but that's still pretty slow in comparison. And beyond that i seem to get into selectrum, orderless, marginalia and what not, which for one doesn't seem to solve this problem either, and feels needlessly complex for what i'm trying to do.
 So, my workflow has always been that i open my editor in my main projects directory. When i want to open a file, i press a hotkey and start searching with file and folder names. In 99.99% of cases i know exactly how the file is named and where it's located. I just don't want to have to type out the path. I'd rather type the parts of the path that are unique and get there quickly.
 What's the simplest solution for this? All i really need is a wrapper around fzf. fzf.el would do what i need, but doesn't work on windows. There is a fork of fzf.el that "should" fix that but i can't get it to work. I'm also not too sure how to point use-package to a random git repository rather than what's on melpa.

No
 Yes
  
For many decades editors have been unable to do simple things. Like correctly color variables. That is until now. Emacs 29 treesit is here. It is going to enable so many new features.
  
paredit/lispy edits for all languages? check!
 highlight thing at point, in a scope sensitive way? check!
 sticky scroll? check!
 Syntax highlighting that actually works right? check!
  
4 decades of being unable to add color to variables has passed. Programmers have been born, lived, and retired all under that era. This is all about to change. These insurmountable problems are about to become EASY to solve. YOU can implement the features that were impossibly hard for the previous generation. YOU can implement an object-at-point highlighter that is more performant and correct than ever. All you need to know is how to walk a tree.
 Trees are really what enable lisp's special powers. Lisp's tree nature is what made it possible to easily make advanced modes like paredit. Now everyone is about to have their tree exposed to package developers, not just lisp. The other languages always had a tree, it was just hidden. Adding treesitter to Emacs is more than just another feature. It is lisp-esque. It will pave the way to true editing features.

I am a Bookends user, and I have a nice collection of PDFs associated with references. I was able to dump the references into a *.bibtex file and import it into bibdesk, but I don't know how I can attach those PDFs to references in BibDesk. Does someone here know?
Also, bookends supports what they call, I think, "floating citations", where pressing alt-alt in The Archive brings up a small window where I can search a reference and it pastes, for example, [@Smith1976] into the Archive. This too I'd love to replicate, but if not available, I can script it easily enough using an unholy mix of Python and Keyboard Maestro and Alfred.
Why I want to switch: Bookends isn't very git-friendly; they produce a binary file containing the references instead of a text file like bibtex.
Many thanks!]]></summary>

 I've been trying to set up Doom Emacs with a configuration from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/slano-ls/Doom-Emacs-Config and ran into some issues.
 Firstly, the installation process was a bit challenging. I followed the steps to clone both Doom Emacs and the configuration repository, but I've been encountering errors saying that Emacs cannot find my config.el file. I did ensure that the file exists in the appropriate directory, though.
 Secondly, I've had trouble with having Emacs recognized in my $PATH. I installed Emacs using Homebrew and attempted to add it to my $PATH, but the Doom installation script keeps telling me that it can't run Emacs.
 To summarize, I've got two main issues:
  
Emacs/Doom Emacs can't seem to find my config.el file.
 Having trouble getting Emacs to be recognized in my $PATH.
  
I'd greatly appreciate it if anyone could provide some guidance, tips, or resources to help me sort these issues out and get more comfortable with Emacs on macOS. I've been searching and trying out solutions, but as a beginner, it's been quite overwhelming.
 Thanks in advance!
 P.S. If there's any additional information you need, please let me know. I'm keen to learn and make this work!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started a mooc which uses Emacs. I have only previously used Dr.Racket and Anaconda so I'm having trouble with how I actually run programs in Emacs.
 I did the tutorial which covers how to edit and navigate text, open and save files.
 I just don't understand how you actually write some code and run it?
 In Dr.Racket or Anaconda, I could write some function in say python, that asks user for two numbers, and returns their sum. I'd write the code, click run, it would prompt me for the two numbers, I'd enter them and it would return their sum.
 Can anyone explain how I would do this in Emacs? I understand it's more powerful text editor I just really can't see how to do something simple like the above. I would like to learn how to use Emacs, and the course videos are all done using Emacs so ideally I'd like to be able to follow along with the videos.
 So yea if someone could explain how I could do what I know how to do in Anaconda, just write a simple function, run it and interact with it, then get a return. I think it might really help me understand the difference between Emacs and Anaconda etc. All the tutorials just talk about editing text. Not writing code, running it and giving it input and seeing the output? I'm sure I'm missing something very obvious but just struggling to see how you go from the text editing to actually running code I have written?

 It's better than nothing, but one doesn't go the emacs route for "better than nothing". It's not showing symbols. E.g. vscode shows symbols:

 lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-icons-enable is already set to t if someone is going to suggest that.

 I am new to emacs and Org Mode. But I'm looking to step up my personal notes game and move away from proprietary systems.
 My hope is to use Spacemacs on my various computer and beorg on my phone and iPad to give me a good note and 'second brain' system.
 This is probably a real simple question, but I have only been at this since yesterday...
 Is there a way to scape a web page into Org format and include it in my notes? Or possiblt just scrape paert of a web page and convert it into org mode.

 Given a csv file with columns A, B, C; and rows 1, 2, 3... how do I turn that into a tree, walking it column first?
 So ~~~ | | A | B | C | | 1 | | | | | 2 | | | | | 3 | | | | ~~~
 becomes: ~~~ A *1 *2 *3 B *1 *2 *3 C *1 *2 *3 ~~~
 I saw "GitHub - emacsmirror/org-transform-tree-table: Transform org-mode tree with properties to a table, and the other way around" (https://github.com/emacsmirror/org-transform-tree-table) but it works on properties, not the cell value...
 I'm sure there is something there (and of course 1st I searched on emacs itself), but can't find it... I must be using wrong keywords.
 Thanks a ton. :)

I found some discussion on this by searching for org-mode with synctex, but the most recent attention this problem got in the mailing list was from 2010. Have there been any updates?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because tree sitter is making a nice opportunity for us to evolve Emacs bindings, I have been pulling together some POC work into a package called user-keys.
 So far it's useful for Elisp programmers. I'm undecided about whether or how to take it to the next level for users. The state of progress:
  
reports and extensible tools for keymap analysis 
 shadows (every single map that binds C-n for example)
 "stupid keys" that you want to delete everywhere
 preferred bindings state
 
 macro proof of concept for abstract key bindings, an idea I've pushed on emacs devel to make ad-hoc conventions like C-n configurable to the user
 lots of groundwork for mass rebinding or unbinding
  
some of the kinds or report generation I created earlier.
 I was going to spike the code and use it as a demonstration for writing a transient UI, but I'm a little unclear on where to deliver the most value. I'm not super committed to this package, but felt it had too much utility already to keep it to myself.
 I'm interested in feature requests, hopes and dreams, (and support for the package or other packages I'm working on).
 I've been getting a lot of value out of the elisp repo kit (erk) and was able to use a normal TDD style like a civilized person, really making things go faster. I also got some more experience with the dash library and of course immense exposure to the weirdness of Emacs keymap data.

 So I want to just completely uninstall emacs and start over again.
 How ever when I run "brew remove emacs"
 i get the error "Error: cask "emacs" is not installed"
 I have been using it and went through the tutorial so I really don't understand why I can't uninstall? I'm completely new to using command line and emacs so I dont even know where to begin. I tried to just remove it from applications folder but there is still several associated files when I search emacs.
 Ideally I'd like to understand what this error means and how to completely uninstall emacs and all the associated files. Can anyone please explain why I'm getting this error after I had been succesfully running emacs? surely everything must have been there to be able to open and complete the tutorial?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm using Wanderlust for years, and just now I discovered this issue/problem:
  
I am using Wanderlust (v. 2.15.9) on my main machine and it works just perfect.
 
I am using rsync to "clone" literally whole home folder on my laptop, when I am going on the roads. So I have the same behaviour, messages, notes… in (on) my laptop.
 
Wanderlust (and Emacs of course) works fine, except:
 
I can not delete message(s) from remote (POP) folder, after marking with d and pressing x I get a error message "1 execution(s) were failed" (or more than 1, depends on Nr. of marked messages).
 
 What can be a reason of this?
 Note: I can delete messages from local folders (stored on HDD).
 All the settings like .wl, .folders… are the same.
 Does anybody has any idea how to solve this (actually I can still delete messages from webmail or telnet, this is not a problem, but it's little-bit annoying)?
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys
 I use org-change-tag-in-region a lot in my daily routine. I love it because I can set or unset tags in a huge block of stuff. However, what bugs me is this: When I mark a region to tag/untag all the selected items, it will unmark the items after I set or remove a tag. Is there a way to keep the selection on the text so I don't have to mark it all over again to set/unset more tags?
 ty!

the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler (GHC).
The back end includes a new translation for control flow, which enables GHC to avoid depending on external tools like Binaryen.
Because the translation is new, we wanted to test it before submitting a merge request.
And classic unit testing was not a good fit—we would have needed to know what
the WebAssembly code was
expected to be generated from any given fragment of Haskell,
and that’s a job for a compiler, not an engineer.
Fortunately, we don’t care
how generated code is written; we care about how it behaves.
Code’s behavior can be tested by running it, but we wanted to test the translation before integrating it with GHC. So we
simulated translated code by tracing possible
executions…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to be a VSCode user. I'm a programmer and make my living doing web development these days. Last year I decided I wanted to give Emacs a try. I went for Doom Emacs with the intent of someday making my own config. I used it for a good 6 months at least and fell in love with Emacs. I also decided I wanted to give neovim a fair try. 
 I made a neovim config from scratch. It took me 2 days but I got a really good config which does almost everything I want and I use that as my daily editor for my work without any problems. 
 After I made my neovim config I decided I wanted to make my own Emacs config from scratch and started on tha endeavor. I am so heartbroken to say that after having sunk more than a month into it, having read the 300 pages of the book "Mastering Emacs" by Mickey Peterson, I'm nowhere close to done. Nothing seems to work like it should. Adding a new packages breaks the functionality of the old ones for whatever reason. 
 I upgraded from emacs 28 to 29 and lsp that worked about fine on my config now doesn't work. Company mode seems broken as well. I really want to love Emacs and I've been at it for months now. It's starting to seem like a fool's errand at this point. 
 after spending almost a year between neovim and emacs, it's starting to feel like VSCode wasn't all that bad. It did almost everything I wanted from it and I didn't have to feel like I was fighting against the very tool that's supposed to make me productive.

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0d7_MJmsKQ&list=PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7&index=4
 In this episode, Edsko will give a user's perspective on falsify, his new library for property based testing in Haskell, inspired by the Hypothesis library for Python. This episode will be suitable for beginners. 
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks. You can use the link above to get to the playlist and watch the other episodes.
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes: https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder

 Does anyone think that we should have an official Emacs emoji? You can apply for one for free: https://emojipedia.org/proposals/#:~:text=Anyone%20can%20submit%20a%20proposal,and%20cannot%20already%20be%20represented.
 Now, I know what you're thinking:
  
Emacs people don't use Emojis
  
A: Well, some of us *do* use them. A lot. Even inside of Emacs.
  
They're not going to give it for a piece of software
  
A: Well, Emacs isn't just a piece of software. It's seen as a philosophy by most people who even know what it is. So maybe we can apply for it under that banner?
 I know the chances of it being approved would be slim but it *is* kind of unique and it *is* a philosophy to many people. So maybe?
 Again: I'm not expecting a huge response but I figured maybe some here might agree and try anyway?
 Thanks for reading. 🙃

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
I adopted a Plain Text workflow a few years ago. I am on Linux/Windows environments. I'm not tied to any editor (hence my use of markdown). I use various VIM flavors, VS Code, notepad, and have tried emacs, Zettlr and Obsidian. I'm fairly comfortable using any of those but am mainly using Zettlr right now. I use pandoc to generate most everything I need either to HTML, docx or PDF via LaTeX. My reference manager of choice is Zotero. I use hypothes.is "somewhat," but not much. I haven't figured out a good way to just pipe those notes into Zotero where I'd prefer them. My "inbox" is Zotero.
Why am I looking at Zettelkasten after all these years? Because I'm adventuring out into new phases in my life where I think notetaking and writing are going to become far more important. Mainly in the area of Genealogy. Genealogy has overlap with many topics/cross-overs in history, anthropology, social sciences, archive/library science, DNA, general research, writing. I need a better way to process and use information. While I have degrees in history, anthropology, and engineering, I've work in more practical fields, mainly Tech, for years and am well out of practice in research and writing.
Since I haven't seriously written or researched in years, I need to shake the rust off. As part of that effort, I want better techniques to process and store what I've read. I think the "commonplace" tradition (and I fit Zettelkasten in that category for this discussion) is the only methodology that seriously considers the process of taking notes and tying them together. There is, I believe, a fairly complete workflow from figuring out what to read, how to read it, how to take notes about it, how to process those notes (including storage), how to tie notes together, and how to use them for output.
Also, it seems to be the most amenable method to fit into my plain text workflow.
I do have more specific questions, mainly around my notes in Zotero and what to do with them, but I will post them separately.]]></summary>

I've been using LanguageTool since 2019 because it's open source and has some level of Emacs integration, but I'm not happy with it anymore as it lets some critical grammar mistakes slide. For instance, LanguageTool couldn't detect the two grammar issues here, while Grammarly was able to:
 "I’m in a plane. I thought classes today." 
 I'm used to writing markdowns on Emacs, but I don't think my setup is adequate anymore.

Depending on everyone's general availability, we could do something on a quiet day over the summer break?

Do you find yourselves also doing this? Writing little short descriptions on how to do things? If you do, I'm curious to know what kind of strategy you use for this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to set up certain interactions between my window manager (Hyprland) and Emacs, and for various reasons just matching window titles is no longer sufficient. Specifically, I need the minibuffer frame to have a wm_class other than emacs.
 Setting the title is just  (add-to-list 'minibuffer-frame-alist '(title . "uniquename")) 
 However this doesn't change the class, nor does there appear to be a class frame parameter. Parameters I have tried that don't work: class, name, role, instance, x-class, wm-class. 
 I've looked thru the manual and did not find anything related to the Class of frames, only titles and internal parameters.
 It appears from https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/60168/how-can-i-set-wm-class-for-emacs-27 and the bug report linked therein that name used to do this but no longer does because of GTK or something.
 I'd prefer not to rely on Emacsclient as that interferes with other things.
 What are we supposed to do in this case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a minor thing, but I took the jump to emacs 29 to start updating configs and such, and was moderately dismayed to note that pretty-mode is somehow not working... most of the time.
 And I'm not sure how to diagnose. I had followed the (older) base instructions from Mastering Emacs (http://www.modernemacs.com/post/prettify-mode/), with `(pretty-activate-groups '(sub-and-superscripts :greek :arithmetic-nary))` and a set of `prettify-symbols-alist` pairs for Python. 
 ...the prettify-symbols-alist pairs work (but look different...sometimes)
 ...the ligatures work...
 ...but greek symbols are nowhere to be found (seemingly in python-mode and python-ts-mode). It's a minor thing, but since there's a lot of mathematical programming involved, I rather miss it. I don't see any error messages in *Messages* but I'm not sure what I would be looking for.
 Any suggestions? I feel appropriately foolish...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I would like to prevent completions from being suggested to the empty string in inferior-python-mode. 
 To explain a bit better - when the prompt or the string is empty, there are no completions proposed. When I type something, say "a", I get a number of completions (such as abs, all, any, etc.). 
 If I backspace and get back to the empty string, instead of just getting back to a normal cursor, I get empty string completions such as "%%!", "%%HTML" and more irrelevant options of the sort. My completion-at-point-functions are (python-shell-completion-at-point comint-completion-at-point t) I'm using spacemacs with the basic python layer and not too many changes (using ipython as my REPL, with python-shell-completion-native-enable set to true). I hope this might be enough information already to suggest a solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've done lots of research on this one, lots of references to mobile org which is no longer in the play store, I see orgzly but don't see an integrated sync solution. There is org-mobile-pull/push. And then there is the dropbox crew...
 TL;DR: I'm thinking of setting up a dropbox to copy my daily plan.org file to, so I can keep in check on the go. I'd need a mobile capture file as well and then I'd manually parse that into my org system at home when convenient. Intuition says doomed to fail, but I'd love to hear if anyone has settled on this kind of system, or something better that works robustly.
 (It would be nice to have more access to the rest of the org setup since the items in my plan file tend to be org links to places with notes, followups, tacking info, etc... which would be occasionally nice to have on the go but isn't part of the min feature set.)
 ​
 Thanks for any and all help or info. I know this gets asked a lot, but it seems in that deadzone of many half baked solutions that different people sometimes kinda use with apps and libraries that were tried and then have fallen out of favor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that GNU ELPA is the official GNU Emacs package repository and is the only repository enabled by default. I also understand that submitting a package to GNU ELPA is a bit of a hassle and requires an FSF copyright assignment meaning that the official repository has a limited selection of packages.
 Correct me if I'm wrong but a copyright assignment is basically transferring ownership and rights of a specific creative work or works to a third party. So in this case, the third party would be the FSF, right?
 Where as with NonGNU ELPA the FSF doesn't ask for copyright assignments for packages meaning they won't be able to go into core Emacs? NonGNU ELPA isn't enabled by default..? 
 If anyone has a simple, less confusing way of explaining this, please leave a comment. Any feedback is greatly appreciated and I thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: added missing info 
 Hi, I am trying to display the ellipsis that shows that the line is larger than the screen, but can't find any good solution. What is the name of the variable?
 So far I get this □ character at the right side of the screen for each line, showing that the line is larger than the screen. How to display a proper and nicer symbol?
 Or does it mean that there is a symbol defined, but not supported by the face? (name of the variable?)
 I looked for "ellipsis"... I thought the variable truncate-string-ellipsis was the right one... In my config "..." is defined (and it does work as org-level ellipsis...)
 I am sorry, I am not english and maybe not looking therefore for the right info using the wrong vocabulary...
 Looking for info with  describe-char  did not help...
 Thanks for your support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been having a couple of issues w/ the indentation of SRC blocks under lists (picture attached).
 1) I have an underline enabled for my begin line and an overline enabled for my end line. Under a list, these lines extend all the way across the buffer, while instead, I'd only like them to extend from the current indentation level to the right side of the buffer.
  
The org-modern-indent package does restrict the length of this line, but it adds some extra fontification to my begin/end lines that I do not want (fringe markers, and a small overbar at the beginning of the begin/end line), and I do not know how to remove these.
  
2) The content of the src is always flush left regardless of indentation level. I think this is probably related to me setting org-src-preserve-indentation to t which I did for other issues w/ indentation.
 ​
 Does anyone have any idea how to fix these issues?

Nickel instead of HCL.
Tf-Ncl enables configurations to be checked against Terraform provider-specific

can natively generate outputs as JSON, YAML or TOML; since Terraform can accept
its deployment configuration as JSON, you can straightforwardly export a Nickel
configuration, adhering to the right format, to Terraform. Tf-Ncl provides
a framework for ensuring a Nickel configuration has this specific format.
Specifically, Tf-Ncl is a tool to generate Nickel contracts that describe the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 This isn't an Emacs issue, but an intermittent problem I'm having with my home wifi. But Emacs has provided the latest clue.
 I was trying to update my packages via M-x package-display-packages. This brings up the list of packages as expected, but when I try to 'update all' via 'U', I get the message "waiting for refresh to finish". Only it didn't, after many minutes, when it usually takes a few seconds.
 This lead to many rabbit holes, until I discovered that the problem happens on my home wifi network, but if I switch to my cellular network (via a phone hotspot), the problem disappears - I can refresh my package list almost instantly.
 This makes me suspect other issues with services hanging when on my home network (but not on my cell data) may be related. 
 So: how does Emacs connect to elpa/melpa/etc? I'm hoping understanding this better might help me resolve my network issues.
 Other observations:
  
while the package update hung, I could still load webpages, including those for the repositories I use (elpa, melpa)
 
using curl -I to connect to the repositories also worked, even while I couldn't refresh the package list.
 
I build Emacs from source, and the problem existed on the previous build yesterday (which was several months old), and the latest build from sources pulled last night.
 
 As I said, not an Emacs issue, but maybe Emacs not being able to contact the repositories is a clue to the network issue?
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks,

 I'm finally taking the plunge and switching fully from Windows to Linux. Getting vterm on Windows was too involved to make me switch from my dedicated terminal emulator, but the process seems much more doable on Linux, so I've been considering it.
 However, I've also seen people praise Eat, but it seems like less people are familiar with it. And so I got curious whether people who have used both have a strong preference.
 If so, would you mind sharing a little about why you find one more appealing/ergonomic or why it may be more efficient/powerful than the other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some years ago, I wrote myself a tool to download financial transactions from my bank and put them into a ledger journal. I found that manually entering the transaction with the hledger interface was too tedious for me.
 The tool uses the german FinTS standard, so the number of supported banks is limited.
 I've now released a new version that is mainly written in Haskell instead of Python. I did that because I noticed that I am much more likely to work on Haskell projects in my free time, simply because it is more fun for me.
 Unfortunately, this complicated the setup process somewhat, as one can no longer just run pip install fints2ledger. I would love to improve this in the future but don't really know a better way.
 Code feedback is also appreciated, especially from the perspective of people not too familiar with Haskell.

 Does anyone has an idea what this could be? The file file.py is open in a buffer and I'm working on it.
 I know about auto-save (#file#) and backup files (file~). But what is .#file about? And why is it symlinked to a server-xyz-thing. Never seen a symlink like this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a tool to organize my life and take notes for undergrad engineering studies — which is exactly what org-mode is perfect for. I would prefer to use Neovim instead though. 
 I feel like emacs seems like a walled garden — where I’ll start to feel like everything I do on a computer needs to be done in emacs, as opposed to using a variety of different purpose-built tools together for task management and note taking.
 I could just use: - Markdown and LaTeX plus vimwiki to take notes - Task- and time-warrior for an agenda and to-do list - Ledger for financial management - Various shell or Python scripts to tie things together
 I’ve seen that people switch to emacs entirely for org-mode, however, and I can’t shake the feeling that I should maybe switch over.
 Edit: I definitely used “walled garden” the wrong way here; I meant that I might feel like I have to use emacs to do everything instead of having more flexibility to use other software. I see what y’all mean though, I don’t have to use it for everything if I don’t want.

 How do I resolve this error?
 I created the calendar.org file in the relevant ~/Dropbox/org section of my config so I think it is something to do with /tmp permissions?
 The programs will allow me to sync both my Google and my Etesyc Contacts and Calendars. Etesync also needs Etesync-Dav installed on the desktop but that is well explained on Github.
 Basically I have Google Calendar because of my iTalki lesson appointments and Airline Flight bookings which automagically appear there. Etesync is for anything else as I want to reduce my dependence on Google.
 ID properties created in file "/tmp/khalel-capture-NajqkZ-tmp.org" Wrote /tmp/khalel-capture-NajqkZ-tmp.ics Buffer calendar.org modified; kill anyway? (y or n) y org-back-to-heading: Directory / write-protected 
 There is no information in the buffer Khalel Errors.

 The thing is THIS code worked for my teacher, but as for me it doesn't! so it made a change about how declare and i can't do it right. this is making me difficult to practice for the test.
 I tried to undo, but I closed VSC before, thinking that it'll undo itself. however it didn't and I can't undo it anymore.
 I tried to reinstall VSC... but as you can see, it didn't helped neither. all the config stay there.
 what can I do now?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working with python lately, and on a few occasions I evaluate variables that end up producing a ton of output (e.g. dumping 1,000 filepaths).
 In my terminal, the output finishes in less than 1 second. In emacs it makes the editor unusable for about 10-20 seconds.
 So far I've tried enabling global-so-long-mode and disabling font locking in the inferior python buffer, which are the solutions I found online, but that is still resulting in unusable performance.
 Has anyone solved this? Two potential solutions I thought of would be either to find a way to truncate output and creating a command to expand it when needed, or to find a way to connect to a remote python repl running in another terminal tab, but I'm not sure how to do either of those.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have all my config in a single giant org mode file. This file produces three others when tangled, init.el, early-init.el and a custom theme for my colorscheme. Problem is, whenever I make a change in the org file, and tangle the changes, the git repo for my dotfiles now sees two different files being modified (obviously) with the same changes. It makes it really cumbersome to do proper commits, since if I did many changes and I'd like to do various commits for each of them, I have to add not only the changes in the org file, but also hunt down the same modifications in the init and early-init files (mostly init tho).
 I recently tried to fix this by dropping all of the init.el contents into some other file, call it "real-init.el". Then, I would have a very minimal init.el that would check if init and early-init exist, and if they don't, it would tangle the org file and restart emacs. I would just keep track of the org file and the minimal init file in the git repo, and since the init file is very minimal and wouldn't change very often, it would be a fine compromise.
 For some odd reason, while the files did get tangled, emacs would just restart indefinitely. It opened, then closed, then opened, then closed. I had to force kill it.
 Has anyone else faced this problem? How did you solve it?

Here is my code:

 Try opening ipython notebook in vscode. Then try to open ipython notebook via emacs.
 Vscode takes you directly to the rendered buffer ready to edit in less than a second.
 Emacs won't work and won't tell you how to fix it. You go search for a package - you find ein. You get it installed, you get jupyter package install. Turns out it was the wrong package, so now you get the correct jupyter notebook pacakge installed. It turns out that ein now needs you to separately start the server, open the server, switch to the file that you ALREADY HAD OPENED and then switch to that buffer. It opens five other buffers in the meantime, three of them cluttering your workspace.
 It also crashed twice while getting there...
 I don't doubt that it has some great features going (extensibility, minimalism), but for the love of emperor don't be an idiot and create sane defaults!
 This is the time where you can't pretend anymore and have to admit that vscode extension just did it plain better...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been learning about tagless final. I prepared a simple usecase to just create user in a repository. I started with example based tests and also tried with property based testing. Had some doubts and got it clarified in stackoverflow. My intention was to have a defined set of rules for the UserAlgebra. Since the interpreters are expected to follow the same rules, it would be easier to develop. Usually, I start with an InmemoryInterpreter implementation. Later another interpreter would be implemented for the real persistence based repository. 
 Slowly, I got pulled in cats-laws && disciple with scalacheck until I ran into a considerably long phase that I dont understand why the compilation fails. 
 Here is the snippet. https://scastie.scala-lang.org/itsnashter/HxcapljGSZylOtLyssJbLg/2. Can experts take a look to help me understand the following? 
  
What is the general convention to test the tagless final algebraic resources? I dont want to use unsaferunSync() even in tests. 
 Is having laws for repositories like "create and get" ( & rest like mentioned in scastie) really needed ? The Laws look like they were meant for structures like Monad. 
 Cats laws seem interesting but there is not much to understand for a beginner like me. Are there any blogs?

 My tex output is:

 since, captionpos=b is adding itself at last, its overriding my value captionpos=t. I looked into ox-latex and I found this:
 `(("captionpos" ,(if caption-above-p "t" "b"))). 
 I do not understand caption-above-p, how is it assigned?
 How can I stop adding captionpos=b or make it =t?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-refile to navigate and file things all the time. While it is functional, I have long craved something a little more flexible.
 So I've written a package that allows you to programmatically set composable shortcuts for org-refile.
 https://github.com/thread314/org-navigator
 It allows the user to set prefix shortcut keys to various actions (refile to, go-to, clock in to etc), and combine these with suffix keys that define the target for the desired action.
 So for example, typing C-c fa might file the current subtree to the subtree set to "a", whereas C-c ia would instead jump to that subtree and open it in an indirect buffer.
 It also allows the user to define the destination suffix keys by setting a property on the target subtree itself from within the org-mode file.
 I'm not a programmer so always very open to any feedback or suggestions.

 I have decided to extract my Haskell snippets for LuaSnip into a plugin: haskell-snippets.nvim.
 For those who don't know LuaSnip, here's an introduction. If you have nvim-treesitter and the parser for Haskell installed, and if you use haskell-language-server, some snippets will be enhanced (e.g. qualified imports and module names).
 I've only recently migrated to LuaSnip, and I expect to add more snippets that leverage tree-sitter and the LSP client in the future (probably also for Nix).

Maybe I should articulate the dream I have for my zettelkasting. "I want it to support my writing." Is this clear enough? Should I rearticulate it more concretely? What does support mean if I break it down as my stated goal?
Of course, that means that I have to start writing. Does journaling count? Part of how I've procrastinated writing is trying to automate my irregular blog posting. I've spent too much time exploring other alternatives. Automating the publishing of a post is difficult or impossible with my web host, Squarespace.
Here is a fine example of 'Task Switching as opposed to Flow,' my most recent note. I should take my advice and start and see what develops.
I've been wrestling with Python. I am learning new skills like the application of decorators, building modules, and profiling.
I'm currently reading:
Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī and Gafori, Haleh Liza. Gold, Simon & Schuster. 2022.
Ackerman, Diane. The planets: a cosmic pastoral: [poems], 1976.
Cohen, Gerald and Cunningham, Donald H.. Creating technical manuals: a step-by-step approach to writing user-friendly instructions, HarperVia. 1984.


Faulkner, Grant. The art of brevity: crafting the very short story, Prometheus Books. 2023.



I've told you about my week, now it's your turn to tell me about yours.

make a quick introduction to fs2.Pipe notion;
 discuss possibilities and limitations of turning error-flow into explicit pipeline;
 highlight some non-obvious aspects of offset commitment (especially when we distribute offsets over multiple streams);
 show Weaver suite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent quite a lot of time in LISP-land over the last few years and have internalized and begun to rely on a lot of nifty paredit features, for example slurping and barfing.
 When writing and editing, for example, JavaScript or C++ code I end up situations where I instinctively try to slurp identifiers with, obviously, no success.
 Even though there are relatively few cases where this would make sense in non-sexp code, there are the cases of the misplaced parens, for example.. given the code:
 some_nifty_function_call(my_sweet_sweet_variable, another_splendid_variable, awesomest_variable_of_them_all); 
 If I decide that I want to wrap one of these arguments in a function, I'd place the cursor before the argument and enter the function name followed by a left-paren, the mode will be kind and automatically insert a closing paren and I end up with the following, with the cursor inside the parens of `awesomify`
 some_nifty_function_call(my_sweet_sweet_variable, awesomify()another_splendid_variable, awesomest_variable_of_them_all); 
 This is where I'd like to do the equivalent of a slurp, effectively moving that closing paren to the end of the next expression - after ànother_splendid_variable`, but before the comma.
 ​
 I figure I can't be the first one to experience the want for something like this. Does it exist? If not, does anyone have a good idea how to implement a minor mode for this?
 It doesn't have to be 100% fool-proof for my needs, and I figure it wouldn't be too hard to just make a dumb language-agnostic implementation for the exact example above. But I'd also like it to be DWIM:y enough and handle more complex expressions, in which case the mode would somehow need to hook into the syntax model of the language.
 Discuss! Or.. fight! Or insult me. I'm thankful for basically any thoughts on the matter that could move me in the right direction.

 Apparently the problem due to SimplifedSubsumption and there are two work around. Add an explict type signature or turn on DeepSubsumption. What is still strange in that the problem only occurs with ghci, so I suppose there is a third workaround somewhere having to do with ghci "defaulting" things. 
 Original
 I'm trying to migrate my project to a new version of GHC and encounter the following problem (see my previous post). I narrowed it down to the following
 authFA :: AuthPlugin App authFA = AuthPlugin "fa" dispatch loginWidget where dispatch = \_ _ -> postLoginR >>= sendResponse 
 Doesn't compile , if replace dispatch with its body
 authFA :: AuthPlugin App
 authFA = AuthPlugin "fa" (_ _ -> postLoginR >>= sendResponse) loginWidget
 This compiles. I believe this as to do with type defaulting rules but the original code compiled fine with GHC 8.10 but not with GHC 9.2.5.
 Any ideal ?
 Update
 Here is the error  /home/max/devel/mae/Fames/src/Foundation.hs:378:26: error: • Couldn't match type: m0 b0 with: forall (m :: * -> *).

Essentially the terminal modes are extremely slow when I first start them after starting Emacs. Similarly commands using the (shell-command) function take a long time, and often X applications like Firefox start very slowly.
 I've tried making a custom build of Emacs (people say they had problems with the package on the Void repo) but the problem persists.
 I don't have this problem when I run the same config on Arch or Nixos, so I suspect it might be something to do with Void.
 Any other Void users have this problem too?

 I read the TUTORIAL which helped me to understand basics of emacs. I installed evil-mode(because i am a nevom user and i cannot live without vim bindings).
 But i am trying to create a setup that will help me, create a workflow that i can use as my second brain. I use zettelkasten system for writing notes.
 Are there any packages that use for note taking other then the org-mode.
 Also suggest packages to improve the UI of org files. Like heading symbols, themes, etc.
 Any useful resources on how to use emacs to take notes(Mainly blogs i don't like videos).

I want to start a digital Zettelkasten. 
But software like Obsidian, The Archive only work with keyboard input. I tryed to workaround a little bit:
downside is, i can not update, annotate or work later with the note. annotator in obsidian is pretty bad with pdfs. so the only solution would be to again start the process and update the file in notabillity reupload etc etc etc… terrible workflow.
excalidraw is also pretty bad, compared to notability and goodnotes. not a real option.
is there anyone with the same problem? someone who likes handwritten notes, but dont want to start an analog zettelkasten. the missing search function is real.
i would use notability, but i can not connect and link the notes.
im thankfull for every idea.

 Is there any possibilties to get lsp support and anaconda support while editing remote files on hpc (sun grid engine) and send code lines for python, R or other interpreted languages like I could do in other IDE but there remotely ?
 I thought about install emacs remotely and use tmux session with multiple emacs open, but I am not sure it would be easy (no sudo privileges).
 Also, I am not sure if this is the best set up for working with emacs on hpc.
 PS: I am using Doom emacs

 This is my very first post in Emacs community. I am following System Crafters video and wanted to see how would one go about creating multiple projectile projects in its config. Mine currently only shows a single project. I don't know how Emacs recognizes project directories:
 (use-package projectile
 :diminish projectile-mode
 :config (projectile-mode)
 :custom ((projectile-completion-system 'ivy))
 :bind-keymap
 ("C-c p" . projectile-command-map)
 :init
 (when (file-directory-p "~/Projects")
 (setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/Projects")))
 (setq projectile-switch-project-action #'projectile-dired))
 How to include manual npm projects or git repositories in here ?

 It's a story worth sharing with my colleages—a testament to the significance of investing in robust base operational systems built on cloud native and open-source solutions.
 🆕 🆕 🆕
 Considering the current landscape in the market and the growing prominence of ML/NLT/Embedding generation (much more in the Search playground) and the associated cost in large and sometimes inappropriate voluminous training processes, we have a unique opportunity to leverage these advancements to add value to our products without the need for additional investments in specialised and custom solutions.
 This video and the way we operate our data processes holds true now more than ever.
 Ramiro and Daniel, our presence on that stage was truly massive, let's continue pushing boundaries and seizing these opportunities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Really weird problem here. I'm writing my thesis in org-mode. All has been well (after some tweaking) so far, but I have an issue where starting a new section title with the word "Discussion" turns the word red and into a different font, and it shows up in a different font in my Table of Contents. Adding a letter or taking one away fixes it. Not capitalizing it fixes it. Writing "Conclusion and Discussion" fixes it but "Discussion and Conclusions" does not. Only the word Discussion turns red and changes fonts. I have no idea where to begin troubleshooting this :) Anyone have any ideas?
 EDIT: the tex export shows the line \section{{\bfseries\sffamily Discussion} and Conclusions} where the section header is. So something in org thinks I want the word Discussion to automatically change font family for some godforsaken reason. At least I can fix it there for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Before I try to roll my own, as I have not been able to find a package for this: is there a way to auto insert matching braces context at end braces in programming mode please? As overlay is best for me, but as text could work too. 
 Example.
 If( my condition ) {
 // Some code
 } // my condition <= this is inserted as overlay

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I recently installed Emacs 29 with native comp and ImageMagick flags on my system. However, Homebrew also installed a bunch of formulas related to ImageMagick that I believe I will never use. As a result, my brew list looks messy and cluttered.
 I would like to know if there's a way to uninstall ImageMagick and all the formulas that were installed alongside it?
 (Note: I'm on MacOS and I use emacs-plus to install emacs)
 Any guidance on how to achieve this would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you in advance!

Have added it to path but when I start emacs, there is no change to it at all. I am guessing emacs is not picking up the correct init file but I am not sure why.
 Info about my system: Running Arch, I have XDG_CONFIG_DIR set so instead of doom install installing it to the normal ~/.emacs.d/ and ~/.doom.d directories, the things are installed under .config/emacs and .config/doom directories. Reading up the doc it says emacs respects the XDG spec.
 I tried loading the init file under ~/.config/doom/ manually by using emacs -q --load but no change there as well.
 Any help would be great

I have packages installed for scala which includes lsp-mode, which depends on markdown-mode 2.3 and I have obsidian which depends on markdown-mode 2.5. Somehow this was satisfied before I deleted markdown-mode.
 I want to modify markdown-mode, so I'm using source from git and now either lsp-mode or obsidian-mode complains depending on which version of markdown-mode I have.
 How can I fix that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am wholly unsurprised that Harold Innis (1894-1952) maintained a card index (zettelkasten) through his research life, but I am pleased to have found that his literary estate has done some work on it and published it as The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis (University of Toronto Press, 1980). The introduction seems to have some fascinating material on the form and structure as well as decisions on how they decided to present and publish it.
For those unaware of his work, primarily as a political economist, he wrote extensively on media and communication theory including the influential works Empire and Communications (1950) and The Bias of Communication (1951). 
While I appreciate the published book nature of the work, it would be quite something to have it excerpted back down to index card form as a piece of material culture to purchase and play around with. Perhaps something in honor of the coming 75th anniversary of his passing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a long time, I didn't annotate my reading materials because I preferred reading on my tablet instead of my computer. And I never found a good app to use on my Android tablet either. And of course, without proper conversion to org-mode, all of those notes seemed useless.
 Then I discovered org-noter. I was excited but couldn't use it. The automatic window handling was frustrating, and I couldn't invest the time to fix it. Recently, I needed to take notes from multiple books, so I tried org-noter again, but I still can't find the best workflow.
 My initial issue was with the way how org-noter creates a "special" layout with a dedicated window. It sometimes even creates another frame - which I especially hate, even setting org-noter-always-create-frame to nil still occasionally creates a frame. I guess not a huge deal, I can live with that.
 After taking some notes, I noticed they were out of sync the next day. I tried to fix each note's page number manually - :NOTER_PAGE: prop, but it would randomly change the page numbers in other notes. Yes, I would open a page in pdf-tools, then I call org-noter-sync-current-page-or-chapter to check if the note and the page numbers match and fix them (when needed). But it also would change page numbers in some other notes. I can't figure out why. Clearly, either I'm doing something wrong, or I need to set some vars or it's just a bad combination of things, versions of pdf-tools, poppler, Emacs, etc. on my machine causing these issues. Maybe (like so many things) it just never properly worked on Mac?
 I want this tool to work, but I am struggling to find a workflow that fits. If my notes are consistently out of sync, I can't see the point of using org-noter. Can someone please advise me on their workflow, tips, and configuration?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are glad to announce streamly 0.9.0 release. streamly-0.9.0 and streamly-core-0.1.0 have been available on Hackage for some time now, you can find reference documentation and some guides on https://streamly.composewell.com as well. The website also has functionality to search across multiple streamly packages.
 This release did a major revamp of the API to make it easier to comprehend and less error prone to use. Now there is a single "Stream" type instead of the polymorphic "IsStream" type class. There are explicit concurrency combinators to enable concurrent behavior on the same type instead of using different types for that purpose.
 Dependency on GHC rewrite rules has been removed for more robust behavior and better programmer control, though it required splitting the stream type into the default direct-style type "Stream" and the CPS type "StreamK".
 The package has been split into two, streamly-core intends to depend only on boot libraries (currently has some more deps due to backward compatibility), streamly provides higher level functionality like concurrency.
 Parser functionality has been released. Parsers fuse with streams and are compatible with folds i.e. parsers are folds with more power.
 See the following docs for more details:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rustic defines its own mode but I don't want to use their functions (rustic-compile and rustic-recompile). I tried to wrap compile in my own function (after I've exported rustic-compilation-mode):
 (defun my/compile (command &optional comint) (let ((compilation-mode rustic-compilation-mode)) (compile command comint))) 
 (consider that I've put interactive where needed etc).
 The function works but the mode is compilation-mode, not rustic-compilation-mode. If I M-x rustic-compilation-mode inside this buffer the proper mode is loaded and I can navigate through errors.
 Is there a way to change the major mode of a compilation buffer without having to set it manually after the compilation has ended?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Im a haskell beginner and as of now just coding some really basic stuff and trying to develop a familiarity with the language. So I wanted to write the haskell equivalent of the intentionally wrongly written fibonnaci code below and I realised I just probably...can't?
 void fib (int a, int b, int n) {
 if( n <= 0) return;
 if(b <= 0 ){
 printf("%d ", a);
 printf("%d ", b + 1);
 fib (a, b + 1, n-2);
 } 
 //bruh block
 int c = a + b;
 printf("%d ", c);
 fib (b, c, n - 1 );
 } 
 int main( ) {
 fib( 0, 0, 5); 
 }
 in this code, i've intentionally left the bruh block of code independent of the block above,i.e., not bind it to the previous if block using an else and that obviosuly produces a output different from the expected fibonacci one. I tried building the haskell equiavlent using guards and if-else-thens and in the process i realised there's probably no way to build a freely floating independent block of code in a function that has other conditionals in haskell???....Or is there a way to do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved to eglot and so far so good, the only thing a bit annoying is when doing a eglot-rename it doesn't show the symbol about to be renamed in the initial input. 
 Usually when I do a rename is not to type a complete new symbol but to actually tweak the name, so currently have to do a bunch of M-/ to get it and then tweak it...
 Maybe that's not the behavior people expect and rather have a blank initial input ?
 It's easy to override the function directly:
 (defun eglot-rename (newname) "Rename the current symbol to NEWNAME." (interactive (list (read-from-minibuffer (format "Rename `%s' to: " (or (thing-at-point 'symbol t) "unknown symbol")) (or (thing-at-point 'symbol t) "") nil nil nil (symbol-name (symbol-at-point))))) (eglot--server-capable-or-lose :renameProvider) (eglot--apply-workspace-edit (jsonrpc-request (eglot--current-server-or-lose) :textDocument/rename `(,@(eglot--TextDocumentPositionParams) :newName ,newname)) current-prefix-arg)) 
 wandering if there is a better way to do this (with advice?) than overriding ?
 maybe i should just ask it nicely to the eglot maintainer?

that begets composable software which can be reasoned about and avails

Haskell, OCaml and Rust. However, it would be remiss of us to snub
languages that don’t enforce the same disciplines, but are nonetheless
popular choices in industry. Ivory towers are lonely places, after all.
Last time I wrote about how we can use Python’s1

 Can we do the same with emacs? Even if it has a bunch of limits in what we can use, it would be nice to be able to use at least some of emacs stuff (in the very least the keybindings) when you have to use something else for emacs.
 For instance, I would absolutely love if I could use emacs in the backend when I'm working in collaborative Google Docs.
 Is that possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been using Scala on the backend for a many years and like many of us, I use Future for concurrency.
 But, I'm trying to understand why would I use Future in ScalaJS (just started learning) with JS being single threaded.
 One use-case I found is:
 I wrote a test website in ScalaJS with two links using ScalaTags. Each link/page randomly does a heavy computation and then renders a simple but very long HTML. I want to display a spinner when I click on either of the hyperlinks, until the computation ends and the dom is rendered. Without Future, on clicking either of the hyperlinks the page takes a while to update the dom, it kinda halts the browser, and then it renders my big azz ScalaTags HTML. The spinner does not get displayed (I toggle between display = none & display = block).
 But, when I set the dom to display the spinner in a Future, and then call the render function in another Future for the page clicked using QueueExecutionContext, now, I can see the spinner. 
 Kinda weird! JS is still single threaded so why would the use of Future result in different behavior?
 Does this also mean that I should be using Future whenever I'm updating the dom?

 I started to use lxc container for development (to avoid the lot of development library on my host computer.).
 I use it with vscode + remote plugin but sometimes it is freezing / slowing.
 The lxc is running on my laptop so network is not problem.
 I can use console editor inside in the container but with vscode remote seemed okay and very easy setup at the first time.
 I found this slowness when I use git operations, the type info and intellisense working well.
 I was surprised because it is a POC not a big project.
 What is you experience with this configuration ?

 ```haskell type EditedString = [EditedChar]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! 
 I'm having a problem in installing the ess-18.10.2 in the emacs-28.2. The problem is related to 
 "Wrong number of arguments: (3 . 4), 2"
 and occur in a lot of files. I traced to ess-r-package.el, in the line:
 (define-obsolete-function-alias 'ess-r-devtools-check-package-buildwin 'ess-r-devtools-check-with-winbuilder)
 This seems to be only code line with the problem. The other occurencies of the error are in the "require" statement. 
 The funniest thing is that the problem occurs only in my laptop. I have a desktop with exactly the same software configuration (ess-18.10.2, emacs-28.2, OpenSuse Tumbleweed) and this pack works fine. (in both cases I downloaded the tar.gz from emacs and compiled manualy).
 Someone has any ideia of why it happens? I really can't remenber if I made something different in the desktop installation.

 The idea is to enable use of org to create one-off/standalone html pages - removing the headache of managing 2 files. Just work with a single html file that you can throw onto a static file server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would greatly appreciate help with trying to install htmlz-mode package - it's a very simple package - single htmlz.el file that needs to be evaluated. That's it.
 For some reason this (Doom) emacs macro (using straight.el) won't work:
 (package! htmlz-mode :recipe (:host github :repo "0xekez/htmlz-mode")) 
 What does straight.el needs to simply evaluate this damn file on start or when entering "web-mode"?
 I imagine that the author of htmlz-mode haven't looked for a way to "properly" package it, but given how complex looking for information on emacs is I can't blame him. 
 Is there no way to simply collect tracelog from emacs? Why are there no warnings that it didn't evaluate the file? Where would you look for logs? How do you troubleshoot emacs? How do you call this thing "self-documenting" when I experienced the worst documentation out of any open-source tools out there on that user-scale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For me, one thing that is important other than the technical aspects (and Emacs most certainly helps me to work faster and more efficiently on my novels) is the question of self-motivation. To help me with that, I have made a little function that shows me the current progress I have made today when I press s-#.
 It even has a "graphical" aspect to it, the color changes bit by bit from gray to green, and it simulates a "bar" that fills up. The number of characters/pages needed for my daily goal to be done is in a variable I have in my init file.
 I am sorry I opened a new thread, I wanted to post this in the thread "Emacs for literature", but I don't know how to post a picture in an answer to thread. So here is the Minibuffer a few times during the day, to give you some idea of what I mean.
 It is in German, the translation would be: 92.791 characters, 30 pages, equals 56 percent [today new: 0/2] Current page 93 percent, scene 1 page, chapter 1 page.
 In the modeline, I also show what "page" I am on. It just divides the length of the Buffer through the average number of characters on a standard page (3000 characters). Must seem like a very un-Emacsy way of doing things to you, but it helps me to get a feeling of getting things done somehow. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I sometimes write markdown documents in which I want to quickly add some python code. Maybe this is the readme of a python project on github, or its a quick blog post that will be processed by my static site generator.
 I know there are million projects along these lines, and many very complex, but I threw my own dead simple one: markdown-notebook minor mode.
  
Load the code.
 Open a markdown document and load the minor mode.
 If you press C-c b it creates a markdown python code block.
 If you press C-c C-c inside a python code block, it sends it to a python shell, and pastes the results back into a blank code block right after the python code block.
 C-c C-x will restart the shell, in case you want to start fresh.
  
Please free to use. Any simple improvements are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am seeing this weird behaviour. When I start emacs, internal links work as expected: I have a table of contents (created with org-toc) and I can jump from the entry in the TOC to the headline with simply typing return.
 But at some point (and I have been unable to find out what triggers it) when typing return on an internal link I am asked to provide a tags table: "Visit tags table (defaults TAGs): ...". 
  
Does anybody know if visiting a tags table is expected org behaviour? I traced the code to the best of my abilities and I see that org-link-open is being executed.
 Does anybody know how to inhibit the "visit tags table" behaviour?
  
I do have many packages installed (emacs-prelude) so it might be something else. I tried to use the debugger, but failed to understand how to use it.
 thank you in advance for any hints/ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is a continuation of the discussion found here: [Link to Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/13guvo3/should_i_go_with_scala_or/), and I would like to share my conclusions.
 ​
 I am thrilled to embark on a journey with Scala and dedicate a significant amount of time to writing projects, starting with my personal blog/portfolio. However, I do have a couple of questions that I hope you can help me with:
 ​
 1) What technology stack should I consider?
 ​
 After careful consideration, I have made the decision to use tapir and http4s for my projects. However, I am currently torn between ZIO and Cats. Personally, I am leaning towards ZIO as it seems to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly effect system. Nevertheless, I am aware that Typelevel/Cats is more widely adopted in the industry. Could you please advise me on which one has a greater demand in the market?
 ​
 2) Is it necessary for newcomers to have knowledge of Akka?
 ​
 I have some experience with GraphQL and have been exposed to RPC-like concepts and classic MVC patterns. However, I feel hesitant about diving into actors, as they remind me of the unnecessary complexity I encountered with redux-saga. Would it be mandatory for me to learn Akka for my first few projects, or can I initially focus on other aspects?
 ​
 Thank you in advance for your assistance!
 ​
 P.S. #1 I would greatly appreciate it if you could also recommend any helpful materials such as books or project ideas to aid me on this journey.
 ​
 P.S. #2 As a more serious and long-term project idea, I am considering developing a "Job Aggregator (Scraper)" or a "Job Board." Personally, I lean towards the first variant as it aligns more with data processing, and I am eager to spend time designing a system that can scrape data in real-time and notify subscribers. 
 P.S. #3 I would like to extend my appreciation to ChatGPT for its assistance in crafting this beautifully written post in English.

 I'm writing a compiler, and have the following definitions in order to get a more organized pattern matching when I'm messing with the AST: haskell data WYType = WYNum | WYArray | WYString | WYBool data Token = Identifier | WYType | ... 
 What confuses me is that the compiler doesn't recognize WYNum/WYArray/WYString/WYBool as a Token. I feel like mathematically is possible. Shouldn't a | (b | c) | d = a | b | c | d?
 Thank you for your answer!
 Edit: for more context, this is the error message I get from my Alex file:  • Couldn't match type ‘WYType’ with ‘Token’ Expected: String -> Token Actual: String -> WYType • In the expression: alex_action_7 In the expression: (1, alex_action_7) In the second argument of ‘array’, namely ‘[(5, alex_action_3), (4, alex_action_4), (3, alex_action_5), (2, alex_action_6), ....]’  The corresponding section of Lexer.x: ``` tokens: :- <0>「([\s\「]+)」 { \s -> Identifier s } <0> 數 { _ -> WYNum }

 When writing my diary, I find myself regularly using C-l in order to recenter-top-bottom until the current line vertically centered.
 Then, I realized that Id love to have a solution that is less manual than automatic.
 I know about centered-cursor-mode, and while it is already better than the default behavior, I am still not satisfied: I literally want point to stay -- in a particular buffer -- in the vertical center, at all times.
 Do you happen to know a package that achieves this?
 Thanks, have a good day!

 Long time lurking, finally brave enough to ask for help.
 I recently switch from ivy to vertico, corfu and embark. 
 I'm having issue when corfu-popupinfo kicks in during the autocomplete. It get stuck and can't move to the next option. I have searched if someone had the similar bug in github for vertico and corfu but looks like no one is mentioning about. I think at this point, I started to believe something is wrong with my configuration or it's just doesn't work well together. Here a screenshot showing. Also I'm sharing my configuration and the error message I'm getting from corfu. I'm using only lsp-mode without the lsp-ui.
 any tips to help where this bug can come from?

 Thank you in advance for all the advice's and help.

 or when the AST consists of multiple types:
 data Expression m = Apply m (AST m) (AST m) | Var m Symbol | ... data TopLevel m = Assign m Symbol (Expression m) | ... 
 But this gets harder and more annoying if I want to have a different type of metadata for the different types in the AST. I then heard about the Fix type constructor:
 data Fix f = Fix (f (Fix f))

 My problem is that I need a working tex environment for exporting this.
 Is there a way to directly express math in MathML in an org file avoiding the use of tex?
 ​
 btw: This is not about pro and cons of *tex. I'm a heavy *tex user and know how it works and how to set it up.

 Is there a fonction in emacs to find in the config where a variable is set?
 When I call  describe-char I can read the name of the font and a parameter with the value 19... I see this value nowhere in my config, and I have difficulties following the logic between font size (ex: 12), or points (120)...
 I do not know how to describe it better...
 Any help is welcome, how to set once and for all the right size for my font.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a quick blog post about the elfeed-webkit package I just published to MELPA.
 It provides a lightweight integration of the elfeed web feed reader with Emacs' support for embedding webkit widgets, and allows for browsing a feed entry's source link right within Emacs, without leaving the context of elfeed.
 Webkit rendering can be toggled on/off manually, or automatically based on an entry’s tags.
 This might be interesting for you if you use elfeed and are subscribed to feeds that don't render well as text.

I have been customizing my workspace to create a more aesthetically pleasing environment, although I must admit that I am not an expert in elisp programming, so my attempts have been relatively simple.
 ​
 I am generally satisfied with the outcome so far. However, I would greatly appreciate it if those of you who also use Emacs for writing literature could share any additional tools or suggestions that have proven useful in your own writing processes. I believe that your insights could potentially benefit me as well. Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I'm really excited to announce the release of Ogma 1.0.9!
 Ogma is a NASA tool that facilitates integrating runtime monitors or runtime verification applications into other systems.
 Use cases supported by Ogma include producing Robot Operating System (ROS 2) packages [3], NASA Core Flight System (cFS) applications [4], and components for FPrime [1] (the software framework used for the Mars Helicopter), as well as generating monitors from requirements specified in natural language [5]. Ogma is also one of the solutions recommended for monitoring in Space ROS applications [2].
 Ogma leverages existing Haskell work, like the Copilot language [6] (also funded by NASA) and BNFC [7].
 For more details, including videos of monitors being generated and flown in simulators, see: http…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year, Google did not select Haskell as an open-source project for the Google Summer of Code program. In line with tradition, the Haskell community stepped up, with multiple individuals, companies, and non-profit organizations funding nine significant open-source contributions to the Haskell ecosystem:
  
Cabal file support for HLS
 Implement Resolution Methods in HLS
 Goto Definition for Third-Party Libraries in HLS
 Teaching Weeder About Type Class Instances
 Standardize GHC’s Error Dump in JSON Format
 Maximally Decoupling Haddock and GHC
 Representing Pattern
 Improving Calligraphy
 Structured Errors and Error Codes for cabal-install
  
For more details about the accepted projects, the participants, and the mentors, see this announcement: https://summer.haskell.org/news/2023-05-14-summer-of-haskell-2023-project-selections.html
 We would like to thank the sponsors who made this possible:

 Is there some on the go way I can have it accept C-c C-x as the whole input? there are other cases like this one and I'd like to know the way to have it accept the shorter key combinations defined when I'm finished typing them

 My website as a writer is (after the old typo3-setup has broken down) is also done via Emacs, it is all static HTML now, but better for viewing with the smartphone than my old page. I tangle the website out of Orgmode into HTML files. If you are interested, the english version, which is somewhat outdated though, is www.titusmueller.de/index_en.html. I need to get the German content translated and bring it up to date.
 Then there is the Agenda for my reading tour through many cities, my e-mails via Mu4e ... You get it: I am hooked. Thank you for making it such a joy even for a non-programmer to use Emacs!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How has your week been? What are your plans for the coming week? Tell us about the state of your zettelkasting journey.
I'll start.
I'm reading some lightweight new books:
Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī and Gafori, Haleh Liza. Gold, Simon and Schuster. 2022.
Faulkner, Grant. The art of brevity: crafting the very short story, Prometheus Books. 2023.
I've released the pressure cooker steam that I put myself in by taking a graduate-level writing seminar on food. since the class ended, the floodgates burst, doubling the time spent in the garden of my ZK. Some of my structure and sub-hub notes have gotten large, and I find I'm looking at refactoring them. Thinking about structure note size, I'm not sure smaller is better in the age of fast search. I have a bunch of search tools/extensions that help focus link creation and finding stuff for the output side of zettelkasting. A technique I'm stealing from someone on the forums is when placing a note on a structure note to look closer at links already on the structure note for link candidates. The fact that they are placed in a particular section of a structure note means the note is surrounded by ideas that relate. Or maybe I can figure out a way to link to a section of structure notes. (I already have a method of linking to a specific place in a note but don't use it in this workflow.)
Python programming continues to be exciting, and having a large collection of notes as a playground has been fruitful. I've expanded "Idea Explorer" to provide more information about a note thread. It now has tabs for the "Tag Map" and a tab with all the one-sentence summaries of the notes listed together.  I continue to work with trending for my ZK dashboard. Part of which is behind "My Ten-day Zettel Production."
Once again, writing precedes my thinking.

 I want to version control my bookmarks to share them between machines, but these extra marks that get created automatically seem to get in the way.
 Do y'alls know of a way to disable the creation of those bookmarks without altering the source, and/or can you think of a workaround for version controlling and sharing bookmarks between my machines without constantly having changes to the file present that I did not make?
 Any help appreciated.

I do tech su pport work during the day and happen to reverse colors on an image and got a very pleasing set of colors and decided to try it on EXWM (Emacs window manager).

 Feel free to let me know whether it's good, bad or indifferent. I'm pretty thick skinned :) .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy! I'm running Gentoo and using EXWM.
 I'm trying to set it up so that startx launches emacsclient. I start the server with emacs --daemon --eval "(require 'exwm)" -f exwm-enable (I've tried running this both from TTY and from within .xinitrc). In .xinitrc I start emacsclient with exec emacsclient -c.
 Once I've started the server and run startx, Emacs works perfectly the first time. But if I exit with C-x C-C (or switch to TTY2 and killall emacsclient) and run startx a second time, Emacs freezes and the frame shows up smaller and in the top-left corner of the screen.
 If it helps here's my .xinitrc:
 # Disable access control for the current user xhost +SI:localuser:$USER # Make Java applications aware this is a non-reparenting window manager export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 # Set default cursor xsetroot -cursor_name XC_crosshair # Set keyboard repeat rate xset r rate 200 60 # Start emacs # emacs --daemon --eval "(require 'exwm)" -f exwm-enable exec emacsclient -c 
 And here's the relevant bit of my init.el:
 (use-package exwm :straight t :config (require 'exwm-config) (setq exwm-workspace-number 1) (exwm-enable)) 
 Also there's this in early-init.el that might be relevant but I doubt it:
 (push '(fullscreen . maximized) initial-frame-alist) (push '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t) default-frame-alist) (setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t frame-resize-pixelwise t) 
 How can I find out what's causing the issue? I just can't understand why it works the first time but not the second time.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Fellow Scala Enthusiasts!
 I'm pleased to announce that Tyrian 0.7.0 has just been released. 🚀
 Tyrian is a Scala 3, Elm-like frontend web framework for Scala.js, and I'm particularly excited about this release. There's only a few real changes in it, but they're good ones! ...some of them are also quite fundamental to how Tyrian works, so please report any problems or come and say hello on our Discord server if anything looks odd: https://discord.gg/b5CD47g 😅
 First, one of the most requested features has finally been implemented: Tyrian now has frontend routing as standard. You can now make multi-page SPA's with minimal fuss.
 Second, Tyrian's tiny runtime has been completely rewritten, resulting in super snappy start up times, and better performance than ever thanks to the wizards behind Cats Effect 3.5. (Please don't forget that Tyrian works equally well with both CE and ZIO.)
 Third, another oft requested feature: You can now start Tyrian apps just by embedding the script in a page. No more launching via JavaScript if you don't want to!
 Finally, a small but welcome usability improvement around our CSS property naming. Properties are now available in `camelCase` as well as their original `kebab-case`.
 Full details are in the release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.7.0
 All examples and Tyrian's g8 template have been brought up to date, the docs site will probably lag behind a bit as usual. 😬
 I hope you give it a go, and don't be shy about hoping onto our Discord server if you need any help ...or even if you just fancy chatting about frontend dev, game dev, or to generally heap praise on Scala.js.
 Happy routing!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I regularly swap between Windows, macOS, and Linux computers. Sometimes I have internet, sometimes I'm on a vpn that blocks package downloads, and sometimes I don't have access to internet at all. This makes it difficult to download and install the Emacs packages I normally use through melpa and elpa. I'd like to version control my .emacs.d for when I have internet access, and keep it on a thumbdrive when I don't. 
 But I'm not entirely sure what the best way to go about this is portably. Do I just 
  
Create a folder called offline-packages
 Download each package I use from git
 add this line to my .emacs.d? (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/offline-packages/my_package")
  
(require 'my_package)
 Can I just do git add elpaand just commit the entire folder under version control? If I do this on my Windows PC will the .elc files work on my macOS or Linux pc? If not how do I handle the recompilation? How have other people approached this?

 A while ago I posted https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12jfsan/fixed_window_layout_like_cedet/ and got a reference to https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager - and that has been life-changing. I've ordered the book purely to appreciate the insights in this article. I'm of course convinced I will find a lot of good stuff in it, but I haven't even began digging into it. But I did create the following little snippet that has in the last 24h already improved my quality of life significantly:
 ``` (setq switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t) ;; Introduce a bottom side window that catches ;; compilations, deadgreps etc. (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist '("\deadgrep.\|\Compilation\" (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . bottom) (slot . 0) (window-parameters (no-delete-other-windows . t))))
 (defun deets/side-window-resize (enlarge) (let ((bottom-windows (window-at-side-list (window-normalize-frame nil) 'bottom))) (dolist (window bottom-windows) (when (symbolp (window-parameter window 'window-side)) (if enlarge (window-resize window (window-height window)) (window-resize window (- (/ (window-height window) 2))))))))
 (defun deets/side-window-toggle (arg) (interactive "P") (cond ((null arg) (window-toggle-side-windows)) ((listp arg) (deets/side-window-resize t)) ((symbolp arg) (deets/side-window-resize nil))))
 ;; Remove our side-windows (global-set-key (read-kbd-macro "C-x w") 'deets/side-window-toggle) ```
 When compiling or grepping, the window is placed a the bottom. I can quickly enlarge/shrink the window, and toggle it. Very happy with this, and I'm already thinking about further improvements.

 Is that possible (guess yes; make your own Prelude)?
 Then I would want to use this to generate code (doesn’t have to be readable; it won’t be human edited or read); instead of writing a lexer, parser etc; is there an easier way, considering the language already has everything available? So I am looking for something I can execute (I can with the first question of this post) and, when happy, generate code. 
 Anything easier/already done besides figuring out how to use the GHC internals to do this? 
 (Usual apologies if this has been asked and answered before, but the search gave me only DSLs and such)

On the one hand, technical progress is fantastic: there is IDE support in form of HLS, GHC is having regular and frequent releases and great features (JS and WASM backends). On the other hand, job offers are still scarse (seem even scarsier then they used to be) and we see some companies move away from Haskell (Facebook / Meta?)
 So what is your opinion? Is it winning of losing? And if it is losing the to what language? And why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seeing people publishing their Tic Tac Toe games here, I decided to show my fully functional, documented, local 3D chess game written in Haskell. A quick glance at the software stack and features:
  
Vulkan for the rendering.
 The package effectful to keep the game logic independent from orthogonal aspects like logging, window handling, memory management and debugging.
 The package apecs for the overall game architecture.
 GLTF for importing 3D models from Blender.
 Features include moving pieces, 3D rotation, smooth zooming, a skybox, lighting and jumping knights :-)
  
As you will recognize in the linked repository, the chess game is merely a running example of a larger endeavour: while implementing the game, I separated the reusable parts of the game into separate packages. The result of this process is hagato (Haskell Gamedev Toolkit), a collection of loosely coupled, easily combinable sub-libraries which can be used or ignored as desired, thus allowing developers to select features and technologies at will while remaining in full control of the overall game architecture. It makes use of the new cabal feature which allows one to put multiple public libraries into a single package.
 I published some additional packages on Hackage while implementing the game: apecs-effectful for integrating apecs into effectul, resource-effectful for managing resources in effectful, and chessica which implements the pure chess logic used in the 3D game.
 However, the chess game was just a testbed, to be honest. My overall goal is to use hagato now to implement the game I wanted to build in the first place, but I cannot share any details yet.

 My background is not in OOP but the thing I have been struggling most with in Haskell is file organization (It just never feels "right" to me, not sure why) and just difficulties getting around the tooling but now that I got it set up it just works most of the time.
 Anyways, interested in feedback from experienced Haskell users, especially in code organization and formatting or just general coding tips.
 Also as an added question, after implementing the tree building/traversing functions in Skynet.hs using (un)foldTree instead of explicit recursion, to me atleast, the code doesn't seem that much clearer, I'm wondering if that's something that will come with experience or if manual recursion is just the way to go sometimes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im working through the paper "Structured Handling of Scoped Effects'' and on page 13 they introduce an inference rule that looks a lot like Coyoneda, but with two continuations. Translating it into code:
 ​
 data DoubleCoyo : (Type -> Type) -> (Type -> Type) -> Type -> Type
 In : g n -> (n -> p x) -> (x -> p a) -> DoubleCoyo g p a
 ​
 They then say that this is equivalent to a left kan extension Lan Id (Comp g p) (p a), and since Lan Id = Coyoneda, this is the same thing as Coyoneda (Comp g p) (p a).
 ​
 However, I am stuck trying to show that the two types are equivalent. Am I on the right track, or did I make a mistake somewhere?

 (I actually really love getting rid of IO! Really neat ideas)
 I can use `State` successfully within a basic function, but should I try to compose various separate random functions together and `runState` over them? Seems tricky at first glance.
 Perhaps I need to look harder at this: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/State#Handling_Combined_States
 I have also `split` generators, so each function is called with its own, which works, but doesn't look the most elegant.

Coming from an OOP background i tend to seperate code in individual files, ive seen others putting the whole program in the Main.hs or at least a huge chunk of it. Which approach is preferred, or does it even matter?
 
I represented a valid move with the "Move" datatype. What bugs me is that i can still generate a "Move" with invalid coordinates, is there a way to make it stricter / safer. I think about F# having private constructors etc.

 I have two questions about thunks. Please help me understand them.
 Question 1: The wikibook says that: in this expression
  let z = (length [1..5], reverse "olleh") in ... 
 z is a thunk.
 But stackoverflow says that the outermost layer of z is the data constructor (,), which is in WHNF, thus z is not a thunk.
 So which one is right? I tried this on GHCi
 ghci> z = (length [1..5], reverse "olleh") ghci> :sprint z z = (_,_) 
 and see that z is not a thunk, only its components are.
 Question 2: Both 1 and "hello" are in normal form, thus are not thunks. So why does GHCi show that "hello" is a thunk?
 ghci> x = 1::Int ghci> :sprint x x = 1 ghci> x = "hello"::String ghci> :sprint x x = _ 
 Edit: I posted the same questions on StackOverflow

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm struggling with finding a way to combine pipes in such a way that I can send a stream of 't' in, have it passed to all the pipes, and get a stream of 't' out. I'm guessing the type would look something like this
  foo :: Traversable f => f (Pipe a b m r) -> Pipe a b m (f r) 
 the resulting stream should have values from all combined pipes interleaved, i.e. something like this
  main :: IO () main = do P.runEffect $ numberProd >-> (foo [evens, double]) >-> P.print where numberProd = P.each [1 .. 5] double = P.map (* 2) evens = P.filter even 
 should produce this (without the added explanation)
  2 -- double of 1 2 -- evens of 2 4 -- double of 2 6 -- double of 3 4 -- evens of 4 8 -- double of 4 10 -- double of 5 
 Am I missing some way of doing this that's so obvious that no one has written about it?
 Oh, yes, I am aware of conduit's support for this but at this point the project is fairly heavily invested in pipes and switching to conduit isn't really an option.

 https://www.youtube.com/live/1vd9mvH8Bos?feature=share
 In this episode, we will discuss in what way parameterised datatypes are injective and type families are not. For this episode, we assume familiarity with Haskell fundamentals, in particular datatypes. Knowledge of type families is certainly helpful, but not required.
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks. The playlist containing all episodes so far is here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7

 traverse when specialized to monads looks like:
 traverse :: (Traversable t, Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> t a -> m (t b) 
 which is the shape of an endofunctor in the Kleisli category. The corresponding functor laws are:
 traverse pure = pure -- purity law traverse (f <=< g) = traverse f <=< traverse g 
 The paper An Investigation of the Laws of Traversals proves the latter law, but only when the monad is commutative, which suggests that this doesn't hold in general. What would a counterexample look like? Does this mean that the type of mapM is very slightly too general?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to figure out whether it's possible to tell from Haddock documentation whether a given data type is a distinct type with the same name or a re-export of a type defined in another module.
 For example, if I search for IO on Hoogle, the result for data IO a points to many different modules, e.g. the Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude module from the hedgehog package: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog-1.2/docs/Hedgehog-Internal-Prelude.html#t:IO. As far as I can see, there is no way to tell, from the docs alone, that this type is a re-export of Prelude.IO. However, this must be the case since the following code typechecks:
 import qualified Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude test1 :: Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude.IO () test1 = (pure () :: Prelude.IO ()) 
 If I, on the other hand, search for e.g. Query on Hoogle, I will get lots of data types called Query that are not the same, ie. not re-exports. For example:
  
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple-0.6.5/docs/Database-PostgreSQL-Simple.html#t:Query
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws-0.24/docs/Aws-DynamoDb-Commands-Query.html#t:Query
  
Which means that the following will not typecheck:
 import qualified Aws.DynamoDb.Commands.Query import qualified Database.PostgreSQL.Simple test2 :: Aws.DynamoDb.Commands.Query.Query test2 = (undefined :: Database.PostgreSQL.Simple.Query) 
 Hence my question: given the Haddocks for two datatypes with the same name, is there a way to tell if they're the same?

 The repo tries to be a "challenge" for people learning haskell, rather than a tutorial. You are given a series of function to implement and you end up with a working snake game. Then you are introduce to monad via refactors instead of via example.
 I think is a good resource since it goes directly into building something instead of teaching recursion, pattern matching, etc... Which is a much funnier approach, although the challengers are expected to learn that by themself (via other resources). The README.md has more information about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The standard way to map Haskell to category theory is to use the category Hask, where objects represent types, and arrows represent functions between types. It's known that this is an approximation - for example, it ignores bottom values. But I want to talk about another way in which it fails to match the Haskell type system.
 In Hask, we can talk about an object representing Int, one representing Bool, one representing (Int, Bool), one representing Either Int Bool, etc.
 However, this only handles the structural types in Haskell. Haskell allows you to declare nominal types, e.g. newtype Age = Age Int or newtype Count = Count Int. Now those two types should be represented by distinct objects in Hask. There is, of course, an isomorphism between them.
 But how would one distinguish which one is which?
 If we want to represent all possible Haskell types, should we have an infinite number of objects structurally equivalent to Int, because each one could represent a different possible name?
 One approach would be to define Haskell types as pairs of objects from Hask with objects in a separate category of names.
 But then how would you enforce the fact that one name can be used for at most one type? You could end up with the same name being paired with two different types.
