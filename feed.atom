        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: any quick and dirty way to say… convert this org buffer with eMacs faces into the html equivalent? (In terms of look). I’m tempted to just share screenshots but would lose links and people would think me mad.
 —-
 I’m exporting to html because I’ve failed at setting up pdf export on my Mac. I use code blocks to get something like a breakout text block… but all white space seems to get eaten and it just gets very “wall of text”. And the text blocks are full screen/scale but the text wraps at my eMacs width. 
 Can I get it to just export a look like the eMacs faces? Italics get broken in quote boxes. Newlines without an extra line get wrapped into a wall. Etc etc, I’m sure we’re all familiar with this. 
 I eventually want to learn how to format correctly and get it all working… but I don’t want to delay sharing my doc for the week that will probably take me to figure out. ;)
 Any pro tips appreciated. Is html just the wrong way and I need to bite the LaTex bullet? It was crazy how funky it seemed to be to get it going. 
 Thanks.

 After testing, it seem that i can chain multiple binary operations, and each time it will use both the output of the chain, and the initial input:
  (+)=<<(+)=<<(*)=<<(*5) $ 2 == 2*5*2+2+2 == 24 
 What kind of monad is used here? The only types involved are Nums and afaik Num isnt a monad. I suspect that its the ((->) a) monad but i dont know its name so i cant research it, plus no links in Control.Monad for it.

 It is my first post here, and i want to introduce the devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge project! This feature brings auto-completion to your Emacs setup within development containers, using the powerful lsp-bridge.
 What is it?
 The devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge automates the setup of language servers supported by lsp-bridge inside your devcontainers. By using Nix packages, it ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, making it easier than ever to get started with Emacs and language servers in a containerized development environment.
 Key Features:
  
Auto-completion in devcontainer
 Support for multiple languages
  
Check out the repository for more details.

 My talk "Functional Programming: Failed Successfully" from LambdaConf 2024 is now published online.
 This is my attempt to understand why functional languages are not popular despite their excellence. The talk's other title is "Haskell Superiority Paradox."
 Beware, the talk is spicy and, I hope, thought-provoking.
 I'll be happy to have a productive discussion on the subject!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep noticing that some Emacs users seem to not be familiar with keyboard macros, and even those that are familiar with them aren't always familiar with the fact that there's a counter facility associated with them so you can do things like giving every #define in a block of C code a distinct associated value or what have you in a few keystrokes.
 Multiple cursors are sometimes the right tool, but some of the things people do with them are probably better done with keyboard macros. If you don't know about them, you should.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs Community!,
 I've going around my head and investigating as for a way to finally implement all my email setup in Emacs, which is:
  
3 Gmail accounts that I can implement with .authinfo and application passwords
 
2 Gmail account that I can't
 
1 Microsoft Exchange account where I can't use app passwords and, when configuring davmail, I needed authorization (actually asking for it)
 
 My problem is the latter two, where in case I got lucky and manage to fight my case and get my app password in the Exchange one, I would still will be unable to use the 2 Gmail accounts that don't have application passwords activated.
 I could configure Davmail for exchange, now, not sure about the other two gmail accounts... I think davmail only works for Microsoft.
 Is there, perhaps something like davmail that I can use across all of my accounts?, since application passwords aren't considered secure, in the case these are eliminated, I wouldn't want my accounts to stop working...
 How complicated would be to implement this? (elisp developer), is there perhaps a protocol that is not implemented in Emacs?, something like ouath2 which I think has a package. How technically complicated is this and, how much would it take?. Or is there perhaps, a different more updated way that I don't know of?.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running EMACS 29.3, I get the messaage package cl is deprecated on start (been going on for a while--it was deprecated in 28 or 27, IIRC). I believe this is associated with the [simplenote2](https://github.com/alpha22jp/simplenote2.el) package. I use one of it's functions (creating a note), I get the message format: Symbol’s function definition is void: math-fixnum. If I create a note on the browser, I can edit it in EMACS to my heart's content. I just can't make a new one. 
 My suspicion, as I said, is it's related to the cl package. I was going to try to dig into the code to see if there is a fix, but I wanted to ask before digging into that: is there some standard fix/best practice/shim that can be applied to fix this?

This was one of the first notes I ever wrote but the more i learn about zettelkasten the more I think that this is more of a mini-essay. I think many of my notes are more of mini-essays rather than individual zettels. If so, how would I turn this into individual zettels? How do I know how far to break something down and when does it get too much? Sometimes I feel like every sentence could be turned into a zettel.
Side note: I use links instead of tags for categorization - not sure if I love this method but it's whats been working for a bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work on a lot of parallel features in the same very large git repo, so I've been making use of git worktrees and treating each worktree as a separate projectile project. Usually the worktree is named ~/reponame/feature_im_working_on. 
 However, because the repo is so big, and because the build cache takes so long to initialize, I don't want to create a new worktree every time I start a new feature. mv'ing the worktree unfortunately breaks the build cache, for reasons of stupid build system that's out of my control. What I'd really like to do is have ~/reponame.real/a ~/reponame.real/b ... and symlink those to ~/reponame/my_feature. But projectile and project.el notice that its a symlink and name the project ~/reponame.real/a. I've been looking for a way to prevent this behavior, and just use the symlink as the project name, and I haven't found it. Has anyone else done something like this with their workflow? Or do I need to hack the project.el source and add this?

 One area I wish could be smarter is completions. I use corfu and cape; I would love it if Eshell were super smart about completing commands, sub-commands (like with git), control flags, etc. I have some configuration around this, but I'm not happy with it.
 How do you configure Eshell and your completion-at-point mechanisms to be as smart as possible?

 I am trying to establish a LaTeX workflow, and ideally would like to use pdf-tools (or something similar) because well, everything works that way all within emacs. However, the rendered pdf doesn't feel quite snappy and fast as a standard pdf viewer like Zathura or even firefox's pdf viewer.
 Is this a known issue with pdf-tools, or is there something that I would have to change in the config to make it work seamlessly with emacs and auctex?

I found a discussion on stackoverflow suggesting a config like this: (setq url-proxy-services '(("no_proxy" . "\(localhost\|10.*\)") ("http" . "proxy.com:8080") ("https" . "proxy.com:8080")))
 (setq url-http-proxy-basic-auth-storage (list (list "proxy.com:8080" (cons "Input your LDAP UID !" (base64-encode-string "LOGIN:PASSWORD"))))) 
 (I can find similar examples elsewhere also)
 ... the url-proxy-services seems to work, as I can see the request hit the proxy. But the url-http-proxy-basic-auth-storage seems to not work, as the proxy logs include a DENY with "Authentication required", and when I look at the traffic with the request to the proxy, it doesn't include any authentication.
 Has anyone had any success getting this working? It's emacs 27.2 on OpenSuSE.
 Thanks

 Think of "region/State" field, they are of course fixed (at least in the short term) but different on each country. I can see two different ways to handle it:
  
Manually change the file with the enum, simple
 
Keep them on a database and use set to generate the code automatically, cam make people nervous with this self-modifying code thing
 
 What would be the preferred approach in Scala?

I want to try out Ecukes, but it doesn't seem too compatible with Borg. Whenever I try to run 'eask install-deps', it gives the error "Package not installable 'ecukes'; make sure the package archive (source) is included". I managed to trace the error to the following function in eask in lisp/_prepare.el:
 (defun eask-package-installable-p (pkg) "Return non-nil if package (PKG) is installable." (assq (eask-intern pkg) package-archive-contents)) 
 Since I use Borg, I don't appear to be setting the variable package-archive-contents. What would be the right way to go about solving this issue?

 Edit for more info:
 I did think it was coming from the company package so I have it commented out and still the completions continue to show.

 Apparently M-x company-mode toggles it and then the suggestions go away, but that only seems like a local change. Could you help me understand what is happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've finished reading Learn You a Haskell and I'm currently following a tutorial on monad transformers I found online. The exercise is implementing MaybeT.
 The author makes MaybeT an instance of MonadTrans as follows:
 instance MonadTrans MaybeT where lift = MaybeT . (liftM Just) 
 I'm a little confused initially, so I open my code editor and get the type annotation for lift, which makes it clear instantly: it takes a value in the base monad to produce a value in the transformed monad, with that same base and Maybe as a precursor.
 So I implement it on my own:
 lift :: (Monad m) => m a -> MaybeT m a lift x = MaybeT $ do x' <- x return $ Just x' 
 My code editor suggests a refactoring here, which I end up agreeing with:
 lift x = MaybeT $ do Just <$> x 
 And then the thought occurs to me that lift could be implemented generally, like so:
 lift x = MonadT $ do return <$> x 
 But then the author asks, as an exercise: why is it that the lift function has to be defined separately for each monad, whereas liftM can be defined in a universal way?
 So I know I must've gotten something wrong somewhere here; but where exactly? Is it that using return makes sense in the context of Maybe, but it doesn't in some other monad?

 Hello, I recently wanted to try emacs, last night it worked great, but today I got the blue screen out of nowhere and when I wanted to open emacs again I got that, should I reinstall it or what is the problem? By the way, I'm super new, beyond reading the documentation they recommend

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The math symbols are (way) smaller than the default font.
 Recently, I've been fighting with org-pretty-entities to customize some behaviors. My latest endeavor is "why the UTF-8 character for math symbol are so small compared to the default font?". FYI, this happens in org-mode and LaTeX-mode.
 When looking into the characters itself, some clues I've gathered:
  
the faces applied are font-latex-math-face and font-latex-sedate-face. Unfortunately, changing the height in any of those cause other parts to be comically large (math-face is also applied to the rest of the math block, sedate-face is applied to any latex command like \underbar).
 
the font used to display those characters is mac-ct:-*-Apple Symbols-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 despite my default supporting it (both mono and variable pitch are nerd font).
 
 Right now I am mostly suspecting the issue is the font that is being applied, but I am not sure how to fix it. Even when using (set-face-attribute 'font-latex-math-face nil :family "NotoSans Nerd Font"), it keeps using the aforementioned font.
 Actually, the describe-char gives me the following info (some kinda of character composition? Not really that expert in Emacs):
 display: composed to form "\alpha" (see below) Composed with the following character(s) "alpha" by the rule: (?α) The component character(s) are displayed by these fonts (glyph codes): α: mac-ct:-*-Apple Symbols-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#xA1E) 
 Any help would be appreciated.

 I like to keep my non built-in package count very, very, lean. I understand that there are probably some practical benefits to using these programming language specific modes but I just don't like the idea of picking a package for every programming language, learning all the complexities of each of them, and using LSP, and using tree-sitter. It just seems like a lot.
 I also don't know how to autmatically enable LSP and tree-sitter when editing certain file types without hooking into these modes.
 I'm very new and just looking for some Emacs wisdom. Thank you.

 Currently playing with org-drill and anki-editor to get a feel for these too. Any other I should consider?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please skip this reading, it's just a message about me and Emacs.
 I was ready to write a rant.
 Then I gave up and started to breathe and think.
 I've been an Emacs user for a couple of years and have learned a lot but I'm still pretty dissatisfied.
 But dissatisfied with what? Not about Emacs. Not about the packages I use. The truth is that I'm dissatisfied with myself using Emacs, mostly because I'm lazy, that's the sad truth. Emacs is not for lazy people like me. Emacs is a demanding teacher. It requires you to be focused, focused and disciplined. So I decided to completely change my approach. I stopped compulsively trying any piece of package I found on Reddit. I decided to read and study Lisp, starting from the basics, the commands and the basic architecture.
 My frustration is driven by my ignorance. Above all.
 Emacs isn't for me when I think I can find a baked solution on satckoverflow.
 Emacs is not for me if I expect to have every package well documented in detail.
 Emacs isn't for me when I think one package can solve all my problems.
 Emacs is not for me if I think Emacs can organize chaos in my head.
 But I also found the main problem in Emacs: it causes dependency.
 Once you try it you can't stop using it, you can't stop thinking about it, you can't stop trying to find new solutions. Learning Emacs must be done in an organized and programmatic manner.
 I'm not a developer, nor a programmer, I'm mostly an aspiring programmer (I use R and a little Python), but the way Emacs forces me to stay focused on what I'm doing, to organize my notes, my documents, my GTD is something new and somehow irreplaceable.
 Thank you all. Thanks Emacs. And sorry for the unnecessary message.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I enjoy the code-writing experience Emacs and the community provides. But this is the 8th year since I joined the party and I still feel overwhelmed. Usually when I write code, random "problems" still show up here and there, even I have "solved" a lot in the past.
 By "problem", I mean issues, warnings, behaviors that don't work the way I like, configurations I have to choose and balance, even functionalities I used to know but forget their shortcuts, function names or triggers.
 If I ignore those "problems", they will just stay there and continue to popup every now and then until I upgrade the whole packages and hoping those problems get automatically solved.
 If I solve them, it usually take some time which will interrupt my normal workflow. This is annoying.
 There are two solutions I can think of:
  
Either "problems" get fewer as time goes (which is usually not the case). or
 I get control over Emacs and can solve every "problem" really quickly.
  
In terms of option 2, what can I do? Should I
  
get better at common lisp?
 read more packages' source code?
 remember more built-in elisp functions?
 write a package from start?
 just spare a fixed amount of time fixing Emacs problem every day?
  
What's your experience and solution? What's your advice to people like me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using Obsidian / VSCode for many years now, but wanted to 'get the hang of' Emacs to see why it is regarded as the most efficient way to manage code/info. The last time I used Emacs was in the 90's but I don't recall it being extra special at the time. (I probably wasn't looking at all the features though)
 I am feeling good about Emacs now - I find myself working pretty easily with it, and am finally getting the hang of some of the shortcuts (it was really difficult at the start to not C V )
 CSV editing is great - columns can be aligned easily
 Dired mode is the real bonus - apart from the initial oddness of clicking a folder and having it open in the next buffer, I am now loving it. It is really quick to jump around and edit multiple files, and the directory list itself is great to copy quickly from (making a lot of tiny CSV files). The marking of files via regexp is fantastic, and there are so many little things that make working just that bit easier.
 So, I have uninstalled VSCode and am using Emacs full time for coding now (still using Obsidian - the markdown links are a bit borked so I need to do some scripting to convert them so they work nicely)

 I installed the GUI version on windows 10 and one thing I have trouble figuring out is how to make the cursor position visible as in the lower part of this image which is taken from a screenshot of "Emacs from Scratch" 
 I would like to have something similar so I can find my position in the buffer. Unless I type something I do not know where in the line my cursor is (as in the upper part of the image)
 So far I only managed to set the hl-line-mode on so I can at least find the line I'm in, but several things I tried to put in my config that I found in various forums led me to believe that I perhaps do not know the correct terminology for this setting.
 I tried
 (setq-default cursor-type block) 
 and 
 (setq make-pointer-invisible nil) 
 and tried changing the cursor color, but it didn't make it visible. 
 Any help would be appreciated, I'm sorry for asking such a basic question but I could not figure it out with googling it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have released version 0.6.0 of Kele, the spritzy Kubernetes management package for Emacs. Changelog here.
 Note: This release bumps the minimum required version of Emacs to 29.
 This release introduces the notion of kind-specific keybindings. Some resources have special "actions" associated with them, e.g. "restarting" Deployments or getting logs from Pods. kele-resource now has a dedicated column for these keybindings that, when defined, are dynamically filled in based on the selected resource kind. For now, there is only one resource-specific keybinding—R to restart a Deployment. Try s-k deployments to check it out.
 https://preview.redd.it/5orkdwttqb5d1.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e4da9c9ea2fc30a47556085f7c23c5e7483f5c
 In addition, individual bindings within kele-resource are disabled based on your permissions for the given context/cluster. In other words, if you don't have permission to list Pods within the selected cluster, Kele will disable the l keybinding with a helpful message.
 https://preview.redd.it/jkvqq4tuqb5d1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=474adba750c5dffb6a8f58cb03566fc92ff4cbdf
 Lastly, this release fleshes out the resource listing functionality. Some highlights:
  
In addition to opening a resource from the list view (RET), you can now also delete/kill the resource at point with k;
 The list view now shows the owner resource(s) for every list item; hitting RET with your cursor over the owner cell will instead open the owning resource;
 The list view now supports listing across all namespaces.

 For more details, see the Kele documentation. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you'd like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.
 Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've noticed that recording a macro when having a special input-method enabled (say TeX) and using isearch, the macro is terminated by ringing of the bell. I've found that one of the functions called is isearch-with-input-method (isearch-x.el), and it calls exit-minibuffer; commenting out that call, even though some things behave funny, at least doesn't terminate the macro. It also works if I disable the input-method temporarily, then use isearch, and simply turn it back on if I have to input something specific to the input-method; that however rules out any searching for special characters, which isn't ideal at all. Is there a way to remedy this? It seems strange to me that one shouldn't be able to record a macro simply due to using an input method... Help greatly appreciated! I'm using Emacs 30 from homebrew-emacs-plus.

I am an early stage PhD student for computer science.
I've been using a Zettelkasten-esq system in Typst (a LaTeX alternative) to keep track of my research, coursework, and a few serious hobbies.
My current in-Zettelkasten obsessions include disparate but I-swear-they-make-sense-in-my-head subjects such as:
Vector databases and sparse graphs
Package queries and user defined functions
Matroid theory
Theory of order statistics
Whatever is going on in that feud between invasive biologists and conservation biologists
Early 20th-century Christian socialism
I am a little bit of a bat who is just passable enough at seemingly unrelated topic in databases and mathematics to eek out some papers. As a professor told me, it's easier to be first than to be the best. And, if you're not cut out for pure mathematics, just get into applied-applied-applied mathematics of computer systems!
My current Zettelkasten iteration is a bit weird; if it matures and stands the test of time, I may divulge further. Its main principle is to help me keep on chugging along and do some real work.]]></summary>

In the process, my thinking improved, but I still have a long way to go. Knowledge emerges through continuous stress testing of ideas, mostly through writing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently done some work where I wrote a parallel test loop for QuickCheck (QC). I did this in collaboration with Koen Claessen, Nicholas Smallbone, and Bo Joel Svensson.
 It is not merged in the QC repository yet, and it will take some time (it is a significant change). I must have implemented five different versions along the way, and what is there now is a mix of all of them. I am happy with the end result, but had to rush a bit in the end to reach a deadline. There is some wonky code lingering around my fork that will go away in due time.
 If you would like to try it out before it gets merged, I have written up some instructions in the link below. I have also included some of my results as well as links to both the code and paper :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This isn't Scala specific, but I thought it would be a good place to ask.
 I'm working on forming my thoughts on error handling, and I'm looking for any existing writing that I should be aware of. Specifically I'm looking for anything that compares and contrasts control flow driven (ie. exceptions) and data driven (unions, tuples, monads of various flavors, etc.) error handling.
 Other free food for thought: It seems like as of 2.13 the Scala ecosystem had pretty well settled into data driven error handling of various flavors. With Scala 3 there are new options on the horizon for control flow based error handling. Interestingly things like boundary break syntax for error handling in ox looks very much like monadless syntax, but works totally different under the hood.
 disclaimer: when I say control flow driven error handling, I don't mean the anti-pattern of intentionally using exceptions for control flow

 Generally I have been enjoying reflex but this time I've stuck with what seems like a very simple feature for days! Hopefully someone can help.
 Let's say I have a dynamic list of some value and a delay Dynamic t [(Text, NominalDiffTime)]
 I've been trying to end up with an Event t Text which would be an event stream that fires as many events as there were in the list with very limited success.
 This event stream should be triggered by another event Event t ().
 I've been trying something like
 haskell performEvent $ ffor theTriggerEvent $ \_ -> do valuesAndDelays <- sample . current $ valuesWithDelays ... construct the event stream 
 but the problem is that I can't use delay inside Performable.
 I have a gut feeling this is some sort of a fold but I can't wrap my head around it.

Created the project folder.
 Created a python file in it (<filename>.py)
 Initialized a git repository in it and committed the above file: git init; git add .; git commit
 Added an empty ".projectile" file in the folder
 Made sure my projectile-project-search-path is set to "~/"
 Ran projectile-discover-projects-in-search-path and verified that it was able to discover other projects
 Ran projectile-add-known-project and selected the folder
  
Up to step 6, it doesn't discover the folder as a project. When I do step 7, it seems to add the project folder to the list of projects, but when I try to switch to it, it complains that the directory is not a project, and then removes it from the list.
 Here's the directory after I create it:

 ├── .projectile
 └── script.py

 It is only possible to turn off a specific set of rules by recompiling the source files with those RULES pragma commented out? Then if want to turn off rules written in the base package, is it true that I will have to hack it and recompile the base package myself? Many thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When writing elisp code and looking for a function that would do something you need, what do you use to find it, inside Emacs only (no web search)?
 Emacs has a lot of built-in documentation; it has
  
a help system,
 an info system,
 Apropos
 all code has docstrings,
 for other outside help, it has an excellent support for the man pages with: 
 man and woman
 
  
On top of that you can install other complementary packages that add more help search features such as:
  
helpful (which is excellent)
  
There's a lot of commands available with the C-h or <f1> key prefix and lots that are not bound by default.
 I documented the ones I know and created some others in my system in this PDF: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/master/doc/pdf/help.pdf
 Despite all of that, every so often, I stumble to find the name of a function that I know exists but can't remember the name. The other day I was looking for the predicate function that tells whether point was at the beginning of line; bolp.
  
I tried typing beginning and using C-M-i to complete it. That did not work.
 I typed C-u C-h d for apropos-documentation and got a long list of suggestions from which I searched for "beginning .? line" with some regexp and finally I found bolp at line 7833 of the Apropos buffer.
  
I eventually found it, but it took longer than I like. And was very tempted to search the internet or depend on a connection to the outside world (eg, IA). But there must be a better way to quickly find functions in Emacs.
 How do *you\* quickly find the functions you need *inside Emacs*?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the best way to sync installed package versions between different computers?
 I have been using use-package with :ensure t for a long time (with the default package.el as the backend). But I've read posts from experienced Emacs users suggesting to not do this. Instead, they recommend using package-install manually and then check ~/.emacs.d/elpa into their dotfiles repo, so that you sync the exact set of installed packages between computers. This is supposed to make the config more reproducible, since after a git pull every computer will have the same "Emacs state".
 This idea appeals to me, especially since I've noticed that (i) sometimes my config doesn't bootstrap correctly on new computers, (ii) sometimes package upgrades break my setup and I want an easy way to roll everything back when I need to just get work done, and (iii) I've started relying more on GitHub packages (via package-vc-install-from-checkout) and would like to avoid having to repeat this on new hosts.
 Some more concrete questions for those who follow this approach:
  
If you sync your installed packages in this way, what exactly do you sync (i.e. what's your `.gitignore`)? 
 I guess you *should* sync the `*.el` files, otherwise there's not much point.
 I guess you *shouldn't* sync the natively compiled {`*.eln`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`} files.
 But what about the byte compiled `*.elc` files? Are these portable across different operating systems, different processor architectures, different Emacs ports, and different Emacs major versions?
 
 After syncing, do you need to do anything special to make things work? 
 For example, is `package-recompile-all` required?
 
  
Or is all this a fools errand, and I should instead switch tox e.g. elpaca, straight, etc.? Since I left Spacemacs and Doom Emacs some years ago, I've mostly stuck to the default package.el when I use Emacs (I regularly use Vim as well). But I am open to other tools if they make my life significantly easier.

One of the keys to this is that I use my Zettelkasten almost every time I have to think about some of my projects.
For example, suppose I'm having trouble developing a character's personality in a fiction story. What I do is create a structural note that aims to answer the question, "What is the ideal workflow for developing the personality of a fictional character?"

But neither it, nor any of the related replace/search commands appear to be able to find them. This only happens in this pairing scenario, where there's an underscore both at the start of the first word in a sequence, and at the end of the last word. Otherwise the underscore is found by search as it should be.
 Can anyone explain what causes that?
 FWIW, the replace/search fails regardless of whether I havecase-fold-search defaulting to t or to nil (although that does affect what message I get when the replace/search fails).
 ADDED: I've just noticed that the same problem exists with all six of the formatting characters mentioned in the manual, viz.: *, /, _, =, ~, and (if I must 🤓) + . I guess that should be a clue as to what the cause is, but I don't see it yet.

I've tried a bunch of ways to do this (projectile, project.el, perspectives, beframe, tabmode) but can't seem to be able to find a setup that ticks all the boxes above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently saw a tweet featuring an upcoming improvement to Metals that would allow you to interact with code and use completion/navigation while the project is not in a compiling state.
 This is more challenging to do than it sounds, and I wrote a tiny blurb about the problem and the proposed solution.
 TL;DR The Scala team at VirtusLab is working hard on improving the experience of using Scala 3 with Metals, but I also believe this could greatly benefit IntelliJ IDEA as well.

 I am desperately trying to get doom emacs in terminal mode (emacs -nw) to have a transparent background. I have tried everything that I could think of and find as resources, but I can only get the emacs GUI to have the transparent background by following emacs wiki and setting in my doom emacs config.el:
 (set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha-background 70) (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha-background . 70)) 
 My emacs version is emacs29-pgtk. I am using the kitty terminal and have already made the terminal itself transparent.
 I would greatly appreciate any tips on how to make this work, as I have tried for a long time and have no idea why this is not working.

I couldn't get the LABEL setting for :id to do what I expected.
 Same thing with the :match setting.
  
One cool trick--add a number of rows with a :noexport: tag and put the columnview dynamic block outside of them--made reporting a bit easier as a way to avoid including headings that aren't necessary except as property containers.
 While the above's mostly a complaint, I do have a constructive question: how can we get a cookbook of working examples that show uncommon usecases (e.g. using column view as a multi-line workaround for tables)?

and that stands even more true for Python monoliths.
Python’s versatility is convenient, yet a very big gun to shoot one’s foot with.
If there’s one thing I’ve learnt over the years of building software,
it’s the importance of testing to mitigate risks and allow refactoring in the long run.
In my experience however, I’ve seen much less testing in projects than I would’ve liked.
If it can be rarely attributed to plain malevolence or stupidity,
the most recurrent reason is: it is hard and it takes too much time.
The issue is, it’s often true!
So how can we lower the barrier to make testing easier?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a way to generate a traditional "org chart" (e.g. for a company) from an Org mode file.
 So far I've tried out org-mind-map† (via graphviz). It works, but the output is more DAG-like than the kind of thing you see with a standard organizational chart††. I know that org-mind-map-engine offers some control over the format, but none of the options match what I'm looking for.
 Does anyone know if I can get what I'm after out of org-mind-map?
 Or, if not, any other Org mode-based suggestions?
 Thanks!
  
† I'm using the-ted/org-mind-map via melpa, rather than the unpackaged fork at alphapapa/org-mind-map . That's simply because although it's a fork, the latter appears to be behind the former in commits. The forked code looks to be the unmodified v0.1 of the original, whereas the original is now at v0.4. But if anyone (e.g. u/github-alphapapa himself :-) ) thinks there's more going on there, and that the fork actually is the one to use, let me know.
 †† For example, in the traditional org. chart, a parent node with multiple child nodes would connect to its children using a single line with branches off it to each child (and the parent). Something like this. By contrast, org-mind-map's DAG-style has a separate line from the parent to child for each of the children.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using emacs & org for knowledge management, and I often need to search my notes. One of the ways I do this is with +default/org-notes-search (from search.el, maybe it's a doom thing? It just wraps ripgrep on org-directory), which displays two windows; a list of results on the bottom and a preview of the currently selected result on the top window.
 I don't hard-wrap my text files; I rely on visual-line-mode instead. This makes searching kind of annoying, because I can't get the preview window (the top one) to wrap long lines. The closest I've been able to get is by doing this:
 `(add-hook 'occur-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode)`
 which sort of enables visual-line-mode in the preview window... but only sometimes, and only if I click in that window to focus its buffer. I can then go back down to the results and flip through results in the same file, but when I Get to the next file I have to refocus the results buffer again.
 Anyone have an idea of how I can get this to work seamlessly? Extra bonus points if I can enable visual-fill-column-mode too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How can I skip certain heading levels in org clock tables? I'd like to skip certain "boring" headings from clock table reports.
 I organize my projects GTD style like this:
 * Sell My Home ** Purpose / Expected Outcome - Sell my home for a lot of money ** Project Reference - Asking price :: $100 - [[https://zillow.com][Zillow]] - [[https://realtor.com][Realtor]] ** Actions *** TODO Research Home Values :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2024-06-05 Wed 09:00]--[2024-06-05 Wed 10:00] => 0:00 :END: *** TODO Create Listing :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2024-06-05 Wed 10:00]--[2024-06-05 Wed 11:00] => 0:00 :END: 
 I use clock tables like this:
 #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope file :maxlevel 4 :compact t :block today #+CAPTION: Clock summary at [2024-06-05 Wed 11:06], for Wednesday, June 05, 2024. | Headline | Time | |----------------------------+------| | *Total time* | *2:00* | |----------------------------+------| | Sell My Home | 2:00 | | \_ Actions | 2:00 | | \_ Research Home Values | 1:00 | | \_ Create Listing | 1:00 | #+END: 
 I'd like to skip the "Actions" row, like this:
 | Headline | Time | |----------------------------+------| | *Total time* | *2:00* | |----------------------------+------| | Sell My Home | 2:00 | | \_ Research Home Values | 1:00 | | \_ Create Listing | 1:00 | 
 Is it possible to either exclude certain heading levels, or (better) exclude certain headings, but still include their children? For example, exclude "** Actions" but still include its children. I see there is a matchoption, but I'm looking for an exclude option, based on the header name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am considering to give haskell a go (again). I actually wanted to earlier but got discouraged by an (at that time) very clunky tooling experience, and I also found it annoying that I had to use pragma's to for example enable exhaustive type checking (which imo always should be default). At the time I instead decided to dive into Purescript, which I have been enjoying quite a lot ever since. I have probably written somewhere around 10k lines of purescript by now. However, I feel that purescript is quite niche and has some annoying limits due to primarily running on node or in the browser. For example, I don't see myself ever doing proper parallel processing in purescript. I also feel that purescript might be more limited in context of future job opportunities. These are the reasons for which I am considering to give learning Haskell a second try.
 Much learning material seems to be targeted at OOP programmers who are new to FP. I obviously don't need the the whole FP sales pitch with my background. What I need is more something along the lines of "I am comfortable with FP, monads, type classes and monad transformers, and now I want to learn Haskell without getting bored by the learning material".
 I have read the excellent purescript book called "Functional programming made easier" https://leanpub.com/fp-made-easier. My background before Purescript has been working professionally with F# and Clojure for a few years.
 On the longer run I am considering to do some Haskell certification https://certification.serokell.io/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm currently trying to generate MkDocs from my collection of org files, to have some sort of static documentation site based off my notes.
 My approach so far has been converting org to markdown with pandoc, to then feed all markdown files to mkdocs along with some custom css.
 This seemed quite straightforward, however I soon realised there are a few caveats: - pandoc org parsing is not 100% accurate and some elements are missing (e.g.: task priorities are not parsed to their own AST element) - mkdocs extends markdown with custom syntax, this md block for instance:  ??? Drawer Lorem Ipsum  will be rendered as a collapsible drawer in the resulting html. This led me to write some custom pandoc filters, for example to convert a :NOTES: org drawer to a ??? NOTES md block.
 In all fairness, it's becoming a bit complex and there's a lot of stuff I'm not covering yet.
 So the reason for this post is to ask you for guidance about what approach to use, I see 3 options: 1. continue with the current approach of using pandoc, adding more logic/filters when needed 2. use a different, more complete, org parser and then generate mkdocs-compatible markdown myself 3. write something entirely in Elisp, similarly to projects like ox-hugo.
 I'm a bit of an Elisp newbie, so I'm not sure how feasible it is for me to tackle option 3, other than that feel free to suggest other options.
 Thank you for taking the time to read this!

 Fully specified, fully decideable schedules are appopriate when scopes and times are known. I can imagine people who have jobs that are relatively static find the features of vanilla org mode to be appropriate.
 However, for open-ended work, which is endemic to small companies in their high-growth and product development phase, these tools (and many, many others) fall down in a lot of ways. Most work is optional, even aspirational. The payoff of any piece or an ensemble of pieces is uncertain. The bandwidth is scarce and must be triaged. Managing is i…]]></summary>

 It's working pretty well with the exception of the Eldoc documentation. When I hover over something, the documentation correctly shows in the minibuffer, but when I open the Eldoc buffer with eldoc-doc-buffer, the documentation is repeated multiple times.
 I tried debugging it and found out that if I remove eglot-signature-eldoc-function from eldoc-documentation-functions, I get only one item in the Eldoc buffer. However, I don't know how to prevent Eldoc from adding this item and thus avoid the duplication in the Eldoc buffer.

 My use-case is the following: I have a video playing (web browser), and the subtitles in emacs. I can query the video for the timestamp and synchronize the subtitle to the video (moving the point to the current subtitle and potentially recentering the window).
 I want this to be done automatically until I press a key. At that point the synchronization stops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been experiencing random flickering on the pgtk build of emacs on wayland in the recent months since updating to nvidia-drivers version 535 from 525.
 I am building Emacs from source with pgtk enabled every week. And I am quite sure it is related to Nvidia because all the flickering goes away when I downgrade to nvidia-525. I am now on Nvidia 550 and the issue persists. 
 I have an RTX2060 with Gentoo.
 After some testing, I find that all OpenGL related applications especially with lower version of OpenGL like 3.x are having the same issue. I even wrote a bunch of SDL window to render simple textures to test that. All the others with vulkan does not have the same issue.
 I have messed around with Minecraft recently, and the launcher has an option of running OpenGL on Zinc, which is an OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan. If I run Minecraft with Zinc enabled, the flickering is gone.
 I believe Emacs is using OpenGL to draw on screen. Is there any workaround for me to run Emacs' OpenGL call via Zinc? Or does anyone have similar experience that have found a solution?

 pen.el was created in 2021 as an annotation tool, but I was not used it a lot at that time. Recently I picked it up and dramatically changed its usage. Now it is a complete solution of making annotations and language learning tools, right inside Emacs.
 pen relies on sqlite. All annotations are saved inside a database, which means it can be easily backup and you can read and make annotation right inside Emacs (PC/mobile) using same database.
 pen’s ideas are coming from all following great tools:
  
LingQ: Learning a language by reading
 Kindle Vocabulary Builder
 org noter
 Chatgpt
 SDCV
 go-translate
 Eudic
 蒙哥阅读器
  
and more.
 This package is mainly used along with:
  
nov-mode
 org-mode
 pdf-view-mode
 eaf-mode
  
But it is able to work with all modes in Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not sure what's happening and why, but recently I started to have this problem where Emacs just closes itself randomly while I'm working. 
 It used to happen once a day but now it crashes legit every 15 minutes. Any idea what could be the problem, or has anyone experienced something similar? 
 If I had to bet I would say it's a Fedora problem, but how to know for sure? Because these crashes seem to only happen with Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I ported org-krita and org-xournalpp with custom link. They used to be based on creating their own overlay, and in my forks they are configured with `:image-data-fun` with org-mode custom links. So I commented out their minor mode definition, as they are no longer relevent; previewing images is done with `org-display-inline-images` like all other custom links.
  
https://github.com/hermanhel/org-krita (used github because I want to pull-request)
 
https://codeberg.org/Hermanhel/org-xournalpp (don't want to create gitlab account)
 
 story: 
 I was revamping on my solution to include visual illustrations in org-mode. I passed on them 2 because they were painful to use with that custom overlay, and they make huge overlays which is hard to adjust size. I used org-excalidraw for a bit, it was great, but the export tool it used excalidraw_export does not function properly at all in my KUbuntu 24.04 environment. I see the author's demo works perfectly in macOS, so maybe it is because of different svg library(excalidraw's own svg export does not display font correctly on my machine).
 I saw excalidraw use a image-data-fun, so I played around a bit and made org-krita and org-xournalpp the same. It is kind of weird that lambda do not work when I was testing, I had to declare my own functions and use function's symbol in `:image-data-fun`.
 enjoy.

 OS: Arch linux
 JDK: 21
 What I've done so far:
  
Install coursier per the website instructions
 update the JDK to version 21 of OpenJdk
 Install Metals extension with vs code.
 Create a new app using sbt sbt new scala/scala3.g8
 Open with vs code and import the sbt build for metals.
 Run metals doctor and get a bunch of warnings about version mismatches.
  
It seems like the current version of coursier ships with JDK 11 and I though it would be a good idea to update a more recent one. Seems like Metals supports up to version 21, but 17 is the current default.
 So, long story short, the environment is out of sorts. What would you all do in this situation?
 Edit: Specific error messages below
 Code navigation will not work for 3 build targets in this workspace due to mis-configuration. Select 'More information' to learn how to fix this problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon, Emacsen
 I don't honestly use tree-sitter much -- my main language is well handled by the venerable vhdl-mode. However I had been using it many moons ago for a Typst document. I had all the libraries obtained, and snagged typst-ts-mode for the part where it does things with the tree-sitter output.
 I distinctly remember there being syntax coloring when I was using it before.
 I recently opened the same Typst document, and it's not doing anything with syntax highlighting. I dutifully updated Typst, the tree-sitter libraries, and typst-ts-mode and still no joy. I can turn on treesit-explore-mode and see tree-sitter correctly interpreting the code. So far, so good I guess. That's the main engine. (Also (treesit-language-available-p 'typst) returns true, so I think I'm pretty solidly in the tree-sitter active camp.)
 However I have been reading Mickey Peterson's article on tree-sitter (https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter), trying to make sure there wasn't some step I left out along the way. Also the tree-sitter Emacs documentation at https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/syntax-highlighting/. This last claims that there exists a function tree-sitter-hl-mode. I tried M-x tree-sitter- and about this time, completion offers up nothing. There are no tree-sitter functions! This is Emacs 29 and it was built with tree-sitter support so I would imagine that the basic functions would be there.
 Any ideas what went pear-shaped here? I started a ticket at typst-ts-mode's repo but I am not entirely sure if the issue is that I forgot to set something up, or if it is indeed that package.
 Thanks! I think I will remove the call to use typst-ts-mode and see if there's any difference in behavior. I THINK there's a slight snag when that buffer loads, but I'm not 100% certain just yet. (EDIT: doesn't appear to be a delay so it must have been my imagination)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm talking about the prompt that opens when you run M-x eww RET to type the URL, or when you use eglot-rename and it asks the new symbol name.
 Is there a package that allows me to replace that prompt with a temporary buffer?
 What I need: - To be able to insert text efficiently with all the "normal" buffer bindings instead of the limited buffer
 What I would love: - A buffer that pops up in a posframe - When I save and quit, it has the same effect as pressing RET in the prompt - When I quit without saving it has the same effect as C-g

That said, I am trying (purely for education) to explore this problem where my functions can return values while also modifying a key data structure, so I think using the State monad makes a lot of sense. At the same time, there is a function that might or might not successfully return a value, and if it fails to return a value, then I don't want my State to be changed. From what I have read, this could be handled with a MaybeT wrapped around the State monad, but I'm struggling to work this out in my brain, and I can't find any straightforward examples.

 The initialization of the frame that displays the terminals is easy enough using something like
  (dolist (buf (buffer-list)) (with-current-buffer buf (when (eq major-mode 'term-mode) (tab-bar-new-tab) (switch-to-buffer buf)))) 
 but then such a frame should keep track of terminal buffers being killed/created and add corresponding tabs. I can probably hack my way with appropriate hooks, but I wanted to know if there's a package that already does this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a NES emulator in Haskell, and I'm getting pretty inconsistent frame rates.
 They are consistently inconsistent in the sense that I'll have a frame run at a rate of 130 FPS, and the next one at a rate of 30 FPS, followed by another frame at 130 and so on. 
 If I run with +RTS - p -RTS, I can get a center cost that tells me which functions take the longest.
 But I'm not interested in the mean cost of each function, but rather in the variance.
 Is there any way to profile this automatically? I would really prefer not to wrap every function I have in a timer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that Emacs is more than an editor. You can spend an entire life learning Emacs. It never stops and it adapts to anything you want to do with a computer. 
 Using one, or several terminal emulator buffers inside Emacs can be extremely useful. What's you use case?
 As for me, one thing I do often is create a keyboard macro that gathers information from one or several shell or REPL output to place it inside text file either for documentation or to create unit-test code. And sometimes I write some elisp code to do some of that. Being able to interact with an Erlang and Python REPL for example, with the OS shell of a local or remote computer and Emacs Lisp together (including with eshell) greatly enhance what can be done quickly. 
 Not all Emacs terminal emulators are made equal. I wrote a comparison table for the ones I know and what I have tested. That might be useful for others. It's here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/master/doc/pdf/shells-comparison.pdf 
  
This is part of a larger set, the index is accessible in the top-left corner. Use a browser that can render PDF directly instead of downloading the PDF for a better experience.
  
What are *your* use cases?

 You can upgrade from GNU ELPA or install with M-x package-install RET org RET
 Please, also re-install all the Org-related packages - some of the changes require re-compiling packages that use Org mode APIs.
 Release notes: https://orgmode.org/Changes.html
 Announcement: https://list.orgmode.org/87jzj7adfd.fsf@localhost/T/#u
 If you enjoy using Org, please consider supporting contributors via https://liberapay.com/org-mode/. Donations do help a lot.
 Some highlights of user-facing additions
  
Org mode supports drag-and-drop and pasting images/files from clipboard (pasting from clipboard requires Emacs >=29)
 Thanks to Visuwesh for contributing these features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi all, 
 I am trying to learn Lisp, and since most of the tutorials seem to use Emacs, I am learning Emacs at the same time. 
 Now, I have a 60% keyboard, and I was wondering whether I should move to a full-sized keyboard to use Emacs more easily?
 for example, the very first example in the Portacle tutorial requires typing ~ three times, which on a 60% keyboard is Fn-S-~ , so it is a bit of gymnastics. (Portacle is a packaged installation of Common Lisp with Emacs) 
 Thank you for any advice

 There are different oppinions about solving algorithmic problems during hiring process. Not a big fan of it, but I still see that employers include coding tasks in such platforms. My recently I was asked to pass task in HackerRank and Codility. For another interview Codewars was recommended for preparation. I quite enjoyed https://www.codewars.com I must say (not a promotion btw just sharing personal impression), however it does not have a lot of Scala tasks.
 I assume 90% of that market is occupied by Leetcode, but still curious whether you are practising solving such small coding tasks and if so, on which platform? 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I would appreciate some thoughts/opinions on this. 
 Preface: In my day to day work I am Java Dev using hibernate. I resented it at first (too much magic), but it kind of grew on me and I recently started to really appreciate it mainly in the following sense: When modeling my domain I can go full java-first, completely ignoring that my model is backed by a RDBMS, that is - code my model as if there were no DB, slap the right annotations on it, (make a few compromises here and there) and get going. It even forward engineers the ddl for me.
 So in scala world it seems to me that the accepted approach is to separate the model from the persistent model? 
 Here is why I think that: - the libraries I found map rows to case classes, but usually no built in support for inheritance, sealed trait hierachies, ... - no support for one to many aggregation - bad support for nested case class, especially if they occur multiple times
 Here is a sample of how I would model an invoice if there were no database
 scala case class Invoice( ... senderName: String, senderAddress: Address, // general purpose case class to not repeat myself recipientName: String, recipientAddress: Address, status: Status, // some sealed trait with cases like e.g. case Sent(when: LocalDate) positions: List[InvoicePosition] ... ) 
 I feel like I either - have to compromise A LOT in modeling my domain if I want to close to zero hassle with db libs out there - have my db access case classes be separated from the domain and do alot of mapping/transforming
 Any experiences, or hints? how do you handle this in your apps

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I'm not too experienced with Emacs-fu, but I think I might be developing a case of Emacs pinky. I've tried making some changes—I've adopted evil, god-mode, and I'm planning to buy a split keyboard this year.
 The main issue I'm facing is inefficient mini-buffer navigation. For instance, I use WSL, so there are a lot of nested folders I have to navigate through, which means I end up hitting TAB a lot, and it's painful.
 My current workflow looks something like this: C-x C-f ~/fol TAB (folder1) TAB nes er2 TAB (nested-folder2), and so on.
 For completion, I used Helm in the past. I use Vertico now because I believe I'll be able to master it sooner than Helm. I feel it's more predictable with more information available online on how to set it up. However, I liked how Helm handles completion with the RET flow instead of TAB unlike Vertico which opens Dired on RET. 
 Now, I have a few questions:
  
Is there a better way to navigate mini-buffer completions? 
 Is there a better way to navigate through nested folders efficiently?
 
 How can I mimic Helm-like completion behavior in Vertico?
 How do I turn off TAB completion so that I don't keep clicking out of habit, like I do with Capslock?
  
Thanks!

 Additionally, totally disabling standard org fontification (bold, italics, underline) in example blocks would be helpful, if anyone has any insight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm experimenting with composition-function-tableto add effects to certain sequences of characters, like shoving to characters closer together. I noticed that characters with descenders that extend below the baseline like "g", "j", and "y" can cause the line height to increase when rendered via `font-shape-string` via a custom entry in `composition-function-table`. This happens for example with the "M+ Code Latin 50" font, but only at certain font heights.
 The simplest reproduction is this:
 (set-char-table-range composition-function-table t '(["g" 0 font-shape-gstring])) 
 That causes this artifact, where typing a "g" causes the next line to shift downwards:
 https://cdn.zappy.app/801ae7a7b03d568b3b80500b04047054.gif
 It works fine (no line shifting) stock, but when I add an entry to `composition-function-table` the weirdness starts happening.
 I tried messing with the font in FontLab. I can fix the problem by increasing the Units per eM value, which causes the font to get smaller. I then increase the font height in Emacs to compensate. That works, but it's an odd thing to do, and I have to make the font height pretty large to get a normal-looking actual height. Other options in FontLab like increasing the line gap, safe descender value, etc didn't help.
 I'd like to understand why this is happening.
 EDIT: ";" (semicolon) is a more realistic example. I'm trying to create a ligature that will push ";;" closer together, for Lisp comments. However the semicolon in my font has a descender that extends below the baseline, causing the same line shifting effect as shown with the "g" above, when I try to use a ";;" ligature.

Are there any packages (or tools that play nice with ansi-term) that I could install to achieve btop level functionality? For instance, network and disk usage, better procedure grouping, etc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To understand ghc's package management better, I decided to manually install vector package and see if it gets picked up by hls and if the final program compiles.
 I went to the vector package on hackage, saw it had two dependencies, vector-stream and primitive. I downloaded vector, vector-stream and primitive using the commands,
 cabal get primitive cabal get vector-stream cabal get vector 
 then first I compiled the dependencies primitive and vector-stream, using cabal build. That gave dist-newstyle directory.
 Inside dist-newstyle\packagedb\ghc-9.8.2 there was a .conf file, I edited it to point all the file references to the ghc package database which is ghcup\ghc\9.8.2\lib\x86_64-windows-ghc-9.8.2.
 I placed the entire downloaded package directory (eg vector-stream-0.1.0.1) inside ghcup\ghc\9.8.2\lib\x86_64-windows-ghc-9.8.2.
 Then I registered the package with
 ghc-pkg register <file>.conf 
 After performing above steps for primitive, vector-stream and vector respectively, vector was now being picked up by hls. GHC also compiles and links fine.
 Did I do it correctly? Will there be any issues in the future?
 I know this is not the preferred way at all, and you should be using cabal which streamlines this process. Vector had just 2 dependencies which already comes with base so it wasn't much of a hassle. This only for learning purposes.

 Recently a colleague of mine introduced me to the wonders of Scala, which I ignored for years thinking that's just a "dead language" that's been surpassed by other languages.
 I've been doing some research and I was wondering why someone should start a new project in Scala when there ares new language which have a good concurrency (like Go) or excellent performance (like Rust).
 Since I'm new in Scala I was wondering if you guys could help me understand why I should use Scala instead of other good languages like Go/Rust or NodeJS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a backend that serves HTML using Warp and Servant (https://github.com/runeksvendsen/haskell-function-graph). Because some elements on the page take up to a second to load, I want to stream HTML to the client as it's produced, thus sending the slow-to-create HTML later.
 The HTML consists of (in order):
  
Static/pure "preamble" (which can be sent immediately)
 IO action streaming query results (which I want to stream as HTML one result at a time as they come in)
 A final IO action that calls out to an external process and produces HTML
  
I'm writing this post as I'm unsure what the most sensible way to achieve this is. On the one hand I would like to keep it as simple as possible — e.g. a MimeRender instance that produces a lazy ByteString. But this doesn't seem possible as the rendering involves IO. On the other hand I want to make sure that HTML is sent out as soon as it's produced, ie. no buffering on the server side — which makes me want to get a hold of some sendData :: Socket -> IO () function, so that I'm sure data is sent out when I want it. The former seems more elegant, but I don't see how it's possible (due to performing IO to produce the ByteString) and it's not clear to me how the server will buffer lazy ByteString chunks. The latter seems to do the job, but seems very low level.
 Any clues on how I should approach this?

 I have many questions like 
  
How many agenda files do you have? One for every project? Or a group of tasks? Or divided by year?
 Similarly what should the headings for the tasks be?
 How to find a particular TODO if you have multiple agenda files?
 How big do your agenda files get? What do you do if it gets too big?
 What happens to tasks that are DONE, do they get deleted or can you save them in history.
  
I need to see some example agenda files to understand how this works. I tried looking online but couldn't find any sample org-agenda files. Do any of you guys have an agenda file you are comfortable sharing?

 I work on a remote server regularly and hence use screen for running various codes on the terminal. But now I want to switch to emacs in order to run my code instead of the terminal. I have tried screen on both vterm and eshell and both have failed to run screen. So couple of questions:
  
What is the best "term/shell" mode in emacs to run screen?
 If I let go the idea of using screen, and willing to adapt to other options like tmux, what is the best "term/shell" mode? Basically which is your preferred way to run terminal commands on emacs (which also accommodate remote screen/tmux/others)
  
Please let me know.

 I installed emacs 29.3 to test(switching from 28.2) but something is wrong with the compilation buffer. When I run 'compile(with running a .sh file) another windows launches(as usual) .For some reason if .sh file outputs something emacs hangs for a half a second or even a second before rendering the output in the other buffer. The output still renders as fast as 28.2 but it hangs before rendering the first output. If there is no output for some reason it works as usual.
 This issue happens on both 29.2 and 29.3 but not on 28.2. Does anyone have any idea what could cause this?
 Edit:
 It seems like colored ansi buffer which was attached to the compilaiton buffer output causes this on 29.3 and 29.2, I disabled it and it's fixed.

Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.

A boolean is maybe true by Håkon Robbestad Gylterud
The following is an exploration of a few functions I found while writing various Haskell programs over the years. Their names collide with some standard function in Prelude, which is unfortunate, and while the new functions cannot be used as drop-in replacements of the prelude functions, they are morally generalisations.
cabal fields by Oleg Grenrus
cabal-fields is partly motivated by the Migrate from the .cabal format to a widely supported format issue. Whether it’s a solution or not, it’s up to you to decide.

 I'll shortly be starting a new role as a tech writer, where much of the docs are written in Docbook and DITA.
 I'm hoping to do the bulk of my work in org-mode and export to the required format.
 I've seen an exporter for Docbook, but I wonder if anyone has successfully used Emacs/org-mode to work with DITA content? Any recommendations? How are custom tags handled? And how can I best work with Docbook/DITA files that were created in another editor, like OxygenXML?
 Thanks in advance.

 import scala.concurrent.{Future, Await} import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration def asyncCalculation1() = Future { Thread.sleep(1000) 10 } def asyncCalculation2() = Future { Thread.sleep(1000) 20 } val c = asyncCalculation1().flatMap { a => asyncCalculation2().map { b => a + b } } val d = Await.result(c, Duration.Inf) println(d) 
 As far as I understood, first thread (T1) will execute the asyncCalculation1function and content inside the Future will be handed over to a new thread (T2). Handling the flatMap function won't a responsibility of T1 as first Future is not completed, but it will be blocked by the Await.result function until it is resolved. Or T1 is going back to the pool?
 Meanwhile T2 thread will wake up from 1sec sleep and will return 10 as the result and start executing the asyncCalculation2 function and it will create another thread (T3) while doing that. After that, what will happen to T2? Will it go back to the global thread pool this time? Or is it set to a blocked/waiting status as T1?
 And finally T3 is the one responsible for executing the callback inside the map function. And now since T3 is the last thread to complete, for whom the Await.result function is waiting for?? Is it T2 or T3 ??

verify properties
of Haskell programs. It used to be a standalone analyser tool,
but it was converted to a plugin later on. This makes it feasible to support Haskell modules that use the latest language features, and immediately integrates
the verification into the build workflows; but it also implies that Liquid Haskell
is rather coupled with the internals of GHC. A consequence of this
coupling is that a version of Liquid Haskell is likely to require
modifications to support newer versions of the compiler. The effort
of making these modifications is large enough that Liquid
Haskell has lagged three or four versions behind GHC HEAD.

 I can access the docker container's filesystem through the path /docker:container_name:/path/to/file. I'm using the clang-format package in emacs, which allows me to run clang-format on buffers. I'd like it to use the clang-format binary installed in the container. By default, it will look on my local filesystem, so have fiddled with the clang-format.el. It used to read:
 (defcustom clang-format-executable (or (executable-find "clang-format") "clang-format") "Location of the clang-format executable. A string containing the name or the full path of the executable." :group 'clang-format :type '(file :must-match t) :risky t) 
 and have bodged it to the following:
 (defcustom clang-format-executable "/docker:container_name:/usr/bin/clang-format" "Location of the clang-format executable. A string containing the name or the full path of the executable." :group 'clang-format :type '(file :must-match t) :risky t) 
 But when trying to run clang-format in a buffer, I get:
 apply: Searching for program: No such file or directory, /docker:container_name:/usr/bin/clang-format 
 Clearly I'm doing something stupid, but I'm sort of out of ideas at this point. Presumably this is actually possible; eglot can invoke `clangd` in the container as its LSP; that all works really nicely straight out of the box, but I have absolutely no idea where to even start looking in eglot to figure out how it works...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could anyone get a startup license for Akka from Lightbend? I've started from their website's Pricing page. I've filled out the huge license request form full with invisible (!) selection boxes.
 At the end I've reached the confirmation page.
 License request confirmation
 A few day later I've got an email with a link to the same page to fill out.
  
Dear Gyula, 
  
Thank you for your interest in Lightbend and registering for an Akka Startup License. 
 The Akka Startup License is a new BSL 1.1 source Available license, for Production usage, and there is no cost for companies with under $25M in revenue. Click here to register for an Akka Startup License.
 I've filled the same form again ang got exctly the same response... when I've found myself in an infinite loop. 
 I've also tried to respond to their email with the subject: "Last Chance for Akka Startup License!" which I've got the same response: fill out the (same) license request form I've filled out twice already.
 I get marketing newsletters since the first application, but still no idea how to reach them to get a startup license for my own small company. (way below $25M revenue)
 Any help would be most welcome!

 Any one know what else I should check or how to diagnose this ? I am on linux wayland with this emacs version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Read Emacs Coding-Conventions, it recommended
  
Indent the file using the default indentation parameters.
  
which means enabling indent-tabs-mode and results mixed SPACE and TAB.
 Checking some Emacs built-in packages, such as simple.el and indent.el, via global-whitespace-mode, you will find they are all mixed SPACE and TAB.
 However, many coding styles guide recommend (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil) to use spaces for indentation. No hard tabs.
 Do you use TAB or SPACE for indenting Emacs Lisp code?
 Personally, I prefer SPACE over TAB for two reasons:
  
Many other programming language now use SPACE for indentation.
 SPACE is compatible with more editors without special settings. Note that because of the tab-width variable, using TAB is not a problem in Emacs, but other editors might not. For example, this let* is not aligned on GitHub.
  
TAB has its own advantage, such as reducing code size, but it's no longer a problem in 2024.
 Unfortunately, if you'd like to submit patches to the GNU Emacs community, you might still have to use TAB instead of SPACE to follow the convention. That is why I am still keep indent-tabs-mode enabled now.
 Any comment about it?

 I often find myself wanting to edit TODO headers when viewing the Agenda (spelling errors, better phrasing, clarifying etc etc).
 My current process is: go to the offending line -> follow link to org file with TODO item -> edit header text -> save org-file -> reload Agenda view.
 But I can't stop thinking there must be a better/quicker way of doing this, something like Wdired for Agenda view?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! 
 I just started to organise myself with org-mode and org-roam. I tried out a bunch of different programs(notion, anytype, obsidian, logseq). From all of those Obsidian was the best since it was so easy to implement a working note taking system(and a second brain). The only problem with Obsidian is that it's not open-source and I can't use it on my work machine, so I decided to look for other options.
 In my work life I live in neovim like 90% of the time and I don't want to change that. (I tried Emacs for work, but that was a bad experience, since the lsp was slow and I spent several seconds between jump-to-definition etc.)
 I heard a lot about org-mode before, so I decided to give it a try and man.. I love it already. I see the unlimited possibilities(thatswhy it's so unfortuante that I can't use emacs as a primary IDE). 
 Now I'm trying to setup a meeting and personal tasking process for myself. In Obsidian I used the following people and meeting notes suggestion and it was very nice. people notes template, meeting notes template
 I'm looking for something similar. What I really like:
  
I have autocompletion for attendees
 I can query for meeting for an attendee in their person notes
 I can capture a new person very easily
 I can capture a new meeting either quickly or retroactively
  
I'm still learning the capabilities of org, org-roam, so I just wanted to ask you how to implement a similar approach? 
 Do you have any other recommendation for me?
 I also like that I can leave next actions as todos, so I can see them in org-agenda.

I won't go into a lot of detail, but basically it's traversing an s-expression graph and adding each sub-expression to a new representation, called a Case. When it adds a sub-expression, it checks whether that sub-expression has already been added, and if it has, it doesn't bother trying to add it again. In my old code, I can use a guard to do that check. In the new code, there's no way to use a guard (I think) because the Case is the state, and thus it is not directly available until I grab it with get. I have to do that twice, since my function is matching over two patterns, and thus the version of the code using the State monad and without guards is considerably lon…]]></summary>

After each user interaction with the web app, the server renders a new HTML, computes the diff, sends it to the client and the thin JS layer on the client side applies it to update the page.
 This tech is available with:
  
Elixir Phoenix - Live View
 Ruby on Rails - Hotwire
 C# Blazor
  
At a glance, it's an exciting tech as you no longer need to worry about splitting your app into two platforms, or at least minimize such a split.
 AFAIK Play or any other Scala web framework doesn't feature anything like that. Has anyone been working on an implementation for Scala? What are your thoughts on the tech? Particularly, Elixir claims they e.g. have an advantage over Ruby due to its parallel-first runtime - how do you think Scala's parallel capabilities (Akka, Pekko) relate to Elixir's runtime?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/completing-read-strings
 The package provides a function, completing-read-strings, that allows to read strings in the minibuffer, with completing-read under the hood.
 Usage:
 (completing-read-strings "PROMPT: " '("first" "sec,ond" "third")) 
  
The candidates are chosen by pressing RET.
 Pressing C-<backspace> erases the last chosen candidate.
 Pressing C-<return> exits reading and returns the list of chosen candidates.
  
Rationale
 In completing-read-multiple, the result list of chosen strings is made by splitting the input string with crm-separator regular expression variable.
 This approach is not suitable in several situations:
  
Candidates might contain the default , separator. In this case, the candidate with , inside will be treated as two typed candidates:
  
Example:
 (completing-read-multiple "PROMPT: " '("first" "sec,ond" "third")) ;; <selecting "sec,ond"> ;; => ("sec" "ond") 
 A developer have to locally rebind crm-separator and tell the user which character to type to separate the candidates.
 (let ((crm-separator "[ \t]*|[ \t]*")) (completing-read-multiple "Type `|' to select another candidate: " '("first" "sec,ond" "third"))) 
  
Candidates might contain any character, so it's hard to pick easily typed separator. Example: Org headings, file names. In this case a developer might use \n as a separator, which a user can enter by pressing C-o and moving the cursor 1 char forward to be able to display the list of candidates (which is not convenient).
  
Example:
 (let ((crm-separator "[ \t]*\n[ \t]*")) (completing-read-multiple "Prompt: " '("first." "sec,ond" "third;"))) 
 completing-read-strings solves the issue by providing a function that have the same interface for all kind of candidates. Internally, collects the chosen candidates into a list during reading and then returns it (without the need to split the input string with regular expression).

 I sometimes want LSP to auto-import some dependencies. When I call `lsp-execute-code-action`, expecting auto-import action to be executed, emacs creates empty file and moves me to there instead.
 When there is no code action, LSP inserts a dumb action for creating a new file and moving there. So if LSP is too slow to find out the actual code action needed, it creates a new file instead.
 This issue is ruining my workflow and wanted to ask if anyone else encountered. I got following shourtcut in my setup:
 (local-set-key (kbd "M-i f") 'lsp-execute-code-action)
 Any recommendations?

 Place the cursor somewhere (pos1) at LINE 1 (without mark anything), then scroll the text down through the window, press SHIFT and click at somewhere (pos2) at LINE 1000. The expected behavior is selecting all text content between pos1 and pos2, just like VS CODE and other modern editors. Is this behavior possible in Emacs?
 One possible technical barrier I found is that Emacs cursor moves as the screen scrolls and cannot be fixed in a certain position, except mark it manually. 
 P.s. I know there is variable `scroll-preserve-screen-position`, but it is not what I want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently upgraded from emacs 28.2 to 29.3. I noticed that if I opened an 11MB org-mode file (that used to give me no problems with speed or performance on 28.2) and then invoked org-refile once, then suddenly any user interaction involving the big 11MB buffer (from text entry to simply activating the buffer) would take forever to execute.
 I wondered if it was something in my config, and eventually noticed that switching org-refile-use-cache from t to the default nil stopped the slowdown from happening after invoking org-refile. I confirmed the issue was seemingly solved by running a minimal org-mode config in an emacs -Q session and observing that the slowdown only happened if org-refile-use-cache was set to t.
 So I decided to just stop setting org-refile-use-cache to t and everything …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently use Google Contacts to manage my contacts on Android and PC (web app). But I'm now trying to get rid of Google (I just started using notmuch, goimapnotify, mbsync, msmtp, etc. instead of Gmail web app).
 I read that synching Google Contacts with a Desktop was a nightmare, so I thought about using an open-source Android contact management app instead (like Fossify Contact, OpenContacts or ConnectYou).
 The idea would be to start from a Google Contact export and then continuously populate either the Mobile app or the Desktop app.
 On the Desktop side, I'd prefer to use Emacs (e.g. ebdb or org-contact). Ideally, Syncthing would do the sync between Mobile and Desktop.
 I couldn't find tutorials on how to implement this. Would you have any advice (my desktop OS is Linux Arch)?

 It looks like every character is swapped with something. It is reflective too which is very interesting in my opinion.
 It also looks like the frame is cursed, not the buffer :D. I can confirm that by opening the buffer in any other frame or opening any other buffer in this frame.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just installed a brand new Debian GNU/Linux 12 box, then installed GNU Emacs 28.2 using `apt-get install emacs`. It works fine. But when editing a regular text-file, I find about one time in eight that I press the space bar, as well as inserting the space, it emits a beep, as though I had typed C-g. This seems to be random: sometimes I will type 20 or more spaces with no beeps, other times two or three consecutive spaces might beep. The space-bar is bound to regular self-insert-command as you would expect.
 Does anyone know how to prevent this harmless but very irritating quirk?
 (And why is it happening straight out of the box?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[doctest is an amazing tool to maintain a consistent documentation, but also to avoid writing separate test files in some cases.
 There are multiple implementation of doctest with different tradeoffs:
  
doctest: the original one. See this pretty example: r/haskell/comments/14xizu0/haddockdoctestcairo/
 doctest-parallel. See its announcement: r/haskell/comments/rnkof1/ann_doctestparallel_isolate_and_speed_up_your/
 doctest-extract
 Maybe more, please share!
  
What is you experience with them and which one do you prefer?

It comes with copilot and I use it when something don't make sense in my code and to write commit messages and do a quick chat in vscode. I cant affort any other paid service and i hate using vscode. Neovim has a great extension for copilot chat with plethora of features but on emacs side the support is very minimal with just the copilot.el. I can understand why such thing land late in emacs community due to FOSS principles and i totally respect that. Should i lose hope on good copilot support in emacs and just accept the reality? Folks who use copilot is there any good copilot package that i am not aware of?

 You can see the glitching on left side of screen. I use NixOS with Hyprland and Emacs 29 (PGTK) with some transparency. I turn on my line numbers with `(nix-ts-mode . display-line-numbers-mode)` for example. I notice after resizing the frame all goes back to normal. Any ideas ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new version of Akka was released as announced by Akka's original author on X:
  
We were able to push her up to 1 million requests per second!!! On just 8 RDS instances.
 We also shipped a #Rust Akka client, extending Akka to run natively on #edge devices. “Akka Edge Rust” provides a subset of Akka implemented with the Rust programming language.
 Write simpler and more expressive code with Java 21.
 Plus much more https://www.lightbend.com/blog/akka-2405-more-security-more-performance-more-efficiency
  
Congrats to Lightbend and all the contributors behind Akka ! 👏
 Akka is recognized as one of the most prominent Scala toolkits and and has also served as the basis for the open-source fork, Pekko.

  ("ce" (find-file "~/.emacs.d/config.org") "emacs") 
 which runs find file on the exact path given after I open the menu and press the keys "ce".
 Now I also want to add shortcuts to all my common directories but doing something like:
  ("hd" (find-file "~/Downloads/") "downloads") 
 runs the find-file on the exact directory path which just opens a dired directory into Downloads. 
 What I really want though is after typing "hd" it opens the minibuffer with find-file command (as happens when you type C-X C-f) with the ~/Downloads path already open so I can just pick a file from Downloads from the minibuffer itself.
 Is there a function to make something like this possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 After reading a couple of posts on here covering aspects of gc-cons-threshold, I checked the documentation too. 
 As a not-very advanced Emacs user, I will admit that the topic is not very clear. Trying to summarize what I think I read:
  
by setting the gc-cons-threshold to a high value, garbage collection can be temporarily delayed
 
a large value shouldn't be used as the default.
 
 If the above is correct, would that suggest that:
  
I could set the gc-cons-threshold to a higher value at the beginning of the init.el
 
Use the after-init-hook to reset the value to a lower/default value.
 
 Does the above make sense or have I misunderstood the other threads/documentation?
 As regards the gc-cons-percentage, the doc says "If this portion is smaller than ‘gc-cons-threshold’, this is ignored". How can I check this?
 thank you

 I use Debug.Trace a lot in my project for quick and flexible generation of debug statements - without having to change my code (e.g. adding IO). However, since recently i do want to save my debugging output to a file. For this i thought i could redefine trace:
 myTrace :: String -> a -> a myTrace msg x = unsafePerformIO $ do withFile "debug.log" AppendMode $ \h -> do hPutStrLn h msg hFlush h -- Ensure the message is flushed to the file immediately return x 
 This works in some cases, but when applying everywhere in where i originally used trace, i quickly get: *** Exception: debug.log: openFile: resource busy (file is locked)
 Understandable. Is there an alternative approach for what i am trying to achieve? (writing quick debug statements to a file without having to change my code structure too much)
 Thanks

 I see a lot of posts here asking what monads and functors are. Obviously there's a lot that can go into answering that question, but I have been thinking about one simple answer. Monads and functors, like all type classes, are abstractions. That is, they take some abstract concept, such as (in the case of functors) applying a function to all the values within a computational context, and they apply this abstract concept to the concrete implementation across several different data structures.
 In doing this, type classes serve two purposes. Fi…]]></summary>

 I just took a look at python-ts-mode and saw that
 it does
 ```(setq-local treesit-font-lock-settings python--treesit-settings)```
 and after that to my surprise I checked python--treesit-settings and it kind of reimplements the same capture groups as the highlight file already created by the tree-sitter-python github https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python/blob/master/queries/highlights.scm
 for example
 ```
 :feature 'number
 :language 'python
 '([(integer) (float)] @font-lock-number-face)
 ```
 already exists in the highlights file
 ```
 [
 (integer)
 (float)
 ] @number`
 ```
 why can't we just use the highlight group `@number` somehow and set it to `@font-lock-number-face`
 seems a lot of double work if we do it for every language

 ThisBuild/usePipelining := true 
 Since I'm all-in on Scala 3 I just added the flag to my ~/.sbt/1.0/global.sbt.
 Sounds like this is just the first pass (heh, literally, see the PR), so we should be seeing still further speedups down the line -- amazing work, thanks team EPFL and Scala Center!
 p.s. merged PR is available in recently released 3.5.0-RC1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was reading the book Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton. In chapter 11, the game tic-tac-toe is implemented. My question is about the AI part of the game, where minimax is used. I was a little bit confused about the prune function:
 prune :: Int -> Tree a -> Tree a
 prune 0 (Node x _) = Node x []
 prune n (Node x ts) = Node x [prune (n-1) t | t <- ts]
 Why do we need such a prune function in Haskell (which has lazy evaluation). Why can't we just create a single infinite game tree, and run the fitness function on it to a certain depth, without creating a new finite tree via pruning? We can then reuse the same tree, by cutting it from the top after each move, and sort of expanding the (same) tree downwards. Shouldn't this also work? 
 I then saw that one of the exercises of that chapter was:
 generate the game tree once, rather than for each move 
 A solution for that exercise is provided here by someone on Github. However, it seems to me that here a new tree is generated after each move, and thus the tree is not shared during the whole game.

Is it possible to save this set of windows/layout and quickly switch to it in the future? Or when I'm programming, I typically have a main window with my code on the left with two smaller windows (compilation and vterm) next to it. I would like to be able to quickly switch between sets of predefined windows within a frame. Wouldn't that be amazing? Is such a thing possible?

 I've been using Emacs for 2+ years now. I started using because of its capabilities in VHDL coding, but soon got inspired by its efficiency. However, I feel I am severely underutilizing its potential. I'm a PhD student in Computer Engineering, and mainly use it for coding in python (with jedi). With this context, I want to ask the following questions:
  
Best package for Python? I find jedi decent, but not coding-friendly. I want to code faster in Python.
 For a Mac user, what are the key-bindings you suggest is optimal?
 Best use cases of org-mode as a PhD student?
 Best LaTeX packages & engines I need to install on Emacs? Currently I use Overleaf to work with collaborators, but would love to work on Emacs and push things to Overleaf (my vim friend does this).
 Ways to use Co-Pilot on Emacs? Is it worth it?
 Any other cool Emacs things (packages or modes) I should learn as a PhD student?
 Any cool stuff that can wow me about Emacs?
  
Please feel free to help even if you are not a PhD student. My goal is to learn how to use Emacs better at the end of the day..

 Is there an online place where I can paste some Scala 2 code with required braces, and have it show me that same code converted into Scala 3 braceless syntax?
 Does Scastie do it? If so, how? {related ticket, please go vote for it}
 Does the IntelliJ Scala plug-in facilitate it? If so, how? (related ticket, please go vote for it)
  
Here's a solution posted as a Reddit comment
  
This auto conversion would be invaluable for anyone who is distantly related to a Scala 2 project (or StackOverflow Question or Answer) and would like to easily explore the new Scala 3 syntax without having to invest a whole day in spurious technical tangents trying to configure something to enable them to do so.
 There are almost 20 years of Scala 2 codebases and forum code snippets where this would ease the ROI analysis of a Scala 3 explorer.
 tl;dr The overhead for experimenting with converting a Scala 2 code snippet into Scala 3 braceless syntax is so high for all but the most motivated Scala advocates.
 Wouldn't reducing the barrier to entry for casual drive-by exploration in something like Scastie (or IntelliJ) with a Scala 2 code snippet from the wild seems like it would be worth its weight in attention-grabbing and capturing the legions of possibly interested Java and Python software engineers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
This flow diagram was introduced in Field Report #5: How I Prepare Reading and Processing Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson:

I was hoping to discuss/ask some questions regarding it as I was recently processing it.
I'm guessing @Sascha will have to speak to this the most. But I am happy to have any others engage or share their thoughts.
Human Group
I was trying to understand the "Human" grouping and its sub-entities. What is it supposed to mean exactly? Is it what is happening within a human? Is there a semantic difference between the shapes under "human" and "zettelkasten?"
Is the entity under "human" an emergent outcome of the process it is connected to? For example, "overview of literature" is emerges in human understanding (ideally) when "researching" the "Sources of the world" and finding "Promising sources"?
Zettelkasten Group
What is the difference between the general group Zettelkasten (as opposed to Human) and the container "Zettelkasten" that has the two entities and one process "Atomic thoughts and connections," "Structuring & Integrating," and "Overview, Tools, Complex Insights"? Is the general group the Zettelkasten Method and the container the actual archive?
And, if the general group "Zettelkasten" is the Zettelkasten Method, what should the whole be called since the Zettelkasten method is a part of the whole?
Pre-processing
Is this a part of the barbell method (the first pass) or not?]]></summary>

I was thinking about doing multiple mini projects to learn and understand each types/type classes. My end goal is to make some server side projects in Haskell and to be ready to work with types and type class things when I use those frameworks or db frameworks like persistent. So what kind of smaller projects helped you learn particular types/type class. Is there some website like typeclassopedia that'd give some exercise, mini projects to teach these concepts?

 (use-package rjsx-mode
 :mode ("\\.tsx\\'")
 :hook ((rjsx-mode . lsp-deferred)
 (rjsx-mode . emmet-mode))
 :config
 (add-to-list 'lsp-enabled-clients 'ts-ls))
 I can add "\\.mdx\\'" to the mode definition however I want to use a different lsp client for the file type specifically mdx-language-server rather than ts-ls. Trying to decide the best way to handle this. I think one way would be to derive a mode from rjsx-mode but that seems like it might be overkill since there is no mode difference, just a difference in the configuration block. Probably thinking of the problem wrong.

 minbpe-hs
 Introduction
 minbpe-hs is a port of Andrej Karpathy's concise byte-level byte pair encoding (BPE) implementation, minbpe, to Haskell. During training, BPE compresses a sequence by repeatedly finding the most frequent pair of elements in the input and merging them into a new token whilst maintaining a record of the merges and the tokens. Encoding is performed by recursively merging pairs with the smallest merge index until there remain no pairs to be merged, and encoded representations can be decoded backed into the original through vocabulary look-ups. Given its recursive nature, BPE lends itself naturally to functional programming, and the objective of this repository is to offer an alternative functional formulation of it that is orthogonal to typical imp…]]></summary>

 Since I consider myself a part of this subreddit for some years, I wanted to let you know that I'm going to stop using reddit.
 As you might have expected, I've written a blog article explaining the reasons.
 I won't say that I will never ever log in to my reddit account and might contribute a comment in future. But chances to do so are poor because I will remove reddit from my feeds.
 I'm certainly not going to miss reddit as a platform. I surely will miss this subreddit community here. You've been great and I hope you will follow my ideas on embracing open solutions like Atom/RSS/Fediverse/Usenet in order to connect to each other for topics related to this subreddit.
 For now, I'm focusing on my blog, my Mastodon account, my new PIM lecture starting in October, and maybe also start writing on my PIM book which is in the concept and planning stage for over a decade.
 I really hope to see you on a better platform which respects its users and their contributions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone.
I consider this forum kind of “highly lectured” because we are all fans of knowledge and pretty much love to read, learn and improve everything we do. I picture us as carpenters working in the middle of the woods crafting excellence, although instead of wood and carpenter tools we use our brains, our zettlekasten and pen.
I don’t want to say too much because it’s not the point. Let’s just say I lost something that was really important to me. Something I cared, cherished, loved, tried to understand and that always put a smile on my face.
Now that it’s lost I have to learn what to do with this. I meditate and being mindful of all the feelings that arise inside me has been a really interesting experience. It of course doesn’t stop the grief or the sadness, but I think it makes it healthy. I’m at peace with my feelings, seeing me as the place where the river just has to flow.
I’m considering reading Albert Camus - The Stranger and No Mud no Lotus - Thich Nhat Hanh.
I’ve read before this event in my life works from stoicism and Buddhism which I think are really helping me to experience this in the best way possible.
Well, thanks for reading and I will appreciate the suggestions of books you found helpful during times where your psyche was put to the test.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya, just released this package that I was working on these past two days..
 It is a readwise integration for org-mode that will sync your readwise highlights into a org-format buffer or file.
 I use readwise heavily for highlights in both physical books and ebooks and have during the past year started using readwise reader heavily to annotate webpages and got so tired of not having a proper way to sync the highlights and notes into emacs. So I decided to just roll my own solution!
 There are quite a few quirks with the package right now, the main one being that it currently cleans the buffer and then repopulates it with the newly synced entries.. I am working for a smarter fix for this where it actually respects the buffer contents and just adds new highlights or modifies changed highlights to the correct entries, but I need to make this perfomant enough to not be a pain in the bottom to use..
 Well, here is the code! https://github.com/CountGreven/org-readwise I hope this helps some of you!

 Let's say I have a lot of open buffers, then do consult-buffer and type .py. From there I do embark-collect and now I have a collection buffer with all of the matching buffers from consult-buffer. Now I want to embark-act consult-line-multi on all of those buffers in the collection, so I can search only the one's I've narrowed down previously.
 This behaves in the way you expect using the buffer name as the search parameter for consult-line-multi searching across all of my buffers. Is there some additional step I can add to make consult-line-multi only search the collected buffers?
 Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a small program in Haskell that allows me to interact with Google's Gemini via Terminal and via VIM.
 It worked for about a week and then, suddenly, every request resulted in a connection timeout.
 At first, I thought the issue was with my API key, or with the fact that I was using a VPN. But while debugging, I've discovered that EVERY SINGLE REQUEST done with http-conduit fails.
 For example: If I open ghci -package http-conduit and run
 parseRequest "GET https://www.facebook.com" >>= httpBS 
 I get a Connection timeout exception.
 It does not matter what website I choose. I should say that CURL has no problem getting the responses, so it is definitely not my internet connection (evidenced by the fact that I'm asking for help here).
 What could be causing this?

 However, I also enjoy using siunitx. Unfortunately siunitx v.3 is not supported by mathjax v.3, or even worse, siunitx.js for mathjax is no longer maintained ( https://github.com/burnpanck/MathJax-siunitx ). As a consequence, equations containing siunitx commands are not displayed using mathjax, e.g. you still see
 \begin{equation}
 \left[ L \right] = \unit{\ohm\second} = \unit{\henry} 
 \end{equation} 
 when previewing.
 Does anybody has some ideas to circumvent the problem by defining some dummy routines substituting the siunitx stuff, e.g. the display could be
 [L] = \ohm\second = \henry
 or just
 [L] = 
 Maybe even a secret siunitx.js v.3 is arround...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had emacs set up as a webdev environment for javascript and php.
 I've got web-mode installed for these languages, and I had lsp-mode running. 
 Earlier this evening lsp stopped working.
 When I would open a php or js file, a message would come up in the minibuffer indicating that the respective language server woudn't start.
 I nuked my emacs config and then I uninstalled and reinstalled the language servers and emacs.
 Then I reinstalled web-mode and lsp.
 But I'm still getting the same issue.
 At the moment my messages buffer has these lines repeating:
  
LSP :: Restarting LSP in buffer test.js
 LSP :: Connected to [ts-ls:49920/starting /home/mantis/tmp].
 LSP :: ts-ls has exited (exited abnormally with code 1)
 Server ts-ls:49920/starting exited (check corresponding stderr buffer for details). Do you want to restart it? (y or n) y
 LSP :: Restarting LSP in buffer test.js
 LSP :: Connected to [ts-ls:49926/starting /home/mantis/tmp].
 LSP :: ts-ls has exited (exited abnormally with code 1)
 Beginning of buffer [6 times]
 previous-line: Beginning of buffer [20 times]
  
So how do I fix this mess?
 I've gotten very used to emacs for js/php and I'd really like to keep using it. But I need these IDE features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone.
 About a year ago, I started noticing random freezing of Emacs when saving files, freezing so long to the point that Emacs starts crashing. They were super annoying as 1) the crashes never saves anything and I lose some of my progress, even with autosaves; 2) they seem to happen frequent enough to notice, yet too sporadic to reproduce and investigate.
 Over a couple months, I ran some bisects and located the issue: it was the GC threshold.
 I tried blindly setting gc-cons-threshold myself and installing GCMH. The problems still persisted.
 I removed the GC setting for quite some time, but the noticeable slowdown during editing made be return to GCMH. With it came back the problem.
 Is there any reason behind this behavior? Is there a way to correct this?
 My Emacs configurations can be found in: here.
 Thanks a ton!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, I'd appreciate some basic assistance. I'm playing around with sum types (or ADTs) of records, and I get this odd bit of behavior.
  ghci> :set -XRecordWildCards ghci> data V = V{x :: Int, y :: Int} | W{a :: Int, b :: Int} deriving Show ghci> testq v@V{..} = v{x = 9} ghci> testq w@W{..} = w{a = 9} ghci> testq x = x ghci> :t testq testq :: p -> p ghci> testq V{x = 1, y = 1} V {x = 1, y = 1} 
 First, I don't know why the type of the function is p -> p rather than V -> V. Second, I don't know why the function fails to change the x value to 9 on the last line. That might simply be my ignorance of how RecordWildCards works.
 In general, are sum types of records a terrible idea? Will things break if some of the records have fields with the same name? I suppose name clashes could be addressed by defining the records separately in their own namespaces, and then putting them all together in the sum type. Finally, if there's a particular reference that would be valuable for better understanding how records work in Haskell, I'd appreciate a pointer. But perhaps the manual is sufficient: https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/records.html
 Thank you.
 EDIT: On a bit of investigation, it appears that you can use the same field in multiple records in a sum type. The bigger issue appears to be when a field is only in one record. You can write code that isn't type safe because it's calling a record selector that works on one record type on a different record type. Unless that's only ghci that lets you do that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm currently using emacs 27.1 at work (cannot install a newer version because we have a old fedora distribution for which no newer emacs exists). And I'd like to use the eshell more. According to this documentation https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eshell/History.html i can search for a last used command by a regex with M-s, which does work. But the cycling through possible other commands via M-n and M-p doesnt work. I can see in a minibuffer, that it is cycling from "history item 27" to "history item 31" etc. but the command is not shown in the eshell. It just shows the first finding.
 Is this an acutal bug or am i getting something wrong? I'd prefer to use as few packages as possible and keep my dependencies low. So i really just need that eshell history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to create a link in my dailies to my present note as soon as a date block (2024-05-23) is existing in my notes. I usually write with org-roam. I must admit, the division between my dailies and other notes is not well done... but it is how I am working now.
 I would like to have the possibility when the point is on a date (for instance 2024-05-22) to create a link in my dailies to the current heading, to the proper daily note if existing, or to a new daily note if not (under a predefined subheading)
 With the help of chatgpt (sorry, no dev here), I have this code:
 ``` (defun my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point () "Create or open an Org-roam daily note for the date at point. If the daily note already exists, add a new heading." (interactive) (let ((date (or (thing-at-point 'date) (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d" (org-read-date nil t))))) (if date (let ((parsed-date (org-read-date nil t date))) (org-roam-dailies-goto-date parsed-date) (when (derived-mode-p 'org-mode) (goto-char (point-max)) (unless (bolp) (insert "\n")) (insert "* "))) (message "No date found at point."))))
 (define-prefix-command 'org-roam-map) (global-set-key (kbd "C-c n") 'org-roam-map)
 (with-eval-after-load 'org-roam (define-key org-roam-map (kbd "d") 'my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point)) ```
 2 problems I see: 1. I want to use a keybinding when the point is on a date to create the link ==> I am not sure the latest part for the creation is OK and that the proper keymap is chosen
  
So far, instead of reading the date at point to create the daily note or insert the link into an existing one, it uses the function org-roam-dailies-goto-date which asks again for a date from the calendar. 
  
how would you improve this function? thanks for your ideas!

 I am thinking of using libraries like https://picocli.info or scallop https://github.com/scallop/scallop. But these will give you CLI facility, not REPL. Is there a library specific for REPL? It should support interactive CLI support such as dynamic filtering etc. Something seen while using oh-my-zsh
 Something similar in javascript - https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk for coloring
 Or I have to code it putting in infinite loop with some time waits or user interuptions ?

I really like Vim motions and Neovim has a headless mode which powers Firenvim and the VS Code Neovim extension, allowing Vim motions in textareas in those apps with Neovim as a backend. I think that would be better than using something like Evil mode which emulates Vim. If there isn't a pre-existing solution, would it be worth learning Elisp and implementing it myself?

 So the past few days I have been trying to improve my problem solving skills using Haskell and I am learning a lot. I have mainly been looking at smaller exercises provided by Advent of Code. I believe these open ended problems provide a good basis for practice as I have a lot of freedom but in this freedom is also what I believe to be the largest pitfall as I can easily resort to thought patterns not meant for the functional paradigm. After working through some exercises I went back to Day 3 ( https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3 ) because when I first looked at it I had no clear idea of what Haskell could provide me in order to solve the problem in a streamlined manner, so I skipped …]]></summary>

 But I can't find the way to create on-the-fly filter with them.
 For example:
 I run find-file then start type into minibuffer: foo
 I will show a list having 4 files has foo
 I want when I press C-c C-m, It would search content of that 4 file, then filter out the files have string bee in it's content. (then the result will only have 2 files)
 Then I could press C-c C-n to reset result tobe 4 file as when I search foo before.
 Is that possible with vertico/consult or I have to use others like orderless, prescient.el?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use emacs-wiki for...everything. I have a very large repository across several different disciplines, using it for everything from a journaling platform to a digital Zettelkasten.
 A long time ago I used to just use outline-mode and a "one huge text file" approach to this kind of thing.
 I'd about kill to get the asterix indicated outline functionality folded in to wiki-mode.
 I've been a developer for the better part of a half-century, but haven't touched elisp since the 90s.
 How tough is that likely to be? I started cracking in to outline mode to make sense of it, but the code structure is so flat I'm having trouble navigating it.
 Any ideas?
 EDIT: Dammit. Sorry y'all. It's not "wiki-mode" but "emacs-wiki" by Wiegley and Schroeder

 Hyperbole makes it easy to create fully interactive HTML applications with type-safe serverside Haskell. It's inspired by HTMX, Elm, and Phoenix LiveView
  
Hackage

Motivation
 I've been a web developer since before "Ajax". I rode the wave of Single Page Applications (SPAs) and loved how interactive we could make things. I've written fancy apps in React and Elm. But ultimately SPAs mean writing two applications, a Javascript client and a server, plus an API between them. They're a huge pain to write and maintain. I missed serverside web apps.

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I'd love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK and why I'm here:
This forum and my zettelkasten are spaces where I feel comfortable taking risks and trying out new things without the fear of failure holding back. Maintaining a sense of purpose while facing real challenges is crucial. Predicting future developments is a key indicator of expertise in any field. Amateurs react, professionals respond, and masters anticipate.

that definitely was not the case during an internal two-day hackathon Tweag’s GenAI group

As one of our projects, we wanted to develop a tool that would tell us where exactly time
flew to in a given period of time, and so was born work-dAIgest: a Python tool that uses your
standard workplace tools (Google Calendar, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Slack, …) and a large
language model (LLM) to summarize what you’ve accomplished.
In this blog post, we’ll present a proof-of-concept of work-dAIgest, show you
what’s under the hood and finally touch quickly on a couple lessons we learned during this
short, but fun project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[so It says that I can use M-. to go to the definition of variables and functions if I create a TAGS file using ETAGS if I got it correct.
 I wanted to try it on the buffer exercise in 4.6
 ```
 • Using ‘xref-find-definitions’, find the source for the
 ‘copy-to-buffer’ function.
 ```
 so I went to copy-to-buffer. Did M-. and it opened a file finder so basically nothing
 I did C-h f on it, went to the file simple.el
 checked where it is at and it is at `/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/` in my mac
 so I opened a terminal, did
 `etags /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/simple.el.gz`
 saw a TAGS file. checked it and I have a value for copy-to-buffer function
 ```
 (fixi) ➜ lisp cat TAGS | grep -i copy-to-buffer
 (defun copy-to-buffer 6813,291207
 ```
 now I went back to emacs, did M-x visit-tags-table
 added the TAGS file.
 checked
 `M-: (symbol-value 'tags-table-list)`
 and saw the right value `("/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/TAGS")`
 now when I try to do M-. on copy-to-buffer or when I try M-x xref-find-definitions and choose copy-to-buffer I get `user-error: Rerun etags: ‘^(defun copy-to-buffer ’ not found in /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/simple.el`
 what am I doing wrong?

 Regardless, I'm writing some Scheme code for fun and practice, and I realized that when I want to be a fancy pants Rich McGee over here and use λ instead of lambda, it doesn't work in emacs like it would in DrRacket -- which sucks because DrRacket is ugly and emacs is pretty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VSCode and Emacs are both excellent editors, and I use them simultaneously on Windows. However, one annoying point is that the keybinding styles of these two editors are inconsistent.
 For example, in VSCode:
  
Ctrl-z -> undo
 Ctrl-x -> cut
 Ctrl-c -> copy
 Ctrl-v -> paste
  
While in Emacs, Ctrl-x and Ctrl-c keys are used as prefix keys (C-x, C-c) for most of Emacs' built-in commands.
 One way to keep they consistent is to use CUA-mode, but its implementation is quite tricky (e.g., cua-prefix-override-inhibit-delay = 0.2), so I'm not very keen on using it.
 Are there any alternatives to CUA-Mode?
 One possibility I can think of is the Windows Key. 
 For example, 
  
Use the Windows Key on the keyboard as Emacs' Control key, which means that the original C-x prefix can be pressed by the Windows Key (you might say that "the prefix key C-x" now is actually "prefix key s-x", but keep in mind it is handled underhood); 
 At the same time, use the Ctrl key on the keyboard as Emacs' Super Key, which means I can bind custom commands to the Super Key.
  
If this works, I can define a clean "cut operation" like: 
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-x") 'kill-region) ; Note here the `s` is actual Ctrl Key not Win Key (Super Key) on keyboard 
 It won't affect prefix key such as C-x, because C-x is now driven by the Windows key.
 Is this possible in Emacs? Does anyone have experience with this? Or do you have a better solution?
 Thanks!

I wanted to ask this question so they could learn the most useful and commonly used CT concepts first and then simply focus on mastering programming in Haskell after that. They can then come back to cat theory later on. I thought it'd be hard to try to learn both programming and CT together for beginners.

I've already run "cabal install haskeline" successfully, but I still get an obtuse error message from ghc. What do I need to do to make this work? I've tried googling about cabal and build-depends, but nothing I've found can tell me what file to edit nor what text to add to it. :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use ESS for R and I'm very happy with it. One issue I'm having, though, is that there doesn't seem to be any obvious way to set up a specific R version/conda environment per project. I'm aware of the shell+ess-remote alternative, but it is very clunky. I often need to launch several R sessions per script, and it becomes very annoying.
 Is there any way to tell ESS "for this project use R from this conda environment"?
 Edit:
 this workaround is acceptable for now, I guess:
  (defun ess-remote-auto () (interactive) (setq num (read-number "input: " 1)) (setq env-dir (read-directory-name "input: " "../env")) (when (one-window-p) (split-window-horizontally)) (other-window 1) (let* ((buffer-name (format "*R-%02d*" num)) (buffer (get-buffer buffer-name))) (if buffer (switch-to-buffer buffer) (shell) (process-send-string (get-buffer-process (rename-buffer buffer-name)) (format "conda activate %s \n R\n" env-dir )) (ess-remote buffer-name "R"))) (other-window 1) (ess-switch-process))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When typing a commit in Magit, if my commit message gets too long, the editor automatically line-wraps, causing the second line to be colored red.
 https://preview.redd.it/cm7q3dubsg1d1.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5c80073b73d716d1ccac929481c5ff2b3903390
 Then, if I try to commit with that message, I get a notification that "Second line is not empty. Commit anyway? (y or n)", since by convention Git messages should have an empty second line. It gets to the point where: If I want to continue writing my commit message, I have to backspace, then hit C-q SPACE (since SPACE on its own triggers the word wrap behavior), which is a really obnoxious way of typing.
 So my question is: Why does Magit even bother putting the line break in there, if it's just going to complain about that same line break in ten seconds? And can I disable the automatic word wrap, since it's objectively making my commit messages worse and less correct?

 This version introduces new major features and important fixes. Main highlights:
  
kyo-tag: Kyo now has a new type Tag implementation that provides allocation-free sub-type checking. This new solution addresses safety issues with effect handling in generic scopes and its improved performance unblocks some important new features and fixes. A separate artifact kyo-tag is produced with no dependency on any other Kyo modules, enabling the use of the new Tag in isolation by other projects.
 kyo-zio: The initial implementation of the ZIOs effect is included in this new release. It provides a seamless integration between Kyo and ZIO via two methods: ZIOs.get transforms a ZIO computation into a Kyo one, and ZIOs.run transforms Kyo computations into ZIO. These methods can even be used…]]></summary>

Guide on Medium: https://medium.com/@jamesjg/introducing-tarp-stack-tapir-react-and-postgresql-3e4c2bbbe22f
 Or full access on LovinData blog: https://lovindata.github.io/blog/2024/04/18/introducing-tarp-stack---tapir-react-and-postgresql/
 The codes: https://github.com/lovindata/blog/tree/main/assets/posts/2
  
This guide answers questions like:
  
How to set up a Scala Tapir backend with a TypeScript React frontend for local development?
 How can my React frontend communicate with my Tapir backend REST API?
 How to serve my React frontend application through the Tapir backend?
 How to build an image for production with an optimized Dockerfile (small and fast to build) using Docker layer caching and multi-stage builds?
  
If these kinds of questions have arisen at any point, or if you are like me—a Data Engineer knowing Scala who wants to build full-stack applications—you should definitely take a look 👍
 I often use this tech stack for prototyping personal projects. At work, I've also used Tapir and PostgreSQL a lot for showing POCs. Initially, my goal was just to have code snippets that I could quickly copy and paste. But why not make it a complete guide so everyone can use it? 🫡
 The guide took up part of my latest one-week vacation (5 days PTO 😭). I didn't expect it to take that long, but it's done now, and I really hope it will be useful to at least one of you! 🙏
 I write monthly on the LovinData Blog and on Medium, and like to give back the knowledge I've learned. So don't hesitate to reach out; I'm always available to chat about nerdy stuff 🤗! Here are my socials: LinkedIn, Twitter and Reddit. Otherwise, let's learn together in the next story 🫡! Bye ❤️.

 This isn't the first time that i make a wayland client without using libwayland, i made it with C, Hare and Typescript(Deno).
 Another day I will improve the program so that it can open a window and draw something in it
 Here is a link to the code, since I would like to know in what aspects could improve the code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, in my "quest" to understand Monads, people told me to study Functors, Applicatives, Semigroups and Monoids and understand how they work first. I did so and thought that I had finally reached an understanding with the whole thing... until I was told my understanding was wrong.
 Starting from the beginning: I went to study Functors, most places talking about them just talk about how fmap works, and I understood them as "Anything that has a definition of fmap". 
 The other places talk about it's category theory definition: This, together with me reading that "All Functors in Haskell are actually Endofunctors", made me "click" this exact thought "Wait, if the definition of an Endofunctor is when a category maps to itself, and fmap returns the same typeclass as the one it receives as input, therefore the typeclasses are the categories here and that's why they're called Endofunctors! I got it!".
 So I went to ask people about how a "non-Endo" Functor would be... and that's when I was told that the explanation I came with was wrong: Typeclasses are not "categories" in this context, people say "All Functors in Haskell are actually Endofunctors" because the "category" here (Called Hask) is the set of all types in Haskell (And indeed, all mappings to a type in Haskell yield... a type in Haskell), but that simply destroyed the prior understanding I had and made the word "Functor" meaningless to em again.
 Given that the concept of fmap and Functor are so closely related, is the fact that fmap always returns the same structure as the one of the input it is given (e.g. a fmap with a List will always yield a List, a fmap with an IO monad will always yield an IO monad, a fmap with a Either Monad WON'T EVER yield a Maybe Monad) just a coincidence, having nothing to do with the definition of either a Functor or an Endofunctor?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: Resolved. See my post in the comments section.
 Hey everyone!
 I have a systemd service in .config/systemd/user/ where I start emacs from on boot. The important pieces from that are:
 ``` [Service] Type=notify ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/emacs --fg-daemon
 [Install] WantedBy=default.target ```
 Anyway, it's been great for a long time. I have gnome open up a emacsclient in a new frame when I want to open emacs and boom, it is up instantly.
 The one thing that I didn't realize might be related and I ignored for a long time... When I use xwidget-webkit-browse-url it shows a blank white screen. When I use emacs directly (instead of through an emacsclient from the instance started by systemd), it works properly.
 I get the following error when I do a systemctl --user status emacs:
  May 18 21:30:31 work-dev emacs[3306]: ../../../../../gdk/x11/gdkwindow-x11.c:5653 drawable is not a native X11 window May 18 21:30:31 work-dev emacs[3306]: ../../../../../gdk/x11/gdkwindow-x11.c:5653 drawable is not a native X11 window May 18 21:30:31 work-dev WebKitWebProces[19150]: cannot open display: 
 I assumed that maybe it was an issue where $DISPLAY wasn't set properly so I did M-x setenv and set DISPLAY to :1 (same as what I found from a terminal emulator) and no luck. I also tried WEBKIT_FORCE_SANDBOX=0 and GDK_BACKEND=x11
 Any thoughts? Thanks!

 I'm looking for a TTS elisp package for use with Emacs. Primarily for speaking text from documents stored in Calibre via the calibredb package. It would be an awesome bonus if the TTS was not only able to speak regions but also generate audio files from documents and chapters of documents.
 So far it looks like Piper is the most promising option for an offline TTS. I just need to find some integration points between it and Emacs.

 I'm not sure what is going on here. Does anyone know how to solve? If not I will report it. Thx

 I am able to launch emacs from terminal by typing $ emacs -nw
 I am able to close emacs by pressing Ctrl+X followed by Ctrl+C
 I have also installed the prelude addons by bbatsov.
 But could someone please tell me the basics for navigating in emacs?
 When I launch emacs I can see a top menu (File, Edit, Options, etc.) How can I access those by mouse and by keyboard? In windows I would press the Alt key followed by the arrow keys.
 Also what is the key for cancel? For example if I press Ctrl+X, how do I back up to the state before pressing those keys?

 Sonatype Central. Gears Book.
 I heard about the book a while back, but the library wasn't published.
 //> using scala 3.4.0 //> using dep "ch.epfl.lamp::gears::0.2.0" //> using nativeVersion "0.5.1" import gears.async.* import gears.async.default.given u/main def main() = Async.blocking: val hello = Future: print("Hello") val world = Future: hello.await println(", world!") world.await 
 Now it runs :D
 Btw, I'm not related to the project, and I'm just a user. This is for anyone wanting to play around who also attempted it but didn't want to build it like me.
 On another note... I hate that Async.blocking can be closed with {}, but when I'm using the : syntax, I can't used end, like end Async.blocking or something of the like.
 Async.blocking: ... end Async.blocking 
 ...when the language spoils you so much that you start wondering why it's not 100% perfect.
 To fewerBraces, I'm still not sure if I like you for getting rid of those annoying symbols, or if I am willing to put up with your irregularities.

 Two small questions. 
 When I launch lsp in a buffer with a .T file lsp-log says command "my_lsp is not present on path" The my_lsp executable is in my .emacs.d/packages/ folder which is added to path at the top of my init file. It isn't advanced enough to require parameters yet. It also executes successfully if I type ./my_lsp in a terminal. It produceses a log file to confirm this. Is that not the path it means? I tried adding it to my Linux path with a source command but it didn't change anything. 
 Second, does the fact that it's in fundamental mode matter if I'm using the regex syntax to add to lsp-language-id-config? By using regex I thought I understood that the mode didn't matter because I'm defining it by file extension instead. Any help clarifying this would be very helpful. Thanks
 (with-eval-after-load 'lsp-mode (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(".*\\.T$" . "T")) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection "my_lsp") :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on "T") :server-id 'my_lsp)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HVM2 is a runtime for high-level languages like Haskell and Python. It is like Haskell's STG, and could, one day, be an alternative runtime that GHC targets. After years of hard work and polish, with emphasis on correctness, it is finally production ready. And it runs on GPUs now!
 Unfortunately, we do not compile Haskell to it yet. Turns out such project is much harder than I anticipated, and we don't have the scale to do it yet. There are still no brackets/croissants, as the performance impact of these is too harsh to keep it practical. I'll keep working hard to make it happen one day.
 I'm posting this because it might interest one of you. The new atomic linking algorithm on HVM2's paper is beautiful and I think some of you will enjoy. Please do delete the thread if you think it is off-topic here. HVM2 is written in Rust. We only use Haskell directly on Kind's new checker, but it isn't released yet. :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backwards is a way to run Applicative actions in backwards order.
 I decided to try if you could define a Monad backwards, but with a MonadFix constraint: 
 instance MonadFix m => Monad (Backwards m) where (>>=) :: forall a b. Backwards m a -> (a -> Backwards m b) -> Backwards m b (>>=) = coerce bind where bind :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b bind as next = mdo b <- next a a <- as pure b 
 I think it's pretty much useless, but who knows. I was able to run an example that is actually an Applicative instance, since the computations are independent. 
 -- >> conversation putStrLn readLn -- Hello A -- < 100 -- Hello B -- < 200 -- Hello C -- = (100,200) conversation :: Monad m => (String -> m ()) -> m Int -> m (Int, Int) conversation say getInt = do say "Hello A" n <- getInt say "Hello B" m <- getInt say "Hello C" pure (n, m) -- >> conversationBackwards putStrLn readLn -- Hello C -- < 100 -- Hello B -- < 200 -- Hello A -- = (200,100) conversationBackwards :: forall m. MonadFix m => (String -> m ()) -> m Int -> m (Int, Int) conversationBackwards = coerce do conversation @(Backwards m) 
 Adding a dependency, not surprisingly, gives me: Exception: cyclic evaluation in fixIO.

Vertico previews don't seem to handle images and completing-read ignores my sort order. I tried spawning a dired buffer and using dired-get-file-for-visit, but this is clumsy and inconvenient; I can't find a way to do it that is as simple as "press keybinding, select file, link is inserted." Googling around gets me nothing. Is there anything else I can try?

 Very new to Haskell and I'm trying to do real-world things with it, maybe too soon. I have this short program
 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} module Substances where import qualified Control.Exception as E import Data.Aeson.Parser.Internal import Data.Aeson.Types import Data.ByteString import Network.HTTP.Simple getSubstancesJson :: IO (Response ByteString) getSubstancesJson = httpBS "https://api.fda.gov/other/substance.json?limit=1" getResults :: IO () getResults = do E.bracket resp onError $ \body -> do let json_ = eitherDecodeStrictWith jsonEOF ifromJSON body case json_ of (Right j) -> putStrLn j Left (path, err) -> putStrLn ("Error " <> show err <> " at " <> show path) where json = getSubstancesJson resp = getResponseBody <$> json onError = const $ getResponseStatusCode <$> json 
 This compiles and runs but it shows that the path is an empty list. The error message is "expected String but encountered Object". I know this data source produces valid JSON and I'm wondering where I am going wrong and how I might get a more descriptive error here. Also general style critiques are much appreciated. Thanks everyone in advance, this is a really cool language and I'm excited to finally learn!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: Thank you all for the helpful replies! I am currently bedridden and very ill but at least now I can have something to do!
 It seems like this is a recurring question but it is just really confusing and I need some guidance. 
 I just want to hone my haskell programming skills meaning that whenever I find exercises or puzzles I will look for modules that implement functions I can use without having to write em myself. These packages aren't in base. For example on hackage I found digits. 
 In python i would just create a venv, pip install away and trash the entire environment when done, leaving me with a clean global installation. 
 Reading about cabal and messing with it ever so slightly I am already afraid that everything is about to go to hell. I read about hsenv and how supposedly it is kinda the same (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsenv) so I guess I can use that and just cabal install --lib away there but havent tried it yet.
 How do you guys do this? How do you mess around and experiment with non-base modules after which you remove what is unnecessary leaving you with a clean system? I just want to write some basic scripts, maybe at some point write some larger applications. Every single time I get drawn back in again (it is all for my own benefit, i am not required to learn haskell) I am met with this exact same nonsense where I just blank out and ditch it because my global installation gets f*cked. I am sick of it! I love the language! Have so for years! Help me love this tooling by telling me how you handle it!
 Edit: for the record i have everything installed using ghcup, i am also fairly familiar writing haskell code. I just want to know how everybody goes around writing basic scripts without initializing an entire project if you just need 50 LOC for some leetcode or advent of code puzzle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning everyone, I would like to ask for your help to not let whitespace-mode interfere with company-mode.
 https://preview.redd.it/z68p4zt1gs0d1.png?width=330&format=png&auto=webp&s=056e32e46780efeac8dcae318dd13d48bab733e3
 Company-mode is very slow since I enabled whitespace-mode, I would like to ask for your help to optimize it.
 This is the code for whitespace-mode:
 (use-feature whitespace :defer 2 :diminish (global-whitespace-mode) :custom (whitespace-line-column 80) (whitespace-global-modes '(not shell-mode eshell-mode help-mode magit-mode magit-diff-mode ibuffer-mode dired-mode occur-mode)) (whitespace-action '(cleanup auto-cleanup)) (whitespace-style '(face trailing tabs spaces newline missing-newline-at-eof empty indentation space-after-tab space-before-tab space-mark tab-mark newline-mark)) :config (global-whitespace-mode +1)) 
 This is the code for company-mode:
 (use-package company :diminish (company-mode) :defer 2 :preface (setq tab-always-indent 'complete completion-cycle-threshold 3) :custom (company-idle-delay 0.5) (company-show-quick-access t) (company-minimum-prefix-length 2) (company-tooltip-limit 10) (company-tooltip-flip-when-above t) (company-tooltip-align-annotations t) ;; EXP (company-require-match nil) (company-global-modes '(not erc-mode message-mode eshell-mode)) ;; (company-tooltip-annotation-padding 1) ;; (company-format-margin-function 'company-text-icons-margin) ;; (company-text-icons-add-background t) (company-files-exclusions '(".git/" ".DS_Store" "node_modules/")) (company-dabbrev-other-buffers 'all) (company-dabbrev-downcase nil) (company-dabbrev-minimum-length 2) ;; (company-transformers '(delete-consecutive-dups ;; company-sort-by-occurrence)) :config (global-company-mode +1)) 
 Thanks in advance to everyone.

Cabal-3.12.0.0 released! by Francesco Ariis
The Cabal team is happy to announce the release of Cabal the library version 3.12.0.0.
Cabal exact printing by Jappie J. T. Klooster
For a long time, I’ve been annoyed that cabal tells you to add modules to your cabal file. It’s can of detect missing modules, but won’t automatically add them. This is not a big deal for a single module, but if you like splitting code into many small modules, for example because you like fast compile times, then any refactor may cause many of these messages to appear, which becomes tedious to manage.

The first one is that if I quit dirvish with q and then call it again, it forgets what folder I was last at. Is it possible to make it stay "in the background" in the folder I have it.
 The second issue is I'd like something like ranger's tabs you can switch with <TAB>. This is particularly useful when copying from one folder to another.

I am very interested in this language but unfortunately I have not been able to find a proper environment to develop scala projects. I have tried Eclipse and failed because as soon as I install the necessary plugin for scala, the IDE no longer launches, I have tried installing Metals on Vs code, and it just fails to connect with the build server apparently, I can't afford Intellij and I think using the online sites is not an option for my project(too many files parallel programming etc.) and using the command line is out of the question (too much hassle, will definitely have trouble debugging, writing the code). I would like to have a program for development instead. Can anyone please help me out here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I tried to configure <tab> keybinding to have different behavior in different scenarios. In order to do this I wrote my custom function|
 ```lisp (defun vd/tab-indent-or-complete () "Function to choose correct TAB action." (interactive) (cond ((derived-mode-p 'org-mode) (org-cycle)) ((derived-mode-p 'minibuffer-mode) (minibuffer-complete)) (t (progn (when (fboundp 'tempel-complete) (tempel-expand)) (indent-for-tab-command)))))
 (define-key global-map (kbd "<tab>") 'vd/tab-indent-or-complete) ```
 In org mode and in regular buffers this works as expected, but in minibuffer it acts very weird. If I type Alt-x, I get minibuffer with vertico interface, but when I type <tab> word Completion appiers instead of M-x and until I press C-g it "override" M-x minibuffer. If I press <tab> again it creates more Completion buffers(in picture Completion [2] change to Completion [4]) and I need to close them with C-g.
 Here are images with this behavior https://imgur.com/a/yZQhgzn

 TL;DR: my CONSULT-LINE is case-sensitive which is why I sometimes don't find stuff because of capitalisation. (How) can I change that?
 I am falling in love with the capacities of CONSULT as of late (especially when combining its results with EMBARK-EXPORT, holy moly!). However, I noticed that I can't find stuff if it is capitalised or in allcaps. This is not good, because I thus overlook stuff I'd want to find in a buffer.
 I tried tweaking ISEARCH-related variables, but to no apparent avail. I also tried delving into the source code, but I did not really understand how CONSULT-LINE produces its results.
 Can you tell me which variables I need to tweak for consult-line to be case-insensitive when searching?
 Have a good day, fellows :)

 Not exactly an emacs post, but one that can be useful to those running emacs under OS X.
 if you use hammerspoon, I wrote a function that might be useful to others to quickly go to emacs wherever you are.
 The idea is that whenever I press my own prefix (C-M-c):
 If I am in emacs, things happen as usual.
 If I am not in emacs, the pressed keys are never seen by the current app, instead, the last active window of emacs gets raised, and the sequence gets sent to emacs.
 my prefix has (sub)commands for org-agenda, org-capture, mu4e, etc. so it is easy to start executing them without first finding emacs.

 I'm trying to shopt -s nocaseglob and a bunch of others for tramp, and my attempts have failed. 
 has anybody tried this? remote shell is /bin/sh, which means it should use ~/.profile, but nothing I change there affects tramp (PATH or setopt). 
 I tried using bash as remote shell, but that didn't help. Any tips welcome.

 I like org more than markdown, but most org apps are iOS-only, abandoned or made for scheduling rather than notes (more commonly all three combined).
 If there're by chance any GMs that know any outstanding non-org apps for this purpose they can suggest, those would be cool too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is anyone here using iOS native tools and exporting / importing data to and from .org files somehow? I've been using iOS and Siri with some success so far, but I still want Org on the 'backend' for the granularity in organization, ease of adding and manipulating properties, capturing stuff while at a keyboard etc. 
 I'm asking because I've been away-from-keyboard lately, and so my only hope to keep up with stuff is voice commands. I don't want to abandon Org completely though and see a lot of value in it for organizing my stuff more thoroughly and it helps me think through stuff and complete longer term projects in a way I don't see iOS tools doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I want to store lots of data in lists, thousands of lists perhaps. But I'm guessing it would be bad to associate each of these storage lists with its own defvar (setq) symbol. Could I simply do something like this
 #+name: 05283a07-3c44-4f64-8629-f0b8fbc7d214 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never (list 'floor (list 'front 'kitchen 'hall 'br1 'br2)) #+end_src 
 or just
 #+name: 05283a07-3c44-4f64-8629-f0b8fbc7d214 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never '(floor (living kitchen hall br1 br2)) #+end_src 
 and have them scattered in an org-mode file where I need them. Then I could tangle them
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never :tangle floordata.el :noweb yes <<05283a07-3c44-4f64-8629-f0b8fbc7d214>> ... #+end_src 
 Sure, I could do this, then all these lists would be in the file floordata.el. But then they're all symbol-less. Is there a way (I heard there is) to make a hash table out of these lists with a symbol name attached to each? It would be great to have symbol name (defvar, setq) given to each list, but that would bog down if I were to create thousands of these things, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a bit lost of how this things interact. I will describe what I want to make first
  
Use pylsp through eglot,
 Have a virtual enviroment for each python project,
 Be able to manage the enviroments through emacs (tried poetry and pipenv),
 Have the linting, lsp, jedi, black, flake8, ruff, etc installed out of my project venvs, as some of these are shared with others.
 Have it easy to change, or automatic between enviroments when I change projects.
  
I have tried some things (pipenv, virtualenvwrapper and poetry), but it ends up breaking when I try to isolate projects. It sort of worked when I had everything installed directly on debian, when I tested things with a fresh install, but not if I try to leave the system packages alone, as one should do with python and have venvs for each project.
 What happend most often is that eglot/pylsp did not recognize the installed packages in the venvs, I tried to install pylsp in one "general" venv, I it worked well, untill I realized that I did not have the projects in enviroments (I had created several accidentally with poetry and venvwrapper at the same time, and neither of those where active when developing), and the dependencies where a mess as result.
 So I ask in general what would be the best practice to keep things clean?, and in more detail:
  
where to install the lsp and other IDE packages,
 how to make emacs aware of the enviroments to manage them, 
 know what enviroment I'm in, 
 be able to change enviroment,
 install packages to the enviroment.
 
 How to make eglot understand that the project has its own enviroment and should recognise the installed packages in the enviroment?

I initially "got stuck" when introduced to foldings and pointfree notation).
 I think I now have a somewhat solid understanding of the basics (Though I assume there are a plethora of useful functions I still don't know about.

 I'm using the scala kubernetes-client https://github.com/joan38/kubernetes-client to work with k8s. The k8s resource class is mostly made up of Option types, is there a more concise and safe way to approach this instead of calling getOrElse or flatMap every time to do deep exploration?
 Below is my code Note that the flatMap continues to be added and the indent deepens to find the ImagePullBackOff pod. 
 for { pods <- c.pods.namespace("alpha").list().map(_.items) deployNames <- pods .collect { pod => pod.status.flatMap { status => status.containerStatuses .flatMap( _.find( _.state.exists(x => x.waiting.isDefined && x.waiting.get.reason.get .contains("ImagePullBackOff") ) ) ) .map(_ => f"${pod.metadata.get.labels.get.get("app").get}-${pod.metadata.get.labels.get.get("env").get}" ) } } 
 Is there a more concise way to approach this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm just learning haskell, and I'm trying to add an external package for pretty much the first time. I wanted something to parse s-expressions, so I searched for that and came across this package (and basically nothing else): https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sexp-0.7
 I wanted to use this package, so I added it to my .cabal file (I'm using cabal-install), ran cabal update, and tried to build my program. After trying to build the package for some time, I got an error:
 src/Data/Sexp.hs:4:14: warning: [-Wdeprecated-flags] -XOverlappingInstances is deprecated: instead use per-instance pragmas OVERLAPPING/OVERLAPPABLE/OVERLAPS | 4 | {-# LANGUAGE OverlappingInstances, ViewPatterns #-} | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [1 of 4] Compiling Data.Sexp ( src/Data/Sexp.hs, dist/build/Data/Sexp.o, dist/build/Data/Sexp.dyn_o ) src/Data/Sexp.hs:200:25: error: [GHC-76037] Not in scope: type constructor or class ‘NoSelector’ Suggested fix: Perhaps use ‘Selector’ (imported from GHC.Generics) | 200 | instance IsRecord (M1 S NoSelector f) False | ^^^^^^^^^^ Error: cabal: Failed to build sexp-0.7 (which is required by exe:sexp from sexp-0.7). See the build log above for details. 
 More important than this particular error, I'm just trying to figure out if I'm doing the right thing. Can you just find a package on hackage and install it, or do you have to check for compatibility first? In this case, the package hasn't been updated in 7 years, but I was unable to learn that from hackage--I had to go look at its github page. I'm guessing the age is a problem, but I just don't have a sense of how to find packages and determine whether they'll be compatible with my setup.
 For reference, I'm running ghc version 9.6.5 in a nix develop shell. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is pretty trivial, but as someone starting out learning Haskell and with very little coding experience in general, I thought I'd share this solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem in the CIS194 homework. I just had that "aha" moment with functional programming working on this when I realized what "defining" vs "doing" really means. To be clear, when I say "defining" I mean saying what a value is, as opposed to "doing", that is, going through the computational steps, procedural style. Anyway, here's my solution.
 type Peg = String type Move = (Peg, Peg) hanoi :: Integer -> Peg -> Peg -> Peg -> [Move] hanoi 0 _ _ _ = [] hanoi 1 a b _ = [(a, b)] hanoi x start goal temp = hanoi (x - 1) start temp goal ++ (start, goal) : hanoi (x - 1) temp goal start 
 I'm sure there are problems with my solution, and this definitely isn't something that would be difficult to implement in a procedural style, but when I was first attempting this problem I was creating structures to keep track of where each disc was and what the size of each disc was, and seeing this solution I just got really excited, so I thought I'd share it :) thanks for reading all this if you did btw

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a little bit of background, I'm working on a language for doing first order logic. The ast is just an instance of a pretty big recursive data type.
 While developing the language, I've ended up needing to write a bunch of functions that all boil down to recursively modifying a couple of the constructors, while leaving the rest untouched. (Eg, turning every "Implies a b" into "Or (Not a) b" while leaving everything else untouched).
 Not every constructor has the same shape, so there isn't an easy way to use wildcards while keeping the function recursive, and so to avoid writing a bunch of nearly identical recursive calls (elimImp (Not a) = Not (elimImp a)) for every function, I wrote an operator Ive been calling $$ that threads a function through every recursive constructor, and then elimImp can just be a case statement that only does its job, and then is the identity otherwise, and doesnt have to worry about keeping the recursion going. 
 This thingy, $$, isn't exactly map, and isn't exactly apply, even though it's clearly similar to both. I am assuming it's a fairly common operation to perform on recursive data structures, but I don't know what I would be called. What exactly have I written? I'm actively trying to learn the basics of type/category theory, so please don't shy away from details!!

Emacs
 Emacs (Client)
  
That's fine, I understand why they're there. But since then, I installed the algebraic geometry software Macaulay2 with
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:macaulay2/macaulay2 sudo apt install macaulay2 
 I noticed that some stuff related to Emacs seemed to be installed along with this program. Now, when I type "emacs" in the search, I see
  
Emacs
 Emacs (Client)
 Emacs (GUI)
 Emacs (Terminal)
 Emacs (Client)
  
I don't like that. I've been learning how to use Emacs for the past week and I want to keep it as simple as possible. What's going on, do I have multiple Emacs versions installed in my system? When I do apt list -a emacs it only returns
 emacs/noble,now 1:29.3+1-1ubuntu2 all [installed,automatic] 
 How do I go back to how it was before?
 Any help is appreciated.

 Could you share with me yours copy paste workflow.
 Here is my workflow:
 I select half of the first line and push the M-w to copy this half line.
 I select half of the second line and my plan is to change it with the previously copied text.
 So I select the half of the second line and I push the yank-pop related shortcut and I use the arrow key to go down to the second line and push the enter key to copy the previously copied text to this place.
 What is yours workflow for this simple text manipulation ?
 Do you have an elisp code what is changing this basic behavior (to copy the region before the paste) ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a /very/ long time happy user of eight megs and constantly swapping, but recenty, I wonder if there has been a trend upward in latency.
 I use it exclusively for programming python, so jedi-LSP. or pyright with eglot, with minimal fancy extensions.
 But it just feels sluggish; this on a modern Intel MBP and also M2 MBP. 
 I wonder if I am imagining things, or if folks are tracking latency and have numbers to back me up / shoot me down. 
 By latency, I mean simple scrolling, cursor movement; when I invoke cross-ref operations I expect some latency just to open new buffer, so that isn't important. 
 As an eaxmple, I think my C-n move-next-line speed is +- 5 lines per second, and Zed on the same machine, same codebase is +- 20.

📢 We are excited to announce ScalikeJDBC 4.3, introducing a new OR mapper named scalikejdbc-orm!
 If you're a fan of ActiveRecord from Rails, this will surely appeal to you!
 Check the document now: https://scalikejdbc.org/documentation/orm.html #Scala #Database #ActiveRecord
  
The release notes https://github.com/scalikejdbc/scalikejdbc/blob/master/notes/4.3.0.markdown
  
ScalikeJDBC 4.3.0 is now available for Scala 2.12, 2.13, and Scala 3 application development!
 The notable feature enhancement is scalikejdbc-orm module addition! This extension is an O/R mapper built on top of the ScalikeJDBC core library, drawing significant inspiration from Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord library. For instance, you can run the following query just with simple CRUDMapper class/object definition:
 ...
 Thank you to all the contributors for this release! 👍
 * u/jchyb helped u/seratch resolve Scala 3 compilation errors for scalikejdbc-orm module (#1249)
 * u/kardapoltsev resolved missing tags in one-to-x queries (#2163)
 * u/xuwei-k did a substantial amount of work for refactoring and dependency management
  
What is ScalikeJDBC ?
  
This library seamlessly wraps JDBC APIs, offering intuitive and highly flexible functionalities. With QueryDSL, your code becomes inherently type-safe and reusable.
 ScalikeJDBC is not just practical; it’s production-ready. Utilize this library confidently in your real-world projects.
