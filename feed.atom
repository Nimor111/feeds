 Can a database use ODBC to access emacs orgmode tables?
 ChatGPT
 Yes, it is possible for a database to use ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) to access tables stored in the Emacs org-mode format. ODBC is a standard application programming interface (API) that provides a way for database management systems to access and manipulate data stored in other database management systems. It allows a database to connect to and query data stored in other databases using SQL, regardless of the underlying database management s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon folks! I'm Tracy, from Ontario, Canada.
I've been slowly familiarizing myself with some of the zettel intros, posts, and concepts, while also trying to be realistic and conscious about the way my brain works and what will be a sustainable habit to introduce into my existing notes system. Currently, my notes span across academia, professional work, personal stuff, grocery lists, conceptual ideas, project sketches/outlines, and even video game progress plans.
These notes are captured in Zotero attachments, paper bullet journals, google docs, iOS Notes App, liquidtext pdf editor, the reminders app... I don't think I'll be able to so cleanly bundle everything into one tool, but I like the idea of taking the things that really engage and interest me and giving them their own space in the archive so I can make cross-disciplinary connections or revelations!
I am afflicted with the "it needs to be perfect" to start with, and something I've been working on is just doing something "poorly" or "haphazardly" to get that attitude out of the way. My first zettel in the archive software was just me testing the archive syntax (which is new to me) and reflecting on how it feels with my style of note-taking.
Anyways, looking forward to learning more about zettelkasten, knowledge practices, my own brain processes, and the challenge of sorting, retaining, releasing, and integrating knowledge in a way that is helpful to my own goals]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not going to start flooding the sub with chatbot posts, but ChatGPT managed to output a functional program (discounting some empty lists) for grouping and sorting text:
  
 write a haskell program to process text into groups and sort based on the first letter of the line
  
Here is a simple Haskell program that processes text into groups and sorts each group based on the first letter of each line:
 import Data.Char import Data.List -- This function takes a string of text and returns a list of groups, where -- each group is a list of lines that start with the same letter. The groups -- are sorted alphabetically based on the first letter of each line. processText :: String -> [[String]] processText text = -- First, we split the text into a list of lines let lines = lines text -- Next, we group the lines by their first letter grouped = groupBy (\x y -> (toLower . head) x == (toLower . head) y) lines -- Finally, we sort the groups alphabetically by their first letter sorted = sortBy (\x y -> (toLower . head . head) x < (toLower . head . head) y) grouped in sorted -- This is an example of how to use the processText function main :: IO () main = do let text = "hello\nworld\napple\nbanana\ncat\ndog" let groups = processText text putStrLn $ show groups 
 The output of this program when run on the example text given in the main function would be:
 [["apple"], ["banana"], ["cat"], ["dog"], ["hello", "world"]] 
  
Needed some minor cleanup to compile: sortBy takes an a -> a -> Ordering, not a a -> a -> Bool, and the lines variable name needed changing to not match the function. Once complete, it compiles and functions more or less as expected. I could spot the head would likely give trouble on empty lists (which it did) and that groupBy could produce some strange groupings, but wild to see the skeleton of a decent sort function produced so easily. Like AI art, this could be pretty useful for brainstorming, if the results aren't outright useful themselves.

 HOWEVER, is there any sort of interop library that would allow one to program IN Common Lisp to extend emacs? I would think such an interop system would allow one to interact with Emacs' buffer functionality in particular. 
 I'm not really sure that such a thing is very practical or would interest many people. But I recently wrote a Python interop library that allows me to use Python libraries from within Common Lisp, and I found it really helped my own understanding of Lisp quite a bit. 
 I'm just wondering if anything like that has been done. So far, my google searches don't reveal much.

 I'm in a buffer in a directory and I want to find all the files matching a pattern at or below the current directory. What is a simple (or perhaps the simplest) way to get that list?
 What I do now is switch to a terminal (outside of emacs) and using zsh I do print -l **/*-ts-*.el (or whatever pattern I'm looking for). It seems very likely that there is a simpler way to do this from within Emacs. I'm open to loading more applications on my laptop if that would help. This need seems to come up with me very often.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Atom has shut down. I could probably still use it, but for permanence I decided to switch to Emacs since I'm extremely picky with my editors. 
 To be honest, the first time I tried it I was disappointed how hard it was do something simple as save a file, copy/paste and whatnot. However, the "steep learning curve" everyone talks about is just a matter of having a nanosecond of patience. Then speed comes later. What I love about the keybindings is it confines all of my work to the keyboard and the bindings are ergonomic if you also use the right Ctrl and shift keys. My workflow is honestly magnitudes better, being able to jump at lightning speed, completely neglecting arrow keys and the mouse. Also, for the first time ever, I am using all ten fingers to type. 
 The question: I've set up a theme which I like, auto pairing brackets, indent and auto-complete. Curious if there's a way to get linting support? i.e. underlining missing semicolons, typos. 
 Also, can I integrate a terminal into emacs as well? So far having the screen split with emacs and terminal (GNOME on Ubuntu) is working fine, but wondering if there's an even better way. 
 Thanks.

 Like this example:
 example1 :: [Int] -> Maybe Int example1 = reverse >>> findIndex (== 5) >>> fmap (* 2) 
 When working with functors, I often have >>> fmap . Is there an operator which combines the two?
 But for monads, I can't even do that:
 example2 :: [Int] -> Maybe Int example2 = reverse >>> findIndex (== 5) >>> possiblyFailing where possiblyFailing x = x >>= Just . (* 2) 
 I'm pretty sure that there are idiomatic ways to both of the cases, but I'm just not able to find them 😅

 I've been searching for some time to see if this is even possible in Org mode. It's so simple and hard to describe in searching that I've come up with nothing and it remains something that is keeping me from going all in on Org.
 Is there no way to promote a field of text in Org without a heading marker?
  
In the attached screenshot, I want the text with the arrow ("Promote this text...") to be promoted out of this double Subtree block to reside at the same level of text as if it were under History.
 "text here" should remain under Subtree.
  
Can this not be done or am I missing something simple?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it possible to refer to, or link to, a header in another org file? I'm thinking I may have to read up on org-agenda. 
 I keep a personal journal, and at this point, it's almost a thousand small markdown files no larger than 4k - one for (almost) each day. I refer to each one just simply by linking to the <date>.md and then make my journal entry there. 
 On the upside, I can check what I did this day a year, two year, etc ago by doing "ls *-12-06.md".. but on the other hand, it's really inefficient. 
 I was wondering if it would be more efficient to make an org file for each year and then have header lines for each day, plus additional ones for each topic underneath. I'd like to be able to link from another org file (say a project, or a movie review) and put a date on there and be able to pull up what I was doing that day.
 Any strategies for doing that in org/emacs?

So far I managed to do the first 4 challenges simply by putting them in different directories and using ghci or runhaskell to execute them. As the point of this is learning the language, I don't want to use any libraries not included in base, I'm implementing functions like split or chunks by myself, but including the implementations of these functions in every single challenge solution doesn't seem like a good idea. I'm not sure if Cabal would be a good idea because the project would consist of 25 separate solutions and 25 input files and I'm not sure how would that go. What is the best way to handle this kind of situation?

In the second case, fib' is redefined for every argument x. The compiler cannot know whether you intended this -- while it increases time complexity it may reduce space complexity. Thus it will not float the definition out from under the binding of x.
 In contrast, in the first function, fib' can be moved to the top level by the compiler. The where clause hid this structure and made the application to x look like a plain eta expansion, which it is not. 
  
I cannot really understand how the compiler optimized the first definition of the function and not the second, apparently the redefinition of the function has an impact on time complexity.
 I know that a big part of FP optimization comes to know how to dance with the compiler, it's patterns and to lay stuff out for it to make "better". But unlike tail recursion, this trick doesn't seem as clear to me.
 I'd be most grateful for a clarification on how this works for a beginner haskeller, thanks :-).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have just moved to a macbook and I am already enjoying emacs even more than under WSL. But unfortunately, now the tab key sometimes stops working for emacs GUI. It is not even registered as a keypress: 'C-h c <tab>' just ignores the <tab> keypress. C-i is recognized as a tab press, and in the terminal things seem to work normally.
 I am on Monterey 12.5, emacsplus@28, using a doom config. I tried to find help online but so far was unsuccessful. I have disabled mission control key bindings, including the use of tab to shift focus, but it still seems to happen. Did somebody solve a similar problem? Does it have to do with the shell from which the emacs GUI is started? It might also be something basic about macOs, with which I am completely inexperienced. Thank you for any ideas how to find out what is happening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was watching this video from Cal Newport's podcast where he briefly mentions Zettelkasten. The video is about how he uses a simple marking system while reading and how it makes note taking unnecessary for a professional writer. His definition of the Zettelkasten method is something like take notes on everything you read, regardless if it is relevant to your current project. As an example he gives Ryan Holiday. We know that is a poor definition of a Zettelkasten and Ryan is not a good example either. He takes copious notes, but there is no linking in his system. While I don't agree with his characterization of the Zettelkasten, I think it is true that some people use it that way.
Anyway, my point is not to complain about his characterization of the Zettelkasten, he mentioned another thing…]]></summary>

 Hey, I'm working on a watched movie list for myself (prepping for 2023). One of my hobbies is watching movies (I watch maybe 100-200+ a year - yes that's 2 movies a week, sometimes more! I don't have cable and don't watch much TV outside those times) and I like to track what I've already watched. I had one set-up in Obsidian, but one thing I didn't like was the lack of portability (Dataview can only be read within Obsidian). So , I was wondering if I could replicate this in Emacs Org-mode. 
 Here's an example - 1st is from Obsidian, 2nd is from Emacs. 
 Is there a way to have it automatically wrap at a certain width? 
 I'm aware of M-RET M-RET, but I'd like a more automatic way of doing this, so I can see about typing in my comments a little quicker. For example:
 | IMDB | [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13533944][tt13533944]] | | Watched | 2022-11-19 | | Genre | Horror | | Comment | It was okay. It's a "folk horror" and it does pretty well for that. I did enjoy the different "scenery" since the movie was filmed in | | | Ireland. | | Released | 10 Nov 2022 | | | | 
 Also, is it possible to render an image inside a table cell or column? 
 And finally, I was thinking of attaching a movie cover to each "movie" header but then, how do I reference the attachment into an inline image?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi People!
I'm an geosciences investigator based in Santiago, Chile.
I found about Zettelkasten a few weeks ago while navigating Wikipedia on Systems Theory -> Niklas Luhman.
It was nice to know about it and got me really excited about the possibilities.
I try to apply systemic thinking on my research, complex systems and stuff, which is really interesting for me but also gave me an (pretty bad) information overload a few years ago. Complex systems theory allows you to see links between disciplines, which also can make hard to focus on one thing at a time.
I struggled through my endless master thesis process. It got me sick for real. Concentrating was sometimes impossible even for whole weeks. Gracefully I ended it well a few months ago and now I'm a researcher, in the meantime I prepare myself for doing my phd (hopefully 2024 in Berlin).
With renovated energies, I'm gradually managing to find a new flow for my work and personal life. A really important part is to develop a workflow, combining project management, journaling, synchronization/backing between home and work devices, code software integration.
I use to take notes by hand in a notebook. I have several of them filled with research logs, scientific articles notes, theory notes, ideas, day/week journals. I tried (space)emacs and org-mode a couple of years ago, learned the basics to left it completely a month later.
Now I decided to base my workflow on digital notes. I've sneak into doom emacs with org-roam, obsidian and vscode with dendron.
I'm inclining in favor of having a note-taking workflow integrated with vscode instead of emacs, as I program in vscode.
Since deciding on digital note-taking systems choice paradox led to paralysis analysis. But today I finally started with a weakly planner on markdown, in any case it will be not worse than writing it on a physical notebook that will be forgotten.
Thanks for maintaining this nice community.
All the best

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my research so far for database libraries I want to use with SQLite.
  
Serialization/deserialization over raw SQL queries 
 sqlite-simple
 
 Query builders 
 Persistent + Esqueleto // Get used to template haskell.
 Beam // This doesn't use template haskell. This has the most SQL features, but can also be more verbose and seemingly more complex than other options.
 Selda // This looks simpler than beam.
 
  
Should database(data & schema) migration be included from the beginning? Or, can it be bolted onto my application later?
 Which ones are going to be the best for a relatively simple SQLite application in the long term? I'm going to need basic JOINs and basic CRUD operations with probably less than 20 tables. I want to minimize maintenance in the long term like 30 ~ 50 years. Churning is not desirable. I want to write it once and not have to worry about replacing a database library later for as long as I use my application while I'm alive. Most open-source projects are maintained by less than 3 people, so I can't expect other people to keep up with library churning.
 For terminal UI, I chose brick because brick seems good and extremely well maintained although it's mostly a one-man show. It seems brick may outlast the usefulness of my application. The man behind brick must be a vigorous guy who grew up with proper nutrition because I have never seen a better maintained open-source project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to keep notes about using Ruby in an .org file. When it comes to simple repetitions working well in Ruby's irb, e.g.
  irb(main):038:1* 3.times do irb(main):039:1* puts "greetings" irb(main):040:0> end greetings greetings greetings => 3 
 my assumption was I simply could use a fenced snippet of code such as
 ``` #+begin_src ruby :results code :exports both 3.times do puts "greetings" end #+end_src
 #+RESULTS: #+begin_src ruby 3 #+end_src ```
 however instead of the anticipated greetings, it is the return value 3 which shows up. By my configuration file, babel is aware about ruby, and C-c ' opens the box; there equally is syntax highlighting. Is there an additional parameter to be adjusted to get greetings shown thrice as in the irb?

I’ll do some advent of code problems in a lisp and things seem to go well but as soon as I get stuck it feels impossible to find a solution that makes any sense. In terms of elisp I’ll write simple functions but when digging into plug-in source code feel like there is no amount of study that could make me competent in the language. Is this just the start of the valley of imposter syndrome where you know enough to know what you’re ignorant about or the inability to make the paradigm shift to thinking in a “lispy / function” way? Not meaning to rant just curious how people broke through this barrier if anyone has felt the same.

learning #memory
It is not clear how to operationalize memory [[202211150901]] and thus how exactly to best use how memory works.
Clearly, there are good and bad methods of learning. For an exam, merely repeating the material is inferior to active questioning. Repetition trains recall, while active questioning trains the very behavior of being able to give answers to questions that is required in exams.
Perhaps this results in a hierarchy of learning methods?
Thesis: You should start with simple memory techniques and then work your way up to more complex ones.
Repetition
Active retrieval
Comprehension
Comment: This was part of the last note.
Thanks to the feedback, I have separated the two knowledge modules:
the problem of operationalization
the method inspired by the problem (still undeveloped).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw a demo over at EmacsConf that is related to tree-sitter and the presenter showed a helm chart file and showed fancy-narrow with it.
 If there is one format that I often use, it's helm chart files and they can be quite frustrating to edit; the error messages can be somewhat obscure at times, too, so any help I could get from Emacs would be fantastic. Even getting the indentation right can be really troublesome. I'm not sure if there is a good way to have Helm's extra syntax be handled better than yaml-mode seems to do.
 I installed the emacs-plus@29 on a Mac, and it seems to have some tree-sitter support in core, but it seems yaml support might not be there? Anyone else have tips on build(s) to use that might have this in there? From some of the activity it seemed it might be in the works; maybe nightly builds are needed to pick this up?

 edit: sorry, I think I should add that I'm using spacemacs and the config was added to my user-config section
 Every time I start emacs up, it recompiles the EmacSQL SQLite binary- it takes 20s every time, and it started doing that as I started to setup Org-roam. 
 Why? And can I improve this? 
 Relevant config:
  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/Notes/org-roam/")) :bind (("C-c n l" . org-roam-buffer-toggle) ("C-c n f" . org-roam-node-find) ("C-c n g" . org-roam-graph) ("C-c n i" . org-roam-node-insert) ("C-c n c" . org-roam-capture) ;; Dailies ("C-c n j" . org-roam-dailies-capture-today)) :config (org-roam-db-autosync-mode) ) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'toggle-word-wrap) 
 edit: I've commented out the relevant config for now - it starts up in 1.5s which seems more reasonable.

 First, native compilation comes in two modes: synchronous and asynchronous. I was getting the error when the file was being compiled asynchronously.
 It turns out that I'm using leaf where leaf is a macro. Asynchronous starts fresh and so it doesn't know that leaf is a macro and gets confused. So the remedy is to (eval-when-compile (require 'leaf)) at the top of the file.
 TL; DR -- the error above (with a file path and nothing after the proper-list-p is most likely an undefined macro hit during asynchronous compilation.

It could still be nice to attend something like a conference to learn some new skills and meet people.
 Does anyone know of conferences about Haskell or functional programming that are accessible for amateurs like me? Are you an amateur who has attended a conference? I'm curious to hear your thoughts and experiences.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heya!
 Few days ago in an earlier thread I asked about any existing package for working with age encrypted files. Few folks pointed me in the right direction so I started working on this at https://codeberg.org/sochotnicky/age-mode
 The package is... experimental. There are a few known bugs (and many unknown I am sure). But things work in happy-path scenarios when you have correct identities defined and whatnot.
 I mostly copied over things from EPA package and adjusted for GPG->age differences (fortunately age is much simpler to work with). So when things are set up right you can get transparent age file decryption on file open and encryption on save. There's a few other accessory functions as well.
 Package needs some refactoring, more documentation, better error handling, support for different ways to specify recipients/identities, figuring out why editing over TRAMP saves unencrypted files and more. If someone feels like helping out I'd be happy to accept patches :-)
 I haven't really done that much elisp coding, but I've enjoyed the process so far. I am mostly just scratching my own itch here but who knows, it might help someone else...

 Flint is a YC company that's on a mission to fix American Healthcare by solving the nursing shortage crisis. We do this by removing barriers for international nurses to immigrate and build a career in the United States, and we are on track to help 1,000+ nurses immigrate by the end of next year (2023).
 We are growing quickly, and we need people to help us lay the foundation for our global healthcare workforce product. Our code is still young and you'd have a chance to leave your mark on the architecture.
 We're a distributed team and are considering candidates in the NA, SA, EMEA regions.
 If you're interested in this role, please apply here. Feel free to read more about our culture. You can also direct any questions to [wonchan@withflint.com](mailto:wonchan@withflint.com), thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to ask experienced emacs users on macos what their distro of choice is in late 2022. As a vimmer interested in emacs due to the vast customization capabilities and especially org-mode, I looked into trying it out for myself. It seemed as though the easiest way to get an idea of the potential of emacs was to install doom. I used the official guides on the repo and tried out both emacs-mac and emacs-plus with native comp. On my M1 macbook pro I experienced major cursor lag (when navigating through text files using vim bindings), they were so severe especially after coming from vim that i ended up removing doom entirely. Vanilla emacs didnt feel a 100% smooth either. Whats even weirder is that weeks after uninstalling emacs itself my computer still had a process running called emacs with 99% cpu useage and high gpu useage. After doing some digging, it seems that there are rendering issues on retina displays specifically that really mess up the responsiveness of the app. I read about different things to try such as using fira code as the font, changing the line highlighting behavior etc.
 ​
 Anyways, Before trying to fix something that seemed broken I want to try to install another build again, and I'd also be comfortable with vanilla emacs and configuring it on my own if it means stable performance. So what I want to know specifically is the following:
 In your opinion what are reliable distros and build options out of the following distros for M1 on a retina display in terms of responsiveness and light cpu/gpu useage?
 - emacs-mac
 - emacs-plus
 - emacsformacosx
 and would you ppl suggest with native comp or without?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Haskell FFI does not support directly passing structs in function definitions, but there is a way around it:
 Say foo and baz are structs. Given a function with signature
 bar fun1 (foo a, int b); 
 We can define a conversion that uses pointers instead:
 void wrapper (foo *a, int b, bar *out) { out* = (*a, b); } 
 Now say we have a different function defined as
 typedef bar (*cb) (foo a, int b); void fun2 (cb callback); 
 cb here can't be marshalled, just like fun1 in the first example, but now we need to wrap in the opposite direction: whatever C function we create has to input typedef bar* (*wrapped) (foo* a, int b) and output cb. This appears to be quite a non-trivial task within C. Is there a simpler solution to this I'm missing?

Though using all ten fingers to touch type, I notice the frequent use of the (left) control key to initiate/complete command chords strains my pinky; perhaps especially on a Thinkpad where the position of function key and Ctr are switched.
 While there are instructions how to remap C to an other key accessible with less crawl of the hand, I wonder: was remapping the function of the control key to an other key (e.g., caps lock) a technique frequently used prior to the advent of orgmode?

 I'm guessing the process would be; use Ubuntu Software to uninstall current Emacs, (perhaps delete the elpa Org directory and contents), then reinstall Emacs either using Ubuntu Software, or by sudo apt install.
 Any thoughts or recommendations much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tweaking emacs with satisfication is not easy, but I am trying to think how it would work efficiently. The problem of the naive emacs keybindings is that it over relies on the ctrl key, default layout of modern computer keyboard makes it effort-some to do navigation. In my opinion, the alt (or meta) key should be paid more attention as we can balance between those two kinds.
 The first thing I found is that using arrow keys to navigate is fine, but not efficient, as its up and down arrow is not so coherent, and most of times we need rely on the thumb to hit the keys separately. While ctrl-n and ctrl-p can be an alternative to move around between lines, the same as alt-n and alt-p, for which I would suggest that using it as forward-paragraph and backward-paragraph. It can be smoother as oppose to the ctrl-<down> and ctrl-<up>, in the mean time, you can utilize the other combinations such as alt-f, alt-b to move forward word or backward. In that sense, alt key becomes a bold version of ctrl key, since it jumps fast and corresponds to every navigation key that ctrl has. We can therefore switch between those two modifier keys to move in a small pace or in a larger pace without intervening the arrow keys. At the same time, we can assign more combinations to the prefix key alt-s corresponding the ctrl-x. If we can stay mostly at the left region, the keystroke would be more efficient. If we can utilize those two kinds to the best, we can balance the left and right region, such as buffer navigation uses right hand-side alt-[ and alt-], and buffer switch uses alt-\.
 I also want to listen to your suggestions, as I believe everyone has their own opinions and configurations to make a balance, not be overloaded, while be efficient.
 Edit: I have remapped caps to ctrl.

 I have been maintaining the official Haskell docker images for about 2 years now. I have tried to push the project forward in various ways and I’m pleased with where they are now.
 There is more work to be done, such as Alpine and Windows support (both almost done, but blocked on GHC issues or need a final push).
 Unfortunately, I don’t have much time anymore for anything other than basic maintenance. Most of my time is taken up by my day job and my 8 month old. I also no longer work in Haskell, which lowers my motivation. I’d like to hand off maintenance, ideally to multiple new maintainers.
 Is anyone interested? If so, you can post here or on this github issue.

So if you're using Fourmolu and want to upgrade to GHC 9.4, wait no more! Also includes some quality of life improvements like not considering the leading space in a -- comment as part of the comment, and allowing multiline docs to be styled differently for modules than for functions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I'm brand new to Haskell, diving in for the first time using advent of code as an excuse to try and learn the language. I'm trying to go out of my way to "play", to get a better sense of how the language works. I don't think the specific problem is important in this case, but I have run into some counter-intuitive behavior. 
 My code reads inputs from a file, then does some simple computation (parse String -> Tuple, then "score" that tuple which is just Tuple -> Integer). Then I want to sum the scores. I first did this with a sum and a map, but then realized I could do it in a single fold. Code like this:
 main :: IO () main = do contents <- readFile "input02t" let input = lines contents -- This takes ~2 seconds to run print $ sum $ map (score . readEntry) input -- Same answer, but this takes ~10 seconds to run print $ foldr ((+) . score . readEntry) 0 input 
 The time difference shocked me, because I expected equivalence. Is there a reason the fold takes so much longer than sum + map?

 Now, what do I have in the dot emacs file? Here is the snippet, which kicks in while emacs initialize...FYI 
 (setq org2blog/wp-image-upload t)
 ..and it is not helping the cause. Most of my recent ( year or so) have written with it and none of them contain any media file. If those have, then I must go to the website and upload it manually. This is exactly what I want to bypass. 
 ​
 Am I missing the obvious?? Oh, what did I do to get it along with the text? This is the exact step I follow, on the blog body ....
 [[ file ~/some_arbitrary_image_file_name]] 
 I am sure, emacs told me something when it failed to upload the image along with blogs and I can't get it from the top of my head right now.
 PS: I can embed video url with no problem whatsoever and it works bloody well. 
 ​
 ..and those of you inclined to help me, I might point you to my frivolous dot emacs file, you might glean on it ,if it has some violation of the specific part . 
 Here it is for your perusal: Dot emacs file for your information

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After experiencing how unholistic it feels configuring and extending VS Code, I started doing my research. I've tried Vim and Neovim more which has a fractured community. I question Vim's perceived efficiency with its keybindings and modal workflow but know it is universally available and quick to load.
 Testing Emacs for the first time opened my eyes and challenged what I thought I ever knew about it. The wealth of its built-in package manager with repos and extensibility is incredible. I thought it was all terminal focused but found out about the GUI and that a large majority of the community is using it. Now I am comfortable in the terminal but far from elite and have never tried a full terminal workflow. I'd like to hear from professional programmers and admins. What is your preferred choice?
 I want to know and grok the possibilities of using an editor inside a terminal, do you have more functionality, are you able to pipe things easier, etc. I know the benefits of the GUI in graphics and keybindings but is there feature loss or pain points when using something like vterm. Emacs is very flexible and there is many, many ways to complete work.
 In your opinion, should a person that wants to be the best programmer and admin possible focus on using GUI or Terminal Emacs? Thanks a million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a bit at a loss. I'm not that great with lisp and have been going through documentation for hours now.
 I saw that use-package supports directly customizing fonts through :custom-face which i would like to use to change some centaur tabs fonts. Before i did this "manually" with set-face-attribute. So far, i'm not getting errors, but my font also isn't getting applied. Additionally it seems things like :weight don't work here. So, could someone explain to me how this is done correctly?
 My current setup:
 (defvar PropFont) (setq PropFont "Inter") (use-package centaur-tabs :demand :straight t :init (centaur-tabs-mode t) :bind ("C-<prior>" . centaur-tabs-backward) ("C-<next>" . centaur-tabs-forward) :config (setq centaur-tabs-set-icons t) :custom (set-face-attribute 'centaur-tabs-selected-modified nil :family PropFont :weight 'bold :slant 'italic) (set-face-attribute 'centaur-tabs-unselected-modified nil :family PropFont :weight 'normal :slant 'italic) :custom-face (centaur-tabs-active-bar-face ((t (:family PropFont)))) (centaur-tabs-default ((t (:family PropFont)))) (centaur-tabs-selected ((t (:family PropFont)))) (centaur-tabs-unselected ((t (:family PropFont))))) 
 If you need more context i can put my entire init on pastebin or such, but this is all that's centaur tabs related.
 Any hint on what i'm doing wrong would be awesome.

What I'm looking for is basic IDE features (completion, inline error messages, docs on hover, etc), a REPL, and/or a debugger. Most people seem to recommend emacs, vim, or VS Code as their editor for Haskell. I'm not interested in using emacs or vim, so VS Code it is.
 I followed the recommendations on haskell.org and installed GHCup, and then using that installed GHC, cabal, stack, and the haskell language server, and then I installed the Haskell extension for VS Code. Then I noticed that extension doesn't seem to have a REPL or support for debugging, so I also installed the Haskell GHCi Debug Adapter extension. So far, so good, but I just couldn't get it to actuall…]]></summary>

 Example, js-indent-level value is 4. Eglot overwrite those 4 spaces with 1 <tab> making the indentation 8 spaces wide, which is Emacs default size.
 An option would be to set the default tab-size to 4. But I would rather having Eglot just using the indentation step defined in major-mode.
 Is there an option for this? I can't seem to find it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: I am relatively new to Emacs, and in org-mode in particular. Just this week I started using org-mode to prepare my papers, assignments, laboratory reports, etc. My only trouble is the exported tables to PDF.
 If the table have three columns with just short entries, I have no problem. But when the entries inside the table is long, the table extends to the right (outside the margin) of the page.
 Example:
 | Sequence | Score | Position | Remarks | |----------------------+-------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------| | TGCCGGCACCACCGCGTGTA | 97 | 1258 | This is a long text describing this sequence and another text here | | CGCGTGTAGGGCGGAGTAAA | 89 | 856 | Another long text in this second row of table | | CGGCACCACCGCGTGTAGGG | 91 | 21 | Another remark | 
 In the header I have this:
 #+title: Sample Paper in Org #+subtitle: Paper Presentation #+author: Some One #+latex_header: \usepackage[a4paper,text={6.25in,9in}, truedimen]{geometry} 
 I tried reading the org-mode manual but I couldn't figure it out how to make my table look nice.
 I did something like this:
 #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment tabu | Sequence | Score | Position | Remarks | |----------------------+-------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------| | TGCCGGCACCACCGCGTGTA | 97 | 1258 | This is a long text describing this sequence and another text here | | CGCGTGTAGGGCGGAGTAAA | 89 | 856 | Another long text in this second row of table | | CGGCACCACCGCGTGTAGGG | 91 | 21 | Another remark | 
 and in the header I add: #+latex_header: \usepackage{tabu}.
 The result is the same:

 Is there any way how can I fix this?

 EDIT: I invoke the M-x org-pandoc-export-to-latex-pdf keybindings to generate the PDF.
 EDIT: By the way, I am using Doom Emacs.

 After marking DONE, I archive the task/projects to a single archive2022.org file. My main objective for maintaining an archive is for generating clocktables and analyze time spent with each customer, which task/projects took me the most time, etc., and eventually bill that time.

 I mostly-get some of the basic big ideas: make invalid states un-representable, e.g. Use a type that encodes your constraints in some way (like NonEmpty!). I found lots of good advice in this blog post, and several others by the same author. (I tried to put it to work in my own code, restricting the domain of a finicky function, which felt like a nice, if small, win.)
 Anyway, I feel like I'm still only scratching the surface. Reading posts like this or the "types" section in the "State of the Haskell ecosystem" gets me really excited, but doesn't leave me with much in the way of practical advice.
 Are there are good/recommended resources for digging deeper into this kind of stuff? I stumbled across Thinking with Types today, which seems like it could be a good fit. I also see there's a chapter on "Basic Type Level Programming" in Production Haskell. I've also found various blogs and reddit posts, of course, but nothing super-comprehensive. (And "Type-driven development" sounds cool, but I'm not ready to branch into Idris yet.)
 I'd love any recommendations, pointers, tips-and-tricks... whatever you've got to offer! Thanks!
 ​
 \Any feedback is welcome, by the way, if anybody feels like digging through beginner code. It feels weird to work/learn in a vacuum. Looking at it now I already see some deficiencies, but I'm sure there are plenty that I don't see...*

 I've looked around but so far haven't found any package that would provide support for working with Age-encrypted files: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age
 I am strongly considering just writing some helper methods etc. I see some potential problems. For example ideally I'd love to have an editing support where I open age encrypted file, it gets unencrypted in the buffer and reencrypted on save, but not sure it is possible to easily re-encrypt file to the same recipients (without hardcoding a list in code/variable)
 Anyway - thought I'd ask if there's anything that already exists by any chance and I just missed it (age is not exactly a searchable term).

 import Data.Constraint (Constraint, Dict (..), type (:-) (..)) type family All :: (k -> Constraint) -> [k] -> Constraint type family All c xs where All _ '[] = () All c (x ': xs) = (c x, All c xs) 
 However, GHC is unable to figure out the following:
 type T :: [Type] -> Type foo :: All Monoid r => T r -> Bool bar :: All Semigroup r => T r -> Bool baz :: All Monoid r => T r -> Bool baz t = foo t && bar t -- This is an error: cannot deduce `All Semigroup r` from `All Monoid r` -- The workaround solution is to change the type of `baz` to baz :: (All Monoid r, All Semigroup r) => T r -> Bool -- but this is pretty annoying and cumbersome -- `All Monoid r` does imply `All Semigroup r`, I just need to prove it to GHC 
 One solution is to write a function with the type below, however I have no clue how to go about it
 -- | Map a constraint implication across a type-level list mapImpl :: (forall a. c1 a :- c2 a) -> All c1 r :- All c2 r mapImpl = Sub Dict -- ERROR 
 Is this possible? Or would some implementation require additional class constraints on r. Any help would be appreciated!

I got a really nice development environment for RJSX and as a matter of fact, I would still be using that as my main editing suite for RJSX and using it professionally but I have to admit. I have spent around 3 months with Doom Emacs now and in that time I also started following along system crafters videos to build my own config but I have to say that unfortunately, I'm a person that switches often between a lot of different languages and platforms and tools. 
 e.g. While I'm working as a freelancer in RJSX I also develop blender plugins and I'm also learning unreal engine 5 and WebGL on the side.
 For someone like me, I was finding that I'd have to spend 3-4 days dedicatedly crafting an environment for every new requirement I have. I do a lot of different minor development-related things and this was really killing my will to work. 
 But, emacs did force me to learn evil mode for editing and I have to say I'd always use that till the day I die now. I cannot imagine how I didn't. I also added a magit plugin and an org mode plugin on vscode and also using the vspacecode plugin for spacemacs like keybindings now. 
 My affair with emacs would definitely continue for a long time, I'm sure. But unfortunately, the barrier of entry is rather high for someone like me who wants to do a lot of things and honestly for the time being I'd have to hop back to VSCode to edit a lot of different things. I am a little disappointed but still hopeful that I'd be back some time.

 I want to create a one line function "argmax" using fold where I enter an anonymous/lambda function and a list. Then I apply the function to the list and get a new list based on the function. Now I get the maximum value of the second list and return the element from the first list which created the maximum value when applied to the function.
 It should look like this:
 Input: argmax (\x -> mod x 5) [1,4,7]
 the second list should be: [1,4,2]
 The Maximum element from the second list is 4 so it should return 4 from the first list, because mod 4 5 is 4.
 So the output should be: 4
 Currently I have this:
 argmax :: (Ord a) => a -> [a] -> a
 argmax f xs = foldr max f xs
 but it doesnt work for a anonymous function
 I get this error: No instance for (Show (Integer -> Integer))
 which I don't really understand.
 I tried to change the type signature, but that did not help.
 thanks in advance! ^

 I was looking at the source a few minutes ago and usage within icomplete.el but couldn't quite crack what is it about. From the name I assumed something like "use icomplete for capf" but that doesn't seem to be the case from looking at icomplete sources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm using the "olivetti" package with a line width of 80 characters (olivetti-body-width 80). The text is centered. This setting works fine for a fixed-pitch font. However, when I'm using a variable-pitch font such as Times New Roman, the 80 characters per line allow up to 100 characters per line to fit. This is due to the nature of variable-pitch fonts where characters are not equal in width like monospaced fonts.
 100 characters per line is too long for optimal reading and increasing the font size doesn't help. The font is already at a large size. 
 What would be the solution? To reduce the olivetti 80 characters per line setting to 70 characters per line which will compensate for the variable pitch font? But that will cause the programming modes that use a fixed-pitch font to have short lines.

 list them in column view
  
taken a couple shots at this as well as searching on things like org-collector but not really finding an easy way to do this (which makes org-mode look way harded than obsidian where I did this with dataview pretty simply)

abstruse abstractions by offering a more intuitive angle from which to

The aim of this post is to present an alternative angle — that of interactive
semantics — from which to view one of the fundamental notion of functional
programming: higher-order functions.
Interactive semantics provide an intuitive understanding of the concept of
higher-order functions, which is a worthy mathematical investigation in itself.
But this approach is also practical, shedding a new light on existing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to create a function where it adds the total char count of a list. For example, an input of testLength ["test", "string"] should return [4, 10] since the test has 4 letters and string has 6, but it gets added to the 4. An input with 3 elements would add all 3 of them together on the 3rd and so on. I currently have:
 testLength :: [String] -> [Int] testLength ss = [length s | s <- ss] 
 Using the previous example, this returns [4, 6] because it does not add in the 4. I know I need addition somewhere but Haskell isn't very nice when it comes to creating variables within functions to hold a value so I am not sure how to keep the 4 in order to add it to the 6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel pretty dumb asking this, let alone how I’ll feel reading the answer, 
 I used paredit. sometimes I’m editing code and the parenthesis have become a bit of a mess. Sometimes I want to delete them. 
 Paraedit won’t let me, so occasionally I need to turn the mode and delete a parenthesis or two then re-enable it. 
 This does not seem like the way. 
 How should it be used and if this is a feature is there another package which might be worth trying?

 function1 :: monadState Int m => String -> m String 
 I know that String would be the input and that m String is supposed to be the output, but how would that be formatted? Also, does the monadState Int m have any interference with the input string? To further the example, if funtion1 were to be a function where it counts words in a string and returns the string with the count, would be as simple as having the format as something like:
 funtion1 s = s ++ m 
 or is there some monad stuff to worry about? Obviously somewhere in function1 would be the actual code to count the words in the string. Thanks!

 My problem is that it seems like the buffer eglot is using to error check my code is out of sync from the buffer I'm editing in. See the attached image for details. I'm not really sure what to do or what may be causing this. This also may be a flymake problem, but I'm not sure on how eglot+flymake play together. Any help would be appreciated.

 If I edit the variable name say to \"dsavedStyles\", then flymake reports \"Use of undeclared identifier 'dsavedStylesalw';\" which is still wrong, but strange

For example, let's say there's a passage like this:

  
It’s important to understand the layers that make up a design, because getting those layers to work together is the key to creating designs that look good, that solve problems, and that ultimately influence your users.


For the Zettel, should I always start it with "According to [so and so]...", or should I just omit that and essentially present the idea as my own? And if I come across another source that slightly expands on this, how should I express that? And how should I deal with a source contradicting this information?]]></summary>

 The package aimes to a niche market and few user is interested to deploy it to their own env . But they raised the concern to me that , ``Haskell`` is non-main stream programming language as they are using Java /CPP etc .
 eventhough I setup a RESTful interface for them but they hesitated.
 should I walk away as they are not the right target user ? ( but it's a niche market, there isn't much user , should I just give up on them ?)
 or should I put effort to `thrift` or `gRPC` that would make it easier to intergrate with ecosystem ? eventhough I suspect this help or not

 better support for Markdown sources (running Markdown from GitHub Gists, URLs, snippets, etc.);
 and a whole set of other tweaks & fixes, details on the release page.
  
For those who do not know it, Scala CLI is a command-line tool to interact with the Scala language. It's great for learning the language, writing scripts, prototyping and such.
 As of SIP-46, it is also in the implementation phase of becoming the new official Scala runner.Feel free to try out the scala-experimental installation.

 When I'm editing a big org-mode file sometimes I mistype an extra bracket somewhere and emacs freezes. This started happening just after I enabled smartparens' pair highlighting using
 (show-smartparens-global-mode +1) in my ~/.doom.d/config.el file,
 so it's pretty clear its because of it scanning the whole buffer looking for the matching bracket to highlight.
 Is there a variable I can set to give a line / chars / milliseconds roof to this?
 Thank you all.
 UPDATE: I just realized it is not about the highlighting itself, but smartparents in general.
 I toggled show-smartparents-global-more, I had no highligting but the freezing happened anyway.

 FOSDEM 2023 will be held on 4 & 5 February 2023, in Brussels. For more information see the official site. The Haskell devroom (specialist track) will take place on Sunday 5 February, from 13:10 to 17:00 UTC+1.
 We need more proposals! We need your help!
 This is an amazing opportunity to promote Haskell, and functional programming generally, to a legion of free software developers and enthusiasts. But right now, we are not even close to filling our schedule. If we don't fill our ~4 hour schedule, the Haskell devroom will not happen.
 Therefore we are extending our Call for Proposals until Saturday 2022-12-10. We are also now welcoming proposals for tutorials/workshops and longer presentations (up to 45 minutes). Shorter presentations are still welcome, of course.
 So if you want to propose an introductory workshop, install fest, hack session, or something similar, have at it.
 You can also help by sharing this CFP far and wide, and with specific people you think might have something interesting to present.
 Thanks,
 Fraser Tweedale

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I enable the three modes in the title, moving up and down with the arrow keys places the cursor in the wrong column when on a line with substituted symbols. The offset seems to be related to the org-indent depth.
 I've searched and searched but have not found a solution other than disabling one of the three modes.
 Here's a minimal repro. Anyone dealt with this in their config or have advice on how to hunt down the problem? I'm not even sure which project to make a bug report in.
 (use-package org :mode (("\\.org$" . org-mode)) :ensure org-plus-contrib :hook ((org-mode . org-indent-mode) (org-mode . visual-line-mode)) ; alternatively, comment the following lines and uncomment org-modern :config (add-to-list 'font-lock-extra-managed-props 'display) (font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode '(("^\\(-\\)\\( \\)" 1 '(face nil display "•")))) ) ; (use-package org-modern ; :ensure t ; :after org ; :hook ((org-mode . (lambda () (org-modern-mode))))) 
 Try on this file. When the cursor is on item 1 (which has a prettified bullet), moving down to item 2, then up again places the cursor 2 to the right of where it was before.

 If I make a change to any of these files they do into effect, but when I try to install a package, the mini-buffer shows the default directory: Directory ‘~/.emacs.d/’ does not exist; create? (y or n).
 How can I ensure that MELPA installs packages in the Emacs directory located inside XDG home ($HOME/.config/emacs) instead of the default user home (~/.emacs.d) ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR, prototyped a library providing an IOE e a type that tracks the exceptions that can occur in an action that interacts with the real world. Relies on the normal runtime exception system, so no performance hit as ExceptT.
 Curious what people think about this. I know there've been many a blog posts on how to improve this, but I have yet to see any writings on this specific approach. IMO this approach gets us a lot more type safety at the expense of a bit more verbosity.
 Currently not on Hackage yet, since it's still in the prototyping phase, but if there's interest, there could certainly be an organized effort to get a full library on Hackage, get it used in production, and even possibly open a GHC proposal to merge into base (more details in README).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Vim user who is trying to migrate to emacs. On Vim, I've been using the following function to execute code:
 ``` function! ExecuteOnTerminal(type) range if (&ft=='bash' || &ft=='sh') if a:type == "V" :vert botright '<,'> %terminal bash else :vert botright %terminal bash endif elseif (&ft=='python') if a:type == "V" :vert botright '<,'> %terminal python3 else :vert botright %terminal python3 endif elseif (&ft=='awk') if a:type == "V" '<,'>w! /tmp/file.awk else :w! /tmp/file.awk endif :vert botright terminal awk -f /tmp/file.awk /home/user/sampleFile endif endfunction
 vnoremap <silent> <F10> :call ExecuteOnTerminal("V")<CR> nnoremap <silent> <F10> :call ExecuteOnTerminal("I")<CR> ```
 Basically, it detects if I'm selecting lines or not. If I press F10, it'll execute the selected lines or the entire file depending on the type of the file. I'd like to create a similar function on emacs. I know that for that I'd need:
  
A function that detects the language of the file like &ft does on vimscript.
 A way of detecting if I'm selecting lines or not on the current file and getting the content of it.
 Something like the terminal command from vim, it executes the code on a split window.
  
I'd like to create my own personalized function because I end up having more control of what's happening, like the last elseif that I'm executing awk code with the data of a hardcoded file. This way I can handle multiple types of files with a single shortcut... But I'm having trouble finding equivalent elisp functions for the three points that I've listed here. Can anyone help me on that? Or give me some advice for executing code on emacs (not org files, just plain scripts .py, .sh, .bash, .js and so on)?

 And thought, while doing that, I might as well, try different package manager.
 Can't decide whether to use straight.el, or elpaca.. they both seem nice #_#

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone ! 
 I recently had to update my system and since then I've noticed something odd with pyright. When I open a project and my lsp server starts with pyright, the file I first opened to open the project doesn't work well. I don't get the usual autocompletion, the errors listed by flycheck all appear in the first in the first lines and don't get removed if i correct the acutal error, ....
 And this only happens in the very first file which started the server ! On top of that I've also noticed that it only happens when I have more than one listed lsp workspace folder using pyright.
 My current workaround is to kill the buffer and reopen the file again but it would beetter if I could get rid of it entirely.
 I use doom emacs with pyright and lsp and I also use pyenv for my virtualenvs with the pyenv package which allows emacs to automatically detect the local version I set for a project and use it. 
 It's very weird and I have a hard time finding the root of the problem so if someone had a similar issue at some point or as any clue on what to do it would be very much appreciated !

 ~"foo"~ bar ~baz~ 
 Then the entire line will be rendered as inline code, whereas I'd expect just "foo" and baz to be rendered that way.
 Weirdly, this only happens with code, not with any other type of emphasis marker.
 My Google-fu doesn't seem to be working here; I found this Stack Overflow post, it's completely unrelated AFAICT (for one thing, if org-emphasis-alist were the problem, then all types of emphasis markers should be affected).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an exercise in learning Lisp, I am trying to write a pattern
 matching routine that I can call
 like (match pattern form) where both pattern and form are just
 forms. My ultimate goal is to perform tree-manipulations via structural editing and macroexpansion of lisp forms, where after the manipulation, I am left with a lisp form that evaluates to something useful. Because working with code is a macro's domain, I thought using them would be the most natural way forward. However,
 due to the recursive nature of the problem, I need to call match
 from within itself to see if a sub-pattern successfully matched
 a sub-form. This leads to write things like (eval \(match`
 ,sub-pattern ,sub-form)) inside the macro. This feels like an
 ugly hack, but the alternative would be to use functions and
 quote
 every input, leading to (match \(quote ,sub-pattern) `(quote`
 ,sub-form)) . Both of these make me feel like I am doing
 something wrong, surely there is a clean, lispy way of doing
 this. Is there an idiomatic way to write the routine? Should
 this be a task for functions or macros?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all -- I'm attempting to write a basic, type-directed program synthesis application using the ghc library. One issue I have run into is in comparing the types of arguments in polymorphic functions. 
 I would like to be able to take a function of type, say, `Identity a -> b` and compare the first argument for equality with a known type `Identity a`. I would like to use the `eqType` function in GHC.Core.Type, but I don't know how to correctly separate the function type to do so.
 There are helper functions like `splitFunTy_maybe`, but that cannot be directly applied to my function type since it is wrapped in a `Forall` type constructor. My (very hacky) solution right now involves stripping the `Forall` constructor, splitting the bare function, then comparing the two types on their type constructors (in this case, `Identity`).
 I'm wondering if there's a better way to go about this, because I'm having trouble extending my current solution to broader applications. Any help from ghc wizards would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to finally learn a bit more Haskell than my current smattering. In fact, I'm going to try the Advent of Code in it, as a forcing function.
 I'm trying to get a better handle on performance. For example, I really don't understand why the foldl' implementation in Data.List,
  foldl' :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b {-# INLINE foldl' #-} foldl' f z0 = \ xs -> foldr (\ (x::a) (k::b->b) -> oneShot (\ (z::b) -> z `seq` k (f z x))) (id::b->b) xs z0 
 works so much better in GHCi than my naive implementation,
  foldl' f !z [] = z foldl' f !z (x:xs) = foldl' f (f z x) xs 
 Sure, that one is better than just using foldl or foldr, but it still takes about 2 s in GHCi or runghc to sum 1 to 10M. Compiled, it takes 0.2 s (reasonable), but plain-vanilla Python or Scheme (guile) only take about 0.5 s.
 The Data.List implementation takes about 0.5 s, much more in line with what I expect a reasonable interpreter to do, but I don't understand how it does it.
 Can someone walk me through it? I'd like to figure out how to make things run quickly in GHCi for while I'm going through Advent of Code problems. More generally, how should I think about performance?
 (And yes, I've read the comment in the code, but I didn't understand it.)
 Edit: In particular, if someone could help walk me through the comment in https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/src/GHC.List.html#foldl%27, I'd appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was working on a large project and using lots of make, make clean, configure and other commands that triggered large streams of output in my shell. It was getting hard to keep track of which output came from which input.
 So I came up with this solution: it makes a 'sticky' header that always shows the prompt corresponding to the top-visible output-line (hard to explain but see screenshots for reference)
 (defun comint-get-prompt-above () "Get the prompt above the top visible line in the current window." (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (window-start)) (comint-previous-prompt 1) (let ((prompt (thing-at-point 'line))) (aset prompt (- (length prompt) 1) 0) ; remove the newline ending char prompt))) (define-minor-mode comint-sticky-mode "Minor mode to show the previous prompt as a sticky header." :group 'comint :global nil :lighter nil (if comint-sticky-mode (setq-local header-line-format (list '(:eval (comint-get-prompt-above)))) (setq-local header-line-format nil))) 
 Sharing here because:
  
I'd like some feedback on my solution.
 Code-wise I'm wondering if there is a more efficient solution, maybe without calling comint-next-prompt
 I figured other people might find this feature useful: feel free to paste it in your config and let me know your experience.
 If people are interested, I'm wondering if I should create a package for this.
 On the one hand I'd like the feature to be available to whoever wants it. But also it's such a small piece of code that maybe just sharing it as a snippet is enough. Unless there are possible enhancements, or additional related features that might go well with this?

 Looks like this whole journey started in May when Daniel suggested Vertico replace Selectrum. selectrum#598 The amount of humility and civility displayed by both Radon and Daniel has been inspiring—not something you see often in the software world.
 My journey has been Helm → Ivy → Selectrum → Vertico, and I can confidently say that Vertico has been the fastest, most reliable, and least buggy of them all. Thank you to all you Emacs package maintainers, but especially Radon and Daniel for working so hard to make lightweight completion the best it could be!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I want to automate the creation of a new denote journal file each day. I want to verify if it already exists, if not create it and then find the previous journal, check if there are TODO/SCHEDULED/DEADLINE tasks and move them into the new journal.
 For now I have the following:
 (require 'cl-lib) ;; needed for cl-return (defun journal-day-exists-p ( target ) "check if journal for a day already exists" (file-expand-wildcards (concat (denote-directory) target "*_journal*.org"))) (defun find-previous-journal () "Find most recent journal" (let* ((today (format-time-string "%Y%m%d")) (all_journals (sort (directory-files "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/denotes" nil "^[0-9].*_journal.*org$") #'string>))) (dolist (journal all_journals) (when (string< (substring journal 0 8) today) (cl-return journal))))) (defun my-denote-journal () "Create an entry tagged 'journal' with the date as its title." (interactive) (let* ((today (format-time-string "%Y%m%d")) (filename (car (journal-day-exists-p today))) (prev (find-previous-journal))) (if filename (find-file filename) (progn (denote (format-time-string "%A %e %B %Y") ; format like Tuesday 14 June 2022 '("journal") nil "~/Denotes") (insert "* Thoughts\n\n* Ideas\n\n* Code\n\n* TASKS\n\n"))))) 
 Now the part where I need help is in moving the Tasks, I already have the idea that I should use org-refile or org-archive, but I am not seeing how to open the previous file and get what I need from it.
 Can anyone help?
 ​
 Thank you!

 Do you know if the Haskell Brain course (link) is any good? I do not have experience in AI/ML and I'd like to give it a go some time, but I'm not sure how far this particular course would take me in terms of enabling me to develop any real projects, etc. The Tensorflow bindings seem to not be maintained as of today (last commit to master will make 2 years next Feb.)
 Thanks!

 Tramp, while sometimes usable, has poor performance and I've found it to hang during many different operations. It's not easy to debug when things go wrong, and it seems as though it's just a product of old, single threaded code that does not compete with better ideas on remote code editing - a la VSCode's remote server.
 Will we ever see Emacs embrace an over the network client/server split and make remote code editing a first class feature like VSCode?

 1. Multistage validation
 I would like to break down the validation into several stages. Errors from each stage should be accumulated into the "final list of errors", and a validation stage should only run on data that was successfully validated by the previous stage. In other words: each stage should return a list of validation errors along with the data that passed the validations of that stage. In addition most stages require IO to pull some data needed for the actual validation. An example using 2 stages:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wanted to share another note, but the book didn't have usable endnotes, so I found myself writing about a prerequisite to making good endnotes instead.
I found the direct access/sequential access distinction interesting when I thought of how RAM works; but maybe I've stretched it too thin? In a blog post I'd remove the last subsection, but for my private cesspool I'm inclined to keep it 
202211261601 Endnotes require direct access via chapter marks
  #endnote #usability
To make book endnotes as usable as footnotes, each page or page spread needs to show all relevant information the reader requires to find the appropriate endnote.
Paperback endnotes are usually not optimized for "direct access" (aka "random access" as in computer RAM[[202211281004]]): Endnotes are often counted from 1 on a chapter-by-chapter basis. Then the endnotes of a book will be sectioned by chapter.
Usability problem
Non-fiction paperback books usually only print the author and book title at the top of pages, so you don't have an easy way to know which chapter you're in.
Example usage of bad endnotes
If you're on page X and want to know what endnote Y is about, you need to page back until you find the beginning of the chapter, or look up the chapter's page range in the table of contents first. Then you can navigate to the approriate section in the endnotes.
Random access vs bad sequential access
"Random/direct access" would be possible if one of the page headers contained the current chapter title to make finding the appropriate section in the endnotes easier. Then you'd have all the information, the complete address, to de-reference the number Y.
If you page through the book, and simultaneously advance the endnote sections and leave a bookmark there, you would get "sequential access" that relies on a process like this.]]></summary>

 On macOS, you can do C-h in any text field to do backspace, which is nice and ergonomic to me, so I've got in the habit of using this key combination instead of the backspace key.
 In Emacs, I know C-h is bound to help. But in INSERT MODE, I would like to have C-h behave as backspace instead.
 I have tried putting the following into my user-config, but it seems to basically turn C-h into a NOP instead. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong here?

 When pulling in citations from sites like Google scholar there’s no option for biblatex, and I can’t just mix styles together.
 Certain fields (like date vs year/month) need to be combined and transformed, and some TeX syntax is removed, so it’s slightly nontrivial. I can make a call to Biber as an external process to do the conversion but it’s slow (around 2 seconds).
 I’m avoiding using Zotero or Jabref etc as I’m nearly finished implementing a system that totally replaces them.
 Thanks!

 In a function, I use the following to jump to a specific heading (below, the heading would be named "Example" in the above file):
 (re-search-forward (concat "^\\* " "Example" "$") nil t) 
 And from there I can insert a property with org-set-property for that heading.
 Everything works very well for my needs, but I kind of feel like there is probably a built-in function that does what my re-search-forward line does but in a more elegant way. However, I can't find such a built-in function. Is there one?

 Sometimes I fallback to C-x 8 RET.
 I use ipa-x-sampa for IPA and seems it is a /wˈaɪdspɹəd stˈændɚd/...

 I wander if rfc1345 is popular, arrows are simple: &-> or &<=. or other math stuff: &(C ⊂, &(I 〖, &(U ∩, &(_ ⊆, &+- ±, &!= ≠, &14 ¼, &FA ∀, &TE ∃.

The rest of this post has whatever details I think I might get asked about, but probably excludes some necessary details which, due to my ignorance, I don't realize are necessary! :)
 I do now have native compilation in both installations, and for built-in functions describe-function says "... is a native-compiled Lisp functions in ...".

Because while in theory the concept sounds awesome, I don't get the way it was implemented. And I was already close to filing a bug report for this issue that then turned out to be "intended behavior".
  
The other day I ran into the situation that I had two type aliases that both mapped to Lists of something. Then I wanted to implement an extension method on both of these types with the same signature.  type A = List[Int] type B = List[String] extension (a: A) { def doSomething: Unit = ??? } extension (b: B) { def doSomething: Unit = ??? }  But the compiler refused to do that because of the methods being identical after type erasure. Okay, I get that.
 But before I proceed with the core story here,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello wizards, I've got a weird one today.
 I'm trying to write a small package which re-defines eshell/cat. I'm doing this with
 (defun eshell/cat (&rest args) "doc string" (do-various-things-to args)) 
 Before loading this file, which cat returns "eshell/cat is a byte-compiled Lisp function in 'em-unix.el'." 
 But after loading the file, which cat returns "/usr/bin/cat".
 Now I can manually invoke my new function with eshell/cat, but it should be callable as just cat. Everything I've seen online indicates that defining eshell/<cmd> exposes <cmd> as an eshell command, as does the built-in Info manual. 
 This issue occurs whenever I start eshell and then load the file. When I load the file first, eshell's init sequence clobbers it and restores the definition from em-unix.el.
 What is the correct way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read a lot of resources about Zettelkasten, and there are many things I'd like to address, but this post is about prefix ID for notes. Ok, I don't understand why you would use the popular timestamp thing. Sure, you know when the note was created, and you fixed the issue with duplicate titles (which, really, who experiences?) Other than that, what? Then you have this unclean 12-digit number in front of your note title; amazing.
I've been trying to use Luhmann's 1,2,3b,3c etc., system, which works fine, but there is no convenient way to use it (I am using Obsidian). I used this 12-digit timestamp on hundreds of notes, and it's simply useless. I need something else!
Yes, I researched other solutions, but they were not convincing and too geeky, as I recall. I wonder if someone had the same experience as me. The 12-digit timestamp prefix is missing the point of the Zettelkasten, IMO. I'm looking for alternatives and am eager to listen to others' experiences with ID prefixes methods for Zettelkasten. Thanks!]]></summary>

 It's able to highlight a mispelled word, but when I go to correct it, it doesn't offer possible matches - this means I have to correct it myself, even having to google the correct spelling. Obviously not ideal.
 Any ideas why it isn't suggesting anything?

 Is there a general way to jump to the end of a surrounding-pair in evil-surround? % doesn't seem to do the trick, it only looks at parentheses and such, not custom pairs defined by evil-surround.

Though he indicates it was a "process [he] developed", it is broadly similar to that of the influential "historical method" laid out by Ernst Bernheim and later Seignobos/Langlois in the late 1800s.

 This seems very un-haskelly to me. Why is this the case, that errors are not handled with `Either`? Also, how can I handle these errors? I thought there is no such thing as a `try...catch` in haskell, but maybe I'm mistaken?

 I'm using Emacs 28.1, org-mode 9.5.5, pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.22, ImageMagick 6.9.12 running on Fedora 37.
 org-latex-packages-alistis set to '(("version=4" "mhchem" t))
 I have tried setting org-preview-latex-default-process to dvipng, dvisvgmor, or imagemagick.
 When the org file is exported to latex and PDF, the mhchem syntax is correctly interpreted and exported. And when calling org-latex-preview on \(2 + 3\) a preview is correctly generated. However, when calling org-latex-preview on \ce{Na2CO4} nothing happens.

 The discussion is here: https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el/issues/285
 In short, the following works, but the fallback value of 12:00 a.m. feels like a hack:
 (require 'org) (require 'mastodon) (defun ct/mastodon-toot--schedule () (interactive) (let* ((time-value (org-read-date nil t nil "Schedule post at:" (date-to-time "2022-11-26 00:00 am"))) (iso8601-string (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z" time-value))) (setq-local mastodon-toot--scheduled-at iso8601-string) (message (format "Scheduled post for '%s'." iso8601-string)))) (define-key mastodon-toot-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-s") #'ct/mastodon-toot--schedule) 
 org-read-date works flawlessly otherwise.
 How'd you approach this?
 Feedback and discussion (and PRs on codeberg.org :)) welcome!

Specifically, if you scroll down to the comment made by 147pm, they say an obvious omission, i.e., that you don't get set union commutativity when you use lists as sets -- despite clever attempts to get rid of "duplicates." But then a comment below says very deep things about quotient type and commutative modulo permutations. I was wondering if someone could unpack that a bit. What's he saying about, against the 147pm comment? Can someone direct me to resources/texts that might get into this? Once again, Haskell amazes. What other language has this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the font installed on my PC, and it works well with other terminals such as Alacritty, but when I open my shell via the shell-mode the prompt is not displayed correctly.
 This is the view of the prompt in shell-mode, it can't display the icons.
 Edit:
 After searching Emacs documentation, I came across chapter 14.19 How Text Is Displayed, and was able to kind of pinpoint what the issue is:
  
On text terminals, characters that cannot be displayed using the terminal encoding are normally displayed as question signs. 
  
And from chapter 22.12 Coding Systems for Terminal I/O:
  
The command C-x RET t (set-terminal-coding-system) specifies the coding system for terminal output. If you specify a character code for terminal output, all characters output to the terminal are translated into that coding system.
  
I have changed the value of this command and changed the encoding to UTF-8 but still got no result.
 This is all that I have concluded, I am still an Emacs newbie, but I am trying to learn.

Seemed like a really polished system with chance to be performant as well (strict, proper records, dependent types, mutability in do, defined contiguous array with O(1) access and Uniqueness analysis allowing for optimized mutating in place a la Swift).

 Wanted to know what people of this sub think of this language.
 Also, is it ready for prime time, where I can build non-trivial program even if for personal hobby projects.

 I'm wondering, is there a way to map a key to the leader map (not the local leader map), only in a specific mode?
 Basically, I want to customize what "SPC c c" does per mode, since usually I want to run an elisp command, not a command line program. So in LaTeX, I want "SPC c c" to do #'TeX-command-run-all, but not in other modes.
 Is there a way to do this? I tried the following but it didn't seem to work

 This warning seems to be at the heart of the problem
  
Warning (straight): Two different recipes given for "org" (:repo cannot be both "https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs/org-mode.git" and "bzg/org-mode")
  
Is there some way to redefine the recipe for a package? It seems configuring it to choose one of melpa gnu-elpa, git or some other source must be the way to go.

One of my purposes in starting a ZK was to capture brief memories or "snapshots" of my past, with a focus partly on what happened and partly on how I felt (at the time) or feel (now) about that event.  I don't pursue this in any organized way, either in relation to time or theme.  I simply deal with memories as they arise, prompted by a discussion with a friend or family member, or from looking at a photo.  The order is thus random. But I hoped that as I gathered a large number of brief memories and connected them together, they would form a somewhat coherent personal history that was also intimately tied to other zettels, such as those expressing personal values and beliefs.
This is now coming to fruition, although there is still…]]></summary>

 If I understand correctly, ibuffer will apply my-agenda-group to every buffer, and will display that buffer under "Agenda" if the function returns non-nil for the buffer. I have called that function inside various buffers myself to check manually that it works correctly. However, this same function does not work within ibuffer-saved-filter-groups and I am unable to figure out why.

 I can enable it without error messagges but the whitespaces are still there. That behavior was different in the past.
 The rep on GitHub seems to be dead. Last commit was 2020.
 Are you aware of a good and easy alternative?

 It is similar to the :after keyword in use-package.
 On a side note that README is too much on a single page.
 The topics need to be broken out into separate pages. In particular the comparison with the other packages doesn't belong in it.

 As result, I start searching I stumble on: 1. textobjec config from doom emacs. 2. Traget.el 3. evil-textobj-tree-sitter.el 4. Objed.el 
 However, it is confusing with all these packages and for newbie the difference is hard to understand. All I want is to select text, line, sentence, paragraph, block, text between tags, functions etc.
 My initial thought is that the 3rd options seems interesting but I think it doesn't support org syntax and I can't select lines, paragraphs with it.
 P.s: I use evil 🙈

        <updated>2022-11-25T03:27:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're wondering why, well, just to reduce my dependency cone and possibly build times. No deeper reasons.
 Replaced sbt-assembly with sbt-native-packager's dist command to build a zip file. Unzipped that. Then added the resulting directory into my Docker image. The image now has everything needed to run the app, no fat JAR required.
 Replacing sbt-buildinfo was slightly trickier. I decided to roll the replacement by hand and 'sacrifice' a couple of things that sbt-buildinfo provides. Let's cover all of them:
  
name: I can just hard-code the project name, it's not like it's going to change all the time
 version: just need to plug in the output of git describe here
 scalaVersion: do I really need this info in my health page? Not really. I can just look up the version, pull up my repo, and figure out the Scala version there
 sbtVersion: same argument, I don't really need this in my app's health page
 buildTime: just need to plug in the output of date -u -Iseconds here (e.g. 2022-11-25T03:11:49+00:00)
 startTime: bonus, sbt-buildinfo doesn't provide this but it's trivial to add, just run val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString eagerly when the app starts up.
  
OK, so above in a couple of places I mention plugging in the output of shell commands, how to do that? Pretty simple. In the project code we just have a file like this committed in the repo:
 // Info.scala package build object Info { val name = "my-app-name" val version = "TBD" val buildTime = "TBD" val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString } 
 And at build time we just replace this file with a generated one:
 # build.sh printf ' package build object Info { val name = "my-app-name" val version = "%s" val buildTime = "%s" val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString } ' "$(git describe)" "$(date -u -Iseconds)" sbt test dist unzip target/.../my-app-name.zip 
 Yes, that's printf in Unix shell. It's kinda hacky–but it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I typeset math a lot in latex and im getting tired of distributing/leibniz'ing terms around. I wrote a pretty crappy package for sending some stuff to mathematica and inserting them into the document but this is not enough. Ideally, i would use mathematica as the last processing step, and use something more interactive to expand/distribute/factor terms. 
 ​
 My idea is to use Wisent to write a simple latex parser that can output the AST in lisp form, then modify it with structural editing in place, and finally have the lisp execute to print out automatically formatted latex code + any processing I may want to do with mathematica/sympy. Ofc, a big part of this plan depends on being able to modify the lisp code easily. Probably one of the most common cases would be transforming
 (product a (sum b1 b2 ... bn)) -> (sum (product a b1) ... (product a bn)) 
 so I need a really featureful structural editing package that allows me to jump between and into terms, combine, swap, what have you. Do any hardcore lispers have a really powerful setup they would like to share?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a way to pin packages to specific commits in straight.el and I came across this answer here on reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/iyzs29/is_there_a_way_to_pin_a_package_to_a_specific/g6frovq/ with this example.
 (use-package diminish :demand :straight (diminish :host github :repo "myrjola/diminish.el" :tag "v0.45")) 
 but according to the answer this:
  
But I think this only applies to the initial checkout, and the real way is to run straight-freeze-versions, which creates a lockfile. Then straight-thaw-versions applies whatever versions are in there to the package repos.
  
I think I also saw a :ref option in an answer here on reddit but I can't find the either the :ref and :tag option in the straight README. There is a :branch option though and that is the one I want to stick to, but it may not be safe if changes or some fixes which I may not want are backported to it.
 My idea then is to clone the repo I want, create a branch from the commit hash I want and point straight to it. If I don't make any changes to it than that "branch" will be good with straight forever, and I should be able to use the :fork option if I want to retain a reference to the original configuration.
 Is this cloning and creating an unchanging branch a good idea? I have read about the lockfiles but at this stage it is all a bit much for me. I want something I can wrap my head around for now and get to the advanced stuff later.
 For instance I want to stick to org 9.3.8 in one of my profiles. Can I set the :branch to release_9.3.8?

 Today, I bring you Package-wide Search, a way of scanning packages for certain types of objects and return all of them type-safely in a nice list to be used as you see fit.
 This one I believe is more difficult to grasp especially because of the many quoted types and the cache invalidation I mention at the end, I hope this does not discourage anyone from trying to write their own macros, I will continue posting more examples (hopefully simpler than this one)

Instead it errors out and tells me that c is not a valid prefix.
 If I force load the package by manually pressing "C-c x" then control mode finds the binding and it works until i close emacs.
 Is it possible to make it so that control mode understands the binding without first pressing "C-c x" ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of transferring my whole messy config over to use-package, and I have a few questions:
  
I can't seem to find one place that lists all installed packages. I can see some installed packages with M-x list-packages (they will be tagged as "installed", "built-in", etc), but it does not seem to list all packages. For instance, ibuffer is not listed there, but it is a package, and it is installed (I can see ibuffer.el.gz and ibuffer.elc in /usr/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/). Is there a way to see a complete list of packages? Something like the installed packages listed by M-x list-packages plus the installed packages found in /usr/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/, but in the same place?
 
I presume that all packages found in /usr/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/ are somewhat "built-in" (i.e., part of the core Emacs packages). If so, why aren't they listed with M-x list-packages as "built-in"?
 
What is the distinction between a package found in /usr/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/ and a package tagged as "built-in" by M-x list-packages? What does the latter's use of "built-in" mean, really?
 
 Thanks.

 I'm trying to make an operator in evil that does the following: 
  
takes a motion for object to keep 
 takes another motion to delete 
  
so for example if i have a string with | as the cursor "testing |with a string" and i use the operator in it with iw then i" this would leave the string as "with" .
 the problem here is that I have some motion keys that are not standard evil motion keys those functions when used with this operator they produce this error evil-extract-count: Key sequence contains no complete binding.
 an example of the motion functions is: 
 (evil-define-motion my-backward-sexp-or-pyblock ( count args) :jump nil :type 'word (if (eq major-mode 'python-mode) (if (python-info-end-of-block-p) (python-nav-backward-sexp count t t) (python-nav-backward-sexp count t) ) (sp-backward-sexp count) ) ) 
 any ideas on how to solve this problem?

 On Linux and FreeBSD this works OK, but on MacOS this is terrible, the MacOS terminal emulator creates a lot of havoc.
 Setting up a emacsclient / emacs-server combi over tcp seems rather complicated, so I haven't tried that. The remote system is a headless system, without X.
 Would installing a different terminal emulator (f.e., with brew) help? If so, any recommendations on what terminal emulator to choose?
 UPDATE: Thanks to the reply's from https://www.reddit.com/user/rpluim/ and https://www.reddit.com/user/Greenskid/, I installed iterm2. 
 In the configuration of the profile, set the left alt-key to "Esc+". After this, using Emacs over ssh works great :)

 Hey all. The code below makes it possible to define custom wrappers for results of org-babel code blocks, as well as custom actions to take after printing the results, such as automatically previewing LaTeX equations. If you think this is worth attempting to submit to the development mailing list let me know!
 ## How it works
 By default it is not possible to add custom wrappers for org-babel results, as they are hardcoded inside *org-babel-insert-result*. The code below extracts the list with result wrappers used inside *org-babel-insert-result* and puts it in a variable called *custom/org-babel-result-wrap-formats*. It is then possible to add new entries to this list, such as this one here,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On most systems, you can implement concurrency using either threads or processes,
where the main difference between the two is that threads share memory and
processes don’t. Modern web browsers support concurrency through the Web
Workers API. Although Web Workers are by default closer to a
multi-process model, when used with WebAssembly you can opt-in to a more
thread-like experience. Just like in systems programming, the choice of
threads vs. processes comes with various trade-offs and performance
implications; I’ll be covering some of them in this post. These examples will be in
Rust, but similar trade-offs should apply to other languages compiled to WASM.

 Occasionally a type class can calculate a constraint through the term level (this is a simplified example to demonstrate the mechanism, it doesn't actually calculate the dictionary from anything):
 class F a where gen :: a -> Dict (Eq a) zed :: a 
 This means that F a entails Eq a but only by running a term-level proof. There is no way to teach ghc this relationship without plugins.
 wit :: forall a. F a :- Eq a wit = Sub (gen @a zed) 
 The normal way to tell ghc that there is an entailment relationship is by making it a superclass
 class Eq a => F a where gen :: a -> Dict (Eq a) zed :: a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a thing that I feel like I should be able to do with lenses, but I can't quite work out how. Here's the idea. I have a MultiTree data structure, which looks like this:
 ```haskell
 data Node a = Node a a deriving stock (Functor, Show, Foldable, Traversable, Generic) type MultiTree b = FreeT Node [] (b)
 -- from the free package: -- newtype FreeT f m a = FreeT { runFreeT :: m (FreeF f a (FreeT f m a)) } -- data FreeF f a b = Pure a | Free (f b) ```
 Basically a multitree is a list of trees of lists of trees of... As an example:
 ```haskell
 trees :: MultiTree Text trees = FreeT [ Free (Node (FreeT [ Pure "John", Pure "Mary", Pure "Andy"]) (FreeT [ Pure "runs", Free (Node (FreeT [Pure "eats"]) (FreeT [Pure "lettuce", Pure "garlic"])) ]) ) ] ```
 Now what I'd like to do is to use the lens library to do a breadth first traversal trees ^.. cleverTraversal which gives ["John eats lettuce", "Mary eats lettuce", "John eats garlic", "Mary eats garlic", "Andy eats lettuce", "Andy eats garlic"].
 The reason I got inspired to do this with lenses is that I came across the plate and levels functions in lens, and those seemed like the right tools to, respectively, traverse recursively, and breadth first traverse. And FreeT has a Plated instance, so I was hoping it would all work magically. But so far I'm a bit stuck.
 Anyway, I thought it might be fun to share...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I am trying to switch from quarto to orgmode to write my masters thesis. 
 One nice feature of quarto is the ability to create a multipage html site (e.g. https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) and pdf from the same source files. Is there a orgmode package out there, that provides something similar out of the box?
 Currently I am kind of overwhelmed with the amount of features of orgmode and dont know where to start ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I'm opening Emacs, I normally want it to display my dashboard. But if I'm opening a file, I just want it to jump straight to the file and not waste time showing the dashboard.
 It seems that there is a pretty trivial solution in cases when Emacs is invoked from the command line: just check if there are command-line arguments that look like files, and make Emacs behave accordingly.
 However, I want Emacs to behave this way even when I invoke it from the GUI: when I double-click on a file, or select 'Open with Emacs'.
 I've done some snooping around the startup code, and it looks like in the latter case, the file that we're about to open does not show up as a command-line argument, so the above solution doesn't work. Yet there must be a way for Emacs to know that it needs to open a file (otherwise it'd just open normally and not immediately display the file in a buffer). So what can I check to know if Emacs was called in this way?

 foreign import data SomeObject :: Type foreign import getName :: SomeObject -> Effect String dostuff obj = do name <- getName obj log name 
 The external object is an opaque type and we are forced to use a function to interact with it.
 Is there a strong reason against using the following approach?
 foreign import data SomeObject :: { name :: String } dostuff obj = do log obj.name

 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version in a couple of weeks.
 Changes since v2.9.1:
 Behavior changes:
  
In YAML configuration files, the package-index key is introduced which takes precedence over the existing package-indices key. The latter is deprecated.
 In YAML configuration files, the hackage-security key of the package-index key or the package-indices item can be omitted, and the Hackage Security configuration for the item will default to that for the official Hackage server. See #5870.

For me, Twitter is no longer the place where I can meet like-minded people and speak about my passions. It has nothing to do with Elon Musk's takeover, actually, as I've been feeling like this for some time, drastically limiting its use. For me, Twitter is like that family dinner where the conversation is monopolized by your uncle's political views, and you're compelled to listen, just because he has a strong voice, he's family and can't tell him to shut up.
 You can choose to stay on Twitter, who knows, I might return in the future, too 🤷‍♂️ but right now it's no longer a healthy environment for a programming community. It's due to all the noise, as outrage generates attention, and outrage is encouraged by Twitter's features. Even when speaking of programming, I don't want inflammatory tweets in my feed, from some ignorant fool, advising Elon to rewrite the whole thing in Go, alongside all the reactions to it. And I'm sure that many Twitter users can agree that engagement has gone off a cliff lately for anything that's not related to politics.
 Some of us are trying out Mastodon. As a full disclosure, out of my Twitter followers, I could find about 4% of them on Mastodon, so around 200 people, some of them inactive. But for me that's enough, plus I found interesting people from other adjacent communities.
 Mastodon may prove to be counterproductive, too, as it's another social network, and maybe there's something wrong with social networks in general. But I like that it has that original web 1.0 vibe to it, and that it is “federated”, like email. Maybe you'd like to try it out, too.
  
I added some notes on how to migrate from Twitter, maybe you'll find it useful:
 alexn.org/wiki/mastodon/
 This is not a call to arms 🙂 it's just a suggestion, as I'd love to see more of you there.
 Cheers 🤗

 (defun foo1 () (save-excursion (let ((baz '(blank blank blank))) (while (and (member 'blank baz) (not (bobp))) (cl-loop for item in-ref baz with pt = (point) when (eq item 'blank) do (unless (member pt baz) (setf item pt))) (when (member 'blank baz) (previous-line))) baz)))

 My understanding is that I can more than likely create one and integrate it if I spend a few weeks learning the syntax of ELisp(?)
 Don't want to come off like I believe I know exactly what I'm talking about (which I don't), while also trying to avoid having this be a "Is it possible to..." post (because I'm sure that it probably is).
 (Currently studying Python as an introduction to programming, and reading up on Haskell as I continue to configure my XMonad. The plan is to begin Teaching Myself Computer Science (https://teachyourselfcs.com/), and of course, Emacs will be a huge part in the undertaking of such a curriculum. Just need to know if I should bite the bullet and overload my brain with learning ELisp so early on in my career, versus waiting until I have a better grasp of things and am able to learn it much more efficiently).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've long looked for macro guides that cover aspects beyond simple debug print statements and after learning macros from documentations + trial and error, I decided to start one of my own.
 First one: Annotation Maps, check it out.
 I hope it helps some people in the situation I was in where nothing seemed to link together. To be noted is that those won't cover the most basic concepts such as the inline keyword, expressions, transparent etc. since these can be understood from the documentation and many other posts.
 I will try to add more guides on use cases I found perfect for macros to showcase the potential of Scala's compile-time system. Feedback appreciated also :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 I'm working on a Scala app and I want to assess my options for hosting, ideally for free while I'm l scale is still incredibly small (well, just me for now 😂). 
 I'm no stranger to managing infrastructure (that's my day job) but hosting a Scala/JDK app is not something I've done before, and since this is a hobby project, I'd like to use a low friction PAAS offering if possible, just to minimise maintenance.
 My preferred cloud is GCP and I'm happy to containerise the workload. I've already considered sticking it in something like cloud run or a plain old VM using free tier, but I'm hoping there might be some lower maintenance and more magical - ideally a java flavoured Vercel or thereabouts? 😉 
 The app currently hosts a Graphql api and also performs polling of an event stream (event sourcing), so I don't think a 'cold start' option would be viable unless I rework the polling and perform the work in-line trigger based 🤔 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure whether to ask this in the clojure sub-reddit or here so trying here first:
 I use LSP Mode with the clojure lsp server. No problems generally. However, I suddenly have one project that refuses to work with lsp.
 What I've looked at/tried:
  
other projects with similar deps.edn work just fine
 lsp describe session looks identical for the working projects and the one that doesn't 
 nothing looks untoward in the lsp-io-log, though I don't know the protocol well I could be missing something, no errors though
 I've blown away my projectile and lsp caches to start from scratch, same issue
 if I manually add my src dir and restart the lsp workspace lsp starts working (of course only down the src dir)
 clojure -Spath shows "src" as an element in the classpath both before and after I manually add the src path\
 lsp claims to initialize successfully and lsp-describe-sessions shows a visited clj file as a buffer under the root of the project
 after manually adding the src dir and restarting the workspace I wind up with two versions of that project in lsp-describe-sessions: one with "/src" and one without. The visited buffer now exists under the new root but not the original
  
I'd prefer not to spend the day digging into lsp-mode/the lsp server, so if anyone has any insights I'd appreciate it.

I'm not sure how this happened, as I don't have a .git directory in home or anything. I wouldn't mind so much, but if I accidentally select that directory as a project emacs hangs so badly that I have to reboot the machine. For some reason I can never find the process ID for emacs for osx to kill -9 it so I have to do a forced reboot with the power button.
 Anyone know a workaround for this? I could just be careful not to select ~ as a project but I'd rather nip this in the bud. It seems that projectile-globally-ignored-directories would ignore ~/code, which isn't great for me, and I'd rather not re-organize my directory structure over this.

Some variables are set without using setq (example: (tool-bar-mode -1)).
 
Some variables are set to nil by setting them to nil (see point 1) while some variables are set to nil by setting them to -1 (see point 2).
 
 According to the docs, nil is false, and everything else is true. So my questions are:
  
Why does (tool-bar-mode -1) set the variable to nil?
 
Why are some variables set using setq and some without?
 
What is the difference between (setq some-variable -1), (some-variable -1), (setq some-variable nil), and (some-variable nil)? Are these equivalent? If yes, what would be the best practice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm happy to announce the new version of dr-cabal — a Haskell dependencies build time profiler!
 This version highlights a few important features:
  
Interactive profiling output
 Computation of a critical path (so you can see non-parallelisable dependencies easier)
 A new refined and simpler CLI interface
  
dr-cabal demo
 The majority of these features were contributed by Andrew Lelechenko (/u/Bodigrim) and honestly I don't know how he finds the time to contribute new awesome features while also doing a tons of work on upgrading the entire ecosystem!
 Anway, I hope you enjoy dr-cabal and you can have more insights into compilation times of your Haskell project dependencies! 🤗

 Recently I was programming in Python and needed to use match/case construction. I found out that Emacs doesn't highlight those words. I thought that they aren't in keywords list and decided to make PR about it onto Emacs git repo. But as it turned out, match/case were already defined as keywords in python.el that was stored in the repo. So I looked at installed on my machine python.el and I saw that it was actually outdated and there were no those words in the list.
 I'm using latest version of Emacs. Could you tell me please, why is that happened and how to fix that properly (i mean, i shouldn't just manually replace my outdated python.el with newer one, should i?)
 Also sorry for possible misspellings 'cause English isn't my native language and sorry for stupid question, I'm newbie :)

This note is focussed on stating the problem.
Feel free to comment, improve on the note -- both on the formalities and the content of the note.
202211150901 Operationalization problem of memory
operationalization #memory
What memory is depends on how you test it. If you understand memory merely as the ability to parrot something that you have stored, memory is something completely different than if you are talking about availability. Do I have a good memory if I can name the back of an index card, but I can't access its contents when I'm supposed to be using it?
Memorization takes into account a small part of this problem: It is a common recommendation that one practice "Active Recall" and not merely repeat the material (e.g., by reading through it several times).
After "Active Recall", the key is to make content available when you actually need it, not just in the test situation. There is a difference between memory and the repertoire at one's disposal.
But it is difficult to operationalize the situation of actual use.
Thesis: You should start with simple memory techniques and then work your way up to more complex ones.

 Recently I started learning Rust and before that I was coding with Python and Nodejs which was absolutely fantastic on emacs. But on Rust I'm having a wierd scrolling lag/delay/stuttering issue even with small files. Everything is working like auto completion, lsp and such but couldn't find why it's lagging on rust files
 here is my config on rust+lsp:
 (after! rustic (setq rustic-lsp-server 'rust-analyzer) ) (after! lsp-mode (setq lsp-enable-symbol-highlighting nil) (setq lsp-diagnostics-provider :none) (lsp-diagnostics--enable) (setq lsp-signature-auto-activate nil) (setq lsp-signature-render-documentation nil) (setq lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable t) (setq lsp-completion-show-detail nil) (setq lsp-log-io nil) (setq lsp-completion-provider :capf) (setq lsp-modeline-diagnostics-scope :file) (setq lsp-enable-file-watchers nil) (setq lsp-idle-delay 0.500) (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1 company-idle-delay 0.5) ) 
 and lsp doctor output:
 Checking for Native JSON support: OK Check emacs supports `read-process-output-max': OK Check `read-process-output-max' default has been changed from 4k: OK Byte compiled against Native JSON (recompile lsp-mode if failing when Native JSON available): OK `gc-cons-threshold' increased?: OK Using `plist' for deserialized objects? (refer to https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/performance/#use-plists-for-deserialization): OPTIONAL Using emacs 28+ with native compilation?: OK

 When you send an PGP encrypted mail with Mutt, the Subject line gets protected. Which means that in the headers, the Subject is replaced by "....", and the "real" Subject line is moved to the encrypted part of the email message.
 When receiving a message with a protected header, upon decryption Mutt recognizes the "real" Subject line and shows that in the list of messages.
 Does Gnus support any of thexe options? I have been searching for "protected header" but haven't found anything, but perhaps my search capabilities may not be good enough ...

 Is something like that possible in emacs, for child frames etc? If not, is there a specific limitation that hinders it.
 I know it's something entirely preferential, but would be fascinating to know if it could be done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently learned to use lenses and experimented with various setups. I'm mostly concerned about the Haskell record namespacing issues; this gist from 2017 offers a makeFields (& variants) based solutions but requires centralizing lens declarations which I'm not a fan of. It forces you to extract out datatype declarations from their Module into Module.Types or Types.Module to avoid circular dependencies, which is time-consuming and adds avoidable complexity to the project's directory structure.
 I've written a short guide showing:
  
The detailed pros and cons of using generic-lens, DuplicateRecordFields, OverloadedRecordDot and NoFieldSelectors
 The minimum code required to use take advantage of those tools
  
If you're looking for a modern lens setup or way to deal with Haskell's record namespacing problem I recommend checking out this guide. I've tried to make this guide beginner-friendly so I think it should be a decent reference to start using lenses for the first time.

 If you have any correction or suggestion I will gladly add them to the tutorial!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm going to start over. I've got mu4e working with reading multiple email addresses, I've got contexts I can send from, and I've got random bugs and gotchas that I'll never find in the rats nest of read-envelope-from sendmail-extra-arguments and other options. Bonus points if the guide explains what the options are doing.
 All the guides I've gone through seem to run out of steam before actually sending and responding to email -- it's all... look, I configured IMAP... and for gmail cause that's hard. But responding to an email and automatically changing the from: based on the to:, etc are barely touched on. (currently my to: lines gets overriden by my from: lol -- the amount of side-effects from any change are massive).
 ​
 TL;DR: I'd love a complete guide for setting up multiple email addresses, that includes responding to emails and sending from the correct account with the correct .sig etc. (The stuff generic clients do automatically)
 ​
 Thanks. I've spent an ungodly amount of time on this. You'd think these packages would include 1 complete example that you could pair down to your needs, rather than parsing blogs from the last 20 years and seeing what still exists, what actually works, and then checking out the random bugs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing with Scala, trying to see if I like it and if I am willing to invest more time into it. I would like to use the cfor macro from Spire in a numerical code snippet where performance is important, but how should I do it? The canonical way seems to be to add the library to the build.sbt file, but here I am not writing a full project, I am just playing with the REPL to get a taste of the language, so there is no build.sbt file. Surely there must be some easier way to use libraries, right?
 (And, in general, if one just wants to have fun solving problems from "Project Euler", so just writing code snippets in the REPL, or in some light text editor and then compiling them, how does one do it? It seems that the first steps in the Scala world must be Coursier, SBT, Maven etc., which makes things very professional and kills all the geekish fun. Is there a way to avoid them? Downloading the standalone Scala compiler is easy, but how does one deal with foreign libraries?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I want to manipulate an Svg tree and then want to render it. Is there any good library supporting most of the Svg components and I can get the coordinates, size info of any component in the Svg? 
 Basically I will be changing the tree and some of the changes are depending on the sizes and locations of the elements inside. The library may not provide rendering, if I’m getting Svg text back, that’s enough for me. 
 Thanks

 For every context the value is t, with the previous value being set to the correct value from the context. So the context is setting it, and then it's getting clobbered to t.
 I don't set mail-signature anywhere else, and don't think I can set a breakpoint on a var, so does anyone have a clue where else mail-signature could get set from? (I'm checking in the compose window, so .msmtprc shouldn't matter since I'm not actually sending yet).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone know of any online courses/MOOCs that use Haskell but aren't dedicated to learning Haskell? I'm looking for a course where the content is about an interesting, language agnostic concept (databases, networking, compilers, anything really) and the course just happens to use Haskell as the language for the projects. A course where knowledge of Haskell is a prerequisite, not a goal. My searches so far have only returned results for the latter.
 I took an OCaml class in college, and I've worked through some Haskell books. I'm at the point where a "learn Haskell" course wouldn't provide much benefit to me. I'd like to apply my knowledge to a real project, but for some reason I'm just not creative enough to come up with personal projects out of thin air. Looking for a more guided/structured way to build an actual Haskell project.

 Is this a documentation error or user error? I just want to be able to use unboxed vectors for a newtype newtype X = X Int.
 The full example, copied verbatim from the above link, as follows:
 ``` :set -XTypeFamilies -XStandaloneDeriving -XMultiParamTypeClasses -XGeneralizedNewtypeDeriving

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often have two side by side windows and, in my case, the right one shows the output of something in the left one (an error, or the result of a function). I'll want to see that error or output and then get back t my side by side arrangement and continue right where I am in the first. Currently, I switch to the other window with ace-window o (C-x o in my case) then mazimize that one with zoom-window-zoom (bound to z in my case). The nice thing with zoom-window-zoom is that it toggles... so z again unmazimizes the window. Then I C-x o again to get back to the first window. So, to fill my screen with the other window: C-x o, z, z, C-x o. Muscle memory at this point. But I want to be able to hit one key and maximize the other window, and hit it again to unmaximize the other window, and have my pointer where it was in the first window at the end. I'm not attached to ace-window or zoom-window-zoom... they were just what I happened across. I realize this may be more complicated if I have more than two windows open, but I very seldom do. Thoughts? And Thanks!
 PS - I have a lot of rebindings so knowing the command a suggested binding invokes is helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My understanding of elisp is very basic. I am going through lsp-verilog.el of `lsp-mode` package . I see 2 lsp clients are registered, both for major verilog-mode, with different priority values (-1, -2).
 Note that Emacs recognizes "\\.[ds]?va?h?\\'" as verilog-mode, which includes both verilog (i.e., *.v) and SystemVerilog (i.e., *.sv, *.sva) files.
 "hdl_checker" works for both Verilog and SystemVerilog files. so when I open ".sv" file `:server-id 'lsp-verilog` (i.e., hdl_checker) is initialized by default. 
 How do I switch between svlangserver and hdl_checker for systemverilog (.sv, *.sva)?
 Thank you for your time.
 Update: there is a workaround solution here

 The problem: when I use M-k (or M-x kill-sentence), it deletes the entire paragraph. To put it another way, on my Emacs (28.1) M-x kill-sentence does the same exact thing as M-x kill-paragraph.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, get-tested is a CLI tool that reads your cabal file and takes the tested-with stanza to generate a build matrix for GitHub Actions. It's fairly basic at the moment but I've already migrated a couple of projects to it, and it really is nice to have. Positive points:
  
You have one source of truth regarding the supported compiler versions for your projects: your cabal file. 
 No codegen is involved! You do not have to occasionally re-generate your CI file, which means that you can keep all the peculiarities and weird hacks you used to have. This tool only concerns itself with providing a list of OS and GHC versions. Some of which you can still exclude in the action file.
  
Coincidentally (or not), the next release of Flora will bring this stanza to the forefront (see associated announcement).
 Since the idea is to really be intertwined with the Haskell Github Action, the list of supported compiler is shared between this tool, the setup action and Flora.
 My thanks to David Christiansen for the idea of the CLI tool. The idea for it is to both disappear inside the future cabal status command, and that it becomes part of the official Haskell actions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The variable gc-cons-threshold is the threshold beyond which Emacs will run garbage collection. So if more memory is allocated than this (in bytes) the garbage collector runs. The default value is 800000 - just 7.6MiB! Starting Emacs and looking at gcs-done gives 67 for me (the garbage collector has run 67 times) and (emacs-init-time) gives "5.464376 seconds".
 At the start of my init.el, I've put:
 ;; Don't collect garbage while initialising. (setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum) 
 And at the end:
 (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 1024 1024 100)) ; 100 MiB 
 You could also put (garbage-collect) at the end to collect garbage if that tickles your fancy.
 Now gcs-done is 12 (for some reason), and (emacs-init-time) is "3.598263 seconds", which is a decent improvement of nearly two seconds. I have a very heavy and badly-written configuration file, so I need all the help I can get 🙂.
 You could probably get away with higher values of gc-cons-threshold, but bear in mind that the larger the threshold, the rarer the garbage collection, but the longer it takes. So you might end up with tiny but noticeable pauses while you're typing, which would be annoying. Not sure about that so it's worth experimenting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello dear Scala community !
 I have a very dumb ( or not, I am not sure ) question.
 Recently at work we kinda started a debate on how to handle errors in our applications : we use tapir + http4s and cats-effect's IO everywhere and current urrent practice is to throw everything in the IO's error channel and eventually catch it somewhere upstream. 
 But by switching to mainly using http4s clients to sttp clients to communi6between our services we often find our business logic kinda sandwiched between a source of data producing IO[Either[E,A]] and an API description which expects the same.
 Lifting everything into the IO error channel to caste it again into the same input shape seems to be a waste of information and effort, while also not getting any help from the compiler to handle those errors. This kinda leads me to lean toward using EitherTs....which is metwith some resistance as it does tend to add some complexity to the code.
 In this context I found out about this wonderful article https://guillaumebogard.dev/posts/functional-error-handling/ which seemed to reflect exactly my own...erm...reflexions. After reading it, I thought I found the perfect middle ground ! Put errors not in the output type of your functions, but give it the capability to fail thru MonadError from cats and Raise from cats-mtl. Maybe lift everything into a neat context function type an bam everyone is happy.
 I started experimenting. Everything was very neat and tidy until....and here comes my dumb question....where do I get MonadError and Raise instances for IO ? Is there another lib ?
 I found tofu which seems to cover pretty much anything I need but they don't publish for scala 3. Do I have to rewrite both for the IO monad ?

(setq nums (list 1 3 2 6 5 4 0)) ⇒ (1 3 2 6 5 4 0)
 (sort nums #'<) ⇒ (0 1 2 3 4 5 6)
 nums ⇒ (1 2 3 4 5 6)
  
Well, I understand this because it is a linked list and nums points to the cell that contains 1. To get the sorted list, we have to store the result back: (setq nums (sort nums #'<)).
 However, with doing this it said:
  
Most often we store the result back into the variable that held the original list
  
It's "Most often". So it means it's not 100% reliable, right? And why is that? I suppose sorting a list is a fundamental functionality in most languages. If it's not 100% reliable, what is the best practice to sort a list in elisp?
 Thank you!

However, I have so much headlines that it takes some effort to narrow them down (headlines with similar words, so I end up parsing through lines of headlines to dig for what I'm looking for).
 Some headlines I don't need to org-goto-all, but I still it to use it as a headline for styling and if I'm in the file, org-goto is still useful.
 For my purposes, perhaps excluding headlines from an entire file and then whitelisting some significant headlines I want to org-goto-all is perfect. I've also heard of people having performance issues from too many headlines, so being able to exclude some from org-goto-all should alleviate this and allow quicker way of finding what I want. I could split into more files and just jump to them and org-goto, but I have a massive todo.org file and it has content relevant to what I'm looking for in addition to notes in a file-specific file if it has one. 
 I'm open to any approaches as well. I use org-ql/org-super-agenda but only as a custom org agenda (it's from a template that I tweaked a little, I don't know any elisp).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: My user-mail-address is properly ["me@mydomain.com](mailto:"jason@mailjason.com)" when I'm in the compose buffer (context triggered). And then when I C-c C-c to send it comes from the wrong (default) email address... even though the name part stays correct. So somehow the email to send from is getting clobbered at send time.
 ​
 I've tried so many things with various results, I know people will want all my configs but I'm just wondering where else to look that can potentially cause a clobbering. message-sendmail-envelope-from set to nil to make sure user-mail-address used -- but nothing seems to matter from the sending side. (using msmtp on the send side)
 ​
 Thanks for any and all info. Or maybe just a guide that focuses on sending from multiple emails -- all the guides seem to say to skip right over the sending side of multiple emails and aliases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, in some projects it's nice to have some kind of sql browser, but in emacs I couldn't find one and I had to leave emacs for that. So I wrote a little python code in org mode blocks (why not a .py file? just because I like org) to create another .org document with the sql database tables for a quick overview and not having to exit emacs. So now I like to build a function in emacs-lisp to execute the code blocks in the org mode file to automatically generate the tables when you call it, but I'm very new to emacs-lisp and don't know where to start. Any suggestions for that? . 
 Is there a package that does something similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 I am trying to find a way to replicate the bracket behavior to the dollar sign symbols (just as if $$ was something like {}).
 This is because I use org-mode to write math notes with a lot of latex sections and most of these latex "windows" are done by surrounding the piece of text with dollar signs.
 eg: $\alpha\beta latex things$.
 Of course the best would be to have a way of setting this to any kind of couple of symbols or symbol combinations.
 For example in latex it would be immensely useful to do it on \{ and \}.
 Does someone know how to approach this?
 I use doom emacs if that matters, but I hope that a solution might be helpful to whoever needs it as well.
 Thank you a lot.

 I found the function mu4e-view-save-attachments and it asks me which part I want to save, but then nothing happens.
 I thought at one point there was a key that would force it to save rather than open, but I can't seem to find it now. Anyone?

Why are these guys leaving ?
 Don't they know just how amazing Scala 3 changes are ? They should just upgrade to Scala 2.13... then 3.0... then 3.1... then 3.2. Joke is on them. They will miss out on all new awesomeness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question about the undo and redo workflow (mostly org-roam). Undo often deletes a lot of changes for me. There doesn't seem to be any caching of steps between escaping.
 Example:
  
Write code and an explanation below.
 I mark the code to copy it, but when I hit "y" there is only this little y where the code once was. Forgot to escape.
 When I now use undo, the whole text resets to an almost ancient state, sometimes from 10-30 minutes ago.
 So I have to redo-undo.
 Now I'm still stuck with the y instead of the code and I have two options: 
 Type all again from the ancient state.
 Type the code again, I accidentally deleted by pressing y without escaping first.
 
  
Is there any way I can prevent this time-consuming mess? It can't be that everyone who works with Emacs constantly loses text / code and hours of work. So the fault must be on my side.
 I read through the undo chapter of Emacs and a few threads here in Emacs on reddit. (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Undo.html). But I can't really make sense of it.
 How do you prevent this from happening? What is your workflow for undo and redo?
 I am very grateful for any help.

 Is there any way to specify value of tab-width for specific columns?For example, I would like to have tab for first column be 4, for second it would be 10, for third it can be 2 and so on.
 I checked the csv-mode, but the files that I am working on are not pure .tsv.
 First part of the file is actually free text, then there are tab separated values. So aligning the columns with csv-mode creates veeery long columns(which is totally unreadable), due to long lines of text in the beginning.

 What am I doing wrong? Is there something I misunderstood? I'm new to PureScript, but have some experience with functional languages.
 Edit: Never mind, after decoding Json to User, I forgot to change the serialisation function from stringify :: Json -> String to show which uses the inherited Show instance of the record...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand the difference/overlap between the transformers and mtl libraries. I've found a lot of information, most of which seems to be like 10 years out-of-date. Depending on the year, the advice has ranged from "definitely use mtl" to "definitely use transformers" to "it doesn't matter, they're basically the same thing".
 So here's my noobed-up interpretation of the current situation, what I've managed to glean:
 mtl is (now?) built on top of transformers, so they are in that sense "compatible". However, mtl provides some "extra stuff".
 So my questions:
  
Is that basic summary more-or-less correct?
 ...and if so, what is the "extra stuff" that mtl provides? I've read the docs, a few wikis, and a whole pile of stack overflow threads, but still am not clear. (Some type classes, I think?) Practically speaking, why choose mtl over transformers?
  
I've only used transformers so far, but am not sure exactly what I'm missing. I appreciate any pointers!

 However, doing this a few times, I end up with a lot of org-roam buffers clogging up my other buffer list. I see the names generally start with a YYYYMMDD.... prefix, and end in the standard .org suffix - I see that there is a consult-buffer-filter option, but that wouldn't be completely sufficient due to the non-standard name of these files (it'd be nice if I could ensure they all are prefixed with "or-" or some such).
 Even better would be if I could also exclude them from my recentf list, but I'm hoping for the buffers currently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Not sure whether this should be handled at Scotty level or at Docker level, but my problem is the following:
 I've set up Docker and Nginx reverse proxy on a hosted Debian VPS. I'm successfully hosting multiple websites with SSL on this VPS, including an application built with Scotty.
 The app is basically just an editor in which you can write programs in a DSL I implemented. When you press "Run", the contents of the editor is sent to the backend as a POST request, and the program is evaluated server-side. The server then responds with the result.
 The problem arises in the fact that the DSL in question allows for infinite loops. Thus, when the backend evaluates the given program, it might not terminate. When this happens, the app is down for at least a minute seconds and the process consumes ~100% of the CPU on the server.
 Is there a reliable way (in my current Linux/Docker/Scotty stack) to automatically kill the process if it runs for more than, say, 8 seconds?
 What I've tried so far:
  
Setting a timeout of 8 seconds using scottyOpts
 Defining a health check in the Dockerfile that runs every 30 seconds
  
The health check helps in the sense that it automatically restarts the container if the service does not respond, but this still yields significant downtime.
 Let me know if the post does not fit the sub.
 Cheers!

 (use-package elpy :ensure t :init (elpy-enable)) 
 I haven't figured out where to put this that doesn't throw an error on doom sync. Because I'm using doom, I have an ~/.emacs.d/ and a ~/.doom.d, which each contain various init.el and packages.el files. The packages file in .doom.d indicates packages are installable via:
 ;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror: ;; (package! some-package) (package! elpy) 
 So I've done that, and run doom sync and reloaded Doom. It seems now that elpy is installed in a half state. There are many elpy commands available in M-x such as elpy-doc, elpy-menu, elpy-test, but the reason I installed this package is that I want to be able to navigate to e.g. Widgets(foo=bar, baz=qux) in a Python file and jump to definition, which isn't working - M-. instead outputs an error, "Previous command was not evil-repeat".

 For example if you look at the screenshot here which shows lsp-tailwindcss providing a completion list.
 What is weird is sometimes I get the list but only after a huge time delay. If I do completion-at-point, I get a list instantly but it is in the mini buffer and not displayed like the referenced image.
 I don't know a reasonable method of debugging this and figuring out what is wrong.

 Ideally I'd do it using `.dir-locals.el` or `dir-locals-set-class-variables` one level above all the git repos. However it seems as soon as Emacs finds one configuration it stops looking up the directory structure. So if I have project-specific .dir-locals.el I'd need to copy my overrides from level above.
 Is there a standard way to do this? Am I missing something? I didn't even notice any mention that Emacs stops looking as soon as it finds one in the docs (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html) or anywhere else.
 The closest thing I found was this https://github.com/jinnovation/nested-dir-locals.el

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use the emms-status package to get a nice-looking description of the currently playing track in the mode line. It mostly works -- track name, artist, year, and current timestamp -- but I can't see how long the current track is. 
  
 I think the problem is that the emms-track-get function doesn't retrieve the info-playing-time key/variable. I can test this by editing the emms-track-description-function to try to retrieve info-playing-time, but the track listings in a playlist buffer do not show this. 
  
 Is there any way to fix this? I'm using emms-player-mpv as the only player, could that be the origin of this issue?

 But the English in my comments and docstrings are not checked.
 I'm not sure how I can archive that? Maybe it is to complex or not a good idea to activate flake8-code-checking and docstring-spellchecking at the same time?
 I would also accept a solution where I have to activate the spell checking manually.
 I'm not sure which one of the components are responsible here? Can eglot do something like that? OR do I have to configure the language server behind? Or is it totally in depended from the python-eglot-configuration?
 I'm not sure if this would help, but if you want I could post the relevant parts of my init.el here.

 I get that tramp was built for maximum flexibility over tramp remotes, but for the most common cases, would having a server running on the remote side be able to speed things up, and perhaps provide server to emacs communication too?
 Vscode has a remote component, which I believe is written in nodejs and runs on the places nodejs runs.

 So I appreciate that this would be a very dangerous thing to do and breaks referential transparency... but I have my reasons. If there is a fundamental misunderstanding here of why this is impossible within the Haskell runtime an explanation would be great!

 I recently updated mu4e from version 1.6.x to 1.8.x and I'm having problems to see mails that only contain a html part, they simply don't render (I tried to change the default shr render). I actually had the same problem with my 1.6.x version but you could opt for the old render (mu4e-view-use-old) which worked fine for me. 
 Any suggestions?

I now know the basics of Haskell(at least I think I do), so what exactly I can build in Haskell, what is it mainly used for, and what are some distant goals we can achieve with Haskell? Can I build GUI apps in it? Is there anything similar to electron or Tauri in Haskell? is there any TUI-related things in Haskell? is there anything else I can do using it? I like this language a lot and would like to learn the rest of it by building things. Would appreciate some projects and frameworks suggestions along with any relative knowledge you guys deem worthy to know.

My team has a project that involves stream processing coming up where we will be using the Kafka Streams API. I thought this is the perfect time to introduce Kotlin and encourage a switch from Java. I really loved Kotlin specifically for its hybrid OOP/functional approach and for its null-safety. It was easy to learn for me because I was familiar with Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript and it seems to combine a lot of great features from those languages as well as introducing great features of its own.
 However, I'm being told by organization leadership and more experienced coworkers that Scala is what we should use. I know these people have very little experience -- if any -- using …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a case where I use re-search-backward looking for something akin to "[[:blank:]][[:alpha:]]". While the leading whitespace is syntactically significant, it's actually the location of [[:alpha:]] that I am interested in.
 So given a few examples that for the sake of the example all start at buffer pos 1000:
 A) " blabla"
 B) " blabla"
 C) "blabla"
 re-search-backward would correctly return 1000 for both A and B, but it's actually the return values of 1 and 3 that I really want here. I can't just remove the [[:blank:]] because I don't want to match C where there is no leading whitespace.
 So I'm wondering if there is any alternative function or grouping trick where I can search backwards for a regex but get the position of a specific group in the regex back, or similar to font-lock-keywords be able to specify a regex for leading/surrounding text.
 Similarly, given the same example A I would like to use looking-at if the point is at position 1. For now I use (and (looking-at "[[:alpha:]]") (looking-back "[[:blank:]]))

This makes me think that people don't normally ToJSON their actual models, but instead create specific ViewModels that they then map to the actual models in a Servant handler. Is this correct?
 I also consider doing some JSON -> Haskell code gen, since reverse engineering what the JSON is going to look like from a Haskell type is not obvious to me. Say a type like
 data Test = Test Int Int
 If you use Servant, what are your experiences?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not going to switch over to vi bindings, but in exploring how the other 2/3 lives, I've grown disenchanted with Emacs's keybindings for (backward-char) and (backward-word). For decades, I've used <left> and M-<left> for those navigation commands, but as I've moved away from the arrow keys in favor of C|M-{f, n, p} , I've found the b variant more and more irritating. For me, C- is caps-lock and M- sits just below x. In both cases, combining them with b makes for a very weird hand shape.
 vi's h,j,k,l navigation is interesting, but n,p make more sense to me than j,k and I use C-h, C-l and M-l enough to not want to remap them.
 I'm interested to hear about solutions to this thorn from people who don't use vi bindings.

In fact, it’s better than any of the rubbish they shovel at you, but let’s not get too evangelistic. I’m running Doom Emacs on a Mac (using Macports as a package manager), and although there are some guides out there on getting Emacs to work with Unity, most of them didn’t get everything working for me, so I thought I’d write this guide to help others out. To use Emacs effectively with Unity means setting up LSP Mode integration. In order to do that, you’ll need a language server for C# and a way to generate .csproj files. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to test if the former is working without having the latter up and running. Let’s set up project file generation first.

 round' :: Double -> Integer -> Double round' num sgnf = (fromIntegral . round $ num * f) / f where f = 10^sgnf 
 And I'd like to nail down exactly why the fromIntegral is needed. The obvious thing to do is find out what types round is dealing with, i.e., round :: (RealFrac a, Integral b) => a -> b , and then assume it doesn't work to try to divide the outcome of round by a integer. And don't be fooled when the naked literals, e.g., 844.666 / 100 do work, since it's really fromRational 844.666/fromInteger 100. Which is not what (round $ num * f) / f is giving us. So round results in an Integral, (round 844.666 :: Integral b => b) , which needs to be passed to fromIntegral. But now I'm confused. Integral is a class. Can someone explain exactly what's going on here?

I don't know if I've overlooked an easier way to do this (I've tried a few) but I've settled on the following method using advice, I thought I'd share this in case it's useful (or if there's a better way out there).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: to make it clear, I am asking whether anyone knows of a mode that would be better than lisp-mode.
 I'm currently using lisp-mode for The Knowledge Machine .km files, but it is not indenting things the way the documentation shows it. For example, this is how the handbook represents the following:
 (parts has (instance-of (Slot)) (domain (Physobj)) (range (Physobj)) (cardinality (1-to-N)) (inverse (part-of)) (subslots (mechanical-parts body-parts))) (mechanical-parts has (instance-of (Slot)) (superslots (parts))) (wheel-count has (instance-of (Slot)) (domain (Vehicle)) (range (Integer)) (cardinality (N-to-1))) 
 but when I indent the region containing it in lisp-mode, I get:
 (parts has (instance-of (Slot)) (domain (Physobj)) (range (Physobj)) (cardinality (1-to-N)) (inverse (part-of)) (subslots (mechanical-parts body-parts))) (mechanical-parts has (instance-of (Slot)) (superslots (parts))) (wheel-count has (instance-of (Slot)) (domain (Vehicle)) (range (Integer)) (cardinality (N-to-1))) 
 the problem (stuff pushed way out to the right) is worse for concepts that have longer names than wheel-count. I'm sure that there must be, if not a dedicated KM mode that I simply cannot find, an existing mode that can be customized to produce the handbook formatting, but I can't find it.
 Edit 2: added a couple of more example declarations, all from page 12 of the KM user manual (pdf).

for greater efficiency at runtime, as some computations would have already been

staged programming is the exponential function: to compute a^b, if b is
known at compile time, a^b can be replaced by b explicit
multiplications. Staged programming allows you to write
a^5, but have the expression compile to a*a*a*a*a.
In Haskell, the traditional way to do staged programming is to
reach for Template Haskell. Template Haskell
is, after all, designed for this purpose and gives you strong

 I see no reference to send from or reply-to in any of the setups. Manually editing the from: line when sending from mu4e does nothing… the from and reply lines are just overwritten to whatever I have set for sending email. 
 Thanks for any help or pointing me to appropriate resources. (Setting up on Mac now, but will be xplat).

 I have created a library to manage property trees in Emacs. It started as a package to support some personal elisp projects but then I thought that it could be useful also to somebody else, so I have written an hopefully decent piece of documentation for it.
 You can find it on Melpa and on Github.
 Any feedback would be appreciated.
 Thanks,

 I'm very excited to announce release 3.12 of Copilot. Copilot is a stream-based DSL for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones. It also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for the requirements elicitation tool FRET (https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/fret/), via Ogma (https://github.com/nasa/ogma).

It took a few minutes to get working (use stack with lts-14.21, have a "synopsis" field in .cabal file), but I really like the aesthetic of the docs, the ease of use (markdown files, latex support, runs Haskell in markdown docs). 
 The only downside is that it doesn't seem to be maintained, and doesn't work for ghc 9.
 If the authors are reading this, did they get discouraged from maintaining it because of low adoption, and how hard do they think it would be for me to update it? I'd absolutely love to use it instead of sphinx for the monad-bayes docs that I wrote here, but that library uses ghc 9

 How can I install layouts in emacs? I cannot seem to find an individual mode for it? 
 Or is it custom to space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it just me, or does anyone else feel like learning elisp involves using an inordinate number of anti-patterns? For example, I was trying to figure out how to call a function that could create a new org entry from an org template, with certain values passed in as parameters. I kept running into a wall, until I realized that I needed to set a global variable to a plist containing the values, and then access those values using elisp in the template. This would be a sure sign that someone doesn’t know what the hell they’re doing in any other language I know of, but it seems to just be how things work in the EMacs/elisp world. I can only imagine how bad my code would be if I learned by hacking on EMacs…. 
 Is this just a function of EMacs being an older system that was developed before more best practices were developed? Is there some other justification for doing things this way? Or am I overblowing how often things work like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just realized that I had a heated debate last year at a local LUG meetup here in China with one of the most active Archlinux package maintainers (whose name some of you probably know but I'd rather not mention) about the status quo of Haskell on Archlinux. It was a painful and long debate; I didn't post anything immediately after, but now that I think about it the debate eventually boiled down to, as I called it,
 A BROKEN PACKAGE IS BETTER THAN AN INSECURE PACKAGE. 
 If Haskell cannot manage to (at least pretend to) successfully update a dynamic library dependency without recompilation and/or large-scale ad-hoc per-package manual patching and/or 100x performance penalty due to uneliminated indirection, then it's Haskell's fault for doing so. Packages in other languages can get broken by security patches as well; it's just that they often (at least pretend to) work and Haskell breaks too often.
 I never realized that security patches are his first and foremost concern since he never seemed to have expressed that explicitly regarding this issue. But now it has all come together.

 This feature is originated from the awesome guys from emacs-ng (kind-of hibernated now). I extracted the WebRender related work into a new repo and made some small changes. Now it can be built and run under macOS, which supposed to works on all main platforms.
 Well, Linux build seems more solid. On macOS, I realized some issues I'll just drop it here hoping some macOS Emacs guys wants to improve it. Haven't tested on Windows.

 Crash after switching to background
  
This configuration option I am using on macOS
 ./configure --with-wr --without-ns --with-gnutls=ifavailable CFLAGS="-Wno-implicit-function-declaration"

 For Guix user on Linux I have emacs-next-wr definition here.
 This is demo video on macOS.

I know basic key chords, and I've started messing around with org mode, and I have a couple functions and keybinds in my init.el (all copy-pasted from the internet, of course). But I feel like there's a gap yet to be bridged, and I don't know where to start, because I don't feel I truly understand emacs. 
 In short, what do I have to do to progress beyond being an emacs beginner? What resources should I use? When will I be able to use emacs for everything?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's what I'm trying to do:
 I've been using relative line numbers, which are great for moving x amount of lines up/down, especially in large files. On occasion, though, I'll need to move to a specific line number (for example, if reading about a line from documentation or an error buffer). In those situations, I want to see all the absolute line numbers. My solution has been:
 (advice-add 'goto-line-read-args :before (lambda () (setq display-line-numbers 'absolute))) (advice-add 'goto-line :after (lambda (_LINE &optional _BUFFER _RELATIVE) (setq display-line-numbers 'relative))) 
 This works perfectly. However, some times I change my mind after calling goto-line, and decide to do something else instead. When I quit out of goto-line (C-g), the second advice doesn't get run and I'm stuck with absolute line numbers. Obviously it's not much of a pain to set them back to relative, but I'm wondering if there's a way to do it automatically.
 I'm also asking because I'm trying to get more familiar with how the advising functionality works, and I'd like to understand if there's a way to get out the quit issue. It seems to me that sometimes there are advices that need to run, even if the function has been quit. Is there a way to make sure that happens?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I programmed in Haskell for many years, but eventually switched to Rust a few years ago on the lure of it being a kind of poor man's functional language, but with absolutely kickass performance. 
 The syntax is atrocious, but the compiler is almost magical, with the generated assembly resembling nothing like what I wrote in Rust (which looks more Haskelly than Rusty, with my indoctrination into Haskell years ago ...), but like what I might write directly in assembly. At this point, I am surprised when it doesn't optimize like this. 
 I never did see is kind of performance in Haskell. Despite my best efforts, when I rewrite in Haskell, it rarely gets any faster than 0.1x to 0.3x the speed of the Rust equivalent. When you need the speed and not just the language niceties, this is depressing.
 Does Haskell/GHC have a chance at hitting this kind of performance? Is it a matter of manpower/mindpower/time, or are there fundamental limitations that make this practically impossible?

 i need to go through a list of strings and if a String is an integer number (for example 78) it will be changed into the tuple ("Number", 78), and if it contains just text (for example the word "trees") it will be changed into the tuple ("Text", "Trees")
 to keep it simple assume that any string passed into the function can only be integers or just plain text, but they are all Strings

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy! I originally posted this question on r/linux, and it was suggested to post it here as well.
 I'm installing Gentoo, and I'm looking at either StumpWM or EXWM as a WM, and I'm leaning toward EXWM simply because Emacs. However, I'm sure there's a lot I don't know about the comparison between them. I'm wondering if you nice folks might share your insights.
 I use Emacs a lot, and plan on using it more and more as I get my config dialed in. I'm fully invested in Emacs, and consider it to be part of the OS, so I'll be using it either way. I think having more stuff in Emacs is nothing but handy. I will be using this setup on several PCs, including a crappy laptop, a gaming laptop, and a few desktops. Gaming is the main thing I'm worried about. I just use KDE on the gaming laptop for now.
 I'm also interested in programming, specifically in Lisp. I'm leaning more toward Common Lisp, which is what StumpWM is written in. Of course EXWM is Emacs Lisp, but that's kind of Emacs-specific and wouldn't be used for other software development. I've also considered learning scheme because I have a copy of SICP, but that's taters under the skillet.
 Finally, I'm a few months away from getting going on managing a homelab. None of the servers will run this system, but all of the management will be done through it on my main PC. I will be doing a lot of multitasking, troubleshooting, remote-management, security stuff, note-taking, etc.
 So, in a nutshell, I'm wondering: - What can StumpWM do that EXWM can't do? - What can EXWM do that StumpWM can't do? - What are the major limitations of each, specifically when compared to one another? - How will each compare when stacked against the things I want to use it for? - How does the ecosystem for each one compare? I know the Emacs ecosystem decently well, but not StumpWM's. Are there many plugins / extensions? Are there many users communicating regularly with each other?

 I don't want to read a bunch of vim tutorials only to find out they use a bunch of packages that work different than evil. And I'm looking for the common editing operations that aren't included in evil, like parens or s-exp manipulation.

 The images are being saved in a new folder in the same directory as the org file and not in my ~/org/references/notes/images/ anymore.

Yes, emacswiki mentions 2 repositories from which one may install such newer Emacs versions, so this post is partly intended as an exercise of getting to know Debian's packaging tools.
 Note, it doesn't seem easily possible to compile Emacs 28.2 on Debian 9, so I had to upgrade one of my machines to Debian 10 for this to work.
 To compile and install the Emacs packages except for the info manual:
 mkdir -p ~/src/deb/ cd ~/src/deb/ git clone https://salsa.debian.org/rlb/deb-emacs.git cd deb-emacs/ sudo apt install packaging-dev # For quilt, etc. # Edit files to use gcc-10 and related packages instead of gcc-12: sed -i 's#gcc-12#gcc-10#' debian/control debi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a long research I came to the conclusion that probably the best way to build Haskell projects is to use Nix + Cabal as described in this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/7h8np7/stack_or_cabal_which_one_is_more_preferable_for/dqp268b/ or https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/tvbrmp/stack_compared_to_cabalinstall/i38g4my/ and some blog posts around the internet.
 This gives you all the advantages like binary caches (no need to compile dependencies), incremental builds, non-Haskell dependencies and other things you would expect in a modern build system. Stack was an attempt in that direction but is generally considered inferior compared to Nix + Cabal.
 So why isn't there a tool that simply combines (or automates) the setup of a local nix environment + cabal + cabal2nix? 
 I think we could even achieve something like "npx" or "pipx" that allows us to run a Haskell application with just one command, e.g. "hpx pandoc" that installs and runs Haskell application for you on the fly.

 org-ql-search working terrific for me in searching agenda files and open buffers. However, am trying to figure how to search recursively in a specific directory and have that show up in the Buffers/Files: options along with org-agenda-files and org-directory.
 My org files folder structure is not flat, so the straight org-directory variable isn't working for me as I think searches only the folder specified.
 (I do use deft right now, which filters down files but the grouped results buffer of org-ql would be a lot more helpful)
 Any pointers very much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My use of org roam is pretty basic. The last couple months I was just using a journal, as the easist thing to do to build up some note taking muscle. The trouble with this is that for a given project, say, the notes for it are spread all over the file, I want to bring them together. Enter org roam.
 I have a file per entity (person, project, journal, interview) and most entries are dated. Each week I like to review whats gone on and write up some conclusions, using the journal this was easy, but now not so much.
 Is there a way to search my org dir, for a date range (last week), and pull together all of the matching nodes, and display them with the title and file tags from the orignal files? Been reading about consult this morning, and that sounds like a possible route, but figure I'd ask for some guidance. 
 I guess I could go the other way, just use a journal and tag each node, and pull together the entity nodes adhoc, but that would rely on being very consistent with tags, which seems more error prone to me. Happy for any tips if others go this route.

Since matrices correspond to linear mappings, we can also conclude that linear mappings form a noncommutative ring where the multiplication operation is function composition. What will the addition operation be? (Hint: it’s the linear mapping analogue of matrix addition.)
  
I guess it's the sum of two applications of linear mappings, like so: f(x) + g(x), where x is a matrix.
 Am I correct?

 (let* ((coll '(("Affenpinscher" . "Loyal and amusing") ("Akita" . "Ancient Japanese") ("Bulldog" . "Kind but courageous") ("Caucasian Shepherd" . "Serious guarding breed") ("Miniature Schnauzer" . "Long-lived and low-shedding"))) (completion-extra-properties '(:annotation-function (lambda (k) (let ((desc (alist-get k minibuffer-completion-table nil nil #'string=))) (format "\n\t%s" desc)))))) (completing-read "Select a breed: " coll)) 
 Evaling this snippet would display names of the dog breeds, along with annotated descriptions. And if I type "sheph", it would correctly narrow the search to "Caucasian Shepherd". But I also want to be able to type "long" and to find "Miniature Schnauzer", but sadly, it doesn't work that way. How can I change that?

 OrgModeClockingXBar - See what you are working on ;-) (if using orgmode clocking)
 I designed a hack to see your clocked-in task on your bar.
 The hack is composed of a few elements, Emacs code that adds hooks for clock-in and clock-out, a Python script to process a file with the Emacs output, and a code for Xbar.
 I have been using this for 2 years, and it's pretty robust. I didn't have time to share it before.
 The code is not perfect, if you quit your Emacs, without clocking-out the content of the file will not be changed so you will not see any update on the bar (at least not till next clocking-in or -out)

 I want to use Emacs as alternative to Xcode since text editting capability of Emacs is so powerfull and I got used to it.
 It seems there are several ways to do that but each one has some issues.
  
lsp-mode is broken for swift over a year. 
 lsp-sourcekit ;; completion stops working after lsp server returns an error #3028
 
 company-sourcekit and SourceKittenDaemon doesn't work for .xcworkspace 
 Support for xcworkspace #73
 
 eglot doesn't officially support Swift and doesn't have instruction to get it working. 
 konrad1977's comment on Swift support? #825 seems promissing though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I've been muscling my way through the various dated on-line guides, and reddit help has been so key... thank you... I'm almost there ;))
 mbsync successfully gets my email into ~/.maildir/myGmail/
 mu info shows maildir as ~/.maildir
 Email is indexed, I can run mu commands and see emails, etc.
 TL;DR: Invoking mu4e in emacs then makes the [Gmail] structure under ~/.maildir rather than using the already existing ~/.maildir/[Gmail]. (The effect is I can go to unread email, but can't jump to inbox or any directories because they aren't where the mail is, they show all empty since they're the new dirs mu4e made.)
 I have no idea where this would be coming from since I thought mu4e is just going to use the mu info. Also I was going to try to re-init mu with ~/.maildir/myGmail, but can't figure out how the hell to do (and seems like it won't work for multiple accounts anyway). I can't seem to kill mu (can't find the process), but trying to init says it may already be running.
 If you can point me toward additional info that would be great. I'm on mac homebrew emacs and mu. (Much thanks to u/FrostyX_cz blog post on getting mbsync up).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to all,
 I had the following idea: use org-mode as a chat. For exemple, if you would like to do the following: chat with someone who doesn't know org-mode well, via org-mode.
 That is, he would just have to call commands like "reply to this message", where each message could be a heading, and each file a topic of discussion. The files would be in a folder that would be shared. This would largely mirror the layout of reddit replies. 
 Edit and precision : a person A would not have to be logged in to receive B's message, just like on reddit or any other modern communication medium.
 ​
 Also, the power of org-mode could be used: combined with org-babel, org-attach, org-roam etc... that would be really cool.
 ​
 Is there a package to do this? If so which one? If not, would someone like to do it with me? Is it a good idea to make a package or is there an easier way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posting here as well as maybe one of you can help.
 I have a ZSA Moonlander keyboard. With their online configurator, I set up a key to run the Emacs macro "C-x b", that is "Press Ctrl-X, then press B".
 But when I use it, it emits "x" and "b" separately.
 I downloaded the source code for my firmware and it looks OK to me:
 case ST_MACRO_2: if (record->event.pressed) { SEND_STRING(SS_RCTL(SS_TAP(X_X)) SS_DELAY(100) SS_TAP(X_B)); } 
 Taps Right Ctrl with X, waits 100ms, then taps B. Which exactly what I want it to do.
 What am I missing? I tried inspecting the keyboard events and it still looks OK to me. Dump from evtest when I press that macro key: https://pastebin.com/fJp5kyR4
 Is it executed too fast for Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, first post here. I have been a happy emacs user since I knew about its existence and now I'm a even happier user of org. My question is about org's indent mode and custom themes. Apparently, org's indent mode creates the illusion of indentation by inserting dummy '*'s at the beginning of each sub-header, and making them invisible. When I switch custom themes, most themes do not consistently set colours in such a way that those dummy stars are invisible, that is, I guess, have the background colour. I am aware that custom themes cannot be undone by design, however, as a matter of fact, some themes do work consistently correctly with respect to indent mode, notably, all sanityinc's ones. Is it feasible to isolate the relevant feature of sanityinc's themes and replicate it in other themes to fix them?

 Emacs.bat:  wsl bash -c ". ~/.bash_profile && emacs %*" 
 (. bash_profile is needed to export variables for x server to work properly)
 %* is expanded to windows style filenames with \ instead of /
 I tried to work around this by passing these arguments to bash script:
 Emacs.bat:  wsl bash -c ". ~/.bash_profile && ~/.emacs.d/windows-open %*"  windows-open: ```
 !/bin/sh
 echo "$@" | tr '\' '/' # see how it expands
 emacs $(echo "$@" | tr '\' '/')
  and trying to run:  PS C:\Users\wisni> .\bin\Emacs.bat "te\st lmao"
 C:\Users\wisni>wsl bash -c ". ~/.bash_profile && ~/.emacs.d/windows-open "te\st lmao"" test ``` as you can see only the first word of was passed to the script (te\st) and \s was somehow escaped by the shell to just s.
 I had tried to use single quote instead of double quotes:  wsl bash -c '. ~/.bash_profile && ~/.emacs.d/windows-open %*'  but it breaks even more badly: ``` PS C:\Users\wisni> .\bin\Emacs.bat "te\st lmao"
 C:\Users\wisni>wsl bash -c '. ~/.bash_profile && ~/.emacs.d/windows-open "te\st lmao"' /bin/bash: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching '' /bin/bash: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file `` any idea how to do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm starting at a new large company shortly and I'll need to justify why I want Emacs on my computer.
 For context:
  
the new firm is a Microsoft shop - to the extent that "cloud" == "Azure" (only) and GNU Linux or Apple is not even a dream at the moment
 I'm going to be one of the grown-ups in the room, running a team of technical people, but not coders, I guess the closest concept is technology consulting (if any of my team has ever heard of Emacs I'll be surprised!)
 as a grown-up I'll not be writing much (any) code, and I'm guessing coders get VSCode, because, well, MS
 I code, so elisp will be invaluable to me to build all those little tools to actually GSD
 I'm not a windows person, so I don't have any starting points for windows-specific examples
  
So when I go in and say to tech that I want to install this currently non-approved "text editor", I want to be able to say that Emacs is so much more than an editor, but using an example that translates to a Windows tech support person.
 I thought of something like "Windows isn't just a way of displaying windows, it's an operating system" - but I'm not sure that suggesting I'm installing a whole new operating system is a good look on day one...
 Does anyone have a good way of describing (concisely) Emacs in an analogy?
 I've seen this link, but it seemed to get into arguments around web browsers and JS and answers that were for a full on discussion, rather than a quick justification like I need. Did I miss any other discussions that I should have seen before posting?

 I saw this approach many times in other Haskell projects so I’d like to know whether this is the correct approach when using map/filter/foldl. 
 ```haskell -- approach 1 -- does work, but why? append :: String -> [String] append = map (++"!") . words
 -- approach 2 -- does work -- append :: String -> [String] -- append line = map (++"!") (words line)
 -- approach 3 -- does not work -- append :: String -> [String] -- append line = map (++"!") . (words line)
 main :: IO() main = do print $ append $ "Hello World" ```
 The output is:  [“Hello!”, “World!”]

 Is there something like this for emacs? I'm on windows and have tried 'elgrep' but it just doesn't seem near as efficient as what I was using before because I have to set the directory, reg exp for files, reg exp to ignore files, etc etc... 
 Maybe there is some way to create a command to do this for me or a better/easier to use plugin out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE: You can see the quote below, but looks like google got rid of apps that sign in with "only username and password." So, wtf aside, what's the technique then? (looks like they didn't break legacy so this will only affect new setups). Thanks again.
 ​
 To eliminate possibilities and simplify I'm just sending my password in Pass "" in the .mbsyncrc. Everything installed via homebrew on mac. (following the System Crafters youtube setup instructions). The first error was:
 ---------
 ...
 Connection is now encrypted
 Logging in...
 Authenticating with SASL mechanism PLAIN-CLIENTTOKEN...
 Error performing SASL authentication step: SASL(-7): invalid parameter supplied: Parameter Error in /System/Volumes/Data/SWE/macOS/BuildRoots/d7e177bcf5/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/passwordserver_saslplugins/passwordserver_saslplugins-194/plain_clienttoken.c near line 195
 C: 1/1 B: 0/0 F: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0 N: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0
 ------------
 From (https://macowners.club/posts/email-emacs-mu4e-macos/) I added AuthMechs PLAIN to the .mbsynrc file (also tried adding SSLVersions and SystemCertificates no). After that the error is just:
 Connection is now encrypted
 Logging in...
 Authenticating with SASL mechanism PLAIN...
 IMAP command 'AUTHENTICATE PLAIN <authdata>' returned an error: NO [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Invalid credentials (Failure)
 C: 1/1 B: 0/0 F: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0 N: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0
 ------_
 But the password is verified correct so I'm very confused to be stuck so early. Thank for any light you can shed on this (or if maybe there is a better place to post this... its all about getting email into emacs). I also used the info in the mac link above to export my certificates for a root certificate, don't know if that would be related since I never quite groked certs.
 ​
 Thanks.

 I've been using emacs org-mode to organize my life and take personal notes for about 8 months now. It has taken over my life in the best possible way, and I'm currently trying to find a way to have it replace LibreOffice as my word processor. Does anyone have example configs or recommended packages for this?

 My two main requirements are checking for spelling and grammatical errors (checking grammar is particularly important), and the ability to make/edit rtf files so that my non-tech savy colleagues can open the files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering starting a London Haskell meetup, or reviving it if it used to happen but lost ownership.
 I've not been able to find anything active on meetup.com - but I also guess an FP meetup would be perfectly fine too (just also couldn't find many in London).
 In-person is important to me - I am as cautious as the next person - but I'd like to bootstrap something so that when everyone's comfortable in a room again, it gets healthier as a community.
 I've got maybe 5 years writing HS, more or less as my primary off-the-clock language, so I'm not the most qualified technologist here, but can definitely speak to some of my specifics (quirks with getting performant WASM from Asterius, fun quarantine games built on IHP, music gen, etc).
 I've never dabbled in meetups and I'm really missing a sense of community even though I work in tech (FAANG).
 So - please, any wisdom, all appreciated!
 (if I missed an already active one then job done - please just show me it :) )

 ispell-init-process: Error: The file "/nix/store/96n79c5sfssmn24rpfy7gvsfxcw959k2-aspell-0.60.8/lib/aspell/german" can not be opened for reading.
  
I've set ispell-aspell-dict-dir (and also tried setting ispell-aspell-data-dir) to /run/current-system/sw/lib/aspell, where german.alias and other dictionary files like de.dat can be found. Unfortunately this does not have any effect, ispell.el still tries to open the dictionary via the /nix/store directory of the aspell package (not aspellDicts.de package!) like in the messages above.
 Does anyone have any idea how to fix that?

 I specially am curious on if there are ways to reuse some code and have less repetition, or to use some more advanced features, although I must say Haskell has helped to make developing this project and refactoring a pleasure! 
 The project is meant to replace sites like CifraClub or UltimateGuitar eventually, in a community driven manner. Help me realize the dream :) I plan to create some Docker image to more easily deploy, but I am open to all ideas and suggestions.
 I also learnt quite a lot about MongoDB but it's my first time using, so it might be noticeable.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just seen the post related to the new release of Fourmolu and thought I have a look into it. 
 Unfortunately, it doesn't fit my style. However it reminded me that formatters existed (so far, I've been formatting everything manually for years) and it might be time to finally adopt one. I started investigating and the result is, they are plenty (too many ?), some which might be deprecated and none of them correspond to my style (I think).
 I mean I think because most of them are configurable and it may be possible that one with the correct configuration will fit. So my question is ; is there any formatter which will fit the following requirements (or the closest, I am even ready to modify it if needed).
 I'm pretty much only require list be aligned on (leading comma), but I don't want the formatter to add new line for me after an =. so
 myList = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] 
 (my prefered way) or 
  myList = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] 
 If I have myself started [ 1 on the new line.
 function call like this (when too long)
 function arg1 ( other_function x y ) arg3 
 I do record like this (or equivalent)
 MyRecord = MyRecord { x :: Float , y :: Float } 
 But the most peculiar thing I do is have a trailing let, ie
 my function a = let x = a+1 y = a+10 in x*y 
 and I can't find any formatter allowing it. I'm surprised nobody is doing it because it works really well. It's compact : save one line and one level of indentation and neat to read.
 The rest, I don't really care , I don't need import to be sorted or case to be aligned etc . In fact I just need the level of indentation to be correct : children of things (list element, argument, etc eee) all with the same identation, but first children inline with the parent.

 So I’ve been using Doom now for 1.5 year. 
 I use emacs daily for notes in org-mode, magit, dired and occasional Python programming, but without lsp support as I can’t get it working inside a dev container. 
 All of my “customizations” are just modules I enabled with corresponding flags in doom. 
 I really like the doom experience but I can’t help to feel somewhat stuck as whenever I get some lisp error or want to change something I’m just lost and have no clue what to do. 
 In all other areas of programming I would never accept this, but I just find it so difficult to reach the “next” level and don’t exactly know how. 
 I’ve considered trying a Vanilla eMacs experience for the sake of learning, but then all my productivity would be lost. 
 What was the best thing you did in order to advance to an intermediate level as a beginner?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 i haven't used Org / org-contacts for managing my contacts for years, and with so many other commitments on my plate, i no longer have the resources or interest to continue trying to maintain org-vcard, and deal with the data produced by the software of tech multinationals.
 org-vcard was my first Emacs package - i created it in 2014, even though i'd been using Emacs for decades by that point - and unfortunately, it shows. In recent times i've been trying to do some code cleanup, but to say that there are 'infelicities' - both within the code itself, and in terms of the UX - is an understatement.
 At one point i started doing some work to move to a parser based on the grammars defined in the three vCard specs (2.1, 3.0, 4.0, with differences between them significant enough to make trying to deal with them Less Than Fun), but that didn't get particularly far.
 i'd also toyed with creating an ELisp CardDAV library and refactoring org-vcard to make use of that, but that never eventuated either. (Partly, if i recall correctly, because when i first looked into doing this, there was a bug in Emacs' XML parsing; it got fixed, but the fix took a while to appear in an Emacs release.)
 If anyone is interested in taking maintainership, please contact me (Alexis) at the email address listed in the project repo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just noticed that I forgot to make an announcement for Fourmolu 0.8. If you haven't been keeping up, lots of exciting new features in both Fourmolu 0.8 and 0.9:
  
Fourmolu 0.8 
 Added initial support for leading arrows
 Added new multi-line-compact option for people wanting to use {-| instead of {- |
 
 Fourmolu 0.9 
 Added support for putting let definitions on the next line instead of inline with new let-style option (and configuring whether the in keyword is left-aligned or right-aligned to the let keyword with the in-style option)
 Added support for outputting with unicode characters
 Leaves the where keyword in the module header where the user originally put it
 
  
As always, thanks so much for everyone who contributed. Really awesome work happening over here.

 Thanks so much for any help. It’s always the onion of learning issues when coming back to it.
 UPDATE: I did an install with —cask so I could try running it outside the terminal. And that FIXED it. So it is indeed something with the term as some suggested, but the meta checkbox didn’t fix it.

 M-w does not work. M-x works, which would seem to indicate that the problem is not that windows is prioritizing the meta key for other operations outside of emacs.
 When I run describe-key, it doesn't register anything as happening when I press M-w.
 When I use M-x to find the kill-ring-save command, it shows M-w as being the assigned shortcut. And yet, nothing happens when I type M-w.

I've checked my config options, and I have ALL of the optional server capabilities turn ON and I've got `Company Clang Insert Arguments` set to `on'. I'm not sure what else to check. (Emacs 28.0.92 on Windows). 
 Second, is there a way to turn on completions for the class I'm working on without typing `this->` first? If I want a member variable and I don't remember the name, there doesn't SEEM to be something that lets me implicitly ask for just the class variables and functions. If I start a company completion, it gives me a much broader list of completions, which can be very handy, but usually the list is too big and generic.

  data Entity (t :: EntityClass) where Entity :: EntityID -> SiteID -> EntityConfiguration t -> Entity t 
 I also have a Some type to hide the parameter:
  data Some (t :: k -> Type) where Some :: t k -> Some t 
 I can also hide the parameter using a forall:
  data EntityX where EntityX :: forall t. EntityID -> SiteID -> EntityConfiguration t -> EntityX 
 I have a function that wants to be able to generally use these parametrised classes (e.g. when getting them from a database):
  type Z = Some Entity -- OR type Z = EntityX instantiateFromRow :: (Int32, Int32, Value) -> Either InvalidEntityError Z 
 I'm encountering an issue when writing tests for instantiateFromRow (although I'm sure I'll encounter it elsewhere as well) in that I need to somehow verify that the result of this function is what I think it is (I'm using Hspec, for reference):
  instantiateFromRow (...) `shouldBe` expectedResult 
 The problem is that if I use Some Entity as the result type, then I have the problem that I need Eq instances for Some Entity, which I just cannot work out how to get right (I get lots of "cannot match type t1 with t2"), but if I use EntityX then I have problems with the forall t not matching the output of functions which do things like parse JSON instance FromJSON (Some EntityConfiguration).
 So I either need to find a nice way to:
  
extract the inner value from the Some existential (but this feels fraught with type difficulty in its own right);
 deriving / write Eq instances for Some Entity
 find a way to reconcile these type variables (which feels like a problem for which one needs dependent types at which point I'm both lost and screwed since Haskell doesn't really support them AFAICT).

 M-x describe-variable says:
 tab-width is a variable defined in ‘C source code’. Its value is 2 Original value was 8 Local in buffer summary-fields.json; global value is 4 
 exactly as expected, but hitting tab, or even comma :-/ consistently aligns me with 4 space tabs, which is getting me down.

 Org mode is perhaps the first thing that comes to mind as a way to have this in emacs. However, org mode isn't directly extensible by the user. At least, I'm not aware of any API to define e.g. a new kind of plain list, with associated operations.
 Are there other packages that allow defining ad hoc user widgets in the same style? Recognizing patterns in bits of text, extracting info from them, and providing actions for interacting with them. This could very pair nicely with org.

 I understand that project.el is "new" and follows the approach when there is a .git folder and other heuristics to auto-determine what a constitutes a project. EDE is "old" and has a declarative approach.
 Yet EDE is prominently documented and has imenu-entries, suggesting newcomers to click and try.
 Is EDE using project.el under the hood? And if not: Wouldn't project.el warrant menu entries?

 This works great for buffers, but I wish there was an equivalent behavior of `n`/`N`, but for entire projects. I know you can use projectile to find and replace regexps, but I like the flexibility and ease of use of the `n`/`N` + macros flow.

 I am wondering whether there is a recommended workflow for using org-roam to read source code managed by git?
 What I am imagining is that:
  
When I open a source code file/buffer, the notes I've taken before would show highlight in the buffer.
 I can read the notes I've taken, and travel from notes to source, under org-roam
 's help.
 The notes can record the git commit hash of the selected text if any. If I want to travel from notes to source like in 2.
 , it will show the historical file content when the notes were taken, if the file has changed.

 Do you have any battle-tested method ? I did not find any article about that.

open-games-hs is a Haskell library and DSL for defining,
operating, and analyzing certain kinds of game-theoretic games. It comes
with a rich type theory and implementation that allows for the
specification of agent strategies as Haskell functions.
For some games, encoding strategies in Haskell is fairly simple. But one could

But I wanted to see if there was anything I'd be missing before I do that. The only things I can think of are
  
Aesthetics while editing - yes you can export with org in a pretty format of your choosing, but it seems like you don't have quite as much control over aesthetics while writing. I don't really care too much about this, just something I've noted
 Line wrapping in table fields - in Notion I make heavy use 2 column tables that have tens of rows, and line wrapping works seamlessly. It seems like org tables don't really support line wrapping. I read about a few possible solutions but they seem a bit like they are going against the grain. This is probably the biggest holdup that might stop me from transitioning
  
Is there anything else I'm missing? I don't care much about #1, but I'd also love to hear solutions to #2 if anyone has any.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering how I can use emacs lisp to change the way text appears in the buffer (without actually modifying the underlying text). Essentially I want to include a "label" of sorts. 
 Specifically, I create presentations using RMarkdown and xaringan (which use remark.js on the backend) in Emacs. Three dashed lines (e.g., "---") marks the beginning of a new slide. At every occurrence of these three dashed lines, I want to display the slide number. So the buffer will look like this:
 ```
  
Header for first slide
 content
  
Header for second slide
  
Header for third slide
 ```
 And what I want the the buffer to look like this:
 ```
 --- Slide 1
 Header for first slide
 content
 --- Slide 2
 Header for second slide
 --- Slide 3
 Header for third slide
 ```
 So after I type "---" with a line break, it will add the slide number. The trick is that I can't actually insert the text though because in order for xaringan to properly break slides, there cannot be anything after the three dashes, not even a line break.
 How can I do this? If I am in a git project, I can see that magit includes the "+" character at the end of the line without actually modifying the plain text, so this has to be doable, right?

 Tl;dr: there seem to be some new email setups that seems cool (mu4e, notmuch, etc), and online videos for setup. But I don’t see anyone sorting/filtering email on arrive… more search the giant db ala gmail. Surely I’m just missing something?

There are lisp machine implementations for fpgas, so I was wondering (not for performance reasons but just as a hobbyist project or out of curiosity), if there are elisp machine implementations for fpgas. I.e. we replace the interpreter with an actual machine and use the elisp code as our kernel/os.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand the first part of the second line -- which osascript > /dev/null 2>&1 && -- in the following script, from this Tips And Tricks page, to start emacsclient on MacOS:
 #!/bin/sh which osascript > /dev/null 2>&1 && osascript -e 'tell application "Emacs" to activate' emacsclient -c "$@" 
 .My (very meagre) understanding is that the script does the following three things:
  
Check that osascript is present
 Launch Emacs (which I guess it is assumed should have a call to (server-start) in its init.el or .emacs), but only if osascript is present,
 Run emacsclient
  
Is that right? If so, I have two questions:
  
Exactly how does the "but only if" in my point #2 above work? I assume that if the which osascript fails, then the call to osascript -e never happens. But how is that done? Something to do with the && I presume?
 Why is the script author making only the call to oasscript -e conditional on a successful which osascript? Why don't they also gate the emacsclient line itself? (In other words why don't just they kill the whole script if the which fails?) I might have understood letting the emacsclient line still run, even if the which had failed, but only if the author had included a -a option for emacsclient. Then, even if the failed which did blocked the call to oascript -e which in turn meant there would be no Emacs launched (and so no call to start-server), still emacsclient could have launched the alternate editor it had been given using -a. But as it stands, it looks like emacsclient will still valiantly attempt to launch even though it is almost certainly doomed to failure through lack of an emacs server.

 So my question is - if I use flycheck, am I gimping myself? Does eglot also seamlessly work with flycheck, ivy, etc. because they all secretly use the same data sources or something?
 It's also got me thinking, is flycheck way better than flymake? I kind of cargo culted my current set of packages.

 I run Windows Emacs and do most of my work there.
 On some occasions I need to run Cygwin and do some stuff there.
 What I'd like to do when in Cygwin is to edit a file in my running Windows Emacs.
 I tried calling emacsclientw.exe from the Cygwin shell and pass a Windows file path but I always end up with a new instance of Emacs.
 Is that something that I can get to work?

If I'm using company-files for file name completion but I already had a file name written down, the completion simply inserts the new file name, instead of replacing the old one:
  
"./some-folder/_some-file.txt" 
 "./some-folder/my-file.txtsome-file.txt" 
  
It would be nice if company was smart enough to remove the trailing file name. Is there a simple solution here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never quite figured out how to search for Info nodes reliably in Emacs. I understand that Emacs is self-documenting and that the Info system is very comprehensive, so I always try to use Emacs and Info to search for answers before resorting to a web search. However I sometimes find it quite difficult to find what I need which makes me feel like I'm missing something.
 I was reading the Emacs development mailing list this morning and came across messages about "EUDC", but I didn't know what that was. So I hit C-h i to run info.
 I first tried m to select a manual, but EUDC did not appear in this list. I assumed that it would be part of the Emacs manual, so I tried to select "Emacs" from this list but that too did not appear. I closed info and instead hit C-h r to run info-emacs-manual and I then searched through the list from m for EUDC but found nothing. I then tried i (Info-index) but again EUDC did not appear in the list.
 I then tried a (info-apropos) but again nothing was found for "EUDC". Finally I got somewhere with s (Info-search); this took me to a page "33.4.2 Mail Header Editing" which had a comment about EUDC at the very bottom. There finally I saw the text "see EUDC (eudc)" which was a link to the correct "Emacs Unified Directory Client" info page.
 As you can see, my method for finding the correct Info manual was far from optimal. My question therefore is, what is the correct way of finding manuals like this using Info in Emacs?

 This morning, like most mornings, I once more began the process, like many of y'all I imagine, of struggling, tussling, and generally wrestling with Org mode, in the quaint belief that one day soon I will finally bring the brute -- and my organizational life -- under control, and that way find joy, harmony, eudaimonia, and maybe even release from Samsara. On that day -- O Frabjous Day! -- I will have won the battle over chaos and the tyranny of umpteen calendar events, a thousand post-it notes, ten thousand notebook jottings, and an uncountable number of ideas that spin around my poor brain. On that day -- Callooh! Callay! -- I will be at peace, and my ToDo list will finally respect me.
 And then I noticed this:

 Forget Skynet; forget LaMDA; and forget Ava, that hot robot chick in Ex Machina. If anything is sentient, it's Org mode and resistance is useless. Valar Org-hulis. 😩

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I just installed Scala today for the first time, and thought I'd give it a whirl. My Scala version is 3.2.1, which should handle even JDK 19. However, during cs setup, cs installed JDK version 8u292. It might not be a big deal, but when I start off with a clean slate, I like to run the newest of the new to be able to take full advantage of the latest features, should I feel like it.
 What's the "correct" way of changing the JVM version used by Scala, so I can use the latest version? Do I manually download and install the JDK of choice? Can one of the CLI tools do it for me, like NVM (Node Version Manager) for node?
 Thank you for your time!
 Edit: Understandably, when I didn't specify it, it's easy to assume I'm on linux, but I'm on Windows 11! Sorry for not including that in the original post, but I don't really think it matters regardless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Expand region may be my most used thing in emacs yet it's a bit frustrating out of the box. I know there's ways to 'advice' the command to expand in certain ways, there's 2 specific things I want:
 On assignments/expressions
 I'd like expansion to always select the expression first but it seems to work backwards e.g. with this region
 a = b[c] ^ 
 expanding again leads to this
 a = b[c] ^^^^^ 
 instead of
 a = b[c] ^^^^ 
 On vterm/truncated lines Assume that the screen ends at col 5 with this
 barbaz foobar\ qux 
 If the region is currently foobar but the actual full string is foobarqux, expand region will go back and select all the way to the top of the buffer instead of the remaining part qux.
 TL;DR How can I bias expand-region to select forward instead of backward? Also to stop on newlines and not default to the entire buffer when it doesn't seem to know where else to go?

 Sometimes if the ctrlf minibuffer loses focus for some reason (does not just happen when I use my mouse), it will remain open and I cannot use C-s or C-r again until I manually click on the minibuffer to focus it.
 I would have expected C-s/C-r to focus an existing ctrlf minibuffer if it existed, but they do not, and I could not come up with a good way to implement this myself.
 Is there a good workaround for this? Alternatives to ctrlf?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a question as described in the title. I'm working a lot with Kubernetes and because of the nature of it - a lot of YAML files.
 These files usually end being a YAML file with Go or helm templates, which totally breaks parsing of said file for with Flycheck. I do appreciate all the YAML structure hints and usual errors which Flycheck would catch - but I can't figure out a way how to stop whole buffer from highlighting if YAML file contains some go template logic - or similar. I'd say the same would be true if i.e. the file would be an ERB template of said YAML.
 For context, I'm using doom-emacs, although not sure if that matters, I'd be happy to configure this even manually if needed.

The cryptonite library is considered state of the art for cryptography within the Haskell ecosystem. However, the library’s maintenance should be strengthened and its test coverage expanded, given that it is a language standard. If the project is still developed in Haskell, consider investing in or contributing to the library and performing a security audit on it.
  
SimpleX Chat v4.2 is released with group links and many other things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently fully committed to an efficiency oriented programming workflow/setup, switching to arch linux with a standalone WM and learning VIM movements and during this new era of my developer timeline I found out about Emacs and then Doom Emacs, I almost immediately went to Doom Emacs after spending only about 2 days in GNU/Emacs as I had heard about all the cool features such as evil mode and alot of speed improvements and I have so long really enjoyed using it and I am constantly updating my configuration for doom.
 However, when searching the web for help in configuring Doom Emacs because I want to use it as my main IDE and get rid of Intellij and VScode and in my search of doing so I realized that there was very little content on Doom emacs in comparison to GNU Emacs, my initial thought was that obviously GNU emacs has been around for 40 something years while doom is relatively new it makes sense, however I noticed that even recent videos from these couple of years still mostly feature GNU emacs.
 Is there some kind of advantage to using GNU emacs over more custom versions such as Doom? Maybe more customization, better performance? Or is there maybe some kind of inherent disadvantage to Doom?
 Also if anyone has any good resources on how to configure doom extensively please share them it would be appreciated :) 
 Edit: Thank you all for your feedback and clarifications, while reading through some emacs documentation I came along Chemacs and I will take the advice to watch the emacs from scratch series whilst being able to have my regular doom emacs setup on the side while working on my base emacs setup.

 I like the default fringe style "doom" provides, they show both flycheck and git-gutter. I just want to increase the width.
 Previously, I tried git-gutter-fringe but it overrides the flycheck fringe. I checked vc-gutter file, I have not got is it using git-gutter or git-gutter-fringe.

 Sorry for the noobie question but, is there an official documentation of eglot? 
 I am using it for my python programming projects but there are a few things that I don't know how to configure them. This is a small list:
  
Setting the python console directory and the PYTHONPATH variable for each project
 Finding inside the project where a class is defined
 After executing a script with C-c C-c go to the point where it raises an exception
  
Thank you for your help.

 I added the "Haskell" extension (the Haskell LSP actually) to VSCode and I set the correct settings on my remote machine.
 The problem is when I try to use it on a new project, the HLS server tries to start 5 times but fails without any error.
 So after 5 attempts it just says it cannot start.
 Here are the last chunk of logs HLS sends to VSCode (4 identical chunks are sent before, I just put one for sake of economy of space):

This often leaves the reader with the impression that they have to unlearn practices and concepts they already know to adopt this new paradigm.
In this post I would like to try a different approach, not requiring any programming knowledge, but only the most basic intuition. We will build on high school mathematics, in the form of sets and functions, to provide a learning path to understanding functional programming1.

I want to run an async process and have both stdout and stderr display to the same buffer (as if it was run in a terminal), but I want to just store stdout to a variable/pass to a lambda for use in code. I don't see an obvious way to do this from the docs. 
 The two options I see are: 
  
I call make-process without the :stderr option, and both stdout/stderr end up in the same buffer, but a process filter can't discern between them. 
 I call make-process with :stderr, and I have to provide a separate buffer for stderr
  
What I want is the combined output to show in a buffer for informational purposes, but code parses and uses stdout. This is because the commands I'm running are long running and display progress in stderr. Am I missing some obvious way to do this?

 and the file factorial?
 and how do I link them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My questions:
  
why doesn't to global mode activate globally?
 
how do I get it to do that for all non-special buffers?
 
 emacs version: GNU Emacs 29.0.50
 I mostly use emacs-client.
 This doesn't happen when I run emacs by itself or in a terminal emacs -nw
 I'm not doing anything to check if the daemon is running in my config.
 Basically everything runs the same code. 
  
Since version 27 emacs has a built-in display-fill-column-indicator-mode and a global version too. 
 Early in my init files, I create a text-mode buffer named *text* (naming is hard). 
 Later on I use (global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode 1) and when I open a new (non special) buffer sure enough there's a fill column indicator over at the right hand side. Same when I visit elisp files, python files, .. pretty much everything. 
 However in my generated *text* buffer and the *scratch* buffer there is no indicator. 
 When I run emacs -nw or plain emacs works as expected and both those buffers have the indicator. 
 With emacs-client though, in those buffers, the global-minor-modes does include global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode but local-minor-modes does not include display-fill-column-indicator-mode. 
 In contrast I also have 
 (use-package display-line-numbers :ensure nil :hook ((text-mode-hook . display-line-numbers-mode) (prog-mode-hook . display-line-numbers-mode))) 
 And indeed display-line-numbers-mode is active in both the *scratch* buffer and my own *text* despite not setting those hooks until after the *text* buffer even using emacs-client. 
 How can I get this behaviour in all buffers?

 I planned this as an addition to Cognitive Loads in Programming but it is written as an independent topic. My goal in this post has been to examine in-depth deductive and empirical as 2 distinct mindsets programmers have when coding and communicating. 
 I am posting it here as (1) a followup to Cognitive Loads in Programming, (2) because IMO it is relevant to the discourse about FP and Haskell in particular. 
 I hope you find it interesting.
