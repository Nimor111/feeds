        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I apologize for the possibly annoying question, but I'm struggling to get Emacs 28's nativecomp to work. There are plenty of guides/posts online about installing libgccjit with Homebrew to get it to work.
 But, I've been using MacPorts for a long time and really don't have any desire to use both MacPorts and Homebrew.
 When I install any of the usual suspect Emacs packages in MacPorts (emacs-app, emacs-mac-app, etc), I get the same issue when Emacs starts up: it floods the *Warnings* buffer with stuff like:
  
Warning (comp): collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status Disable showing Disable logging
 Warning (comp): libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver Disable showing Disable logging
 Warning (comp): /Applications/MacPorts/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/outline.el.gz: Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Disable showing Disable logging
  
Now, this is totally normal when GCC and/or libgccjit are not present, and a web search of these errors will find several forums posts and bug reports, etc. The Homebrew crowd just installs some specific GCC package and all is well for them.
 I pretty quickly realized that macOS's clang is aliased (or soft-linked, or something- I didn't investigate) to gcc. So, I suspected that I needed to install the real GCC from MacPorts. Since my $PATH has my ports directory prepended, running gcc from a shell does in fact call the correct, true, GCC.
 However, I suspect that Emacs still doesn't see the correct GCC when it starts up. If you're familiar with macOS and Emacs, you might know what I'm talking about when I say that I do use the exec-path-from-shell Emacs package, but I assume that it does its thing too late in the start-up process to help me.
 Does anyone know a straight-forward way to either change the GCC path(s) for Emacs early enough to matter, or just some other way to get nativecomp working with only using stuff from MacPorts?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 On the heels of last week thread about evil mode, I wanted to ask if there's a good guide to getting started with evil?
 I've been using Emacs with evil mode for a couple of years, but there's always something that seems to be breaking or misbehaving.
 The latest thing that was bugging me was undo-tree wasn't properly integrated with evil, so sometimes it just wouldn't work - even after I spent time looking into it.
 I dont need evil in minibuffer, but some commands are just too ingrained now (dd, G, / and so forth) that switching evil mode off is just as painful as keeping it on and living with issues.
 Is there a robust way to get evil mode going? A guide? Much as I love modal editing my only other option is to embrace emacs way and disable evil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Normally in Haskell code you can just put:
 module <module name> where 
 at the top of one file, and then use any code from that file in a second file by including:
 import <module name> 
 at the head of your second file. However, I'm not sure how to do this for happy files, since the code defining the parser in happy is technically not Haskell... I think... happy files end in a '.y', not a '.hs', and they have different syntax, for the most part. So, does anyone know how to break up a large happy parser into multiple modules/files?
 Edit: Specifically, its the grammar section that I want to break into multiple files

Lately I've been documenting some SQL we've been using for a project, which happily opens in a separate buffer to edit, and works great. However when I save the buffer (C-c ' ) and return to the main document buffer my keyboard direction appears reversed. So far I've been unsuccessful in determining a setting or switch that might be triggered to cause this, and the only way I've had to reverse the input flow is to close and re-open emacs. What am I missing here?

In my case, performing one or multiple searches will turn up all of the Zettels. Also, in some cases, the Zettels' unique identifiers are listed in a different Zettel. Perhaps there's a way to remove the Zettels given a list of unique identifiers. And in fact, there is. That's the solution that user Raffa over at Askubuntu proposed: https://askubuntu.com/a/1401828/1555551
I didn't consider Obsidian, my Zettelkasten software, because there's no feature to help with this and I don't trust third-party plugins.

 fmap length :: (Functor f, Foldable t) => f (t a) -> f Int
 and Just :: a -> Maybe a

 Can I combine this with markdown fenced code block in a way that

 The same question applies in principle to org-mode too, where such a functionality would be fantastic too.

 trait Nat class Zero extends Nat class Succ[A <: Nat] extends Nat trait <=[A <: Nat, B <: Nat] { ... } 
 I'd like to define trait <[A <: Nat, B <: Nat] in terms of <=, noting that <[A, B] if and only if <=[A, Succ[B]]. I tried writing,
 object < { def apply[A <: Nat, B <: Nat](implicit lt: <=[A, Succ[B]]): <[A, B] = lt } 
 but this does not typecheck. It seems to me that I need some sort of casting to turn an instance of < into <=, which should be possible.
 How would one go about doing this?

 those marked messages are not on the same page, so I need to scroll the buffer to see them,
 so is there any way how to kill (suppress) the unmarked messages, so there are not displayed (but off course, they will not be deleted)?
  
I've read the manual, but I can't find thre relevant answer.

 I wrote a comment on the post that I thought might actually be better here: 
 When learning functional programming, the day you learn what a catamorphism is, is an enlightening day. There's a lot of boilerplate here for what is essentially the definition of a sum type, and a function which takes one argument corresponding to each constructor. In Haskell, the first few catamorphisms people are generally introduced to are:

For anyone who speaks German: Would you mind translating any of these cards from German to English?
Here's a list of some cards to choose from:
https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_BG2a_3347_R

https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_BG2a_3346_R
You're welcome to choose whichever one(s) are easiest. His handwriting seems a bit difficult to parse on them.
It would be great to see the nature of Luhmann's individual bibnotes in English.
I can, of course, hire a translator myself. However, I wanted to ask the Zettelkasten community here first in case there are any good samaritans that can help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3 days ago I accidentally discovered Zettelkasten! I was half watching a video on YouTube, and when it finished, a new video automatically played, which talked about a system called Zettelkasten. As it was explained, I realised this was exactly what I had been looking for, for years. Over the last few years I have read hundreds of books and listened to thousands of podcast episodes and diligently made notes on much of that content and then placed it in Evernote never to be seen again!
I'm still deciding on what tools to use to create my own Zettelkasten, and the Evernote tomb could be revived and used as a kind of fleeting notes folder, and then slowly go through the 12,000+ notes in there and transition them into literature/permanent notes, to convert that information into useable knowledge.
Since discovering that video, I have listened to an audiobook version of "How to take smart notes", watched several videos from Bryan Jenks, Martin Adams and others, in order to have a really good understanding of how to go about setting up my first zettelkasten.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I am trying to wrap my head around completions in emacs. To begin, I am not sure what the definition of 'completion' in the context of emacs is, so I am using the term quite vaguely. It is unfortunate, but is perhaps a good indication of where my emacs knowledge stands right now. 
 I have figured out that packages like selectrum and vertico shape how minibuffer suggestions appear on the screen. From the vertico page, I then moved on to consult. My current understanding is that packages like ivy/helm/consult provide enhancements to emacs commands (and perhaps also introduce some new commands) for buffer selection, register selection etc., including algorithms and interfaces for showing sensible possible options for the minibuffer prompt. 
 However, where I totally get lost is company. What does company do? I am experimenting with lsp-mode, and it suggests using company. Does company also do the same thing as consult? 
 Any comments and suggestions like links to pages which explain this ecosystem would be awesome.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So as an example of what I mean: say I have an optics modeling program in which you can have a material with a refractive index and thickness, as well as functions with that material
 type RI = Double type Thickness = Double data Material = Material RI Thickness reflection :: Material -> Double -> .... reflection material wavelength = ...... glass = Material 1.5 100 water = Material 1.3 200 
 But I could also just build a function that directly take the refractive index and thickness as arguments, and use the curried values to represent the materials
 reflection :: RI -> Thickness -> Double -> .... reflection ri thickness wavelength = .... glass = reflection 1.5 100 water = reflection 1.3 200 
 Are the disadvantages to using currying as a way to store values in this way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I guess this is your once in a while odd thread. :) 
 I’ll start from the get go. I have always been rather fascinated with keyboard and cli only life. Just breeze through everything with commands burned into muscle memory. Feel like the computer is an extension of your brain.
 Fate made me a lawyer. I don’t write code and nothing even close. here’s what I do with my mac:
  
I read documents, laws, verdicts and the occasional city plan pdf file (Am a real-estate lawyer). 
 Write legal documents and opinions for clients
 Read and write many emails in several languages (right-to-left and left-to-right languages). Around 30% of my regular work day is dedicated to emails really. Extremely vital
 Manage personal calendar appointments via outlook (clients go through my secretaries)
 Manage personal To-do lists
 Listen to music, mostly through spotify or youtube 
 Browse interesting subreddits here and there
 listen to podcasts and audio books.
  
That basically summarizes it. 
 Now I’ve actually read and watched a fair share of information regarding EMACS. The ORG intrigues me quite a bit. But I don’t really know if i’m barking up the wrong tree.
 Do you think something like EMACS, as a window manager (on arch probably, which I installed before and liked the Pacman a lot) can replace all these different softwares (from outlook, preview, spotify [which i know has a cli version!], MS word, MS excel, safari) and act as a seamless “one-stop-shop”?
 Or am I better just sticking out to my iMac and dealing with current workflow. 
 Thanks in advance! I’m very much excited reading your answers! Have an awesome day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I have some experience with Java, Kotlin and Scala. My favourite language by far is Scala, mostly because of their support for FP and monads compared to the other two. I just started in a new job where I am able to decide what language to use for our new backend. I would love to use Scala, however, finding the appropriate libraries/frameworks for Scala seems like a hassle. For Java/Kotlin its a no brainer : Spring Boot.
 Because of this, I'm not sure if its worth to go for Scala even. 
 I have been looking at:
 Rest api:
 Play - No support for Scala 3 yet?
 Http4s
 Cask
 Akka http
 DI:
 No library - Cake pattern (or any other way without any library)
 MacWire 
 Datebase access:
 Quill
 Doobie
 Slick
 ScalikeJDBC 
 Trying to find out what we should choose is giving me a headeache. In my earlier job we used
 Akka Http, Cake pattern and ScalikeJDBC, but I don't want to use this stack just because I have experience in it. For example, a quick google search has shown me that the cake pattern really is not a good way to do DI (although I personally didn't have any strong problems with it, although it did became a little bit messy when the code base grew big). It just seems much simpler just to pick Kotlin + Spring boot.
 What do you guys think?

 I am trying to add a new language server for lsp-mode. My current configuration to add it is this:
 ``` (defgroup lsp-gobra nil "LSP group for gobra." :group 'lsp-mode)
 (with-eval-after-load 'lsp-mode (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(gobra-mode . "gobra")))

 I have already defined a major mode called gobra-mode which is enabled when I open a gobra file. This configuration doesn't seem to start the jar file server. Manually starting lsp mode in a gobra-mode buffer doesn't seem to do anything either. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Recently a weird orange marker (like an orange ball) started to show up in the thin grey bar in the left margin next to newly-capture tasks. The orange ball survives a refile to elsewhere, however if I use "Alt-up" to move it in the org hierarchy, the orange ball disappears.
 Any ideas what this is? See screenshot.
 Thanks!

From searching the error online, i get that it has something to do with lsp-java-workspace but how do you set in the .emacs. file? I'm thinking its something like (setq-default lsp-java-workspace) but not exactly sure. Also does it work with any version of java or do i need a specific version?

 So, why not just have an extractor with type >>~ :: Mb->b ?
 Why have bind take in a function, versus just converting types and piping?

 From my experience with to-do apps and ORG-MODE, I've come to learn that I need to protect my daily agenda, or it will simply grow and grow and grow.

 I want all my Emacs keybindings to be consistent and make sense (for me). However, this does not come by default. I want to start from a scratch, so I would like to unbind everything. All Emacs default bindings, and plugin bindings (with the exception of Evil Mode).
 Basically, I want to things:
  
A way to unbind all default bindings.
 A way to prevent a plugin from creating bindings.
  
How can I do this?
 EDIT:
 I tried removing the default bindings with this:
 ```lisp (setq my-global-map (make-keymap))
 (substitute-key-definition 'self-insert-command 'self-insert-command my-global-map global-map)
 (use-global-map my-global-map) ```
 It almost does the job, except that some keys stop working properly, like enter, backspace, and escape.

I see a few problems with my notes:
1) There are too many notes that are not my own ideas, just things I've captured from other places. 
All this to say, I am thinking of starting anew. (I wouldn't actually delete any of my existing notes.) I feel like I have too much of a mess on my hands and want to begin with a blank page.
Has anyone else done this? Been tempted to and decided against it? Why or why not?]]></summary>

 There are no classes in Haskell -- it's not object-oriented.
 As you can clearly see if you search for Haskell programmer positions on job sites, there is definitely no money in Haskell.
 Whenever one encounters Haskell for the first time, they usually ask questions like "but how do you do X without a state" which Haskell programmers are tired of explaining.
 And a lot of people make a point that Haskell is a beautiful language in theory but isn't very good in practice, which drives Haskell programmers up the wall.
 Conclusion: Haskell is communism.

Last Week
Spent time developing programming chops.
Not much success picking up my reading pace in Effective Notetaking.
Created a new blogging workflow.
Started boxing training.
This Week
This week, I'll meet with the New York Times writer Carl Zimmer as part of JAMM328.
I'll be refining a shell script for inserting part of a note's file name as a title as the note's header.
Expanding on and refactoring zettel stemming from my ideas about thinking in built environments.
I will be reading some Rumi poetry that likely will stimulate ideas.
I'm currently reading: Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson and One Long River of Song by Brian Doyle
Trivia.
These are the titles of the last few notes I've created and am excited about. Show me yours! We are interested in seeing what you are up to, even if you have one or two newish zettel to share!

 I'm thinking about taking up FP with Scala, but a friend advised that it's a dying language, and moreover, whatever advantages it may have had have been mostly closed by newer Java/C# that now support FP constructs like immutable data structures/fields, higher order functions, streams/LINQ, pattern matching, lambdas, generics, etc. If you are well-versed in Java or C# and Scala, can you provide code examples based on real problems that demonstrate why Scala would still make a better choice than Java/C# today for new big projects?

 I recently understood a bit about monad transformers, so I wanted to use them in my application. I installed transformers and started in a small section of my code. The following example used to have a lot of pattern matching, and my code would drift toward the right as I added more case statements, so I refactored it using ExceptT.
  getActivityAggregate activityId -> ExceptT.runExceptT $ do activity <- State.gets (Map.lookup activityId) <&> maybe (Left (ActivityNotFound activityId)) Right & ExceptT measurements <- State.gets (Map.findWithDefault [] activityId) <&> Right & ExceptT ActivityAggregate.build activity measurements & ExceptT.except & ExceptT.withExceptT mapError where mapError (ActivityAggregate.NoMeasurements activity) = NoMeasurements activity mapError (ActivityAggregate.MeasurementsFromAnotherActivity activity measurement) = MeasurementsFromAnotherActivity activity measurement 
 I want to bring to your attention that when I have a monad containing an `Either, I wrap it in the ExceptT constructor. Am I doing this correctly? Am I missing some function that already does this? Is there a terser way of writing the same? Thanks

 I then type C-c C-c to run org-babel-execute-src-block, which reports the error "forward-sexp: Wrong type argument: markerp, nil".

 Fwiw, :results output works as intended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Yesterday I upgraded from Emacs 27.1 (Installed via emacs-mac) to Emacs 28.1 (installed via Homebrew).
 Everything seems to work fine so far, except Arabic ligatures are broken: for instance, لا (ل followed by ا) only shows a broken line. با and نا are also affected, and only the first half of the ب and the ن are shown. 
 لا باس
 Another thing I'm noticing is that punctuation behavior got worse: if I type a comma, for instance, it's shown at the far right of the sentence, until I type the next letter, and then the comma is where it should be.
 ​
 Is there anything I can do to fix this?
 ​
 Thank you
 ​
 Edit: attach and fix screenshot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce the first release of the ordset library
 This is an implementation of a math concept of ordered sets and maps on various kinds of domains: bounded/unbounded, continuous/discrete. In essence ordered set or map can be viewed as a collection of intervals equipped with:
  
efficient search method to check whether element belongs to set;
 a suite of well known transformation operators: union, intersection, inversion, zip, map, flatMap, etc.
  
All implementations are thread-safe by design, cause underlying data structures are immutable and persistent (like immutable collections of standard library are).
 But please don't confuse them with standard sorted sets, here are Scastie examples to demonstrate the difference. Also some basic concepts are described in project blog.
 The project is in active development now, i will be very grateful for any feedback or contribution.

However, I've run into the problem described in this post's title. To make sure that I'm understood and to include all potentially important information, I'll elaborate.
I have an outline whose filename is 202204091330 s2 Obsidian.md. It lists links in the same vein as the outline example from your post about the script. This file is in the home folder of my Ubuntu 21.10. The output of zettel_outline --version is zettel_outline 0.1.1 (2016-01-23). Nothing weird appears in the terminal when I run the script:
zettel_outline -f '202204091330 s2 Obsidian.md' -a /home/annabella/Archive/Zettelkasten/ -o draft.md

Everything seems fine at first in the draft. At a closer look, I find the whole content of a Zettel that wasn't linked to, spread 16 times thorough it. Unlike the other Zettels, the <!-- § --> part doesn't include its unique identifier. I checked my Zettelkasten to see if its unique identifier happened to be that of another Zettel, but it wasn't the case. The Zettels from the outline don't link to this Zettel and this Zettel doesn't link to them.
Any idea of what I could be doing wrong? I'll include any information you need on demand.]]></summary>

 This happens when i call (rainbow-blocks-propertize-region (point-min) (point-max)), but as soon as i do anything like type or move the point or scroll, the properties of the first image disappear and the rainbow-blocks takes over the whole buffer, so all the saturated colours disappear, which i dont want. I want it to look like the second image all the time. This doesn't happen when i set jit-lock-mode to nil, but then of course i dont have jit-lock. What should i do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an old version of gnutls on my system, which I cannot uninstall (no sudo permissions). Instead, I installed a local version in my home directory and set PKG_CONFIG_DIR to point to it so that when I call pkg-config -libs gnutls I get the correct paths
  -L/home/user/.local/stow/gnutls/lib -lgnutls 
 I then tried compiling emacs from source by calling ./configure and make but got a linking error.
  ld: gnutls.o: in function `Fgnutls_peer_status': /home/user/emacs/src/gnutls.c:1505: undefined reference to `gnutls_session_etm_status' 
 Upon further inspection, I found that the linking command is something like this
  gcc -o temacs.tmp {CFLAGS} ... gnutls.o ... -L/usr/lib64 -lgtk-3 ... -L/home/user/.local/stow/gnutls/lib -lgnutls ... 
 The problem is that the old gnutls library in /usr/lib64 take precedence over the custom directory that is specified right before linking gnutls. I resolved this by changing the LIBGNUTLS_CFLAGS to include -L /home/user/.local/stow/gnutls/lib so that the this directory takes precedence over all other subsequent directories.
 This feels too hacky. Is there a better way to resolve?

 I would like this :
 This is a long text that have been justify with adaptive word-spacing and without cut inside words ! 
 Not this : 
 This is a long text that have been justify wit hout adaptive word-spacing and with cuts insid e words ! 
 Or this :
 This is a long text that haven't been justify there is just a limitation of the number of char by line with a line wrap. 
 Is it even possible ?

 After writing to the init file it says:
  
By default, lsp-mode's keybindings are available under s-l(Super-l), e. g. s-l h h will show documentation at point. You may change the default prefix by setting lsp-keymap-prefix.
  
and that shortcut does conflict with my system's, so I wanted to make it something else, I've tried adding
 (setq lsp-keymap-prefix (kbd "s-z"))
 before and after the entering of lsp-mode, when added before it gave an error, and when added after s-z remained undefined, my init file doesn't contain anything other than the one mentioned in the link

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing some fun code that does symbolic algebra, and a part of that is also evaluating the expressions after plugging in parameters for the variables. Actually, profiling shows that 50% of runtime is spent in expression evaluation, so I'm keen to optimise this as much as possible.
 ​
 Here's an explicit example. Our expression has a simple data type definition.
 infixl 4 :+: infixl 5 :*: data Expr = Const Double | Var !Int | Exp !Expr | !Expr :*: !Expr | !Expr :+: !Expr deriving (Eq, Generic, NFData) 
 Next, evaluation is done by plugging in a vector of parameters. Specific parameters are chosen by the Int in the Var constructor, which just acts as an index for the vector.
 type ParamState = Vector Double evalWith :: ParamState -> Expr -> Double evalWith params expr = case expr of Const c -> c Var x -> params ! x Exp a -> exp (evalWith params a) a :+: b -> evalWith params a + evalWith params b a :*: b -> evalWith params a * evalWith params b 
 I can now define an equation of 6 variables as an expression, and evaluate with a vector of parameters. If I just write out the equation as a Haskell function, criterion says that it takes 9ns to run. The same equation in my Expr data type takes 70ns.
 This is by no means slow, but if half of my runtime is spent in evalWith, then every nanosecond counts!
 So, any ideas on improvements? Inlining evalWith seems to do nothing, I suppose due to the function being so simple already. Any help or insights would be appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a university assignment, though this question is not about any of its contents but rather about the build system.
 I have a coursework that implies building some sort of Haskell project. My professor wants to build my coursework using ghc (by doing something like ghc Main.hs). The problem with that is the fact that I want to use an external library - that I solved by using Cabal and everything works fine. What doesn't work (and I have no idea how I could achieve something like this) is making my project compile with said library when using ghc. Getting rid of the library or coding its functionality myself is out of the question since it's a complex library and I don't have time to redo it; also, including its whole dependency tree is not viable since it has 10 or so dependencies, and then each dependency has 10 other dependencies and so on.
 How can I make my project compile with the library while using ghc?
 Thanks!

 Yes!
 Even if the URL is displayed like any other links in the buffer (using the face org-link).
 Yes!
 But, if the URL https://orgmode.org/worg/ is used in a paragraph, it is a link.

 WHY?
 Because, while in both cases, in a property drawer and in a paragraph, the URL https://orgmode.org/worg/ is matched by the regexp org-link-any-re:

Overall everything works well except that I cannot get the spell checker to work. I installed aspell (also via homebrew) but when I add (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode) I get the following error message: 
 Error enabling Flyspell mode: (Searching for program No such file or directory ispell)
 It appears emacs does not look for aspell in the right path. Ant advice how to get this to work?

 Seriously, I dedicated a solid 2 months to learning emacs and org-mode this Jan, Feb (continuing to learn while using Agenda after that), and I feel like I have a super power that I never had before. I can "consume" so many little things, ideas, habits, reminders, etc., throw them into my system/schedule, and I've become about 1000% more productive, maybe more. 
 (But to be clear, I'm ADHD and was scatter brained before. And it's not just org mode that's helping me, it's also how I'm using it.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to ge the ol-emacs-slack package (see github issue here) working but am having some really weird results while debugging. I was hopeing someone more experience could provide some ideas.
 At the heart of it, there is a function ol/slack-store-link that I am trying to debug. Whats weird is that if I debug by stepping through the function in edebug it works but if I evaluate the function and evaluate it interactively it breaks. In particular the offending lines always seem to relate to somthing like (oref object attribute)where I get some error about attribute being void.
 The function does rely heavily on (I think) the EIEIO object system... could that have something to do with it?
 Anyone have any idea what could possibly cause that? I am sorry this is such a vague question but trying to create a reproducible example is clearly not so straightforward right now.
 ​
 EDIT: I figured it out. It was missing libraries adding (require 'eieio) and (require 'cl-lib) fixed it. Man that was annoying.

 Usually, left/right quotes and em dashes are the culprits. I go in and replace them by hand, but this is annoying. Is there a customizable setting to either automatically strip these unencodable characters on save, or specify (eg. with an alist) what characters to transform them to?
 Admittedly I'm not super familiar with different text encoding schema, so I'm asking this partly to bypass having to spend a few hours reading up. Resultantly, I'm not averse to changing my files to use a specific encoding that would bypass this issue entirely, as long as 1) it's reasonably future-proof and 2) I can still reliably isearch for these 'problem' quote marks and em dashes (ie. simple " character would still find them).

 The rebuild of the application and all dependencies proceeds as expected. Hoeever, running the generated executable fails with two messages stating that libwinpthread-1.dll and libgg_s_seh-1.dll can't be found.
 Both libraries are installed under the relevant GHC version directory.
 Have I overlooked part of the installation process? 
 Do I need some specific cabal options to get these libraries linked?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
How do people use the terms "zettelkasten" and "personal wiki"? What are the defining characteristics of each and how are they related according to your vocabulary?
How I use the terms:
A zettelkasten is a collection of notes in which the notes are not categorised into different folders, but organised via unambiguous links between each other (and optionally tags). There is no restriction on the type of notes that a zettelkasten can contain.
A wiki is a special kind of zettelkasten that only contains notes about objects. The links between notes are usually created automatically: a link is inserted whenever a term is mentioned that refers to an object on which there is a note in the wiki. A personal wiki would be a wiki on which only one person works, which is usually not intended for the public.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the category "things I wrote because I wanted them for my own use", I released a pre-alpha of emacs-codeql
 CodeQL is GitHub's static analysis toolchain and its primary IDE support is targeted at VSCode, there also exists a neovim plugin which served as the primary inspiration for this package in terms of feature parity goals.
 emacs-codeql is fairly opinionated package that includes an emacs-tree-sitter based indentation and syntax highlighting mode for the QL language as well as a transient driven interface to interact with CodeQL databases, run partial or full queries, view ASTs, and other such activities. 
 It provides a full xref backend for database archive source files and also works over TRAMP (2.5.x recommended). It comes with automagic point-synchronization between source file buffers and their AST buffers as well as a lot of other small quality-of-life features focused on making CodeQL query development a low-friction experience on emacs. 
 For LSP support emacs-codeql recommends and cleanly integrates with eglot. It also depends on Projectile for project-root detection for eglot's new workspaceFolders initialization, which is required for the CodeQL language server to operate properly.
 Since the intersection between emacs users and emacs users that also use this one very specific static analysis toolchain is likely not that big, I don't expect this to be very popular. But I wanted to share it with the broader community to save someone else the hassle just in case.
 I'll be putting a lot of mileage on this package myself, so expect a pretty active feature churn in the coming months. As it stands emacs-codeql is ready to be used for most all general CodeQL use cases.

A lingering question I've had for a while: is it possible to turn off the word count that appears on the bottom of the editor whenever a note is selected? I generally don't mind it, but in some instances it can get a bit distracting to start building anxiety about how few words I've actually written over the last 30 minutes (or however long).]]></summary>

I have a newtype that wraps a tuple and several functions that act on this tuple. Some functions use both elements, and others only use one of them. These two elements would live in separate tables in the database.
 I planned to have a function (let's call it getTuple) that creates the tuple by using two functions (let's call them getA and getB) that independently query the two tables. If I use getTuple in an endpoint that only needs A, would getB also get called?
 This possibility would be great if it were the case. That way, I wouldn't have to expose getA or getB, nor would I worry about optimization since the function would only query the relevant, minimum data from the database.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an honest question. Evil for vim-style key bindings seems to be dominantly popular now, among recommendations, preloaded distributions, and everywhere. What are compelling reasons NOT to use Evil in 2022? 
 I actually have never tried it myself, but now isn't for a convincing reason -- I just built my muscle memory on vanilla bindings and a few years ago added God Mode and helpers like Transient, so my reasons are more momentum than actual recommendable wisdom. 
 Is there a reason users, new and experienced, should decline to use Evil?
 EDIT I accidentally sparked the Holy War, which was not my intention. I should have explained where I was coming from with this. I have the opportunity to onboard college students to Emacs for work. It has been tempting to use one of the big dawg packages out there, Doom or Spacemacs, and I know that both of them use Evil. I have also had recommendations to use Evil pop up in discussions about ergonomics and my Planck keyboard. That bulk of recommendations are where the "dominant popularity" view came from.
 Perhaps I should have rephrased my question as to whether I should have my new developers use Evil bindings (a la one of the popular packages).
 Thanks for the bulk of the answers here; most have been insightful and useful data points.

It could takes hours to complete if we were to use raw JDBC APIs because of the way SQL database holds lock on the tables etc. Using stored proc to do the job isn't a good option so is there any good Scala or Java application framework to accomplish this task with performance efficiency? How can I achieve concurrency and a smaller size commits with the help of such framework? Thanks

I went in and manually changed all the values to the correct value but when exporting, it goes back to the wrong way. Below is a similar setup where in my setup they show up as 4/5 after the table but when exporting they show up as 1/2.
  * Header 1) a 2) b 3) c table 4) d 5) e 
 Edit: Fix found in the link below, edited the table below to show it, in case someone cared.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am a beginner in Haskell interested in learning about the ways to manage/reason about effects in Haskell. I am working on a project with a lot of concurrency and effectful code in an imperative language, so I am also curious to see if there's anything I can borrow from Haskell and apply to the project to reduce complexity and allow me to reason about the side-effects that happen in the code and how they affect state.
 Where should I look to start learning about the ways to manage/reason about effects in Haskell? Are there any must read papers/articles/tutorials on the topic? 
 Right now I am reading/learning about monad transformers so I can try out the mtl library, is this the place to start? Where should I go after mtl, I have seen polysemy and fuse-effects are popular libraries.
 Thanks!

 My question is, in 2022, do I face any (likely) issues if I rebind C-m to something I actually use? I mostly use emacs on X. Single-key shortcuts are rare, and I would like to use as many as possible without breaking anything.

The effect semantics zoo by Alexis King
Not all effect systems implement the same semantics, particularly when so-called “scoping operators” are involved. This document collects examples that serve as useful “acid tests” for distinguishing a given effect system’s semantics.
From Partitions to Wordle - Type Safety with Phantom Types
Oops! It looks like we put things in the wrong order. The fix is simple, of course, just swap the order in the tuple. But it’d be nice if we could prevent these sorts of mix-ups from happening in the first place.

 It works well in an emacsclient session. But when I close that session after starting emacsclient again winner-mode has forgotten all layouts.
 "No further window configuration undo information" is the message.
 I would assume this should work because the winner-mode runs in the context of the still running daemon and client.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have this thing:
 data Thing a = Thing a data AbstractThing a = StaticThing (Thing a) | DynamicThing (Thing a {- 'cached' -}) (forall m. SomeConstraint m -> Thing a -> m (Thing a) {- 'update' -} 
 i.e. an AbstractThing is either a static record, or it's a record that can be updated in some environment. 
 I then have two categories of Thing; a Thing A, a Thing B, and AnyThing = Thing (Either A B).
  
 I can make prisms easily enough that convert Thing A to AnyThing and AnyThing to Maybe (Thing A).
 
I can even make prisms that convert AbstractThing A to AnyAbstractThing and AnyAbstractThing to Maybe (AbstractThing A), though these are quite messy to write.
 
I can write functor instances for Thing .
  
Is AbstractThing a similar construct? It's not a functor because the update function is contravariant. I thought it could be a Profunctor because it's covariant in cached and contravariant in update, but it only has the 1 type variable. "Why do you want it to be a construct?" - because when writing the prisms for AnyAbstractThing, it looked like a pattern was emerging (StaticObject and cached just delegate to the prisms defined over Thing, but the prism functions for the update function are similarly wrapping/unwrapping).

 Edit: Added question, why is there no right side equivalent of drop? drop will remove elements from the left, but is there something to drop from the otherside? Seems oddly asymmetric

 After upgrading to 28.1, the first and last lines work, but the scroll-bar foreground does not. It remains black.
 Here's the strange part. If I execute that line manually after startup, nothing happens. But if I first set it to white manually, then it does work:
 (set-face-foreground 'scroll-bar "white") (set-face-foreground 'scroll-bar "LightSlateGray") 
 However, that only works if I do it manually. If I put those two lines at the end of my ~/.emacs, it doesn't work and I still have a black scrollbar.
 It's not a huge deal but I do wonder what's going on.

 It's really great, it doesn't need to run in the background - it's very stable, and provides a quick way to navigate down branches of a tree (when basic undo/redo isn't enough).
 I've been testing it and reported a few bugs that were fixed by casouri, I've also made some minor contributions & optimizations myself.
 I think this package is ready for general use, recommend others give it a go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
I'm in the process of switching over from Obsidian to the Archive, in an attempt to make my note taking less distracted and more future-proof. As I understand it now, the best way to future-proof linking files is to enclose only the note ID in square brackets and put the title outside of it, instead of enclosing the whole title in brackets. I realize that by doing that I'm giving up easily linking whenever I go back to Obsidian, Zettlr, Bear or other note-taking apps, right? While this is of some concern to me, my main concern has to do with the seemingly immense work that would go into changing all the links in my Zettelkasten to this new format. I currently have around 700 notes and I don't even know how many links. To do this manually would take so much time and energy that I'm doubting if it's worth it. Does anyone maybe know of a way to do this efficiently, without having to manually change all the links?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intuitively speaking, a foldable allows you to list all it's elements and a functor allows you to apply a function to all its elements. But if a foldable contains elements surely you can map over them! Well no... Sometimes you don't want to and sometimes you actually can't.
 Consider Set for example. Given a set you can turn it into a list. But since Set is implemented using some sort of balancing tree that makes use of the Ord instance to provide fast membership lookup, simply fmaping over it will destroy that carefully crafted structure. It is possible to write a Functor Set instance, but it would make it useless as a set.
 But these are just "arbitrary" rules that we impose on the data structure. Here is an example of a foldable for which no functor instance can be implemented:
 data OnlyInt b where OnlyInt ::Int -> OnlyInt Int instance Foldable OnlyInt where foldMap f (OnlyInt i) = f i 
 I also see no laws for foldables that would forbid data WeirdBool a = WeirdBool a (a -> Bool) to be foldable.
 All three of these data types are foldables that aren't traversable, simply because they already fail to be functorial. What eludes me is, whether or not there are any foldable functors, that cannot have a traversable instance. If foldable+functor would be equivalent to traversable, then could you write sequenceF :: (Functor f, Foldable f, Applicative m) => f (m a) -> m (f a)? I sure as hell can't. But just because you cannot proof that equivalence in haskell doesn't mean it isn't true (I think Gödel's incompleteness theorem applies, but I only know the pop-science interpretation).
 However if they aren't equivalent, then there must be a data type that is foldable and functorial. But I have failed to find one so far...
 I think about it from time to time and would really like to know the answer. So I hope that someones knows more!

 Basically matlab / https://octave-online.net/ appears to automatically compute the multiplicative inverse of a non-regular matrix using " the minimum norm least-squares solution" described on this page: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mldivide.html 
 I want to know if emacs calc can do that or if there is a package that might help me out. 
 I know the easy answer to this solution is to use matlab or octave-online, which I've done and that works; however I'd like to use emacs for this if possible.
 If this isn't currently available it's not the end of the world. I'm just learning as I go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am using neovim with telescope fuzzy finder. And in my free time I am forcing my self to learn Emacs (purcell's emacs.d) for personal project development. And want to cultivate habit of it (my personal choice). I want to ask few question regarding how to achieve something that I am habituated to do with neovim + telescope? I am not trying to mimic but it is kind of ease of life improvement for me.
  
projectile-find-file give me that bottom split window (hope window is correct term) to search file but I am missing fuzzy search, it is regex search by default. Can I make it fuzzy?
 C-x f gives me bottom split for find-file (like directory lookup) but again it is regex, is it possible to make it fuzzy. (if doesn't work that is fine, this is kind of curiosity question)
 In above both cases, projectile-find-file and C-x f how can I open file in vertical split of horizontal split directly. For example, in neovim + telescope I fuzzy find the file and pressing C+v or C+x would give me vertical and horizontal split respectively. Is it possible to achieve something like that behavior natively? I am open to use external packages as well.
  
​
 In .emacs.d config from purcell, there are some config regarding switch-to-buffer-other-window things but I not sure about it.
 (global-set-key [remap switch-to-buffer] 'consult-buffer) (global-set-key [remap switch-to-buffer-other-window] 'consult-buffer-other-window) (global-set-key [remap switch-to-buffer-other-frame] 'consult-buffer-other-frame) (global-set-key [remap goto-line] 'consult-goto-line) 
 Any help would be great. Thank you all for reading it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every once in a while, it's nice to have each constructor of a type be distinguishable by type. When this comes up you can often work with a GADT that assigns a different tag to each constructor, and live with the pain of an existential wrapper when you don't know what constructor something will need to return. But doing this always has the cost of needing to introduce types to serve as the per-constructor tags, and I was wondering if I could do better.
 I realized that with DataKinds and PolyKinds, it was possible to refer to any constructor in the same type argument, so I decided to see what would happen if I tried it:
 {-# Language DataKinds, GADTs, StandaloneKindSignatures, PolyKinds #-} import GHC.Types type Foo :: forall k. k -> Type -> Type data Foo tag a where First :: a -> Foo 'First a Last :: Foo 'Last () 
 And, well...
 :6:23: error: • Data constructor ‘First’ cannot be used here (it is defined and used in the same recursive group) • In the first argument of ‘Foo’, namely ‘'First’ In the type ‘Foo 'First a’ In the definition of data constructor ‘First’ | 6 | First :: a -> Foo 'First a | ^^^^^^ 
 Is this restriction serving an important purpose? Could it be relaxed to some extent such that this case, at least, would succeed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Sorry if this is not the place to ask. I'm learning Scala and I stumbled upon this piece of code. I understand the concept of mapping, functional programming, pure functions and the "case" keyword, but I don't understand why is it calling .pure[F], what it is and where is that coming from in line 36. Like, why is it not doing e.toEligibilityStatus() ? 
 Can someone give me a hand?
 I pasted the function that its being called bellow the method just so you can see it, but originally it is under a separate implicit class.

I used it a bit for school but learned nothing about how to modify it etc. Recently I installed Doom Emacs which is very cool, and then I found out about Emacs Application Framework. Unfortunately I have no idea how to install it on Doom because the guide only talks about vanilla emacs. I found a reddit thread about it which also cites a github discussion, but unfortunately I have no idea what they are talking about. I tried to do some stuff without understanding. I am not 100% sure what I did but it didn't really work and I don't even know for sure how to get everything back to where it was before I added anything and start trying again.
 It would be very appreciated if someone could help me with the installation process and tell me step by step exactly what you do and maybe why.

 I can't find any concrete information as to how to run a unit test. According to the comments in the default configuration that I used, some combination of posframe and dap-mode can be used for this, but I can't see specifically how. Specifically, if I'm editing a ScalaTest test class, I'd like to be able to run all of that tests within that class (and ideally I'd like to also be able to run an individual test within the class), and get some visual feedback as to the result.

 'kill-buffer-and-windowis bind toC-x 4 0`
  
I am quit new to Emacs 27. Searching around how to modify key bindings gives me a lot of possible solutions. The question is not how to do it but how to do it the right emacs way.
  
kill-buffer should be unbind
 'kill-buffer-and-windowshould bind toC-x k`
  
And what does happen if someone tries to "override" a key-binding (before unbinding it) or when using one keybinding for two different functions? Do I need to take care of this or does Emacs this for me?
 What I tried so far is Lisp (global-unset-key (kbd "C-x k")) (global-set-key (kbd "C-x k") 'kill-buffer-and-window)  Seems that this works. But I am not sure if it is a good way and if this has some side effects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon dear Haskell wizards of this amazing community.
 I hope I am permitted the honor to post a help request here. I am working on a little side project, likely one of my first more serious projects with Haskell that actually works and is teaching me a lot while working on it.
 This project has one purpose: to be a tool that can be installed to a Unix system, configurable with YAML, that can add, commit and push from several local repositories to remotes. 
 For example I have a knowledge base of markdown documents that I like to have synced to a private GitHub repo, and for that I had a little shell script doing it. 
 Then the idea arose in my head to create something more powerful and configurable that could do this for multiple repos. Of course I love Haskell and want to learn more, and I thought this might be a good way to roll up my sleeves and absorb a lot of knowledge in practice.
 I am sure the code I wrote is not following the best practices, I just have really given it my best with my current knowledge.
 I look forward for your opinions and recommendations. Please checkout the repo at: https://github.com/averageflow/git-autosync

One example is ADTs - beginners often wonder why they're called sum and product types; it's because of the deep connection with actual everyday arithmetic!
 In type systems we have the concept of linear and affine types to refer to functions which use their arguments exactly once, or at most once, respectively. In mathematics, there are the concepts of linear maps and affine spaces. Is there some deep reason for choosing the same name for these concepts? An analogy at least?

 If some kind soul would look at my config and let me know if I've made blues, it would be appreciated. It works but my elisp ain't that good - I want it to ignore '' buffers like \scratch* etc, but not *elfeed-search*.
 ``` (defun bh:iflipb-ignore-buffers (buf) "what buffers to ignore in iflipb" (cond ((equal "elfeed-search" buf) nil) ((string-match "[*]" buf) t)))

 I read quite a bit more than I write and would enjoy a feature with the ergonomics such as the following: 
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/112/actionable-code-folding-in-emacs-fringe
 Has anything changed with "click-able folds" since the above question 7 years ago? 
 Just curious how folks solve this, or if I'm out of the ordinary for missing this functionality. 
 (P.S. I'm on doom emacs and was thinking about attempting to bind mouse clicks to hideshow/vimish-fold for different languages but I guessed with my elisp skills it would get unwieldy fast...) 
 Any tips appreciated, thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The emacs package in my distro has recently been updated from 27.2 (org-mode 9.4.4.) to 28.1 (org-mode 9.5.2).
 In this newer version, org-indent-mode adds a lot of vertical white space in between lines of text. I personally don't like the looks of this but more importantly it's wasting a lot of space on my already cramped laptop screen. I notice that it's not as pronounced when using other fonts but I don't want to change from Terminus.
 The screenshots are captioned with the emacs and org-mode versions and whether org-indent-mode is on or off. Note that the only change from vanilla emacs is setting the default font to Terminus.
 Is this expected behavior? If so, where would I configure this to behave the way it did in 27.2 with org-mode 9.4.4?
 Also, I'm not a fan of the way the STARTUP keyword face is so different from the rest of the buffer. Is there one variable that I can set to make org-mode use the default font everywhere? Or do I have to change each of the dozens of faces individually?

 I'm pre-announcing a major version bump to the base64 library (and subsequently the base16 and base32 libraries) that will be an overhaul of the API. As a result, it's probably best to get out ahead of things and announce it months in advance. In the last version of base64, version 0.4.2.4, a user found a rather annoying and stupid mistake that was clearly the result of fat fingering commands in my editor, and was never caught because there was no real reason to test that particular code. I got very angry at this, because the problem wasn't so much that a mistake had happened, but that if the type of the function had a more reasonable signature, it would never have been allowed to compile in the first place (haha types what are they?).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I just started a new job where I will mainly work on a DSVM (Data Science Virtual Machine), an offering from Microsoft Azure that comes with pre-installed libraries, languages and, amongst other things, emacs. However, after getting in and starting to re-create my .emacs.d I realized that it runs an old CentOS installation for which only emacs 24.3 (https://centos.pkgs.org/7/centos-x86_64/emacs-24.3-23.el7.x86_64.rpm.html) is available. Has anyone been in the same situation? I started using emacs with version 26 so I'm not sure exactly what I'll be missing (other than the fact that certain packages already doesn't install, like use-package which I rely heavily on). Is there a way to build a newer emacs on this old CentOS?
 On my local machine I have to use Windows, but I can still install Emacs 28 so I'm trying to figure out how I could run emacs locally and use TRAMP or something else to edit and ideally also run things on the DSVM. Does this sound like a reasonable workflow? I'm new to TRAMP, but am trying to figure out the setup as we speak.
 To summarize:- Can I build a newer emacs than 24.3 for CentOS 7? I assume not as otherwise someone normally would have done it already (EDIT: MIght have been too fast to post https://justyn.io/til/compile-emacs-28-on-centos-7/)
 - Are there any obvious issue with the TRAMP workflow outlined above where only emacs is installed locally, but all libraries, Python etc. are installed on the virtual machine/remote that I'm SSH-ing into? Would something simple like running a python mode w/ LSP, Flycheck etc. where all the executables are also on the virtual machine work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have previously had emacs 27 as a favorite application in gnome, with the following behavior:
 If no instance of emacs is open, clicking it opens emacs
 If an instance of emacs is open, clicking it brings the current instance to the front.
 However, with emacs 28 I notice that there are two emacs shortcuts available, one called "Emacs" and one called "Emacs (client)". 
 Neither of these replicate the previous behavior.
 The "emacs" application opens new instances of emacs each time. 
 The behavior of "Emacs (client)" is more subtle. If I have opened "Emacs" it sometimes does the right thing and focuses the existing instance, but some times it does not do anything. If no instance of emacs is open, it does open emacs but does not load doom emacs as expected.
 Is there some compiler flag somewhere that I'm missing? I never meant to enable emacsclient.

I wonder whether it would be feasible to have MS/Word as the single tool for the Zettelkasten since it is possible to write hyperlinks to connect to other Zettels (Word slips).
MS/WORD also has a tool to manage the bibliography references.
In this case, each Zettel (Word-created slips) would be filed at the Onedrive or some.
Have you analyzed this situation?

# Geistige Arbeit ist meist nur gerichtet, nicht gezielt

Tätigkeiten in komplexen Kontexten sind nicht vollständig planbar, da man nicht mit Sicherheit vorhersagen kann, was passieren wird. Entsprechend ist es nur bedingt sinnvoll, Ziele zu setzen. Es gibt Tendenzen, die man nutzen kann; Richtungen, die man einschlagen kann.

In der geistigen Arbeit sind es oftmals die unvorhergesehenen Abzweige, die Erkenntnis schaffen und so zum eigentlichen Ziel werden. [@ahrensZettelkastenPrinzipErfolgreichWissenschaftlich2017]

Plane und setz dir ruhig Ziele, aber passe diese an die Entwicklung der Gegebenheiten an. [@sertillangesLebenGeistesSein1951, 119]

Vergleiche mit der "millitärischen Mission" in [@dozReflectionsLeadershipComplexity2017, 9]

When I try to identify key terms sentence by sentence, I come up with the following list:
geistige-arbeit
planung
komplexität
zielsetzung
erkenntnis
richtung
Regardless of the general usefulness (or uselessness) of tags, is this a sensible approach or am I missing something?
I am happy for any other feedback on this Zettel as well, of course.]]></summary>

 I have made an emacs package and I would appreciate any feedback.
 Its name is text-categories located here: https://github.com/Dspil/text-categories
 Its purpose is to make debugging easier, but it might have other use cases. It essentially introduces categories for text. Each character in the buffer belongs to a category. The user can change the current category and every character inserted from then on will belong to the new category. The user can store a category which deletes all of its characters but remembers their position so they can be restored later. A category can also be completely erased. Lastly, the categories can be visualized in a separate buffer and the user can navigate through them in this buffer.
 The main thing I use it for is adding all debugging extra code into a different category. I can switch to the main category and correct the bugs and when I am done, I can erase all the extra code as it all belongs to a different category.

I am taking a course,and I came across a problem where if i input a really large number I get ERROR - Garbage collection fails to reclaim sufficient space . I have tried a couple of things but so far i am unable to make it work.(I am using Hugs). I am not allowed to use lists or anything else that is not already in my code. ```compress :: Integer -> Integer compress n |n == 0 = 1 |((n<10)&&(n>0)) = n |otherwise =valid(calc n)
 calc :: Integer -> Integer calc num |num == 0 = 1 |((num<10)&&(num>0)) = num |otherwise = calc (check(num div 10)) * (check(num mod 10))
  When running that input the hugs interpreter -> compress (137128)  i am getting that error,but it works fine with smaller numbers. So far I have tried not to calculate everything in theotherwise``` condition but Im not successful. I need to multiply every digit of a number,and do it again with the result until the number is smaller than 10.
 Edit 1: when a digit=0 is considered as 1.
 EDIT 2 ``` valid :: Integer -> Integer valid num |num == 0 = 1 |((num <10)&&(num>0)) = num |otherwise= compress num
 check :: Integer -> Integer check num |num==0 = 1 |otherwise = num ```
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm probably going to butcher this question.
 I have a trait being used as a variant type (for a dummy interpreter) with a bunch of Conversion methods. Here's a simple example:
 ```scala sealed trait Variant
 case class Fixnum(i: Int) extends Variant case class Flonum(f: Double) extends Variant case class Str(s: String) extends Variant
 // Variant <-> Int here, figure the others exist as well... given Conversion[Int, Variant] = Fixnum(_) given Conversion[Variant, Int] = _ match case Fixnum(i) => i case Flonum(f) => f.toInt case _ => throw Exception("type err") ```
 Now, I can use the above to pass my Variant type to any function that takes an Int and it works as expected. However, what I can't seem to do is use an Int as a generic type parameter like so (shortened for clarity):
 ```scala // works fine.. def unaryIntPrim(f: Int => Variant)(xs: List[Variant]): List[Variant] = xs match case x :: xs => f(x) :: xs
 // doesn't compile.. def unaryPrim[A](f: A => Variant)(xs: List[Variant]): List[Variant] = xs match case x :: xs => f(x) :: xs ```
 I can understand why unaryPrim doesn't compile, but presumably there's a type constraint I can add to A to ensure "can be implicitly converted from a Variant" or an implicit argument I can add that ensures the conversion is possible?
 I can get rid of the compile error by matching against the type (x : A), but it warns that the type check cannot be performed at runtime, which makes me think that isn't going to work either.
 Any thoughts on how I might be able to accomplish the above would be great. Thanks!

 Each container ideally ought to act like a pure function, it has no internal state so that when these pods are restarted they can plug back into the message passing category.
 Functional programming idioms like map, reduce is recreated as distributed equivalents like MapReduce.
 By severely limiting what containers can do they are turning containers into functions. In AWS Lambda server-less movement, they literally call their construct a function.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just tested out Emacs 29 on Arch today, and the pixel-scroll-precision-mode is really quite smooth! I'm very content with it until I noticed one big problem: 
 If the scrolling doesn't stop exactly at full lines, that is, if the top of the frame is cutting the top half of some line, then as soon as the user starts editing with the cursor, the Emacs buffer will "adjust" itself such that the top of the frame is starting with a whole line, often through scrolling a few pixels up or down. This results in a visual jitter when the user is done scrolling (e.g. with the trackpad) and right after one starts using the keyboard to edit the text.
 I'm not sure if I've articulated the behavior clearly enough, but I'd love to know if others are facing the same issue, and whether there are workarounds for this. One potential solution that I could think of is to "perform the pixel adjustment" (if needed) right after the user "stops" scrolling. Because it's less distracting then than when the user starts typing.

 I am not elist hacker, but I checked there are password-store-executable, auth-source-pass-filename variables where I can overwrite some default values but can I define more than one value (or regex) for each? Pls help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things I miss from non-Haskell languages, is that when I look at the "type" of a function, the library author has named the parameters and I can see what names they chose. e.g.
 int div(int dividend, int divisor) 
 but in Haskell I get a more opaque Int -> Int -> Int. Has anyone else considered attaching names to the types of args? e.g.
 {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-} import GHC.TypeLits type (n :: Symbol) ~= a = a div' :: (Integral a) => "dividend" ~= a -> "divisor" ~= a -> a div' = div 
 Is there a cost to this beyond mild revulsion from a potential library user and a few extra strings being thrown around by GHC at compile time?

 Hey you, unconditional Emacser, fanatic Org user, fearless Elisp programmer,
 This post is for you :)
 We all have different needs when it comes to taking notes. Fortunately, with org-mode many workflows are possible.
 In my case, my notes consist of:
  
some pieces of text (almost no markups),
 many code snippets (inside source blocks) and,
 many, MANY links to specific places (function, variables, ...) in repositories that I cloned on my machine.
  
Today I want to talk about links.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve just finished reading the amazing book from Sönke Ahrens about “How to take Smart Notes”(1). As a visual thinker and sketchnoter my first idea was to use this method to combine visual thinking with networked thinking. Taking smart notes is great, but taking smart sketchnotes would be even greater.
To summarize the content of a book like this within one sketchnote is not that easy. So I started to summarize one main aspect witch is important for a reader of Ahrens’ book to work with the Zettelkasten method. It’s the major workflow starting with filling the inbox till using the content of the growing slip-box to produce an output of higher value. I added the tools I’m using in this process and also the page numbers from the book as a reference for further reading and understanding the underlying method.
You are also working with Obsidian and Zettelkasten? Do you see any differences between your own and the workflow described by Sönke Ahrens?

 This post is neither a tutorial, nor am i asking for help. I just needed a platform where i could finally share my appreciation for org-mode and emacs in general as none of my peers share that fascination. 
 I'm in the process of writing my bachelor-thesis, and emacs/org-mode generally helped me a lot over the course of my studying. From software assignments using various major-modes and LSP to note-taking using org-roam, literate-programming using org-babel, version-controlling everything with magit and server administration using TRAMP. 
 Unfortunately, we have to use our University's LaTeX Template and converting the template to org would take time that i currently don't have. Otherwise, i would prefer writing everything in org-mode...
 At the very least, i can use it for literature aggregation, note-taking (org-noter) and running various statistics!
 The following screenshot shows org-mode using DoomEmacs (own configuration is on my todo list).
 I use ess and literate programming to quickly write and document various statistic functions on my database, which i can then import in LaTeX. 
 Thanks org-mode <3
 So, a big THANK YOU to everyone involved and the helpful posts I've seen on this sub. You all make my student-life way more exciting.

Why are there games in emacs by default. I just don't get it. Even if I was held at gunpoint, I wouldn't play Tetris and alike bs.

I'm assuming this is down to the differing strength of the two type systems but I'm still unsure. Generally, I'm just curious about the differences in modularity, code reusability and purity, polymorphism and behaviour towards IO. Thanks in advance.

E.g. ITheoretically in an Emacs config with 1,000,000 lines of code, is it simply loading an entire config into memory on startup and the resulting performance is the same?

I am a Fantasy writer and artist, my Zettelkasten helps me to make research (architecture, techniques, History, military History, sciences, engineering, religions, mythology…) and create new ideas to my novels and worldbuilding. I am passionate about art and technic as well so I make a lot of notes about technical points (is gomme arabic suitable to make an emulsion ? Is it a good approach to build up a character through my novel ?) or between artists and their style. I note my ideas of creation as well (and my brain is so much faster than my fingers). I take piece of humour as well (punchlines,  comical every day life event…). And I love medecine for some reason.
I read the forum and the website since one year or more, I don't remember, but they were really helpfull to build up my writting process and I am here a little to bring up some of my thoughts if I can add something interesting, but much more to thank you all for helping me through your texts and messages.
English is not my mother tongue, and I am quite rusted, so my writing would not be as precise or as subtle as I want to be, so I am sorry in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much like we see with NERDTree/NvimTree etc, I'm hoping to create a toggleable tree of links (hopefully configurable as an org-file) that I could then use to quickly navigate through "sections" of my emacs files collection. 
 (think Notion sidebar if you have not seen this or logseq's favourites sidebar.).
 Is there a canonical way to do this (or even a package I have not seen) to easily allow this? 
 The use case is providing the quick ability to navigate and hop to various "sections" in my org-roam (and yes, while I realize this is slightly superfluous with the ability to jump between buffers with C-x b, for some reason, I find having the sections in my face much of the time keeps me weirdly focused on my higher level concerns.).
 thanks!
 Daryl.

 I am trying to create an effect, F e, that is capable of loading entities (es) from a repository and saving them.
 The repository could be anything (e.g., in-memory with Refs, a SQL/NoSQL database, Redis).
 The entity, e, should be devoid of persistance concerns. Most of our projects work with DDD, so they should devoid as much as possible of infrastructure concerns.
 Also, every F e must implement a save function, that saves the entity e.
 This save function should be dependent on e.
 So if we have a concrete F User, we must have something in scope that knows how to save this F User.
 Likewise, if we have a F (User, Dog), we must have something in scope that knows how to save these two entities, maybe even transactionally.
 I should be able to use it as such:

I know a lot of work has been done in the past to cross-compile Haskell code to iOS, but theoretically I imagine this should be easier on the M1 hardware, as you're at least using the same architecture on your host as you are targeting -- and yet I haven't been able to find any evidence that anyone has actually tried this, or any guides for how one might go about doing this.

 The commands are working fine, but compiling the project (running its tests) affects the value of compile-command, it sets it to the same value as projectile-project-compilation-cmd.
 Is there a setting to prevent that behaviour, as I really want to be able to do both?

 I have been using emacs with around 50 packages installed either directly or as dependencies.
 Emacs is awefully slow to start on my work laptop , around 25 seconds. Some more info :
  
1s for vanilla emacs
 8s empty init.el but with the 50 packages installed
  25 s for the full setup. 
  
The full startup on my windows potato laptop from 2014 is 2s. It is also 2s for a linux VM on the work laptop. 
 I am suspecting some windows group policy settings or antivirus settings. Anyone has faced similar performance drop ? 
 Task manager shows heavy cpu usage during the whole startup 
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm peaceful very new to Megaparsec and Haskell in general, so this is probably a very basic question. I want to write a parser for a simple DSL using Megaparsec and for this I'm following the Megaparsec tutorial here. At the beginning of the tutorial the author provides the following example for constructing a parser for the string "abc": haskell -- Parsec as defined in the library is: -- type Parsec e s a = ParsecT e s Identity a type Parser = Parsec Void Text mySequence :: Parser (Char, Char, Char) mySequence = do a <- char 'a' b <- char 'b' c <- char 'c' return (a, b, c) Here is what I'm trying to understand, char has the signature: char :: (MonadParsec e s m,‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­Token s ~ Char) => Token s -> m (Token s) see docs here. In our case m is Identity and (Token s) is Char, so char 'a' should return Identity Char and therefore the do block in mySequence should resolve to value of type Identity (Char, Char, Char), or am I missing something? My question is, how can the type of mySequence be of type Parser (Char, Char, Char) instead of Identity (Char, Char, Char)? Is this some monad transformer magic in ParsecT that allows for this? Similarly later in the tutorial the author introduces the following example using <|>: haskell pScheme :: Parser Text pScheme = string "data" <|> string "file" <|> string "ftp" <|> string "http" <|> string "https" <|> string "irc" <|> string "mailto" Same thing here, string "data" <|> string "file" has the signature: haskell <|> :: Identity Text -> Identity Text -> Identity Text So how come that it can be resolved to Parser Text and not Identity Text? Thanks a lot for your help! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I'm beginning to learn Scala via a project I got lined up in my work. I want to build SQL queries programmatically. As source I have an Excel file that I read into Databricks using Scala, e.g.
 val apoDF = spark.read .format("csv") .option("header", "true") //first line in file has headers .option("delimiter",";") .option("mode", "PERMISSIVE") .load("dbfs:/FileStore/shared_uploads/[MY_ACCOUNT]/[SOURCE_FILE].csv") apoDF.createOrReplaceTempView("apo") 
 The Excel file contains all info I need to rebuild the SQL statements, like ids, source view (string), object ids...
 So, after reading the Excel file into Databricks I get a DataFrame.
 The data I need from this file as multidimensional array would look like this:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/hmcgc5xbuar81.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b0a5bca137992544b67ca9871e2fb14a8c65c1a
 Since I'm coming from webDev / php I still think in multidimensional arrays and the concept of DataFrames is new to me.
 What is best practice? Should I build a multidimensional array first and query afterwards the data I need from it? Something tells me that this wouldn't make that much sense since all data is available already in the dataFrame?
 What I am trying right now is to localize the data I need and store in a variable, e.g.
 val uViewName = spark.sql("SELECT View_Name FROM apo WHERE Param_Id = 2869169") uViewName.show() 
 This could be packed into a function .... or method of class?
 Thanks for any advice, much appreciated!

 I am trying to emulate a (nice) resonance Calendar approach I have in Notion (and also looked at doing same with markdown and neovim), but have yet to fiund a good workflow that centralizes a stacked list of various "stuff" (books + notes + Kindle highlights from Readwise, youtube videos and notes, movies I watch, post I read etc) and then lets me write notes on it, and have it say listed in a chronological order automatically.

 It works sooo well that I think this is a dream. 
 I wondering how hard it was for Emacs team to implement this feature. I guess it may sound "gimmick" for Emacs poweruser but for me, it's very usefull, specially when scrolling long files.

 Background
 The downloads page of haskell.org suggests using ghcup and stack to obtain a toolchain. These two tools are widely used in the community, actively maintained and kept up-to-date. The page also provides a number of "alternative installation options" (see below, or on the page itself, for the list).

 Is there anything like this in emacs?
 Notable things about this screenshot (beyond the the obvious): the two viewports are synced, so if you scroll one the other scrolls. The one on the left actually has the _full_ git blame (showing the source code it's blaming) hidden off to the right. Not sure that last bit is useful. 
 This visualization of git blame works WAY better for me than anything I've found yet. I'd _love_ it if one of you would say "oh, just use ______ package to get this." ;)

 Here's an experimental package which converts a unified diff into an inline diff, collapsing changed lines into a single line where green shows the added part and reddish color shows the removed part. Here's how it looks:
 https://i.imgur.com/Jn6Tffp.png
 I made this package as an experiment to test how useful it is. Currently, it works with files under git when you compare it to the latest commited version (C-x v =), but it shouldn't be hard to make it generic. I'm just putting it here, in case someone finds this useful.

Never liked using those big IDE but, since my whole team uses VS Code, I thought to give it a go and generate the least amount of friction on the first week. Yeah, didn't like.
 BUT what I've loved was a VS Code extension named "auto doc string" which could automatically create a doc string and already place some information, like which arguments, what are the returns and, most important, type annotations were reflected in the doc string.
 Sure, there must be a package in emacs that could do all that, right? I have yet to found it. The closest I got was yasnippet-radical-snippets, but it doesn't support types (yet).
 Does anyone know a better tool for the job?

 I would like to type: M-x link TAB, and see markdown-insert-link as one of the first options in the completion list, because markdown-mode is currently active. I don't want to have to enter 'markdown', that should be inferred from the context.
 I thought that a menus commands completion could be pretty close to what I'm looking, since often menus have the most relevant commands for the active modes.
 I've found LaCarte library, that lets me execute menu-bar menu commands from the keyboard, using completion. That's pretty close to what I want, but its icycles completion is not working very well for me.
 I wonder if there other options out there? Or ideas on how to implement? (I can do some Emacs lisp).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came up with a cute method to turn a grammar into a parser, and I wondered if it was something that people have done before.
 Basically, the idea is you unfold the grammar into a set of all the trees it produces (using a data structure built with Free), and then fold this structure into a combinator parser. For the fold and unfold, I use the recursion-schemes library (which conveniently knows exactly how to unfold and fold Free structures).
 Here's the code of a simple version. In practice, I added a fancier recursion scheme (gchrono), more use of megaparsec, and a fancier grammar, but this is the core idea:
 ```

 I'm using async-shell-command instead of 'compile'-command because of reasons, I managed to enable compilation-minor-mode but it doesn't go to the first error - even if set compilation-auto-jump-to-first-error to true. Invoking (first-error) in the buffer goes to the first error though.
 Can compilation-mode/minor-mode list errors and warnings in a good readable format like flycheck does without much customization?
 
 Reasons why I am not using M-x compile: I am using xcodebuild (for iOS development), when its done I check for errors or if the build succeeded. If its succeeded it will install the binary and launch the simulator and then parse the logs. If you have a connected iPhone/iPad it will install and launch it on device and start the lldb. I wanted it to be very automatic (like Xcode)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have recently been playing around a bit with helm for my personal use and, though helm per se is absolutely great, i have found the lack of documentation to be extremely annoying. Now I get it, its open source etc. and just read the source code, but I have been unable to figure out quite a few things from the source.
 So, my first question: Can anybody point me towards some good helm documentation that is not the wiki(https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki), which is extremely lacking if you want to write your own sources instead of just using helm and that is not outdated (like this https://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/01/24/Anatomy-of-a-helm-source/).
 Then two more questions:
  
How can you do multiple columns in a helm source? For example, helm-mini shows file size,name, absolute path etc., all in different columns.
 How can you show something, but not make it searchable. Say I have a special source for various user-defined commands, and I want to provide not only the name, but also a short description of it, or its keybindings etc, without including them in the filtering, like helm-M-x does.
  
​
 EDIT:Here the answer by the current helm maintainer (I think) -> https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/discussions/2493 (Summary: Use :match-part to only match against parts of the options). Thanks a lot for the extremely fast answer. Also, there really needs to be a better helm documentation. It is such a great tool, but anything other than the most basic extensions requires you to dive into the source code/ask the maintainer, which is less than ideal, I think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the example, handwritten, optparse-applicative CLI parser that I'm trying to generics-sopify-
 import Data.Functor import Options.Applicative data AllParams = FirstThing FirstParams | SecondThing SecondParams data FirstParams = MkFirstParams {fooOne :: String} data SecondParams = MkSecondParams {fooTwo :: Bool, fooThree :: ()} paramP :: ParserInfo (AllParams, FilePath) paramP = info (optP <**> helper) ( fullDesc <> progDesc "Example CLI" <> header "Example CLI" ) where optP = liftA2 (,) commandsP outputPathP commandsP = hsubparser $ mconcat [ command "FirstThing" $ info (firstCommand <&> FirstThing) $ fullDesc <> progDesc "Use first with given parameters" , command "SecondThing" $ info (secondCommand <&> SecondThing) $ fullDesc <> progDesc "Use second with given parameters" ] firstCommand = MkFirstParams <$> strOption ( long "fooOne" <> metavar "String" ) secondCommand = MkSecondParams <$> option auto ( long "fooTwo" <> metavar "Bool" ) <*> option auto ( long "fooThree" <> metavar "()" ) outputPathP = strOption ( short 'o' <> metavar "FilePath" <> help "Output Path" ) 
 In general, this is pretty straightforward, AllParams is the overarching CLI type. Each constructor within designates a command subparser and its field type designates a record type containing all the options for this specific subparser.
 I'm generalizing/automating this pattern using generics-sop. The code is quite large so I'll post it in this gist.
 I'm curious whether that implementation could be simplified. By simplification, I'm mostly mean less noise. I'm curious whether there are utility functions, types and constraints provided by generics-sop already that invalidate the need for typeclasses like NSFrom and similar types I've handrolled there. I'd also be curious to know whether certain snippets could be improved in a general sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm JUST beginning to learn clock-in, clock-out. It seems to me that's great if you're always at your computer AND you have the discipline to always work in a clocked-in state. But I have many little or big tasks or projects around the house that I'll work on or complete, and I'd like to be able to add to the task an estimate of the amount of time I spent on it without using the clock-in/out system. 
 For example, today I changed my laptop battery, worked on my digital multimeter, and then checked all my batteries in my battery drawer, threw away the bad ones. I'd like to be able to just mark these tasks as DONE and also directly (and easily) add the hours worked. I might not know the exact start and end time I worked on the project, and I don't want to have to go fudge some clock-in/out time. (Unless there's a super easy way to fudge it!) I suppose it would be something like an HOURS_WORKED property.
 And I'd also like to be able to generate a report of all such activity/time for the day, for the week, for the month, etc. Ideally, that could somehow be combined with my clock report, but I'd be happy even if it were a separate report. 
 Maybe this functionality is already in clock-in/out feature set? If not, is there some package or methodology that might help me out here? (I know there is ALWAYS... SOME way for anything with org mode, of course!)

This does not occur on linux emacs installs or on windows install or on Intel mac. It does happen on brew install of emacs on M1 mac. I would love to get my normal orgmode back 
 And of course the same thing happens in -nw mode.

 I did not have any experience in coding whatsoever before university and learning about Haskell and functional programming was very exciting and eye-opening for me since it showcased a very intriguing way of thinking and reasoning. 
 I was wondering if anyone knew where I could get an internship in Haskell for this upcoming summer. Graham told me that it was kind of hard to get an internship in Haskell if I didn’t have a PhD but any help would be much appreciated :)

 To answer my question for example, I like the idea of [1..10] which will generate the list of ints quickly. I am not looking for very high level concepts like monads (which I am yet to understand), but more of these little things like [1..10] that are super convenient. Things for example you miss when using imperative languages or even other functional languages.

 I am using GNU Emacs 28.0.92 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2022-03-27 on Windows 10.
 The problem is that many (not all!!) unicode-characters in e.b. text are not printed "as they are" but instead "encoded". Certain unicodes have no issue like Umlauts, eg. ö ä ü or ß are all displayed correctly and are properly "uni-"encoded using two bytes. 
 Problem can be seen here:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/ah42nzguuyq81.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4130f7b7b3ae9bec3f6bdc324c7b3c0e2fa8418
 and with many other unicode characters.
 File encoding info is:
 U -- utf-8-dos (alias: mule-utf-8-dos cp65001-dos) UTF-8 (no signature (BOM)) Type: utf-8 (UTF-8: Emacs internal multibyte form) EOL type: CRLF This coding system encodes the following charsets: unicode 
 The file is recognized as having unicode-encoding and saves properly preserving unicode.
 ​
 ​
 It is not a font issue, if I cat or more the file in terminal using the same font, the unicode characters get properly displayed.
 It is not an issue of Windows terminal, if I start emacs -nw from cmd.exe, powershell or Git Bash it's all the same (not from within Windows terminal)
 Note, when I open the same file using the same .emacs configuration in Gui-Mode all Unicode characters display correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used Haskell for a number of coding assignments. I compiled using ghci, and did not touch cabal at all. The system I ran on was managed by someone else and was taken down. I then tried to set things up on my own system, but was forced to abandon ghci for cabal run.
 After fiddling about in the .cabal file I could get rid of most compilation errors by adding depencies, but this one eludes me:
 Main.hs:3:1: error: Could not find module ‘Control.Monad.Par’ Perhaps you meant Control.Monad.Fail (from base-4.13.0.0) Control.Monad.Fix (from base-4.13.0.0) Control.Monad.RWS (needs flag -package-key mtl-2.2.2) Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. | 3 | import Control.Monad.Par | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
 It does not provide a dependency suggestion to add to my .cabal file, and the other options seem unrelated.
 Note that Control.Monad.Par should be there since this is part of an assignment and this file was given to us by the teacher.

 I'd probably use emacs for more in the future, but after realizing how little I used I decided to steer around to vanilla emacs and wow, it's so much faster 0.0
 There's still a fe things Im working out, like how to get the status line to be more like doom's and such (Trying out mood-line right now), disable the gui menu and buttons and such, but it's working very well so far. 
 Plus color me weird, but I kinda like the lisp syntax, maybe I need to dig deeper in it. 
 Plus I got my emacs config placed into ~/.config/emacs but a lot of guides are saying I should use ~/.emacs.d does it really matter where my config is?

 Trying to find resources on how to set this up, and all the more, how to make it gracefully import into IntelliJ has taken me into blog-posts and forums going back to 2014. Am I simply missing it, or is there still no clean solution for this?
 I would prefer not to use a boilerplate, since it would be nice to know how to set this up de-novo, there are quite a lot of moving parts. Does anyone have any current resources on the matter?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, The Archive generates Zettel IDs that are not strictly compliant with with the latest ISO 8601 standard.  According to Wikipedia, since 2019 the ISO 8601 standard requires a "T" to be present between the date and time sections.  It would be great if ISO 8601 compliant Zettel IDs could be incorporated into a future release, preferably as a predefined native option.
I figure, if one is going to use a date and time stamp as an ID (and I can see the benefits of doing so), then the ID may as well be strictly ISO 8601 compliant.
I realise this is pedantic, not massively important, and can easily solved by other means (TextExpander, etc.).  It'd just be a nice touch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, r/haskell,
 We have been working on Chameleon: an interactive type-level debugging tool for Haskell. In 2020 I crowded sourced feedback and ideas on the designing Chameleon on Reddit. As a result, I was overwhelmed by a generous amount of participation and lots of constructive feedback from the wholesome r/haskell community. This time we are running an extended study with more advanced interactive features of Chameleon.
 If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming tool research or checking out our Haskell type-level interactive tools, please click this link to proceed https://blend.ercu.be/consent. We use telemetrics to gather usage data for this study, but it is totally anonymous. We won't ask you for personal data (email, name, phone number, etc.). It will take you about 20 - 30 minutes to complete. But in turn, it will help us immensely.
 If you are interested in this research, there're links to the paper and video at ICFP 2021. You can also check out our repository on Github.
 Thank you,
 Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team

 I have a program that someone else has written. If I run in from the python shell then it works fine. But afterwards that python shell is useless, it won't respond to inputs. (Simple scripts don't suffer from this problem.)
 Why am I asking about this here? It doesn't do this outside of Emacs. If start a python shell from a Windows cmd window then the python shell continues working after the program has ended.

 Actually, that release was made a couple of weeks ago and today we just released 0.20.0 which added the possibility to use raw interpolation inside the cypher queries.

First note
Second note
Then, if Luhmann wanted to insert a note in the system, he'd append a letter running from "a":
First note
Second note
Now, what happens, if Luhmann wanted to insert another new note between note 1 and 1a?  I'm assuming I have misunderstood how his system works, but I can't see what label the new note can be given as there's nothing that can now come before "1a".  Can anyone clarify?]]></summary>

 Is this possible using footnotes? I didn't find an option to set the target location of the footnotes section, or a way to group them per (sub)section.
 I could use internal links instead, using ^{[[note1]]} in the table and a list of notes 1. <<note>> some note below the table, but this doesn't give backlinks. (I suppose I could manually add a link in the other direction but sounds like a lot of effort, while using footnotes is very simple.)

 I'm trying to setup emacs to edit and compile verilog sources remotely. I'm using TRAMP to do this. Editing files runs great, but I don't know how to setup the compile commands to run the verilog parser remotely using emacs compile. Emacs tries to compile it locally.
 -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: "/ssh:user@odcvde:/slowfs/265/users/user/FM_Debugging_Hard_Verifications/hv_labs/lab5/rtl/" -*- Compilation started at Thu Mar 31 16:02:33 /bin/sh: line 2: /ssh:user@odcvde:vlogan: No such file or directory 
 It disobeys also the default shell using sh instead of bash
 Also, misc stuff, I'm having problems with TRAMP and the bash prompt. It initially have problems to detect the prompt, It had bold characters, so I worked around it adding * to the prompt regexp and worked again, but I noticed that there's still some garbage in the shell. Is forcing certain terminal type or changing the prompt a more "robust" solution? 
 Thanks

I have come to like Emacs so much, that I want to take it with me everywhere I go. However, my work uses Windows and won't allow me to install any software so I can run my favorite program from a flash drive with this method:

 Anyone else have a neat portable Emacs setup? I can always use new ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Spacemacs with the Twilight-bright theme, as I like how it uses the background colour in highlights.
 When I run Emacs directly via X, everything works fine but, when I try to use it on a terminal, in some cases the minibuffer text shows the same colour as the background (white), so I can't see anything. One of the examples is trying to open a file in a project with C-x C-f, the minibuffer seems to show the same as the selection in Helm (judging on how the cursor shows at the same location as in the Helm window and it changes when I move up and down) but I can't see what's there.
 It seems to work fine for things like showing me function details from LSP.
 I've looked at the twilight-bright.el and I've not found anything.
 Note: I've been doing some more testing and it looks like the issue is not only related to twilight-bright, but it seems to be related to spacemacs itself.
 The issue happens both, on terminals with white on black and black on white.
 Anybody got any ideas on how to fix this issue or other themes to try?

 Is this expected?
 Can I not restrict the profiling to just my own code?
 Is this a one time thing or will it happen for every new Cabal project?
 I guess the newly installed packages include ways for the RTS to get detailed information from every module, does this add any overhead for a program running without profiling?

A WebAssembly module as an executable
Let’s first clarify why we can treat a WebAssembly module as an
executable file.
Despite the “Web” prefix in its name, the WebAssembly core

defines a bytecode format that describes some computation. The only

 Example: when mousing over a return type annotation (underlined with red to suggest an error) it says:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading the "async" article from FPComplete (https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/library/async/), at the end of the article it gives a "final exercise: implement mapConcurrently using mapConcurrently_".
 According to documentation (https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-13.21/unliftio-0.2.10/UnliftIO-Async.html), the signature of mapConcurrently is as follows:
 mapConcurrently :: MonadUnliftIO m => Traversable t => (a -> m b) -> t a -> m (t b)
 I've implemented mapConcurrently for lists (as a special case of Traversable), so the question is how do I generalize my solution to cover all traversables.
 Is there a way to create a Traversable without knowing its concrete type? I think I'd need to add another typeclass as a constraint, but changing function's type doesn't seem right.
 Also I'm curious about other ways to implement mapConcurrently using mapConcurrently_.
 ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arrows seem like a really useful concept – any time you need to be able to inspect a graph of operations, like to cache operations done repeatedly or to convert them to run on the GPU etc. Normally, all you can get is an opaque function that you can't inspect, but as I understand it with arrows you can decompose the function and decide yourself how to execute it. This means that you can set up things like parsers combinators that can be "viewed" as an abstract grammar, in addition to a parser.
 (An issue of course is that, when using arrows, you can't use the outputs of an arrow to determine what effects to imply. If you could, it would mean you can't statically analyze which effects are going to be dispatched. To do that would mean introducing "higher order arrows" aka ArrowApply, which i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SWAR (SIMD in register) techniques were used in the last release of jsoniter-scala to speed up parsing and serialization on JVM platforms.
 VarHandles from Java 11+ gave access to byte arrays for loading 64-bit values of subsequent 8 bytes and storing 8/4/2-byte values.
 It allowed saving on load/store ops and parallel processing of bytes of JSON input/output. Also, it mitigates redundant index checks when storing bytes to byte arrays sequentially in GraalVM CE.
 Results of benchmarks from Intel® Core™ i9-11900H are here as usually.
 BTW, If you had a positive experience with the library that saved your time due to handy derivation, reduced compilation time of your project due to efficiency of derivation macros, or reduced your spending on infrastructure due to efficient parsing and serialization, then please support its development and testing on different platforms by:

mentioning jsoniter-scala in articles and video records
 
sending your feedback to Gitter chat or GitHub issues

But that is labor intensive, and it makes me delay that administrative task. I'd rather just be able to pick them up directly in emacs as to do items in a file or even just headings in a file would be fine. Or even just single lines in a file I guess.
 Well now that I think about it, I suppose this isn't really an emacs question, but this was the first place I thought of asking since I figured others may have wanted to do this as well, and might have some solutions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using markdown-mode and have the following custom keybinds:
  
C-b puts **|** (| is the cursor), so that the text is bold
 C-i puts *|* so that the text is italic
  
The problem is that I often get in this kind of situation: ( | represents the cursor) 
  
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, **consectetur adipiscing |** elit, sed do eiusmod 
  
When I type something between the asterisks I always leave an appending whitespace inside, before getting out of the enclosing asterisks. 
 One solution could be to interpret a double space as "get out of the enclosing asterisks". This way, if I type another space in the example above, this would be the result:
  
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, **consectetur adipiscing**| elit, sed do eiusmod
  
I'd like this to be possible even for backticks. However, it doesn't seem like an easy task (I'm not a elisp expert, but i could make it through its particular syntax). Is there some hint or already built tool out there that could help me? Thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a challenge problem on the kattis website called Pivot that has a concise solution using a bit of reverse state. Since forward state is needed as well, it's a natural fit for the Tardis monad
 The sample list is:
  
2 1 3 4 7 5 6 8
  
At each element we're to determine if it's greater than the elements before (prior state) and less than the elements remaining (future state). With tardis you can do both at once:
 check :: Int -> Tardis Int Int Bool check num = do modifyForwards (`max` num) modifyBackwards (`min` num) p <- getPast f <- getFuture pure $ p <= num && num < f -- this is a pivot if it's between the prior -- maximum and the future minimum

 Do you have any trustable salary sources? The most I found are published by recruiter companies and I think they tend to say a bit more than it would be realistic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, r/orgmode!
 Since citations in orgmode are now native (hurray!), I've come to wonder whether it is possible to use the same document as the source for the citations.
 Via org-babel blocks it is possible to write a bibliography in orgmode and tangle it to a bib-file. This mechanism is sufficient if you decide to use only one or two org documents for literature summaries, reading lists etc. like Gregory Stein does. But it becomes unwieldy, if you want to use a single file per book/article with self-contained bibliographic information, because you have to create a lot of single bibliographies, that clutter up the org-folder.
 The selfcontainment of bibliographic information seems very attractive for me because single files can be shared without thinking about needed supplementary files. Further, it would be possible to copy bibliographic entries between files and create project-specific bib-files for LaTeX use, without having a huge bibfile, of which the most part stays unused, and still have a consistent bib-key.
 As far as I can see Nicolas Rougier's org-bib-mode doesn't do that, but uses a corresponding bib-file.
 Do you know ways to achieve that or do you think it's a rather stupid idea, that brings a lot of hassle with it?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: New example of using Servant with Okapi here. If anything, I think Okapi could make a nice prototyping tool for getting something out the door quickly. Read more about how to embed Okapi apps into Servant here.
 Hello Community,
 Over the past few weeks I've been working on a new server-side microframework called Okapi (I'm open to name suggestions).
 Okapi is a monadic parser, but for HTTP requests. It's inspired by F#'s Giraffe and the simplicity of web frameworks in other programming languages like Python and Ruby. It's meant to be a simple, idiomatic alternative to other frameworks in the Haskell ecosystem. A summary of what Okapi is can be found here.
 If you're interested in testing Okapi out, take a look at the documentation. I recommend going through the crash course (still finishing it) to get a feel for what you can do with this library.
 To see an example of what a web server built with Okapi looks like, take a look at this implementation of the realworld backend spec. You can use it to compare it to other implementations of the same spec. The Okapi implementation passes all the required tests and is a good idea of what you can expect from the framework.
 Okapi is still in the early experimental stage, so I would highly recommend NOT to use it for production projects or important side projects. The API is subject to major changes. The main reason why I want to show Okapi to the community this early in its' development is to get feedback as soon as possible to make sure this is something worth investing more time into. I'd love to hear opinions from Haskellers and non-Haskellers of all skill levels and backgrounds.
 If you'd like to open an issue or PR, the repo is here. Contributions are more than welcome.

 I know this is lazy but I want one that works out of the box for "text editing, programming", also really interested in EWW and the email apps. Are there any existing distro that are closest to the functionality I want? I want to tinker as least as possible. But willing to nonetheless. Just don't want to do It if there are existing configuration already. 
 Not sure if distro is the correct term, if not please correct me!

 Even better, IMHO would be something akin to how git command work. Namely, by simply having a script on your path named git-*, that script is interpreted as a sub command. So git-stuff would allow git stuff. A similar mechanism in cabal might allow us to experiment with new commands without having to modify cabal itself, not entirely unlike how extensions allow us to experiment with new Haskell features in GHC.

 I tried to make TRAMP work before ending up here, but i just could not TRAMP + LSP working.
 It occurred to me that maybe there would be a way to run an emacs server on the instance and have some kind of a thin client locally. I messed around with forwarding the server socket over ssh, but it turns out that emacsclient will just try and get the server to do stuff on its end. In other words, emacsclient is just an RPC call, not a thin client.
 X forwarding is way too slow.
 Anyone got any other ideas?
 if it wasn't clear - I want emacs running on my server, with a GUI on my laptop.
 I'm envisioning something like a web app - backend <=> frontend

The Zettelkasten is my conversation partner in the process of constructing a draft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a stupd issue where I cannot override view-mode-map keys for some reason.
 The code I want to use is below. F13 binding is working but the others aren't.  (setq view-read-only t) (global-set-key (kbd "<f13>") 'view-mode) (with-eval-after-load 'view-mode (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "f") #'forward-char) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "n") #'next-line) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "p") #'previous-line)) 
 If I remove the with-eval-after-load and just add the following
  (setq view-read-only t) (global-set-key (kbd "<f13>") 'view-mode) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "f") #'forward-char) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "n") #'next-line) (define-key view-mode-map (kbd "p") #'previous-line)) 
 Then I get: Symbol's value as variable is void: view-mode-map.
 I'm still a noob so I might be overlooking something really simple here, any help, please? Thanks in advanced!
 EDIT: forgot to mention that it that if I go to my init file and eval-region on the define-key lines after Emacs loads, it works just fine. I’m also overriding other maps like dired and some others in a similar way and they also work fine.
 EDIT 2: I am trying to replicate this https://gist.github.com/ivan-krukov/63a586f2121519ca51b201c634402a84 but without use-package.

 Can I have emacs trigger a command when I type a specific string in insert mode*? In my use-case I would like my citations keys to become auto-completed somehow when I type '@'.
 '@' is the prefix for citation and references in pandocs markdown. Citation look like '@Nurmagomedov2020' for example, and they are stored in a bibtex file. I currently search and add citations by calling citar-insert-citation, which provides an interface to search my bibtex file and prefix the '@' symbol so that is recognised by pandoc, when I create a document.
 Using completion plugins clearly it is possible for typed text to trigger a function (the completion). Is there a way I can make this work for my citation entry? Alternatively, is there an alternative approach for my specific use case that someone has already implemented?
 Any guidance appreciated, even just a link in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From this discussion, /u/github-alphapapa suggests the possibility of adding the following to the org-mode-hook:
 (when (s-prefix? (expand-file-name "~/org/") (buffer-file-name (current-buffer)) ) (real-auto-save-mode) ) 
 The provides the feature of limiting the real-auto-save-mode to his ~/org/ directory. I'd like to do this (or something similar), but my current cut-and-paste level of elisp knowledge certainly wouldn't work:
 (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (when (s-prefix? (expand-file-name "~/org/") (buffer-file-name (current-buffer))) (real-auto-save-mode)) ) 
 How would I add that functionality to my org-mode-hook?
 Also, what if I might want to extend that to also include some additional arbitrary file or dir? In particular, I might want to add my ~/.emacs.d/init.el, but maybe something else as well!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
First post here!
I am newer to trying out note-taking within the set up the Archive and the Method as proposed on this website.
As I’m seeking to prioritize connections at the beginning, I’m seeing different opportunities. However, I’m finding it difficult in the prose. This makes establishing the connections difficult.
For example, today I was reading about deliberate  practice and how immediate feedback is necessary within the practice session. I thought about how I can make a connection to other notes within the archive. I had another note about failure as a teacher that came from my readings on Toyota and their leadership practices. However, I didn’t know a good way to write out a good connection.
If it would help for me to post the contents of those notes in here I’d be happy to.
Any thoughts on how to do this naturally?]]></summary>

 do you have or know about a windows build where the new cairo support is working well ?
 I like the github: "emacs-build" releases but I'm maybe a lazy and I wouldn't like to built a new one by me or ...

 Is there a way to create a named function, and then use something like an org link to execute the function?
 Specific Use Case
 I have a list of items that serve as the basis for my weekly and monthly reviews. The review document is bullet list with short prompts and links to other files. (e.g., research, notes, agenda, goals, etc).
 However I'm using perspective.el to separate my project management, research and creative work into separate window collections. I would like to add a link that takes me into the relevant perspective rather than simply loading the file or buffer into the current perspective with an org-link.
 If this was webdev, I could add a JavaScript click handler. Is there a simple way to accomplish this without new key-bindings?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a small package textsize to automatically adjust text size when the display changes (mentioned earlier)
 It automatically calculates and applies a point size to the frame's default face, based on monitor size and pixel pitch. I find it invaluable as I switch between a large 4k desk monitor and the laptop when mobile, and presenting on big screens in meeting rooms.
 I just added it to MELPA, and converted it to a minor mode, so anyone already using it will have to tweak config to change (textsize-setup) to (textsize-mode).
 I'd be very happy to hear about issues or desired features (here or on Github). I don't encounter displays that don't report size, but presumably projectors are not reliable for this - is there good generic metadata I could use to detect and compensate for them? At worst I could add overrides by EDID (unique display identifier).
 Also, while the default parameters I came up with work for me, there are many display geometries I just haven't encountered that may be sub-optimal with the defaults(?).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/emacs, long time Vim user here trying to make the switch to Emacs and get it to stick (this time). And one of the recommendations I've seen when it comes to successfully switching is to figure out your emacs workflow and patterns rather than trying to shove Vim into Emacs (evil-mode aside).
 One of the core parts of my Vim workflow was fuzzy finding a file (any file, anywhere) in a project. And I see that there's a way to get similar functionality with projectile or project.el. The problem I've found is on large projects it's too slow, and breaks my focus. But this got me thinking. I very rarely need to jump between many far flung regions of the project I'm working on. And actually, having to search through all files in the project (as quick as it may be) gets annoying in my Vim workflow where there are many files with the same or similar names. 
 So instead, what I'm imagining would work well for me is to fuzzy search for all files in a sub directory of a project. I.e: in executing a custom project-find-file I would first get the option to find a subdir in the project, and then it would operate as regular project-find-file from that subdir.
 Being new to emacs/elisp are there any pointers for how to do this, I would imagine ideally with project.el? Or alternatively, how do you deal with navigating to files quickly (without breaking your focus/flow) in large projects with emacs?
 Thanks in advance! 🙏

 Here is an example of how to use Generically1 to derive an instance:
 type Foo :: Type -> Type data Foo a = Foo [a] a (Int -> Int -> Maybe a) deriving stock Generic1 deriving (Functor, Applicative) via Generically1 Foo 
 While this derives a specific instance it is by no means unique. By the magic of Applicative every such instance has a backwards instance via Backwards (Generically1 Foo) where the applicative effects run in reverse order.
 Generically1 works for a lot of Applicatives but it does not work for sum types. Right off the bat this excludes lists, ZipLists, NonEmpty-lists…]]></summary>

 As per https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Saving-Emacs-Sessions.html#Saving-Emacs-Sessions, 
  
The file in which Emacs saves the desktop is locked while the session runs, to avoid inadvertently overwriting it from another Emacs session. That lock is normally removed when Emacs exits, but if Emacs or your system crashes, the lock stays, and when you restart Emacs, it will by default ask you whether to use the locked desktop file. 
  
So I expected emacs to just load as normal. Why did it open loaddefs.el? And what is that file?

Now that I've finally gotten comfortable with Org Mode, I decided to spend a week writing down a tutorial for new people. This is the tutorial that I wished I had found when I was starting out trying to make sense of all this. 
 I've written a very detailed explanation of my workflow and various Org Mode configurations. It includes screenshots as well as code samples with comments. Please take a look at it and let me know how I can better refine it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a new Haskell book being published by No Starch Press called Functional Programming for Physics Geeks which just recently went into early access. The book is the culmination of the author's decades of experience teaching computational physics using functional programming and it covers Newtonian mechanics and electromagnetism all in Haskell, with emphasis on using strong static typing and compositionality to implement the core ideas of kinematics and dynamics. The author also has a library of code used in the book on Hackage here.
 Personally I love books using Haskell in application areas that are outside the field of software engineering, like van Eijck and Unger's Computational Semantics with Functional Programming, so I am very much looking forward to this book and I thought others might be too. Relive the horrors of undergrad physics, but this time in Haskell!
 I know that the author has written about using Haskell to teach physics before and has been working on this book for a while so maybe people have seen it before but didn't know it was slated to come out this year. The page for the book had been live for a little bit last year but then it disappeared. However it seems to be back up now because early access for the book has opened. The last time I talked to the author he said the goal date for publication was in May, but it seems to be pushed back to October this year.
 (NB I'm not involved in any way with the book, I'm just excited for it and hadn't seen it mentioned yet.)

 I love Diagrams and Gloss libraries in haskell. I wanted to try making something that will enable anyone/me to use it in other programming languages for quick scripts – for drawing simple geometric shapes and animations.
 mindra talks via stdin/stdout, so integrating with it should be easy. So far I have one client library (https://github.com/rorokimdim/mindra-clj) for Clojure.
 I’m at the beginner level in haskell. I’d appreciate any kind of feedback (either on mindra or the haskell code in general). Thanks for reading!

 While encrypting individual headers or entire files is fine and all, I find it rather cumbersome when trying to write something that isn't meant to be entirely encrypted and still structurally have it make sense. With org-mode being hierarchical and all, I can't really just make another heading and then go back to the parent header at some arbitrary point. From what I've understood, adding new babel blocks is rather easy, but I'm not sure if it'd be easy or hard to implement something like this for org crypt. I think it'd be nice to have though.

 Does anyone know of any other articles on API breakage and deprecation cycle policies, in Haskell or any other language? It would be great to collect them together so we can learn from them and reduce the costs of change on Haskell users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is a very open question about emacs workflow with remote work. I’m sharing my thoughts here because I’m stuck and am looking for some useful ideas. It’s more like a very long mumble that you can respond to. There will be no right answers, and please let me know what you think of each of the ideas here!
 Background: I do a lot of machine learning and data analysis, which means I have to use python and R on remote servers a lot. I’ve been trying to find a good workflow from my laptop in emacs. 
 These servers usually have very different dependencies from my laptop since they have GPUs. For example, pytorch, a machine learning learning library, uses different versions for machines with and without GPU. This makes direct sharing of virtual environments or poetry projects difficult.

Last Week
More reading and onboarding "Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson." This is filled with rich material and I'm taking my time.
I'm most excited about the development of a proximity search tool! Having this as a Keyboard Maestro macro is making it useful. Easier and more beautiful searches for interconnecting ideas in my ZK.
This Week
Restarted going to the public gym.
Reorg backpacking gear in prep for this year. First trip in 2 weeks.
Continued onboarding to my ZK "Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson."

 EDIT2: reading the documentation I can install globally with global-undo-tree, but does not look to work properly to me, I open an org file with undo-tree-visualize and says that is not enabled undo tree
 ---------
 I use emacs doom from a mac, starting it with emacs -nw (inside the tab), as I have a really compact keyboard sometimes I press shortcuts I am not aware of, and often the terminal I have been working get closed and I lose all the data I was working on.
 I saw on the internet I can use `recover-file` but there are not trace of my previous changes, I lost already hours of data dozens of times in few months of org usage. Also when I use c-x u or even worse just U, then something can go wrong with redo and also I lose data. This never happen in intellij or inserting data in excel or other basic ide. Please do you know a plugin can save me from that, if things keep going as that I have to renounce to use org mode for important info, and I do not want that.

 optionally:
 you can try out gccemacs which has native compilation 
 if you are on any linux distro
 ​
 https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GccEmacs
 ​
 General advice:
 ​
 set the value of gcmh-high-cons-threshold to a suitable value of
 your choice do not set it to very high values as it will
 not have any performance gains acorrding to the below post.
 minimum value if you are an lsp user "100000000".
 ​
 https://bling.github.io/blog/2016/01/18/why-are-you-changing-gc-cons-threshold/
 ​
 Also do not set the value of gc-cons-threshold value in lsp package
 :config option as this value is set automatically by gcmh package
 ​
 never turn your back again to emacs. emacs is awesome!!! :)
 ​
 NOTE:
 ​
 The above post is not to cause fights or to raise any political agendas.
 This is just an opinion and help by myside to any user struggling with
 emacs performance issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had originally posted this on r/spacemacs, but someone mentioned that it might be better addressed here. Thanks in advance for any thoughts!
 ***
 I've been using Spacemacs for a month or so and am really enjoying the experience. I originally wanted to learn Emacs because of Org-Mode, but have since started doing most of my writing in a markdown buffer using writeroom-mode, where I previously just wrote with Vim in a terminal.
 I'm using a standard US keyboard on a 2013 Macbook Pro (still going strong), but I use ä ü ö ß all the time. The situation is basically exactly what is outlined in this older post. I have had the same key combinations baked into my fingers for years and I'd like to keep it that way. Right now, I have this in my user-config:
 (setq ns-alternate-modifier 'none
 ns-right-alternate-modifier 'meta)
 It works wonderfully, all good, I thought. But now at some point the umlauts go haywire: for example, ä eventually becomes \303\244 and I'm not sure what could be triggering the change or how to fix it. I get that it's UTF-8, but why it ends up like that in the first place is beyond me. Is there an obvious fix here or something that I'm missing? Thanks in advance for any input.
 UPDATE: 
 The link that u/graduale posted ended up being super helpful, as it was indeed some sort of encoding issue having something to do with the existence of the "null-bytes" as discussed in that thread. Found them with C-s C-q C-SPC, got rid of them and using revert-buffer-with-coding-system cleaned everything up after I selected the encoding. And the change seems to be holding after restarting emacs completely as well. Thanks for the help!

 Setting it to nil makes vterm as snappy as any other external emulators I've used.
 Does anybody know why it's set to 0.1 by default? Prevent performance issues?

 For example, given an org-mode table like this:
 |-----+-----+-----| | Foo | Bar | Baz | |-----+-----+-----| | Y | N | abc | | N | Y | def | | Y | N | ghi | |-----+-----+-----| 
 I'd like to count how many "Y" are in each column, to create this result:
 |-----+-----+-----| | Foo | Bar | Baz | |-----+-----+-----| | Y | N | abc | | N | Y | def | | Y | N | ghi | |-----+-----+-----| | 2 | 1 | 0 | |-----+-----+-----| 
 As a bonus, it'd be nice to be able to determine what percentage of the total number of lines in the table (excluding the header, result lines, and separators) contain "Y", resulting in:
 |-----+-----+-----| | Foo | Bar | Baz | |-----+-----+-----| | Y | N | abc | | N | Y | def | | Y | N | ghi | |-----+-----+-----| | 2 | 1 | 0 | | 67 | 33 | 0 | |-----+-----+-----| 
 Of course, this should work with any number of rows and columns.

 Here is another post for an unofficial Copilot plugin named flight-attendant.el. It seems no longer maintained, so I wrote a new one, additionally supporting up-to-date Copilot client, accepting completion and better integration with company-mode.
 The plugin is still under development, and I only tested its compatibility under Linux + Spacemacs.
 Since it's my very first elisp project, any tips or advice are welcome, thank you!

 Hey all,
 flymake-swi-prolog is an Emacs package implementing a simple Flymake backend for SWI-Prolog, it provides diagnostics about Prolog source code in prolog-mode buffers.
 Here's how it may look when you write some code that makes no sense:
 flymake-swi-prolog
 This is the first Emacs package I've authored, I use Emacs a lot but I haven't written a lot of Elisp outside of my config file before, so the implementation is mostly based on the example backend from the Flymake manual. Any comments or suggestions are welcome!
 Under the hood, flymake-swi-prolog uses diagnostics.pl, which is a tiny Prolog package I've written to expose the diagnosis performed by the SWI-Prolog built-in IDE in a way that is both human-readable and easy enough for me to consume from Elisp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Zettlers,
does anyone speak (write and read) Sanskrit? If yes, how does it feel compared to English or other languages you speak?
I am asking because I think about learning Sanskrit to improve my thinking.
Example: To me, German is very sensitive compared to English. In German, tiny differences in wording make a huge difference in meaning and tone. English is much more simple.
A (translated) quote that is very telling:

  
French is a noble park, Italian a big, bright and colourful wood. But German is more like a primeval forest, as thick and mysterious, as lacking big trails and yet full of hidden paths. You can’t get lost in a park, and not that easily and dangerously in the Italian wood’s brightness; but in German can disappear in the thicket within four, five minutes. Because the paths are so difficult to follow, most try to march as straight as possible through it. Actually, this is against it’s against the nature of this language. Sure, it has a principal direction, but yet invites by hundred trails and hidden paths left and right to depart from it, and soon back to it.



I butchered the quote through translation because it makes heavy use of the peculiarities of the German language.
That is the reason why translations from German into English are very difficult.
That is the reason why I plan to provide my own translation of the core texts of Luhmann in some distant future.
Live long and prosper

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, in an endeavor to truly understand the difference between a REPL and an interactive shell, I've came across this article On Repl-Driven Programming (hackernews comments). The author described two important features that Lisp REPLs have and other languages such as Python/Ruby lack. These two features are:
  
breakloop. If you call an undefined function, the debugger will be in a breakloop (what the L in REPL truly stands for), and in there you can edit the code, without restarting the function call. In emacs if would of be like if we encounter a (void-variable foo) error and the debugger pops up. And then we recursively edit the source code and then the debugger will go back one step in the stack and the code runs like no error has happened.
 
hot reloading. If you define a class, and instantiate a few instances, changing the class definition while the program is running will dynamic be reflected on the instances without restarting the REPL. In emacs, I feel like the main emacs runtime already has some of this using eval-defun or eval-sexp, but it's not as automatic as other languages mentioned. 
 
  
My questions are: 
 Do we have breakloop and hot reloading in Emacs? Are there any other tricks that Emacs has for REPL-driven development? 
 Thanks!

But it's not always obvious to me.
Most recently someone was asking a very specific question about searching, and it was clear that they were using a specific package, but it wasn't at all obvious to me what package it was.  I spent several seconds in confusion, trying to work it out. (It was, apparently, a thing called "The Archive", which I've never seen.)
So ...
What software are you using?
What do you particularly like about it?
What features do other people talk about that you wish you had?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had to move my developing of Haskell code from a system that I did not maintain myself, to my own laptop. The thing is: on the old system whoever set that thing up made it so that all Haskell libraries were available. I could just include them and run ghci and it would run without a hassle and I could do this without fiddling around with Cabal. Just compile and run any file without bothering about project configs and whatever.
 Since moving to my laptop and trying to do the same here, I consistently get messages about missing modules.
 Example:
 "Could not find module ‘Control.Monad.Par’"
 I've tried reading about how to do it, but introductory guides to Cabal all talk about setting up project stuff, which was not at all necessary on the old system. On the old system I could create a .hs file wherever I wanted and compile it with ghc/ghci easily. I did not need to set up Cabal projects to do it.

 VSCode has such a page, here it is: https://vscodecandothat.com

 Having animgif demos is important, because then the user can instantly see the value of a feature without installing and configuring it first.
 Such a page could be shown to new users, so they can browse it and find useful packages which they may not find otherwise for a long time.
 The community could create a page like this by people contributing animgifs demoing their favorite features and collecting these on a webpage.

In most posts that I see about this, a person that's usually fairly new to org-mode will lament org-mode's default flat-ish method of archiving, in which the original parent tree context is set as a property. Then discussion about how to do it that way, either through a function or through project management (only archive once the project is closed out), separate files per project, etc.
 What I'd like to know is who among you prefers the default flat-ish method for archiving, and how does that work for you? How do you resolve the typical objections to that method, which drives people to seek out a tree-mimicking approach?

 I am trying to write a sort of repl for a hex editor. The work of the hex editor is irrelevent. I have some functions all of them return an Either String (String, Core) where Core contains information about the current state of the program. In order to execute those functions, I store the functions and the commands that correspond to them in a Map String (String -> Either String (String, Core)) but this doesn't work that well because the user may want to load a file into the program meaning that some functions may be IOs so what would be a better way to do what I want (without having to make everything IO)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following class:
 class Entity a id where getId :: a -> id 
 I use this class to represent data that have an identity, so for example:
 data Person = Person { id :: Int, name :: String } instance Entity Person Int where getId = Person.id 
 This instance allows me to compare Persons even if they changed their name. What I have noticed is that in several places in my code, I'm repeating the same comparison:
 (getId personInThePast) == (getId samePerson) 
 It would be great if I could write the following:
 personInThePast === samePerson 
 The idea would be that the compiler would know it should just compare their IDs. I can make an Eq instance of Person, but if I follow that path, I would repeat the same code for all my Entity. Since I know how to equate any Entity, I thought that I could write an Eq instance for my Entity class, but the compiler complains that Entity is a constraint, so now I don't know how to implement this. Any help?

 I use this to include long code block, it has its own file outside of org mode. For short codes, I tried to use org babel. I want this org babel, when exported, to have the same listing style as above, when you include from outside. This answer suggests doing:
 #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{listings} #+LATEX_HEADER: \lstdefinestyle{BashInputStyle}{language=bash,basicstyle=\large\ttfamily, numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,numbersep=3pt,frame=tb} Normal include code from outside #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex \lstinputlisting[language=Python,style=BashInputstyle]{hello.py} #+END_EXPORT Now org babel block #+ATTR_LATEX: :options style=BashInputStyle #+BEGIN_SRC bash echo "hello world" #+END_SRC 
 I tried and got error, in fact it rendered incorrectly. This is my log and resulting tex file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am trying to build a parser to parse command line arguments of the following form.
 ​
 -verbose -leftString STRING -rightString STRING 
 Two of the arguments take a parameter of type String. If some of them i snot specified, I have default values for them (in my structure Arguments {verbose :: Bool, leftString :: Maybe String, rightString :: Maybe String}I would use False, Nothing, Nothing.
 However, the flag (the argument) can be specified more then once, in which case the last flag is decisive (i.e. "./program -leftString foo -leftString bar" would become Arguments False "bar" Nothing after parsing).
 ​
 I know, how to do a parser for each of these options returning Parser Bool (or Parser String, respectively). But how do I make them run repeatedly until all of them fail (the arguments do not need to be in any particular order, so I have to try all of them for each argument). I could achieve that by using something like many $ choice [...], but that doesn't let me to gradually update the parsed values (if more flags, only last flag value is kept).
 ​
 Or, I could use something like optional in sequence where I set the default value to the last parsed (or the default one if no parsed value yet). But optional always succeeds and I would never know if this is the last time I succeeded and I should stop parsing.
 ​
 What can I do?

 ​
 i tried to write an parser and an interpreter for System F Omega in Haskell. My goal is not to write the Functions for Substitution myself but use Haskell Functions , but I don't know if that is possible.
 I've seen this Code in my FP-Lecture an I would also like to write an interpreter that is safe and easy and doesn't needs much Code.

 This Emacs configuration aims to be uncluttered, clean, vanilla, and practically useful for any day-to-day tasks.
 It only has the absolute necessary configurations, tailored to be minimal w/ vanilla keybindings, practical and useful. It is easy to add any additional feature and package later if you need one.
 There are several reasons for keeping the configuration to a bare minimum, one is that it’s easier to keep track of all the packages and keystrokes. It is better to have a setup that you use 90% of the time, than having a cluttered setup that will just make it difficult to keep up with gazillions of preinstalled packages that usually end-up being unused.
 This configuration tries not to be a one-size-fits all configuration, but it tries to be an Emacs configuration that suits most of the developers, and I keep it personable, clean, easy and sensible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What Happened
On the morning of the 22nd of March, 2022, we were notified about the
existence of an unknown critical vulnerability on one of Minswap’s
contracts. Everyone here on the audit team was dismayed, since we had
conducted an audit for Minswap not long before. We found 3 critical
issues that would have likewise enabled an attacker to empty the
reserves, and 13 issues in total, but failed to find this one.

How It Happened
The heart of the vulnerability lies in this seemingly harmless
function which checks that a given value possesses a single unit of an
asset class:
isUnity :: Value -> AssetClass -> Bool
isUnity v c = assetClassValueOf v c == 1

While harmless in isolation, in the context it was used isUnity
revealed itself to be disastrous:

GNU Emacs 27.2 
 Manjaro Linux 21.2.5 (codename: Qonos)
 Doom core v3.0.0-dev
 Doom modules v22.03.0-dev
 Ivy Version: 0.13.4
  
Issue*: 
 Some manpages do not show up when I run M-x man. Apparently, this only happens with non-default packages which I installed manual with pacman, probably with whatever I install from the aur as well, but I didn't test it. 
 For example, on the command line,$ man yt-dlp shows me the correct manpage, while on Emacs M-x man followed by yt-dlp does not list its corresponding manpage. 
 $ whereis yt-dlp show that yt-dlp manpage is at the correct location: yt-dlp: /usr/bin/yt-dlp /usr/share/man/man1/yt-dlp.1.gz. 
 The issue occurs with ivy-mode disabled as well.
 Posting here first instead of /r/doom because I figure this might be a system vs Emacs thing, and not a Doom thing...

 I installed php-mode and when I open a php file I see that my php file is almost NOT highlighted. Variables, class names, strings, method calls are not really distinguished among each other. 
 Is it how it's intended? If not, do you have any hints on how I can debug this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I use Emacs to write documentation, and a lot of times my files end up with some internal markup that looks like this: [TK: Where is the event handler defined?] in-line with the text. ("TK" is writer speak for "to come"), since the only common English words that have 'tk' in them are "pocketknife" and "hotkey", and case sensitivity matters.)
 I added "TK" to hl-todo-keyword-faces, but I discovered that hl-todo uses a regexp like (^|\s)(<keyword>), so the opening bracket confuses hl-todo and it doesn't show up in the todo lists.
 I wrote a quick perl script to place a space before the bracket, and it worked, and now the magit-status buffer says my documentation folder has 59 TODOs over 41 markdown files-- which is great!-- but it won't list them! Which is not great.
 So:
  
Remembering to include the space in [ TK: ...] is a pain in the neck, and looks terrible. Is there a way to modify the regexp such that the opening bracket is a legal character to hl-todo without hacking hl-todo's source in the elpa folder?
 
Has anyone seen this where Magit-todo won't list the TODOs? What do I do? I'm not the world's greatest elisp hacker, and it's always good to task first before trying to figure out for myself.
 
 Thanks it advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm trying to accomplish some SVG drawing with Haskell. Any language, really, but my go to is Haskell. I'm not really opposed to another language if anyone has a really great library in another language but that's perhaps off topic. I'm having trouble finding a library that really does everything I want.
 What I'm trying to do is draw a series of SVGs that are all varied but similar in many ways. So code sharing is important, which is why I can't do this in SVG and I need a programming language to generate them. I need to load in SVGs that I'm using from other sources as icons and also fonts and things like that.
 This is what I've looked into and found.
 svg-tree seems to be the library with the ability to read in SVG files and parse them into internal docs to manipulate.
 lucid-svg, which is recommended by svg-tree for doing actual drawing, doesn't seem to have this, but is much better for providing a drawing API, which I'll be using a lot of.
 svg-builder is very similar to lucid-svg, same up sides, a bit of an annoying use of hard to read operators for the attributes instead of just using tuples and lists, in my opinion, but fine, no reader still though.
 blaze-svg seems to not have any parser either, have much less documentation, and have a less nice API for drawing.
 I don't think the svg-tree data types are compatible with lucid-svg, but that'd be nice if they were based on each other.
 Does anyone know of a good setup for what I'm trying to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a dissertation with org-mode. Each chapter lives in its own org file. I also have an outline.org file which holds the outline of all the chapters. Basically, I'm wondering whether it's possible to use #+INCLUDE to only import the headers from each file (and none of its content), so that my outline.org file can be updated automatically. This seems like it should be possible, but I haven't been able to figure it out. Any help would be appreciated.

 I had to use vscode/intellij and want to back to emacs. basically all I need is ok exept the multiple cursor select and moves that I miss a lot.
 I want to add up or down multiple cursor from where my cursor is and from that add text or have the availbility to put all the cursor to end of line with ctrl+e. 
 here is a example in video
 I tried C-x SPC but selectio nis a bit lilmited from where I start and to add text to EOL, string-regex is like too restrictive or complicated just to add some text with return etc...
 any idea on how to do that?

 Dear all,
 There were several people who came to the last meetup looking for information about debugging Org mode. The last meetup was rather unhelpful in this regard since we dove into a specific use-case.
 I plan to try once more providing a more general introduction to Org (and Emacs) debugging. Tentatively, I plan to talk about: 1. Running Emacs with clean configuration + latest version of Org 2. Bisecting config to find configuration-related issues 3. Using Emacs profiler and sharing profiler results 4. Answer any questions on the first three topics
 After the introduction, we can continue with interactive debugging if there is anyone experiencing performance (or other) issues with Org and willing to share screen.
 Note that using microphone and/or camera should not be required. Jitsi does have chat.
 The time will be the same: 9pm SG time (4pm Moscow; 8am New York; 1pm London). Sat, Mar 26
 I will post the link to the meeting one hour before the meeting start.

 The first begin_example part defines an input text file containing test cases.
 I want to redirect this content into stdin of the second begin_src python part, so that the input() function in the code would read the content.
 How can I do this? Are there any options for this? I've searched about this but failed to find one... Please help me!

 Is this behaviour familiar to anyone?
 I managed to fix the navigation problem by getting rid of evil-respect-visual-line-mode and instead doing the following (source):
 (define-key evil-motion-state-map [remap evil-next-line] #'evil-next-visual-line) 
 (define-key evil-motion-state-map [remap evil-previous-line] #'evil-previous-visual-line)
 But this only works on navigation, not on yanking, deleting, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an emacsian newbie and also with ADHD, I have many tasks which remind me to do daily/weekly/etc. things, jog my memory (poor man's Anki), etc. And I sometimes treat or think about my repeated tasks differently than my one-off tasks. In order to differentiate them in Agenda, I have adopted a policy of appending their repetition amount in the headline itself, like this:
 *** TODO Clean/Organize Garage for 10 minutes .+1w SCHEDULED: <2022-03-19 Sat .+1w> Spend at least 10 minutes cleaning up the garage. (I'll probably do more, but 10 min minimum.) 
 This makes it clear to me that this is a repeated task. So for example, if the above case is overdue by 3 days, I might just CANCEL the task to get it out of my hair, and let it roll forward to next Sat. But I wouldn't want to CANCEL a one-off task. I'll let it sit in my Agenda or reschedule it. 
 Do you do something similar? Or is there a more emacsian way to do this? I do use org habits for some things, and they are obviously not an issue because they are clearly differentiated from one-off tasks. I like my system, but it's sort of an anti-pattern since it's not automated or checked. So I'd like to know how others deal with this kind of differentiation and interaction with Agenda.

 copy and yank the other tree to the new buffer
 do a M-x ediff-current-file or diff-buffer-with-file. 
 resolve differences in the main org file

 Quarto® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc
  
Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.
 Author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks.
 Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
 Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.
  
See Quatro gallery to have a quick look at its potential.
 Don't get me wrong, I'm convinced that org-mode is more powerful and features rich, but the integration made here with Quarto is to me a good example of a powerful and sleek integration of Pandoc and its ecosystem. 
 I still have this feeling that org-mode suffers from a visibility issue, most likely associated with the fact that it's only pegged to Emacs (although serious cloning attempts exist: orgmode.nvim or neorg/).
 I find the orgdown initiative very interesting in the sense of opening up org to something other than our beloved Emacs.
 What do you think ? Can we dream of access to org-mode as simple and complete as Quarto for example while benefiting from the same "universality"/popularity of the markdown format, is this vision realistic, attainable ?
 Have fun.

 I haven't seen this example but is it possible to pass a Haskell function to C with the type

 I suspect that directly passing a function on lists is not possible. What about functions on storable vectors?
 myfunc :: SV.Vector Double -> SV.Vector Double ?
 From what I've seen, transforming Haskell functions for C is handled by a "wrapper" function, I'm not sure what the limits of this conversion are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been writing a simple GUI app using reactive-banana, and I've run into a problem. The GUI displays one of two meshes: mesh A or mesh B; the user can switch between them by clicking a checkbox. My event network looks like this:
 ---checkbox---+ | -------A------+---AorB---+ | | -------B------+ +---mesh--- | --------drawParams-------+ 
 The problem is that every time I click the checkbox, the mesh now being visualized (either A or B) is regenerated, which takes quite a while. The event network doesn't trigger it -- changes A shows no activity -- but a trace in the (pure) generation function shows that the mesh being activated is being regenerated.
 (It used to be worse; before switching with switchB, I was generating AorB with, essentially, liftA3 ifThenElse, which made both of the meshes regenerate every time the checkbox was clicked!)
 I note, however, that merely changing the draw parameters does not result in a rebuilding of the mesh; apparently the value of AorB is cached in some way. Is there a way in reactive-banana to request this behaviour; that is, to tell it to cache the value of some Behavior so it doesn't have to recompute it when using it further down the network? Failing that, is there some simple way to do the caching myself? (I can just about see how to do it using IORefs and something like imposeChanges, but a simpler way would be better.)

 I would like to keep my cursor always in the middle of the screen, even if I'm writing at the bottom of a buffer. I added the following snippet to my init.el
 (use-package centered-cursor-mode :ensure t :init (global-centered-cursor-mode 1) ) (setq scroll-margin 28) ;; full screen = 57 lines (setq-default indicate-empty-lines t) 
 but it doesn't work and the cursor is only around 25% of the buffer. see here : https://imgur.com/3glkqEa.png
 (also I assume I should set a hook because I don't want to loose 50% of screen space for terminal type buffers)
 Thanks,

Here are some excerpts from his book Between Two Worlds: Memoirs of a Philosopher-Scientist (Springer-Verlag, 2016) about his use of card-boxes and about the alleged exploits of a card-pilferer. One guesses from these glimpses that Bunge's card-system was not as developed as Luhmann's, which is no discredit to Bunge's achievements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am trying to wrap my head around the Profunctor typeclasses.
 Notably, I am trying to find out why there isn't a lot of code around using something like Monoidal/ProductProfuctor and instead there seems to have been a decision to go for Traversing and similar typeclasses.
 I have been looking mostly at this discussion from a couple of years ago that has the following:
  
davemenendez says that you can implement wander using the Monoidal typeclass (which, as far as I can tell, is only true if your profunctor is representable?)
 ekmett says that Monoidal is implemented via Traversing in the profunctors lib (which doesn't make sense to me, because I don't see how one can write one in terms of the other)
  
There's the glassery blog post from Oleg that also mentions Monoidal, but with disappointment because it doesn't bring much on top of Choice, if I understand correctly (but I don't see e.g. Costar mentioned in the table where this conclusion is reached).
 I have spent a couple of hours trying to implement Monoidal in terms of Traversing and vice-versa and gone nowhere unless I also bring Representable to the table, but there are some good examples for non-representable instances of Monoidal so I don't want to do this.
 Either I am missing some cool trick in my bag of tricks or I really don't understand what's happening here.
 Anyone got some illuminating text or notes or something?

 I have recently learned Haskell and have written some code but I feel like I am just writing pure functions in a procedural and I am not taking advantage of the abstractions offered by Haskell. It is not that I don't know about these abstractions it is because I don't think about them when I am writing code so my question is do you have any suggestions on how to actually write code that takes complete advantage of Haskell's awesomeness? Feel free to point me to any book/articles/videos that talk about this subject. Thanks!

 (defmacro print-first (first) "Print FIRST name." `(message ,first)) (defmacro print-full (first last) "Print FIRST and LAST name." `(message ,(concat first " " last))) (defun make-pet (first-name last-name) "Create a pet using FIRST-NAME and LAST-NAME." (make-record 'pet 1 `(first-name last-name (print-first first-name) (print-full first-name last-name)))) 
 Basically I want a user to be able to define a pet, and my library should be able to generate functions for that pet. In my actual library, some of these functions modify the properties of the pet itself not shown here. Is what I have shown here the best way to do this? Should I be using make-record?
 Also, are there any tips for testing macros? I am reading about how when they are compiled and ran that they behave differently than when evaluated and ran.

The Precursor is the latest open source hardware project from OSHW wizard Andrew "bunnie" Huang – AKA "the guy who broke the Xbox DRM and is now suing to overturn the DMCA."
 https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5921
 It's a mobile hardware platform, "a framework upon which you can assemble a wide variety of DIY mobile applications…designed from the ground-up to be carried around in your pocket."
 "It’s not just a naked circuit board with connectors hanging off at random locations: it comes fully integrated—with a rechargeable battery, a display, and a keyboard—in a sleek, 7.2 mm (quarter-inch) aluminum case."
 The design is derived from the Betrusted project, an ambitious open source hardware privacyphone initiative that is super cool, but still has a long way to go before it's ready for field use.
  
 After digging through the docs, it looks like it uses a Rust-based OS called Xous 
 https://xobs.io/announcing-xous-the-betrusted-operating-system/
 Given that this is a BW graphics device with a hardware keyboard, long battery life, wifi, and fits into your pocket -- this might be the ideal mobile emacs device.
  
I'm not sure if Emacs will compile on it, and there's no X11 or Wayland to speak of, so there will be some roadbumps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! Org-mode user since a few years and I recently started clocking my tasks. I have seen that I get different date-time formats and also different editing behavior. This probably has a good name (or keyword) that I could google but I don't know what what would be.
 First, date-time format can come in (at least) two different "flavors" and I don't know what the difference is.
 First one is with [] used as block characters
 CLOCK: [2022-03-21 Mon 11:51]--[2022-03-21 Mon 12:36] => 0:45 
 Second is the same but with <> used as block characters
 CLOCK: <2022-03-21 Mon 11:51>--<2022-03-21 Mon 12:36> => 0:45 
 I can change between these two different style by putting my cursor on the brackets (either type) and then use S-UP/DOWN to change between them.

 I use Arch, and i3wm. My version of emacs is 27.2

 I mainly use emacs for org mode and some light coding. I do use vim bindings. I'm on a mac
 With Doom I feel like there is a lot of extra stuff that I don't need or understand. I like the idea of building something from scratch that is leaner and fits my needs. Also, if I have a question, it's hard to know if it's a doom thing or an emacs thing. I would just learn emacs
 Does that make sense high level? Would it be a crazy amount of work to configure it to what I use emacs for now? I'm willing to do some work to get to a good place, but don't want to be stuck fiddling with it forever either. Is there somewhere that would be good to start from?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I have been working on a simple threading / pipeline library for emacs largely based off a cl library with the same name. For those who don't know what that means its basically a way to make deeply nested code into something much easier to read. It can be thought of as analogous to a unix pipe.
 (some (code (that (is (deeply (nested)))))) ;; turns into (arr-> (nested) (deeply) (is) (that) (code) (some)) 
 where the result of the last result is passed in as the first argument of the next.
 There are other variants for different use cases, whether you need to pass it in as the last argument or even if you need arbitrary placements, all can currently be achieved. This is not the end though as there are plans to aggregate a bunch of arrows from different languages, not because its necessarily practical but because its fun!
 here is the github page for it, if people want to use it, if its useful to people ill also post it to (m)elpa
 Feedback and PR's are as always appreciated.

2022 Week 12
Last Week
Onboarding and refactoring "Paul, Annie Murphy. The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2021." My experience working in my ZK with the notes from reading Annie Paul's book was basso-profundo. The ideas resonated, and it was easy to rewrite the highlights with my understanding and find relevant links to what was already in my ZK.
Reading "Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson."
This Week
More reading and onboarding "Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson."
I'm most excited about the development of a proximity search tool! While refactoring and deep linking "The Extended Mind," the near_search.py proved itself. It quickly surfaced surprisingly relevant link candidates that would have taken lots of time and frustration to find.
I want to start on a short video presentation on using citations with The Archive integrating Zotero and Pandoc for perfect Markdown to PDF or Word documents. You can easily cite using any style (CMOS, MLA, APA, IEEE, or whatever) and have the final document outputted in any format you need.
Trivia. These are the last ten notes I've created. Show me yours!

Note identifiers are avoided altogether in favor of descriptive filenames. This obviates the timestamp versus Folgezettel question. A tradeoff is that note filenames should be unique and should be considered immutable: a title cannot be changed without changing each reference to the note with that title. This seems like a minor inconvenience, in view of the use of backlinks to create indexes and hubs, below.


Bibliographic entries (literature notes) are separate notes that link to a note titled Bibliography.  The choice of writing bibliographic entries within Obsidian (the slip box component of the Zettelkasten) seems less efficient than working with a reference manager such…]]></summary>

 Say you have the same 10 lines of text in a dozen different files. Is there a way to update all instances of that text at once? Can you link to a file but have the description just be the contents of the file that's linked?

 How can I configure TCP keep alive parameters per-socket, specifically TCP_KEEPCNT, TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL? This is based on this doc for context.
 network library exposes SO_KEEPALIVE parameter that as I understand enables/disables it, but not the three parameters above? Even with that parameter, when I print its value after setting it to 1 in the client I get 64 and in the server I get 8 – so I am not sure if I am setting it correctly...
 There is also keep-alive library that seems to allow configuring TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL per socket, but it doesn't compile on Mac.
 I would really appreciate any suggestions here - thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently writing an article in org-mode and use org-cite for my citation needs. I export via LaTeX and have everything working as expected, using biblatex-apa in the background.
 Following APA guidelines, I need to produce a few citations with a prefix that ends in a semicolon, e.g., "... (here is the prefix; Author, 2022)." Unfortunately I can't get this to work since the semicolon is used as a delimiter of citations in org-cite (cf. here). Thus I can produce "... (here is the prefix, Author, 2022)" with [cite:here is the prefix, @author2022], but [cite:here is the prefix; @author2022] doesn't work.
 As a workaround, I could use LaTeX code (e.g., \autocite[here is the prefix;][]{author2022}) which yields the correct result when used in LaTeX directly. The problem is that the prefixes are mostly acronyms, which I like to put in small capitals, and exporting \autocite[\textsc{abc};][]{author2022} to LaTeX for somehow doesn't work (it gets converted to \autocite[\textsc{abc};][]\{author2022\}).
 How can I produce the citation with a prefix that ends in a semicolon? This should be simple, but I can't find a solution and it is driving me mad. Any help is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm a mentor for FIRST Robotics Competition. I want to transition my team of novice high-school students from Java.
 EDIT: I shouldn't have assumed that people would just be familiar with FIRST... I've had a few questions asking exactly what I my use case is. Essentially, students are given 8 weeks to build a robot for a competition. We aren't told the rules in advance, so everyone has the same 8 week period to design, build, and program the robot.
 However, off-season teams tend to do things like write general purpose code (e.g., movement) or streamline processes, make practice robots, etc.
 The library used in the competition (optional; teams can also create low level code from scratch, but almost nobody does) is called WPILIB. It's primarily a Java and C++ framework, which you can read about here.
 I recently became an F# evangelist and found that functional programming has greatly reduced the fragility of my code by way of ensuring a correct data model.
 I am looking to move our team to possibly using Spring and definitely using Scala or Kotlin.
 One of my fellow mentors has suggested that object oriented design is easier to reason with in the case of a robot, and suggested Kotlin as our next language.
 I suggested that functional programming can definitely be used to model a Robotics systems and ensure that invalid states are explicitly rejected while making the program easier to debug and test.
 Regardless of which language we pick, everyone will be learning it (and Spring) from scratch. 
 What are your thoughts? Which language will better suit what we're trying to do?
 EDIT 2: We have decided on Kotlin for the main application code for now, but if Scala makes more sense for certain use cases (e.g., programming autonomous mode functions) we will be open to writing those modules in Scala. I still welcome any discussions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that this might come across as rude, and I apologise in advance if it does, but is anyone able to give me some rationale for why the Yesod forms API is the way it is? It seems to me to be incredibly overcomplicated. There's a mess of boilerplate, what with creating a data type and generating a widget from it, even if you need all of two fields, as in the case of a login form. In particular, controlling the layout and appearance of the form seems to be extremely cumbersome. The applicative API seems basically useless, given that you don't have any control over appearance - as soon as you want to do something as simple as tweak the label font size you have to drop to the monadic API.
 I'm coming from Flask here, so my reference point that you just write your form in a jinja2 template, in which you have full and straightforward control over the form's layout and appearance, then you access the form data from a request like so:
 ``` @app.route("/login", methods=("GET", "POST")) def login(): """Log in a registered user by adding the user id to the session.""" if request.method == "POST": username = request.form["username"] password = request.form["password"]
  # do things with username and password 
 ```
 Why not have something similar in Yesod, simply write the form as a Hamlet widget, and access the form data by name, instead of all this stuff with creating a datatype and generating the widget from it using generateFormPost and runFormPost? I'm new to Yesod, so I understand I'm probably missing a lot of information. But I don't think I require much expertise to state that I'm finding the API pretty unpleasant to use.

 The issue is this: when I run git commit it launches a new frame in my terminal, as you'd expect. The issue arises if I choose to cancel my commit using C-c C-k. Canceling the commit returns me to my terminal hanging on the git message "Hint: waiting for your editor to close the file...". It hangs until I take some other action on my system (taking an action such as spawning a new terminal, opening a new emacsclient, etc).
 If you have any ideas on what may be causing this, or I how I can provide more information, please let me know.

When you get back to your session, you forget that you cut out that large chunk, but it's not obvious that it's missing.

 ODE's solved in this way start with an initial condition and are solved by advancing by a time-step (if time is the relevant parameter) based on the current state. This is nicely solved using the iterate function. 
 I was initially planning on switching to a vector type or similar, but maybe that is not necessary?
 Any thoughts on if it's worth trying different container types?

Initially, running mbsync -aV would just download all emails from the remote. While this wasn't a problem for my work email (a relatively new mailbox), I suspect this would be of a greater issue for my personal gmail as I have thousands of useless/spam/marketing emails which just eats up space. Given the download rate limit from gmail (2.5GB per day) and my limited local drive space, I was wondering if there is any setup in mbsync to only download N number of recent emails, or download emails after a specific year. (I could, alternatively, just cleanup my gmail inbox. Maybe that will be the last option!)

 However, I can't seem to find anything that goes beyond the introductory level when it comes to concurrency stuff.
 I want to understand how threads work, what exactly a ExecutionContext does, what the heck is a Semaphore and a IORef?
 Is there anything that teaches me, from the very beginning, threads? Perhaps not why they exist (I know that), but what are their consequences, and how do we go about alleviating those consequences?
 The only extensive resource I could find is the book "Java Threads", which seems to be outdated, but I could be wrong.
 How did you learn all that stuff? Thanks.

 I thought the same. However, it's such a complex graph of dependencies involving type families and similar that I gave up after 20 minutes of trying to add deriving instances for some types and finding workarounds for others where that's not possible.
 There's also the excellent recover-rtti library and its anythingToString function, but I couldn't use it here since it wasn't compatible with the version of GHC I was using.

 https://corwin.bru.st/emacs-28
 In addition to what gets posted to the alpha FTP site, the scripts make and upload "NATIVE_FULL_AOT" versions (from the emacs-28 and master branches, currently).
 If you aren't familiar, passing NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1 to make triggers full ahead-of-time native elisp compilation. In the case of Windows builds, this means the build will include DLLs for most/all elisp sources distributed with Emacs. These DLLs can be used without additional pre-requisites apart from what is included in emacs-<version>.zip (or emacs-<version>-installer.exe). This is useful when you can't --don't want-- to put GCC/libgccjit on a Windows system where you use Emacs.
 Thanks much for all of the help testing out the builds I've been making and in advance for your feedback on the AOT versions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Haskell all the Comonads (at least the ones defined in the comonads package) are duals of transformers Monad Transformers. This is taken by changing the occurrence of the “state parameter” from positive to negative occurrence ((,) s <-> (->) s). 
 For example (in pseudocode)
 —- m is Monad, w is Comonad —- Writer and Co-writer WriterT s m a ~ m ((,) s a) TracedT s w a ~ w ((->) s a) —- Reader and Co-reader ReaderT s m a ~ (->) s (m a) EnvT s w a ~ (,) s (w a) —- State and Co-State StateT s m a ~ (->) s (m ((,) s a)) StoreT s w a ~ (,) s (w ((->) s a)) 
 However this is also a pretty restricted notion of duality. I wanted to know if there is a more intuition as to why this is the case, and then to what the dual of something like MaybeT, SelectT, and ContT (or is there?). Or why (->) and (,) are duals (because one is the exponential, and the other is the product); why aren’t the duals Either and (,)?
 MaybeT m a ~ m (Maybe a) ~ m (1 + a) CoMaybeT w a ~ w (Void, a) ~ w (0 * a) —- Note that CoMaybeT is uninhabited when w is a Comonad

 I can't find any scala related error by searching.
 I have the following error.
 ```
 there were 2 deprecation warning(s); re-run with -deprecation for details
 ```
 I search "re-run with -deprecation for details scala" on internet. nothing comes up. 
 ​
 I have no clue how to figure out where the error come from. 
 I can't seem to find anything related to scala by searching google. 
 For example, converting number base like from base 2 to base 10.
 ​
 I am reading a book on scala right now, so if I have encounter the material in the book before, I may be lucky and find answer there.
 ​
 I also search scala api document. 
 ​
 How can I search for error related to scala language? 
 I can't seem to find anything by searching google, search from books, search scala api.
 What am I missing?

 and
  <#/part><#/multipart> -------------------- End of forwarded message -------------------- 
 It it unclear to me where I should include my message to the forwarded email. I tried adding it before and after this text, but my text does not actually show up on all email clients of my recipients (for example Gmail).
 This style of forwarding is different from what I am used. I came from mu4e and other email clients where an email is usually quoted (as it would have been for a reply) and then I usually top-post my additional message.
 How do I correctly forward a message in notmuch? Is there a way to have a more "traditional" forwarding format which uses the same format as when replying (with a different message subject)?

 It seems that this is a mode is "global" and there is no way to restrict this mode to python buffers only. I don't understand the details but somebody explained it here on emacs.stackexchange.
 So the question is if there is another package or solution to have something like this (prefered in the headline) but in Python buffers only.
 I read about some lsp-mode depended solutions. The problem here is that I use eglot instead of lsp-mode and won't change that.

 I think it should be possible to integrate the spelling completions into Vertico - I know that Doom Emacs does this. Does anyone know how to set this up correctly? I was recommended the "spell-correct" package, but I can't find it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In short - Decades with Emacs but have only used org for recording notes, snippets, ideas.. never for tasks. Okay writing elisp just always used a simple checklists in whatever pocketable devices I had at the time. Random youtubes or org-mode pages tends to show simple agenda view but what I _think_ I'm looking for is more complex and I'm not sure org-agenda/etc can do it as is? (Presumably there are org query APIs I could hijack and make my own major mode viewer, but trying to reduce TODOs not add more ;)
 With hundreds of to-dos, perhaps org-mode/agenda/whatever can save me? The rate of adding to-dos exceeds the rate of completing them sadly :)
 Ideally plainorg or beorg can render it as well.
 Current Workflow:
 - many are dated to-do's - the date by which I'd like to see them
 - many are undated, but tagged (home, work, cycling, etc etc) and/or prioritized (high, medium, someday, etc)
 What I'd like to see is a single view including (in order):
 (by default, ignore tags; but be nice if the below could also be filtered down to 1 or more tags as well)
 - dated yet unfinished tasks for today
 - tasks that are pass due (dated for yesterday or earlier, and not checked off)
 - tasks that are undated, sorted by priority (descending)
 I don't want to have to cycle views for this, which is the trick; every to-do system in the planet can let you show upcoming or late to-dos, or the ones by tag, or the undated ones. I want the combined single view, so can glance and go.
 Most to-do applications (such as Apple Reminders) let you create smart lists that you pick very specific criteria, without OR functionality; so date for tomorrow, but not date for tomorrow+undated; a specific priority, but no sort by priority after picking two priorities say, that sort of thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've started a new job writing lisp, and using emacs as the default environment. I'm still learning the editor (and the language), but the part I'm having the most trouble adapting to is C-z C-x C-c C-v commands that are standard with Windows. Given that I've used those commands since I've used computers in general, I don't think it's going to be easy to switch over.
 I've seen that there is a mode that sort of removes that possibility, CUA mode, but it seems like it would interfere with most of the slime commands. C-c and C-x seem to be very busy keys.
 And so I have thought of a solution that I think would work, and it's crackpot enough that I think trying it will be fun. I'm not completely sure it will work, and so am requesting community input.
 OK, so here's the plan. I'm going to de-mothball my custom keyboard which allows me to remap keys. Then I would remap the Caps-Lock key to one of the F13-F24 keys, and then using that as the Control for emacs sequences. C-c would be (Caps lock)-c and C-x would be (Caps lock)-x. I think that's possible to change in my init file? Emacs has proven to be a remarkable beast in its extensibility and I'm like 90% sure that this is doable.
 Anyway, I am wondering if there is some obvious problem with this plan, other than the glaringly obvious one which is that it's less trouble to just learn the shortcuts. (What's the fun in that, though?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been throwing together bits of elisp over the past few months and it's sort of turned into a tiny little major mode for Typescript (and Javascript) webapp files: https://github.com/orzechowskid/tsx-mode.el
 indentation and jit-lock syntax highlighting are powered by tree-sitter, and code analysis and completion are powered by lsp-mode. servers and grammars for both should be automatically installed and configured for you. tagged template strings for some common CSS-in-JS patterns are indented and support code-folding, and have CSS syntax highlighting and completion applied to them when point is inside of them.
 I've been using this at work and at home for a while now and am very pleased with it. but I'm positive there are hidden assumptions it makes and/or failures in handling use-cases which I personally don't have, so I'd love to get extra eyes on it to see where it can improve. comments (or PRs!) are very welcome.
 thanks for looking!

 Is there a solution, perhaps to just check a region instead of the whole buffer?

For me, it’s all very abstract, but I feel like I’m making slow progress. Sometimes the intuition doesn’t work for me, then I try to let me guide by the types. When implementing toListOf I get stuck because “type tetris” doesn’t help anymore:
 They start with
 toListOf :: Traversal s s a a -> (s -> [a]) 
 where a Traversal s t a b s is a function
 forall f. Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> (s -> f t) 
 Then, they generalize Traversal s s a a to
 (a -> Const (Endo [a]) a) -> (s -> Const (Endo [a]) s)

What are factors to consider, when choosing EXWM vs. any other tiling WM? 
 Would you tell me which tiling WM you use and why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do use use-package but for a lot of packages there is not install and config instructions for it.
 This is my working configuration which I have some questions about.
  
The eglot start (via eglot-ensure) is configured in the (use-package python-mode block via a :hook. Python modes starts eglot. Is this a good solution? 
 company start is configured via a :hook in (use-package company block and starts when eglot comes up.
  
```emacslisp ; .... ; language server (replacement for lsp-mode) (use-package eglot)
 (use-package python-mode :ensure nil ; makes sure that Emacs in-build python-mode is used :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) ; connect to language server when py-file is opened :custom (python-shell-interpreter "python3") )
 (use-package company :after eglot ; this line alone does not help to start company :hook (eglot-managed-mode . company-mode) ; starts company when eglot is started )
 (use-package company-box :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))
 ; ..... ```
 I have some more examples; e.g. the ws-buttler. Do I start it that way?  (use-package ws-butler :init (progn (add-hock 'python-mode-hook 'ws-butler-mode))) 
 Or with a :hook where I do not know what I have to write there.  (use-package ws-butler :hook ?????? 
 Or should I use the python-mode?  (use-package python-mode :ensure nil ; makes sure that Emacs in-build python-mode is used :hook (python-mode . ws-butler-mode) 
 On important point is that e.g. ws-butler-mode should not only start when a Python buffer is opened. It should only work in that Python buffers and not in others after it is started.
 As a newbie it is very hard to decide which configuration ways I should use to start a mode. Should the mode install itself in via a hook to another mode (python)? Should the other mode (python) start it? etc etc

I want to show the time-grid and items that are due today at the top of the agenda. For some reason, instead of showing today, it always shows the items for three days ago. So, the image here is from running the agenda on Friday 18 March, but it shows items for Tuesday 15 March. 
 Here is the code used to create this:
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("o" "Overview" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 'day) (org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Today" :time-grid t :date today :todo "TODAY" :scheduled today :order 1)))))))))

        <updated>2022-03-18T05:28:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My code: ```haskell
 data Counter a = Counter Integer a | Increment instance Functor Counter where fmap f (Counter count x) = Counter count (f x) fmap f Increment = Increment instance Applicative Counter where pure x = Counter 0 x (<*>) (Counter count1 f) (Counter count2 x) = Counter (count1 + count2) (f x) (<*>) Increment (Counter count x) = Counter (count + 1) x --Unsure if these two follow applicative laws tbh (<*>) (Counter count f) Increment = Increment (<*>) Increment Increment = Increment 
 ```
 My error:
 ```sh
 <interactive>:121:41: error: * Couldn't match type `a' with `b' Expected: Counter b Actual: Counter a `a' is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: (Prelude.<*>) :: forall a b. Counter (a -> b) -> Counter a -> Counter b at <interactive>:120:5-9 `b' is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: (Prelude.<*>) :: forall a b. Counter (a -> b) -> Counter a -> Counter b at <interactive>:120:5-9 * In the expression: Counter (count + 1) x In an equation for `Prelude.<*>': (Prelude.<*>) Increment (Counter count x) = Counter (count + 1) x In the instance declaration for `Applicative Counter' * Relevant bindings include x :: a (bound at <interactive>:121:36) (<*>) :: Counter (a -> b) -> Counter a -> Counter b (bound at <interactive>:120:5) 
 ``` Alright, so for my own personal education I'm trying to figure out how applicatives relate to effects outside of monads.
 My interpretation of an effect is something which changes the data structure, but is not affected by fmap
 The solution I came up with was to put the effect data as part of the "main" constructor, and the effect action as a union'd constructor. Thing is this type error is messing with me, and I'm not sure how to resolve it. First of all, is my interpretation of what an effect is wrong? Secondly, why is Counter a /= Counter b in this error message? They're both generic, so why is it having trouble with a = b?

 Very long-time emacs user but not a programmer (ASIC engineer - mostly working with SystemVerilog, Python, BASH, and TCL) so I can only go so far with emacs-lisp. Running 27.2 and I use ibuffer with ibuffer-formats and ibuffer-saved-filter-groups to organize all my types of files and directories I'm working on. I want a column that contains the directory paths to the buffers' files. I want this so I can display it with ibuffer-formats and filter on it in ibuffer-saved-filter-groups to keep track of files with the same name but for different projects.
 I've defined a couple of simple columns but can't figure out how to do this for path. I looked at the standard ones in ibuffer.el like filename but the code is a bit beyond my pay grade. I'd really appreciate any help or pointers for this. Some day I'll have time to become an emacs-lisp guru, but that time, unfortunately, is not now.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, learning FP and Haskell.
 I'm confused by the claim that FP is about programming the "what" and not the "how" (see 2nd paragraph in wiki). How could you possibly write a computer program without telling the computer what to do (the how)?
 The closest answer I've gathered is that FP is essentially about term rewriting systems (using beta reduction in particular). A rewriting step is analogous to a state transition step in turing machines. So then that means the compiler handles all the control flow for you, rather than FP somehow magically eliminating the need for control flow and other imperative ideas.
 Is this understanding correct? What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I do a lot personally is editing and running python project in remote servers, which almost always come with their own condo environments. I'm currently trying to do this in emacs with python-mode, lsp-mode and conda-mode. The command conda-activate works perfectly with lsp on my local machine, but when using tramp, it seems that the same command can only select environments from my local conda, no the remote one.
 Is there a way around this? Or is this unavoidable?
 Before getting into emacs, I used vim. Keeping a copy of vim in remote server was easy enough and access through ssh works nicely. If it's impossible to use conda environments on remote, is it possible to create some type of emacs client on remote and run something like graphic ssh?

 This python function is a simple recursive function with an if statement with multiple nested if statements within it. 
 The problem is when I converted this code to haskell I used guards and it's very much unreadable. Just to give as an example, this is one of my guards:
 | indexTxt < length txt && pat !! indexPat == txt !! indexTxt && (indexPat + 1) == length pat = findPat txt pat (indexTxt + 1) (calcPrefix pat 1 0 [] !! indexPat + 1) (mIndexes ++ [(indexTxt + 1) - (indexPat + 1)]) 
 It doesn't even fit on the screen as you can see.
 Is there any way to make my function more readable? I imagine I need to find some other way to makes this code more readable and preferably smaller, but I have no idea what my options are.
 Any help/tips/guidance would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have moved to use Straight.el, everything worked great. I even tried to copy my config into another device, opened Emacs, Straight downloaded all packages automatically and Emacs there worked great too! 
 Then, I noticed that on the other device there is no elpa folder inside .emacs.d, I thought this makes sense as I don't use it anymore and disable it by putting (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) inside early-init.el. So I deleted the elpa folder, restarted emacs but now emacsclient -c tries to create a new frame but it gets crashed instantly without any error message. Restoring elpa folder solves the issue!
 There is no mention to elpa folder in my configs.
 How could I debug the issue?

 The problem is my config, the org file, has a lot of sections. If I dont want to use a section, I have to manually open the org file then go to the specfific bullet and do :noexport. 
 I am looking to implement some sort of menu that pops up on startup and allows you to choose whichever config you want. For example, I can choose "Essential" and only config under the "Essential" bullet gets loaded. 
 Is this possible? Looking for some pointers, any help is appreciated.

 I don't think this is the right approach. Because It seems that changing "placeholder" for every hypothesis is extremely inefficient. There should be a better way.
 Can anyone suggest a way that I can think in "type language" way? 
 To give a more concrete example, consider the following scenario. 
 say you are using scala, you want to test a function for a case that only return int (maybe the function that you want to use only return int type.), but the function ultimattely accepts generic type. To test this function that return int in typed language, I have to always change signature to always fit my "testing hypothesis" that only care about int. I think you should get an idea now. because one need to change signature when testing certain hypothesis, I don't think it is a sufficient strategy. There must be a better way. Any idea? or debugging technique you use in this scenario.

 I've been an emacs user since around 1981. My .emacs still has some snippets from those days. I've used org-mode for literate multi-language programming and went through a phase some years ago where I used it for task tracking, but it was never quite satisfying. 
 I've been journaling and taking notes (personal and work) since the '90s, for about the last decade on OneNote. It's got excellent sync (win/mac/android/web), a word-processor-like UI, and fast, accurate search. But a few things finally made me switch away: totally vendor-locked-in data format (the big one), lack of easy tagging and links, and no proper source blocks - as a software dev, I felt that every day.

The advantages of placing datetime to the beginning of file names is tidy and sortable. I think.

 I have been working as a data engineer for about six years. And at present, I'm working for a foreign-invested company, using Scala as my working language writing Spark code, complicated UDFs, etc. However there seem not have a movement of people from global and my local company.
 My second language is English. In addition, I started a family in my native country and have two girls aged 4 and 1.
 I want to ask, if to become an immigrant to an English speaking country, what should be my next move? Should I apply for a Scala job remotely and then go abroad to work? Thank you so much.

WebAssembly code generation GHC, we need to compile GHC’s runtime
system to WebAssembly. The libffi library to pure
WebAssembly is an essential dependency of the GHC runtime: it is used
to pass Haskell functions as callback to C functions. As the
implementation of libffi depends on the platform, we’ve had to port
it to WebAssembly.
This blog post introduces libffi, the challenges to make it
work with WebAssembly, demonstrates our implementation, and also
explains how it’s used by GHC runtime. I hope our implementation can
be useful for other people porting projects to WebAssembly (especially

 I have the following workflow:
 I put all my papers in the folder /papers/some.pdf.
 To not loose track, I also create a todo in my /toread.org which links to file:./papers/some.pdf and some more notes.
 When I finally have time to read this paper, I copy the todo (from toread.org) using (org-copy-subtree) and then (org-yank) it in a newly created file /summaries/somepapernotes.org
 The problem is that the link to file:./papers/some.pdf won't work in /summaries/somepapernotes.org. It will point to /summaries/papers/some.pdf which doesn't exist. So I have to manually edit the link to file:../papers/some.pdf
 This manual step is annoying the deeper the hierarchy is. Is there a better way which adjusts the relative links automatically when I move subtrees up and down the hierarchy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone. I am learning about programming with monads. I discovered the following while traversing a data structure with a State monad, but it's easier to demonstrate with the IO monad. 
 If I use boolean operators, they will only evaluate the arguments that they need. e.g.: 
 Prelude> False && undefined False Prelude> True && undefined *** Exception: Prelude.undefined 
 So far, so good. This is what you'd expect. However, if I use the liftM group of functions to lift && to a monad, this no longer works. e.g.:
 falsify :: IO Bool falsify = putStrLn "It is a falsehood." >> return False verify :: IO Bool verify = putStrLn "Verily, it is so." >> return True liftedAnd :: Monad m => m Bool -> m Bool -> m Bool liftedAnd = liftM2 (&&) 
 Then, calling it in ghci:
 *Main> falsify `liftedAnd` verify It is a falsehood. Verily, it is so. False 
 So, you can't use liftedAnd for flow control. It's easy enough to write an AND function that behaves properly:
 mAnd :: Monad m => m Bool -> m Bool -> m Bool mAnd x y = x >>= \b -> if b then y else return False 
 Now, in ghci:
 *Main> falsify `mAnd` verify It is a falsehood. False 
 So, my questions are:
  
Would someone please explain why liftM2 behaves this way?
 Is there somewhere in the standard libraries to look for properly behaved && || if/then/else etc. for monads?
 Am I missing some key fact about liftM2? Perhaps I am not using it in the intended way.

 I put in a support ticket and was told to use their Haskell vscode extensions in the IDE, but I'm completely lost and haven't found a simple tutorial to explain what I'm supposed to do or how to use them. 
 As an alternative, I can certainly install on a local machine or a VPS, but I feel like I'm missing something obvious with codeanywhere.com. Does anyone have experience working on this platform? What obvious thing am I missing here?

 im using Doom Emacs, already asked in the help section in discord, sadly no answer received :(
 my lsp-workspaces folders list in like lsp-workspace-folders-switch resets to my home directory after restarting emacs. So that only my home directory is recognized as a workspace folder.
 But I don't want to have my home directory as a lsp-workspace-folder. I only want to have the specific project directories as workspace folders.Well, it still works fine when I delete the home directory via lsp-workspace-folders-removeand reopen the project directory and interactively select the directory. But after restarting emacs it just resets it to my home directory
 Does anyone have any idea what the reason is or how to fix this?Any ideas are appreciated.

This allows me to reliably find time bottlenecks in my code.
 The problem is that I have to manually factor out my code into all these separate {-# SCC #-} functions.
 Are there any plans to do what I suggested in the title? It would be cool if I could select lines of code and have them marked to automatically get factored out into a function of name e.g. func_{FILENAME:LINE}.
 Can anyone here add this? (How much would this cost?)

On my personal mac, it takes about 5-7 seconds to start up (which seems a bit long, but tolerable). On my work mac, on the other hand, startup is about 90s. This wasn't always the case. It initially ran the same on both computers, but one day it suddenly slowed down. I don't remember if I did anything to break it, but the config file is the same on both. 
 I ran the esup profiler and it tells that the total user startup time is 0.123 sec, which is obviously not true (or the the slowdown is not due to the config file). 
 Any idea on what might be going on or how to accurately profile the startup process?

If you are implementing the view's -layout method, you can call -[super layout] instead. Break on void _NSDetectedLayoutRecursion(void) to debug. This will be logged only once. This may break in the future. 
 Of course, I can suppress these warnings by redirecting outputs to /dev/null, but I didn't get such warnings on Big Sur. Is there anyway to fix this warning instead of just redirecting the warnings to /dev/null?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: I want to avoid addressing stereotypes. As an academic, I know that the use of each of the tools and technologies has its own reasons.
 Still, the question remains for me. Why do so many influential emacs users come from the Apple ecosystem? One theory I guess is that the advent of Apple computers and the popularity of emacs coincided. In addition, the similarity of the philosophical origin of these two products can be another reason. What is your opinion?

 I am starting to use EMacs doom to take notes and organise my digital system (non programmer here).
 I am currently trying to build my workflow and I didn’t yet found a solution for the following: searching recursively in all subdirectories and open one file among the result with the default app. I have tried to use projectile and it works for searching recursively but I am not able to open files with defaul app (e.g. a pdf).
 Is there a way to achieve this?
 Thanks for the help

 Tonight I installed emacs 29 with brew install emacs-app-good from jimeh/emacs-builds. Very much appreciate the work jimeh has done. But I don't see any build flags, and don't otherwise know how to remove the title bar.
 I'd be happy to learn how to remove title bar from either Emacs 28 or 29, I'm not wedded to 29. Thanks!

 My corfu setup is:
 (use-package corfu :straight t :defer t :diminish :bind (:map corfu-map ("TAB" . corfu-next) ([tab] . corfu-next) ("S-TAB" . corfu-previous) ([backtab] . corfu-previous) ("C-j" . corfu-next) ("C-k" . corfu-previous))) 
 "C-j" works completely fine, but "C-k" executes the action evil-insert-digraph (not entirely sure what that does...).
 Any suggestions are appreciated!

 I copied this diagram by Martin Grund from https://punchcard.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/emacs-movement-shortcuts-wallpaper/ with the aim of making a printable version. If you want to edit it yourself, I've got the original .drawio file in the gist too, but it only renders as text. You'd have to save it and open it with https://www.diagrams.net/ or the application you can download from there.
 I am still trying to figure out the best presentation of the printable version, so any general suggestions will be very much appreciated. The aim is to have something that will be visible and useful printed on a sheet of Letter or A4 paper, viewed from about 3 feet away. (in other words, the distance from my eyes to the patch of wall where I've got a copied pinned up!)

 Trying to do more with emacs, I wanted to integrate my conda environments into my workflow. I spotted the conda.el package, and tried to install it with use-package : elisp (use-package conda :ensure t :init (setq conda-anaconda-home (expand-file-name "~/miniconda3")) (setq conda-env-home-directory (expand-file-name "~/miniconda3")) :config (conda-env-initialize-interactive-shells) (conda-env-initialize-eshell))  This does not pose any issue when evaluated (and I've checked on github, people do it that way). My miniconda install is indeed in ~/miniconda3. However, when I try to execute M-x conda-env-activate, I get the following message : Symbol's value as variable is void : proper-dir
 Has anyone any idea how to fix this? Or is there another way to activate conda environments inside of emacs?

 It seems to me that uuid is "the way to go" for creating IDs for linking since they are guaranteed unique, and will survive movement of a heading to another tree or file. Right?
 So I'm just starting to get into the whole linking-thingy in org mode, and it seems like I'll need to call org-id-get-create just about every time before org-store-link. Rather than make both calls each time, would it make sense to create a new function, my-org-id-get-create-and-store-link, so it simply calls both functions? Could someone help me with a function that will do both id creating and link storing?
 I do have the following set:
 (setq org-id-link-to-org-use-id t) 
 Such a function must have been done before a thousand times, right? Or am I missing something in terms of id creation and workflow?

 def mapFile(filePath:String): Map[String, Int] = { Source.fromFile(filePath).getLines().map { line => line.split(" ").map{ word=> (word,1) }.toMap.withDefaultValue(0) } } 
 Basically, 1st I try to iterate over the lines of the file, and then iterate over each word that is obtained when the line is splitted by spaces. The problem that this is returning me Iterator[scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int]], not Map[String, Int], so Im getting and error.
 Any idea how could I get the desired Map with all the words and 1 values?
 An example would be having the following file as input:
 hello this is a test bye 
 And the output should look like:
 Map("hello" -> 1, "this" -> 1 , "is" -> 1 , "a" -> 1 , "test" -> 1 , "bye" -> 1)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since monads can be seen as some sort of "container" (functor), you might expect monad transformers to "contain" a value of the base monad. It's the opposite though: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.6.0.4/docs/src/Control.Monad.Trans.Maybe.html#MaybeT
 newtype MaybeT m a = MaybeT { runMaybeT :: m (Maybe a) } 
 I would have expected "Maybe (m a)" instead of "m (Maybe a)"
 All the others I checked are similar (StateT and ExcepT).
 Is there a hand wavy explanation for that ? I can see that monad and transformer laws apply, but I don't really understand why it's this way.

 Is there a way to debug C++ in a docker with emacs ?
 What did you expect to happen?
 I'm launching gdb in emacs(I use DOOM) with this command after <Alt+x>, gdb :
 gdb -i=mi /docker:name_of_docker_container:/mnt/build/logicalError -ex "set substitute-path /home/name_on_manjaro/CPP-Debug-Docker/ /mnt/"
 I was expecting no issue because of "set substitute-path".
 What actually happened?
 I'm trying to use gdb on code in a docker but it is not working well. I can debug with gud-gdb(console on left and code on right) but not with gdb "gdb -i=mi" (with all information in 6 windows).
 I tried it on manjaro (and also ubuntu) with different projet. To be sure, I tested with this simple projet to reproduce with "hello world" and a docker and I have the same result : http…]]></summary>

 The use case for candy (THIS JUST A FINITE STATE MACHINE):
 ```
 Let's implement a finite state automaton that models a simple candy dispenser. The machine has two inputs: you can insert a coin, or you can dispense candy by turning the knob. It can be in one of two states: locked or unlocked. It also tracks how many candies are left and how many coins it contains.
 - Inserting a coin into a locked machine will unlock it if there’s still any candy left.
 - Turning the knob on an unlocked machine will cause it to dispense one candy and return to a locked state.

 Hope you're doing great. I'm using Emacs for about 15 years (So basically a rookies in scale of Emacs :P). Based on my experience over the years and specially in the recent times, not many people know about the wonderful world of Emacs and why it is such a fascinating tool. To me they are missing out a chance to enjoy Emacs. So, a while ago I've decided to create a video series and talk about Emacs Lisp in context of a long running project to create an "editor" with Emacs Lisp, In hope to help more people to enjoy the tool that changed the way I use computers and brought me joy over all these years.
 Yesterday, I recorded the 4th episode of the video series. I thought to myself that It might be a good idea to share it on this subreddit as well. I have a looooooong term plan for this series and looking forward to your feedback.
 Like to the latest episode(4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE1XUfrrGYI

 * Pictures Used :noexport:
 #+caption: something here
 #+name: fig:test
 [[filepath]]
 * This should be exported
 [[fig:test]]

 or something along these lines. The issues that arise are
  
the :noexport: stops the fig:test from being referenced at all and doesn't export
 if the :noexport is removed, then it just exports inside the Pictures Used section, and a link is created to that location where I want the image itself
  
any help on this matter would be very useful, thank you.

 I‘m immensely grateful for inline-java, and soon JVM‘s own FFI will improve over JNI, which is great in its own right. But do we have something for embedding C# code as well? Or some stable IPC to CLR or some other integrated way with little overhead that’s more robust than crude subprocessing or RPC?

 I've just updated to 27.1 on Ubuntu 21.10, and I'm encountering some weird behaviour with "M-.'
 Basically, it pops up a small "text bubble" where I can type a macro, which can get executed with enter. (See screenshot)
 I cannot figure out which commando is bound to M-. so I can disable it. Describe-key does not seem to work and overwriting it does not seem to help either
 My previous behavior was that M-. was bound to xref-find-definitions.

 I wanted to order an Emacs t-shirt from FSF.org but the shipping cost of 16 USD for a t-shirt that costs 25 USD is quite high for me.
 Could please recommend me an online store where I can buy an Emacs t-shirt with low shipping cost? Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For certain reasons I am switching from LSP-mode to Eglot. I am a Python developer who works a lot with conda environments. Sometimes I will open a python file before realising I am in the wrong conda environment. This means the LSP server (pyright) started with LSP-mode uses the wrong Python interpreter, not giving completions for libraries which are envionment-specific.
 For this reason, in LSP-mode, I had:
 (add-hook 'conda-postactivate-hook (lambda () (lsp-restart-workspace)))
 I cannot find the equivalent for Eglot. If I do:
 (add-hook 'conda-postactivate-hook (lambda () (eglot-reconnect)))
 Note I am using the conda.el package for conda environment switching.
 This does not work, instead I get the error "Error running timer: Process EGLOT (test/python-mode) not running"
 Is there a way for me to cleanly restart Eglot in the buffer as though I had changed environments before visiting the file? Note, if I change environments first and then open the file, Eglot is correctly started in the proper environment.
 Any help appreciated!

 I have been looking at the distage example (https://github.com/7mind/distage-example), and it looks very promising for writing effectful programs that work both with ZIO and cats-effect as the effect implementation. Although I do wonder if the same can be achieved by defining the APIs in terms of a trifunctor effect, instead of the bifunctor effect type showcased in the example.
 Would appreciate any input on this or links to further related materials.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I have this very simple org file,which looks like this:
 #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[scaled=1.5]{helvet} \renewcommand\familydefault{\sfdefault} Testing equation #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex \begin{equation*} 1 + 1 = 2 \end{equation*} #+END_EXPORT 
 Basically, just write out a line and then a Latex export block. The first line can be used to control the font size, by setting scaled to be whatever you want, it is set to 1.5 in this case. I cant seem to change the font size of the export latex block. You can see in this picture below:

 The body text is gigantic but the latex export font is not affected. How do I change this font size globally? I have a lot of these Latex export in my real document, and would like to know how to do that. 
 Appreciate all the help.
