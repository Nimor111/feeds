        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years without issue where I could choose, for example, to see my daily work agenda, the filters are now failing to be applied. This is in org 9.6.15, as shipped with my emacs 29.3. Here is my definition from my use-package org :custom section:
  (org-agenda-custom-commands '(("w" . "Work") ("wd" "Work Day" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 1) (org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil) (org-agenda-regexp-filter-preset '("+ODH\\|AGENDA\\|CONFERENCE" "-TSA\\|PRIESTHOOD"))))) nil))) 
 Why has this stopped applying my filter when it worked for so long? Is it a bug, or do I need to change something to make it up-to-date?
 (I'm cross-posting this to both reddit and the orgmode mailing list since the two audiences might not overlap much)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was reading the book Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton. In chapter 11, the game tic-tac-toe is implemented. My question is about the AI part of the game, where minimax is used. I was a little bit confused about the prune function:
 prune :: Int -> Tree a -> Tree a
 prune 0 (Node x _) = Node x []
 prune n (Node x ts) = Node x [prune (n-1) t | t <- ts]
 Why do we need such a prune function in Haskell (which has lazy evaluation). Why can't we just create a single infinite game tree, and run the fitness function on it to a certain depth, without creating a new finite tree via pruning? We can then reuse the same tree, by cutting it from the top after each move, and sort of expanding the (same) tree downwards. Shouldn't this also work? 
 I then saw that one of the exercises of that chapter was:
 generate the game tree once, rather than for each move 
 A solution for that exercise is provided here by someone on Github. However, it seems to me that here a new tree is generated after each move, and thus the tree is not shared during the whole game.

Is it possible to save this set of windows/layout and quickly switch to it in the future? Or when I'm programming, I typically have a main window with my code on the left with two smaller windows (compilation and vterm) next to it. I would like to be able to quickly switch between sets of predefined windows within a frame. Wouldn't that be amazing? Is such a thing possible?

 I've been using Emacs for 2+ years now. I started using because of its capabilities in VHDL coding, but soon got inspired by its efficiency. However, I feel I am severely underutilizing its potential. I'm a PhD student in Computer Engineering, and mainly use it for coding in python (with jedi). With this context, I want to ask the following questions:
  
Best package for Python? I find jedi decent, but not coding-friendly. I want to code faster in Python.
 For a Mac user, what are the key-bindings you suggest is optimal?
 Best use cases of org-mode as a PhD student?
 Best LaTeX packages & engines I need to install on Emacs? Currently I use Overleaf to work with collaborators, but would love to work on Emacs and push things to Overleaf (my vim friend does this).
 Ways to use Co-Pilot on Emacs? Is it worth it?
 Any other cool Emacs things (packages or modes) I should learn as a PhD student?
 Any cool stuff that can wow me about Emacs?
  
Please feel free to help even if you are not a PhD student. My goal is to learn how to use Emacs better at the end of the day..

 Is there an online place where I can paste some Scala 2 code with required braces, and have it show me that same code converted into Scala 3 braceless syntax?
 Does Scastie do it? If so, how? {related ticket, please go vote for it}
 Does the IntelliJ Scala plug-in facilitate it? If so, how? (related ticket, please go vote for it)
  
Here's a solution posted as a Reddit comment
  
This auto conversion would be invaluable for anyone who is distantly related to a Scala 2 project (or StackOverflow Question or Answer) and would like to easily explore the new Scala 3 syntax without having to invest a whole day in spurious technical tangents trying to configure something to enable them to do so.
 There are almost 20 years of Scala 2 codebases and forum code snippets where this would ease the ROI analysis of a Scala 3 explorer.
 tl;dr The overhead for experimenting with converting a Scala 2 code snippet into Scala 3 braceless syntax is so high for all but the most motivated Scala advocates.
 Wouldn't reducing the barrier to entry for casual drive-by exploration in something like Scastie (or IntelliJ) with a Scala 2 code snippet from the wild seems like it would be worth its weight in attention-grabbing and capturing the legions of possibly interested Java and Python software engineers?

This flow diagram was introduced in Field Report #5: How I Prepare Reading and Processing Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson:

I was hoping to discuss/ask some questions regarding it as I was recently processing it.
I'm guessing @Sascha will have to speak to this the most. But I am happy to have any others engage or share their thoughts.
Human Group
I was trying to understand the "Human" grouping and its sub-entities. What is it supposed to mean exactly? Is it what is happening within a human? Is there a semantic difference between the shapes under "human" and "zettelkasten?"
Is the entity under "human" an emergent outcome of the process it is connected to? For example, "overview of literature" is emerges in human understanding (ideally) when "researching" the "Sources of the world" and finding "Promising sources"?
Zettelkasten Group
What is the difference between the general group Zettelkasten (as opposed to Human) and the container "Zettelkasten" that has the two entities and one process "Atomic thoughts and connections," "Structuring & Integrating," and "Overview, Tools, Complex Insights"? Is the general group the Zettelkasten Method and the container the actual archive?
And, if the general group "Zettelkasten" is the Zettelkasten Method, what should the whole be called since the Zettelkasten method is a part of the whole?
Pre-processing
Is this a part of the barbell method (the first pass) or not?]]></summary>

I was thinking about doing multiple mini projects to learn and understand each types/type classes. My end goal is to make some server side projects in Haskell and to be ready to work with types and type class things when I use those frameworks or db frameworks like persistent. So what kind of smaller projects helped you learn particular types/type class. Is there some website like typeclassopedia that'd give some exercise, mini projects to teach these concepts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently using rjsx-mode package to work on jsx files and would like to add it to be the default mode to mdx files as well. Config currently looks like this with use-package:
 (use-package rjsx-mode
 :mode ("\\.tsx\\'")
 :hook ((rjsx-mode . lsp-deferred)
 (rjsx-mode . emmet-mode))
 :config
 (add-to-list 'lsp-enabled-clients 'ts-ls))
 I can add "\\.mdx\\'" to the mode definition however I want to use a different lsp client for the file type specifically mdx-language-server rather than ts-ls. Trying to decide the best way to handle this. I think one way would be to derive a mode from rjsx-mode but that seems like it might be overkill since there is no mode difference, just a difference in the configuration block. Probably thinking of the problem wrong.

 minbpe-hs
 Introduction
 minbpe-hs is a port of Andrej Karpathy's concise byte-level byte pair encoding (BPE) implementation, minbpe, to Haskell. During training, BPE compresses a sequence by repeatedly finding the most frequent pair of elements in the input and merging them into a new token whilst maintaining a record of the merges and the tokens. Encoding is performed by recursively merging pairs with the smallest merge index until there remain no pairs to be merged, and encoded representations can be decoded backed into the original through vocabulary look-ups. Given its recursive nature, BPE lends itself naturally to functional programming, and the objective of this repository is to offer an alternative functional formulation of it that is orthogonal to typical imp…]]></summary>

 Since I consider myself a part of this subreddit for some years, I wanted to let you know that I'm going to stop using reddit.
 As you might have expected, I've written a blog article explaining the reasons.
 I won't say that I will never ever log in to my reddit account and might contribute a comment in future. But chances to do so are poor because I will remove reddit from my feeds.
 I'm certainly not going to miss reddit as a platform. I surely will miss this subreddit community here. You've been great and I hope you will follow my ideas on embracing open solutions like Atom/RSS/Fediverse/Usenet in order to connect to each other for topics related to this subreddit.
 For now, I'm focusing on my blog, my Mastodon account, my new PIM lecture starting in October, and maybe also start writing on my PIM book which is in the concept and planning stage for over a decade.
 I really hope to see you on a better platform which respects its users and their contributions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone.
I consider this forum kind of “highly lectured” because we are all fans of knowledge and pretty much love to read, learn and improve everything we do. I picture us as carpenters working in the middle of the woods crafting excellence, although instead of wood and carpenter tools we use our brains, our zettlekasten and pen.
I don’t want to say too much because it’s not the point. Let’s just say I lost something that was really important to me. Something I cared, cherished, loved, tried to understand and that always put a smile on my face.
Now that it’s lost I have to learn what to do with this. I meditate and being mindful of all the feelings that arise inside me has been a really interesting experience. It of course doesn’t stop the grief or the sadness, but I think it makes it healthy. I’m at peace with my feelings, seeing me as the place where the river just has to flow.
I’m considering reading Albert Camus - The Stranger and No Mud no Lotus - Thich Nhat Hanh.
I’ve read before this event in my life works from stoicism and Buddhism which I think are really helping me to experience this in the best way possible.
Well, thanks for reading and I will appreciate the suggestions of books you found helpful during times where your psyche was put to the test.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya, just released this package that I was working on these past two days..
 It is a readwise integration for org-mode that will sync your readwise highlights into a org-format buffer or file.
 I use readwise heavily for highlights in both physical books and ebooks and have during the past year started using readwise reader heavily to annotate webpages and got so tired of not having a proper way to sync the highlights and notes into emacs. So I decided to just roll my own solution!
 There are quite a few quirks with the package right now, the main one being that it currently cleans the buffer and then repopulates it with the newly synced entries.. I am working for a smarter fix for this where it actually respects the buffer contents and just adds new highlights or modifies changed highlights to the correct entries, but I need to make this perfomant enough to not be a pain in the bottom to use..
 Well, here is the code! https://github.com/CountGreven/org-readwise I hope this helps some of you!

 Let's say I have a lot of open buffers, then do consult-buffer and type .py. From there I do embark-collect and now I have a collection buffer with all of the matching buffers from consult-buffer. Now I want to embark-act consult-line-multi on all of those buffers in the collection, so I can search only the one's I've narrowed down previously.
 This behaves in the way you expect using the buffer name as the search parameter for consult-line-multi searching across all of my buffers. Is there some additional step I can add to make consult-line-multi only search the collected buffers?
 Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a small program in Haskell that allows me to interact with Google's Gemini via Terminal and via VIM.
 It worked for about a week and then, suddenly, every request resulted in a connection timeout.
 At first, I thought the issue was with my API key, or with the fact that I was using a VPN. But while debugging, I've discovered that EVERY SINGLE REQUEST done with http-conduit fails.
 For example: If I open ghci -package http-conduit and run
 parseRequest "GET https://www.facebook.com" >>= httpBS 
 I get a Connection timeout exception.
 It does not matter what website I choose. I should say that CURL has no problem getting the responses, so it is definitely not my internet connection (evidenced by the fact that I'm asking for help here).
 What could be causing this?

 However, I also enjoy using siunitx. Unfortunately siunitx v.3 is not supported by mathjax v.3, or even worse, siunitx.js for mathjax is no longer maintained ( https://github.com/burnpanck/MathJax-siunitx ). As a consequence, equations containing siunitx commands are not displayed using mathjax, e.g. you still see
 \begin{equation}
 \left[ L \right] = \unit{\ohm\second} = \unit{\henry} 
 \end{equation} 
 when previewing.
 Does anybody has some ideas to circumvent the problem by defining some dummy routines substituting the siunitx stuff, e.g. the display could be
 [L] = \ohm\second = \henry
 or just
 [L] = 
 Maybe even a secret siunitx.js v.3 is arround...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had emacs set up as a webdev environment for javascript and php.
 I've got web-mode installed for these languages, and I had lsp-mode running. 
 Earlier this evening lsp stopped working.
 When I would open a php or js file, a message would come up in the minibuffer indicating that the respective language server woudn't start.
 I nuked my emacs config and then I uninstalled and reinstalled the language servers and emacs.
 Then I reinstalled web-mode and lsp.
 But I'm still getting the same issue.
 At the moment my messages buffer has these lines repeating:
  
LSP :: Restarting LSP in buffer test.js
 LSP :: Connected to [ts-ls:49920/starting /home/mantis/tmp].
 LSP :: ts-ls has exited (exited abnormally with code 1)
 Server ts-ls:49920/starting exited (check corresponding stderr buffer for details). Do you want to restart it? (y or n) y
 LSP :: Restarting LSP in buffer test.js
 LSP :: Connected to [ts-ls:49926/starting /home/mantis/tmp].
 LSP :: ts-ls has exited (exited abnormally with code 1)
 Beginning of buffer [6 times]
 previous-line: Beginning of buffer [20 times]
  
So how do I fix this mess?
 I've gotten very used to emacs for js/php and I'd really like to keep using it. But I need these IDE features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone.
 About a year ago, I started noticing random freezing of Emacs when saving files, freezing so long to the point that Emacs starts crashing. They were super annoying as 1) the crashes never saves anything and I lose some of my progress, even with autosaves; 2) they seem to happen frequent enough to notice, yet too sporadic to reproduce and investigate.
 Over a couple months, I ran some bisects and located the issue: it was the GC threshold.
 I tried blindly setting gc-cons-threshold myself and installing GCMH. The problems still persisted.
 I removed the GC setting for quite some time, but the noticeable slowdown during editing made be return to GCMH. With it came back the problem.
 Is there any reason behind this behavior? Is there a way to correct this?
 My Emacs configurations can be found in: here.
 Thanks a ton!

        <updated>2024-05-22T23:58:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, I'd appreciate some basic assistance. I'm playing around with sum types (or ADTs) of records, and I get this odd bit of behavior.
  ghci> :set -XRecordWildCards ghci> data V = V{x :: Int, y :: Int} | W{a :: Int, b :: Int} deriving Show ghci> testq v@V{..} = v{x = 9} ghci> testq w@W{..} = w{a = 9} ghci> testq x = x ghci> :t testq testq :: p -> p ghci> testq V{x = 1, y = 1} V {x = 1, y = 1} 
 First, I don't know why the type of the function is p -> p rather than V -> V. Second, I don't know why the function fails to change the x value to 9 on the last line. That might simply be my ignorance of how RecordWildCards works.
 In general, are sum types of records a terrible idea? Will things break if some of the records have fields with the same name? I suppose name clashes could be addressed by defining the records separately in their own namespaces, and then putting them all together in the sum type. Finally, if there's a particular reference that would be valuable for better understanding how records work in Haskell, I'd appreciate a pointer. But perhaps the manual is sufficient: https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/records.html
 Thank you.
 EDIT: On a bit of investigation, it appears that you can use the same field in multiple records in a sum type. The bigger issue appears to be when a field is only in one record. You can write code that isn't type safe because it's calling a record selector that works on one record type on a different record type. Unless that's only ghci that lets you do that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm currently using emacs 27.1 at work (cannot install a newer version because we have a old fedora distribution for which no newer emacs exists). And I'd like to use the eshell more. According to this documentation https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eshell/History.html i can search for a last used command by a regex with M-s, which does work. But the cycling through possible other commands via M-n and M-p doesnt work. I can see in a minibuffer, that it is cycling from "history item 27" to "history item 31" etc. but the command is not shown in the eshell. It just shows the first finding.
 Is this an acutal bug or am i getting something wrong? I'd prefer to use as few packages as possible and keep my dependencies low. So i really just need that eshell history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to create a link in my dailies to my present note as soon as a date block (2024-05-23) is existing in my notes. I usually write with org-roam. I must admit, the division between my dailies and other notes is not well done... but it is how I am working now.
 I would like to have the possibility when the point is on a date (for instance 2024-05-22) to create a link in my dailies to the current heading, to the proper daily note if existing, or to a new daily note if not (under a predefined subheading)
 With the help of chatgpt (sorry, no dev here), I have this code:
 ``` (defun my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point () "Create or open an Org-roam daily note for the date at point. If the daily note already exists, add a new heading." (interactive) (let ((date (or (thing-at-point 'date) (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d" (org-read-date nil t))))) (if date (let ((parsed-date (org-read-date nil t date))) (org-roam-dailies-goto-date parsed-date) (when (derived-mode-p 'org-mode) (goto-char (point-max)) (unless (bolp) (insert "\n")) (insert "* "))) (message "No date found at point."))))
 (define-prefix-command 'org-roam-map) (global-set-key (kbd "C-c n") 'org-roam-map)
 (with-eval-after-load 'org-roam (define-key org-roam-map (kbd "d") 'my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point)) ```
 2 problems I see: 1. I want to use a keybinding when the point is on a date to create the link ==> I am not sure the latest part for the creation is OK and that the proper keymap is chosen
  
So far, instead of reading the date at point to create the daily note or insert the link into an existing one, it uses the function org-roam-dailies-goto-date which asks again for a date from the calendar. 
  
how would you improve this function? thanks for your ideas!

 I am thinking of using libraries like https://picocli.info or scallop https://github.com/scallop/scallop. But these will give you CLI facility, not REPL. Is there a library specific for REPL? It should support interactive CLI support such as dynamic filtering etc. Something seen while using oh-my-zsh
 Something similar in javascript - https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk for coloring
 Or I have to code it putting in infinite loop with some time waits or user interuptions ?

I really like Vim motions and Neovim has a headless mode which powers Firenvim and the VS Code Neovim extension, allowing Vim motions in textareas in those apps with Neovim as a backend. I think that would be better than using something like Evil mode which emulates Vim. If there isn't a pre-existing solution, would it be worth learning Elisp and implementing it myself?

 So the past few days I have been trying to improve my problem solving skills using Haskell and I am learning a lot. I have mainly been looking at smaller exercises provided by Advent of Code. I believe these open ended problems provide a good basis for practice as I have a lot of freedom but in this freedom is also what I believe to be the largest pitfall as I can easily resort to thought patterns not meant for the functional paradigm. After working through some exercises I went back to Day 3 ( https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3 ) because when I first looked at it I had no clear idea of what Haskell could provide me in order to solve the problem in a streamlined manner, so I skipped …]]></summary>

 But I can't find the way to create on-the-fly filter with them.
 For example:
 I run find-file then start type into minibuffer: foo
 I will show a list having 4 files has foo
 I want when I press C-c C-m, It would search content of that 4 file, then filter out the files have string bee in it's content. (then the result will only have 2 files)
 Then I could press C-c C-n to reset result tobe 4 file as when I search foo before.
 Is that possible with vertico/consult or I have to use others like orderless, prescient.el?

 A long time ago I used to just use outline-mode and a "one huge text file" approach to this kind of thing.
 I'd about kill to get the asterix indicated outline functionality folded in to wiki-mode.
 I've been a developer for the better part of a half-century, but haven't touched elisp since the 90s.
 How tough is that likely to be? I started cracking in to outline mode to make sense of it, but the code structure is so flat I'm having trouble navigating it.
 Any ideas?

 I've been a web developer since before "Ajax". I rode the wave of Single Page Applications (SPAs) and loved how interactive we could make things. I've written fancy apps in React and Elm.

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I'd love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK and why I'm here:
This forum and my zettelkasten are spaces where I feel comfortable taking risks and trying out new things without the fear of failure holding back. Maintaining a sense of purpose while facing real challenges is crucial. Predicting future developments is a key indicator of expertise in any field. Amateurs react, professionals respond, and masters anticipate.

that definitely was not the case during an internal two-day hackathon Tweag’s GenAI group
held in February.
As one of our projects, we wanted to develop a tool that would tell us where exactly time
flew to in a given period of time, and so was born work-dAIgest: a Python tool that uses your
standard workplace tools (Google Calendar, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Slack, …) and a large
language model (LLM) to summarize what you’ve accomplished.
In this blog post, we’ll present a proof-of-concept of work-dAIgest, show you
what’s under the hood and finally touch quickly on a couple lessons we learned during this
short, but fun project.

 I wanted to try it on the buffer exercise in 4.6
 ```
 • Using ‘xref-find-definitions’, find the source for the
 ‘copy-to-buffer’ function.
 ```
 so I went to copy-to-buffer. Did M-. and it opened a file finder so basically nothing
 I did C-h f on it, went to the file simple.el
 checked where it is at and it is at `/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/` in my mac
 so I opened a terminal, did
 `etags /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/simple.el.gz`
 saw a TAGS file. checked it and I have a value for copy-to-buffer function
 ```
 (fixi) ➜ lisp cat TAGS | grep -i copy-to-buffer
 (defun copy-to-buffer 6813,291207
 ```
 now I went back to emacs, did M-x visit-tags-table
 added the TAGS file.
 checked
 `M-: (symbol-value 'tags-table-list)`
 and saw the right value `("/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/TAGS")`
 now when I try to do M-. on copy-to-buffer or when I try M-x xref-find-definitions and choose copy-to-buffer I get `user-error: Rerun etags: ‘^(defun copy-to-buffer ’ not found in /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/simple.el`
 what am I doing wrong?

 Regardless, I'm writing some Scheme code for fun and practice, and I realized that when I want to be a fancy pants Rich McGee over here and use λ instead of lambda, it doesn't work in emacs like it would in DrRacket -- which sucks because DrRacket is ugly and emacs is pretty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VSCode and Emacs are both excellent editors, and I use them simultaneously on Windows. However, one annoying point is that the keybinding styles of these two editors are inconsistent.
 For example, in VSCode:
  
Ctrl-z -> undo
 Ctrl-x -> cut
 Ctrl-c -> copy
 Ctrl-v -> paste
  
While in Emacs, Ctrl-x and Ctrl-c keys are used as prefix keys (C-x, C-c) for most of Emacs' built-in commands.
 One way to keep they consistent is to use CUA-mode, but its implementation is quite tricky (e.g., cua-prefix-override-inhibit-delay = 0.2), so I'm not very keen on using it.
 Are there any alternatives to CUA-Mode?
 One possibility I can think of is the Windows Key. 
 For example, 
  
Use the Windows Key on the keyboard as Emacs' Control key, which means that the original C-x prefix can be pressed by the Windows Key (you might say that "the prefix key C-x" now is actually "prefix key s-x", but keep in mind it is handled underhood); 
 At the same time, use the Ctrl key on the keyboard as Emacs' Super Key, which means I can bind custom commands to the Super Key.
  
If this works, I can define a clean "cut operation" like: 
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-x") 'kill-region) ; Note here the `s` is actual Ctrl Key not Win Key (Super Key) on keyboard 
 It won't affect prefix key such as C-x, because C-x is now driven by the Windows key.
 Is this possible in Emacs? Does anyone have experience with this? Or do you have a better solution?
 Thanks!

What cat theory concepts will form the 20% that will give 80% output (in the sense it can be used to augment Haskell programming in most of the coding scenarios). I wanted to ask this question so they could learn the most useful and commonly used CT concepts first and then simply focus on mastering programming in Haskell after that. They can then come back to cat theory later on. I thought it'd be hard to try to learn both programming and CT together for beginners.

 this workaround is acceptable for now, I guess:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When typing a commit in Magit, if my commit message gets too long, the editor automatically line-wraps, causing the second line to be colored red.
 https://preview.redd.it/cm7q3dubsg1d1.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5c80073b73d716d1ccac929481c5ff2b3903390
 Then, if I try to commit with that message, I get a notification that "Second line is not empty. Commit anyway? (y or n)", since by convention Git messages should have an empty second line. It gets to the point where: If I want to continue writing my commit message, I have to backspace, then hit C-q SPACE (since SPACE on its own triggers the word wrap behavior), which is a really obnoxious way of typing.
 So my question is: Why does Magit even bother putting the line break in there, if it's just going to complain about that same line break in ten seconds? And can I disable the automatic word wrap, since it's objectively making my commit messages worse and less correct?

 I've finally embarked on the emacs journey as of this year. So far, I'm loving it.. but I'm having some trouble with this specific problem. I'm using CSS modules for a client application, and am defining CSS Variables (--css-variable-name) in global file. I'd like to be able to gain auto completion for these --css-variables. I'm currently using cape / lsp for completion.

 This version introduces new major features and important fixes. Main highlights:
  
kyo-tag: Kyo now has a new type Tag implementation that provides allocation-free sub-type checking. This new solution addresses safety issues with effect handling in generic scopes and its improved performance unblocks some important new features and fixes. A separate artifact kyo-tag is produced with no dependency on any other Kyo modules, enabling the use of the new Tag in isolation by other projects.
 kyo-zio: The initial implementation of the ZIOs effect is included in this new release. It provides a seamless integration between Kyo and ZIO via two methods: ZIOs.get transforms a ZIO computation into a Kyo one, and ZIOs.run transforms Kyo computations into ZIO. These methods can even be used…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's TApir, React, and PostgreSQL for building full-stack web applications. Please find below the guide to help you get started:
  
Guide on Medium: https://medium.com/@jamesjg/introducing-tarp-stack-tapir-react-and-postgresql-3e4c2bbbe22f
 Or full access on LovinData blog: https://lovindata.github.io/blog/2024/04/18/introducing-tarp-stack---tapir-react-and-postgresql/
 The codes: https://github.com/lovindata/blog/tree/main/assets/posts/2
  
This guide answers questions like:
  
How to set up a Scala Tapir backend with a TypeScript React frontend for local development?
 How can my React frontend communicate with my Tapir backend REST API?
 How to serve my React frontend application through the Tapir backend?
 How to build an image for production with an optimized Dockerfile (small and fast to build) using Docker layer caching and multi-stage builds?
  
If these kinds of questions have arisen at any point, or if you are like me—a Data Engineer knowing Scala who wants to build full-stack applications—you should definitely take a look 👍
 I often use this tech stack for prototyping personal projects. At work, I've also used Tapir and PostgreSQL a lot for showing POCs. Initially, my goal was just to have code snippets that I could quickly copy and paste. But why not make it a complete guide so everyone can use it? 🫡
 The guide took up part of my latest one-week vacation (5 days PTO 😭). I didn't expect it to take that long, but it's done now, and I really hope it will be useful to at least one of you! 🙏
 I write monthly on the LovinData Blog and on Medium, and like to give back the knowledge I've learned. So don't hesitate to reach out; I'm always available to chat about nerdy stuff 🤗! Here are my socials: LinkedIn, Twitter and Reddit. Otherwise, let's learn together in the next story 🫡! Bye ❤️.

 This isn't the first time that i make a wayland client without using libwayland, i made it with C, Hare and Typescript(Deno).
 Another day I will improve the program so that it can open a window and draw something in it
 Here is a link to the code, since I would like to know in what aspects could improve the code.

I did so and thought that I had finally reached an understanding with the whole thing... until I was told my understanding was wrong.
 Starting from the beginning: I went to study Functors, most places talking about them just talk about how fmap works, and I understood them as "Anything that has a definition of fmap". 
 The other places talk about it's category theory definition: This, together with me reading that "All Functors in Haskell are actually Endofunctors", made me "click" this exact thought "Wait, if the definition of an Endofunctor is when a category maps to itself, and fmap returns the same typeclass as the one it receives as input, therefore the typeclasses are the categories here and that's why they're called Endofunctors! I got it!".
 So I went to ask people about how a "non-Endo" Functor would be... and that's when I was told that the explanation I came with was wrong: Typeclasses are not "categories" in this context, people say "All Functors in Haskell are actually Endofunctors" because the "category" here (Called Hask) is the set of all types in Haskell (And indeed, all mappings to a type in Haskell yield... a type in Haskell), but that simply destroyed the prior understanding I had and made the word "Functor" meaningless to em again.
 Given that the concept of fmap and Functor are so closely related, is the fact that fmap always returns the same structure as the one of the input it is given (e.g. a fmap with a List will always yield a List, a fmap with an IO monad will always yield an IO monad, a fmap with a Either Monad WON'T EVER yield a Maybe Monad) just a coincidence, having nothing to do with the definition of either a Functor or an Endofunctor?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: Resolved. See my post in the comments section.
 Hey everyone!
 I have a systemd service in .config/systemd/user/ where I start emacs from on boot. The important pieces from that are:
 ``` [Service] Type=notify ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/emacs --fg-daemon
 [Install] WantedBy=default.target ```
 Anyway, it's been great for a long time. I have gnome open up a emacsclient in a new frame when I want to open emacs and boom, it is up instantly.
 The one thing that I didn't realize might be related and I ignored for a long time... When I use xwidget-webkit-browse-url it shows a blank white screen. When I use emacs directly (instead of through an emacsclient from the instance started by systemd), it works properly.
 I get the following error when I do a systemctl --user status emacs:
  May 18 21:30:31 work-dev emacs[3306]: ../../../../../gdk/x11/gdkwindow-x11.c:5653 drawable is not a native X11 window May 18 21:30:31 work-dev emacs[3306]: ../../../../../gdk/x11/gdkwindow-x11.c:5653 drawable is not a native X11 window May 18 21:30:31 work-dev WebKitWebProces[19150]: cannot open display: 
 I assumed that maybe it was an issue where $DISPLAY wasn't set properly so I did M-x setenv and set DISPLAY to :1 (same as what I found from a terminal emulator) and no luck. I also tried WEBKIT_FORCE_SANDBOX=0 and GDK_BACKEND=x11
 Any thoughts? Thanks!

 I'm looking for a TTS elisp package for use with Emacs. Primarily for speaking text from documents stored in Calibre via the calibredb package. It would be an awesome bonus if the TTS was not only able to speak regions but also generate audio files from documents and chapters of documents.
 So far it looks like Piper is the most promising option for an offline TTS. I just need to find some integration points between it and Emacs. 
 thx!

 (use-package dashboard
 :ensure t
 :init
 (setq initial-buffer-choice 'dashboard-open)
 (setq dashboard-set-heading-icons t)
 (setq dashboard-set-file-icons t)
 (setq dashboard-banner-logo-title "Hi XXXXXXXX!")
 (setq dashboard-startup-banner "~/.config/emacs/images/Emacs_512-rescaled2.png")

 (projects . 3)
 (registers . 5)))
 :custom
 (dashboard-modify-heading-icons '((recents . "file-text")
 (bookmarks . "book")))
 :config
 (dashboard-setup-startup-hook))
 I can find nothing wrong here and the code has been working fine previously. If I remove the dashboard code from my config emacs loads just fine. Updating packages has not solved the problem so far. Using 'pkill -USR2 emacs' I get the following backtrace:

 I'm not sure what is going on here. Does anyone know how to solve? If not I will report it. Thx

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: I meant "Gears [is] online". 🤦.
 Sonatype Central. Gears Book.
 I heard about the book a while back, but the library wasn't published.
 //> using scala 3.4.0 //> using dep "ch.epfl.lamp::gears::0.2.0" //> using nativeVersion "0.5.1" import gears.async.* import gears.async.default.given u/main def main() = Async.blocking: val hello = Future: print("Hello") val world = Future: hello.await println(", world!") world.await 
 Now it runs :D
 Btw, I'm not related to the project, and I'm just a user. This is for anyone wanting to play around who also attempted it but didn't want to build it like me.
 On another note... I hate that Async.blocking can be closed with {}, but when I'm using the : syntax, I can't used end, like end Async.blocking or something of the like.
 Async.blocking: ... end Async.blocking 
 ...when the language spoils you so much that you start wondering why it's not 100% perfect.
 To fewerBraces, I'm still not sure if I like you for getting rid of those annoying symbols, or if I am willing to put up with your irregularities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm tinkering with a home made toy LSP server I'm writing myself. I am trying to get it interacting with emacs and have been working with This page from LSP-Mode's website. This is the code I've got in my init.el file. 
 Two small questions. 
 When I launch lsp in a buffer with a .T file lsp-log says command "my_lsp is not present on path" The my_lsp executable is in my .emacs.d/packages/ folder which is added to path at the top of my init file. It isn't advanced enough to require parameters yet. It also executes successfully if I type ./my_lsp in a terminal. It produceses a log file to confirm this. Is that not the path it means? I tried adding it to my Linux path with a source command but it didn't change anything. 
 Second, does the fact that it's in fundamental mode matter if I'm using the regex syntax to add to lsp-language-id-config? By using regex I thought I understood that the mode didn't matter because I'm defining it by file extension instead. Any help clarifying this would be very helpful. Thanks
 (with-eval-after-load 'lsp-mode (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(".*\\.T$" . "T")) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection "my_lsp") :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on "T") :server-id 'my_lsp)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HVM2 is a runtime for high-level languages like Haskell and Python. It is like Haskell's STG, and could, one day, be an alternative runtime that GHC targets. After years of hard work and polish, with emphasis on correctness, it is finally production ready. And it runs on GPUs now!
 Unfortunately, we do not compile Haskell to it yet. Turns out such project is much harder than I anticipated, and we don't have the scale to do it yet. There are still no brackets/croissants, as the performance impact of these is too harsh to keep it practical. I'll keep working hard to make it happen one day.
 I'm posting this because it might interest one of you. The new atomic linking algorithm on HVM2's paper is beautiful and I think some of you will enjoy. Please do delete the thread if you think it is off-topic here. HVM2 is written in Rust. We only use Haskell directly on Kind's new checker, but it isn't released yet. :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backwards is a way to run Applicative actions in backwards order.
 I decided to try if you could define a Monad backwards, but with a MonadFix constraint: 
 instance MonadFix m => Monad (Backwards m) where (>>=) :: forall a b. Backwards m a -> (a -> Backwards m b) -> Backwards m b (>>=) = coerce bind where bind :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b bind as next = mdo b <- next a a <- as pure b 
 I think it's pretty much useless, but who knows. I was able to run an example that is actually an Applicative instance, since the computations are independent. 
 -- >> conversation putStrLn readLn -- Hello A -- < 100 -- Hello B -- < 200 -- Hello C -- = (100,200) conversation :: Monad m => (String -> m ()) -> m Int -> m (Int, Int) conversation say getInt = do say "Hello A" n <- getInt say "Hello B" m <- getInt say "Hello C" pure (n, m) -- >> conversationBackwards putStrLn readLn -- Hello C -- < 100 -- Hello B -- < 200 -- Hello A -- = (200,100) conversationBackwards :: forall m. MonadFix m => (String -> m ()) -> m Int -> m (Int, Int) conversationBackwards = coerce do conversation @(Backwards m) 
 Adding a dependency, not surprisingly, gives me: Exception: cyclic evaluation in fixIO.

 Very new to Haskell and I'm trying to do real-world things with it, maybe too soon. I have this short program
 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} module Substances where import qualified Control.Exception as E import Data.Aeson.Parser.Internal import Data.Aeson.Types import Data.ByteString import Network.HTTP.Simple getSubstancesJson :: IO (Response ByteString) getSubstancesJson = httpBS "https://api.fda.gov/other/substance.json?limit=1" getResults :: IO () getResults = do E.bracket resp onError $ \body -> do let json_ = eitherDecodeStrictWith jsonEOF ifromJSON body case json_ of (Right j) -> putStrLn j Left (path, err) -> putStrLn ("Error " <> show err <> " at " <> show path) where json = getSubstancesJson resp = getResponseBody <$> json onError = const $ getResponseStatusCode <$> json 
 This compiles and runs but it shows that the path is an empty list. The error message is "expected String but encountered Object". I know this data source produces valid JSON and I'm wondering where I am going wrong and how I might get a more descriptive error here. Also general style critiques are much appreciated. Thanks everyone in advance, this is a really cool language and I'm excited to finally learn!

 It seems like this is a recurring question but it is just really confusing and I need some guidance. 
 I just want to hone my haskell programming skills meaning that whenever I find exercises or puzzles I will look for modules that implement functions I can use without having to write em myself. These packages aren't in base. For example on hackage I found digits. 
 In python i would just create a venv, pip install away and trash the entire environment when done, leaving me with a clean global installation. 
 Reading about cabal and messing with it ever so slightly I am already afraid that everything is about to go to hell. I read about hsenv and how supposedly it is kinda the same (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsenv) so I guess I can use that and just cabal install --lib away there but havent tried it yet.
 How do you guys do this? How do you mess around and experiment with non-base modules after which you remove what is unnecessary leaving you with a clean system? I just want to write some basic scripts, maybe at some point write some larger applications. Every single time I get drawn back in again (it is all for my own benefit, i am not required to learn haskell) I am met with this exact same nonsense where I just blank out and ditch it because my global installation gets f*cked. I am sick of it! I love the language! Have so for years! Help me love this tooling by telling me how you handle it!
 Edit: for the record i have everything installed using ghcup, i am also fairly familiar writing haskell code. I just want to know how everybody goes around writing basic scripts without initializing an entire project if you just need 50 LOC for some leetcode or advent of code puzzle.

 I have lots of individually customized :background color specs in my init file; should I just defconst theme-dark-p and use that everywhere to adjust my custom colors, or should I go all in and hook into the theming infrastructure rather than just (set-face-attribute ... nil :background #0d5)?

 Company-mode is very slow since I enabled whitespace-mode, I would like to ask for your help to optimize it.
 This is the code for whitespace-mode:
 (use-feature whitespace :defer 2 :diminish (global-whitespace-mode) :custom (whitespace-line-column 80) (whitespace-global-modes '(not shell-mode eshell-mode help-mode magit-mode magit-diff-mode ibuffer-mode dired-mode occur-mode)) (whitespace-action '(cleanup auto-cleanup)) (whitespace-style '(face trailing tabs spaces newline missing-newline-at-eof empty indentation space-after-tab space-before-tab space-mark tab-mark newline-mark)) :config (global-whitespace-mode +1)) 
 This is the code for company-mode:
 (use-package company :diminish (company-mode) :defer 2 :preface (setq tab-always-indent 'complete completion-cycle-threshold 3) :custom (company-idle-delay 0.5) (company-show-quick-access t) (company-minimum-prefix-length 2) (company-tooltip-limit 10) (company-tooltip-flip-when-above t) (company-tooltip-align-annotations t) ;; EXP (company-require-match nil) (company-global-modes '(not erc-mode message-mode eshell-mode)) ;; (company-tooltip-annotation-padding 1) ;; (company-format-margin-function 'company-text-icons-margin) ;; (company-text-icons-add-background t) (company-files-exclusions '(".git/" ".DS_Store" "node_modules/")) (company-dabbrev-other-buffers 'all) (company-dabbrev-downcase nil) (company-dabbrev-minimum-length 2) ;; (company-transformers '(delete-consecutive-dups ;; company-sort-by-occurrence)) :config (global-company-mode +1))

Cabal-3.12.0.0 released! by Francesco Ariis
The Cabal team is happy to announce the release of Cabal the library version 3.12.0.0.
Cabal exact printing by Jappie J. T. Klooster
For a long time, I’ve been annoyed that cabal tells you to add modules to your cabal file. It’s can of detect missing modules, but won’t automatically add them. This is not a big deal for a single module, but if you like splitting code into many small modules, for example because you like fast compile times, then any refactor may cause many of these messages to appear, which becomes tedious to manage.

The first one is that if I quit dirvish with q and then call it again, it forgets what folder I was last at. Is it possible to make it stay "in the background" in the folder I have it.
 The second issue is I'd like something like ranger's tabs you can switch with <TAB>. This is particularly useful when copying from one folder to another.

I am very interested in this language but unfortunately I have not been able to find a proper environment to develop scala projects. I have tried Eclipse and failed because as soon as I install the necessary plugin for scala, the IDE no longer launches, I have tried installing Metals on Vs code, and it just fails to connect with the build server apparently, I can't afford Intellij and I think using the online sites is not an option for my project(too many files parallel programming etc.) and using the command line is out of the question (too much hassle, will definitely have trouble debugging, writing the code). I would like to have a program for development instead. Can anyone please help me out here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I tried to configure <tab> keybinding to have different behavior in different scenarios. In order to do this I wrote my custom function|
 ```lisp (defun vd/tab-indent-or-complete () "Function to choose correct TAB action." (interactive) (cond ((derived-mode-p 'org-mode) (org-cycle)) ((derived-mode-p 'minibuffer-mode) (minibuffer-complete)) (t (progn (when (fboundp 'tempel-complete) (tempel-expand)) (indent-for-tab-command)))))
 (define-key global-map (kbd "<tab>") 'vd/tab-indent-or-complete) ```
 In org mode and in regular buffers this works as expected, but in minibuffer it acts very weird. If I type Alt-x, I get minibuffer with vertico interface, but when I type <tab> word Completion appiers instead of M-x and until I press C-g it "override" M-x minibuffer. If I press <tab> again it creates more Completion buffers(in picture Completion [2] change to Completion [4]) and I need to close them with C-g.

 TL;DR: my CONSULT-LINE is case-sensitive which is why I sometimes don't find stuff because of capitalisation. (How) can I change that?
 I am falling in love with the capacities of CONSULT as of late (especially when combining its results with EMBARK-EXPORT, holy moly!). However, I noticed that I can't find stuff if it is capitalised or in allcaps. This is not good, because I thus overlook stuff I'd want to find in a buffer.
 I tried tweaking ISEARCH-related variables, but to no apparent avail. I also tried delving into the source code, but I did not really understand how CONSULT-LINE produces its results.
 Can you tell me which variables I need to tweak for consult-line to be case-insensitive when searching?
 Have a good day, fellows :)

 Not exactly an emacs post, but one that can be useful to those running emacs under OS X.
 if you use hammerspoon, I wrote a function that might be useful to others to quickly go to emacs wherever you are.
 The idea is that whenever I press my own prefix (C-M-c):
 If I am in emacs, things happen as usual.
 If I am not in emacs, the pressed keys are never seen by the current app, instead, the last active window of emacs gets raised, and the sequence gets sent to emacs.
 my prefix has (sub)commands for org-agenda, org-capture, mu4e, etc. so it is easy to start executing them without first finding emacs.

language, if only because we love to write about it now and then
(if not, you can start with our introductory series, although
it’s not required for this post). Nickel ships with a language server, often
abusively called LSP, which is the piece of software answering various
requests emitted from your code editor, such as auto-completion,
go-to-definition, error diagnostics, and so on. In this post, I want to explore
how a new and long-awaited feature of the Nickel language server (NLS) which
landed in the 1.5 version, live contracts checking, turns out to enable a new
powerful paradigm for developer experience: the programmable LSP.

 whether tis nobler in the mind to ssh to a remote, projecting an emacs back through a tunnel,
 or to browse the files remotely via nfs or use tramp-ssh to edit them.
 To browse, to view, to view, perhaps to edit, aye, there's the rub.
 For if when editing remotely, when one also edits locally,
 when we have lost track of what we're doing, or indeed what user we are,
 when we have lost efficiency for the sake of convenience,

 If there're by chance any GMs that know any outstanding non-org apps for this purpose they can suggest, those would be cool too!

I've been using iOS and Siri with some success so far, but I still want Org on the 'backend' for the granularity in organization, ease of adding and manipulating properties, capturing stuff while at a keyboard etc. 
 I'm asking because I've been away-from-keyboard lately, and so my only hope to keep up with stuff is voice commands. I don't want to abandon Org completely though and see a lot of value in it for organizing my stuff more thoroughly and it helps me think through stuff and complete longer term projects in a way I don't see iOS tools doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I want to store lots of data in lists, thousands of lists perhaps. But I'm guessing it would be bad to associate each of these storage lists with its own defvar (setq) symbol. Could I simply do something like this
 #+name: 05283a07-3c44-4f64-8629-f0b8fbc7d214 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never (list 'floor (list 'front 'kitchen 'hall 'br1 'br2)) #+end_src 
 or just
 #+name: 05283a07-3c44-4f64-8629-f0b8fbc7d214 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never '(floor (living kitchen hall br1 br2)) #+end_src 
 and have them scattered in an org-mode file where I need them. Then I could tangle them
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never :tangle floordata.el :noweb yes <<05283a07-3c44-4f64-8629-f0b8fbc7d214>> ... #+end_src 
 Sure, I could do this, then all these lists would be in the file floordata.el. But then they're all symbol-less. Is there a way (I heard there is) to make a hash table out of these lists with a symbol name attached to each? It would be great to have symbol name (defvar, setq) given to each list, but that would bog down if I were to create thousands of these things, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a bit lost of how this things interact. I will describe what I want to make first
  
Use pylsp through eglot,
 Have a virtual enviroment for each python project,
 Be able to manage the enviroments through emacs (tried poetry and pipenv),
 Have the linting, lsp, jedi, black, flake8, ruff, etc installed out of my project venvs, as some of these are shared with others.
 Have it easy to change, or automatic between enviroments when I change projects.
  
I have tried some things (pipenv, virtualenvwrapper and poetry), but it ends up breaking when I try to isolate projects. It sort of worked when I had everything installed directly on debian, when I tested things with a fresh install, but not if I try to leave the system packages alone, as one should do with python and have venvs for each project.
 What happend most often is that eglot/pylsp did not recognize the installed packages in the venvs, I tried to install pylsp in one "general" venv, I it worked well, untill I realized that I did not have the projects in enviroments (I had created several accidentally with poetry and venvwrapper at the same time, and neither of those where active when developing), and the dependencies where a mess as result.
 So I ask in general what would be the best practice to keep things clean?, and in more detail:
  
where to install the lsp and other IDE packages,
 how to make emacs aware of the enviroments to manage them, 
 know what enviroment I'm in, 
 be able to change enviroment,
 install packages to the enviroment.
 
 How to make eglot understand that the project has its own enviroment and should recognise the installed packages in the enviroment?

 Below is my code Note that the flatMap continues to be added and the indent deepens to find the ImagePullBackOff pod.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm just learning haskell, and I'm trying to add an external package for pretty much the first time. I wanted something to parse s-expressions, so I searched for that and came across this package (and basically nothing else): https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sexp-0.7
 I wanted to use this package, so I added it to my .cabal file (I'm using cabal-install), ran cabal update, and tried to build my program. After trying to build the package for some time, I got an error:
 src/Data/Sexp.hs:4:14: warning: [-Wdeprecated-flags] -XOverlappingInstances is deprecated: instead use per-instance pragmas OVERLAPPING/OVERLAPPABLE/OVERLAPS | 4 | {-# LANGUAGE OverlappingInstances, ViewPatterns #-} | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [1 of 4] Compiling Data.Sexp ( src/Data/Sexp.hs, dist/build/Data/Sexp.o, dist/build/Data/Sexp.dyn_o ) src/Data/Sexp.hs:200:25: error: [GHC-76037] Not in scope: type constructor or class ‘NoSelector’ Suggested fix: Perhaps use ‘Selector’ (imported from GHC.Generics) | 200 | instance IsRecord (M1 S NoSelector f) False | ^^^^^^^^^^ Error: cabal: Failed to build sexp-0.7 (which is required by exe:sexp from sexp-0.7). See the build log above for details. 
 More important than this particular error, I'm just trying to figure out if I'm doing the right thing. Can you just find a package on hackage and install it, or do you have to check for compatibility first? In this case, the package hasn't been updated in 7 years, but I was unable to learn that from hackage--I had to go look at its github page. I'm guessing the age is a problem, but I just don't have a sense of how to find packages and determine whether they'll be compatible with my setup.
 For reference, I'm running ghc version 9.6.5 in a nix develop shell. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is pretty trivial, but as someone starting out learning Haskell and with very little coding experience in general, I thought I'd share this solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem in the CIS194 homework. I just had that "aha" moment with functional programming working on this when I realized what "defining" vs "doing" really means. To be clear, when I say "defining" I mean saying what a value is, as opposed to "doing", that is, going through the computational steps, procedural style. Anyway, here's my solution.
 type Peg = String type Move = (Peg, Peg) hanoi :: Integer -> Peg -> Peg -> Peg -> [Move] hanoi 0 _ _ _ = [] hanoi 1 a b _ = [(a, b)] hanoi x start goal temp = hanoi (x - 1) start temp goal ++ (start, goal) : hanoi (x - 1) temp goal start 
 I'm sure there are problems with my solution, and this definitely isn't something that would be difficult to implement in a procedural style, but when I was first attempting this problem I was creating structures to keep track of where each disc was and what the size of each disc was, and seeing this solution I just got really excited, so I thought I'd share it :) thanks for reading all this if you did btw

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a little bit of background, I'm working on a language for doing first order logic. The ast is just an instance of a pretty big recursive data type.
 While developing the language, I've ended up needing to write a bunch of functions that all boil down to recursively modifying a couple of the constructors, while leaving the rest untouched. (Eg, turning every "Implies a b" into "Or (Not a) b" while leaving everything else untouched).
 Not every constructor has the same shape, so there isn't an easy way to use wildcards while keeping the function recursive, and so to avoid writing a bunch of nearly identical recursive calls (elimImp (Not a) = Not (elimImp a)) for every function, I wrote an operator Ive been calling $$ that threads a function through every recursive constructor, and then elimImp can just be a case statement that only does its job, and then is the identity otherwise, and doesnt have to worry about keeping the recursion going. 
 This thingy, $$, isn't exactly map, and isn't exactly apply, even though it's clearly similar to both. I am assuming it's a fairly common operation to perform on recursive data structures, but I don't know what I would be called. What exactly have I written? I'm actively trying to learn the basics of type/category theory, so please don't shy away from details!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Texinfo is better than any documentation system (sphinx, mkdocs, doxygen, ...). The ability to search quickly in terminal or in emacs is much better than the switching back and forth in the browser. The index search is amazing unlike the other documentations system which are painfully slow. The question left is why it didn't take off? why it's not popular? very few projects use it!

Emacs
 Emacs (Client)
  
That's fine, I understand why they're there. But since then, I installed the algebraic geometry software Macaulay2 with
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:macaulay2/macaulay2 sudo apt install macaulay2 
 I noticed that some stuff related to Emacs seemed to be installed along with this program. Now, when I type "emacs" in the search, I see
  
Emacs
 Emacs (Client)
 Emacs (GUI)
 Emacs (Terminal)
 Emacs (Client)
  
I don't like that. I've been learning how to use Emacs for the past week and I want to keep it as simple as possible. What's going on, do I have multiple Emacs versions installed in my system? When I do apt list -a emacs it only returns
 emacs/noble,now 1:29.3+1-1ubuntu2 all [installed,automatic] 
 How do I go back to how it was before?
 Any help is appreciated.

 Could you share with me yours copy paste workflow.
 Here is my workflow:
 I select half of the first line and push the M-w to copy this half line.
 I select half of the second line and my plan is to change it with the previously copied text.
 So I select the half of the second line and I push the yank-pop related shortcut and I use the arrow key to go down to the second line and push the enter key to copy the previously copied text to this place.
 What is yours workflow for this simple text manipulation ?
 Do you have an elisp code what is changing this basic behavior (to copy the region before the paste) ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a /very/ long time happy user of eight megs and constantly swapping, but recenty, I wonder if there has been a trend upward in latency.
 I use it exclusively for programming python, so jedi-LSP. or pyright with eglot, with minimal fancy extensions.
 But it just feels sluggish; this on a modern Intel MBP and also M2 MBP. 
 I wonder if I am imagining things, or if folks are tracking latency and have numbers to back me up / shoot me down. 
 By latency, I mean simple scrolling, cursor movement; when I invoke cross-ref operations I expect some latency just to open new buffer, so that isn't important. 
 As an eaxmple, I think my C-n move-next-line speed is +- 5 lines per second, and Zed on the same machine, same codebase is +- 20.

📢 We are excited to announce ScalikeJDBC 4.3, introducing a new OR mapper named scalikejdbc-orm!
 If you're a fan of ActiveRecord from Rails, this will surely appeal to you!
 Check the document now: https://scalikejdbc.org/documentation/orm.html #Scala #Database #ActiveRecord
  
The release notes https://github.com/scalikejdbc/scalikejdbc/blob/master/notes/4.3.0.markdown
  
ScalikeJDBC 4.3.0 is now available for Scala 2.12, 2.13, and Scala 3 application development!
 The notable feature enhancement is scalikejdbc-orm module addition! This extension is an O/R mapper built on top of the ScalikeJDBC core library, drawing significant inspiration from Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord library. For instance, you can run the following query just with simple CRUDMapper class/object definition:
 ...
 Thank you to all the contributors for this release! 👍
 * u/jchyb helped u/seratch resolve Scala 3 compilation errors for scalikejdbc-orm module (#1249)
 * u/kardapoltsev resolved missing tags in one-to-x queries (#2163)
 * u/xuwei-k did a substantial amount of work for refactoring and dependency management

 "Dynamic notes", what I mean by that, is for example I want to have a list with all notes containing a certain property, like todo or something.
 In obsidian there is the dataview plugin with which I can embed said querie into my note and get a List of notes.
 Is there any way to achive that in org-mode? The important part is the embeding.

 This one works as expected

 The latter one shows me all files regardless of the file extension. The first one shows me all files except *.txt.
 I'm using git 2.24.1 and on bash command line it works. Can somebody reproduce this behavior?
 I know that I further narrow the results with
 #hello#\.txt
 But this also looks for \.txt in the grep results and not only the file names.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the very few things I currently cannot do from Emacs is to chat with the subset of my friends who use Signal or WhatsApp. I spent an hour or so trying to set up a bridge to these services via beeper.com. It works fine with a Matrix client like Element, but I cannot get it to work with ement. I do see the messages, but they are all encrypted.
 The ement manual mentions the pantalaimon daemon as a way to get encrypted room support, but even after setting it up and connecting with (ement-connect :uri-prefix "http://localhost:8009") the messages are still encrypted.
 Here's my pantalaimon config:
 [local-matrix] Homeserver = https://matrix.beeper.com ListenAddress = localhost ListenPort = 8009 UseKeyring = false SSL = false 
 I can confirm that pantalaimon is correctly configured because I am able to read all my messages from Element using http://localhost:8009 as the host.
 I don't understand if I am misunderstanding something or if it is just not possible to use ement in this way. I would appreciate any help or pointers in the right direction.
 (I thought about posting this as a GitHub issue but I don't want to bother the maintainer with a support request.)

 I'm creating a new Emacs config from scratch and get into some issues with TAB when Corfu is enabled. When I'm at the begging of a line, or I'm in a space, I expect that TAB intend to the next TAB line, but unfortunately, it isn't work.
 Does this is a known issue? There is any workaround that I can add to my config?
 If needed, you can take a look at my Corfu configs here: https://gitlab.com/gil0mendes/dotfiles/-/blob/main/config/emacs/g0m-emacs-modules/g0m-emacs-completion.el?ref_type=heads#L96-112 But this file is just a small part of a literal configuration.

 Eventually, I'd like to put it up on Melpa and add support for executing apptainer commands. However, while I've used emacs for years, I haven't done much in Elisp besides tweaking my config file. Constructive criticism, suggestions, etc., are very welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to make a package, mostly for myself, where I could have a bunch of org files that I would use as templates for projects.
 Let's say you want to create a C project. The org file would contain code blocks with a basic hello world file in the src folder, and a basic Makefile or something. The package could also be asked to create a git repo or whatever else you want. You would then call a function, select one of the project templates, be prompted for any optional argument the template may have (like libraries maybe) and create the project structure by tangling the source blocks.
 I managed to make this work, but I hit quite a bothersome snag in the road.
 Makefiles NEED tabs to work. And org discards tabs when tangling, replacing them with 4 spaces.
 I have no way to make this work seamlessly. I can set org-src-preserve-indentation but that makes it so the two space margin added to source block for styling is also included in the final file, so I need to make them all not have this margin, which sucks.
 It also means I need a way to set this variable not only when tangling, but also when editing so org doesn't discard the tab there as well. I made it a file local variable, but it's considered risky so you are prompted to apply it, which is annoying as hell.
 This thing just killed my idea, because I don't like the compromises just for ONE single file type.
 BTW I do know of skeletor's existence, but I think it tries to do too much and ends up being quite bothersome, constantly needing external tools, and not even using built in features like completing-read, and instead rolling its own.

 (defface my-face-for-list-bullet '((t :background "red")) "Face for bluuet of plain list") (font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode '(("^\\([0-9]+[.)]\\|\\+\\|\\-\\) " 1 'my-face-for-list-bullet)) 'append) 
 It works fine, but it only changes the item marker in the beginning of each line. What I want is to change the color of the whole line. I tried to change the regex:
 (font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode '(("^ *[-].+" 'my-face-for-list-bullet)) 'append) 
 But it doesn't work. The regex works in re-builder just fine, so I really don't understand why it's not working here. I've already tried use font-lock-add-keywords other times, but it seems it never works.
 Thanks.

 Release notes:
  
This release fixes potential bugs.
 The hash that Stack uses to distinguish one build plan from another has changed for plans that set (as opposed to unset) manually Cabal flags for immutable dependencies. This will cause Stack to rebuild dependencies for such plans.
  
Changes since v2.15.5:
 Major changes:
  
Stack 2.15.5 and earlier cannot build with Cabal (the library) version 3.12.0.0. Stack can now build with that Cabal version.
  
Behavior changes:
  
Stack’s StackSetupShim executable, when called with repl and stack-initial-build-steps, no longer uses Cabal’s replHook to apply initialBuildSteps but takes a more direct approach.
  
Bug fixes:
  
Fix a regression introduced in Stack 2.15.1 that caused a ‘no operation’ stack build to be slower than previously.
 The hashes that Stack uses to distinguish one build plan from another now include the Cabal flags for immutable dependencies set manually. Previously, in error, only such flags that were unset manually were included.
  
Thanks to all our contributors for this release:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see a bunch of guidance on using nix with Haskell online, but much it seems old and outdated. Is there any current guidance on this available? Is using stack with nix integration enabled and a shell.nix file still recommended? Is using a flake with nix develop an option (I know I can use nix to install ghc with a bunch of extra haskell libraries, but I don’t know how to then access those libraries, since a build system would presumably want to install them itself).
 Honestly, I’d be okay with just using stack normally, but inside a nix develop shell, if that’s possible. I am on NixOS, so some amount of nix interaction is necessary I’m sure. 
 Thanks.

 Contacting host elpa.gnu.org:443 hangs forever.
 You want to refresh your packages, or install a new one, and this is what happens.
 Well, yesterday I have been sifting all day through these help forums, all the while trying from time to time to install a package from elpa, and had no success (not even in understanding what was the issue).
 Today, early morning, I gave it one last try, and... there you go! It all went smoothly, no glitches.
 EDIT: Don't take this too seriously.
 EDIT: In my "research" I noted that one recurring answer was "be patient, elpa.gnu.org is known to be slow some times", and this is my experience as well (starting at least in 2020) so I was wondering how much this is common knowledge.
 EDIT: I am not bringing forward that it actually goes down on Saturday!!! That was just to underline the unpredictability of this thing.

I am loving the outlining features of org-mode and have been looking for a program that can move sections around since early 80's, when I had one for the PC (PC Outliner?).
 Also on Obsidian I used the "one long file" approach for recording daily thoughts, journaling, etc. Seems like org-mode would do this as well. Any suggestions for resources for writers using org-mode?

 Therefore I ported julia-vterm.el to support python with only minor tweaks to make it play nicely with environment variables. All credit belongs to the original author though.
 EDIT: added spyder-like code cell support.
 EDIT: I was unaware of the original author's effort :P and have now cherry-picked/synced what was done there. I guess I'll either give it back to the maintainer of julia-vterm or let it diverge happily while dogfooding it for the next few months.

 But when I run this code without any directives, it still compiles and runs fine. What am I missing? is FlexibleInstances not nedded anymore? and if it is, for which cases is it needed now? Thank you!

Beside info about how to install lsp or other utilities for langs not already commented in my init.el i am struggling with projects, buffers, workspaces ecc. Fact is if i open treemacs and close it (killing buffers, using M-x close etc) it always opens on a previous "project" what id like to do is close those so called projects and also tell treemacs to open in current working directory (the root of the file im editing at the Moment). Can you give me general advise on how to manage this kind of workflow in doom? i know little about nvim (used nvchad s bit) but i know vim keybinds. Also do you rather use vterm or a terminal outside emacs? (i'm using emacs launching it as emacsclient -c -a 'emacs')

However, could the new context function mechanism be used to simplify coding using existing effect systems like C-E? I'm not sufficiently au-fait with this Scala 3 feature to try this out myself, but if someone could do a Gist or suchlike to show this, that would be very interesting. For sure, the current typical C-E "for-comp-of-dooom" isn't so neat really...

 I'm just looking for alternatives as I'm burned out on imperative programming (after Georgia Tech OMSCS). 
 Web still seems to be where the jobs are so I want to do everything in pure functional programming languages (Elixir seems popular but watching a video looked a bit too magical). I've also tried Elm which I like but it's frontend only so was thinking Elm frontend and Haskell backend but if I can stick to one language for the full stack I'd rather do that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Emacs veterans,
 I encountered a situation like the following. I am working on a project and a tool is used when building the project. The tool requires me to add a line in my `.bashrc` which `source` a script file that does something and source another three files. This means without sourcing the file, that tool is not usable from command line and I can't build the project. Recently, I am learning to use "compile" command of Emacs to work on this project. I found because that tool needs that sourcing of the script, I can't simply make use of the tool with "compile" command.
 One possibility is to dig through all the scripts involved, figured out what they do, and somehow set them up manually in some fixed way, but this would be a tedious work, also, it'd be not reliable after I upgrade the tool in the future.
 Currently, my solution is that I use `bash -i -c 'the_tool params..'` instead of `the_tool params...`. Although this works for me for the case at the moment, it's not very handy, and I wonder what the better solutions out there that experienced Emacs users will do.
 It seems I can also make Emacs source my `.bashrc` when Emacs starts, but I am not sure if I want to source `.bashrc` every time my Emacs loads, because this tool is only needed for doing a particular type of project development.
 I wonder what would you guys do for this situation. Thanks in advance for you input.
 P. S. I didn't say the name of the tool with an intention that I want to know ways to deal with this as a general situation, instead of learning for example, that a package exists that is for this tool for this situation.

 I want emacs-eat's semi-char mode to not send the key M-o to the terminal and instead pass it to Emacs (I use it to switch windows instead of the clumsy C-x o).
 I tried doing this
  (add-to-list 'eat-semi-char-non-bound-keys (vector meta-prefix-char ?o)) (eat-update-semi-char-mode-map) 
 which seems to correctly set the variable eat-semi-char-mode-map to not have M-o bound to eat-self-input, but then M-o still gets passed to the terminal when I press it!
 After some searching, I found the code
  (define-minor-mode eat--semi-char-mode "Minor mode for semi-char mode keymap." :interactive nil :keymap eat-semi-char-mode-map) 
 In eat.el where the map is used. I found out that if I redefine the minor mode after changing the keymap, my key binding works as expected (M-o get passed to Emacs instead of the terminal).
 What's the reason for this? I thought that the minor mode should have a dynamic keymap based on the variable eat-semi-char-mode-map, but it seems that I need to redefine the minor mode for the changes to take effect.

Nevertheless, a formal, taxonomic dimension is, obviously, also not completely absent. When I branch of from 1a into 1a1, it also normally means, that 1a1 (and 1a2,...) provides analysis of greater details of 1a1, which now becomes the main context for all the children. It does not only mean that I got back to the topic of 1a later, while I had made notes about different topics in 1b and 1c in between. Thus, it seems to me there is a playful tension between a formal structure (topic, subtopic, detail and so forth) …]]></summary>

I just had a vision of a Transient menu, that would let you choose Avy targets and actions separately. Like, select target "word" and then select either "goto", "kill", "copy" etc.
 So I'm curious if anyone's made an Avy menu like that, or in any other way!

 Suppose I have (in an org-mode file):
 * A ** a1 ** TODO a2 * B ** b1 
 If I narrow the buffer using C-x n s (narrow to subtree) on "B", and then run C-c a t to get an agenda buffer with all the todo items, this agenda buffer will show me only "TODO a2", regardless of the fact that the buffer is narrowed do subtree "B", which is correct. But when I try to kill this "TODO a2" item in the agenda buffer using C-k, org-mode kills "b1" instead.
 Is this a bug or is there some variable to configure here? I've updated my Emacs recently, and I remember that in the previous version (26), whenever I called the agenda the narrowing would automatically be undone, and this problem didn't occur.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first came across the idea of Zettelkasten probably 2-3 years ago. I was intrigued, and spent some time reading and researching about it, but I just couldn't visualize how it actually worked.
Then last fall I was helping my wife find a replacement for Evernote for her recipes, and discovered Obsidian. (It was more than she needed, she went with SimpleNote) but I was intrigued by the idea of linked notes. I downloaded it, watched some videos and started putting stuff in it. I had used various programs before, but they ended up just becoming archives of stuff, and not really useful for production of ideas. I'm working to not fall in that trap this time.
Probably the two most helpful things for me have been Sonke Ahren's book and a few videos by Morgan Eau on YouTube. This is a great place to start 
I am going back to school after retiring, entering a doctorate program. That's a bit intimidating at 53. I've got a couple of masters, but it's been a while. I'm really hoping using Zettelkasten principles in Obsidian will aid me in my endeavor.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to figure out how to use org-mode and org-brain together as data management. The extension of the org-mode headings hierarchy into a graph (parent-child-friend) with org-brain is great for me. But now I'm needing something very data-intensive, in my case I need to create an inventory which will easily have thousands of items. I am working for an apartment complex and I need a way to inventory all the fixed and non-fixed assets. I don't want to just go with a relational database or even a spreadsheet. Yes, org-mode/brain is text- and file-based, so each inventory item will be a separate file or heading in a file, but I don't want even more separate files and/or headings for each inventory item's details. One idea I had was to create a lisp defvar symbol for each inventory item (e.g., screens, garden hose, picnic table, etc.) and have a list (a-/p-) assigned to the variable with additional info, e.g., '((size xxx) (count 10)...). But then I've got a huge amount of global variables going on in an Emacs session. This seems impractical, but, hey, I've seen crazy data management stuff done in Emacs lisp.
 Another idea is to do the items as org-mode/brain files or headings, then put item details in an org-mode table -- and rely on the whole org table ecosystem. Another idea is have item details in a custom drawer in a file or under a heading. Another is have very broad inventory categories as variables, then attach huge lists of lists of lists to each variable. (e.g., custom-set-variables in my init file with hundreds of lists.) In general, the Lisp world is wont to leverage the abstract syntax tree, and org-element is there to help with that. But where does my situation fit in, is my question.

Compiling higher order functions with GADTs by Srijan
Implementing first class functions in a bytecode interpreter is trivial. But how do compilers that generate machine code (or lower to C, or SSA) implement higher order functions? Back in 2021, I found an answer when contributing closures to the Pallene compiler. Today I was researching something loosely related, and found yet another neat trick called defunctionalization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to set up desktop mode. It works in "normal" standalone emacs mode, but when I am in client/daemon mode, I cannot load the desktop in a new frame.
 This is the relevant part of my config:
 ;(desktop-save-mode 1)
 (setq desktop-path (list user-emacs-directory))
 (setq desktop-dirname user-emacs-directory)
 (setq desktop-base-file-name "emacs-desktop")
 (setq desktop-load-locked-desktop t)
 Note that turned of desktop-save-mode for now and am just trying to do it manually, to exclude another source of errors.
 The command 'desktop-save-in-desktop-dir' seems to work fine, and if I restart the emacs server and then connect an emacs client and do "desktop-read", I get my desktop back.
 But if I just close the emacs client and keep the server running, if I reopen another client and do "desktop-read", I get the error (?):
 "Not reloading the desktop; already loaded"
 Any ideas? Thanks!

 Also what is the best way to load the right virtualenv? I'm a simple man I use venv or virtualenvwrapper to create the environments
 Pyvenv doesn't seem to do it... I don't care if the solution is lines in my config or a file per project base

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love org mode and I love vim bindings which I get from evil. So far so good. The thing is, that's pretty much all I really need/want. So, I feel like I have this super complex piece of software for something that shouldn't require it.
 What's the problem with that you ask? Well, it just seems like whenever I have to do anything slightly outside of my normal routine it's a lot more work and complexity to figure out than I want. I'm busy and I just don't have a lot of time to tinker. Some people do which is great, but not me. 
 For org mode all I really need is folding. Folding and the ability to move levels of folding around easily. Is there something like this that works well with markdown or something that would make more sense for me? I used VIM for years, maybe it's worth another try? 
 This isn't a complaint, Emacs is really cool. I'm just wondering if I should stick with it.

When I tried package-refresh-contents, I got a "can't check signature: No public key" error. So I've gone down the reddit/stack overflow/google rabbit hole but nothing I've tried has worked. 
 2 weeks ago I installed Mint and emacs on my desktop and everything worked fine. Both installs of Mint are from the same iso on the same thumb drive. I installed both emacs from the Software Manager, so they're both 27.2. I'm at my wit's end here. I'd love to leave Windows behind but this kind of thing is a major obstacle for me. Any suggestions welcome!

 By now I've used a lot of cl-lib, seq, map, as well as dash.
 Here's the thing. Usually, I want a codebase to be consistent and use the minimum vocabulary. Basically "pick a library and stick with it", instead of mixing and matching.
 Seq/map can go a long way, but eventually without fail I'll arrive at a situation where I think "ok, the vastly most elegant way to express this is with an --iterate", or something. So now I have one dash invocation, and may as well factor out all uses of seq. So today, I don't even start using seq anymore because I know I will have to factor it out anyway.
 Dash always wins in the end. The only real contender is cl-lib, and if you pair it with llama, it can ev…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a piece of software that transforms a piece of data through several states. To make sure data is only passed to steps in the right state, it is encoded in the type system. Additionally, in different states, parts of the data may have different types. For example (assume DataKinds and TypeFamilies):
 data State = A | B | C type family Foo (s :: State) where Foo 'A = String Foo 'B = [Int] Foo 'C = String data Bar (s :: State) = Bar { x :: Int, y :: Foo s } 
 Now, even though Foo 'A and Foo 'C are equal, and we can have
 atoc :: Foo 'A -> Foo 'C atoc = id 
 we can't have
 atoc' :: Bar 'A -> Bar 'C atoc' = id 
 This makes sense to me, and I wouldn't want id to be a valid implementation anyway since the whole point of having the state in the type is that data in different states is not equal. That said, it would be nice if there was a way of coercing Bar 'A to Bar 'C. We can use record update syntax to assign y to itself, i.e.
 atoc'' :: Bar 'A -> Bar 'C atoc'' b = b { y = y b } 
 but is there really no other way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a library prairie that allows you to work with record fields as regular values. There's a lot of neat functionality buried in here - you can take two Records and diff them to produce a [Update record], you can apply that with updateRecord :: (Record rec) => rec -> [Update rec] -> rec. Fields can be serialized and deserialized, allowing a type like [Update rec] to be parsed out of a JSON response - now you can have your API clients send just a list of fields to update on the underlying record.
 One of those functions is tabulateEntityA, which allows you to specify an applicative action f for every field, and construct a record from that.
 tabulateEntityA :: (Record rec, Applicative f) => (forall ty. Field rec ty -> f ty) -> f rec 
 Several folks have recognizes that the form Applicative f => (forall ty. Field rec ty -> f ty) is a concept on it's own: the ability to distribute the type constructor f across each field of rec. In other words: the power of Higher Kinded Data without needing to incur the complexity costs for operations that do not require it.
 There is one last concern: the name. We have the concept, we have many functions that operate on the concept, but none of the proposed names have stuck out to me.
 I've got a GitHub issue to discuss the matter here: https://github.com/parsonsmatt/prairie/issues/16
 And I'll back-link the Reddit discussion here to GitHub so we can keep everything correlated.

 Specifically, I want to delete all the contents inside of a tag with smart kill, a la smartparens and parens. I used to use evil mode, and I know you can do it with cit but I'm not really looking to go back.
 Does anybody have recommendations or good workflows they like for working with html a lot?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read a bunch of comments comparing Org Mode to Markdown and editors like Obsidian but there are some points I want to discuss. A big benefit Emacs Org Mode seems to be the built in functionality for things like tasks and times, but that can be done in Obsidian with plugins like Dataview, for every other functionality Org Mode has like that can be done with an Obsidian plugin. I've also read a lot of comments that you can make your own Org Mode functionality using Elisp, Obsidian OTOH uses JS for plugins and code snippets, and I've written a handful of my own snippets. the JS library ecosystem is much larger.
 I get that Emacs has been around for much longer and the Lindy Effect where things that have lasted a long time are likely to last for much longer, however there seems to be far less support for Org outside of Emacs (besides Neorg). OTOH there are many Markdown editors and libraries, so if I decide I want to switch from Obsidian then I could and my Markdown Notes would render fine. I have many notes and don't have much proprietary Markdown in them. What if I became heavily invested in Emacs but in the future felt like using another editor? Or the slim possibility of Emacs development eventually stopping? A lot of Org Mode functionality seems to be specific to Emacs / Emacs' environment (same thing Obsidian JS really). I read one comment saying that implementations outside of Emacs are half baked, like support for Vim motions and features outside of Vim and Neovim.
 I've been spending lots of time setting up Neovim, and right now I'm thinking of using that with Obsidian for Markdown editing with Vim motions. But I want to know if Org Mode / Neorg would be worthwhile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellow 'macsers,
 title says it all, basically. I would like to use TRAMP to edit files remotely, but a session will only last for five minutes, after which a new connection is opened. This leaves a massive papertrail on the machine which I'd like to avoid, instead staying connected for as long as I'd like.
 I already checked my SSH-settings and don't have these kinds of problems when I am connecting via SSH regularly, which leads me to believe that this is related to Emacs/TRAMP. I have tried to set the ssh session timeout to nil via `(add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties '("/ssh:" "session-timeout" nil))` but so far it does not seem to yield the desired result.
 The setup in which I work features a jump host, so that I connect via SSH twice (once to the jump host, than to my actual destination). I have adapted the SSH `ServerAliveInterval` accordingly on both machines, to no avail.
 Do you guys have another tip on how to configure TRAMP so as to make it work as desired? I'd really LOVE to use TRAMP, because it allows me to use Emacs when editing files remotely instead of vim (which is installed on remote machines).
 Have a good day, fellows!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm an outsider: resident vim user. But more relevantly, I'm an online game developer. One thing I've just noticed is that unlike Emacs, the Vim community has a healthy collection of online vim games: VimAdventures, VimGolf, Vim-Racer (my personal favourite with lots of bias) etc.
 The idea just dawned on me that it would be a really low lift to add support for emacs in vim-racer. I'm curious if there would be any interest in an online game for emacs. The game is based around navigating code/text, and your speed determines where you place on the leaderboard.
 Is the lack of online games just a community culture difference i.e. Emacs users just aren't interested in emacs based games, or would you play a game like vim-racer if it had support for emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After reading many posts on r/emacs and r/orgmode I've realized that there are a lot of people who could benefit from using Org Mode but don't know where to start. Either they don't use Emacs at all and thus find the prospect too daunting or they find it too difficult to craft Org Mode into something useful. And this is a real shame because Org Mode is, in my opinion, one of the most useful features of Emacs. So, to help out new users I've created a tutorial geared towards people who are completely new to Org Mode and Emacs. I've included screenshots to show you what to expect as well as a configuration file you can drop in that will give you all the features described in the tutorial. Additionally, there is an org file with explanations of each element, so new users can more easily begin customizing their setup.
 I would encourage any new users to try it out and see if this helps you. For the Org Mode veterans in the crowd, I would appreciate any feedback you might have.

 I even tried setting 2 keybindings, one to turn t and one to turn nil, but nothing, it’s nil, I set it to t, and then it won’t go back via keybinding, even tho if I set it t via init and use the nil keybinding it does, and won’t go back after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I recently started using emacs, and am now trying to find a solution similar to the facebook pathpicker (https://github.com/facebook/PathPicker) plugin for tmux (https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-fpp).
 In effect, this allows you to show all the files (basically paths) in the current tmux buffer and select / open one of them. I was wondering if there is an equivalent in emacs.
 On a related note, I want the same for URLs, similar to https://github.com/dequis/tmux-url-select 
 I was thinking there might already be something in emacs, or perhaps I could achieve this with Hyperbole or some other plugin, but so far could not figure it out. It should not be too hard to script this (I guess you only need to search the buffer for certain regular expressions and then allow the user to select / act on them), but I do not want to reinvent the wheel here. Any ideas?
 Thanks

 I had the idea to solve this problem using unicode math. There are unicode symbols for basically everything math related, and they blend into the main text nicely, even the sub and superscripts. I managed to set up org-mode to latex export to work with unicode math using the answers in https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/20062/exporting-unicode-characters-to-pdf-using-latex-from-org-mode . The only remaining question is how to write unicode math efficiently.
 I have a nice latex setup that mostly relies on abbrevs and yasnippets. It is very straightforward to set up analogous abbrevs/snippets for common unicode math symbols in org-mode, problems only come when I try to implement sub and superscripts. These work in a completely different way in unicode. Instead of having to surround things with {} or _{}, there are separate sub and superscript versions of many symbols. Should I just make sub and superscript versions for each of my snippets + all the regular letters and numbers? There has to be a simpler way. I also came across the package https://github.com/astoff/unicode-math-input.el that seems to do somethings similar to what I want, however it does nothing about the sub/superscript problem.

 If I use cabal build, the project builds just fine, but if I use nix build I get a compiler (i.e. GHC) error:
  src/GTF/Content/Projects.hs:26:22: error: • No instance for (FromJSON URI) arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration Possible fix: use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration, so you can specify the instance context yourself • When deriving the instance for (FromJSON ProjectDetails) | 26 | deriving anyclass (FromJSON) | ^^^^^^^^ 
 I've checked in the logs and the version of network-uri being used matches, so it's not a dependency version problem. I've also checked the GHC version, and it's 9.4.7 which is the same version I'm using with cabal.
 I'm not sure where to look to fix this, does anyone have any pointers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Scala Community,
 I am newbie to Scala language. I have previously worked as Java Developer in the industry and have around 4 years of experience working on Spring Boot framework. However, recently I changed my company and my new company uses Scala as their main language for developing backend applications using Play framework. I have joined as a Software Developer here (not Data Engineer) in hope for learning something new in the field of Software Engineering. I have gone through numerous articles on how Scala skills are considered to be niche skill and has scope mostly in Big Data and Data Engineering roles. I would like to get your valuable insights regarding following concerns :
  
Does learning the FP way of designing applications will help me in longer run in SE industry?
 How much emphasis should be given to learning languages or say new paradigm (I am considering Scala to be more complex than Java, maybe because I'm new to FP) when one's goal is to become a good software engineer?
 Regarding the job market for Scala, I don't see much hope in my region (India) other than DE roles. I am still interested in Software engineering but afraid that investing time in it will be helpful in future or not?
 On the extreme side, should I go back to hone my skills on Java ecosystem (prepare for next switch) or focus in learning Scala language and its ecosystem for maybe next 1-2 years and see if I like it or not? 
  
I tried to keep my doubts as clear as possible. Thanks in advance for your valuable insights.

 But can I really evident SingI instance from my side? Which is unexported from GHC.Generics...
 Otherwise with the symbolVal approach as in the _loadDbaField above, there’s the complain against the ultimate use site:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In org-mode, C-c C-x M-w is bound to the super-useful function org-copy-special, which can for example copy a rectangular area in a table. However, unlike M-w, the highlighted region remains highlighted and is still tracking the cursor.
 One can write a function that runs org-copy-special and deactivates the highlight:
 (defun my/org-copy-special () "Copy the current region using `org-copy-special` and deactivate the mark." (interactive) (org-copy-special) (deactivate-mark)) 
 The function works as intended when used via M-x my/org-copy-special, but I struggle with binding it to C-c C-x M-w using use-package's :bind. For example, the following does not work, and invoking C-c C-x M-w will still run org-copy-special:
 (use-package org :bind (("C-c C-x M-w" . my/org-copy-special))) 
 What is the right way to make C-c C-x M-w in org-mode run my/org-copy-special instead of org-copy-special?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Emacs in daemon mode all the time, usually for about 3-4 weeks without restarting. I've had a few crashes over the years, mostly (I believe) caused by memory issues, as my daily driver has only 8 GiB of RAM and I have loads of Firefox Tabs and PDF files open in zathura (some documents display better there than in pdf-tools).
 I'm not sure if switching to the Lucid toolkit will be more performant, but all the advice I see online seems to encourage its use in daemon mode. However, I'm worried about losing a little functionality like viewing HTML mail in mu4e and similar. I think xwidgets won't work either, but I stopped using it after a recent change caused Emacs to crash.
 Are there any breaking, non-aesthetic, changes I should be aware of before I switch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, following on from the discussion about running effect handlers multiple times across different types I'm exploring some code from polysemy-zoo's Polysemy.Several module and found that it doesn't seem to work for a function with constraints, typically a function with effects.
 Here's a gist with the error
 runSeveral works fine with runReader, but complains about not being able to deduce the effect constraint for my runReaderWithLog which has an extra Members '[Embed IO] r constraint. Any ideas on how to make it compile?
 Some ideas I've considered:
  
Change the type of runSeveral so it applies the same constraints to r and r' - seems like I might have to get into the weeds of Dict and the constraints package, which I'd rather avoid
 
Change the type of runSeveral such that r = r', but then I also get type errors that I suspect are telling me this is the wrong approach - why should r and r' be the same?
 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my Haskell phase I found that I had to think far too much about laziness versus strictness and space leaks, and I ended up writing code full of strictness annotations to get around this. Yet at the same time Haskell provides a certain power and way of thinking that very few other languages do. So what I am wondering is whether there are any languages like Haskell out there that provide both laziness and strictness, but instead of laziness being the default, strictness is instead. Sure, strict-by-default makes it harder to implement things such as infinite lists and foldr, but that seems to be a small loss compared to not having to worry about exhausting one's RAM because one forgot to put a ! somewhere.

It is obvious that in my setup, emacs can distinguish the difference between alt pressed with a key and escape followed by a key press, but how does one unlink esc and alt. That is, bind a different command to alt-somekey than to esc somekey. From the message in the help buffer -- "...

 As I was working in org, I left my emacs session to wander around online for a while. When I returned to emacs, an autocomplete drop-down had appeared, including some of the options in the window above (I then typed __ to see more). These templates look very useful, especially if I can configure them, but I'm not able to figure out what they're called and haven't been able to find the documentation -- or even figure out how to reliably use the templates!
 Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks!

 #+OPTIONS: scheduledornot:t
 Then in the property section of all TODO headers that are not scheduled, a new property is placed indicating "Not scheduled." For example:
  
* TODO Call Ian
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: id-8366ebb9-4059-49ed-a375-7de650e8cab3
 :Scheduled: Not Scheduled

At the same time, if it does have a scheduled date +/- time in it, that property is removed.
  
* TODO Call Ian
 SCHEDULED: <2024-05-06 Mon>
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: id-8366ebb9-4059-49ed-a375-7de650e8cab3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/emacs,
 I submitted a package scala-repl into MELPA. It provides REPL driven development experience for Scala.
 It automatically detects the project root by simply searching for build.sbt or build.sc files in the current folder and its ancestors, till the root folder. When nothing is found, it will simply invoke scala-cli. The command to run when a project is (not) found is configurable.
 I have been using it myself for multiple weeks and am pretty satisfied with it.
 You are more than welcome to try it out and comment out any issues. :-)
 P.S. One thing I have not yet achieved is the ability to hot-reload the application like Common Lisp SLIME/SLY. But it is probably restricted by the limitations of Scala console instead of Emacs...

        <updated>2024-05-05T08:56:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many note-taking apps like Obsidian provide the graph view functionality to visualize the relation of notes. But this kind of graph view only bases on linkages/references(incoming links and outgoing links) between notes. It is hard to recognize a specific long COT(chain of thoughts)——the starting point, the path and the end. Different COTs crossing in the graph view makes it more chaotic.
Luhmann's zettelkasten is a "combination of disorder and order, of clustering and unpredictable combinations emerging from ad hoc selection."
The graph view(generated by linkages/references) in some ways can represent the aspect of disorder of a zettelkasten. But what is the aspect of order?
"The absence of a fixed system of order and, in consequence, a table of contents turned the index into the key tool for using the file – how else should one be able to find certain notes again and thus gain access to the system of references? Not wanting to rely on pure chance requires being able to identify at least one point from which the respective web of references can be accessed. This is the purpose of the keyword index."
Base on my understanding, the aspect of order in Luhmann's zettelkasten is composed of his note IDs and keyword index(register).
As so far, I don't find any note-taking apps provide the graph view functionality basing on Luhmann-style IDs and his keyword index——And this is why I created a new Obsidian plugin "zettelkasten navigation" recently. I think this plugin , in some ways, represents the real Luhmann way to retrive thoughts and navigate notes in a digital zettelkasten. The other note-taking apps should provide the similar functionality as well in future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent a lot of time reading and thinking about if I want to learn Emacs or Vim since they have very high learning curves, I went with Vim because I had been looking a way to better edit text. Vim's modal editing is very powerful, allowing me to make lots of changes to text with only a handful of keystrokes. I wonder if that's why most Vim and Neovim users chose it over Emacs and if that's why Vim is much more popular than Emacs.
 Emacs is a modeless editor and you need a third party emulation like Evil mode for modal editing, but that's not full Vim. You wouldn't be able to install Vim or Neovim plugin, especially ones that extend its modal editing capabilities like the Vim surround plugin. Perhaps it might be possible to use the headless Neovim backend for text editing in Emacs, like the VS Code Neovim extension or Firenvim Firefox addon does, but why do that when you could just use Neovim?
 I think that all the extensibility Emacs has to make it essentially an app platform alone isn't something that appeals to a lot of users, but what if Emacs had modal editing as good as Vi / Vim's from the start? It seems like Vi Vim and even Neovim never had the level of extensibility as Emacs does, so what if it was a matter of picking between a modal editor, and a modal editor with lots of extensibility? (an oversimplified hypothetical comparison but still).
 And by the way, what was the rationale for the decision of Emacs to be a modeless editor rather than a modal editor?

 I started to create my config files for emacs (init.el) and qtile (config.py) with org-babel-tangle.
 The goal is to have a single .org file to tangle multiple output files for multiple systems. The systems have some varying configurations and variables set.
 I started using :noweb successfully so that I can specify codeblocks for pc1, pc2 and common blocks for all.
 But that leads to duplicates.
 What I want to achieve is that I can create a "template" code block where, depending what system the output is created for, other variables are used.

"mod4") ("myTerm" . "alacritty") ("myBrowser" . "firefox") ("myExplorer" . "pcmanfm"))) (cdr (assoc key variables)) #+end_src #+name: variables-pc2 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :var key="" (setq variables '(("mod" . "mod4") ("myTerm" . "alacritty") ("myBrowser" . "chromium") ("myExplorer" . "pcmanfm"))) (cdr (assoc key variables)) #+end_src #+begin_src python test print("<<variable>>."myBrowser">>") #+end_src 
 The block "test" should be tangled with "firefox" for pc1 and "chromium" for pc2.
 Is that possible? 
 Many thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I'm designing a pure FP language similar to... Python :) At least in the spirit of its Zen: "one and preferably only one obvious way to do it", "simple is better than complex", "readability counts" etc, otherwise similar to Haskell (or PureScript even closer now) in semantics. It's just a specification for fun and I don't think it'll ever get to implementation, so below question is purely curiosity-driven you can unleash your imagination if you want.
 So, if you had a chance to embed an effect system in a modern FP language to avoid any boilerplate, syntax quirks and perhaps performance penalties or at least ship it in a stdlib, how would the system look like? Haskell has plenty of options implemented as libraries - I want to avoid this galore given the "one way" mantra. May it could be one of those libraries like polysemy, but as part of language spec? Maybe algebraic effects similar to what Unison has (I'm all for preserving referential transparency), maybe RIO (or thinking of Scala counterpart ZIO) as part of stdlib?

But why not instead encase your user-accessible functions in successive let and cl-flet/labels calls? Is there any memory or efficiency problems with encapsulating your environment with closures in this way?
 I could reason that it limits "hackability", but a lot of "--" functions really are useless outside of their package, and the advice system could be used to inject extra code if a hacker really wanted to, I think.

This release fixes potential bugs.
 The hash that Stack uses to distinguish one build plan from another has changed for plans that set (as opposed to unset) manually Cabal flags for immutable dependencies. This will cause Stack to rebuild dependencies for such plans.

The hashes that Stack uses to distinguish one build plan from another now include the Cabal flags for immutable dependencies set manually. Previously, in error, only such flags that were unset manually were included.

 Hi, I recently tried to transition my entire organization to Emacs, but I'm encountering difficulties. I attempted to install Emacs and Org Mode using Homebrew --cask emacs and emacsformacosx, but encountered an error. So, I followed the tutorial on https://josephdubon.com/blog/how-to-install-doom-emacs-macbook-pro-2023, and it worked, but I don't want Doom, I only want Emacs and Org Mode. How can I achieve this? (I want to emphasize that I specifically need Emacs because I want to follow Reiner's Udemy course.) Please help me :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I met my husband 10 yrs ago, he was everything I ever wanted. We met on a freenode IRC channel. He was a Gentoo and Linux-from-scratch dual-booter who could install both systems with his eyes closed. We used to have long, romantic conversations well past midnight about tabs vs spaces and open source. Our first fight ever was about MIT vs GPL licensing. On our first date, we shared our tiling manager config files with each other (this was the first time I truly felt love for a man).
 However, lately he’s changed into a husk of the man he used to be. He migrated to Linux Mint, because, and I quote, he “just wants to get work done” and he “no longer has time to fiddle with [his] system”. Then, he started using GNOME for the same reason. This was already very suspicious. I mean, if he truly just wanted to start using a full DE, he could have at least picked KDE, right? Even Xfce I’d have been ok with.
 Then, the other day, our relationship hit a breaking point. Here I was, working on my 2012 NixOS thinkpad, and hubby calls me over to his office. He said he “wanted to show me something”. I sit down on his chair, and you can imagine my terror as he pulls up vim on his terminal. He had a weird smile on his face, as if something had taken him over. He spent the next few mins “showing off” a variety of vim tricks he’d just learned. I had to turn my face to the side so he wouldn’t see the tears drying on my cheeks. Let me be clear: This was NOT the man I married.
 Our relationship has had its ups and downs, but I never imagined my husband would stoop so low as to become a vim peasant. I don’t know what to do. Part me says I should just start divorce proceedings and get it over with, but the other part can’t help but wonder if perhaps my husband is being afflicted by some serious, undiagnosed mental illness.
 Please advise reddit, my whole life is in shambles and I don’t know what to do

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks, in Vim, there is a basic feature called "autoindent". Basically, if you start a new line, it'll automatically insert whatever indentation level found in the last line. For example (cursor shown as |):
 def foo(): doSomething()| 
 then you press enter:
 def foo(): doSomething() | 
 the cursor will have the same indent level as the previous line.
 I'm wondering if Emacs has the same functionality.
 EDIT: my workaround:
 (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local indent-line-function #'indent-relative))) (keymap-global-set "<TAB>" 'tab-to-tab-stop) (keymap-global-set "M-i" 'indent-for-tab-command)

 I need some first impressions about the property-style configurations, which look like this:
 :PROPERTIES: :SLIDE_ACTION: ms-action-narrow :with-children t :SLIDE_CHILD_ACTION: nil :END: 
 What kinds of actions and arguments are you expecting to see? I've implemented a few, but renaming is painless until people start writing documents.
 You can of course load the package. If you also install Master of Ceremonies (you will probably enjoy mc-focus) you can complete the entire demo.
 Expect nothing to be stable. I haven't put this on a package archive yet. It's just neat and will be very beneficial to the ecosystem.
 Ask questions. Tell me your expectations.

 After some years of not programming Scala professionally, I am revisiting an old Scala code base that is using Scalajpa. I am not a fan of either JPA or Hibernate, so I would like to replace Scalajpa with something else.
 My previous experience with an ORM-library in the Scala space was Slick, and I was not very pleased with the complexity and syntax.
 Can you recommend a simple Scala ORM? Or should I look into a Java library like jooq?

 its seems to work but the colors are completely off, everything is grey to black.
 Does anyone know if I may have previous theme config that may cause this ? 
 Thank you very much.

 * Foo
 ** Bar
 *** Baz
 The asterisks have to start in the first column.
 It strikes me (especially with org auto indent on) it might be handy to be able to write: (underscore == space, cause reddit)
 * Foo
 ___** Bar
 ______*** Baz
 ie: Make the leading whitespace not relevent
 Now, I'm just being lazy, not wanting to wipe auto-indented spaces while int he typing flow and just entering headlines
 Another option might be a minor mode that detects 'hey we're in org-mode, and that looks like a headline with leading asterisks, lets blow away the whitespace for ya!'; wouldn't be too hard a function to write.
 A function like tht could get goofy, if you're doing say embedded a BEGIN_SRC block with C code in it, with multiline comments, but a function could check if its looking within such a block..
 Anyone considered this sort of thing?

 #+name: my_function #+begin_src python :var data=0 my_function(data) #+end_src #+name: my_data #+begin_src python x=2+2 print(x) #+end_src #+call: my_function(my_data) :results drawer 
 so that in both cases, I would have the my_function(my_output) evaluated and displayed in the buffer.
 I can't quite get this to work -- does anyone see what I'm missing? I'm also using a Python :session my-session argument, which is located in the Org header for the file, so that I don't have to keep adding the :session.

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I'd love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
I'm still interested in connecting via Zoom for a chat if you want.
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK and why I'm here:
I'm wrapping up the final project for this term. Once done, I'm going to hit the #proofing section of my zettelkasten. I'm shifting my focus from reading to writing in the fall term.
Food Reading - I've enjoyed a run of foodie books. They are starting to get under my skin in a good way.
Samu Practice is something I've done for 15 years without much reflection. I'm changing that.
Books I'm reading:
Sertillanges, A. G. and Ryan, Mary. The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods. 1987. PDF [[202402140719]]

 The reason of this is for give to emacs a feel more modern for this decade in comparation to others editors and rivals such as vscode or neovim, about this also for give to that release as the begin of a new and great era for emacs and its community e.g the inclusion of tree-siter, eglot, the work in progress of the new GC, the new json parser, new and great packages, &.c.
 I've done some conceptual icons in case there are interest in this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just wanted to share my emacs-config that I've been using for a while and just recently pushed to GitHub. I've updated the config to use org-mode which then optionally tangles the code (I used to use auto-tangle but have turned that off).
 One of the great things about this config is that most of the packages are deferred. Startup time on my M2 Mac is around 1.5 seconds which I find pretty good.
 Something of note - a lot of inspiration of this came from two sources:
  
System Crafters (Emacs from Scratch)
 A guy name Portesilaos that has some great content.
  
My hope is that someone can find some use out of it.

 (set (intern bar) (cons 3 (symbol-value (intern bar)))) ()(set (intern bar) (cons 3 (symbol-value (intern bar)))) (let ((foo '(1 2)) (bar "foo")) (push 3 (intern bar))) ;; or (let ((foo '(1 2)) (bar "foo")) (set (intern bar) (cons 3 (symbol-value (intern bar))))) 
 The first doesn't work due to the macro and the second is operating in the global namespace and not on the lexically bound local variables.
 Edit version of the question: can I have lexical binding and go from string to corresponding symbol somehow or am I stuck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe you dont like it but that's fine, it is just an idea as of now as someone who is using emacs just for orgmode for years and recently started to use dired. I'm sorry not using it for more than those 2 things, please have mercy with me. 
 So back to my idea. That email "client", well actually it is just a viewer, the receiving and sending part would have to be done with offlineimap, sendmail and friends:
  
there are different orgmode files, e.g. ~/org/mail/inbox.org, ~/org/mail/sent.org, ~/org/mail/drafts.org and all of them contain headlines which actually are emails, but they are just rendered as headlines.
 The headline includes the subject, but could also include some state such as READ or SENT
 The body is the text of the email
 Attachments? Use org attachment to add them
 Maybe we could also use properties for recipients or use the tags, I'm unsure about this one 
 a scheduler would iterate over those files every few minutes/hours and actually sends that email (headline) 
 you can archive an email, which would actually just refile it, or you could also move things around like refiling
 I don't know if you can partially set some parts of the buffer to be read only, I don't know if it would make sense to set all those files to be read only, hmm
 use org capture templates to write a new email, depending on the cursor position it would either be a reply or new mail

 First of all, I have zero treesitter packages installed on my system, nor is it part of my config, grepping my system, I only find treesitter files associated with neovim. Nothing in /usr or ~/.config/emacs

A note about coercions by Oleg Grenrus
Safe coercions in GHC are a very powerful feature. However, they are not perfect; and already many years ago I was also thinking about how we could make them more expressive.

 Would anyone be interested in a paper reading group? Where we commit to reading one paper a week. So there’s some accountability at least. And we could chat about the paper asynchronously.
 Edit: I created a Discord server. If anyone has a better idea, I’m open for that too:

Overview
This is a retrospective of my and many other people’s work on documentation in the Nix ecosystem between October 2022 and March 2024.
It serves as a showcase of what we achieved together, and gives an impression of what’s involved in improving the user experience in a complex software system.
A lot has happened during that time, so this text is quite lengthy.
The details of this report will mainly be interesting to power users and active contributors, or people working on software projects that are in a similar situation as Nix.

 The default window size increases as I add more stuff to the agenda. I work on a laptop with limited display real estate and, at times, the agenda window consumes virtually the entire Org-Mode view, covering virtually all of the tasks I'm working on.
 I manually resize it when I need to. However, it would be better if the agenda consumed no more than 50% of the available Org-Mode real estate.
 I've been trying to find a setting to configure to limit the agenda's vertical height to no more than 50% of the available window space. That is, the top half of the Org window would contain my tasks, and the bottom half would contain my agenda.
 Is this possible?

 It seems functions like xref-find-definitions only works for the function in the headers or the same file fiel I am editting. So too with the other lsp-mode functions I am tried.
 Is there some setting I have to set to make it search the whole project? Or some extra p[ackage to install?
 If not can someone suggest what the latest present day tags/package is. I am using etags and that seems kind of creaky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I just got back into dev mode for a few days for the job and I just noticed that narrowing with consult-imenu does not seem to work on my setup (see below). Tested with a Python code base and a C code base. In other consult cases, the narrowing feature works perfectly (consult-buffer, consult-org, consult-flymake). I don't know since when it does not work for consult-imenu because I discovered the narrowing feature in consult only a few months ago, and only got the opportunity to try the feature on a code base/consult-imenu since yesterday. Anyone else is having this behavior ?
 I can open an issue on Github if needed. I didn't do it yet because the code for consult-imenu has not changed for 4 months, and since I could not find any complaint about this, I suspect it might be related to my personal setup. So I wanted to probe the community first before bothering minad.
 My setup
  
Emacs 29.3, compiled by myself
 consult version 20240420.929, from Melpa
  
The steps to reproduce the issue
  
open a Python or C file in Emacs, with a lot of functions and variable
 hit M-x consult-imenu
 a nice, searchable, consult prompt shows up with all the functions/modules/variable tagged appropriately
 hit the narrow key (< in my case)
  
Expected result
 There should be either a which-key frame showing the next key to type, or, if I'm quick enough, either I should be able to type f, and according to the consult-imenu code, it should filter on the functions only.
 Actual result
 < or <f are taken literally, like a conventional search pattern.

((backup-inhibited . t)) ))  but when I open emacs it asks me if I want to apply that setting as it is not considered a safe local variable. Is there a safe way to achieve this. I guess I could make backup-inhibited a safe local variable, but I'm concerned whether this will lead to security issues. What's the safest way to disable backups within a directory?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the comment -> "Haskell was unironically the easiest programming language for me to learn, and remains the easiest programming language for me to read and write. I'll explain why. Every other programming language forces the programmer to keep track of time in order to read and write the code. There is a notion of when things happen that needs to be considered, and this often makes it hard to re-use code and leads to unexpected interactions. Haskell code, on the other hand, requires no notion of time. Haskell code is tenseless, inert. Haskell code doesn't do things. Haskell code merely means things. That made it easier to learn, read, and write than other languages like Java or even Python and Javascript."
 This is the link to the comment -> https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/s/uhjWTq0rRb
 I was curious if there's any resource that helps you learn haskell the same way the commentor learned. Or if there's some blog posts which teaches you how to look at Haskell language similar to the commentators perspective

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I'm a new-ish Emacs user (~1 year) and I've just started using the emacs-jupyter package for writing Python code. I used to write (too many) jupyter notebooks with VSCode but I find that I can organize my code & notes better with org documents and just simple Python files. I started using emacs-jupyter after reading Martí Bosch's blog on the topic. My current workflow is just opening up a python file (or write a new one), then running `jupyter-run-repl` and then `jupyter-repl-associate-buffer`. Then I do execute a region or execute line-by-line via `jupyter-eval-line-or-region` bound to `C-c C-c`. The thing with this workflow is that the jupyter REPL gets quite long as I'm tweaking little things about the graphs or visualization I'm working on. Is there a better workflow that people use for doing this kind of work? I also can't find a way to clear the jupyter REPL that I'm working on.

I did try to investigate the cause of these dropouts, and I changed some connection pool settings I thought were a bit funky, but then I realised no matter what I can do, database connections CAN drop out. Temporary network outages, whatever, the real world isn't perfect.
 So instead of just letting this exception just bubble up, I should be catching and retrying. 
 So then I got reading about runtime exceptions in Haskell. And I found there are broadly two categories:
  
Asynchronous

Asynchronous come from other threads, and you don't want to catch and retry those. These are like another thread asking you to fin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I have this code (it is an adaptation of gnus-delay.el for working with notmuch) that sets up some timer (like "every 5 minutes") that then chains an idle timer. The attempted result is "every 5 minutes, then when idle for 30 seconds; rinse and repeat".
 (defvar notmuch-delay-timer-scheduled nil "The current timer for the scheduled run.") (defvar notmuch-delay-timer-idle nil "The current timer for the idle run.") (defun notmuch-delay-scheduled-runner () (unless (memq notmuch-delay-timer-idle timer-idle-list) (setq notmuch-delay-timer-idle (run-with-idle-timer 30 nil #'notmuch-delay-send-queue)))) ;;;###autoload (defun notmuch-delay-initialize () (unless (memq notmuch-delay-timer-scheduled timer-list) (setq notmuch-delay-timer-scheduled (run-at-time t 300 #'notmuch-delay-scheduled-runner)))) 
 The code works. But I can't remove the feeling that there must be a much nicer way to do this properly or more Lispy.
 I would imagine I could use one single var with `car` and `cdr` thus having both timers there; but that's still two timers and two functions.
 Any ideas?
 Chaining the idle timer after the scheduled one is to make sure that I am not working in Emacs when notmuch-delay-send-queue is called.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to participate more in Emacs-related mailing lists, occasionally without subscribing to them. I have recently sent an email to help-gnu-emacs, which I am not subscribed to, and received replies judging by the mailing list archive but those replies never landed in my inbox. Is the mailing list etiquette not to reply to the person specifically but only to the mailing list? This makes little sense to me since non-subscribing users would miss emails in this case, but I have also checked that I am able to receive emails at the address that I used. Now I would like to reply back, and I am thinking of replying using the mailing list archive. Is there something I should do to ensure that I receive the replies in my inbox? (I am still not subscribed to help-gnu-emacs.)

 Here's an app I wrote for myself and have been using for some time .. and with some encouragement decided to clean up and release for anyone else who might find it useful. 
 It's a windows task switcher with first class support for search, and much more responsive and feature-rich than the windows default.
 Its built with Rust and Tauri for backend, and uses direct ScalaJS for frontend w no other framework.
 Repo is https://github.com/yakrider/switche/
 The Readme there has all the necessary info to 'git gud' with it, incl configuring hotkeys and features. 
 Screenshot of this first-ever-released version 2.2.7 is below. 
 Try it out and hopefully it might be useful for some of ya'll. 
 I'm happy to field bug reports, questions, concerns, feedback of any kind.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do now know Haskell (I somehow managed to avoid it at university, and my favorite language is C).
 But I want to use sv2v (A System Verilog to Verilog translator), which is written in Haskell. The Makefile uses Haskell Stack. I've tried on three Debian GNU/Linux testing systems:
  
amd64 - works fine.
 arm64 - ran into issues not obvious to a non-Haskell user https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v/issues/282
 ppc64 - ran into issues not obvious to a non-Haskell user https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v/issues/283
  
I don't tend to see such problem with programs written in C - for a simple program, I just use the C compiler on whatever system I want to compile the C program on and that's it; for more complex programs people tend to ship a configure script that works (or tells me what to install if a dependency is missing).
 Now I wonder if the issues I saw are sv2v-specific, or a wider protability problem with programs written in Haskell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The whole concept of "emacs as an operating system", i.e. building applications like org-mode inside the editor, and using regular editor text buffers as the software interface is super interesting to me.
 I think this might be the direction I want to go in for a lot of custom personal software that I build for myself.
 So I'd like to learn a little more about the subject, but I'm struggling to find the right terminology to search the web for.
 I'm not an emacs user currently, I only ever tinkered with it for a few hours to try out org-mode many many years ago. So this probably doesn't help.
  
Some questions:
  
1) Are there any commonly used concise terms around this whole "editor as an application interface" concept in general? 
 ...it could be either specific to emacs, or more broadly for other editors too.
 
e.g. We have some pretty common terms like "CLI, TUI, GUI, desktop-app, web-based, mobile-app" etc that are used to quite clearly denote the all the common interfaces...
 So I'm hoping there's some easily-Google-searchable short term for this stuff too?
 
 2) If you know of any specific guides/learning resources on the topic, please share a link (or name I can search).
 3) I'm guessing that emacs is the #1 GOAT when it comes to how well it can do this stuff? But curious what other editors can also do this, and how they compare in abilities?
 4) Amongst the variants of emacs, which is best for this? For my use case it needs to work just as well on Windows as Linux.
 5) Also feel free to share any personal anecdotes on what discovering this paradigm meant to you personally. 
 Including where you've seen big improvements in usability/efficiency etc
 And maybe also were there any specific use cases where you over-estimated how useful it would be? And you went back to the mainstream types of interface for something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm working on learning Haskell for personal enrichment. I already know OCaml rather well and use it for personal projects, so Haskell comes fairly easily. (except those compiler messages are brutal for newbs)
 However, there is kind of an uncanny valley for me between the Haskell one learns in tutorials and the Haskell (and GHC tricks) one is actually supposed to use to write software. Some examples:
  
Don't actually use String, use ByteString
 In fact don't use lists at all when performance counts.
 Except obviously for iteration, when fusion is applicable. 
 which, I don't know when that is.
 
 sprinkle around strictness annotations and seq liberally. 
 also not really sure when to do that.
 
 Of course if you are doing X, you will definitely use pragma Y.
  
I'm also interested to find out about the 3rd-party libraries "everyone" uses. e.g. in Python, requests is more or less the "standard" http client, rather than the one in the standard library. In OCaml, you use the Re package for regex, never the Str module in the standard library because it's not thread safe and is super stateful.
 I wish to know these kinds of things that "real" Haskell programmers know. Got any relevant links?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who don't know what I'm talking about, I don't blame you. It's basically only referenced in this talk by Odersky from ScalaDays and random discussion threads scattered that only reference that talk. It mentions a new research project on algebraic effects called Caprese (Capabilities for Resources and Effects). 
 I was confused about the discourse around this project because some people have stated that it's already making its way into scala 3, but I haven't seen any kind of technical details, documentation, talks, or anything else I would expect from what appears to some to be a big change for the language. 
 Honestly I'm mostly just excited and want to know more. Especially since a lot of people I respect seem to see this as a possible avenue for resolving some of the bigger issues with scala like fragmentation/effort duplication and the poor ergonomics and high skill barrier of IO and tagless final. 
 Anyone have any good articles or resources that actually dive into the topic more and explore how it could affect library design in the future?

 Packages like olivetti-mode, golden-ratio and the lakes tries to style buffers to make them more pleasantly readable. I have even tried out vertico-posframe, which is a good idea, but haven't worked much in it yet, and I have feeling it will break some workflows, or maybe be obstructive.
 Have you tried "center" the minibuffer output, so your eyes don't have to travel to the bottom corner every time you invoke an interactive command?
 I know this is very much about ergonomics and work positions too ... but still wondered enough to ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a very weird vim workflow and would love to port it to emacs, org in particular. I had my emacs phase but am a strong vim user for plenty of years.
 For less distraction, I use a Windows 7 laptop at home, while I use a modern Linux one for work. I manage all my TODOs and Notes via vim on a server that I can access from both via ssh/mosh.
 I have plenty of vim tabs per instance, and several instances. All in a named tmux session that I can attach/unattach everytime I want to read it, so that I never have to actually reopen them. I thus have "built a GUI" by permanently using the same tmux splits.
 How would I do this in emacs (tui)? - I know that remote editing would usually be done via TRAMP, but I really want to keep the window open on the server. - Emacs within tmux is clunky because of overlapping bindings and nested terminal emulation. - I am confused on the differences of emacs server vs emacs daemon?

There seem to be three "Date" options. "%D" as the date from the header, "%d" as an Article Date with only Month and day, and "%o" as the article Date in a long unseparated format. Is there any option to get a custom date format in there? %D is super verbose, including also timezone and such. "%o" is hard to parse as a non-separated string. "%d" is not enough granularity
 Can individual parts of the summary line be bolded or italizised? I'm looking to have the From Adress in Bold to better find it. If that's not possible, i guess i have to work with fixed width "blocks" to make it somewhat into a table.
  
Any other great tips for a gnus "newcomer" that you found to be valuable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After getting some useful tips about using clock tables for my time reporting needs I've setup everything and basically it works pretty fine. My only problem is that the table shows the full hierarchy to a task.
 so if I have something like this:
 * Administration ** Meetings *** Weekly meetings :LOGBOOK: * Specification ** WIP *** Tasks **** Task 1 :LOGBOOK: **** Task 2 :LOGBOOK: 
 When I now create a clock table It would look like this (this is the compact view):
 | Headline | Time | |-------------------------------+--------| | *Total time* | *3:20* | |-------------------------------+--------| | Administration | 0:32 | | \_ Meetings | 0:32 | | \_ Weekly Meetings | 0:32 | | Specification | 2:48 | | \_ WIP | 2:48 | | \_ Tasks | 2:48 | | \_ Task 1 | 1:35 | | \_ Task 2 | 1:13 | 
 What I would prefer is something like this
 | Headline | Time | |-------------------------------+--------| | *Total time* | *3:20* | |-------------------------------+--------| | Weekly Meetings | 0:32 | | Task 1 | 1:35 | | Task 2 | 1:13 |

 I dropped the file in `~/.emacs.d` but when I invoke `(load-theme 'nano t)` from `init.el`, I get an error ("Unable to find theme file for 'nano' ...").
 Any help is immensely appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am going through the Emacs Lisp Intro manual to consolidate my Elisp knowledge. In the "More Complex" section, the function "copy-to-buffer" is suggested as a case study. I will include it here for your reference:
 (defun copy-to-buffer (buffer start end) "Copy to specified BUFFER the text of the region." (interactive "BCopy to buffer: \nr") (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer))) (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer) (barf-if-buffer-read-only) (erase-buffer) (save-excursion (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end))))) 
 Perhaps I do not understand well how the save-excursion works. But, since we are setting temporarily the current buffer to the "buffer" argument by using the "with-current-buffer", and we are erasing its contents with "erase-buffer", why do we use "save-excursion"?
 After we use "erase-buffer" don't we get point, point-min and point-max set to 1?
 It seems to me that it is just redundant to save the excursion inside the empty buffer when all the points have the value 1. Then why do we do that?
 Thank you very much.
 EDIT: I think that I understand the reason of save-excursion in this case. It is a user-friendly feature. It ensures that after pasting the text in the empty buffer, the point is set back to the value 1. I guess it is a just to avoid confusing the user by having the point set to point-max. When the user switches to the buffer where the selection was pasted, the users will see the beginning of the buffer instead of the end. Please feel free to correct me if you have a better explanation.

I did the tests with no commands running.
 can I change that behaviour in vterm ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Previously I had Java working with lsp-mode. Experimenting with tree-sitter recently has caused this to break.
 I'm using Emacs 29.2 on a Mac.
 My lsp-mode config is very basic:
 (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-lens-mode) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration) :config (setq lsp-prefer-flymake nil lsp-client-packages '(lsp-clients lsp-metals))) 
 And lsp-java:
 (use-package lsp-java :ensure t :init :config (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'lsp) (add-hook 'java-ts-mode-hook 'lsp) (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(java-ts-mode . "java"))) 
 However, when I open a Java file I get:
  
LSP :: There are no language servers supporting current mode java-ts-mode' registered withlsp-mode'.
  
Clearly the major mode is different with tree-sitter, it's now 'java-ts-mode'. Looking in lsp-java.el though, I do see this in the 'lsp-register-client' function:
  :major-modes '(java-mode java-ts-mode jdee-mode) 
 There is obviously something else I'm missing. Any help is appreciated.

 However, when I'm in a python file, this bind doesn't run correctly: python-shell-get-process-or-error: Start a Python process first with M-x run-python or ‘C-c C-p’
 But if I run the default emacs compile: M-x compile It works correctly, why? Is there a way to make this function of mine behave the same way as the native emacs compile? I like how it turned out because it doesn't open a large buffer and it makes it much easier when I want to run a file.

 But somehow it's not working. The original behavior remains....
 What is the trick then?

 I see it takes three arguments, the first is a function, the second the accumulator, and the third a list. Then the result is of type b. Could someone decipher, first, why the function uses two type variables a and b? If the function is binary commutative addition (+), why can't the description just be (a -> a -> a)? And the accumulator is type b, again, why not just type a? And what is being indicated by t a? The Foldable t means t must be a type for which Foldable has an instance. Again, why this t a notation?

 I also noticed that the text in the icons is a little above and not centered. I was wondering if anyone had been able to figure out how to correct this in vanilla emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was presented with Haskell in this semester (I'm in the second semester of college). It was functional paradigma time to learn. All my friends hate it. At first, I didn't like it too. I found it weird, since the first language that I had contact with was C and it is much different from Haskell. Besides, my teacher wasn't a good professor, so this made things worse. But instead of saying that this language is useless, I decided to give it a chance, since there might be a reason I'm supposed to learn it. After that, I end up enjoying Haskell and started viewing it as a new tool and a different approach to solve problems. I told my friends that I would continue to learn Haskell and read books about it during vacation time, and they laughed at me, told me that it is useless, that I'm just wasting my time, that Haskell has no real life application and that I should learn Java if I wanna get a job (we'll learn Java next semester). I felt discouraged because I DO wanna get a job. My mom works very hard so I can only study, and I want as soon as I can be able to financially help her (or at least help her a bit). What I am asking is if learning Haskell will help me in the future somehow or am I just being naive?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can download binaries for this pre-release from: Release rc/v2.15.6.1 · commercialhaskell/stack · GitHub.
 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version soon, as the changes are made to allow a released version of Stack to build with the coming GHC 9.10.
 Release notes:
  
This release fixes potential bugs.
  
Changes since v2.15.5:
 Major changes: 
  
Stack 2.15.5 and earlier cannot build with Cabal (the library) version 3.12.0.0. Stack can now build with that Cabal version.
  
Behaviour changes: 
  
Stack’s StackSetupShim executable, when called with repl and stack-initial-build-steps, no longer uses Cabal’s replHook to apply initialBuildSteps but takes a more direct approach.
  
Bug fixes:
  
Fix a regression introduced in Stack 2.15.1 that caused a ‘no operation’ stack build to be slower than previously.

 The two images are before on the left vs afterwards on the right.
 Note the constructors, methods, inner classes are placed as items under the class. I also discovered the builtin rules misclassified enums nodetype and fixed that as well. Finally, although I normally adjust the faces to all black/gray I've left it at the default to highlight something odd about the treesitter node creation code. Based on some unknown code path about half the time the node names come with the original properties including faces and the rest of the time they are plain text.
 Some sample in progress code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my daily work I often work for clients that need me to track and report my time based on what exactly I did in a project. Like Meetings, coding feature x, writing documentation, ... On the other hand my employer has a project which is just assigned to the project I do for the customer. So it is basically a hierarchy with two levels:
 * TODO employer project ** TODO customer Meetings ** TODO customer Coding ** TODO customer Documenting 
 So at the end of the day I need to tell the customer the more granular times and the employer the overall times.
 What I want to have is a feature where I clock in on the customer todos but can also see a daily aggregation on the employer todo. How could I do that in org mode?
 It would be also awesome if I could have the customer todos in a different file and just "backlink" them to the employer todo which is in its own separate file

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm hoping you might be able to help me out with this. My sister was diagnosed with a progressive auto-immune disease not to long ago. To simplify things, she has started to develop arthritis-like symptoms that will get progressively worse, and she will lose her vision over time. 
 She's not very technical, but I know there are a lot of interesting ergonomics modes like xah-fly-keys, or even just spacemacs style bindings with a leader key. I'd love some recommendations for relatively easy to learn ergonomics systems that might be less intimidating to newer users. Right now I'm leaning towards spacemacs because that seems the easiest way for someone who would probably be pretty put off by editing an init.el right out of the gate. 
 I also thought that over time she could augment this with speech to text as well as text to speech. I know that there are a number of emacs tools like emacsspeak, but I remember seeing a video on youtube where someone had some hooks into a google text to speech library, and was using ai to send audio clips to chat gpt.If that rings a bell for anyone, please let me know what they were using. I haven't been able to find it, but I'd love any other recommendations or thoughts there as well. 
 Anyway, thanks in advance!

Ignoring "high level" declarative functions such as seq-filter, what's the best way to build a list step by step? AFAIK, each call to append takes O(n) where n is the numbers of elements in the list. Also keeping a reference of the last cons of the list in order to nconc it might be frowned upon, as it is a destructive operation.

 Last question, 
 if you were to become a scala developer now, would you invest much time into quirks and features of scala, or would you spend more time to become a badass data engineer with more tools (pyspark, cloud, kubernetes, kafka [architecture wise])

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm trying eglot and I've just enabled it manually while I'm still trying and figuring things out with `M-x eglot` in my Main.java file. Things seem to work and it is really doing a good job so far! My only issue is, if I try to "go to definition" of one of the builtin classes or the ones that are provided from maven, it doesn't go there as expected. For instance, `import picocli.CommandLine.Command` if the cursor is on Command and I try to go to definition, it just doesn't go there and the minibuffer highlights the Command part for a second. The same thing for the java builtin methods. such as System.out.println. Is there a way to make them work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! 
 I've had this bug for some time now, this is what I've got:
 symptom: in the shell, when asked for password, prompt shows in minibuffer, then quits a second or two later (while I'm typing said password) leading to only the later half of my password being typed in clear text. 
 comint-watch-for-password-prompt runs comint-send-invisible in a (run-at-time 0 nil ...). If I replace run-at-time by the lambda content it is supposed to run, no more bug. If I replace 0 by 1 or 0.1, no more bug either. For values under 0.01 bug is back.
 If I add "lol" at the end of comint-watch-for-password-prompt, so that run-at-time's cancelable timer is not returned to the caller, the bug still happens, so... it's not quitting because somebody is canceling the timer. 
 So, what do I with this? 
 for reference, here is the function I'm talking about:
 (defun comint-watch-for-password-prompt (string) "Prompt in the minibuffer for password and send without echoing. Looks for a match to `comint-password-prompt-regexp' in order to detect the need to (prompt and) send a password. Ignores any carriage returns (\\r) in STRING. This function could be in the list `comint-output-filter-functions'." (when (let ((case-fold-search t)) (string-match comint-password-prompt-regexp (string-replace "\r" "" string))) ;; Use `run-at-time' in order not to pause execution of the ;; process filter with a minibuffer (run-at-time 0.1 nil (lambda (current-buf) (with-current-buffer current-buf (let ((comint--prompt-recursion-depth (1+ comint--prompt-recursion-depth))) (if (> comint--prompt-recursion-depth 10) (message "Password prompt recursion too deep") (when (get-buffer-process (current-buffer)) (comint-send-invisible (string-trim string "[ \n\r\t\v\f\b\a]+" "\n+"))))))) (current-buffer))))

Today I was reading about the Knowledge Cycle and taking notes and I thought to myself this forum and site is a real gold mine of people that are looking to improve the world, grow and share their knowledge.
I am a Engineering Manager, comming from a development background. And I am just addicted to learning, if anybody did a Gallup test I have Learner, Intellection and Input as the first three skills. I like to learn stuff, I like to think about stuff and I like to gorge on information, so as you may presume I am a big fan of the Collector Fallacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I have a record type like
 data PosInt = PosInt { getInt :: Int } 
 and I want to maintain some invariance about it. Here, that the wrapped Int is always positive (I know in this example I could also use a newtype but bear with me). So (I guess?) the standard approach would be to not expose the type constructor, so only the current module can construct instances of type PosInt. However, I still want to give read access to the wrapped Int, so I want to expose getInt. I might end up with something like:
 module Lib ( PosInt(getInt), setInt) where data PosInt = PosInt { getInt :: Int } setInt :: Int -> Maybe PosInt setInt x | x > 0 = Just (PosInt x) | otherwise = Nothing 
 Now if I try to construct a PosInt outside this module, the type checker complains:
 import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test1 :: PosInt test1 = PosInt (-3) -- type error 
 So far so good. But given a PosInt I can actually violate my invariance using the getInt field:
 import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test2 :: PosInt -> PosInt test2 x = x { getInt = -3 } -- no type error 
 That caught me a bit off guard. It's not a problem if I define getInt "manually":
 data PosInt = PosInt Int getInt :: PosInt -> Int getInt (PosInt x) = x 
 Maybe I misunderstood the role of record fields. This convention of calling them getSomething gave me the impression that they only give read access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tldr: Don't upgrade your tree-sitter library, otherwise Emacs will crash when loading it. If you've already upgraded tree-sitter, either a) roll back to v0.22.2, or b) rebuild Emacs. If you use a package manager, uninstalling and reinstalling Emacs should rebuild Emacs.
 The latest version of tree-sitter library is binary-incompatible with the previous version, but the ABI version remains unchanged. That means package managers will simply replace the old libtree-sitter.so file with the new one. Then when Emacs runs, this binary-incompatible libtree-sitter.so is loaded and crashes Emacs.
 What should've happened is for tree-sitter to bump the ABI version; then package managers would install the new libtree-sitter.so file alongside the old libtree-sitter.so, rather than replacing it. And Emacs will still load the old libtree-sitter.so. 
 Rebuilding Emacs will resolve this issue since Emacs and tree-sitter remain compatible on the source level. Rebuild the Emacs binary and it'll be compatible with the new tree-sitter binary.

 I checked the widget library in emacs and I would like to know what is the concern about use this library ?
 Nobody who write a new mode/package use the widgets.
 I think to use this library for the setting it is reasonable but every package creator prefer the "code" based setting.
 I know I can use the customize-variable to set a variable but to create a custom page with widget to setup a module/mode/function should be a good point for the newbies.
 Is there a plan to use GTK based widget in the future ? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently trying to rely more on emacs for file browsing and stumbled upon the openwith package. It allows the user to specify which programs to use for opening which file types, and the choice is respected by find-file and dired-find-file. This is super useful as there are some file types which I never want to open in emacs. 
 The following config is more or less taken from github and tells emacs to open "doc", "xls", ... with "libreoffice":
 (use-package openwith :config (setq openwith-associations (list (list (openwith-make-extension-regexp '("doc" "xls" "ppt" "odt" "ods" "odg" "odp")) "libreoffice" '(file)) )) :init (openwith-mode 1)) 
 Unfortunately, it requires me to explicitly specify which program to use for which file and does not seem to work when I replace "libreoffice" with "xdg-open". Does anybody know why or whether there are any alternative packages that do something similar but work with xdg-open?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep my org-directory separate from the location of my Org-roam notes files. I'd like to quickly search my Org-roam files for nodes with various TODO states. 
 How can I do this in an efficient way via org-ql (I can use rgrep to achieve something similar)? 
 Using org-ql-search interactively allows me to choose "all" files/directories, which is too broad. There doesn't seem to be universal argument support, so I can't pass the directory via "C-u".
 I've also tried the org-roam-ql package, but for whatever reason, this doesn't seem able to return the correct results -- maybe all the nodes have to be proper Org-roam nodes, with a corresponding org-id?
