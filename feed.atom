Most of the time, I share an Apple note with my girlfriend so we can both keep track of goals or tasks we have in common. I would use another tool, but she is not into this basic geekery of markdown or linking notes; although at one point, we were deep into Workflowy and shared several nodes."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Emacs (evil-mode) for extensive note-taking but don't have much programming experience. Can someone help me with a function to copy visually selected text in org-mode to clipboard and exclude the org emphasis markers, e.g. selecting raw text +string+ copies to clipboard just string? org-copy-visible by itself doesn't copy to system clipboard. Also, I don't want to think about whether to use org-copy-visible or evil-yank--99% of the time I just want to evil-yank and also don't want the emphasis markers copied to clipboard (e.g. copy paste to document or terminal).
 Basically:
  
Should rely on org-copy-visible which probably does a better job than trying to parse selected text using regex
 
Custom function or overloading evil-yank only for org-mode where org-copy-visible is relevant. I prefer to just use plain evil-yank in non-org-mode buffers instead of e.g. my\evil-yank that falls back to evil-yank since this is less efficient in scenarios where I'm working with non-org-mode buffers.
 
 Much appreciated.

 Suppose I have already an emacsclient instance with another buffer opened, for example "sample.org". How can I ensure that if I run a function, such as emacsclient -e "(flyspell-buffer)", the function is executed with the buffer being set correctly to "sample.org"?
 I am asking because I have noticed that emascsclient -e "(buffer-name)" returns *server* buffer all the time and it has weird behavior with functions that expect the buffer set correctly.
 Is there a way to do this from Emacs, without relying on the window manager?
 EDIT: There is no easy solution for this. I will just stick to Alt-x.

 To a text like this:
 foo1

 Bar: foo8
 That is: I need to get rid of the vertical bars, trailing whitespaces and of some fixed lines (lines 2, 7, 9 and 10), and then I need to prepend certain lines (3-6) with "+ " and another line (line 8) with "Bar: ".
 I tried with macros but it gets too complex, so I guess I need to write a function to do just that. I'm not elisp fluent at all and I'm hoping the elisp wizards can give me a hand.

 I know there is a new feature in Emacs (I think since 29) that you could enable to make Emacs act more like other modern Desktop programs, where you could scroll with the mouse wheel and the view would change, but the position of the point remains where it is. When the point is then moved to (via arrow key for example) the view would jump back to the point. 
 I know I read this somewhere, but I just can not find it. Someone know what I mean?

 Big release from HuggingFace this week. They released a large, language model for code (https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder). It has 15.5B parameters, 8192 context window, it was trained on permissively licensed code. Looks like it's the best open alternative for copilot.
 There is also a VSCode extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HuggingFace.huggingface-vscode 
 Nothing for Emacs, but I think adding it would not be that hard (the above extension itself is a fork of a TabNine extension). 
 Semi-related interesting post https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/posts/copilot-internals.html#reverse-engineering-preview on reverse engineering the copilot extension (how it prompts the LLM to add context about your project). Might be useful to add to the Emacs extension.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm finding myself defining "ToJSON"/"FromJSON" instances sometimes, as I don't want to rely on the Generics based "deriving anyclass" serialiser to do this for me as it means:
  
I need to hack my datatype to fit the names and format I want for the JSON serialisation, not what makes most sense from an internal logic in workability sense.
 My design is then brittle to refactorings, even simple variable name chages.
  
I'm also using Servant+Swagger, and would like to keep the Swagger docs up to date, although defining the "ToSchema" swagger classes is even more complex.
 What just occurred to me is basically what I'm doing in each case is specifying how my data type maps to a Key/Value map, where Values can either be numbers, strings, arrays or key value maps themselves. Most serialisation formats are something like that.
 Think of it as a "serialisation/deserialisation" description AST.
 Indeed I would think if I had such a structure, I would think I'd be able to define "ToJSON", "FromJSON" and "ToSwagger" instances from it, and perhaps others in the future. If I get them right once, then I can provide APIs/docs in different formats and know they'll be in sync for all serialisation/deserialisation formats.
 Has this idea been attempted in a library? I don't want to reinvent the wheel? Or is there no wheel and do people think it's a wheel worth inventing (and why/why not?)

 type SomeYear = Refined (Or (Or (EqualTo 1923) (EqualTo 1924)) (Or (EqualTo 1926) (EqualTo 1930))) Int 
 However, as you can see, this approach can get tedious and verbose when working with a larger set of allowed years. I was hoping to define a helper type that would allow me to specify a type-level list of allowed years, like so:
 type SomeYear = OneOf '[1923, 1933, 1926, 1930, ...] 
 But I'm stuck on how to implement the OneOf type. Can anyone offer guidance on how to do this?

 https://www.youtube.com/live/d18Fdu6ayM8?feature=share
 In this episode, we will discuss the QuantifiedConstraints language extension.
 For this episode we will assume familiarity with type classes. An understanding of type families will be helpful for a part of the episode, but is not a requirement.
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks. The playlist containing the first episode is here:
 https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:
 https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder
 And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a command that invokes
 (call-process "gnome-terminal" nil 0) 
 and the recent update to Gnome 44 broke it. But not always:
  
If I launch emacs from a terminal (Gnome Terminal) and use my command or evaluate the form above, it works all right.
 If I do nohup emacs > /dev/null 2>&1 & so I can close the terminal from which I started Emacs, the command works until I close that terminal. After I close it, the command or the form do nothing.
 The normal way to use it for me is from an Emacs session started by a desktop file (I believe, because all this stuff is GUIed away. And also the real normal way for me would be to open a frame connected to a server session, but that's now utterly broken and matter for another post). When evaluated in such an instance, the terminal that opens is not very collaborative and says
  
 bash: Error in ~/.profile.mine: directory ~/src/scripts/by_others not found.: No such file or directory bash: /usr/share/Modules/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux:[more paths…]: No such file or directory bash: readlink: command not found... Packages providing this file are: 'coreutils' 'coreutils-single' bash: basename: command not found... Packages providing this file are: 'coreutils' 'coreutils-single' Install package 'ncurses' to provide command 'tput'? [N/y] 
 Using my ignorance I guessed that the terminal that Emacs launches is somehow tied to the terminal that launched Emacs and that I don't know how to fix it.
 I know that I should report this to Gnome developers but you know that would be a waste of time.
 I'm on Emacs 30.0.50 (pure GTK build, in case it matters) and it was the same in v. 28.2.

 [Gentoo Linux Host] –ssh–> [WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Windows VM)] –open–> [emacs] –edit–> /mnt/c/<Path>/<Files>
 There is a significant performance increase to using the windows git.exe instead of the one on Ubuntu in wsl as I am working primarily in /mnt/c/<Path>/<Files>
 I setup magit-git-executable to use windows git.exe as follows:
 elisp (when (string-match "-[Mm]icrosoft" operating-system-release) (setq magit-git-executable "/mnt/c/Program Files/Git/cmd/git.exe")) 
 It works great; however, the only thing I cannot seem to get working is magit-commit
 I did manage to get it working without emacs however.
 I created a script in wsl to convert the git.exe path argument to a wsl path

The benefits of your Zettelkasten highly depend on the longevity of each note. Since the Zettelkasten as life-long companion and comrade in the battle for and against knowledge is a long-term endeavor, it is crucial that you create notes and structures that will last a long time. The minimum goal should be that they last a lifetime, so they are optimally designed for yourself. Ideally, they last forever, so future generations can benefit from your work as well.

 I could capture everything into a single inbox, then sort everything at the end of the day. It could be feasible.
 What I'd like to know is what's a good way to categorize stuff:
  
1 category = 1 file (everything about cooking is in cooking.org)
 
1 category = 1 directory (everything about cooking is in the same directory. 1 bookmark = 1 file)
 
1 category = 1 tag (bookmarks are in different files - for example journals - and i can retrieve them with org-ql)
 
 I know it's subjective, but I'd like to know your experiences in this regard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do see a lot of potential in the below tool that uses AI to generate a draft task list with the correct subtasks broken down. I think it would honestly be a great quality of life to be able to export an org markdown file directly from a tool like this, insert it into org mode and already have a lot of the boilerplate work done in structuring relatively common tasks/projects (I don't imagine this tool would work well for more obscure tasks).
 https://goblin.tools/
 I sent some feedback to the dev of this to ask for org markdown export functionality but if they don't do it someone else will eventually, the application of "AI" is just too sensible. When my ADHD is bad, just breaking down tasks into subtasks is exhausting, if an AI can do the stupid simple work (that isn't demanding, complex mental work) of just getting most of my tasks written down than it is so much easier to start.

I would like to have multiple persistent sessions, each with its own eyebrowse workspaces and ideally its own set of persistent open buffers. Each session would be its own project with persistent window layouts.
 Is there a package that supports this? Not sure if desktop.el is conducive to multiple sessions. For a single session, last I checked, having more than one instance of Emacs when using desktop.el may cause some undesirable behavior when it comes to closing instances and saving them, at least with typical settings.
  
EDIT: C-x t 2 does not preserve eyebrowse workspaces, e.g. If there's 3 workspaces in one Emacs tab, closing one of the eyebrowse workspaces also closes it on the rest of the tabs.

 Thank you all, really. I've spent about 6 days to understand that
 I've just missed thing that outer fmap now takes function fmap (const 'h')
 LOL
 /thread
 Hi, I don't understand how fmap . fmap evaluates, please help. I've spent already 6 days and I don't get it still
 for example:(fmap . fmap) (const 'h') [Just "huy",Nothing,Just "huyhuy"]
 I've understood how we get the final type
 Here it is:
 (.) :: ((g x -> g y) -> (f (g x) -> f (g y))) -> ((x -> y) -> (g x -> g y)) -> (x -> y) -> (f (g x) -> f (g y)) fmap . fmap :: (x -> y) -> f (g x) -> f (g y) (fmap . fmap) (const 'h') :: (b -> Char) -> f (g b) -> f (g Char) (fmap . fmap) (const 'h') [Just "huy",Nothing,Just "huyhuy"] -- -- :: List (Maybe String) -> List (Maybe Char) 
 Here is a full signature
 (fmap . fmap) (const 'h') [Just "huy",Nothing,Just "huyhuy"] -- :: ((Maybe String -> Maybe Char) -> (List (Maybe String) -> List (Maybe Char))) -> ((String -> Char) -> (Maybe String -> Maybe Char)) -> (String -> Char) -> (List (Maybe String) -> List (Maybe Char)) 
 But not I'm trying to understand how it evaluates
 As I understood, composition will apply first and we get this:
 (.) fmap fmap = \x -> fmap (fmap x) 
 Then we apply const 'h' like this
 fmap (fmap const 'h') fmap (fmap (const ‘h’)) [UPDATED] 
 And then we wait for our list, so inner fmap will evaluate first, right? Like this:
 fmap f lms case lms of [] -> [] (x:xs) -> const 'h' Just "huy" : map f xs -- 'p' (x:xs) -> const 'p' Nothing : map f xs -- 'p' (x:xs) -> const 'p' Just "woohoo" : map f xs -- 'p' [] -> [] -- 'p':'p':'p':[] -- "ppp" 
 Am I right? If yes, then how the next fmap will evaluate?
 It doesn't has function applied, just only "ppp"
 That's absurd
 PLEASE, HELP, sorry for english if so

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have more than one Zettlekasten to manage, you may find org-roam to be a bit clunky when dealing with them. The proposed solution in the manual is to have an elist file that locally modifies the org-roam-directory and org-roam-db-location variables. I didn't really like this approach, so I made something better, a very simple function that between a given list of Zettlekasten:
 (setq zettlekasten-paths-alist '(("Main" . "~/Some/Path/") ("Zettlekasten2" . "~/Other/Path/"))) (defun switch-zettlekasten () (interactive) (let* ((keys (mapcar #'car zettlekasten-paths-alist)) (prompt (format "Select Zettlekasten:")) (key (completing-read prompt keys)) (chosen-zettlekasten-path (cdr (assoc key zettlekasten-paths-alist)))) (setq org-roam-directory chosen-zettlekasten-path) (setq org-roam-db-location (concat chosen-zettlekasten-path "org-roam.db")) (org-roam-db-sync))) 
 I have personally bound this to C-c n s since C-c n is the prefix for org-roam related commands. The s stands for switch. You may use anything else of course. Hope you find it useful.
 EDIT: Oops, I made a mistake when first posting this. Make sure the paths in the alist end with a forward slash, otherwise when concatenating to create the database file path you'll end up with ~/Some/Pathorg-roam.db.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am fairly new to elisp, having started on vanilla emacs last month. I hacked together some code to read <leader> key bindings from an org table. It is specific to evil mode and has lots of scope for improvement. Here it is: https://github.com/sooriravindra/DotFiles/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.rsoori/bindings.org
 In my init.el (in the same repo) I check if bindings.el exists. If it doesn't I execute the source block in bindings.org which reads the org table and generates bindings.el
 Please let me know if you have ideas to improve or critique my rather hacky snippet.

 The custom agenda view works fine, however the org-modern faces for the TODO keywords are not applied in the custom agenda view. Even more strange is that the org-modern faces for priority levels do appear in the custom agenda view. I've tried both hooking org-modern-agenda to org-agenda-finalize-hook and using global-org-modern-mode with no success. I'm just not sure where this issue can be pinned down.

 One of my new year's resolution is to get better at emacs lisp, and it seems to me the best way to go about it is to build stuff that I'd find handy. I make heavy use of Zotero to store pdfs and now to annotate them via their pdf-annotator tool, but I was missing some sort of integration with org-roam that would allow me to automagically import the Zotero pdf annotations on the org-roam note for a specific reference. So I wrote some code to achieve this, see https://www.riccardopinosio.com/blog/posts/zotero_notes_article.html. Perhaps some of you will find the idea useful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, when you compile distributed-process, you get a bunch of warnings like "The constraint 'Serializable a' matches instance (Binary a, Serializable a). This makes type inference for inner bindings fragile..." In my own code, I have fixed similar warnings by switching from a class "newtype" to a type synonym. In this case, that would mean changing
 class (Binary a, Typeable a) => Serializable a instance (Binary a, Typeable a) => Serializable a 
 to
 type Serializable a = (Binary a, Typeable a) 
 My question is: suppose I made this change in distributed-process. How might it affect users of the library? I have checked that it has no effect on my own code that uses distributed-process. But I don't know enough to say what the impact might be in general.

Most of the time they come from people starting to learn the language or deciding whether they should invest their time into it (tl;dr they probably should), sometimes from someone desperate who decided to move on to Rust another language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few years I've accumulated a number of notes written in org-mode. I like organising my notes linearly (like a blog), using tags to loosely categorize them. I thought it would make a nice project to build a little web-based renderer for my notes; presenting each note file in a chronological index, where the index can be filtered by date and by tags, and each note entry can be maximised or minimised within the index, or opened in a new page.
 I've kept it very simple, using vanilla JS for the frontend and vanilla PHP on the server. I've uploaded the project to github, where you can find all the sources, some example note entries, a docker file for the server and setup / workflow instructions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that the current emacs has the following flow of code transformation for our elisp codes to take effect:
 elisp -> bytecode -> LAP -> native 
 Note that only with gccemacs does the elisp code makes to the final native phase. Otherwise, if I understand correctly, it gets turned into LAP [1] and controls the emacs event loop (in C) directly. In other words, in this case elisp gets compiled into LAP, and LAP gets interpreted directly.
 Q1. The source code of the bytecode interpreter is under /emacs/src/bytecode.c. How about the source code of the interpreter for elisp and LAP?
 Q2. Are there any known semantic differences among interpreted elisp, interpreted bytecode, interpreted LAP, and native code?
 Q3. What's the current development of JIT compiler for elisp->LAP and for LAP->native? If the JIT compilation flow for elisp->native is finished, will bytecode and LAP be abandoned? If so, when will that happen?

It is used behind the scenes to make bytecode more amenable to optimization, since the instructions are in a structure which is easier to operate on.", quoted from [2, section 1].

 My first steps are always to separate code, divide it on pure & impure functions.
 Pure:
  
It always returns the same result if given the same arguments.
 It can’t cause any side effects.
  
I was thinking that It would be great to mark somehow pure functions.
 I have found that it can be mark like this '(declare (pure t) (side-effect-free t)'.
 But I don't see many functions in emacs codebase mark in this way.
 Why it's not so popular?
 Is based on example below this is the correct way to mark functions?
 (defvar bar 10) ;;; before (defun add-one-to-bar () (setq bar (+ bar 1))) (add-one-to-bar) ;;; after (defun add-one (var) (declare (pure t) (side-effect-free t)) (+ var 1)) (setq bar (add-one bar))

 The problem with this keybindings is that it doesn't work in a terminal. I most use my Emacs in terminal (Windows-dos-box, SSH, tmux, ... in different combinations).
 What whould be a good alternative key-binding here still involving the arrow keys?
 I do use evil-mode and org-mode most of the time.

 This milestone is mainly about incorporating the breaking changes from the `dottyquery` branch (originally by Stefan). That is, features that were dropped or changed in order to support Scala 3 have now been cleaned up and merged. (And `nafg/dottyquery` is rebased on `main`.)
 What's left on `nafg/dottyquery` is mainly just actually making the code cross-build for Scala 3. It still needs a lot of cleanup, but that's hopefully about it.
 Please try it out and let me know if you have any issues.
 And if you need anything that was dropped, let me know -- especially if you're willing to contribute a Scala 3 implementation!

 Nov mode works fine with the EPUB document, and the major mode is named "EPUB". Org-noter doesn't start up, probably because it's looking for a buffer in `nov-mode`. 
  
Does anyone use these packages together?
 
When did NOV change its major mode from `nov-mode` to `EPUB-mode`?
  
I am one of the maintainers for org-noter, but I only use it with PDFs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Link buttons in EWW for example are implemented as text-property buttons with a 'follow-link' property and a 'help-echo' property that encodes the URL to follow. (button-at (point)) when on such a button, returns a marker as the button object; let's call it 'linkbut'. But (button-activate linkbut) fails due to the lack of an 'action' property. If this is considered a button as determined by button-at, then I would suggest that button-activate be updated to utilizes the follow-link property and activate the link appropriately.
 One simple way to resolve this is to start adding an 'action' property to follow-link buttons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I had some enquiries about b2b scala job offers. What I understand is the developer should own his own company so that the contracts is between the two businesses ie the client and the developer. And in some cases there's a talent recruitment firm in the middle. 
 My question is does the job application process differ from normal employment job offers. 
 Does the job application require you to apply as a business or individual say my company is scalaconsults. 
 What if you are a 3 man outfit. All partners in your business, can you still apply for such job contracts. How does the interview process go now that you are more than one.
 Incase of b2b scala jobs on linkedin where do I show that this is my business, this is my crew, this is what I've done. Coz on linkedin it seems like an individual process not business.
 Once your employed can you subcontract the work.
 Sorry for the many questions. Hope there's a kind soul here who can clarify this whole b2b thing for me.

org-publish: systemscrafters YT, it's show note
 ox-hugo documentation site
  
 My use case of blog: 
  
Planning to writing multiple documentations of small projects I work on
 Tutorials of the projects, Tips & Tricks
  
 My Concerns:
  
I'd prefer minimal, (org-publish seemed bit more minimal, but not 100% sure)
 
I want to use separate org-files (on ox-hugo prefers single file for all site)
 I know nothing about HTML/CSS. (I'll face some problems on theme-ing org-publish)
 I've heard about hugo is fast at parsing when there are many files. Would org-publish lag when there is hundreds of files?
 (not necessarily) I'd like to integrate org-roam's back-linking, if it's possible
  
What are your opinion and experience?

 Here is the test code that you can run in your emacs config or in emacs -Q. In my case the result is the same. The new frame does not show options right away. I have to insert a character or press tab to see them.
 (defun test-miniframe-completing-read () "Test miniframe completing read" (interactive) (with-selected-frame (make-frame '((name . "emacs-miniframe") (minibuffer . only) (width . 120) (height . 33))) (unwind-protect (let ((choices '("first" "second" "third"))) (completing-read "Select: " choices)) (delete-frame)))) (test-miniframe-completing-read)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 I want to explore the Erlang style concurrency model library in Haskell which is the cloud haskell project. My first step is to use it in a toy project to send ping-pong messages between two processes.
 I add distributed-process as a dependency and in extra-deps in stack.yaml file, but I get dependency errors. After adding the recommended dependencies, I am finally stuck with incompatible versions of base. The one in the stack lts version and the one in the library hashable do not match.
 I see that there's a config setup for lts-19.28 here, but it doesn't seem to work for me when I create a new stack project with 19.28 resolver.
 Is there any other way I can get this to work? I am using GHCup for managing my Haskell installation and these are the versions if it matters.
 GHCup 0.1.19.2
 Stack 2.9.3

 I used to use just the following for my auto-revert-mode config:
 (global-auto-revert-mode 1) 
 but I noticed it wasn’t consistent in catching changes. So I did some research and found some suggested changes here and here that I tried in my config:
 (custom-set-variables '(auto-revert-remote-files t) '(auto-revert-interval 10) '(auto-revert-verbose nil) 
 This seemed to work more consistently, but I still notice inconsistency in files getting auto-reverted. 
 The one change I haven’t tried is setting auto-revert-use-notify to nil, but I was wondering if I’m missing something obvious in my setup. 
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 if I understand correctly, then the lambda calculus consists of just variables, function application and abstraction.
 Given the term "λa. (λ b. a b) a" can you help me to understand what exactly the amounf of subexpressions of this lambda expression are?
 The lack or use of parentheses both still confuse me. I have read that sometimes most parentheses are ommitted and that the abstraction chooses its body greedily, that is, extends itself as far right as possible. My idea is:
  
The expression itself is a (not proper) subexpression
 The first lambda body extends over all the remaining symbols (?) meaning that we have an abstraction of the form λa. M where M a subexpression.
 M itself is an application again (λ b. a b) a
 a is a subexpression of M
 (λ b. a b) is another one
 Lastly, this is λ b. M' for some M' which in this case is a b. Now is a b an application? It has to be since the language doesn't contain something like Var Var, but it does contain the application (X Y) for some terms of the language, right?
  
​
 It's still a little confusing for me, could someone maybe point me to the right solution? I am sure if I understand this example I should be able to understand most of them. Thank you in advance!

Is there a way I can retain the navigation functionality from the old c++-mode while keeping other treesitter functionality like highlighting, indentation etc?
 Note that when I describe key, bindings like C-M-Spc don't seem to be bound to other custom functions upon enabling treesitter, so I am not sure what's changing their behavior.

 How do I use consult and all the completion goodies to get one of the entries of the elements list?

 Is it possible?
 Is there a better way to structure the entries of the elements list? Maybe something like this:
 (:type "vehicle" :name "train") 
 Sorry if this should be obvious, I am still learning elisp and I am struggling with it. I tried to read the code of the consult-buffer but I could not figure how is the plist SOURCE structured.
 SOLVED: completing-read function is the answer. There is a very nice guide here: https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/alt-completing-read.html

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Doom which packages better-jumper and binds better-jumper-jump-backward to C-o. I use this binding extensively in my workflow and it mostly works well, but there are a few scenarios where jumping backwards doesn't seem to work.
 First, when I'm in Org Agenda and press Enter on a todo item (org-agenda-switch-to) to go to the corresponding org file, I'm unable to jump back to the Org Agenda buffer - C-o takes me to a seemingly random location. I tried fixing this with advice:
  (advice-add 'org-agenda-switch-to :before #'better-jumper-set-jump) 
 but the location in Org Agenda still doesn't seem to be in the jump list.
 Second, when in helpful mode (when looking up docs with e.g. helpful-key or helpful-callable) I can't figure out how to go back after following a link in the docs (i.e. after pressing Enter over a link). In helpful mode better-jumper-jump-backward just doesn't seem to do anything and I'm at a loss as to how I'm supposed to navigate.
 I'd really appreciate any help from those more familiar with setting up these libraries than I am.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just figured out how to encode pattern matching into "De Bruijn Notation as a Nested Datatype":
 {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} module NestedPattern where import Control.Monad import Data.Functor.Compose import Data.Traversable import Data.Void data Term x where Var :: x -> Term x App :: Term x -> Term x -> Term x Lam :: Traversable f => Pattern f -> Term (f x) -> Term x data Pattern f where Bind :: Pattern Maybe Pair :: Pattern f -> Pattern g -> Pattern (Compose f g) instance Functor Term where fmap = liftM instance Applicative Term where pure = return (<*>) = ap instance Monad Term where return = Var Var x >>= f = f x App e1 e2 >>= f = App (e1 >>= f) (e2 >>= f) Lam pm e >>= f = Lam pm (e >>= traverse f) instance Foldable Term where foldMap = foldMapDefault instance Traversable Term where traverse f (Var x) = Var <$> f x traverse f (App e1 e2) = App <$> traverse f e1 <*> traverse f e2 traverse f (Lam pm e) = Lam pm <$> (traverse (traverse f) e) left, right :: Term Void left = Lam (Pair Bind Bind) (Var $ Compose $ Just $ Nothing) right = Lam (Pair Bind Bind) (Var $ Compose $ Nothing) 
 For those unaware, De Bruijn Notation as a Nested Datatype shows to use nested data types to encode debrujin indexes in the type system. In the encoding, an abstract syntax tree is parameterized by their free variables. Lambdas in this encoding simply add an extra inhabitant to their child term.
 My extension here uses GADTs (and HKTs) to make this work with patterns as well. A pattern in this encoding is something that describes how to map free variables, so Bind just adds an extra inhabit like what a normal lambda would do and Pair composes the maps of other patterns.

 I'm studying CS and currently attend a course that involves creating a small project using REScala to give a little introduction to functional-reactive programming (in addition to doing all the necessary research and writing a small paper about it).
 My professor added, that everything we intend to demonstrate during our presentation should not be something trivial like a `Hello, world!` programs or similar, so I figured I might ask here if anybody has some small project ideas that are feasible for a Scala and FRP newbie yet ideally impress my professor.
 Thanks in advance for any help! 
 EDIT:
 I might've added that I am not new to functional programming in general and definitely know my way around (have some experience using various languages, mainly Haskell).

 Im a Univeristy Student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Southampton, and as apart of my Dissertation / Thesis i have created a proof-of-concept tool that combines ideas from the Functional Language Haskell with the Block-Based visual paradigm.
 Ive spent alot of time and effort on this project, and whilst i havent managed to achieve all my goals, im still proud of its outcome and am here to share it!
 You can find the project at https://blockell.netlify.app/, where you can create small programs using blocks to declare functions and generate haskell code. Unfortionately, there are no tutorials for the tool, and to run the code you have to copy it into a haskell file and run it locally on your machine. :( 
 Anyways, if you like the tool, or have any comments, suggestions or improvements feel free to comment them below or answer this anonymous feedback form here: https://forms.office.com/e/nd6sJ3Gq0U 
 Any and all commments with be tremendous help to my project, but also Im just proud of this language and want others to see it :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I've been recently spending a lot of time inside docker containers (or Podman in my case), and because of this, project.el has picked up a project and stored it in the projects file. If Emacs reboots and the container is no longer there, project attempts to open the file in TRAMP, and TRAMP hangs until I press q to allow tramp to exit.
 I can think of two ways to hypothetically fix this:
 The first is by modifying the project-find-functions list. It's a list of functions which are ran in succession until one of them returns a truthy value. My current project-find-functions is (project-try-vc project-try-local). I believe in my case project-try-vc is returning t.
 The second is by telling TRAMP to move on after a failure, allowing the boot to complete even when some projects are not accessible. I'm thinking an advice might be necessary to achieve this.
 Are there any other options? Does anyone out there have a solution to this already?
 Thanks!

 Custom-built binary: Emacs master branch, commit a57a8b. I built using the configure flags in this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/131354i/guide_compile_your_own_emacs_to_make_it_really/

 Both run the same .emacs.d and all built-in Elisp libraries are compiled to eln.

 I have based my emacs config on Emacs Prelude from u/bbatsov, because I did not trust starting from vanilla emacs.
 When starting my emacs, I get a warning saying the the package dash-functional is no valid anylonger and must be replaced by the package dash from the same author,
 Is it some thing I can dom or only the author of Prelude?
 So far, I have installed dashm but it does not seem to fix the problem. Thx for your insights,

How to rebind it? I often struggle with that simple keybinding stuff because of different modes and keymaps. I didn't get the concept of it and often fail of rebind keys.

On a meta-level, it's interesting to me because category theory is a field for which I have 0 (zero!) formal knowledge. I only know some practical applications from programming patterns. That makes writing a note among the lines of "WTF is a functor" a permanent work in progress:  I can only start with my superficial knowledge and expand on it.
That means I'll be keeping one foot in the realm of the known (programming) and one in the unknown (category theory).
While the realm of the known expands with every article I read, I can make amends to this note. This, in turn, means that malleability of these notes pays off very quickly!

 From within Emacs using vterm I can ssh into remote macOS machines just fine. But if I try to connect to the same machine using TRAMP to open the remote user's home directory in Dired it always fails. Or, more correct, it takes ages to complete, never actually connecting.
 This is true for all remote macOS machines I have tried to connect to using TRAMP. None of them uses any fancy oh-my-zsh, the prompts are standard macOS zsh prompts.
 Is there anything specific with remote macOS that messes up TRAMP?

I use Evil package and the prefix key is SPC when in normal mode. The problem is that this prefix is not available in Firefox and such because SPC gets intercepted.
 So, my question is, how do I add C-SPC as an additional prefix key so that both SPC and C-SPC act as viable ways to activate the which-key minibuffer? I would use SPC in Emacs buffers and C-SPC in xorg clients.
 Side question, related to EXWM: Does anybody know why the media keys do not work in full screen videos played in firefox? If the video is not in fullscreen the media keys work, which is really weird. First time I see something like this.

 I have org setted up with elpaca like this:
 ```elisp (use-package org :config (font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode '(("^ *\([-]\) " (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "•")))))) (electric-indent-local-mode -1) (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((clojure . t) (cpp . t) (elisp . t) (haskell . t) (python . t) (scheme . t) (shell . t) (C . t))) (require 'ob-python) :hook ((org-mode . org-indent-mode) (org-mode . variable-pitch-mode) (org-mode . visual-line-mode)) :init (setq org-agenda-files '("~/Notes") org-babel-default-header-args:python '((:results .

 ```
 I tried moving org-babel-do-load-languages to :init.
 I tried moving it at the end of my configuration after (elpaca-wait).
 I tried putting it inside (eval-after-load 'org).
 If I go to an Org file (and I see that the configuration is getting loaded, because things like org-agenda-files appear), and I do C-c C-c on a Python source file, I receive the message No org-babel-execute function for python!.
 The only way it works is if I do ielm and either manually do the org-babel-do-load-languages thing, or I run (require 'ob-python).
 It's been all day and I can't get it to work inside my configuration file.
 Can somebody help me please?

 I tried Helix - too limited for now.
 Neovim - not wanting to do things on my own, I tried pre-built configurations and nothing worked, even after having to upgrade to a PPA to get an up to date version.
 Kate - still too limited but getting there.
 VSCode - ok, this is my fallback for when I need something now and Emacs is not there. It could be my main driver but I don't like Microsoft 's approach to open source and the fact that keybinds are not the same in Linux, Windows and Mac!
 I am using Spacemacs and it mostly works, I just have to work on getting some layout and behaviour the way I like it!
 It looks like I am getting to the point where Emacs will finally become my main (if not only!) editor. Quite a change for someone who has tried many, many times!

Now my emacs appears to hang when waiting for an external process to respond. I can most consistently repro with M-x package-refresh-contents. My emacs then hangs with the "Importing package-keyring.gpg..." message and never responds. Fortunately, C-g gets it to respond again. Here is my backtrace:

After having no luck troubleshooting for hours, I decided to install Msys2 and emacs on my home PC to compare my work PC to a working emacs install. To my surprise, it is broken in the same way on my home PC even after being freshly installed with no custom configuration.
 Anyone have an idea on what the issue could be?

 I then used M-x treesit-install-language-grammar and selected python.

If point is on a heading that has a visible subtree, call org-cycle to fold that subtree.
 If point is on a heading that has a folded subtree, call org-cycle to unfold that subtree.
 If point is on a heading that has no children but is not a top-level item, call outline-up-heading to go to its parent heading, then call org-cycle to fold the subtree that contains the item at point.
  
This would provide an all-purpose 'toggle-visiblity-at-point' command. Maybe outline-hide-subtree / outline-show-subtree / org-show-children would be more efficient in all or some of these cases than org-cycle?
 I could probably cobble something together myself, but having only the most rudimentary grasp of Elisp, it would take me a good deal of browsing forum posts about how to determine heading states / levels plus trial and error so I'm hoping someone here will bite and help me out.

WSL2 cannot not modify Windows NAS drives, even if you mount. A deal breaker for me.
 The Emacs GUI can't be repositioned using Windows hotkeys like native windows.
  
I tried the pre-compiled Emacs on Windows, but it is slower than WSL2. Typing latency is not as good. Trying this sample benchmark, with pre-compiled Emacs, it took 6-7 seconds to finish. With my compiled Emacs, it took 2.6 seconds.

I tried different editors and really liked emacs. I just copied a few people's setup files for my emacs, and I've already lost track of those pieces. 
 I would like to learn some basics in LISP so that I can not only understand some of those setups but also be able to create some quick modifications of my own. 
 Is this going to be a waste of time? Is there a quick guide for someone who has almost zero knowledge of programming? (A computer scientist told me LISP was actually hard to use nowadays, so I should not spend time on this. I should just keep using others' setups for my own purpose.)

 Running xwidget-webkit-browse-url on the saved HTML file works, so it should be be possible. The problem with that is it opens in a dedicated buffer.
 Ideally Emacs would render the HTML with xwidget inside the text/html drawer of the notmuch-show-mode buffer.

I realized that he is using his own libs in project described in book. I'm just wondering if these libraries are actually popular and worth learning. Especialy as a first contact with basic things like managing files, sending requests, connecting with DBs etc.

Announcing ical: A pessimistic iCalendar (RFC 5545) library by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
RFC 5545 is a widely used specification for calendar data exchange on the internet. It defines a data format for representing calendar events, such as appointments, meetings, and reminders.
Drawing trees functionally: Reingold and Tilford, 1981 by William Yaoh
Functional programmers often work with trees; for explanatory or debugging purposes, it is useful to be able to visualize them. I explain one such algorithm for drawing m-ary trees, the Reingold-Tilford algorithm, which runs in O(n) time.

 ZuriHac 2023 is getting closer and we're excited to announce that we will offer a number of 20 minute lightning talk slots to those participating in-person:
 https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2023/#lightning-talks
 Traditionally we've only done invited talks but several people have expressed strong interest in this so we're happy to try it out this year. We welcome submissions for this until the 12th of May.
 We're also still looking for sponsors for this year's ZuriHac! If you are working at a company that's using Haskell, please check if they're interested and get in touch with us -- ZuriHac is one of the best places to recruit Haskellers.
 For more information on the event see https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2023/. Hope to see some of you there!

 So I created a function that takes in a list of lists and returns the list with the shortest length.
 For example, 
 short [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1]] = Just [1]
 Problem is I need it to work for infinite lists too.
 For example,
 short [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2..], repeat 5, [1, 2, 3, 4], [1]] = Just [1]
 How should I go about it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case some haven't been watching, I'll mention that Simon Winchester's new book Knowing What We Know on knowledge to transmission was published by Harper on April 25th in North America. For zettelkasten fans, you'll note that it has some familiar references and suggested readings including by our friends Markus Krajewski, Ann Blair, Iaian McGilchrist, Alex Wright, Anthony Grafton, Dennis Duncan, and Mortimer J. Adler to name but a few.
Many are certain to know his award winning 1998 book The Professor and the Madman which was also transformed into the eponymous 2019 film starring Sean Penn. Though he didn't use the German word zettelkasten in the book, he tells the story of philologist James Murray's late 1800s collaborative 6 million+ slip box collection of words and sentences which when edited into a text is better known today as the Oxford English Dictionary.
If you need some additional motivation to check out his book, I'll use the fact that Winchester, as a writer, is one of the most talented non-linear storytellers I've ever come across, something which many who focus on zettelkasten output may have a keen interest in studying.]]></summary>

A wide variety of domains, such as multimedia, securities trading or compilers,

producing different data processing pipelines tailored to a particular task at hand.
Consider your favorite compiler: it consists of a lexical and syntactical analyzer, a possible preprocessor,
some optimization passes (which can be turned on or off),
various optional static analysis features, a code generator, and so on.
Yet, some of these steps might depend on each other,

 I’m trying to define leader based keybindings similar to doom and spacemacs with SPC as the leader.
 It seems that general.el is the preferred package for this. But I found that evil mode also presents evil-set-leader and allows for configuring prefix based commands. Further we can customize text for which-key prefixes which changes +prefix to +custom_text for instance.
 I’m considering setting up the entire leader based keymap with evil’s existing support. Is there any shortcomings to this? What can general provide me with that I cannot get with evil’s leader support? 
 Appreciate any advice on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently noticed a trend in my workplace where Scala is losing its footing in favour of alternative languages like Golang. Our latest projects no longer use Scala, and we've even gone so far as to refactor some complex legacy Scala code into more streamlined Golang. 
 As someone who loves Scala, it's been a bit disheartening to see this shift in adoption. Has anyone else experienced a similar transition within their organizations? And for those who have, what do you think are the driving factors behind this change?

I don't think anything allows for this (fingers crossed for Pine Note!).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My workflow uses an e-ink tablet for reading (textbooks) and rough note taking (lectures, exercises). My rough notes sync from my e-ink device to my laptop, where I use Obsidian to transform my e-ink notes into more fleshed out notes (Evergreen notes).
 I like being outside and work/study from different places and one hurdle I run into is I don’t have a way of accessing my nice fleshed out Obsidian notes on my e-ink device. Usually I have to have my laptop/phone next to me and reference my notes from there, which is not ideal. 
 Now, this has me wondering if I can warrant myself switching to emacs and org to have my computer notes (org files) easily accessible on my e-ink device. 
 I have been doing a bit of searching and I guess org-publish and then accessing a website on my e-ink device could work. Perhaps mass exporting all my .org files as pdfs/epubs and then syncing them to my e-ink device. (I don’t know if that method could keep backlinks)
 But as I have never used org and this is just my speculation I came here to ask: Is this feasible? Do any of you have a similar setup? 
 Thanks.

I'm not talking about repeated words just as typos or mistakes (e.g., repeating "the the" or similar). I mean some package that, in a paragraph like:
 "This is important as the peaks are mirror images of one another. Upon further inspection, these images show another interesting features. The most important [position of point]"
 would point me/highlight the fact that the "important" I'm writing is a repetition within the active paragraph. Knowing this, I could easily think of a synonym and instead of writing "interesting" I would write "relevant". This could seem like a simple task that the user can perform without aid, but the point is that in long paragraphs, this repetitions are hard to spot without re-reading the whole thing, which usually breaks the flow of writing.
 Does anyone know of a package (or a way) to accomplish such a thing?
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I edit a lot of LaTeX and use xenops to generate LaTeX previews.
 Recently I've been wanting to change themes sometimes, but xenops generates snippets with bg/fg colors based on the currently set theme. I'd like to be able to change the bg/fg colors dynamically based on the current DOOM theme. 
 I've successfully written a function that changes the XML data to the new bg/fg color of the xml in-place, and hooked it to doom-load-theme-hook. However, xenops still renders a new preview for the exact same text.
 For example, say i have a xenops LaTeX snippet 
 \(S^1\) 
 generated for the theme doom-zenburn.
 I can change the theme, and the XML file for the associated to the above snippet has its colors updated. In fact, if the preview is visible inline, and I change the theme, the preview changes its colors. This is expected behavior.
 However, when I enter the LaTeX snippet and exit it again, xenops regenerates the snippet for the new theme. Is there a way to prevent this? I don't want to generate new snippets per theme as this would take up unnecessary disk space and compute resources.
 My gut tells me it's not possible. Xenops seems to generate svgs with random names, but I'm not sure how it decides to choose which svg to show in-buffer. Anyone have any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm 4 months into a new job and have struggled a fair bit, mostly in my own personal time, to set up a developer environment that doesn't involve completely dropping my personal values.
 This mostly led me down the path to the simplest Vim on WSL2 install I could manage while trying to use Window's sometimes unreliable WSL2 interop. Things don't always work easily in this manner, especially when the rest of the team knows how things work one way, and I'm on a completely different track.
 Well, I've installed my old friend Emacs as a native app on Windows and was gobsmacked by how little I had to change to get things productive.
 Why use a VM when I can just install the Emacs operating system inside of Windows?
 I know proprietary software is a touchy subject with GNU folks. I just wanted to express my gratitude for being able to help feed my family with a shred of software freedom.

Then it goes on to say that the XDG-compatible location is in ~/.config/emacs. This is all well and good, and I want to use the XDG-compatible model, but I still have ~/.emacs.d which appears to contain my elpa, melpa, and org libraries that I've installed. I'm just getting going with this config, so I haven't installed much yet.
 Is there a way to make the packages install somewhere else? I'd rather have them in $XDG_DATA_HOME, which for me is in ~/.local/share. Or do I just accept that ~/.emacs.d will be there always and use emacs -l $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/emacs/init.el to startup my emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/orgmode!
 I'm seeking some advice on how to effectively use org-roam. I'm particularly interested in hearing how others utilize org-roam in their workflows.
 I've developed a system where I create index pages for each major subject. These org-roam files are tagged with :index: and usually left empty. 
 For instance, if I were learning Python, I'd create three index pages: Python, Theory, and Examples, with the last two having backlinks for the first one.
 When I take notes related to a particular subject, I create a new note and insert a backlink to the corresponding index page. This way, when I need to find a specific note, I can simply visit one of the index pages and review its backlinks, instead of trying to remember what name i gave to the specific note.
 While this method has been somewhat effective for me, I'm wondering if there might be a more efficient or more organized way to approach this. I'd love to hear about any tips, tricks, or workflows you use in org-roam when learning new topics.
 Thanks

  (use-package projectile :ensure t :diminish projectile-mode :bind (("C-c p f" . helm-projectile-find-file) ("C-c p p" . helm-projectile-switch-project) ("C-c p s" . projectile-save-project-buffers)) :config (projectile-mode +1) ) (use-package helm :ensure t :defer 2 :bind ("M-x" . helm-M-x) ("C-x C-f" . helm-find-files) ("M-y" . helm-show-kill-ring) ("C-x b" . helm-mini) :config (helm-mode 1) (setq helm-split-window-inside-p t helm-move-to-line-cycle-in-source t) (setq helm-autoresize-max-height 0) (setq helm-autoresize-min-height 20) (helm-autoresize-mode 1) (define-key helm-map (kbd "<tab>") 'helm-execute-persistent-action) ; rebind tab to run persistent action (define-key helm-map (kbd "C-i") 'helm-execute-persistent-action) ; make TAB work in terminal (define-key helm-map (kbd "C-z") 'helm-select-action) ; list actions using C-z ) (use-package helm-projectile :ensure t :config (helm-projectile-on)) 
 And when I try opening a file through projectile-find-file I see the ansi color escape codes appearing. Anyone knows how to fix this thing?

 Also, can anyone share an experience of using http4s in a prod environment? What are the specs of vm it needs to handle 1000 rps?

(->) :: Cat Type (for covariant mapping)

 Hi there! I've been trying to troubleshoot this issue for several hours but I haven't got any success.
 My code in my init.el is like this:
 ```
 (setq org-directory "/Users/myname/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Org/")
 (add-to-list 'org-agenda-files "/Users/myname/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Org/tareas.org") ```
 However, when starting emacs I get this:
 ``` Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/Users/myname/.emacs.d/init.el’:
 Symbol's value as variable is void: org-agenda-files ```
 I have double checked my path but I'm still getting that same error every time I start emacs.
 I have this in my org-agenda-files variable description:
 org-agenda-files is a variable defined in ‘org.el’.
 Its value is ("/Users/myname/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Org/tareas.org") Original value was nil
 I'm completely able to see my agenda because tareas.org is recognized correctly, but only after I go to my init.el and manually evaluate the function. When I start emacs the agenda is empty. 
 Thanks!

 What are your approaches and stuff you use? I have been using org-hyperscheduler and that has been really nice!

 Also, when using TODO/DONE they get highlighted. How do I add more words to that list?

 I've been looking into emacsclient and it seems this may do what I want, but I wanted to ask if anyone has any experience with this. My emacs is lightning fast (native-comp), so outside of avoiding duplicate emacs instances, I would have no other use for it (simply a convenience thing).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs community!
 I've recently developed my first Emacs package called say-region.el
 , and I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have. This package allows users to send a selected region of text to speech synthesis ('say' command(, which reads the text out loud using the default text-to-speech voice. 
 I would be grateful if you could provide any comments, improvements, or suggestions you may have. Please feel free to submit pull requests, report bugs, etc
 say-region.el
 An Emacs package that sends a selected region of text to be read out loud using the default text-to-speech voice. 
 https://github.com/smoge/say-region.el
 Installation
 ​
  
Clone the repository or download the say-region.el
 file.
 Add the following lines to your Emacs configuration (init.el
 or .emacs
 ):
  
​
 (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/say-region.el") (require 'say-region) 
 Replace /path/to/say-region.el
 with the actual path to the say-region.el
 file.
 Usage
 ​
  
Enable say-region-mode
 in a buffer:
  
​
 M-x say-region-mode 
 ​
  
Select a region of text in the buffer.
 Press C-c s
 to send the selected region to the say
 command, which reads the text aloud.
 To stop the speech, press C-c k
 to kill any running say processes.
  
Limitations
 This package is designed for macOS and uses the macOS-specific say
 command. For the moment, it is not compatible with other operating systems without modifications.
 Contributing
 Feel free to submit pull requests, report bugs, or suggest new features by opening an issue on the GitHub repository.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks for reading folks!
 I've just updated to an experimental Emacs build (30.0.50) and prayed on first run .. but my existing massive .emacs came up pretty well, only a couple of gnits. One of the warnings was not to use docker-tramp anymore due to the built in tramp-container.el
 At a quick glance of the .el and errors it produces, I'm getting the feeling that was designed around local containers (Docker running locally with the Emacs), but not for a remote container
 For example, I use Tramp via multi-hop, so that I can ssh to a server where the containers are running, and run the docker ps and open a shell within the images _over there_
 So a bookmark would look something like:
 /ssh:[foo@someserver.com](mailto:foo@someserver.com)|docker:bar@container:/path/within/docker
 tramp-container.el looks like the same syntax (/docker) as docker-tramp, but I wonder if it only works locally?
 I'll have to try docker-tramp again and see if remote still works there, or am I out of luck on this astoundingly handy behaviour. (or perhaps a local docker daemon can reach out to remote docker daemons, or I can run some ssh tunnels to pretend local is remote, or something..)
 edit: Looks like I had a defcustom override for the docker tramp so it was using 'sudo docker' on the target very old system; so I added a override tramp-docker-program for the new module, but still no dice. (Currently experimenting with things like /ssh:foo@someserver.com|sudo::|docker:bar@containername:/path but still no dice)

 I have friends I would love to chat with, either using Android or IOS phones, I am trying to push them to use other chat / IM protocols than iMessage or Whatsapp, and I would like to chat from my emacs (last resort, from my terminal)
 What chat/IM protocols are the better supported in emacs (28 - 29) that offer good support on mobile apps?
 - Signal Messaging (send-only from emacs so not optimal)
 - any other??

 How do you like it? Can it be made more efficient or concise? Can you somehow get rid of the splitImpl function and do everything in one function (without showing it into a lambda)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I may be missing something stupid. When I put links in Org-mode files they appear normally, i.e. the whole [[/link][caption]] thing is hidden and I just see the caption with an underline, can click on it, etc.
 I also have my Emacs configured (somehow) to color characters overflowing my fill-column something jarring, and I usually use auto-fill-mode and have no problems with that.
 For example if I have fill-column set to 3 and have a line abcde, de will be colored to mark they're over the line limit.
 However, it seems that whatever's coloring my isn't taking into account what Org-mode does to hide links. So if I have a link [[/link][caption]] which has 18 characters in its raw form but only 7 (caption) are getting displayed, those 7 characters count as 18 characters towards the line limit!
 For example if I have fill-column set to 20 and have a line [[/link][caption]] foo, I expected to see no characters marked as over the limit because I'm seeing just caption foo, but in fact the final oo are marked as over the limit because in that regard it counts as a 22-character line.
 Sorry for the verbose explanation. Does anyone have a solution for this? I could make the color less jarring but this is lowkey driving me crazy.

​
 sudo dnf install systemd-devel 
 ...before you build (and librsvg2-devel if you want treemacs to work) and all will be well.
 if you don't, then because the service is set up as polling, SystemD will start up the daemon and wait for it to say "I've started". Emacs, not having been built with SystemD support will never send that message, and so SystemD then kills it after a time-out (and then restarts it, which is only polite).
 If you don't want to build SystemD support into Emacs, but still want to run it as a daemon via SystemD (for whatever reason, I'm not judging) change the type flag in the emacs.service file from notify to simple.

 It's not such an interesting video; the immediate impression I get from the video is that the firm had a spaghetti Python codebase, were looking for something to migrate into, and they coincidentally had a moderately-skilled Haskeller on the team who was able to Just Do It and hack together something that worked, whereas the Rust attempt got stuck at the borrow checker and OCaml didn't have the libraries available for the task.
 ​
 On the negative side, they were unable to deal with Haskell's laziness semantics and had to enable strict for everything. Same thing happened with NoRedInk; they just wanted Elm for backend, Elm's BDFL locked down the compiler and kicked all the backenders into Haskell, and NRI ended up putting Strict into their Cabal / Stack files.
 ​
 You can also tell that there's some level of tension; the Haskell engineer is relatively bubbly, but her boss seems offput and somewhat horrified that they went with Haskell and that's messed up their power dynamics.

 (defun call-api-function () (json-parse-string (request-response-data (request "<URL>" :type "GET" :sync t ))) ) 
 then I use another function to to parse the output from the call-api-function
 (defun parse-output-function (callback) (let* ((content (call-api-function )) (output (gethash "output" content)) (finish (gethash "finish" content))) (when (= finish 1) (cancel-timer my-timer) (apply callback (list output)) )) ) 
 then a third interactive function to run the parse-output-function
 (defun query-api () (interactive ) (setq my-last-point (point ) my-timer (run-at-time 0 1 'parse-output-function 'callback))) (defun callback (output) (save-excursion (goto-char my-last-point) (insert output ) ) ) 
 when I move the cursor to anywhere in the buffer and start typing the function parse-output-function suddenly stops printing anything which means it has stopped working, but its entry in the list-timers is still there.
 I don't know what I'm doing wrong here but I guess it is just a basic pooling where I keep requesting content from the API until the finish flag is set, then I cancel the timer, but this all suddenly stops when I go somewhere else in the buffer and start typing anything.
 Thanks in advance.

 ``` ;; the next two lines make tabs into 4 spaces

 Specifically, when I type M-o RET read(2), I would like it to open in a new window to the right, not below. I have my Man-notify-method set as friendly.

 I teach Haskell at the university. Every year I have a problem setting up everything on school computers. Especially for testing during midterms and finals.
 So I made a small repo with scaffolding for GitHub Classroom. It includes devcontainer. So it can be used in browser with complete Haskell environment (in codespace). No need for any local installation. Of course it can be used locally with VS Code. Also autograding GitHub action is set up. It uses HSpec for testing.
 If this is useful to anyone you can find repo here:
 https://github.com/Idokorro/haskell-exam-autograding
 It's nothing much. It's an empty project. But it took me a while to set everything up. Maybe it can save someone some time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just switched to elpaca and was pleasantly surprised how fast it was to spin up a new installation (minutes down to seconds). But I'm surprised to see how much faster startup time is. I had spent a lot of time tuning my config with use-package, and was pretty pleased with a seven second startup. I use emacsclient, so this only really mattered when tuning the config and restarting - but still acceptable.
 But with elpaca, my startup time is just over a second! (measured via time emacs --eval "(save-buffers-kill-terminal)" It's possible that some of this is due to no longer loading things that have been added into Emacs over the time that my configuration has grown (when was org-mode made native??) - and a side benefit of elpaca is that it complained about this and made me fix it.
 But does multi-threading improve both installation time AND start-up time?

 I am currently using nov.el to read some e-books in Emacs and I am having trouble justifying the text. I have tried using the justify-kp package but the code provided on https://depp.brause.cc/nov.el/ doesn't seem to work for me.
 I was wondering if anyone could help me out with this issue or provide me with some working code for justifying text in nov.el using justify-kp. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi newbie question. I am coming from OOP background and have some difficulty understanding how Haskell treats what in other languages I would call "functions overload (by return value)" 
 The following code does not compile 
 foo 5 = "5"
 foo 5 = 5 
 Compiler tells that it "cannot deduce ...". OK, get it. The compiler infers the function type from first foo definition and cannot match second definition with this type. However consider this. I can define infinite instances of say type Applicative Functor a for different types a, with multiple function definitions of "pure" that takes operator and returns something of type Application Functor a. Eventually it is the same multiple functions definitions which only differ by return value. 
 Why then it is allowed?

I have worked already with it on my university's computers but want to install it on my own to practice more. I hope this question isn't too obvious and makes sense, but I saw the command needed to install said it must be done by a non-root/non-admin user. I use the main user on my own computer so I have admin permissions and would prefer to just install it there for practicality. So my questions mainly are, am I understanding the requirement right? Will I have to switch users to install it? What would happen if I just do it on my regular main user session? Would appreciate it if anyone can help. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Typescript programmer by day, but I am learning Haskell by night, I have just finished reading Learn you a Haskell and I've built a simple blog using Scotty and Blaze, and I also worked a little with Aeson. That's all my experience with Haskell. And having experience working with Typescript, which has a lot of really cool typing features, I'm wondering if one can replicate them in Haskell. Specifically, my question is about type mappings and conditional types. In Typescript, one can define an interface (basically, a record type):
 ```ts interface Person { name: string; age: number; married: boolean; }
 interface Profile extends Person { friends: Array<Person>; job: { title: string; salary: number; onVacation: boolean; }; } ```
 And then it's possible to create a new type out of this one by recursively replacing all numbers and boolean with strings:
 ```ts // This type gets a type argument T and recursively replaces all its boolean and number fields with strings type AllStrings<T> = { [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] extends number ? string : T[Key] extends boolean ? string : AllStrings<T[Key]>; };
 function parseBadJSON(badJSON: AllStrings<Profile>): Profile { // mapping logic } ```
 Moreover, you can see record type inheritance with extends keyword.
 I had a task at my job where I needed to parse a JSON that stores all values as strings, and I needed to map it to a JSON with numbers and booleans, where they were supposed to be, so that's how I achieved the correct typings for my mapping function (parseBadJSON). How would you do that in Haskell?

 Keep in mind, this was created for educational purposes solely, and there are certainly better ways to go about such interop.

 Something where I can see all the reads would be ideal, so that I could do something like M-n within man-mode to browse through my options, or even something that can see whether I'm in a shell buffer, or in C mode and grab the relevant man page.

 I'm having an issue with my Haskell code and I was hoping someone could help me out. I have two methods, a and b, both of which use the space function that accepts zero or more spaces. The a method works correctly by skipping over any spaces and then parsing the input " a". However, when I execute the b method with the input " a", it gets stuck in an endless loop.
 I suspect the issue has to do with the use of the "many" function in "space", which is causing the endless loop when b is executed. However, I'm not quite sure why this is happening.
 If anyone could shed some light on this issue and explain why the b method is causing an endless loop, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance!

 https://github.com/jimeh/yank-indent
 It’s the first package I’ve written in years, so I’m more than happy to hear any feedback and/or criticism, as I’m fairly out of the loop :)
 My goal was for the package to be something you install and enable once and never have to think about again, as it enables itself in relevant buffers only, and ignores buffers (YAML, Python, Makefile) where it would cause issues.
 If anyone is curious of the hacky solution I used to have in my config, here is the comment where I initially replaced it with an earlier version of yank-indent.

 In the example below if the user selects an ice cream I want to show the ice cream options and hide the pie options. If the user selects a pie I want to clear the ice cream selection, show the pie options and hide the ice cream options.
 (transient-define-prefix restaurant-menu () ["Main Course" ("m" "main course" "main-course=" :choices ("hamburger" "cheeseburger" "chicken sandwich"))] ["Dessert" ("i" "ice cream" "ice-cream=" :choices ("chocolate" "vanilla" "strawberry")) ("p" "pie" "pie=" :choices ("apple" "cherry" "pumpkin"))] ["Ice Cream Options" ("c" "chocolate sauce" "chocolate-sauce") ("s" "sprinkles" "sprinkles") ("w" "whipped cream" "whipped-cream")] ["Pie Options" ("r" "crumb topping" "crumb-topping") ("w" "whipped cream" "whipped-cream")] ["Order" ("o" "order to dine in" order-food-dine-in) ("g" "order to go" order-food-to-go)]) 
 I tried :if predicates, but it seems they only evaluate upon initial prefix setup, not when values change.
 I also experimented with the Setting up another transient manually in the Transient Showcase, using transient-setup to dynamically replace the current prefix with a new similar one, but with ice cream or pie options. It looks like the same transient with the dessert options dynamically changing. The problem there is that it nests the child transient, so you have to type C-g twice to exit. It's also a little inelegant as I copy and paste most of the transient definition into the two variations. It seemed like the wrong tool for this job.
 Is there a way to dynamically hide and show infixes in transient based on the current argument values of other infixes? Or is there a more appropriate UX pattern to use for this scenario with transient?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A literate org mode document that tangles, using noweb an org file into a theme file is a nice way of organizing themes by the files and sections they customize instead of by the sections needed by the file. See: https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org
 Details:
 I spent the weekend setting up my own color theme. What I did not like about how this is done is that the color theme file is broken into sections by the need of the functions to define it. What I wanted to do was to setup the theme organized by the mode or functionality. Since others sharing has helped me in the past, I thought I would share this with the community. (See: The Proximity Principle at https://kula.blog/posts/proximity_principle/)
 I had been using the following techniques anyway, so I was most of the way there:
  
Used GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles (Brandon Invergo' Using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles: https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html
 Used literate config file using org-babel. This lets you write an org file with emacs lisp source code blocks that are saved to an .el file when it is tangled.) See Literate Programming here: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming
  
But, this still made me sequence the code in the sections that the theme file required. I did not want that. So noweb came to the rescue. Using noweb, you can have a source block that will include references to source blocks defined in other areas of the org file. This allowed me to organize the file the way I wanted to. The top of the file is the skeleton for the theme file with the sections defined, and the sections below each add to the theme section as they need.
 In case you missed it above, see https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org for the full details.

 Hello Haskell community, I'm making a desktop program in Haskell (mainly for fun and type safety) as a frontend for another GPL licensed program. However I'm not very good when it comes to licensing.
 GHC and almost all Haskell libraries use BSD style licenses. I do not know if I can use these BSD libraries on my program that is distributed under GPL. I would like to distribute my program under GPL due to it's copyleft nature. Is it legally possible?
 Can someone please help me clarify?

 There seem to be many packages that manage sessions (bookmarks, bookmarks+, desktop, desktop+, burly, persp-mode, etc.).
 ​
 What would be the simplest implementation of the following functionalities:
 ​
 - Saving opened buffers into a list with a given name
 - Opening buffers from a list by selecting the name of this list
 - Deleting a list of buffers by selecting its name (not deleting the files, just the list)

 The only example is function fromFuture, it turns IO[Future[A]] to IO[A] but throws Throwable if Future failed, giving no way to handle error. So why not just using IO or Defered instead of fromFuture?
 Can you give me some examples or explanations about this? Any viewpoint will be appreciated.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I write a demo code to describe how async be used, but it doesn't work.
  @Test def testAsync: Unit = val completableFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() => { Thread.sleep(2000) 5 }) val secondIO: IO[Int] = Async[IO].async(cb => Sync[IO].delay { // action: call this callback // Invoke the callback with the result of the completable future val stage = completableFuture.handle { case (a, null) => cb(Right(a)) case (_, e) => cb(Left(e)) } // val: a finalizer // Cancel the completable future if the fiber is canceled Some(Sync[IO].delay { println("cancel on Async") stage.cancel(false) }.void) } ) val attempt: IO[Either[Throwable, Int]] = secondIO.onCancel(IO.println("cancel on MonadCancel 1")).attempt val trace: IO[Unit] = attempt.onCancel(IO.println("cancel on MonadCancel 2")).flatMap(value => IO.println(value)) val task = for { fiber <- trace.start _ <- fiber.cancel outcome <- fiber.join _ <- IO.println(outcome) } yield () task.unsafeRunSync() // throw an AssertError Assert.assertTrue(completableFuture.isCancelled) () 
 The finalizer doesn't work, why?

 What my current process is:
  
Open Shell buffer
 Navigate to the folder my .py file is in

 source myenv/bin/activate
 Return to Python buffer
 m-x pyvenv-activate
  
Step 6 above will only work the first time I set it all up, after that it doesn't seem to do anything! Only way to get it working again is to delete the virtual environment and set it up again, I don't want to do this every time I re-open my program. So as I said, I've been just been going to shell buffer and doing source myenv/bin/activate every time and then just running my code from there rather than the Python buffer.
 Any advice how I am supposed to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, it is a bit (to say the least) frustrating. I have two libraries: one is using UTCTime from Data.Time, another TimeSpec from System.Clock. I've searched through Hackage/Hoogle and could not find any easy way to convert between them. The only way I can come up with is to base calculations on current time which is both inefficient and convoluted.
 Does anyone have any ideas?
 EDIT: some context.
 I am trying to cache JWT token validation results using https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cache. Cache expiry has to be specified using TimeSpec. JWT tokens are parsed and validated using JOSE which in turn provides token expiry using UTCTime.
 EDIT2: rant. I am new to Haskell but it is sometimes a frustrating experience (although I am positively surprised in general: Nix + Haskell Flake + HLS + VSCode is a pretty nice interactive dev environement) - compositionality is one of the main advertised advantage of the language. In practice it is very often difficult to combine different libraries as they are based on some incompatible concrete types (in this case cache could have abstracted away the actual time representation as it is not really important to its operation)

My simple function here calculates multiplying an investment and removing some % profit, outputting a list of net profit as repeated each of n times:
 mtp x y z = [ ( investment * ((flip*percent)^n)) | n <- [1..6] ] where investment = x percent = (100-y)/100 flip = z 
 So for example mtp 1000 10 2 outputs:[1800.0,3240.0,5832.000000000001,10497.600000000002,18895.680000000008,34012.22400000001]
 Based on using :t to check, type declaration is currently:
 mtp :: Double -> Double -> Double -> [Double] 
 but still giving me those long decimals

 The first one is the one mentioned in the title. I'd like to make sure some cleanup code is executed when leaving the transient, however that may happen, with transient-do-quit or with C-g, whatever. But I can't seem to find a way to do that. I even tried to create a suffix overriding C-g but couldn't get that to work. I also tried (desperate measures...) to advise the transient and wrapped it in unwind-protect itself, without success. So, is there a way to ensure some code is executed after the transient? 
 The second is that I'd like to let bind a variable while the transient is active. Is there a way to do that?

 Ideally, I'd like something like the Emacs UI; hierarchical bullets, which are collapsed by default and that you can toggle on and off. "Expand all" and "collapse all" would be nice to have too.
 Another nice bonus is if I could this just by importing some JS in the generated HTML header, without requiring any extra package.

I was wondering if any of yall knew how to change the defaults. I'm not sure if this is a Magit-related configuration, or if it's a Git configuration.
 Any and all help would be appreciated!

 TL;DR - Okapi, a web framework that I started working on last year, now uses an Applicative instead of a Monad. This has made the framework a lot more consistent and easier to understand. It also makes it possible to automatically generate OpenAPI specifications from your endpoint definitions. It should be possible to generate clients as well, but I haven't worked on this yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I'm currently taking a Functional Programming course, and we are using Haskell. I had a really hard time setting everything up, but I think I finally have something that is somewhat working. I'm using a M1 Mac so I decided to install ghcup using brew. I then installed everything else haskell related using ghcup (stack, cabal, ghc, and hls). When I then started working on my assignment the code had some imports like Random and HUnit. So in order to get that to work I tried to install those using Cabal. At this point I noticed that I also needed llvm so I installed llvm@13 using brew and added the path to $PATH. I then did cabal install --lib random and it worked! However, I have found out that this is probably no the preferred way of using cabal and I wanted to switch to a stack project which leads me to my question.
 Is there a good way to remove this libraries that I installed? I have found that the files are installed in the .cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7. In this folder I have HUnt-1.6.2.0-18526221 and rndm-1.2.1.1-c70f7c08. Can I just remove those files? Or is there a better way to do it? I basically do not want random and HUnit to be installed for every Haskell projekt I'm working on moving forward. Some noteworthy things might be that when I do cabal list --installed they don't show, but I can compile the code without any issues.
 I hope I was able to explain my issue and appreciate any help I can get. If there are any issues with the way I installed llvm or haskell stuff that would also be extremely appreciated. It feels like I have spent way to much time on just setting stuff up and would need to start doing some actual programing...

 ​
 These two languages come up because they're enormously popular languages with large ecosystems that recapitulate many of the benefits of Haskell, and for which hiring is relatively easy.
 ​
 Rust, for instance, captures much of Haskell's correctness, missing only HKTs, although the development of Generic Associated Types promises to duplicate much of the capability of Haskell higher-kinded types.
 ​
 What's more, Rust has stable memory use and performance characteristics, and while the black art of pushing Haskell to C speeds hasn't wholly died, Rust in general outperforms Haskell both in time and space complexity.

 opens emacs to the org-agenda dispatcher where I have to either type a, n, or one of the other options. I then need to type n to get the view I want, but how can I pass it directly so it opens my agenda view without the extra keystroke?
 The command
  $ emacs -f org-agenda-week-view

 I had a problem: every file I open has a delay of up to 5 seconds before I even saw it. This is definitely an issue with eglot+clangd because when I disable it completely everything works just fine. Then I set eglot-sync-connect to 0 and it helped with opening the first file of a project.
 How can I speed up opening other files in a project? This is my profiler report for opening a file with projectile + swiper. The delay before I can interact with emacs was about 3-4 seconds.

 P.S. lsp-mode + clangd has the same issue.

 Nerd-icons.el also provides unified experience in TTY and GUI.
 Nerd-icons currently supports dired, minibuffer-completion, treemacs, doom-modeline, and more on the road...
 As a heavy user on both mode, this is a killer feature to me.

 Do you know what are the workflows of the key contributors of Emacs? I am talking about key role people like Eli Zaretskii and Po Lu.
 I know that Richard Stallman has expressed it here:
 https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html
 But, I did not find much about other key contributors.
 I am specifically interested in their approach at using Emacs and I am asking because that might teach me something new or perhaps help me re-evaluate how I use Emacs.
 Do they use the default Emacs keybindings?
 What packages do they rely on?
 For which tasks do they use Emacs?
 What other software do they use and why is Emacs not suitable for covering those needs?

 This would be useful because some of my documents have a LOT of headlines, and I currently have to scroll a lot to see the matches of org-sparse-tree. Is there a package that does this? If not, any rough idea of how to hack org to do this?
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm beginning the process of writing a JIT compiler for a custom DSL that will be embedded in a commercial product. Though I come from the Rust world, I figured this would be a great opportunity to learn and use haskell for my compiler.
 2 days later and I'm still failing to get a project to build with the LLVM bindings. The repository seems fairly inactive, is many versions behind modern LLVM, and recent github issues documenting build issues have been met with silence. This seems like a very basic package for a language that is supposed to be well suited to writing compilers. I did not expect to have this issue at all. Even flipping Python seemingly has more up to date LLVM bindings.
 So I'm sadly considering abandoning using haskell for my project. Are there other bindings I'm not aware of? Is there some other way people do code generation?
 I would love a solution because I was looking forward to learning haskell.
 Thanks for the advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[no-littering used to set backup-directory-alist so that all backup files are created in ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/.
 (Even if you don't use no-littering, check the value of that variable. I suspect that many users have themselves customized that variable to put all backup files in a single directory, in which case they would also be affected.)
 If you use emacs/emacsclient as EDITOR and an external tool opens an unencrypted file containing some sensitive data in a directory on a tmpfs file-system, then the backup file would by default be created in the same directory, so it would not hit a disk and be discarded after a reboot.
 Note that this only affects you, if the visited file is not encrypted. So if you, for example, visit ~/.authsource.gpg, then the backup file is also encrypted, regardless of where it resides.
 Please update to release 1.3.0 or snapshot 20230420 and delete all files ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!tmp!... and ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!dev!shm!....
 This gets you back to how Emacs behaves by default.
  
The default isn't so great either. No backups are created for files in /tmp, but for files in /dev/shm backups are created. To prevent that you would have to use a custom backup-enable-predicate function. (If you don't do that, then the backup files sticks around until a reboot, but at least then they get discarded.)
  
This issue was discovered a day ago (https://lonely.town/@wasamasa/110227701055899570) and was reported an hour ago (https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering/issues/200).
 In the future, please report security issues privately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m just getting started with org-mode in Emacs and am looking at options for keeping my org files in sync between computers — specifically, between two Macs. A complication is that on one of the Macs I am limited in what software I can install, for work-related reasons (for example, syncthing might not be an option, Dropbox is probably OK, as is iCloud Drive).
 It’s most important to me that the syncing should be robust, reliable, and secure. I’d like to have files sync automatically in the background, rather than having to trigger a sync manually before leaving one machine or starting on the other. Similarly, it would be good if I don’t have to remember to close all buffers before I leave a machine (i.e. if conflicts and simultaneous editing aren’t a problem, or at least that resolving conflicts doesn’t risk losing data). Also in terms of avoiding data loss, I’d like to be able to make backups of the files, ideally with versioning in case I need to go back and fix something.
 End-to-end encryption would be desirable if it’s cloud storage (which might make iCloud Drive preferable to Dropbox). Being able to sync to an iOS app like Beorg would be nice too, but is less important.
 However, one concern I have about iCloud (apart from some suggestions that it's not always reliable) is that it seems like you can’t always guarantee that all files are really stored locally on the Mac, rather than only in the cloud, even if you don’t select “optimize storage" (see for example https://eclecticlight.co/2022/02/21/can-you-back-up-icloud-documents/ ). So, it seems that backup solutions aren’t guaranteed to be able to see and backup the files stored in there (if they happen to be online only). Otherwise, I’d be happy to do my own backups of the directory with something like rsync to my NAS.
 Are there any solutions that fit my wishlist, or am I being too demanding in what I’m looking for? Any pointers would be very welcome!

Typical of when I'm in class, my note take is slowed. More accurately, my refactoring of notes into atomic-sized notes has slowed. I will add as many words to my ZK, but each note is bigger. Because of the speed of the class, I don't feel I have time to refactor the notes I've captured from reading, say, "Read Hot Epic." I keep all the ideas captured from the story in a single note, hoping to atomize the note sometime. In the meantime, I have all the ideas, and because of my search skills, the ideas are not lost.
@Sascha's article Why the Single Note Matters is a real eye opener. Care and attention must be paid to each and every note. The effort in this practice is what is called zettelkasting. The rewards are a supportive ZK partner. If you consider this a downside, the downside is that this activity siows time. You will naturally slow down. In a non-pressure environment, this is a good thing. Not so sure it works in a classroom setting with a schedule to keep up with.
I've started a list in my journal of projects to advance once I've completed the food writing seminar. That way, they can be off my mind and safely on a list. (Classic GTD principle)
I'm reading - Fisher, M. F. K.. The gastronomical me, Penguin Random House Publisher Services. 1989.

Testing concurrent code using DejaFu requires the use of MonadConc and MonadSTM instead of plain IO and STM. Is there any performance impact, and if there is, can it be recovered?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm using Emacs version 29.0.90 (Development version 2b10e1827d3b) and I keep encountering the issue in subject when I install a package. That is, Emacs seems stuck (I waited for multiple hours) while scraping files for loaddefs. If I stop the process (C-g) and restart Emacs, I get the error:
 Error loading autoloads: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory /home/marcop/.config/emacs/elpa/<pkg-name>/<pkg>-autoloads)
 Do you have any suggestion on how to debug?
 Cheers
 --- EDIT 1 – 2023-04-20 12:26
 Actually, not all packages create this issue. So far, I identified csv-mode, ess, org-contrib, and polymode as problematic packages.

While a broad biography of a seminal figure in the development of art history in the early 20th century, there are some interesting bits relating to art and memory as well as a mention of Frances A. Yates whose research on memory was influenced by Warburg’s library.
Of specific "note” is the fact that Aby Warburg (1866-1929) had a significant zettelkasten-based note taking practice and portions of his collection (both written as well as images) are featured within the hour long documentary. You'll see it in the opening scenes in t…]]></summary>

 I am trying to get skewer-mode to work, in particular, I want to see changes I make to html files in emacs to be automatically updated in the corresponding browser window. I have tried to follow the descriptions on the package's GitHub page and also this Emacs Stack-Exchange post, but neither of these affords me the "live change" I seek, and most other guides don't regard HTML, but only CSS or Javascript (which I'll also need, but that's for later).
 Do you know of any good guide that you can recommend, or do you have personal experience with this package and care to share some insights?
 Also, while I'm at it, I am also open for tips when it comes to webdev. I currently use `eglot` and `tagedit`, which makes editing quite a bit less of a hassle, but I still miss the coziness of editing lisp with `sly` and `paredit`.
 Have a good day, folks :)

The book (Turabian) said the utility of a storyboard versus an outline, is that you can easily move information around. This made me think of org mode, which I already use productively for outlining. 
 So I know it already can do the basic task of storyboarding as is. However, I was curious about whether org mode could display information more like a "storyboard." Either horizontally or (maybe better for not having to scroll so much) tiling.
 I imagine this would work with the top level heading defining a card / unit and then units would be displayed horizontally or in a grid, rather than a vertical list.
 Is this something that already exists?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fourmolu is a formatter for Haskell source code. It is a fork of Ormolu, with upstream improvements continually merged.
 0.12 comes with some pretty notable changes: * GHC 9.6 support * A new single-constraint-parens option for disabling the feature of adding parentheses to contexts with one constraint * A new column-limit option for breaking lines at a given length (as much as possible) * A new --print-defaults CLI flag for generating a default fourmolu.yaml config file
 With this release, we're also excited to announce a new website: https://fourmolu.github.io! The website contains a web app where you can paste in Haskell code, change configuration values, and see the result. It also contains docs for each of the configuration options with examples. As this is the first release of the web app, there are bound to be bugs and things that could be improved, so please write an issue for anything you find in the web app!

 Long time user of emacs (since 1994 or 5 using emacs in terminal on a sun sparc workstation) but not a long time init.el file customizer. But now I'm trying to fix some things that really bug the crap out of me and this is one. I use which-key (because my memory sucks), but as you see from the gif, it shifts the buffers in the main windows. Is there a way to prevent this so that when the side window goes away, the buffers (and cursor position) remain at their original position?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On two different laptops on different networks, with or without .emacs, it just freezes for a couple of minutes. I feel like it has only been in the past year or so that I have experienced this. 
 I've used the profiler, but there's nothing to see, it's just opening/saving the file.
 I've looked at task manager and I'm spotting any culprits (the two machines have different AV setups).
 I'm using the 64 bit 28.2 version on both machines. 
 I've chased all over the internet looking for things to try and nothing seems to make a difference. I've been using emacs in one version or another since the 80s and this is the first time I'm considering giving up on it. 
 Using docker or cygwin is a possibility on one of the machines, but not the one I use for client work.
 Any ideas?

 I am writing elisp code to programatically assign a property to a heading.
 I use the API to parse the buffer and I select headings for further processing:
 (let ((buffer-ast (org-element-parse-buffer))) (org-element-map buffer-ast 'headline (lambda (hl) (when (= (org-element-property :level hl) 1) ...))) 
 Here hl is a headline, and I want to get and set its properties (the stuff in the :properties drawer). I am reading the documentation for the API (API documentation link) and the Syntax (Org syntax link), but I don't get how to get or set a property.
 Thanks for your help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am still trying to get two-way sync'ed calendars working in Emacs (it seems to me this is the most under-developed aspect in the Emacs eco-system).
 I found vdirsyncer which seems like a nice and promising idea similar to maildir which I already use with notmuch, even though it seems too opinionated and the support for Google calender seems largely untested/unsupported.
 More annoyingly, Microsoft Exchange calendars do not support CalDAV which means one must use tools like davmail. I've had little success getting DavMail to work with two-factor authentication and vdirsyncer also warns that davmail can lead to data loss or strange issues (davmail seems too big, being in Java, for me to hack around). 
 Has anyone had success using Exchange calenders in Emacs? What is your workflow?
 Is anyone using vdirsyncer with Google and/or Exchange? Any hints you can share?
 Thanks!
 PS: I've asked a similar question before and I know of org-caldav, which still requires a CalDAV proxy and org-gcal, which only works for Google.

 Back when I discovered flyspell, it was (for me) a big leap forward in usability and speed. I've used it since, until now. Even so flyspell is nice, it still made editing feel a bit sluggish. Therefore I enabled it only, when editing prose and never while coding.
 But jinx is so fast and non-disturbing, I keep it globally enabled all the time.
 You might like it, too. :)
 (I'm using it on Linux, and do not know how well it works on other OSes, since it utilizes libenchant.)

 Does anyone know how to get these?
 I am using Doom Emacs with emacs 29, I installed the treesitter package from doom. (I know it is built in in emacs 29, but this was still active from my config from emacs 28)
 I active treesitter with `(global-tree-sitter-mode)` and `(add-hook 'tree-sitter-after-on-hook #'tree-sitter-hl-mode)` in my config.el.

 I want to parse a simple line with a Regex.
 Regex match will return a Maybe (Array (Maybe String)). I'd like to lift the inner array. Is there a library function that does Array (Maybe a) -> Maybe (Array a) (or even Array m a -> m Array a)? I can't find anything with that exact signature on pursuit, but I'm not crazily experienced using it... ;)
 Also, is this a very bad approach? My target files have some lines matching the regex and others that don't. A valid line will match all groups, and I need to access all of those groups individually in the next step.
 I'm also not that fluent yet in the group theory speak...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a problem that intrigued my mind which i solved lately.
 I have many org files under a Dropbox directory. And also i have a scratch.org file on my desktop. I have wanted an easy way to refile all headings from scratch.org file to files in dropbox. I thought of an elisp form at the top of the file which will act like a button by evaluating with eval-last-sexp command.
 I also wanted this refiling thing for the files in Dropbox. Every file would refile to a specific file.
 I couldn't create those elisp forms that will act like buttons easily. It was harder than i thought. I found org-refile function hard to work with programmatically. 
 After wasting so much time about this problem, i found a rather simpler and maybe even intuitive solution.
 I add local variables to each org file. An org-refile-targets and org-archive-location variable for every file. This solution doesn't give a one click way to refile all headings to a file, but it does give a simpler and focused way to refile and archive headings to specific org-files. 
 I found this solution very satisfying for my workflow. If is there anyone wasting 4 months in order to setup their essential org workflows, i hope this helps.

Capture someday-maybe items as entries with a date 2 weeks in the future
 I evaluate everything in that file every week. If I want to keep the item, I promote it by either moving it to another file, or removing its timestamp.
 For each item, if I haven't promoted it by the time its timestamp rolls around, then org-mode deletes the entry
  
This means I want a plugin or a command or something that will delete items with expired timestamps. I looked through the org manual, and found C-u C-u C-c C-x C-s (https://orgmode.org/manual/Moving-subtrees.html) that will archive items under these circumstances. I want to delete them.
 I suppose I could set up the archive file to be /dev/null ! I'll try that and see what happens.
 [EDIT] I tried to set #+ARCHIVE: /dev/null::%s at the top of the file in question (someday.org), but when I archive using C-c C-x C-a it sends it to ./someday.org_archive instead.
 [EDIT2] I just made it re-read the file and tried again, this time I got the answer that /dev/null isn't going to work :( File exists, but cannot be read Copied: Subtree(s) with 19 characters funcall-interactively: Buffer is read-only: #<buffer null> 
 [EDIT3] I've made peace that someday.org_archive is workable - I'll just think of it as landfill. So where I'm stuck currently, is to make org's capture template set a date 2 weeks in the future when I capture an item to someday.org. I looked through the org manual's entries on capture templates again, but it doesn't look like there's an answer for this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Release Candidate version of Indigo (a Scala 3 pixel art 2D game engine for Scala.js) is the result of six months work and will hopefully become a full release after undergoing a bit more testing. Feel free to take it for a spin! 🚀
 It contains a good number of general improvements that are based on real usage during the production of our biggest demo to date, hopefully coming soon-ish!
 The main bulk of the work is a total replacement of all GLSL based shaders in favour of programs written using Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet is a Scala 3 shader program writing library that is currently aimed at WebGL + GLSL. The purpose of this work is to begin to separate Indigo from Scala.js and WebGL, so that the project can look at supporting other rendering technologies (WebGPU is the next likely target), and one day, other platforms like the JVM and/or Native. Custom GLSL shaders will still be supported for the for the foreseeable future, but existing shaders will require very minor modification to be compatible.
 Indigo's website is slowly going through a necessary rebuild, so for now it's advisable to check out the release notes below if you decide to try this version out. Alternatively, do come and say hello on our Discord server if you need any help, or even just to show off what you're making. 😁

 I am quite stuck with trying to think of a way to implement a createDecisionTree function. But first, some background!
 Here's the DecisionTree datatype, which is pretty much just a Rose Tree
 data DecisionTree a = DecisionTree a [DecisionTree a] deriving Show 
 I am trying to explore the Decision Tree of a game by modelling the different states one can take from a particular state
 possibleGameStates :: GameState -> [GameState] 
 There's a possibility of a lot of overlapping GameStates, so I introduced a Set into the picture
 uniqueGameStates :: SET.Set GameState -> GameState -> ([GameState], SET.Set GameState) uniqueGameStates alreadyExplored g = let allPossFiltered = filter (\x -> not (SET.member x alreadyExplored)) $ possibleGameStates g newSet = SET.union (SET.fromList (g : allPossFiltered)) alreadyExplored in (allPossFiltered, newSet) oneLayer :: SET.Set GameState -> [GameState] -> ([[GameState]], SET.Set GameState) oneLayer s [] = ([[]], s) oneLayer s (g : gs) = let (iRes, newSet) = uniqueGameStates s g in (iRes : fst (oneLayer newSet gs), newSet) 
 I want to write a createDecisionTree function 
 createDecisionTree :: SET.Set GameState -> GameState -> DecisionTree GameState 
 But I have no idea how to compose oneLayer together with uniqueGameStates to create the DecisionTree. Oh, and btw, I have a inEndState :: GameState -> Bool function as well for the base case of createDecisionTree. I have no idea what the recursive case looks like. Help!

 Just this weekend I decided I'll give neovim a chance. I started making my config from scratch and found it MUCH easier. Followed some videos and after 2 days I have something I really like and more importantly I understand every snippet of code that went into the config.
 I miss some things. The commands pallete on doom was amazing. Every command, every keymap all just there. Magit is a godsend. So is org mode.
 I have no doubt I will eventually hop back to emacs but neovim has given me the confidence to be able to write my own config. 
 What do you guys think?

 I am curious as to what colors you use for the different levels of headings and if there is some logic behind it...
 Do you simply pick random colors based on gut instinct or do you subscribe to some color theory?
 Or do you differentiate the different levels in another way - using different font-sizes maybe? Or maybe different fonts AND different colors?
 What is your style and why (I am looking for some inspiration...)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I've tried LSP so many times and I'm too frustrated with how difficult and hard it is to configure. Trying to look at other people's configs for this is a nightmare.
 I wanted to ask: Does anyone have an Emacs config that configured LSP or Eglot mode along with proper indentation that 'just works' for the following modern web development frameworks and languages:
  
React
 Vue
 Ruby On Rails
 JavaScript
 TypeScript
 Python
 HTML
 CSS
  
​
 Anything related would be wonderful as I'm sick of trying to fight Emacs to even get this to work properly, even when indentation is concerned.

 I'd like to be able to continue from a session (window/tab layouts) when I reconnect over ssh.
 Is there some way to get emacs to save the previous session so that when I ssh back (after disconnecting) I could continue from a previous emacsclient session the way tmux allows attaching to an existing session?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know TRAMP slowness is a recurring topic here, but I didn't see a suggestion on this particular phenomena yet, so asking for advice.
 When I connect to a host at work, TRAMP is trying to find version control configuration all over the file system on the remote host. Git / Bzr / Hg / Svn, in current directory, one directory up, and up, and up... I can trace it in the debug buffer it is taking more than a minute to finish this process which is awkward. I am working from Eastern Europe via VPN, and the remote host is in the US, so it takes a couple of hops while one command completes.
 Is there any way to prevent these checks? I care about version control on my local machine only.
 Thanks.

One inconvenience is that when I run `helm-find-files` under a Windows mount (e.g. /mnt/c/Users/me/Downloads) once, then I later add a file under that folder, and then I run `helm-find-files` again, the latter doesn't seem to update and show the latest files added. Dired and shell work correctly. Also regular files under ~/ work as expected. What could it be? And how could I have an up-to-date output with `helm-find-files` even in mounted dirs? Thanks!

 In Doom Emacs, the frame appears as soon as Emacs becomes ready for usage. How is that? Doom Emacs says it took 0.7 seconds to startup, while my vanilla emacs config took 0.37 (i already tweaked early-init), so i guess the DOOM Emacs' devs have configured it so that either the messages do not appear in the echo area or the frame appears only when emacs becomes ready for usage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For my own reasons, I've come to use the di- prefix to mean half, in opposition to bi- meaning twice. This has affected me in that difunctor seems to be an older / alternative term with the same meaning as profunctor, as is evidenced by the Profunctor class itself:
 haskell class Profunctor p where dimap :: (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> p b c -> p a d lmap :: (a -> b) -> p b c -> p a cw rmap :: (b -> c) -> p a b -> p a c 
 It is actually quite awkward, this straddling of both pro- and di-. The type class name uses the pro- terminology (as in pre, and post), but the functions use the di-, l-, and r- terminology. This is unfortunate, as the Profunctor thus claims essential parts of both terminologies.
 For quite some time, I've actually thought of these in my head as promap, premap and postmap, as I have my own orthogonal use case for the di- nomenclature, having derived another dimap (and rmap, lmap) - but they clash in name with the existing profunctor functions, even though prodifunctor and prodimap in my nomenclature are actually sensible classes worth exploring. Privately I've been content with masking this, as I have alternative ways of deriving names, but I thought it was worth discussing with the community.
 What are your thoughts on the positives and consequences of changing the Profunctor nomenclature such that dimap = promap, lmap = premap, and rmap = postmap?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently migrated from straight to elpaca. I'm generally very pleased with the results, but there is one issue I don't know how to resolve, even after reading the manual and trying various searches online. The issue is pretty simple: I don't seem to be able to get elpaca to load updates to any use-package expression after Emacs has started.
 For example, let's say I want to set the value of the user option org-hide-emphasis-markers to t in my config file. I then add (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t) to the use-package section of org-mode:
 elisp (use-package org :demand t :config (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)) 
 (Assume for simplicity that I have no other org-mode customizations.)
 To test the effects of this change, I run eval-last-sexp with point at the end of the macro. However, nothing happens: the new value is not set.
 I thought this may be related to the asynchronous nature of how elpaca handles packages. But evaluating (elpaca-process-queues) has no effect.
 Apologies if I'm missing something obvious.

 Specifically, a C/C++ programmer may have some fun using OpenCL, vulkan or coda on NVIDIA hardware. I know that there are bindings for scala to many of these libraries but honestly I don’t see using them in a functional context to add much wrt the imperative way, instead they tend to be more limited in scala.
 Even more, recent devices like rk3588 are equipped with a NPU, is there a way to have fun with it with Scala?
 What’s your thoughts about this? ZP

 For example, say we have a simple expression language...

 We can define a "debug print" for an Expr which prints its tree structure. Taking inspiration from the example from the recursion-schemes docs, we can use an effectful fold in Reader that keeps track of the current depth:
 type Depth = Int debugPrint :: Expr -> String debugPrint e = runReader (cata debugAlg e) 0 where debugAlg :: ExprF (Reader Depth String) -> Reader Depth String debugAlg e = do depth <- ask let (name, body) = case e of NumF n -> ("Num " ++ show n, []) AddF e1 e2 -> ("Add", [e1, e2]) MulF e1 e2 -> ("Mul", [e1, e2]) ss…]]></summary>

Seeing that he was left org-mode for a new tool, discouraged me from using Emacs and building my own config. It also encouraged me to try Logseq, which is one of the most popular PKM tools alongside Obsidian.
 He says in the tweet:
  
It gives me a lot of what I've used Emacs org-mode for in the past, but with a less fussy interface and less temptation to tinker. (Moving from a system best described as Big Bag of Google Docs, per topic or person.)
  
For me, it was the opposite. I was never as productive as when I was used Emacs. Logseq out of box is very powerful in some aspects, especially in handling multimedia. For example, you can embed a YouTube video and take notes based on …]]></summary>

  In the dependencies for aeson-2.0.3.0: time must match >=1.6.0.1 && <1.13, but this GHC boot package has been pruned (issue #4510); you need to add the package explicitly to extra-deps (latest matching version is 1.12.2) needed due to script-0.1.0.0 -> aeson-2.0.3.0 
 after adding all that to extra-deps i get

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new release of SBV is now on hackage, supporting quantifiers, quantifier alternation, quantifier elimination, and skolemization. This allows users to express and prove first-order logic theorems. (Of course, the underlying solver---typically z3---may not be able to determine theoremhood, since first-order logic is semi-decidable. However, modern SMT solvers can handle most instances that come up in practice.)
 Here's a simple example:
 Prelude Data.SBV> :set -XDataKinds Prelude Data.SBV> sat $ \(Forall @"x" x) (Exists @"y" y) -> y .== (x + 1 :: SInteger) Satisfiable Prelude Data.SBV> sat $ skolemize $ \(Forall @"x" x) (Exists @"y" y) -> y .== (x + 1 :: SInteger) Satisfiable. Model: y :: Integer -> Integer y x = 1 + x 
 A set of first-order-logic examples are included in the release. As usual, bug reports, comments, and contributions are most welcome at the github repo.
 Happy proving!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've developed pure Haskell quicksort on mutable vectors while aiming to match performance of std::sort from C++. While not really hitting that bar, the result is within around 20% in sequential mode and is faster in parallel mode.
 In addition, the package exposes reasonable default sort for most users suitable for just importing and sorting without thinking twice what's going on under the hood.
 Parallelisation is implemented via both sparks and threads and the method is selectable. Unfortunately threads don't show much speedup but users can define ther own, hopefully faster, methods to parallelise. Sparks-based parallelisation is much faster but unfortunately will use all available capabilities at runtime so it's less controllable.
 The repository is https://github.com/sergv/vector-quicksort and the benchmarks are under https://github.com/sergv/vector-quicksort#benchmarks.

 but I didn't like having to keep this list updated even though it only required executing re-executing a code block. It also required passing each table as a variable into the code block for generating the big table like:
 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :var chaos=chaos-hw devil=devil-hw ...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scala.js's answer to Elm-like frontend dev has had another update, featuring improvements to WebSocket's and the Http client, as well as a variety of user facing enhancements. Full release notes can be found here:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.6.2
 If you want to see Tyrian in action, check out the amazing all new Rock the JVM "The Typelevel Rite of Passage"* course to watch the build of a full-stack web application from scratch! It's an excellent introduction to Scala.js.
 https://rockthejvm.com/p/typelevel-rite-of-passage
 Also keep an eye out of Daniel Ciocîrlan's recent Scalar Conference 2023 talk when hits YouTube. (Hopefully soon, I hear good things and can't wait to see it!)
 If you'd prefer to read about it, Gabriel Volpe's brilliant new book "Functional Event-Driven Architecture" includes a bonus chapter featuring Tyrian, in which he ports his trading app from Elm to Tyrian.
 https://leanpub.com/feda
 https://github.com/gvolpe/trading/tree/main/modules/ws-client
 Tyrian's giter8 template has also been brought up to date, meaning that you can get your first Tyrian app up and running in five minutes flat! Give it a try, what's the worst that can happen?
 sbt new PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian.g8
 Many thanks, as always, to Tyrian's contributors and community. I love it when people drop into our little Discord server to show us what they've been building!
 (* Please note that while the course and book mentioned above are both based on the Typelevel and Cats Effect ecosystem, Tyrian works with any compatible effect type, and we have a small but growing number of Tyrian+ZIO users too.)

 I'm trying to find a concise name for a special pattern of using return type values as a place to collect evidence about an underlying implementation.
 The essence of the pattern is to replace what would usually be Unit with a new, distinct type. On the trait definition level, the return type is kept abstract, so that each implementation can decide for itself what it means for it to be correct. On the implementation level, however, the type is defined such that it enumerates what evidence is necessary to consider this specific implementation correct. When multiple levels of traits/implementations are at play, the evidence is propagated from level to level in its abstract form.
 The following example should give you a general idea of what I'm talking about:

 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library enabling developers to attach constraints (also called "refinement") to types. These constraints are evaluable at compile-time and/or at runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive = 5 //OK val y: Int :| Positive = -4 //Compile-time error! val z: Int :| Positive = -4.refine //Runtime exception. Variants for `Option`, `Either` etc... exist 
 Check the Github page for more information.
 Features of v2.1.0
 New error messages
 Iron now has enhanced compile-time errors, clearer and more explicit.
 ```scala def log(x: Double :| Positive): Double = Math.log(x)

 I have come across Alex(https://serokell.io/blog/lexing-with-alex) and Happy which are libraries for scanning tokens and parsing but as a beginner I would like to look at code that uses Haskell directly. There is a toy grammar for this.My goal is to learn FP for this use case so that I can use the new pattern matching features using records in Java.
 I can compile and execute Haskell( or Ocaml ) in Spacemacs.
 Is there a book for that ? I know about Appel's books. I am particularly interested in patterns like zipper which I have already coded. Are similar patterns useful for parsing and scanning ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm looking to migrate to vanilla emacs, and I thought I'd kick things off by asking you all for advice.
 I'm terrible at emacs, but I've been managing to limp along with it as my primary driver for a good number of years now. I used vim for many years, but then I switched to spacemacs for some time and moved on to doom a little while back. I absolutely love the idea of a modal space menu, and the evil integrations have been fantastic for me.
 BUT. Even though they're great projects, I'd really like to be done with things like spacemacs and doom. They've been a great way for me to see what's out there, but all the built-in customization makes it really hard for someone like me to understand where various behaviors are actually coming from, and at least a few times I've discovered that after much hair-pulling what I thought were plugin bugs were actually problems with the customization layers. I feel like I always end up stripping away as many of the customizations as possible.
 My use case is essentially solid support for C++, maybe some python and glsl, and that's pretty much it. I know eglot & clangd/ccls work well for the c++ part, which i feel covers quite a bit of what I need. With eglot and things like use-package becoming a part of emacs in 29, I'm really getting the itch to just build things up from vanilla emacs, so that I know exactly what is custom and what isn't.
 External things I know I'd like:
  
spacemacs-style menu (is this a package?)
 magit
 ranger for file browsing
 evil integration everywhere possible
  
What major headaches do people see lurking here if I'm keeping things pretty minimal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to explore emacs and I'm struggling with some of the concepts that I'm so used to with vim. Here are two basic things that are very easy in vim but I am not sure how to do in emacs. I've tried to look in the manual but I just don't seem to grok it.
 ​
 1) Run an interactive command with arguments. The problem I'm trying to solve is to repeatedly load a file. (Yes, I know about M-x eval-buffer). In vim, I can call the :source command with an argument, for example:
 :source ~/.vimrc
 I can then even type : and hit the up arrow, or :so and hit the up arrow and it will recall from my history similar to bash's Ctrl-r.
 In Emacs, M-x load-file (or :load-file since I use evil) doesn't seem to accept an argument. I'm forced to hit RET, and then the name of the file. Let alone not having…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a very simple toy project using spago. I'd like to add the purescript-postgresql-client library as a dependency, but it apparently doesn't exist in the package set.
 I apparently need to add this package, along with its dependencies, to packages.dhall. Should I just be copying the list of dependencies out of the Spago.dhall file from the package's repo? If so, why can't Spago just do that for me when it gets the package and builds it?
 Also, what happens if the package gets updated upstream and the dependencies change? How am I supposed to keep the list in packages.dhall up to date?
 I'm mainly used to the Cargo/crates.io ecosystem so apologies if I'm fundamentally misunderstanding some concepts here.

 there's a specific type of buffer where I can't view non latin characters (hebrew in my case). In all other buffers and minibuffer pop-ups hebrew characters are presented fine, but I'm using prot's `denote` package, which creates a backlinks buffer (nvm exactly what that is if your unfamilliar) using xrefs - and the text in that buffer gets displayed withe characters' numbers, but not the actual letters.
 I have the following in my config file:
 ;; UTF-8 as default encoding
 (set-language-environment "English")
 (set-language-environment "UTF-8")
 (set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8)
 (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
 (set-input-method 'hebrew-full)
 ;; do this especially on Windows, for python output problems
 (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
 And I'm using Doom emacs on windows.
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi community,
 as syntax is contentious a topic as ever, David (the main proposal author) and I would like to invite you to give your input on https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/585, where we propose to change the syntax of the accepted proposal #522 introducing Or patterns. In particular, we'd like to know
  
Whether you like the syntax ((one of 1,2,3), 4) in the original proposal better than the amended one mirroring case of: (one of {1;2;3},4)
 
Whether you like that it is subject to layout, similar to case of, e.g., 
 f (one of 1 2 3) = 4
 Which looks kind of funny here, but perhaps has foreseen use cases.
 
Whether you think it's good or bad to allow f (one of {}) (with layout just f (one of), even), and whether the semantics should be a strict match (mirroring case x of {}) or lazy (like case x of _ -> ...)
 
If you have experience with writing tools for GHC Haskell, whether mirroring case of syntax poses new problems for you, especially caused by it being subject to layout rules
 
 (Note that we understand that you might not like either syntax. That is fine, but the linked proposal thread is not the place to have that discussion. In all honesty, the syntactic appearance is not why we like Or patterns, rather the opposite.)
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, my emacs started having all sorts of problems connected to utf8 characters. I think I traced the problem back to emacs not opening my init.el with utf8 encoding for some reason. I set utf8 characters as the values of several variables in init.el, and this causes problem in other buffers even when emacs determines the encoding of these other buffers correctly.
 I tried using #'recode-region and #'set-buffer-file-coding-system to reencode init.el, but if I restart emacs it keeps detecting the file as "no-encoding". I also tried using (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8-unix) but that didn't help either.
 I'm out of ideas. Does anyone have suggestions for what else I can try?

 Today I wanted to write a set of functions to communicate with hammerspoon (the idea is to display in the menu bar the name of the task clocked in, and a continuous update of the time spend in it). I was able to complete my goal faster using chatGPT. When the task is clocked out, reset the menu bar.
 Here is example of what it shows "[0:07] (doing som.." truncated so it does not take too long

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello all! i’m new here but no stranger to emacs!
 ever since macOS decided to drop emacs, I’ve been wondering for quite awhile what terminal editor is intended to be used instead? I’ve been focusing on using nano (in both Ubuntu and macOS) for about a year or two and I’ve discovered I can’t unlearn emacs bindings after using it for over 25 years - it takes *more* effort to slow down and translate what I want to do into a nano binding which just doesn’t seem efficient to me (not to mention all the times I’ve had to undo my mistakes!)
 I‘m well aware I can just install emacs through homebrew and just wondering what alternatives exist out there compatible with emacs bindings? [and I’m not looking for anything fancy - 95% of the time I’m just doing basic editing of a config file or README.txt]
 I could have sworn there exists a lightweight terminal editor compatible with emacs bindings included with macOS now and I can’t find any reference to it so thought I’d wave the white flag and post here!

 I have the following snippet in my init file to add some custom searches for rg:
 (with-eval-after-load 'rg ;; Provide some custom searches for Lisp libraries (rg-define-search rg-emacs-lisp "Search the Emacs lisp default libraries." :dir "/usr/local/share/emacs/" :flags '("--search-zip") :files "*.{el,el.gz}" :menu ("Emacs Libraries" "b" "Built-in")) (rg-define-search rg-emacs-elpa "Search Elpa packages." :dir package-user-dir :files "all" :flags '("--glob=!*.elc") :menu ("Emacs Libraries" "e" "Elpa"))) 
 With that snippet, right after startup, if I call M-: (featurep 'rg) the answer is t. But, if I comment it out, the answer is nil. So that bit is triggering the loading of rg. But, since it is set (with-eval-after-load 'rg ...) I'd expect this to run only after rg is loaded for some other reason. How does trigger the loading of the package? Is there any way to make these settings while avoiding the loading of rg?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a long time vim user, just started to use emacs a few weeks ago. And there is a feature I like so much in neovim that I wonder if it is possible to acomplish the same in emacs:
 The file tree displays a sign next to folders that have uncommited changes when in a git repository, and also shows a sign when the file or folder contain some error detected by the LSP. Like in the following image:
 nvim-tree
 Is there a way to do this in emacs? I use neotree, but I would be comfortable using any other file tree plugin if I could get this behavior.
 Thank you very much in advance!

 11-1: Document Title (or more accurately this chapter's title)
 INDENTED (1) Some stuff in paragraph form about the intent behind document, etc
 INDENTED (2) Some more stuff
 11-2: Next top level heading
 ​
 Reddit dumped the indentation, so I added "INDENTED"

 I watched some videos on Scala-Native and saw that the Java libraries which are used to some extent by Scala for the JVM are NOT usable for Scala-Native. Does this mean some parts of them have to be rewritten in Scala? how else might their use in the JVM world be replaced for the Native world?
 Is this a project new people can join? I'd love to see some good compiler writers join the project to get it moving along quicker.

 I'm very new to emacs, my journey has been vim followed by VSCode and now I want to dabble with emacs. I managed to set up evil, which was very straight forward but now I am struggling a lot with everything with typescript. 
 I've identified that I need lsp-mode, lsp-ui, tree-sitter, dap, tree-sitter-langs and tide to have a decent environment up and running. I have the following script setup:
  (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "nongnu" (format "http%s://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/" (if (gnutls-available-p) "s" "")))) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t) (package-initialize) (require 'use-package) ;; EVIL (require 'evil) (evil-mode 1) ;; DAP-MODE (use-package dap-mode) (setq package-list '(dap-mode tree-sitter tree-sitter-langs)) ;; TREE SITTER (require 'tree-sitter-langs) (require 'tree-sitter) ;; Activate tree-sitter globally (minor mode registered on every buffer) (global-tree-sitter-mode) (add-hook 'tree-sitter-after-on-hook #'tree-sitter-hl-mode) (setq package-list '(dap-mode tree-sitter tree-sitter-langs lsp-mode lsp-ui)) (use-package tree-sitter-langs :ensure t :config (tree-sitter-require 'typescript) ) ;; LSP (require 'lsp-mode) (add-hook 'prod-mode-hook #'lsp) (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l") (dolist (package package-list) (unless (package-installed-p package) (package-install package))) 
 I've installed the packages but don't really see anything. No syntax highlighting, nothing. Any clue where to even start?

Competitive programming in Haskell: topsort via laziness by Brent Yorgey
In this problem, we have a directed acyclic graph where each vertex represents a person, and there is an edge p -> q when person p sends their finished envelopes to person q.

 In the first buffer, I push escape to go to normal mode, and then I switch to the second buffer.
 In the second buffer I will still be in insert mode.
 Not really consistent with vim, and annoying if I want to quickly switch back to another buffer but not realising I'm in insert mode and typing some shit. Now I got to back space and go to normal mode before switching.
 Any simple way to fix this? Both google and chatgpt have been less than helpful.

My interest in them stems from Domain-Driven Design and software architecture. With this blog post I’d like to explain why I think that state machines are a great tool to express and implement the domain logic of applications.
Moreover, I’d like to present crem, a new Haskell library to build state machines, and explain why Haskell plays an important role in making crem special.

The origin: Domain-Driven Design and state machines
If you are familiar with Domain Driven Design, and Event Storming in particular, you have probably already seen the following picture:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone, I created a curated Scala jobs aggregator FairJoin.com - right now it has 350 Scala jobs from 80 Companies. I created it because I've been a Scala Engineer for the past 10 years and it's always been a pain finding jobs that actually use Scala. 
 An example of why it's a pain: LinkedIn claims to have 30,000+ Scala jobs, but you click on most of them and they say "Requires experience with languages like Python C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Rust, Go, Scala, or Kotlin". They just use Scala as a keyword, and you'll never actually use Scala in that job.
 With FairJoin I review every job posting to ensure it has a high likelihood of actually using Scala. It's early stages, but some of the next features I plan on adding are filters for things like location and Scala specific attributes (i.e. Functional, Akka, Cats, Data Engineering), as well as more company info.
 ​
 I hope it's useful, and I'd love to hear your thoughts either here or email me at stephen@fairjoin.com

A few months into it, people started talking about using straight.el instead of package.el, so I moved my configuration over to using straight.el. However, now people are saying package.el is the best option and that people should not really use straight.el anymore. I have had good experience with straight.el since some packages I like are not on melpa. Additionally, I have tried downloading and using emacs-29, and it seems to run into issues when using straight which makes me lean more towards using package.el unless there is some way to fix this. Which package manager should I use, and why (I have also heard about elpaca which seems to have nice UI and fixes some issues that straight has, so what about that versus straight and use-package)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On April 20th at 19.30 UTC, I'll be speaking with Simon Peyton Jones, one of the team behind Haskell, on a YouTube livestream. 
 Simon is renowned for his work in lazy functional languages, and I'll be exploring his career of building languages, especially Haskell, but also C-- and most recently Verse. We'll dig into his work at both Microsoft Research and Epic Games, and exploring the lessons we can take from a monumental career. At the end we'll put your questions to him in an AMA.
 Everyone is welcome to come and join in and ask questions. You can set a reminder on YouTube.
 The interview is part of Exercism's #12in23 - a year long challenge to encourage people to try 12 new languages throughout the year. So far, I've interviewed José Valim (Elixir), Louis Pilfold (Gleam), Cameron Balahan (Go), Josh Tripplet (Rust), and  Bjarne Stroustrup (C++) - they're all available to watch back on YouTube!

 I used to use CEDET 15 years ago, and I liked the way it kept the layout fixed, with a lower buffer (similar as to VSCode does it) "capturing" all what could be considered process-output. And then up on top I'm free to do whatever.
 Is there something comparable? I'm wary getting CEDET itself into my life, as all its tools seem to be pretty dated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a short "introduction," I am a 16 year old student from Canada. I've been programming since I was 12, although it wasn't much until I was 14. I picked up python initially so I could "show off" to one of my friends, but I ended up getting hooked on writing C until about halfway through last year, in which I started learning Haskell. I'm firmly convinced that I won't leave Haskell anytime soon, as everything just feels superior to how I was doing stuff before, even if it was harder initially (and still, to a certain extent.) I want to eventually work in I.T, but I'm unsure of the availability of Haskell developer entry positions for once I could actually fathom getting a job working as a developer. I know I'm young and not locked into using any 1 language / stack, but I'm still kind of just wondering what I should consider doing for the future? Thanks!

 My fasting started from 20:05 last night and expects to end on 12:30 today. I firstly tried to calculate the interval by formula "$5=24-$2+$3;U",but it compute a wrong result. So a new column Format 24 hours should be added.
 How could get it done without a cumbersome new column of 24 hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an application where, in my domain types, I have an Event which has many Tags and belongs to a single Venue:
  data Event = Event { -- more than this but tags :: [EventTag], venue :: Venue, } newtype EventTag = EventTag { tagName :: Text } newtype Venue = Venue { venueName :: Text } 
 In the database schema, however, I have tables for tags and venues, and a foreign key relation to the events table.
 I had been using hasql for my database interactions, but found it extremely painful, so I switched to persistent, for which I defined the following schema:
 ``` TagRow sql=tags name Text UniqueTagName name
 VenueRow sql=venues name Text UniqueVenueName name
 EventRow sql=events title Text description (Maybe Text) url URL venueId VenueRowId startDate UTCTime endDate UTCTime origination OriginationURI UniqueOriginationURI origination approvedAt UTCTime rejectedAt UTCTime
 EventTag sql=event_tags eventId EventRowId tagId TagRowId |] ```
 What I'm not sure how to do, is how to insert non-existent tags and venues, and then insert the events, using persistent, in a relatively efficient way. I had done this previously using hasql as can be seen here, which is quite ugly but did the trick.
 I can think of three approaches with persistent, one is to do something analogous to what I'm doing above: write the tags, collecting the ids and names in a mapping, do the same with the venues, then stitch all this together when inserting the events. This one I do not know how to do with persistent. The other would be to process the events one at a time, inserting the tags, then fetching them again, doing the same with the venue, and then inserting the event. This one I think I know how to do with persistent. The final one would be to write it all as raw sql and process it that way, which I'm really not fond of as an idea (and haven't looked into).
 Any pointers / help would be much appreciated.

(setq inhibit-startup-screen t) (setq hello-key (kbd "C-c C-j")) (global-foo-mode 1) 
 I have split the code above into 2 parts. The first part contains the code for the minor mode. The bottom three lines show how the user may use the mode.
 The user wants to set the hello-key to (kbd "C-c C-j") before enabling the mode. But the minor mode ignores this new value of hello-key because it has already used the old value (kbd "C-c C-f") while defining the keymap for the minor mode.
 Is it possible to create a minor mode in a way that every time the user enables the minor mode, the minor mode re-evaluates its keymap?

 Normally this is accomplished with the C-c RET key combination, but in this case the window in question is an EXWM window running under Xpra so it traps the key combination and handles it itself.
 The way around it is to get the window title of the Xpra window from Emacs/EXWM, derive the window-id from it or find it some other way then pass it to the ((exwm-workspace-move-window (frame-or-index &optional0 id)).
 So begins my excursion into finding Emacs window ids, the X window values and those of frames as well.
 Where do I start?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the pretest version has been released, I cloned and built Emacs 29 on OpenSUSE TW. I used the following options:
 --with-native-compilation=aot --with-x-toolkit=gtk3 --without-xaw3d --with-xinput2 --with-tree-sitter --with-json --without-compress-install CFLAGS='-march=native' 
 I faced an issue, so I searched and found the following comments on Arch AUR:
  
Native JSON support was removed from emacs sometime in the first semester of 2022. In my tests leaving JSON support out had some breaking bugs that made it a non-starter. I have to test it again before adding such switch to t build script.
  
I checked the official Arch package recipe and found that they do not use the --with-json option. The same is with OpenSUSE official package. However, Fedora package does use that option for their building. '
 Anyway, I found a tip that running make bootstrap could solve the issue, and it works. Emacs 29 got compiled successfully, and it now runs flawlessly on my machine since morning. Actually, I'm not sure what the issue was and if it was caused by --with-json option, but I wanted to raise a discussion about whether using this option is not recommended anymore by default.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does someone know how does the css-ls validate the css file? Emacs doesn't show any errors for my css file, but when I ran it through the w3 css validator I got an error.
 There is a variable lsp-css-validate which is set to t in emacs. So I assume it does some validation https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-css/#lsp-css-validate
 But maybe the LSP validation is not as strict as the W3 css validator? https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en
 Scenario where I ran into this was that I had written "scale (1)" instead of the correct "scale(1)". Spent quite a bit of time to hunt this down manually.
 In hindsight I would've spotted the error immediately if I had put the css file through the W3 CSS validator. Maybe next time I'll remember this.

 I'm working on a new project using effectful after having not touched effects in a while. I previously used polysemy and it was a pretty good experience.
 Pawel Szulc once again made a nice talk on using an effect system and it gave me a refresher and some other good information: Effectful | Paweł Szulc | Lambda Days 2022 .
 It's perfectly possible to just implement only the IO interpreter and test that while developing with effectful, and for a while I did just that.
 However things became more interesting once I wanted to start testing. So here are rambly thoughts I've had bouncing around that others might want to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many fonts now support this readability enhancement: to display zero with slashes. This is not a different character (such as a slashed o character: „ Ø ”), but a variation of how zeros are displayed. 
 (This can also be enabled in web browsers with JavaScript script extensions such as Stylus, Stylebot etc.). 
 I understand that some people may be not welcoming change (including this one), but this is important for many things, including programming. I kept trying to make chat-gpt understand what code I'm asking for but it never provides any useful answer, as my current font in Emacs already supports this feature, it is just Emacs which does not make the font display this useful differentiation (variation). 
 Please don't be harsh, for now I'd like to just improve some annoying things in the meanwhile of beginning to learn some more Emacs topics. Regards :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My level is pretty poor, but I've been told--and seen elsewhere--innumerable times that it's a good idea to start working on open source projects.
 I'm aware of one particularly friendly project called Bevy, which is a game engine written in Rust. They have "good-beginner" issues and are extremely nice in both the comments and in Discord, and are very active in helping newcomers. 
 I'd like to not jump into projects that aren't able to allocate resources to helping beginner programmers on trivial problems. It would be a huge waste of their time and I assume disrupting their workflow. 
 I'm mostly just wanting to find projects that mostly meet this criteria. Bonus points if there's an active discord/slack community. 
 Any sector is fine, since I'm trying to branch out and learn what I like. Pretty much any subject goes. I'm more interested in the coding experience/learning the ropes than anything. It'll take time to find out what subject I really like. Right now, I have so much fun coding that the project itself rarely matters.
 My only limitation is that my math background is very poor, so a lot of research-based projects are probably too difficult for me.
 Any info would be really welcome. 
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edits
  
Title should read org-bullets, not bullet-mode. Thank you /u/github-alphapapa.
  
Problem & background
  
New install of default emacs GUI (27.1) on a new EOS 7 install.
 
H4 level bullets are rendering differently to previous 27.1 GUI, they are too big.
 
Examples: Tidy H4 stars on old GUI. New, large flowers on current GUI.
 
 Information
  
Emacs version 27.1 for both. GTK+ Versions - Old: 3.22.30 New: 3.24.30
 
Same config file
 
Same font: "Roboto Mono:pixelsize=13:foundry=pyrs:weight=normal:slant=normal:width=normal:scalable=true"
 
Stars render in the 'old' way if emacs is launched in a terminal using "emacs -nw". 
 
 Desired resolution
  
Get the H4 bullets to render in the same way as the old GUI.
  
If anybody has encountered the following issue, or has ideas for how to fix it, the help would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm struggling to figure out why something isn't working on my end as it should be. And now I'm stuck trying to make sense of the definition of TeX-check-engine. 
 From what I can tell, this function will ask to check the engine only if (but not only if, since there's a few other conditions I'm not listing here) the value of TeX-check-engine-list is set to something other than its default value, presumably to the list of engines required by the file being visited. 
 So here is my question: what is supposed to set the value of that variable? Looking at the docstring, I see that it should depend on what engine is required by the "loaded TeX packages". But I don't see what determines what the loaded TeX packages are, nor how that list is supposed to be updated. 
 (I'm running into difficulties using emacs -Q after reinstalling auctex etc., so I don't see how this could be due to something in my config.)
 If anyone has any pointers, even if not a complete solution, I'd be curious to know what they are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Emacs 28.2. Here is my code:
 ;;; foo.el (define-minor-mode foo-mode "Foo mode" :lighter " Foo" (message "foo-mode %s in buffer %s" foo-mode (buffer-name))) (defun foo-mode-on () (foo-mode 1)) (define-globalized-minor-mode global-foo-mode foo-mode foo-mode-on) 
 This works like I want.
 emacs -q -l foo.el 
 Then I run these things:
 C-x b *scratch* M-x global-foo-mode C-x b foo C-x b bar C-x b baz 
 I find that all buffers foo, bar and baz have Foo mode enabled. But https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Defining-Minor-Modes.html has got this to tell
  
Globally enabling the mode also affects buffers subsequently created by visiting files, and buffers that use a major mode other than Fundamental mode; but it does not detect the creation of a new buffer in Fundamental mode.
  
But in my case, it did work for fundamental mode buffers too. Why did it work when the documentation says it should not have worked? Or the documentation does not say that and I am misunderstanding something?

 I am trying to correct a problem with a theme I am using. As you can see, the next character in the list of options is practically invisible.
 But I don't have any idea where to start looking. I know the file from which the theme is being loaded, and I can modify it. But there are sooo many definitions that I have no idea which one is the one being used.
 What would be the best way to identify the theme class used by this text?
 (by the way, this problem started with my last update to prelude, which I use. I am also using the leuven theme, which I load after prelude).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This has been an issue for a while, and I hope someone can tell me what's really going on. I use transient-mark-mode and normally it works great. But once in a while it gets "wedged", where the region doesn't deactivate properly after something that should deactivate it. As a concrete example, if I mark a region and hit delete, the region is removed, but not deactivated. So if I move the point, it expands the region again, leaving the mark where it was. And if I just start typing, I only get the last letter, as each letter replaces the previous. The only way I've found to fix this is to exit emacs and restart it.
 Ideally, I'd like to figure out what setting gets "bumped" that makes this happen, and prevent it. Failing that, a way to correct it short of not using TMM would be nice. In the worst case, knowing what triggers it so I can maybe avoid it would be better than where I am now.

I've put in some more advanced stuff as well which I thought was interesting but that you can safely ignore for now if you're actually just learning about functors.
 Most people on this subreddit are probably plenty familiar with functors already, but hopefully this can still help you think about functors or maybe help you help someone who is just learning about functors themself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! Some time ago I published my very first couple of packages, both of them related to note-taking. Having essentially used them for a rather long time, they have proven to be very useful to me and I wanted to share them with you.
 I did not want to write here when I published them, to try and fix any bugs or problems that would arise by their new bundled form, but they seem to be working properly so... here they are:
  
KLP is a general package, focusing solely on making the consistent naming as easy as possible, with a note_category_title.org, template. This allows for arbitrary categories to be easily defined, built and search through. Some use cases for it would be cheatsheet files, easily accessible notes on cli tools ... generally static notes.
 Org-lectures. Now this one, even though it shares quite a lot of elements with KLP (it was developed almost simultaneously) allows for the easy creation and management of courses and lectures files. By assigning a couple of keybindings and complementing it with a package like CDLatex or Yasnippets, a really fun workflow was created that allows me to take (in real time) lecture notes for my university courses.
  
Feel free to try them!
 P.S. My experience in writing packages is limited, so any feedback would be more than welcome (this is the reason why I decided to post here after all, :P). Literate programming files also exist in their respective repos, allowing for easier understanding of these simple packages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have searched online, but this is the best I could come up with, I'm not sure if it is correct, please correct these definitions.
  
seq :: a → b → b
 Evaluates first argument to weak head normal form (WHNF), when that is completed only then the second argument is returned (ensure arg1 is completed before proceeding with arg2).
 
pseq :: a → b → b
 
 Evaluates first argument to WHNF however does so in parallel using spark, when that is done the second argument is evaluated..
  
par :: a → b → b
  
Evaluates first and second arg in parallel, with hope that arg1 will be fully evaluated by the time its result is needed. It is useful in cases where the evaluation of first arg is expensive and is acceptable to delay its result until later.
 ​
 Now consider this quicksort algorithm:
 import Control.Parallel (par, pseq) 
 parSort (x:xs) = greater ‘par‘ (lesser ‘pseq‘ (lesser ++ x:greater)) 
 where lesser = parSort [y | y <- xs, y < x] 
 greater = parSort [y | y <- xs, y >= x] parSort _ = []
 It will be almost as (in)efficient as the sequential version:
 sort :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a] sort (x:xs) = lesser ++ x:greater
 where lesser = sort [y | y <- xs, y < x]
 greater = sort [y | y <- xs, y >= x] sort _ = []
 Why is that?

 I've recently updated my emacs to v29 --with-native-comp and I noticed that now when I do C-h f -> consult-grep for example I'm getting the doc for that function as expected but the link to the source code where the function is defined leads to my packages.el file where I use use-package to install consult. 
 I just checked and I have similar issue with projectile functions too.
 the message says:
 projectile-grep is an autoloaded interactive native-compiled Lisp function in ‘../../packages.el’
 There is no such issue with variables defined by projectile or consult. The issue is there for some packages and for some not. For example orderless functions have no such issue and the doc points to orderless.el as expected. php-mode is fine. Magit has the issue. 
 Have you noticed anything like that in your setup? Is it native-comp related? Is there any way to guide Emacs so it knows where definitions are? It seems like Emacs knows that let's say projectile-grep is there, it knows the docstring as well. But for some reason it just points to wrong file. 
 Just for some additional info: - I'm on MacOS - I use emacs-plus@29 compiled with brew - I use use-package with straight
 Any idea on how to solve it is highly appreciated. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My idea is simple: I want to use emacs as a cross platform window manager: I want to have the same setup for managing windows, regardless of the operating system I am using. One simple idea is to send the windows to emacs and let emacs manage windows, that way I can use the same config everywhere.
 For example, I want emacs to be able to resize photoshop or final cut pro.
 I haven't found anything on how to do that on Windows, Mac and ChromeOS.
 Does something already exist to do so?

But the same isn't true for text that I copy. So I have to kill then yank, which is a nuisance. I can rebind M-w but is there a workaround I'm not aware of? Fixes online seem to be about running X in windows but since killed text is transferred fine I don't know why that would be necessary...

I tried adding (setq python-shell-interpreter "/path/to/python3") to my init.el and setting my environment variables within Emacs and all of the other suggestions I found online, but still kept receiving the error. I even tried creating an alias for python in my .bashrc and calling emacs from the command line. 
 I finally solved the problem by creating a symlink to python: ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python Hopefully if someone else encounters this issue and searches for a solution, they find this post and it works for them as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a noticeable lag of at least 2 seconds when switching between Emacs frames.
 It only happens in combination of pdf-tools frames. I have the profiler report but I am not sure if it is orderless, vertico or some problem with completion. And the weird thing is that there is no pdf-tools reference at all. 
 Any ideas?
 Side question: Should I just drop pdf-tools from my packages? I have a love hate relationship with it, on one side it is very useful to have all of my pdf files in Emacs, but at the same time scrolling is not smooth and it has a lot of quirks like zoom reset when changing pages or getting stuck on a page. :/

 ​
 - I run a command (`display_run_stack` or something), and a new window opens with `run_stack` displayed in a special readonly buffer. Each entry of `run_stack` should be one line.
 - Each element of `run_stack` is a struct with a `uuid` field. When point is over a given entry, pressing Enter calls a function (`goto_uuid`) on that uuid.
 ​
 The thing I have in mind is something like Org Agenda. Any advice how to program this? Kind of a noob wrt emacs application programming. Not sure where to even start. Example code from some other project would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Long time lurker here but first time poster.
 I thought this community might be interested in my dissertation. It’s an evaluation of effect systems / design patterns in pure functional languages, from first principles. It operates at the intersection of the academic literature and real world software development. Haskell was the most obvious language for this task, so I used a small program involving four key effects: environment, state, errors and I/O.
 A lot of my time was spent trying to understand the history of the domain and drawing out the most important criteria for working programmers. In the end I settled on: expressiveness, modularity, extensibility, ergonomics and performance. These are the basis for the comparison.
 I don’t expect anyone to have the time to read the whole thing, so this post summarises some of the key take aways: https://www.dantb.dev/posts/dissertation
 I also compiled a list of my favourite resources (there should be a few familiar names from this subreddit… 🙂): https://www.dantb.dev/posts/effects-bibliography
 This evaluation may be useful for people wanting to understand the trade offs involved in selecting tools and techniques in pure functional languages. This was one of my personal goals for the project, as someone who has used pure FP in Scala for several years but never went deep on the theory before. I saw a bit of a gap in the literature regarding the application of these design patterns from the perspective of a software developer, which is what I’m most interested in.
 The structure is broadly chronological and a lot of it is probably old news for experienced Haskellers. With that in mind, I'd highlight Chapter 7 which contrasts extensible effects with the earlier approaches.
 Comments are open 🙂

 I had to sprinkle in some more lazy until it didn't produce stack overflows anymore.
  
Edit 1: When I write lazy val sum the forward reference error goes away and an infinite-loop warning appears. When I write that: => Parser[T2] instead of that: Parser[T2], that warning goes away as well. I'm going to report back and see if it works with an implementation!
 The problem is that I don't really know what I'm doing. I just understand that in Haskell, everything is lazy and in Java, everything is eager evaluation, besides stuff like &&, which I guess works "lazily" in Java as …]]></summary>

  (let ((default-font (pcase system-type ('gnu/linux "Liberation Mono 16") ('darwin "Avenir 16") ((or 'windows-nt 'cygwin) "Corbel 16") (_ "Verdana 16")))) (cond ((find-font (font-spec :name "Fira Code")) (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font .

"DejuVu Sans Mono 16"))) (t (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist `(font . ,default-font))) ) ) 
 However, instead, Liberation Mono is set to be the font for some reason. I thought that find-font would return a list if a font is found, which is truthy, but that doesn't appear to be the case. And yes, I'm sure that Fira Code is installed properly:
 (find-font (font-spec :name "Fira Code")) -> #<font-entity ftcrhb CTDB Fira\ Code nil iso10646-1 regular normal normal 0 nil 100 0 ((:font-entity "/usr/share/fonts/truetype/firacode/FiraCode-Regular.ttf" . 0) (:name . "Fira Code"))> 
 The output below the elisp snippet is what I get when I evaluate it.

 Is there a similar Emacs package to convert from text to professional-looking directed diagrams like decision trees?
 I searched Google, Reddit and Emacs SE and the best I encountered was:
  
graph.el - converts a difficult to parse elisp lists to a similarly difficult to read text diagram.
 a bunch of packages for converting org docs to diagrams of various sorts, none of which were quite suitable for making arbitrary directed diagrams.
  
My hope is my google-fu has failed me and there is a great package I've missed. Also open to non-Emacs suggestions that could be integrated into Emacs with some work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[static-ls is a low memory language server for Haskell that serves as an alternative to hls with less functionality by using statically generated information. It is intended for (Highly recommend hls instead if you aren't having these issues):
  
enterprise sized projects that are either too large or make extensive use of template Haskell leading to high memory usage for hls
 for machines with too little memory where hls can end up using too much memory
  
and provides a small subset of haskell language server's functionality namely:
  
Type on hover
 Find references
 Go-to definition
  
Future features I'd like to implement include: - Haddock documentation on hover from interface files - Diagnostics from ghcid - Autocomplete in scope from hiedb
 It has been tested it on a codebase with over 180,000 LOC and works relatively stably. With a combination of ghcid, an hiedb filewatcher and the -fdefer-type-errors flag you can get pretty solid IDE behavior. Currently only ghc 9.4.4 is supported but happy to personally help people set this up if interested!
 Any feedback is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce the 0.4.0.0 release of generic-persistence! Here is the Hackage Link.
 generic-persistence is a Haskell persistence layer for relational databases. The approach relies on GHC.Generics. The actual database access is provided by the HDBC library.
 New things in this release:
  
A query DSL
 Connection pooling
 A fail safe API that uses Either to safely return all database runtime errors
  
changes:
  
all retrieve* functions have been renamed to select*
 the function retrieveAll was removed. Selection of all entries os a table can now be done with select conn allEntries
  
All new features and changes are documented in the tutorial.
 I've also created a sample project that demonstrates how to build a Servant REST service using generic-persistence for database access.
 All Feedback, bug reports and pull requests are welcome!

 I wonder how the objects are represented so that rules can allow or filter an event.
 I wanted to learn Haskell and give this problem a try; I am thinking in terms of identifying sensitive information in logs. For example, let's say we are looking for AWS Access keys, i.e. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

this is a new idea of mine that I don't understand well yet:
The value of a position in chess consists of its probability of victory for the player. Moves are evaluated according to how they affect this probability of victory.
We can apply this to our thinking: knowledge-based value creation consists of enriching data, information, and pre-existing knowledge with value-giving properties. Value-giving properties include: Accuracy/Completeness, Reliability, and Usefulness.
An evaluation of thinking would look like this:1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm kind of a newbie on configuring emacs, so here is the context:
 I decided to install cmake-ide. It seems that rtags came along with the former. Fine, but I also decided to use the vertico package. It also seems that rtags has a support for Helm, but from what I understand, Helm and and Vertico fall under the same category of packages and therefore I can only have one of them.
 I found this friendly tutorial on how to install cmake-ide and I'm pretty satisfied with the customization used in it. I thought that by omit the helm line in the config scope and by changing (setq rtags-display-result-backend 'helm) to vertico would workout with my configuration, but it failed.
 So my question is: is it possible to combine vertico and rtags to work simultaneously?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The reason I say viable is that it's always of course possible. Knowing people can always land you a job and so can incredible luck.
 Often times with niche languages, it's easy to get a job despite the total amount of jobs being limited. If no one is applying, the competition is pretty weak or nonexistent. 
 I've seen that many jobs in Haskell are in the healthcare sector. It seems to be pretty standard enterprise stuff that likely was done with Java at some point in the past. 
 Are these jobs, or Haskell jobs (non-research) in general competitive?
 If you were rating the difficulty of getting a job in Haskell as a self-taught programmer on a scale of 1-10 (with 1 being a webdev at a no-name website and 10 being a FAANG job), where would you put Haskell jobs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want specific buffers (in my case Clojure REPL related) always appear on the right side which can be done by adding a set of values to display-buffer-alist:
 (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist `(,(rx bos (or "*cider-repl" "*nrepl-server" "*cider-test-report*" "*cider-error" "*cider-result")) (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-direction) (direction . right) (window . root) (dedicated . nil) ;; (window-preserve-size . (t . t)) ;; (window-width . 0.30) )) 
 Now, you can see that I have a couple of things commented because they don't appear to work. it looks like I'm not using the right combination of display-buffer functions. Or maybe something else is wrong.
 What I want is:
  
I want buffers to appear initially on the right side with specific width (0.30 of the frame)
 If I change the position of the window, e.g., move it to the left side, I want Emacs to remember my choice, and when I bury the buffer and pop to it again, I want it to come from the left. Currently, it always pops on the right side
 The same for the width. If I change the width - I want Emacs to preserve it and the next time I pop the buffer, it should not resize the window.
  
Can someone help me tame display-buffer so it works as I want? Thank you!

Statically-typed
 Generates self-contained binaries
 Not Go
 Has a garbage collector
 Not lazy nor extremely aggressive about immutability
 Packaged in most common distros, such as Debian or RHEL
 Good ecosystem for writing CLI tools (nice argument parsers, good support for running other programs)
  
But the on-topic requirement is that it has a great experience in Emacs. As a statically typed language, table stakes is good completion. Also it should not lag Emacs. Not requiring too much fiddling would be nice.
 I think nothing checks all boxes, so I'm just looking to tick most..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use the standalone ranger file manager on my system outside of Emacs and I'm used to the various commands and keybindings. I've been using ranger.el for a while to replicate this experience, but unfortunately I keep hitting a bug regarding bookmarks, which I think is related to the enhanced bookmark-plus/bmkp package I use to manage bookmarks. It also seems to get stuck after a while, with multiple copies of the same tab/pane opening if I keep hitting q to close ranger. Additionally ranger.el doesn't look like it's being actively maintained at the moment, 
  
 I've tried using dirvish, which has the added benefit of being recently updated. The previews seem to work nice, but (I realize this sounds crazy) there seems to be too much going on feature-wise. I keep trying to have the ranger like view with three panels, but dirvish seems to switch to a more standard dired like view despite my config. On top of this, there isn't a nice C-h to hide dotfiles and I occasionally get a Selected deleted buffer error if I want to look at a directory I've killed.
  
 Does anyone have a smooth ranger.el or dirvish setup to share, or ways of overcoming the problems I mentioned above? Or a different way to browse files that's more robust?

 then, just blow my mind that

 I used to read functor /applicative/monad ref a lot , coud you guys comment my understanding is right on `Functor`
 fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b 
 fmap is just a funciton that :
  
describe how to extract `a` from the container `f-1`
 then run function (a -> b), to get `b`
 then describe how to plug back `b` to container `f-2` ( f-2 doesn't have to be same with f-1)
  
The key is : on different types, the effect of fmap is describling how to extract parameter and how plug back the result to a container (maybe a new container with some state change as well ) ?

 Swift (SourceKit-LSP Doesn't support Code-lenses, so if you have support for that for your language you're better off keeping you current solution)
 Enjoy!

 I’m a new student to programming and I have exams in a little over a month’s time but since I’m more of a science student most of the concepts aren’t linking as easily to me as compared to the rest of the students. Is there any advice or anything I could do to improve within the next month so I can pass this course? I also do understand the answers when I’m doing questions but it’s just writing and coming up with the functions that is the hard part. 
 Thank you in advance!

 I work frequently with a (proprietary) application that uses the .Net standard serialiser. I often manually edit these files, as they also contain a DSL embedded in some of the content, that I find easier to tweak this way rather than via the application itself.
 I was considering developing a small prog mode to assist me with some or all of the following features:
  
hide most of the XML boilerplate (but retain the structure)
 display the DSL code, ideally with syntax highlighting. This code is embedded within two XML elements.
 where multiple code elements exist in an XML file, provide some mechanism to display this in a natural way
  
I'd be amazed if something similar hadn't been done previously, so I'm looking for an example or two that will provide me with a flavour of what is possible.
 Thanks

 Why is agenda not editable?
 Around a third of my workflow is going through filtered notes in a table and adding various things. This is very dynamic - I might want to suddenly have another column in the table (or remove it, or resize it), to add more information, or to not have something clutter the view.
 So far, it seems the agenda is very "set in stone", and I am going to be unable to do things on-the-fly. Only possible to spend time preparing a view, then use and re-use it.
 Is orgmode really this unflexible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I am using org-mode and org-attach via doom emacs. Whenever I have made notes and tried to attach something using either org-download-screenshot or org-download-clipboard, by default the heading has an "ATTACH" tag signifying that there is an attachment in this heading. Example shown below.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/dcx9pfdb9esa1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b453b1d160882ee09624e84c5598ec222c5f3ec
 Now when I try to export this to GFM using pandoc, this is what it does
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/2keyfcri9esa1.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=57aa82093888ea635644fcedc5be3eaf376f21f4
 Essentially it exports the ATTACH tag out. I have a couple of questions.
  
What's the purpose behind the "ATTACH" tag? The reason I ask this is because I can easily set org-attach-auto-tag to nil and this tag is not attached and therefore not exported. But does it have other consequences that I might not be aware of. Reading the documentation, it doesn't appear so, but I am then left to wonder why this would be the default behavior.
 Is there a way to keep the org-attach-auto-tag to the default value of "ATTACH" but not have it exported. I tried setting the EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS to ATTACH but then of course the whole content doesn't get exported.
  
Thanks for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking for a workflow where I'd paste images from clipboard all the time. I figured I could do it with the org-download package like so (with use-package):
 (use-package org-download :ensure t ;; this makes sure the thing is loaded if not present :init (setq org-download-method 'attach) :config (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'org-download-enable) :bind ("C-y" . org-download-clipboard)) 
 Which works, until I try to paste text. Emacs freezes completely, and is unusable.
 I realized this also happens if I just call org-download-clipboard directly without a shortcut, when there is no pic in the immediate clipboard.
 So my question is: am I doing something wrong? Is there a simple solution here without having to use different shortcuts?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I usually don't post on Reddit, so I apologize in advance if I make some obvious mistakes. I've already asked similar question here on a different subreddit, but I was wondering if there are better solutions.
 ​
 I previously owned a Mac Book 2020 and used Emacs for editing texts. I really liked that the OS X had a global/system wide shortcut that allowed cursor move/act like in Emacs (e.g. C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p C-a, C-e, C-k). For example, I could use the Emacs move for browsers (Chrome/Firefox), File Manager, etc.
 However, I recently had to return my Mac, and purchased a Steam Deck which has a Arch Linux like OS called SteamOS, which does not have the Emacs movements enabled globally/system wide.
 I tried to configure cursor movements/actions similar to the Emacs moves via KDE Custom Shorcut (details of how I configured can be seen here), but this solution does conflict with several applications, and I have a feeling that there might be a better solution.
 By any chance, does anyone know how to configure non-Mac OS (in my case SteamOS/Arch Linux) to have shortcuts similar to the Emacs in a global/system wide manner?

My week has been busy with medical issues that prevented me from making many new notes. I feel good now. 
I got my first two essays back from the professor in my food writing class, and I feel good about them. I am of a different generation than everyone else in the class, including the instructor. There are a couple of writers in the class that seem to be able to write a first draft of a 'writing prompt exercise' that is far more polished than my 'shitty first drafts'. They are modeling a skill that I aspire to.
While journaling this morning, I found a gem in an entry from one year ago today. It's very meta, and this is all very circular.

  
Zettelkasting and journaling are like workouts. You have a busy day ahead. Why journal? Journaling is not just another task. At first, you stumble with form.  Like when you are a beginner at weight training, you struggle with repeatedly getting to the gym. You think it will help your physical health, but at first, you feel sore, tight, and tired, not at all the pinnacle of health. Eventually, if you stick with it, you might find a coach that helps with form, you might set up your environment so going to the gym feels natural, you might start to feel strength building, and you've started progressing on the climb to physical health.
All these weight training actions can be applied to zettelkasting and journaling. They train your mental health in the same way exercise trains your physical health. It's a slow process at first. You can't see the improvements day to day or even week to week. Improvement only comes with consistency.


I think I'll move this gem from my journal to my ZK. I have a couple of relevant notes on the mental health benefits of journaling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'd like to support a couple of Emacs maintainers but I'm not sure to whom and how much.
 For example I can choose the maintainers of my favourite packages and transfer some money on a regular basis. Is it okay to support many maintainers with less money or should I support few maintainers with more money? Or should I support FSF in general?
 I'm thinking of $50 per month. So, should I give 10 maintainers $5 per month or 5 maintainers $10?
 I will find an answer for myself but I'm interesting of how do you handle it.
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Emacs 28 with tree-sitter.el. I'm trying to extract import-statements from C sources, and fail miserably.
 I can see the node tree using tree-sitter-debug-mode. But when playing around with queries - either interactively with tree-sitter-query-builder or with code (see below) - I don't get any results.
 My code looks like this, and runs:
  (tsc-query-matches (tsc-make-query tree-sitter-require 'c) [(preproc_include)]) (tsc-root-node tree-sitter-tree) #'ts--buffer-substring-no-properties) 
 The result is  [(0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . [])] 
 Which makes sense given the actual 6 include statements I have in the source file. But apparently no actual contents are extracted. Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey.
 I'm just getting started with emacs, and I can't even really start because of errors. Please help me stay here.
 I tried the debian package. It is bugged to say the least, and I found out quite quickly (see https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cdei4p/failed_to_download_gnu_archive_bad_request/)I decided to install a newer version, as described by emacswiki (ganneff.de)https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsSnapshotAndDebian
 ​
 When apt was installing it, it would throw a much of eager-macro-expansion failure lines, something like
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 5) 
 When running it, everything seemed fine, but, when I open a .org file, it throws
 (New file) File mode specification error: (error Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)) 
 It does not do this if I run it with emacs -Q.
 Someone with a similar issue was https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/74421/eager-macro-expansion-failure-message-when-starting-emacs-28-2-from-the-mac-te , however, there is no fix there that worked for me
 HOME=/tmp emacs 
 ^^ This still produces the error, even with an empty tmp.
 sudo apt remove --autoremove emacs emacs-common emacs-gtk 
 ^^ I did run this before installing the new one.
 Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you.
 ​
 EDIT: I tried deleting everything again, and installed the snap package. Same issue. There must be something leftover I'm guessing from those past emacs.
