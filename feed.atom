 it looks like the internet doesn't work, but I asked people in different countries to try, and get the same result. 
 after I added the 'Port 993', I get error 
 IMAP error: unexpected EOF from imap.gmail.com (172.253.122.109:993) 
 I'd like to know if anyone is still able to use mbsync with gmail? is anything wrong, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it possible to modify Orgzly with Lisp? I want to add more functionality to Orgzly.
 Eg:
 (I) Repeat a task on every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday without having to add repeaters and then mark as complete every time I want the task to move forward (similar to how Google calendar or tasks.org can do it)
 (II) Configure in such a way that anything marked with specific tags (or a cluster of tags) should appear on a specific day/s of the week, such as all the tasks tagged with 'backup', 'upkeep', 'repairs' and 'meta', appearing on Sunday
 (III) Add dates that denote 'from' and 'to' dates, and configure so that they appear that way on the agenda/schedule
 etc.
 If Orgzly does not support that, is there any other way I can do it? Another app maybe?
 Also, I am not super tech-savvy. I can read a documentation and understand stuff. I have done basic programming, but nothing with near-low-level type languages. As of right now, I know nothing about Lisp. So Orgmode enthusiasts, would you say that this is feasible.

 I tried to get this into Melpa, but was rejected because it's a smart-compile fork. I have extended its functionality so much it may as well its own project.
 I've been using this for many years, with enhancements along the way, like it,for example, being able to find the root of your github project to run compiles from there.
 You will need to manually install this, but that should be no effort for most Emacs users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of Will's ZK focuses on self-improvement ideas. Is self-improvement a bad thing?  I don't think so. He needs a lot of improvement. They are reminders. Once he hears or reads an idea, it seems so naturally intuitive. He thinks, "I've heard that before." He's unsure if capturing the idea in a note or writing it into the world makes a difference.
As soon as Will makes such a declaration, Will finds a truckload of notes that don't exactly fit the self-improvement line of ideas. Notes on ideas from Python, materials engineering, atmospheric science, architecture, self-driving cars, dog training, uji, vision, and many others. These others only make up a fraction of Will's ZK.
Will is hunting for interesting things to take notes on that are not philosophically based on self-improvement.
This evolving process is happening from the bottom up. He is finding it to be quite enjoyable and is training his mind, enjoying the journey rather than just the end result.
Is Will off base? Is this a thing? How do you view the mix of the content of your zettels?
He presently processed a self-help article 1 that pointed out three "hobbies worth pursuing."

 I made Horn, an org parsen written in typescript.
 I needed a js org parser for one of my PWA related project and I wasn't happy with the ones I found (couldn't parse large files, failed to understand /bold italic/, written in an alien-to-my-eyes js...). 
 I decided to build it myself; it is right now available on npm and github. It can parse 10mB files within 1-2 seconds, and it has a good support of org features.
 You can reach me here if you have some suggestion. I hope it may be useful to the community !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello friends,
 I recently tried installing kde-plasma-desktop with sddm on an Ubuntu 22.04 installation with GNOME. I didn't try it in a vm first and thought I could just get away with having both on my machine with no problems. Stupid, I know. I ended up removing KDE and reinstalling gdm, but now I'm missing all of my GTK icons when I start up Emacs.

 The strange part is, that only sometimes the usual GTK icons will show up, and it's always when I least expect it. I suspect that some of the config changes that happened when I installed KDE conflicted with my GTK and my QT themes.
 I've tried removing gtk3.0 and gtk4.0 folders from my ~/.config directory, removing ~/.local/share/icons, and inspecting ~/.themes, but I see nothing related to icons there. I'm just wondering what could be causing this behavior, and if it's conflicting with other applications on my system I haven't discovered yet. GNOME tweaks says I'm using Yaru-magenta-dark, which appears to be working everywhere except for Emacs.
 Interested what people's thoughts are on this. I don't care much for the icons in the first place, but I thought this behavior was strange. Thank you

They both try to auto-detect the root folder for a project, depending on if there's some specific files present, or if the folder contains a git repository.
 I don't like this. Why does it work like that? What I want about these packages is to let me define what folder is a project, explicitely. I want to tell them, "hey, this folder is a project", even if its empty, and I never want them to automatically add any project.
 Is this possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, im new to the emacs space and am looking to dig deeper into modding emacs.
 I'm a web developer working a lot with typescript in the frontend and backend.
 I started off with some basic packages like projectile, LSP, magit and evil. However I'm getting kind of annoyed using evil mode, because i have to consider stuff like deactivating certain keys wenn i'm in another buffer (e.g xref buffer) or undos that dont work out of the box properly.
 Furthermore I would also like start learning more elisp, for which reason I'm doubting if i should even use vim bindings, because paredit seems to be a thing that i cant get working with vim bindings.
 However I also dont want to leave my vim skills behind and would rather prefer a professional emacs config that is tailored around evil, if thats possible.
 Can someone recommend a lightweight emacs config repository for ergonomic evil usage? Something thats really small and easy to understand and extend (So no spacemacs or doom).
 ​
 Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Seeing this post explain how to install and use Emacs on Android (native build), I wanted to share a tip on how to have a unified init.el file which can be synced across both Android and Linux so you don't have to change anything manually.
 Here is an example for my org notes:
 ;; Setting the base directory for org files (setq org-directory (cond ((eq system-type 'gnu/linux) "~/Notes") ((eq system-type 'android) "/storage/emulated/0/Notes") (t "~/Notes"))) 
 Essentially, for each part of the init.el file which is different based on the system it runs on, you can detect the appropriate system and do a different configuration.
 This will resolve any of your Android specific changes you need to implement, like I have with my org notes location in the presented example.
 With this, you can have the same init.el file and simply sync it across your systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pleased to announce a new release of stan, a static analysis tool for Haskell. stan now supports GHCs in the range 8.8-9.4[1].
 About stan
 Stan is a command-line tool for analysing Haskell projects. It discovers which parts of the code can potentially be improved, and offers suggestions on how to do so. Read more about stan in its README.
 Installation
 I recommend obtaining stan from Hackage by following the installation instructions in the README.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stan-0.1.0.0
 Help wanted
 stan lacks active maintainers and is currently in essential maintainance only mode. I am helping out to make sure stan can continue to build with newer GHCs. I would welcome assistance, particularly on the following issues:
  
Supporting GHC 9.6
 Supporting GHC 9.8
 Prospective support for GHC 9.10
 Fixing caching on Github Actions
  
If you would like to contribute to Stan please create an issue on the Github repository.
 Credits
 Thanks to the Kowainik team for creating stan in the first place. Thanks to Veronika Romashkina for accepting me as a new maintainer for the project.
  
[1] Some point releases are excluded because the GHC API doesn't seem to provide enough type information, notably the later releases in the 9.2 series.

 Yes, I can rebuild from source and enable it, but presumably the emacs devs disabled it by default for a reason. Furthermore, I'm finding that multiple sources that I might get a prepackaged Emacs from have this feature disabled. Rebuilding from source feels like I'm punching open a hole someone intentionally closed.
 Is there a workaround for what I'm trying to do? The best I can come with (other than rebuilding Emacs from source) is to use an external program to resize my image to the size I want it to be. That's fairly cumbersome, and it will clutter my directory with various image sizes as I experiment and figure out what i want. Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having a very strange bug when using emacs remotely. Currently my .emacs file is commented out except the lines defining the theme:
 When i start editing a file, i experience a severe display bug that prevents me from reading an edited line until i quit and reload the file, It is difficult to explain, but i've attached a screenshot of a line of text before and after typing the string "bannana bannana bannana bannana" at the start of the line (and pressing no other keys). I can start emacs with the -q flag to avoid this error, but I would prefer not to as I very much like having the theme set. I've also tried enabling a theme after starting with -q (in case there is a typo in my emacs file), and I get the same errant behavior.
 Has anyone here encountered a bug like this before?

 WOndering if anyone has a workflow that gets you from org-mode text to Google Slides quickly and painlessly? I am not talking about anything fancy, and I'm also not talking about org-reveal or org-re-reveal -- just somehow getting to the point of having one slide per headline, with text. And I can apply templates and formats & add pictures after I have a draft up. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm interested to know what the future of remove development with emacs might look like. I'm a long time emacs user, and use rust, lsp-mode, magit and projectile heavily. The remote experience with tramp just isn't very good. I've had to work around several bugs that lead to hangs, and even though I'm only ~20millis away from my remote machine performance is pretty bad. I believe I've already done everything I can to make it fast (ssh control master, etc.), and I'm still not happy. On the other hand, VSCode (which I'm not familiar with) or IntelliJ make remote development a breeze. I really like how they hide latency, and handle reconnects well. I've also tried terminal emacs on the remote machine, but I just can't deal with the input lag.
 It's remarkable how emacs has been able to adapt over the years, and so I'm interested to hear about some ideas to keep emacs relevant for this usecase.

This year after a similar situation I am being rejected by 9/10 applications off the rip and those I have gotten an interview with have either ghosted or rejected and my previous recruiters have nothing in their pipelines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! Seaman Emacs is my attempt at a literate, modular (module-layer), extensible Emacs configuration.
 Seaman makes it easy to add new packages or combinations of packages to your config and safely test them out, as well as phasing out unused packages and remove bloat from your config. Lastly, all source code is easily navigable and documented, with a single .org file in charge of running the show.
 If you use Emacs 29 it's super easy to try it out with --init-directory !
 I'd appreciate any feedback/suggestions/contributions a lot :)
 https://github.com/alopezrivera/Seaman-Emacs/
 Design choices:
  
Source: seaman.org contains is the source of all modules and layers. All source files are asynchronously tangled when saving. config.org contains the source code of your (in this case my) config. All blocks inside are asynchronously tangled to init.el when saving
 Package manager: straight.el
 Key bindings: Emacs + custom
  
Out of the box:
  
Clean UI
 Homescreen
 Easy theme switching (light/dark)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting interested in learning Haskell, and I'm trying to find a good first project to really sink my teeth into. Like the title says, I'm mainly targeting scientific applications -- nothing fancy right now, mostly just diagonalizing some matrices and numerical integration -- and I'm looking for some good libraries to use.
 I've already done a bit of searching on Hackage, but I'm mainly interested here in what people would recommend for N-dimensional arrays and matrix diagonalization. What's the general feeling on HMatrix?
 I guess I should also mention that I'm coming from a Python+Rust background, where my workflow was to do all the heavy lifting in Rust, serialize the data to a npy/npz file, and then do all the plotting in Python with matplotlib. One thing I haven't found on Hackage is something to handle the serialization step -- ideally, I'd like to take an HMatrix object (or some other equivalent) and just call a function to write it to a file. Does anyone know of a good solution for that? Otherwise, what are some nice, ergonomic (preferably matplotlib-like) plotting libraries?
 Thanks in advance!

 I have two projects in mind. One is to build a user friendly app on the web for general budgeting, and for more advanced cases; financial modelling and business use. This is a product idea, but my heart is really in number theory and various applied areas of mathematics. So second idea is to build a function library for a similar calculator catering to that. I know there’s good stuff out there but partly it is to develop my skills and understanding. 
 Is Haskell suitable for this? Would it be unwise to try hit two birds at once and just have a common library? Or should I keep the product idea seperate and use a more commonly understood language like python? Much thanks in advance!

In this blog post,
we will learn how to include Bayesian machine learning in a reactive rhine application.
Imagine a program that reacts in real time to a sensor input:
It might be a robot, an app using GPS data on a phone,
or a device to track an object’s location.
Also assume that we have some prior knowledge about how this data is produced,
so it makes sense to express this knowledge as a Bayesian model,
and use Bayesian machine learning to infer the best estimate of the state of the robot, phone, or object.
Then our program should be able to react continuously in real time to this estimate.

While I'm aware of various existing packages like roam, zk, and org-journal, I wanted a solution that precisely catered to my needs, without unnecessary features or the loss of essential ones. This drove me back to Emacs from Logseq, as I realized I only required a simple system for taking daily notes.
 With that in mind, I crafted a configuration to facilitate note-taking and accomplished a feature I had long desired: integration with Raindrop to fetch my bookmarks. Surprisingly, it was a straightforward process.
 This experience has reaffirmed my belief in the versatility of Emacs, allowing it to be tailored to meet one's unique requirements. I'm now fully immersed in the world of Emacs.
 Feel free to take a look at my configuration and offer any tips, code suggestions, or ideas on how to further enhance, simplify, or expand it. You can find the configuration here:

 `elgot-reconnect` fixes it, but it's really not a solution to call `eglot-reconnect` every 10 minutes.

Ideally, I'd just like the column to ALWAYS be present even if there are no changes. I tried modifying multiple variables, but I believe all the fringe ones are for graphical.

 Update: git-gutter:hide-gutter is already set to nil and it doesn't seem to preserve that column.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to all, As some of you probably did, i jumped on the treesitter train with emacs 29.1.
 I replaced my major modes by their ts counterparts, and gave it a try. For the keywords colors, it was mostly fine, and at first I only checked that and was content with it. 
 Things went a bit sour when I starting writing code, in particular the indent-rules. I have used mainly the following so far : - cmake-ts-mode - c++-ts-mode - yaml-ts-mode
 Over the past two weeks there has not been a work day where I did not have to complete or "fix" indentation rules to my liking.
 On the one hand it is much easier than before to tweak things, where either there was a customizable variable, either you were screwed. Now you can add rich rules, kind of easily
 On the other hand, the out of the box experience was much worse, barely usable indentation especially for the c++ mode which, despites its 4 presets, lacks the many quick toggles from cc-mode. 
 I do commend maintainers though for their amazing core implementation, the api + utilities make debugging tree sitter rules a breeze. 
 How has your treesitter Journey been so far ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! 
 I am looking for a working example of an import of a package from Github Packages Maven repository using scala-cli. 
 My use case would be to import libs shared internally in my company org. And if I get it working for private packages, then it should work for public ones too ! 
 Currently I have :
 scala-cli config --dump
 ```json
 { "repositories": { "credentials": [{"host":"https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG","user":"value:PrivateToken","password":"env:GITHUB_TOKEN","matchHost":true}]
 } }
 ```
 and the following using directives 
 ``` //> using repository "https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG" //> using lib "my.org::my-lib:0.1.0"
 ```
 which yields an unauthorized error on import.
 I also tried setting the repositories.credential.host to maven.pkg.github.com and maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG without success. 
 As for the repository in the using directive I have also tried ( not sure if I tried every combination of both ): - https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG/_ - https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG/REPO_OF_MY_LIB
 I am sure the token works. The unauthorized error seem to indicate either the crednetials are not passed or I am targeting the wrong URLs. Any idea on what's wrong with my setup ?

 So current work flow is compile switch to terminal run binary, switch back make changes compile return to terminal Ctrl + C to kill then run again, be nice if I could do all this from inside emacs.
 I guess a bash script could be an option but curious if others have this work flow and how it works ?
 Currently in a golang workflow but even better if there is a generic solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slipped in between paragraphs about being worried that her family's hiding place will be discovered by a new building owner and the fairness of rationing butter, Anne Frank mentions being gifted a zettelkasten to track her reading:

  
Father emptied a card file for Margot and me and filled it with index cards that are blank on one side. This is to become our reading file, in which Margot and I are supposed to note down the books we’ve read, the author and the date.


Niklas Luhmann (December 8, 1927-1998), famous for his own 90,000+ slip reading file, was a year and a half older than Anne Frank (June 12, 1929-1945) who received her first card index file in February 1943 (likely between the 27th, the date of her diary entry mentioning it and the prior diary entry on February 5th). It was given to her by her father at the age of 13. As would have been commonplace, she was intended to use it as a "reading file" to note down the books she'd read along with the author and the date.
One can only wonder at how many entries she would have made over the span of her life had it not come to such an abrupt end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It would be really nice to have everything in org mode, but I continually find myself coming back to planning with paper for all but the toy cases.
 It would be really nice, as a Computer Person, to have all of my notes and project management in a computer system. For instance, I have to manage my work sprints using Linear. But I find that org mode, and to some extent emacs, has too much friction for my liking.
 In the first place, it is not trivial to use with a mobile phone. Right now I have an emacs instance running inside termux, and notes have to be ported over with Syncthing. This necessitates (at least ideally) running a spare machine 24/7 to sync with. Not to mention that using my smartphone probably increases my risk of cancer at least slightly.
 If I have to write something down, I'm reluctant to open a new emacs window, navigate to my buffer, and then write down the point.
 Also, the default org-agenda views are much inferior to the typical calendar or timetable.
 Sorry for the emotional nature of this post. I'd be interested to hear if anybody was in a similar place, and where they ended up going.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some context: I'm a Java programmer, but I don't like it. I have a background in mathematics so naturally I am interested in (pure) functional programming. At my dayjob, I have expressed my feelings towards Java and expressed I would like to do something more "mathematically motivated" and coined Scala and their effect systems as examples. My teamlead, who himself is a developer, wanted me to give him a bit more of an explanation of what I meant by this, so I set out to gather some information I can present to him.
 But
 I am confused as to how I can unite the following two descriptions of effects:
  
Rob Norris in his talk 'Functional Programming with Effects' talks about mathematical functions and then talks about effects as basically ways to be able to do the stuff we're used to in programming like functions not being total, mutability, ... He then talks about the 6 most known 'effects' and wants to be able to compose them, then concludes that basically an effect is an `F[_]` which is a Monad.
 Cats-Effect, from the docs says that their typeclass hierarchy describe, fundamentally, what it means to be a functional effect. But their typeclass hierarchy is for their specific runtime and focusses almost exclusively on asynchrony, parallelism and concurrency. I don't see `Option` or `Either` fitting in here.
  
So what gives? I am really confused at this point, but I would really appreciate if someone could shed some light on this. 
 Bonus question: In the same talk, Rob Norris says that there are a lot of other effects out there. How do I find them? This sounds silly, but does he just mean like "custom monads" that we might define in our business which are only applicable in our custom business environment, or does he mean more powerful abstractions which are just more complex than the ones he showed?

 #+results: #+begin_example hello world #+end_example

 This beginner-friendly post demonstrates many simple Haskell functions, especially for working with lists. It also shows how to build and execute stateful computations using State
 from mtl. I (mostly) avoid type signatures and just focus on defining the terms, but there are plenty of links to API documentation. At the end of the post I suggest some enhancements to the model that would be good exercises for learners (and might be fun even for more experienced Haskell programmers).

 What kind of setting do you think would be useful for a lot (or a majority) of Emacs-users?
 One of my examples:
 (fido-vertical-mode t)
 Because seeing a list of candidates as you type and being able to choose from it with meaningful key-bindings is way more convenient and efficient than the tab-completion-system (I think this claim is backed by the way all those external packages work; helm, ivy, vertico). This is especially suited for a default because you can still use the tab-completion-system with it. So nobody needs to change habits.

 I get this message:-
 ​
  
"transient-setup: Suffix magit-branch.<branch>.merge/remote is not defined or autoloaded as a command"
  
Hopefully someone here has recently done the slog and can save this lazy individual some time. What changed? I havent touched my magit setup for literally years.
 (magit-checkout from minibuffer works fine).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I periodically run an emacs batch command using (org-store-agenda-views) to generate plain text and html versions of my org-agenda. This process works fine generally.
 However, some of my TODO headlines contain org-formatted links (i.e. within the headline). In both the .txt and .html generated files, these links appear with the full text of the org link - i.e. with [[link destination][link title]] visible in the generated/viewed file - rather than just 'link title'.
 Is this expected behaviour? Are there any settings that affect this behaviour? I would prefer not to see the full org link source in the generated files.
 (I'm currently running org version 9.6.10 and emacs 29.1 on Linux. When I first started generating these agenda files, the links in headlines exported correctly. I suspect that the current behaviour began after an org version upgrade, but I cannot remember which one, and have just been living with it since.)

 I realize now this is a quoting mechanism to prevent confusion inside an org document, and that this should not be removed. Instead is there a good way to font lock these commas so that they are barely visible?

 IntelliJ's Scala plugin really doesn't work too well. I really like IntelliJ's IDEA, but it's substantially harder to debug Scala 3 in my experience.
 I'm aware there are LSP servers for IntelliJ. How outlandish would it be use Metals in IntelliJ?
 (I'm asking out of curiosity, even if I could, I'm more of a VSCode user)

 In deadgrep, the same glob filter, !gtest*cpp returns NO results. If I remove the exclude, !, I ONLY get gtest*cpp results.
 Does deadgrep handle excluding glob patterns differently?

 I have Msys64 installed, fzf works in my terminal. I also have bash.exe working fine.
 In emacs, I have modified these variables in order to have bash.exe called instead of /bin/sh
  
sh-shell is set to bash
 sh-shell-file is set to the path to bash.exe
  
I have also search for mentions of /bin/sh using deadgrep... nothing useful. I do not know what to do.
 please help me fix this problem. thx

 I am a big user of GMail's "Scheduled Send" feature. It allows me to reply at my pace and make sure the thread does not become a ping-pong match and replies won't come back earlier than expected.
 How to do that "on my own"? I use notmuch + msmtp (within emacs) to handle most of my email but like half of it I have to manage via Gmail's web interface because of the scheduling needs.
 I know about msmtp-queue but it is a all or nothing solution. I would love to be able to schedule my emails, either at Emacs level or SMTP level, with some header or something.
 Any ideas?

Ideas I'm thinking about:
Atmospheric Chemical Kinetics
OpenAI's ChatGPT as writing tutor
Should I quit? It would free me to switch to a more worthy, interesting opportunity. Something more in line with my goals.
Do I know what it means to write for the benefit of others?
Interstitial Journaling
The Indian Monk Tilopa's Six Nails and how they relate to mindfulness.
I'm thinking about the tension between what is easy, fun, and comfortable and what adds value to my life.
How do I physically review my ZK notes and journal entries? How do I make sense of this process? How do I connect with what is valuable in this process?
The ephemerality of thought.
Self-mentoring.
Things I'm reading:
Lispector, Clarice and Costa, Margaret Jull and Patterson, Robin and Valente, Paulo Gurgel. Too much of life: the complete crônicas. 2022.
Emerson, Hannah and Martin, Chris and Nisinzweig, Aviv. The kissing of kissing: poems. 2022.
Davis, Lydia. Essays one. 2020.
Chabon, Michael. The Yiddish Policemen's Union. 2008.
Music I'm listening to:
SUSS
Jazz for Study
Jeff Oster - howling loon
★★★★★
The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

Compiled emacs 29.1 on Linux x86_64 with webkit2gtk-2.42.1 and the configure options `--with-xwidgets` and `--with-pgtk`. I tried opening a url with `xwidget-webkit-browse-url`, but emacs crashed with the error:
 "ERROR **: 12:43:15.326: GDK is not able to create a GL context: The current backend does not support OpenGL."
 which is weird, because `eglinfo` does not report anything out of the ordinary. 
 xwidgets has always been finicky for me and there's very little information available on the internet so I'd be interested in knowing if others have got it to work and it's just a problem with my setup.

 My problem: I've been attending a class and downloaded all the lectures. Unfortunately, each lecture is in a folder named [lecture-xyz], and its subtitle twin is [lecture-xyz]_subtitles. It was annoying to find the current lecture because nothing was sorted. I decided to prefix each folder with a number so they would sort correctly in my file manager (and dired).
 The Initial Approach: I'd jump between the course website and my file manager, renaming folders one by one. It was a tedio…]]></summary>

 In this post I will show how to significantly improve the performance of combinator based reducers by using a alternative abstraction algorithms. These algorithms are based on the paper λ to SKI, Semantically by Oleg Kiselyov and closely follow Ben Lynn’s implementation of Kiselyov’s ideas.
 I will also give detailed comparisons of the different approaches regarding emitted code size and execution performance on different reducers.

 In particular, I need the following functionality:
  
Automatic newline when | is typed; and
 Indent and newline when [ is typed.
  
I have been looking into different ways of doing this, and I have come up with the following:
  
Using electric-layout-mode, e.g. (add-to-list 'electric-layout-rules '(?| . before)); and
 Using electric-indent-mode, e.g. (setq-local electric-indent-chars (append electric-indent-chars '(?\[))).
  
I have also read about the electric-pairs-mode which might be more appropriate for the latter. There are also more manual ways of doing this, with hooks (post self insert hooks?).
 However, I am struggling to find any documentation on any electric functions, and different other major modes do these kind of things in different ways. My question is: what is the best way to do what I am after? If there is one function that I can bundle both of these features in, then that might be better. But maybe it's best that I keep these separate in case the user wants to enable, for example, layout mode but not pairs mode.
 I'd love to hear from developers of major modes with experience implementing such a feature!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: New to Haskell and looking for an existing tool that can automatically insert traceShow statements for debugging. Also open to alternative suggestions or better ways to debug. Thanks in advance! 
 Hello, Haskell enthusiasts! 👋
 I'm new to Haskell and I've been exploring the language through a project I'm working on. To debug my code, I've been manually inserting `traceShow` statements from the Debug.Trace module. While I find this method effective, it's also quite time-consuming.
 Problem Statement:
 I'm wondering if there's an existing tool that can automate the insertion of `traceShow` statements into Haskell code at key points. This would significantly streamline my debugging process.
 haskell
 -- Example: Original Code getMiddle2 :: String -> String getMiddle2 sourceString | isOddLength = takeMiddle 1 | otherwise = takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength = length sourceString ... 
 What I Would Like the Tool to Produce:
 haskell
 -- Example: With traceShow statements getMiddle2 :: String -> String getMiddle2 sourceString | traceShow ("Checking isOddLength:", isOddLength) isOddLength = traceShow ("Taking middle 1:", takeMiddle 1) takeMiddle 1 | otherwise = traceShow ("Taking middle 2:", takeMiddle 2) takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength = traceShow ("Source Length:", sourceLength) length sourceString ... 
 What I've Considered:
 I've thought about crafting a tool myself that involves parsing the Haskell source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then traversing this tree to insert `traceShow` statements. But before going down that rabbit hole, I wanted to consult the community. Is there already a tool out there that can help me with this?
 Open to Suggestions:
 Being new to Haskell, I'm also open to any advice or alternative approaches for debugging or learning the language. If there's a better way to do things, I'm all ears! 🐰
 Thank you for any recommendations, experiences, or advice you can share. I appreciate it! 🙏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am delving into the development of a turn-based card game and exploring technology stack options. Considering the essential need for distributed, fault-tolerant, and high-availability systems in the game, I am leaning towards utilizing Scala and Akka. The revenue scope of the project stays within the bounds making Akka usage free. 
 Here are a few points I'm pondering upon:
  
How effective is Akka in managing distributed systems for a gaming application, especially concerning fault tolerance and high availability?
 
For a turn-based card game, does Scala (along with Akka) provide a viable and efficient development pathway, or should I be looking at different languages/libraries?
 
If you have experience using Scala/Akka in game development, are there any pitfalls or challenges that you encountered which might be insightful for a beginner in this stack?
 
 Any insights, alternative suggestions, or experiences shared will be incredibly valuable. Thank you!

 Quick question: why no colons in extension methods? Object and class declarations use colons to group things neatly (methods, fields), but extension methods don't. What's the rationale behind this syntax difference? Is it just a stylistic choice or something more?

I like a lot of the advantages that emacs provides not being restricted to being a terminal app. However, despite it's huge potential, I don't know how people use it productively, I mean afaik it's as potent as an OS so you can do crazy things like "making a script to get code from anywhere" so... Basically I want to ask you about the features that you like the most. I'm not a guy who is going to use just ONE editor tho, I have to use VSCode for several stuff, I use orgmode for... well documenting, organizing (I should use the code features that it provides, which blew my mind) and oc I use nvim. I want to know what are the things that people do that boosted their productivity in emacs vs other editors, I think each one has their strengths and weaknesses. Ty in advance.

 Some searching showed me some really hacky things like creating two windows at the top and bottom, abusing faces, and other things.
 This seems like a trivial thing. Is this really not built in? I can play pong, run a terminal, manage X windows, browse the web, but I can't add top and bottom margin without hacks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Projectile seems intent on sub-dividing my npm-based monorepo despite having placed this defun specifying that it should only consider a project root if it's a vc-root-dir:
 ;; we need this wrapper to match Projectile's API (defun projectile-vc-root-dir (dir) "Retrieve the root directory of the project at DIR using `vc-root-dir'." (let ((default-directory dir)) (vc-root-dir))) (setq projectile-project-root-functions '(projectile-vc-root-dir)) 
 That was taken line-for-line from the Projectile docs. Despite this, and despite nuking all of my Projectile projects/caches (to be 100% sure), anytime I open a library directory within my monorepo; Projectile will consider that a new project and act accordingly (i.e. I can no longer search outside of that library's directory). To put it more explicitly:
 / monorepo-root | |--libraryA |--libraryB 
 ... when I initially enter my project and search for a file, I can see that Projectile is correctly searching through all directories. However, when I then enter into, say, libraryA and again try to search for files in the monorepo, Projectile is only searching under libraryA (I understand it as being seen as a different project in Projectile's eyes).
 Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When doing some functions like (shell-command) or (project-compile) the minibuffer has control of the cursor meaning the text can be manipulated using the various text editing commands. 
 When in I-search though the cursor only flashes to the minibuffer and then returns to the buffer so whenever I do the text editing commands it edits the actual buffer and not the I-search target phrase.
 Is there a way to make I-search take control of the cursor in a similar way to the others? I tried swiper which takes control but it is very slow for me when search large files ~3000 lines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 now that the Matrix bridge for libera.chat is closed, I'm trying to use irc the proper way with an irc client.
 I've a ZNC server running and it expects username and password in this format username:password , but ERC expects it in two seperate fields, one for each.
 This is what I currently have in my config:
 ;; C-c erc, keybinding will start erc (global-set-key "\C-cerc" (lambda () (interactive) (erc-ssl :server "zncserver.org" :port "6697" :nick "nickiename" :password "password123"))) 
 and this is the format ZNC server instruction page has:
 /server zncserver.org 6697 username:password 
 When I try the above ERC config, connection to the ZNC server fails.
 Then I tried using :nick "nickiename:password123" format in above ERC config, then connection was sucessful however ERC doesn't recognize the second half as password and uses the whole as nick and ZNC server asks for the password again.
 How can I resolve this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was recently looking through someone's .emacs repo and saw they were using use-package chords for avy. I decided to give it a try. I can see the potential but it seems too slow. I'm forced to pause typing for a moment to allow it to register the chord before I can choose the char to go-to.
 I attached a gif below first showing what it looks like with a pause and then what happens when I type all the necessary commands in sequence. (in my case jw for avy-got-word and then o to go to words beginning with 'o')
 my setup is shown below
 (use-package avy
 :chords
 ("jw" . avy-goto-word-1))
 Is there anything i can do to make it more smooth and reliable?

 I recently hopped on the Emacs train and I came across an article where this screenshot was shared. I really liked the colors, fonts and the way it just looked. I was wondering if that was an available theme to download and if anyone could point me to it. I tried image searching, looking maybe the Doom Emacs themes, but could not find something that resembles it.

 ```elisp
 (use-package evil

 (setq evil-want-keybinding nil)
 (evil-mode t)
 :bind
 (:map evil-insert-state-map
 ("C-c" . evil-force-normal-state) ("C-h" . evil-delete-backward-char-and-join)) 
 :config
 (evil-set-undo-system 'undo-redo)) ```
 why does the above snippet work and the below snippet does not?
 ```elisp
 (use-package evil
 :init
 (setq evil-want-keybinding nil)
 :bind
 (:map evil-insert-state-map
 ("C-c" . evil-force-normal-state) ("C-h" . evil-delete-backward-char-and-join)) 
 :config
 (evil-mode t)
 (evil-set-undo-system 'undo-redo))
 ```
 But the same work of I remove :bind block i.e.
 ```elisp
 (use-package evil
 :init
 (setq evil-want-keybinding nil)
 :config
 (evil-mode t)
 (evil-set-undo-system 'undo-redo))
 ``` can anyone please help me with this? I mean what happens when the I set (evil-mode t) in :config block vs in :init block? I mean what difference is the :bind block causing that I need to shift (evil-mode t) from :config block to :init block

 I wanted to share a new emacs package I've been working on, which is built on top of another project I created ~6 years ago. I let vzi bitrot for too long. I live inside emacs to the extent that I can, but one of the areas I've long been frustrated in is the ability to visualize data controlled from an emacs buffer. I've lately been enjoying deno, and got inspired and decided to finally rewrite vzi using it. Of course, I needed to be able to control it all from emacs with a few keystrokes, and hence vzi.el was born. If you are like me, you might appreciate these packages.
 The rough architecture of vzi is that it controls the browser remotely using the chrome devtools protocol, and pipes data to a host page from stdin. A final html report…]]></summary>

 why does the above snippet work and the below snippet does not?
 ```elisp

 ```elisp
 (use-package evil
 :init
 (setq evil-want-keybinding nil)
 :config
 (evil-mode t)
 (evil-set-undo-system 'undo-redo))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A tip and questions about org-table formulas.
 I often use the bottom of a table to calculate some statistics (here in this example it is always just the sum of the column). To easily deduce, what was calculated, I like to add a simple string to the result (in this example it is always "Sum:"). 
 Now here is an example with the various methods I know to achieve this:
 | just append | it fails | utilize calc | plain elisp | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | | 3 | - | - | - | | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | | 8 | - | - | - | | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 55 Sum | m | Sum: 44 | Sum: 44 | #+TBLFM: @>$1=vsum(@I$1..@III$1) Sum #+TBLFM: @>$2=vsum(@I$2..@III$2);N Sum #+TBLFM: @>$3='(format "Sum: %s" (calcFunc-vsum @I$3..@III$3));N #+TBLFM: @>$4='(format "Sum: %i" (apply #'+ (mapcar #'string-to-number '(@I$4..@III$4)))) 
 As you can see, the first method fails in the second column, due to not all data are numbers.
 Now my question(s): How do you deal with calculating some column statistical data and what do you do to identify the results later? Have you maybe written a nice wrapper around those methods to make them easier to write/use them as table formulas?

The cabal project has been making great use of theirs (#hackage on Libera IRC), but it seemed to me that there was no equivalent for stack users and devs. I did some digging and discovered four stack-related chat rooms:
  
#stack-users and #stack-collaborators on the Haskell Foundation slack (the current maintainer is there)
 #haskell-stack on Libera IRC
 #haskell-stack:matrix.org on Matrix (created in 2018; was bridged to Libera for a while; the past and current maintainers are there)
  
All of these are currently low activity, but the Matrix room in particular has recently been spruced up and I'd like to invite you there to get and give help. Stack users, stack developers, stackage curators, haskell package maintainers, interested spectators - all are welcome. Hope to see you there!

 There's a lot of calendar/appointment options for org-mode, but I am not an org user, and was intrigued by the built in diary/calendar pair. After experimenting with them for a bit, and finding out there are built ins for:
 1. converting ics files to dairy-mode entries
 2. displaying notification for upcoming events
 3. communicating with DAV servers 
 I decided to try to build a package to sync events between diary files and a CalDAV server. I never quite figured out #3 but I was already so into the package that it didn't matter :)

Convenience in the Haskell ecosystem by bradrn
My motivation yesterday was wanting to do a spot of data analysis. Nothing complicated: essentially, I just needed to plot some fields from a JSON file.
Episode 34 – Lindsey Kuper by The Haskell Interlude
In this episode Niki Vazou and Wouter Swierstra chat with Lindsey Kuper, Assistant Professor at University of California, Santa Cruz. They discuss what to do when your data center gets hit by a tornado, life in academia versus life in industry, and what is choreographic programming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Org agenda is populated differently for today than for any other day. It fills the "todo" area with all the pending tasks. This is not done for any other day -- not for yesterday or for next month, when it shows only the agenda items that are active for that day or spanning that day. There are obvious performance reasons for this, and it is usually what I want -- except for when I am doing my daily journaling, when it would be massively useful to pull up the agenda AS IF I were on a previous day (usually "yesterday"). I only need this to be done once, for when I am journaling. How can I make a "view as today" command for my orgmode agenda?

Command line interface (CLI) tools have a reputation for being difficult
to use.

Whilst powerful once mastered, a CLI inherently lacks a litany of user
interface “nice-to-haves”, simply by virtue of its medium:
Simplicity: Common tasks should be easy to perform. This is often
not the case, but worse is when tasks can be tweaked in myriad ways,
leading to a combinatorial explosion of flags, options and modifiers.
Memorability: How does one remember all those different options?
It’s not realistic, which is why we so often resort to double-checking
the usage text, man pages, or search engine/generative AI du jour.
Discoverability: Reminding ourselves how to perform what we know
(or assume) can be done isn’t the same as guiding us towards the full

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for a comfortable way to use emacs for ssh-ing to the servers of our company, but still having issues. Non solution is ideal. I have to use a proxy command to login as a user and after logged in can use sudo to get root.
 My preferred solution in emacs would be eshells cd /ssh: way. With this I also have the default directory synchronized and can easily use C-x C-f to edit files. Tab completion works too, as long I do not sudo -i .
 If I do - completions will break, which is not ideal because I have several scripts in the root path which I need to complete.
 If I leave the eshell way and use mx-shell oder eat-shell etc. I will have tab completion everywhere but the directory is not synched.
 I know I can just type C-x C-f /ssh:user@host|sudo::/file
 But the hostnames we are using are quite long and generic. So this would be a bit of a hazzle.
 Does anyone has a hint for me how I could come around this?
 My last idea would be a small function which gets the hostname from the eat buffer and triggers find-files with the correct path. But maybe there is something better and yes - I would prefer eshell for the whole thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, I created a toy clone of git using Haskell. I have been on and off learning Haskell for a while but never really did anything practical using it. Most resources (that I encountered) just teach you what monads are and that's about it. I had the hang of monads for a while but never really had the confidence to make something practical using Haskell.
 Recently I decided to change that by doing some practical stuff using Haskell. So I present to you Hagit: A git clone written in Haskell. It is fairly limited but if you really try you can actually do version control using it (at least locally). It can also clone a repo.
 I have also extensively documented what I have done. As for how my experience was, I really enjoyed it, baring a few annoyances. The code is probably not idiomatic, as this is more or less my first attempt at making something practical with Haskell. If you have some time at your hand and want to dive into git internals please give it a read (the readme has links to 3 articles that have the details) and if possible please suggest what I could have done better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellows,
 through work, I have discovered TimeTimers some years ago. I have found it easy to work with, which is why I've bought one for myself. However, I've been meaning to have something like this in emacs, because I've noticed that no matter the package (be it built-in or tmr), I am missing the convenience that a TimeTimer provides.
 First off, I'd like to know if any of you know a package that does this or something like this: conveniently display (in the modeline, maybe?) a bar or clock that shows the passage of time in a continuous fashion, i.e. showing a graphic representation (like a bar going from full to empty or a pie chart going from full to empty) instead of changing numbers (the customary form of representing a timer in my experience).
 If that's not a thing -- and I'd be flabbergasted about that to be frank --, I'd love to get some tips on how to implement this. If I were to choose, I'd preferably have a timetimer implemented as a decreasing progress bar in the mode line. The width would be depending upon the "available space" (dunno if there is a way to find that out for different configurations of modelines), the progress bar would be recalculated in regular intervals and the (pseudo-)continuous steps would be calculated depending on the time input when setting the timer. Maybe, the progress bar could "blink" (i.e. disappear and reappear) an amount of times to be set by a variable. For graphical representation, I am eyeing the SVG-LIB by Nicolas Rougier.
 I am grateful for tips and pointers, I am a bit at a loss as to where to start.
 Have a good day!

But that's not true! I can't give you a Haskell library package, not even in source form, and have it be usable in your environment!
 Cabal packages can only reference other packages in one of three cases:
  
If the package is available on Hackage.
 If both packages are part of the same directory structure.
 If the referencing package hardcodes the exact path to the referenced package.
  
None of those is suitable for third-party distribution of packages outside of Hackage!
 How is a package usable on another computer if it hard-codes the exact location of every dependency it has?
 C has an include path. Java has an include path. Why does Haskell require a .cabal file to hard code the path to all of its dependencies?!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! Last week I released version 0.4 of ekg, which is an extensible tag-based, sqlite-backed note taking application for emacs.
 This version has been in the works for months, and has notable improvements:
 Drafts! You can now save (with C-x C-s) long notes and they will be tagged with "draft" and not show in other places until you commit the note.
 Magic tags! You can now have tags that automatically execute some elisp, useful for special notes that need some different editing. The standard example is setting your input method for notes with a tag indicating it's in a different language.
 LLM integration! Now you can have LLMs response to your notes inline, with prompts configured based on your tags. We use the new GNU ELPA llm package, so we support whatever it supports (right now Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex's APIs)
 File notes! Just like you can have notes on URLS, can you now have notes on files! It's basically a way to annotate any file. And because of how our prompt, template, and prefixing rules work, the directory structure can control the templates and prompts for any LLM integration you have.
 Also, here's a video demonstrating these features!
 Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, notably Jay Rajput, Umar Ahmad and Qingshui Zheng!

 VSCode doesn't recognize implicit returns so you have to unindent manually when you move to the beginning of the next line if youre starting a new function and indent manually when you start a function. Scalafmt doesn't recognize bad indentation either.
 Intellij Idea object MyProgram: def abs(n: Int): Int = if n < 0 then -n else n private def formatAbs(x: Int) = <-- val msg = "The absolute value of %d is %d" <-- Metals doesn't indent msg.format(x, abs(x)) <--Metals doesn't indent @ main def hello: Unit = println(formatAbs(-42)) 
 I tried Idea and their support is even worse it wouldn't even let me unindent the private which defaulted to the indentation level of the `else` statement in the abs function. 
 How can I get VSCode to behave correctly? I don't really want to manually adjust indentation on every line every time that just seems tedious.
 Edit: from my research I can just use curly braces after the = in definitions and this will enforce the indentation rules. https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/other-new-features/indentation.html
 Is this safe/reasonable to do? I imagine it’s not idiomatic, but having to do this manually will drive me nuts. 
 I want to learn FP but this is really I convenient if this isn’t viable I’ll probably just opt to learn Ocaml instead.

 tree-sitter doesn't recognize FOOPTY_API since it's a dllexport, and I think it's probably a windows-only construct. How would I go about making sure it parses that part properly?
 Also, the GENERATED_BODY() specifier is an Unreal-ism, and I don't think it causes any trouble, but it would be nice if I could add it (and other Unreal specific identifiers) to a list for specific highlighting and/or indentation instructions. 
 Where's a good place to start with these sort of small-scale tweaks? I've seen some links to posts with titles like, "Let's write a major mode" but I'm really just trying to tweak the existing C++ mode to handle a couple weirdo special cases. (Though I think maybe the dllexport thing MIGHT be big enough that it should be included, so maybe I should file a bug?)

Just out of curiousity, I wanted to know if there is a way to use optics to solve it. Now, I know that I could write a function like this: runs :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [[a]] that finds all the runs of elements, based on a predicate and make a traversal out of it, but if I already had a function like this, there would be no point in doing that. So, my question is: is there a way to use just optics to succinctly solve this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let the following be functors
 newtype F x = F x instance Functor F where fmap f (F x) = F $ f x newtype G x = G x instance Functor G where fmap f (G x) = G $ f x 
 Then the following is a Natural transformation
 eta :: F a -> G a eta (F a) = G a 
 Which can be seen (though not proved, as it would require singletons) by providing the definition for the legs of the natural transformation.
 etaLeg1 :: (a -> b) -> F a -> G b etaLeg1 f = eta . fmap f etaLeg2 :: (a -> b) -> F a -> G b etaLeg2 f = fmap f . eta 
 Now, let the following be functors (The following does not type check. Or I don't know how to make it type check.)
 newtype Monoid x => F' x = F' x instance Functor F' where fmap f (F' x) = F' $ f x newtype Monoid x => G' x = G' x instance Functor G' where fmap f (G' x) = G' $ f x 
 In both instances, f is a monoid homomorphism. The above can be seen to make sense by defining the following, which are basically restricted fmap's:
 fmapF' :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) => (a -> b) -> F' a -> F' b fmapF' f (F' x) = F' $ f x fmapG' :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) => (a -> b) -> G' a -> G' b fmapG' f (G' x) = G' $ f x 
 Would, then, the following be a "Restricted" Natural Transformation?
 phi :: Monoid a => F' a -> G' a phi (F' a) = G' a phiLeg1 :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) => (a -> b) -> F' a -> G' b phiLeg1 f = phi . fmapF' f phiLeg2 :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) => (a -> b) -> F' a -> G' b phiLeg2 f = fmapG' f . phi 
 It seems to be obvious that phi is a natural transformation, but I can't shake the feeling that something could be wrong.

That's fair enough, but it has it's problems. When an imported library changes the only sensible way to deal with it is to stop the python process and start another one. (That's because in Python the built in "import" statement doesn't reload the file. You could reload each library with reload, but that would be tricky.)
 For that reason, I would like to use M-x compile. It's suitable for that kind of thing and I've used it for running programs written in other languages. (I think this is a fairly well known Emacs trick).
 The problem is Venvs. My projects use venv. If I just start a fresh python using M-x compile then it won't be in the right venv. I've thought about writing a batch file to solve this problem. I expect though, someone has already written a package to solve this?
 Is there such a package?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A variation of this question have been asked before, unfortunately, I am not bright enough to understand them. So I am asking this question to hopefully get a more concrete answer from a particularly generous haskeller.
 When I researched the type of IO in haskell, I get this from ghci info:
 (GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld -> (# GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld, a #))
 I am not quite sure what any of this means, but from what I gather, this abstracts to something like this: IO _ := (RealWorld -> (RealWorld, _ )). This looks like the state monad, which has type: [W, W × _ ], for a choice of state handling type W. The StateT monad I see in documentation is a little different since it has monad composition StateT (s -> m (a, s)), so I guess I should say that we require the monad m to be the idenitity monad. 
 My question is, why do we need to use these primitive types? Somehow, this makes it possible for IO functions to interact with the outside environment, like call other programs or writing to the file system. But how does that happen exactly? 
 Second, what is this RealWorld? Is it a bitestring? An integer? A constant? When updating the state, what actually happens? 
 Lastly, the ST monad, which has definition: ST s a. This type allows us to perform mutations to inside variables but it does not allow effects. From what I gather, this does in fact mutate memory. It also has a function to "escape" the ST wrapper, called runST. Obviously, this makes practical sense, but what is stopping up from simply writing a function runIO that escapes the IO. That would most certainly be a bug, but what is preventing us from doing it?

 (add-hook 'elfeed-new-entry-hook (lambda (entry) (alert (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-content entry)) :title (concat (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) " -_ " (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) ) :severity 'high ))) 
 But changing elfeed-entry-title (on the 5th line) to elfeed-entry-tags or `elfeed-entry-feed makes it fail (no notifications appear anymore).
 Does anyone have any idea why?
 UPDATE: Solved it (defun created for debugging):
 (defun elfeed-desktop-notifications (entry) "Parse and display new feeds as desktop notifications." (alert (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-content entry)) :title (concat (elfeed-feed-title (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-feed entry))) "\n" (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) ) :severity 'high )) (add-hook 'elfeed-new-entry-hook #'elfeed-desktop-notifications)

If Idris had the same community size as Haskell and the same maturity, would you choose Idris instead?

 I use it quite often for other programs, but emacs ignores it (vanilla emacs 29.1, launched without init.el (-Q option).
 Have you succeeded in making it work ? In general, I am curious as to how the sync between clipboard and kill-ring is done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I've recently made another video about my 3D game engine project Game :: Dangerous (written in Haskell), which can be found as follows.
 Project repos: https://github.com/Mushy-pea
 Video: https://youtu.be/wOSQ1cYoZXM?si=bF2UtM_zr8OYOPHi
 I'm interested in what people think about some of the design choices I've made. One of the most interesting things to me about software development is how design and implementation interact. So briefly, the engine is not a development framework such as Unity or Unreal (nor anywhere near that complex) but more similar to GZDoom for example. It's a program that loads a text file, within which is encoded environment geometry, game logic scripting and references to asset files. The game logic scripting is implemented through a virtual machine in the engine that runs a bytecode form of the engine's custom scripting language.
 I spent a long time deciding how to implement a map editor, when I probably should have decided early on and developed it in parallel. What I eventually decided to do (in June 2022) was to write a local web server that loaded the same map files as the engine, allowed their state to be queried and modified through API requests from a client and could save that state back to the same text file format. That server now makes up about 20% of the Haskell code in the main repo and shares some static libraries with the engine. I've also started writing the web client that provides a UI for the map editor, a prototype of which is shown in the video.
 Anyway, thanks for reading and looking forward to feedback if anyone feels like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a general question, though it comes up because I've started using Emacs 29 and tree-sitter.
 There are 4 presets listed for tree-sitter, with a few more for the standard C(++) modes:
  
Gnu
 BSD
 Linux
 K&R
  
Where in any of the emacs documentation are these indentation styles explained? I eventually found them on wikipedia, but that's frankly a terrible cop-out on the documentation side. The manual helpfully gives shrug-emoji style descriptions like this, for the BSD style: "Also known as “Allman style” after Eric Allman." 
 Moreover, I'd like to know what exactly emacs (or tree-sitter) thinks these styles mean. Just because there's a definition on wikipedia doesn't mean that's what's being adhered to.
 But even better is if I could just use the clang-format style in real time, rather than waiting for it to clean up after me. Is there anything that already does that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone else have the same problem?
 If I run sage-shell:run-sage to get a SageMath shell in Emacs, and run help(), I get the standard help message, which starts with "Welcome to Sage 10.1!".
 But if I try help(diff) or any other specific function, Emacs hangs. Doing C-g allows me to use Emacs again, but the SageMath session is no longer responsive: trying to enter any other command results in hanging. Even C-c C-d no longer works, I have to try C-c C-\ and wait for the SageMath kernel to crash, or do M-x kill-process.
 This all seemed to work before I upgraded Emacs and changed my package manager to straight.el.
 I'm on Emacs 29.1, using sage-shell-mode v0.3.
 I've covnfigured it as follows:
 (use-package sage-shell-mode :straight t :defer t :custom (sage-shell:sage-executable (executable-find "sage")) (sage-shell:set-ipython-version-on-startup nil) (sage-shell:check-ipython-version-on-startup nil) (sage-shell:use-prompt-toolkit nil) (sage-shell:use-simple-prompt nil) ) 
 (However, I find that the custom settings aren't being respected either ...)
 I also use ob-sagemath, which allows me to use SageMath in org-src-blocks, which works fine as far as I can tell.

Lets say I want to catch up on the GPT agents of generative AI and prompt engineering. I google the topic in EWW and just read with a org file open on the side buffer. I want to take notes and capture quotes into a that org file. when I select text from EWW, and intiate capture I want to insert text into the org file on the side where the point (cursor) is or even at the end of the file. How can I configure org-capture for this?
 EDIT:
 Think of it like this. I want to have a org file each reading session and I have have multiple reading sessions in parallel (session don't mean single chunk of time). How can i configure org-capture so that I can create a new org file for each reading session. or org-capture is not the right tool for this? Some other workflow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I just stumbled upon a difference between the Scala 2 and Scala 3 compilers that originated in at least one bug in the form of NullPointerExceptions, that we didn't have to worry about before.
 It's super simple to reproduce, given a REPL:Scala 3.3.1
 scala> val test: String = test val test: String = null 
 Scala 2.13.11
 scala> val test: String = test ^ warning: value test does nothing other than call itself recursively val test: String = null 
 That warning is the difference between knowing that you are doing something weird or not. Although I'm not sure why this is even a warning and not an error, when would you ever want to initialize a variable by assigning to itself?Is this something that should be fixed in the Scala 3 compiler? 
 EDIT: this is already a known issue https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/14429

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dotty-cps-async 0.9.19 ( https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async ) is on Maven Central.
 New in this release:
  
Optional loom support for JDK-21. With the help of Loom, we can transform arguments of high-order functions without requiring a shifted variant of this function to be available.
  
​
 def topScored[A](c:Iterable[A], n: Int)(score: A=>Double) = c.map(a=>(a,score(a)).sortBy(- _._2).take(n) ... val top100 = topScore(c,100)(a => await(fetchScore(a.id)) 
 Note that this also works for effect monads.
  
Direct context encoding: it's still under experimental annotation but much closer to full functionality. Now we can call a direct-encoded function over G[_] in the context of F[_] if the inclusion of G in F. This can be a foundation for the natural encoding of monadic effect stacks:
 type IOResource = [X]=>>Resource[IO,X]
 def open(name: Path, options: OpenOption*)(using CpsDirect[IOResource]): AsynchronousFileChannel =
 .....
 def read(input: AsynchronousFileChannel, bufSize: Int)(using CpsDirect[IO]): ByteBuffer =
 ....
 //Then later inside asyncScope[IO]:
 val channel = open(name, READ)
 val data = read(input, BUF_SIZE) 
 ....
 
A few bug fixes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs users, I'm currently trying to re-do my own emacs configuration but after facing thousands of issues, indenting buffers is the one thing that's going to turn me bald in a matter of hours.
 I'm trying to work with multiple languages, Go, Rust, Python, JS/TS, etc. The one thing I haven't figured out correctly is proper indentation without having to do keyboard gymnastics. I know that Emacs is more of a DIY thing, so any light shed here would be of great help. 
 I've already tried (add-hook …), using the :config section in my (use-package go-mode) declarations and more but none of them are having any visible effect. 
 Furthermore, I saw this issue with Go and I heavily suspect other programming languages won't come out as clean as I think. 
 Every time I edit a Go file, when adding a new line to anything that needs indentation (e.g: a function body, if, for, etc.) Two “4 spaces” tabs are inserted no matter what. Even when I press the <TAB> key I have to backspace ALWAYS, also some closing delimiters like }) don't align properly, but I suspect that's another issue maybe fixed by puni.
 ​
 The “best” thing I could do to prevent newlines from getting messed up on creation was turning off electric-indent, I've heard mixed opinions on that, some say it's great, some say it's terrible, I don't really know. Without electric-indent I don't have to backspace two tabs on a newline, but TAB still creates those two tabs, even when my modeline reports (TABx4). Here is a snippet of the important stuff in my configuration file. 
 (setq-default c-basic-offset 4 tab-width 4 indent-tabs-mode t standard-indent 4) ;; jsjsjsjs (electric-pair-mode 1) ;; Disable electric-indent messing up my code >:( (setq electric-indent-inhibit t electric-indent-mode nil) 
 If any of you could spare your elisp-fu powers to me, I would be extremely thankful. Thanks for your time in advance. :)

 Does anyone know how I can forse C-c C-a to run Biber as well as the other commands? 
 My config is pretty vanilla and for AUCTeX is as follows: ``` ;; Auctex (require 'package) (unless (package-installed-p 'auctex) (package-install 'auctex))
 (require 'tex)
 (push (list 'output-pdf "Skim") TeX-view-program-selection) ```
 I'm running Emacs 29.1 downloaded from MacPorts on a MacBook Air m1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I understand function with class constraints are transformed into a function with an extra parameter being the typeclass dictionary. This allows the function to not have to be specialized and only decide at runtime what to do exactly (sorry for the bad explanation). In short Show a => a -> String is transform internally to Dict a -> a -> String.
 I have a discussion on discourse where people consider this extra parameter as part of the function: Show a -> a -> String has TWO parameters.
 My intuition is that this extra parameter is only the result of an implementtaion choice. An hypotetical compiler could work back from the main an instantiate all functions with required types. Therefore passing a class dictionaly might be needed for practical reason but not in theory.
 Am I right or is dictionary passin the only way to implement typeclass in Haskell ?

 Is there a programming language mode that will be suitable for this format?
 If not, is there a mode which can do the following, or something close to these?
  
Backspace at whitespace indents properly with previous block
 Ability to collapse and expand blocks depending on indent level or matching brace
 spell check using words already used in the buffer

 These 3 dots; I want to be able to click them to open/close the code. I searched quite a bit and found nothing about having them open/close with mouse. If they can be opened/closed with keyboard as well even better, but mainly I want to with mouse.
 The language I use is python.

So far I’ve been coding in the scratch buffer and executing blocks, but that seems really inefficient, I’m sure there is another way, more so in the case of writing long packages. 
 I’m used to coding in Python in emacs using the repl which includes a python interactive console, but I cannot find the equivalent for emacs lisp.
 I would be grateful if you could point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance for your help.

 conf { content } 
 I am aware that I need to setup indent-line-function to make this work, but I don't know enough Elisp to write a function to parse the file and make the proper indentation. A hack I thought of is use to use another's mode indent function like nginx's nginx-indent-line. I could also copy the function and use it by itself, not requiring to load the mode, but I don't know if this is the most appropriate way to handle this problem.
 EDIT: I already use Alexander-Miller/i3wm-Config-Mode which only improves the syntax highlighting.

They are quite slow too. Here's the link to my config file. How can I improve the completions? I would also like it to highlight unused imports (flycheck isn't doing it, idk why). Just this much would suffice :) I don't need anything else from a code-editor (although Emacs is so much more than that).

 I'm new to emacs and so far it's really easy to use and it's very effective. One annoying thing however is that every time I edit the code I'm writing, I have to quit() in the interpreter, close the window (Ctrl-x + 0), restart the interpreter (Ctrl-c + Ctrl-p) and reimport the code.
 I edit the code and then just write "import *script*" but the changes don't appear unless I do it as mentioned above.
 Even if I just quit(), I can't just (Ctrl-c + Ctrl-p) again because I have to close the buffer for it to start again.
 Is it supposed to be like this? Or am I doing something wrong?
 Thanks in advance!

 I'm quite new to emacs, ubuntu and all those stuff; I'm studying computer science, I'm a first year and we're using Linux and (I'm using) emacs. On the school computers we have to input given commands in the Linux console to get access to the "import cv2", but I do most of my work home and I have a windows.
 I was then wondering how I can download (?) and make it so I can import "cv2" and use it's commands like "cv2.imread('plane.jpg')" and so on. I've searched on google but found nothing useful.
 I'm kind of just starting out so I don't understand what it means to "mix"/"import" OpenCV into emacs and such things. I have downloaded OpenCV (I think) but I couldn't just start emacs and start using the functions from "import cv2".
 ​
 Short question: How can I use the "import cv2" on emacs and start working with pictures? As beginner friendly as possible.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that the future of vim is uncertain, I am looking at emacs as I see the project is quite active and there's still a very healthy ecosystem of plugin development. I am not interested in neovim as they have removed a critical feature to my work (cscope) and I feel that they do not value the kind of stability and support for working with older tools and languages that I need.
 I mainly work on real time kernels for embedded systems, boot loaders, etc. written in C. I also frequently write in Make, Bash, Rust, Python, and Go. I use a very minimal set of Vim plugins, primarily ALE for linting and LSP support and fzf for finding files, symbols (with ripgrep) etc. Frequently, LSPs are not a perfect fit for my work because of the large index size and the need to switch between different workin…]]></summary>

 Wondering if there's module that highlights the current syntax tree branch (or de-emphasizes the rest) in the editor like this:
  
function 
 statement 1
 statement 2
 branch 
 sub branch
 some code
 sub branch 2
 
 
  
I imagine such feature would be very useful for multiple if-else, case(s), and other nested code with lots of leafs

 But there are reasons why I would like to stick to markdown for my general note-taking.
 So I was wondering if it's possible to: 1. Make org-mode recognise.md files (I know this is YES). 2. Make org-mode pick-up TODO states from org-mode headings appearing in .md files with otherwise md syntax (*** TODO Read this, somewhere in md file) and show it in agenda. 3. Or even make org-mode recognise some md elements (headings or Obsidian-style checkboxes) with TODO states.
 I know 1 is possible, though not sure who uses this for what. I think 2 might be possible? And would probably be exactly what I need. Option 3 smells like somethink no-one should ever attempt, yet I'm not sure why (not).
 Thanks!!

 each case class shares the definition for "update" methods that use the copy function that they get from being case classes. Since the methods are all the same I want to declare them once in the trait definition but can't because it would require using copy() which is automatically generated for case classes. 
 I'm new to Scala but this seems like an issue that would come up often unless I am not writing in the best Scala style or it's not that big of an inconvenience.
 are case classes syntactic sugar for normal classes that inherit or extend a special class or trait that I exploit?

 From what I've read so far there isn't necessarily a "correct" way to configure emacs but I'm asking for a critique on anything in this module. Whether that be my use of use-package (especially as I've found its documentation somewhat unclear), my custom function, code style, or anything. I would appreciate any two cents or bits of wisdom as I begin my journey configuring emacs.

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring.
Ideas I'm thinking about:
My life is slowly imploding.
How I can be compassionate to myself. Let the breath coddle, hug, nurture, and fill me with wonder.
The tutoring possibilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT.
Blogging my notes.
Things I'm reading:
Lispector, Clarice and Costa, Margaret Jull and Patterson, Robin and Valente, Paulo Gurgel. Too much of life: the complete crônicas. 2022.
Music I'm listening to:
The 28-hour Jazz for Study Spotify playlist

The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a really niche, but simple package for elfeed that adds system notifications: https://github.com/flocks/elfeed-notifier/blob/master/elfeed-notifier.el
 However loading it by default with straight package manager doesn't work:
 (package! elfeed-notifier :recipe (:host github :repo "flocks/elfeed-notifier")) 
 Nothing happens, no function or variables are available.
 Does anyone know what's the standard procedure for loading such packages? I assume that it has something to do with use-package?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[through little bit of research i have found a way to make Emacs faster with lsp and eglot none of this are my code i just found it from browsing on reddit
 (fset #'jsonrpc--log-event #'ignore) remove laggy typing it probably reduces chatty json from lsp to eglot i guess
 (setq eglot-events-buffer-size 0) disabling event logging in eglot
 (setq eglot-sync-connect nil) disabling elgot freeze the UI for up to 3s when you open file maybe large one
 install gcmh package to increase the gc value when necessary and decrease it. nice package btw
 (add-hook 'focus-out-hook 'garbage-collect) optional, if you don't want to use gcmh package
 (setq eglot-connect-timeout nil) optional "my code actually"
 set this values on company package or
 (setq company-idle-delay 0) how long to wait for company mode to wait after it got completion obviously you don't want to wait so just set it to 0
 (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1) how many characters you want to type before popping up the completion UI obviously 1 right
 if there is anything that i am missing pls let me know guys, am new to Emacs i want to learn from you all. i would love to see your config too to learn how to configure mine too

 ./configure --with-native-compilation --with-pgtk --with-modules --with-cairo --with-x-toolkit=no
 When I open a PDF and enable pdf-tools with pdf-tools-install the performance is initially great. However, after I resize with +,- the performance dramatically drops, scrolling becomes extremely laggy to the point of being unusable. Resetting the buffer restores the performance. Running the profiler didn't illuminate anything useful.
 I've eliminated there being something in my configuration since the issue persists even when I run emacs with the -Q flag. Of note for my system I'm running on wayland. I'll post an update when I'm able to test on Xorg.
 Are there some packages that I might be missing on my system? Or some configuration options I might be missing?
 Thanks a million for the help!
 update issue appears on the same machine running xorg.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on my understanding, compile it without sudo might be a safer option. I recall that when I used the sudo installation of Emacs, the old binaries remained even after I removed Emacs with sudo make uninstall, make clean and make distclean.
 This is the way I compile Emacs right now: (Notice, I'm using sudo make install)
 $ ./autogen.sh $ ./configure --without-compress-install --with-native-compilation --with-json --with-mailutils --with-tree-sitter CC=gcc-12 $ make -j 4 $ sudo make install 
 If I were able to compile it in the home folder, I believe it would be safer in the sense that it wouldn't interfere with any system libraries, right? And it would be easier to uninstall, correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, 
 When I use the mouse to close a tab on the tab-line, all works as expected. The context menu choice "Close" removes the tab from the tab-line and buries the buffer. 
 However, when I call tab-line-close-tab() with M-x, or from a keybinding, or by evaluating it in *scratch*, this error is returned: (args-out-of-range 0 0). 
 Here's the relevant part of the backtrace: 
  
Debugger entered--Lisp error: (args-out-of-range 0 0) 
 tab-line--get-tab-property(tab nil) 
 tab-line-close-tab() 
 elisp--eval-last-sexp(t)
  
The Elisp for tab-line-close-tab() shows that it takes an optional argument, EVENT. I'm wondering this: if I provided an argument to EVENT, an argument to indicate something other than a mouse click, would the function then work? 
 The Elisp for tab-line-close-tab() is …]]></summary>

I'm also finding Voice control and dictation software to be severely lacking. But I do feel like with the right Emacs set up I should be able to do more with less)
 Has anyone had success using emacs to help deal with their RSI? On a basic level I'm thinking of things like auto capitalizing sentences after. Or some kind of English friendly hippie expand to auto complete words using context. In the dream version maybe you can occasionally dictate words and then feed that through Local LLM to fix up the inevitable problems. Also, personally, something like a super abbreviation module that was great at auto completing words or guessing it words only using the left side of a split keyboard.
 The ultimate irony here is I'd love to take on some of these projects myself, but I can't effectively type anymore. Sad panda. After a few days of rest I'm able to test new keyboard, I got excited for a few hours, and then spend the rest of the day watching the pain in my right forearm intensify. I'm hoping to get up to some base level of functionality using existing tools that I can use the bootstrap my own development.
 Anyway, if there's anything you know of or directions you can put me in I greatly appreciate it.
 (if my current depression is coming through this post please excuse me, chronic pain is just a bitch and AA so when you can't do any of the things that you would normally do to take your mind off it. I guess I should be happy voice control works on this iPad at all, I just wish it was better and hooked up to a local LLM. Peace)

 Stan is a static analysis tool for Haskell. Its maintainers seem to have stopped supporting it after the GHC 8.x series because the GHC API changed too frequently for them to want to keep making adjustments.
 Last year I did quite a lot of work to bring Stan and its dependencies up to 9.4. I made a PR to the Stan Github repo last month:
 https://github.com/kowainik/stan/pull/506
 I haven’t heard anything from the maintainers.
 The only maintainer I know of is Veronika Romashkina. I’ve sent her a private email about this but had no response. Does anyone know how I can get in contact with Veronika or another Stan maintainer, if there is one?
 I would be willing to be a comaintainer for Stan and the rest of the Kowainik ecosystem (if only to make sure they continue to work with future GHCs).

Normally placing point behind ellipsis and then hitting return would just place point at the beginning of the line below the headline (while it stays collapsed).
 Now point is stuck behind the ellipsis! Why?!
 Removed my complete config to test emacs out of the box and the problem ist still there and googled around but could not find anything about this problem.
 Is this a bug or something new that I don't understand?
 Would be very thankful if somebody could tell me something about this.
 Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently exploring the integration of Azure services with Haskell for a production project. I've previously used `Amazonka`, the Haskell library for interacting with AWS services, and found it quite useful. The main services used are EC2, S3, Secrets Manager, SES (via Amazonka).
 I'm trying to port the above (working) Haskell-based backend to work in Azure.
 I'm curious if anyone has experience using Haskell to work with Azure services in a production (or test) environment. Specifically, I'm interested in hearing about:
  
Your experiences or challenges faced while integrating Azure services with Haskell
 Recommendations on Haskell libraries or tools that you found effective for interacting with Azure services, similar to how Amazonka is used for AWS.
  
Thanks in advance for your input! 😊

Let's say I just read a passage on how to make a cake and create a number of highlights and comments. Now is the title "how to make a cake" a core idea? Or should I go into more detailed title like which flour should I buy or how do I use the oven? If I need to go to the detailed titles, does it mean I need to create a separate note for each title?

This theme has been discussed previously, but I'm approaching it from the perspective of knowledge work and research. What are your personal views on AI, specifically ChatGPT and related models, in relation to how we engage with knowledge and conduct research?
Recently, I had the opportunity to work with ChatGPT-4. I've been inputting numerous academic papers for analysis and summarization. From my perspective, this is one of its most valuable applications. I'm exploring worlds of CFS and Fibromyalgia, and as someone who isn't currently in academia (though I have past experience), ChatGPT has empowered me to undertake my own research. I believe I can do so reliably, evaluating various sources to draw practical, science-based conclusions. It has also allowed me to simplify complex topics by explaining concepts in clear, jargon-free language.
A couple of additional questions: Are there any drawbacks to this approach? How do you engage with these models, if at all?]]></summary>

 Doom modules v23.09.0-pre HEAD -> master 844a82c4 2023-09-22 23:18:31 +0200
 Issue:
 This whole setup was working wonderfully till about 2 weeks ago when I am not if I modified something by mistake or if it was because I ran doom upgrade.
 Now every time I try to call the function, I get : Error running timer ‘org-reveal’: (error "‘org-element-at-point’ cannot be used in non-Org buffer #<buffer \*doom\*> (+doom-dashboard-mode)") [19 times]
 I have nuked my doom directory and reinstalled, yet I still get the same error. I furthermore tried starting emacs with "emacs -Q" and then inserting ":org-mode" but that also gives me the same error. What am I missing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of my ongoing quest to incorporate functionality from Excel-like programs into Org tables, I made company-org-table, a completion backend for Org table cells that mimics the auto-complete behavior of spreadsheet programs like Excel, LibreOffice, and Google Sheets: 
 https://github.com/shankar2k/company-org-table
 By default, the completion candidates are the contents of other cells in the same table column, but company-org-table can also be configured to dynamically generate candidates based on the table name and column header.
 The animation below illustrates company-org-table in action:
 Auto-completion in an Org table using company-org-table. Completion candidates in the first two columns are predefined lists, but in the second two columns are other table cells in the same column.
 I hope some of you find this useful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! So, part of my bachelor’s thesis is basically running a CNN over some images that can hold letters, numbers, and a couple of logic symbols. This being my first time ever handling an ML task, I wanted to go safe with pytorch.
 The thing is, I’m having a couple of type issues with the library, and I don’t really understand much about what the functions should get as input, or what they return… So, I thought that maybe a more statically typed programming language might help, hopefully, my favorite one :).
 I’m looking for library recommendations that:
  
Allows me to write a simple CNN at first (like LeNET) and then maybe jump into other architectures (AlexNet maybe?)
 
Can run on an AMD Radeon GPU
 
Runs on windows? (not mandatory, but desirable since my it’s my tutors OS)
 
 Thanks in advanced

Since im an advanced genius, my project uses java preview features. LSP correctly sets this up (due to it being specified in my pom.xml, I assume).
 When I try to start the debug using M-x dap-java-debug however, it wont run due to the missing --enable-preview-features flag.
 So i wrote a custom debug template that should fix this - only problem is, since I have already picked a debug template the first time I launched the debugger, I can't figure out how to now switch to my new template. If it matters: im using doom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. It's been a long time coming, but I recently released Orgro 1.33.3 with simple editing support.
 At the moment you can:
  
Toggle list item checkboxes
 Cycle the TODO status on headlines
 Undo/redo changes
 Auto-save the edited document back to the original file, or if permissions don't allow, then you will be prompted to share or discard the document
  
I've added lots of other improvements as well; see the changelog for details.
 I'm still thinking about other kinds of editing operations and how they can be exposed comfortably in a mobile UI (especially one that tries to mimic the "native" appearance of an Org Mode doc in Emacs). If you have ideas, suggestions, or other feedback, please feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.
 A final thing to mention is that I'm still a bit worried about Orgro making unwanted changes to files when saving them. I tried hard to be able to write files back verbatim (modulo edits), but if you notice any incidental changes then please report them.

Now that the foundations are laid out, we decided to publish our work-in-progress specification. However, much remains to be done. In the coming months, we will integrate the missing pieces we mentioned at the beginning of this post.
 In the meantime, this specification can already serve as a reference for many core aspects of Scala 3.

 I've just installed GHC 9.6.2 with `stack --resolver nightly-2023-09-26`.
 Previously, the GHC docs were installed along with GHC, but this doesn't seem the case anymore: I can't find the "users_guide" docs anywhere on my disk now. I did find the docs for the libraries and also for base, but the users guide seems to be absent.
 Has it not been packaged with the new GHC version, or am I missing a setting for stack? :)
 Could I download the docs separately from somewhere else? I can only find an online version and don't want to use some kind of crawler.
 Regards,
 Hai

 Unfortunately, I cannot use emacs-jupyter because I am working on an assignment that uses animations. I tried ein but it does not produce animations. I am using Firenvim + neovim right now and while very useful I have issues with the editor size and position in the browser page. 
 I think that the best thing would be to have Emacs keybindings in the text areas. Is there any way to setup this in a reliable way? Some of the shortcuts are reserved by Firefox, such as Ctrl-a, Ctrl-e, Ctrl-f etc.
 I am using Sway, so emacs-everywhere does not work.
 Thank you for any suggestion or pointers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use dependent types to make my code more typesafe and concise, while also being able to express precise invariants for it. One problem, though, is that I want, at some point, to read a list, which was previously saved to a files, that has it's type parameterized to a Dependent Sum. The following example closely resembles code I'm writing at the moment (as this is an example, I don't know if all pragmas need to compile the following are included in here. Please shout me out if corrections are needed):
 {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-} import Data.Kind (Type) import Numeric.Natural (Natural) type Alt :: FooType -> a -> b type family Alt a b where Alt 'Foo1 a = a Alt 'Foo2 a = () data FooType = Foo1 | Foo2 deriving (Show, Read) data SFooType :: FooType -> Type where SFoo1 :: SFooType 'Foo1 SFoo2 :: SFooType 'Foo2 data Bar :: FooType -> Type where Bar :: forall (s :: FooType). {a :: Alt s Integer, b :: Alt s Natural} -> Bar s deriving instance Show (Bar 'Foo1) deriving instance Show (Bar 'Foo2) deriving instance Read (Bar 'Foo1) deriving instance Read (Bar 'Foo2) data SomeBar :: Type where SomeBar :: forall (s :: FooType). SFooType s -> Bar s -> SomeBar instance Show SomeBar where show (SomeBar s b) = case s of SFoo1 -> show @(Bar 'Foo1) b SFoo2 -> show @(Bar 'Foo2) b 
 As you can see, I could figure out how to write show instances for a dependent sum. Read instances, though, are not as straight forward. I've tried, without success, to write an instance for it on my own.
 Now I want to hear from you. Am I approaching this from the wrong angle? If not, what would you suggest I do to make this possible?
 Thanks in advance, guys.

 I recently came across The Guardian newspaper's style guide checker, and thought something similar could be really useful to me in my work. The code for the project is open source on Github, so in theory it should be doable. However, apparently most of it is in Scala, and my programming experience is already very limited to basically only some beginner Python.
 How doable would it be to use The Guardian's code as a base to create something similar myself, given this background? I'm willing to invest time and learning into it, but just wanted to ascertain the scale of the undertaking before committing to that.
 I'd appreciate any opinions or advice on this. Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using centaur emacs which has dump-jump by default.
 I tried dump-jump on simple "hello world" and other cpp project and it doesn't work. Definition is not found. 
 I tried on pop-os(emacs 29) and ubuntu(emacs 27). 
 ripgrep is installed on the PC.
 I tried to force it to be used with (setq dumb-jump-force-searcher 'rg) and (setq dumb-jump-prefer-searcher 'rg) 
 I added (add-hook 'xref-backend-functions #'dumb-jump-xref-activate) to use M-. 
 Also, put a .projectile and .dumbjump 
 I saw nothing with set-variable dumb-jump-debug t 
 I was expected it work easily because the search is with ripgrep only. 
 What could be wrong ?

Recently I find there is a few seconds stuck to show point of cursor in new frame when switch between frames, for example 2~3 seconds, so I will wait a few seconds after switch frames by "Alt + Tab". Sometimes it feels bothered. Any clue to debug or tune this stuck? Thanks

 I'm currently using org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files to export the TODOs from all my agenda files. I don't want to reschedule the TODOs to today, as many of them are recurring items and I don't want the next repeat time to be based on today when I do mark them as DONE.

 (global-set-key (kbd "C-.") 'scroll-up-line)
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-,") 'scroll-down-line)
 C-. and C-, feel pretty natural, and they aren't bound by default. scroll-up-line and scroll-down-line aren't bound by default either, and they're nice cause they move the screen up or down a line instead of an entire page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't think my title explains this well. Basically, what I mean is that, as also the case with jupyter notebooks, if I am doing an analysis and I run a cell which updates a variable itself in a self-referential way, without forgetting to run the cell where it was initialized, I get the wrong output. Is there a way to make sure one if I run an src block that depends on another src block, that the dependent src block will run before the one that I am currently running. I realize, I would need to manually tie these together. I feel like something could be done w/ the preamble attribute and writing an elisp function that just runs another src block, but I don't know how that elisp function would look. As an MWE, I imagine the functionality kind of looking like...
 #+name: initialize #+begin_src python x = 5 #+end_src #+begin_src python :preamble (call_src "initialize") x+=1 #+end_src 
 I tried...
 (defun call_src (name) (org-babel-goto-named-src-block name) (org-babel-execute-src-block)) 
 but it seemed not to load the variables before running the cell (possibly because I am using Jupyter-Emacs w/ asynchronous src blocks). 
 Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

For email I use Apple's Mail app and a slip of a finger earlier today just revealed to me that for some reason basic Emacs keybindings are working when composing a message. C-n, C-p, C-a, C-e, C-f, C-b etc. 
 I have absolutely no clue why this should be the case, what I may have installed and forgot about, or how to go about finding out what's going on. I assume there is an embarrassing and simple explanation that is hiding in plain sight? Thanks in advance for the pointers!

 I am newcomer to both Emacs and C++ so please be patient. I am trying to set up eglot + clangd. I have this in my config:
 (require 'eglot)
 (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '((c++-mode c-mode) "clangd"))
 (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
 (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
 and I have followed the instructions at https://clangd.llvm.org/installation and have version 12.0.1-19ubuntu3 of clangd installed.
 The project I am working on right now is compiled using CMake so I have also created "compile_commands.json" succesfully using cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 which should be loaded correctly as the *Eglot stderr* buffer gives me "Loaded compilation database from ...."
 However, several definitions using xref are not working, I just get "No definitions found for: LSP identifier at point", and when I try to eglot-rename a variable I get "jsonrpc-error: "request id=85 failed:", (jsonrpc-error-code . -32001), (jsonrpc-error-message . "Cannot rename symbol: there is no symbol at the given location"), (jsonrpc-error-data)". 
 Can somebody guide me in how to properly set up eglot + clangd or help me figuring out what is wrong?
 Thanks a bunch!

Now I have a problem with the header line: the line is far longer than what my screen allows to display, and I do not want the line to be continued as a second visual line, since it makes the align function useless.
 Instead I want to have to scroll right, in order to see the fields on the right.
 I guess I have to play with a kind of ~fill-column~ or ~auto-fill-mode~ but I do not understand the many finesses of these options.
 is there any visual post (with Screenshots and examples) explaining how to set this right?

 I'm currently working on customizing my org-mode setup, and I've run into a little snag with Treemacs. I would like to have Treemacs display the #+title:property of my org files instead of the file name in the directory tree.
 I've scoured the documentation and tried various configurations, but I haven't been able to achieve this. Has anyone successfully done this before or has any ideas on how to accomplish it?
 Here's an example of what I mean:
 org code:
 #+TITLE: Project XYZ * My Awesome Project ** Task 1 ** Task 2 
 In Treemacs, instead of seeing "My_Project.org," I would like it to display "Project XYZ" for that entry.
 The reason that i ask for this is that i am using OrgRoam and the file names start with a pretty large id.
 Any guidance, tips, or even pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

 My intention for this thread is as a sort of knowledge-sharing. I know for me, I wished I had discovered the above a lot earlier.

From this, it is transferred to their journal, where everything appears more systematic, and finally to a ledger, in double entry after the Italian manner of bookkeeping, where one settles accounts with each man, once as debtor and then as creditor. This deserves to be imitated by scholars. First it should be entered in a book in which I record everything as I see it or as it is given to me in my thoughts; then it may be entered in another book in which the material is more separated and ordered, and the ledger might then contain, in an ordered expression, the connection sand explanations of the material that flow from it.…]]></summary>

This is part of a package I'm writing, so I'm talking about doing this programmatically, in code. My instinct is to use forward-line inside a call to with-current-buffer. My code didn't work and I've isolated the problem -- my call to `forward-line' doesn't do anything. I've tested outside the program and the same thing happens. Try the following code in a buffer other than scratch:
 (with-current-buffer "*scratch*" (forward-line)) 
 It should switch temporarily to scratch, call forward-line and switch back. It doesn't do anything on my machine, even with emacs -q (no personal config file).
 I'm on 30.0.50.

 Has anyone published a list of flags for Scala 3? (Scala 3.3).
 Last time I used Scala 3 (3.0), a lot of options were missing. Has Scala 3.3 bridge the gap?
 I'm planning to try to upgrade one of our projects at work but looking for feedbacks on this before. A lot of these flags are mandatory to get the full power/safety of Scala IMHO.

 I spent few hours checking the job market for Scala jobs in Data Engineering (I'm a Data Engineer). But daaaaaaamn I really thought Scala/Spark was way more a thing! It's really all PySpark now. What a disappointment 😢 Especially with Scala 3, honestly any data engineer who knows Python could easily write Spark job in Scala. 
 Hard to find the motivation to keep learning FP in Scala when the Scala opportunities are so limited. I guess it will teach me FP so that's good. But there's a depressing vibe to it.
 I guess only very big tech companies or banks or companies still relying on a on-premise infra may still use Scala.

It turns out to be quite complicated, so i decided that i would rather invest that time and effort in something like emacs. I tried doom for a few days, but i couldn't get anything near the experience i had in Vim. i couldn't even enable syntax highlighting for the different programming languages i use, so i would like to ask for any helpful resources about how to configure emacs as an IDE, videos, articles, books, well documented configs would be helpful Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if it's possible to use dir-locals, projectile, or some other scheme in order to map major modes to certain file types conditionally. Specifically, when working on static site generator projects, I routinely need markdown files to not only use web-mode (which I wouldn't normally use for markdown), but I need web-mode to set its templating language to something specific. I'm not quite sure how to do this. With dir-locals, I'm afraid modifying the auto-mode-alist would leave it in a bad state if and when I move onto a different repo. Meanwhile, projectile doesn't seem to have a clean way to hook into changing project types (unless you do it manually). Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago my package llm was added to GNU ELPA. This package isn't for end-users, it's for others who are writing llm-based functionality to do so in a way that is agnostic of the llm backend. That way the user can use the LLM they have access to. LLMs are "large language models", very large systems that are able to deal with natural language with surprising naturalness.
 To start, we provide functionality for creating embeddings, and for LLM chat, in both sync and async versions. There are only two providers to start with: Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex. There's obviously more that are possible, such as Anthropic's API, or Llama 2.
 The difficulties with providing an interface to Llama 2, by the way, is that there seem to be a lot of different ways to install and use it, so it isn't clear that there's a good interface I could provide that would be widely useful. But it's pretty easy to write your own, and maybe I'll provide an interface that just goes to some command-line utility and executes it.
 If you are an author of a package that does something with LLMs, I'd encourage you to use this package, so your users can have some control of what backend they are using. And if you want to help expand the number of LLMs we have access to, please send a pull request if you have FSF papers. This is a GNU project, so FSF papers are required for substantial contributions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MisTTY is a major mode for Emacs 29.1 and up that runs a shell inside of a buffer. It is built on top of term.el. It is available on MELPA. Check out its project page at https://github.com/szermatt/mistty.
 Such a buffer feels very much like comint mode: you can move around freely and run any Emacs command you want - until you press TAB and end up with the native completion or notice the shell autosuggestions. With MisTTY you have access to both Emacs and the shell commands and editing tools.
 Additionally, commands that take over the entire screen, such as less or vi also work, temporarily taking over the window, while scrollback remains available in another buffer.
 MisTTY works well with Bash and ZSH, but it is especially well suited to running the Fish shell; you get autosuggestions, and completions in full colors.

 I'm new to Haskell and this subreddit. I was reading Learn You a Haskell and stumbled across this operator -: here, 
  
Haskell ghci> landLeft 2 (landRight 1 (landLeft 1 (0,0))) (3,1)  When we apply the function landLeft 1 to (0,0) we get (1,0). Then, we land a bird on the right side, resulting in (1,1). Finally two birds land on the left side, resulting in (3,1). We apply a function to something by first writing the function and then writing its parameter, but here it would be better if the pole went first and then the landing function. If we make a function like this: haskell x -: f = f x  We can apply functions by first writing the parameter and then the function: haskell ghci> 100 -: (*3) 300 ghci> True -: not False ghci> (0,0) -: landLeft 2 (2,0)  By using this, we can repeatedly land birds on the pole in a more readable manner: haskell ghci> (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 1 -: landLeft 2 (3,1) 
  
according to my expert research at this point in time there was no pipe operator in Haskell, so I looked up and found this page.
 here two operators are mentioned -: and :-, used together, could allow us also use expression in infix notation, instead of just functions.
 I checked in ghci and there are no such operators available. are these old operators that were removed? what's their story?

Dark them with black background

 Fairly high contrast, but with a subtle colour palette
  
I find a lot of dark themes are either low contrast, or the colour palette is mainly based on simple bright primary colours which I personally dislike.
 Anyone use a theme that sounds like it might fit the bill?

 I was using GHC and a Makefile to compile and run and making a new file for every "day". Eventually I wanted to use splitOn so I made a cabal project. Then I found out it automatically loads your modules into the repl with cabal repl which is sick. 
 Unfortunately I'm trying to work in modules/day3.hs and import rund3 to Main.hs and run it. However Cabal can't see my non exported functions inside modules/day3.hs. this is a bit unfortunate.
 Solution I can think of is working inside Main then transferring to a different file when I'm done but maybe there's a totally different set up that works better?

 I have a Java and Python background.
 I used Scala before to develop Spark jobs. That being said I haven't dug too deep into the FP aspects of Scala.
 I'm planning to learn more in-depth about FP in Scala.
 After I understand the FP basics, would you recommend I dive into cats or perhaps it's advisable to have some experience with "native" Scala first before digging into Cats or ZIO?
 I have no clue how overwhelming those libraries can be for a developer with very limited experience with FP. 
 Thanks again!

 It uses a PPX macro which reads the raw SQL string before compilation and asks Postgres server for the data type which will be returned when the SQL would actually be executed. This way OCaml knows the return type of each SQL query even if they are just pure SQL.
 Is there anything similar for Scala? I searched quickly for Scala SQL libraries but they don't seem to provide both raw SQL usage and high type safety.

 About 75% of my configuration was plain sailing. Most of the remaining 25% is related to completions. 
 One massive problem I have is the *completions* minibuffer. I hate it. 
 I don't want a minibuffer for completions. I'm trying to bend company to my needs. But the *completions* minibuffer pops up anyway. And when it does, it is very intrusive. It changes the layout of my frames. And when I make it go away, the buffer that I'm working in is repositioned. 
 At the moment, it is the bane of my workflow. I'm working on a complex set of problems that require a lot of focus. And having my frames re-arranged unpredictably messes with my head. 
 My understanding is that the *completions* minifbuffer can't be removed. Is there a way to prevent it from being invoked?

I clicked it, and I got a comment -*- lexical-binding: t; -*- at the top of my file, and it said it enabled lexical binding.
 What are these special comments? It seems suspiciously similar to the above that I mentioned in seeing someone's init file (whose style I copied) and it has an actual effect (when removed, the Elisp/d comes back instead of Elisp/l). Is there docs on these?
 Stylistically, these make me recall the sh shebangs, like #!/bin/sh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a long writing piece which I'd like to organize and edit in Emacs, but large swathes of it have already been written in LibreOffice Writer. There are plenty of italics and bolded keywords throughout the text and I can't find an easy, pre-existing way to preserve them in Org mode markup.
 So far it seems the easiest means of automating this would be to dump the clipboard contents to an HTML file or other suitable in between and then write a script to process it into Org mode markup, but that seems ludicrous. I'd use Bash because that's what I know—I can't find a preexisting solution in Emacs elisp. There is a very, very old .odt importer called odt2org and it requires a now obsolete version of Python which I'd like to avoid setting up. 
 Literally copy/yanking the text from Writer into a text-file, and manually copying the italics would be faster. Am I missing something? I see lots about exporting from Emacs, but what about preserving formatting into Emacs? If there's a means which includes formatting headers, block quotes into #+begin_quote/#+end_quote tags etc, that'd be perfect but I'll settle for just italics and bold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am writing a big calculator. This calculator has many, many inputs and many, many outputs. My fundamental type is a Partner. Conceptually it makes sense to associate both inputs and outputs with a Partner. Also, some of the outputs are both important on their own and as inputs to later parts of the calculation.
 My question is: how do I architect this in Haskell? I can imagine having a big Partner record type that has a field for each input and each output. The downside of this is I'd have to initialize it with empty values for all the outputs. Would I then make those a Maybe type? That might get annoying.
 Do I instead define a separate type for each new output as it's calculated? Say we start with just a PartnerInput object that only holds the inputs. Then we calculate the first output and put the result in a PartnerInputAndFirstOutput object. I.e. the first function has type PartnerInput -> PartnerInputAndFirstOutput. Then the next function has type PartnerInputAndFirstOutput -> PartnerInputAndSecondOutput, and so on. Intuitively this feels silly.
 Like any good Haskeller I want to use the type system to help guarantee the correctness of my code, but I can't figure out how in this case. I'm interested to hear your thoughts.

 After much documentation reading and searching I ended up using C-u 49 C-f to move the cursor 49 days forward. How clever! 🤓
 Similarly, we can also use: - C-n, forward week - M-}, forward month - C-x ], forward year

 IWindow is an interactive window choosing and switching package, similar to Ace Window. Why not Ace Window? Because I use EXWM, and Ace Window's window highlighting (which uses Avy) doesn't work with EXWM buffers. I needed something more customizable, and IWindow was borned. By default it uses mode line to show window selection keys.

 With this, I can write in org mode...
 #+caption: Lorem impsum dolor #+attr_latex: :options \centering #+begin_figure [[subfig:example-image-a][Caption of A >(width=0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-b][Caption of B >(width=0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-c][Caption of C >(width=0.6\textwidth)]] #+end_figure 
 and have it transcoded to latex like...
 \begin{figure} \centering \subcaptionbox{Caption of A}{\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{example-image-a}} \quad \subcaptionbox{Caption of B}{\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{example-image-b}} \subcaptionbox{Caption of C}{\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{example-image-c}} \quad \end{figure} 
 I am wondering if it is possible to automatically automatically wrap consecutive subfigures in a centered figure environment, and add the space separator between them, ie. I want to be able to write just...
 [[subfig:example-image-a][Caption of A >(width=0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-b][Caption of B >(width=0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-c][Caption of C >(width=0.6\textwidth)]] 
 and have it transcode the same way as it does above.

 Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

Emacs 28.2 gave me a ton of warnings about the packages I was using (managed with straight.el). I thought that was weird, so I built Emacs 29.1. All the warnings disappeared after that!
 I'm not an experienced user, so I wanted to ask here why some versions of Emacs seem to dislike my init.el and other versions are fine with it. Is there a way to avoid this in the future?

 ​
 Is there any way to publish a .org file to HTML but showing the record of time invested in an activity?
 Today I use .org files for tracktime in my projects. And I publish them in HTML for my clients to access. But in some cases the "Clock table" is not enough because it summarizes everything and I cannot highlight the time invested in specific tasks by highlighting the days I worked.
 To get around this I am using two sections of "Clock Tables", one summarizing everything and in the second section several "clock tables", one per day (as shown in the print). But this format has proven confusing for some of my clients.
 I would like the daily log to appear in the HTML, the simple format of :logbook: would be interesting, but whenever I export it it is hidden.
 Thank you very much in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found this interesting concept on Howard Abrams' web page:
 https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/new-window-manager.html
 TLDR: he launches Emacs in fullscreen with xinitrc, but without EXWM. He uses xterm to start other applications such as firefox.
 I use Emacs with Sway, but I was wondering if anybody here is using Emacs as a window manager without EXWM or in some deeper synergy with some other minimal window manager. I have used EXWM and I already know what are the good and what are the bad parts. So I am interested in alternative ways in which Emacs can be used as a window manager.
 Another cool concept is here: http://perma-curious.eu/repo-ewx/
 Another window manager that could integrate well with Emacs, and perhaps even re-create the EXWM experience by writing some glue code in Elisp, could be river: https://github.com/riverwm/river
 I am collecting ideas so please feel free to share how Emacs integrates or controls your window manager.
 Thank you.

 I thought of two possible solutions:
  
Use IORef to have a reference to the object. I do not really like the idea, because my object gets passed along a lot and having an IORef somehow destroys the beauty of it.
 Make a lazy infinit list of the widgets and then just append the next one on button clicked and this way force it to get created (need to keep track of the times clicked of course). I tried something like widgets <- sequen…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question is pretty niche. ;)
 I use lsp-mode with eldoc support enabled. When I move my cursor over something, a one line description of the signature (or whatever) appears in the minibuffer via eldoc. That's great.
 However when I jump to definitions via xref or avy, the eldoc message doesn't appear. As a workaround I move the cursor forward one character and back to get it to appear. 
 To fix the xref problems I added:
 (eldoc-add-command #'xref-find-definitions) (eldoc-add-command #'xref-go-back) 
 Now when I jump to or back via xref, the eldoc message appears right away.
 However I can't get it to work for avy-goto-word-1 and friends. I tried adding avy-goto-word-1, avy-goto-char and such to eldoc-message-commands via eldoc-add-command as above, but it didn't help.
 How can I get eldoc messages to immediately appear after using avy commands like avy-goto-char, avy-goto-word-1, etc?

 https://github.com/aripiprazole/rinha-de-compiler/blob/main/files/combination.json

 1) I tried Circe, but I keep hitting the inlining limit with the Function term. I tried increasing but it still persists.
 2) I tried uPickle but couldn't find a way to parse partially tagged records (program and location are not tagged, the rest of the structs are) 
 How would you solve that problem? Write it manually or there is another workaround?

 I discovered I can use desktop-change-dir to load a specific session that previously saved in your project directory by using desktop-save to create a .emacs.desktop in the directory that you choose. 
 I could read that it should work by starting emacs from the directory to load the .emacs.desktop in the directory where you launched emacs, but it doesn't work (Desktop-save-mode is set). 
 To have it loaded, I need to always use desktop-change-dir after to have started emacs.
 Also, I tried to add in configuration, but not work too : 
 (setq desktop-path '(".")) 
 Do you know a way to have it working ?

 I've been told that Macbooks can be a bit troublesome when it comes to some aspects of coding in general and that its almost always more convenient in Windows. For those who code in Haskell on Macs; are there actually any problems installing Haskell and if there are, can it be fixed easily?
 The reason I highlighted M1 and M2 is because people with Intel cores do not seem to have any problems with installing GHCup (from what I know).

I remember things like really testing if, for example, I had really written some code that calls on dynamodb to get an item was a bit of a PITA... Any ways to reduce the time to get feedback on whether your code is actually doing what you want it to do when working on the Cloud?
 I'm planning on using zio-aws (which seems to cover everything I need to use for now: Cognito, Dynamodb, Elastic Beanstalk, maybe Elastic Load Balancer), but I want to test whether I created my tables properly, if I'm adding and fetching items properly, etc. Is actually deploying the app and running it on the cloud the only way, or is there a way to run it locally and test the service implementations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 I'm new to emacs, getting used to it. I am trying to use emacs for my personal note writing, but also I'd like to use some of those notes as slides for a presentation with org-present. I want to customize how the presentation mode looks. Trying to follow someone else's work I figured I could create a function that changes the theme when launching org-present. When writing the notes, I use leuven theme (I selected it in customize-themes, and saved to use it by default). This is nice. Now, when I do org-present, my function is called. It just does:
 (defun my_slides () (load-theme 'some_theme)) 
 And effectively the background and most colors for text change, except for the headings. They are still in leuven theme. If I manually do customize-themes, then pick the theme I want to use, THEN, do org-present, then the headings appear in the theme I picked. So, what's the difference between load-theme and customize-themes-->pick one theme? How can I effectively change the theme to enter in org-present?
 Thanks in advance, any help appreciated.
 EDIT: Solved.
 u/Nawrbit's hint worked perfectly. In case it's useful for anyone now I have this in my init.el
 ;; Function to change default theme to the theme I want in presentation mode (defun start_slide () (unload-theme 'leuven) (load-theme 'material)) ;; Function to revert to my default theme when exiting presentation mode (defun exit_slide () (unload-theme 'material) (load-theme 'leuven)) ;; Call start_slide function when doing org-present (add-hook 'org-present-mode-hook 'start_slide) ;; Call exit_slide function when exiting org-present (add-hook 'org-present-mode-quit-hook 'exit_slide) 
 Thank you all for your suggestions!

 My first clue that something was wrong was seeing additional Fundamental mode buffers created with names that followed this pattern: *emacs* and *emacs:err*. The *emacs* buffer was trying to run something, but has a configuration issue as indicated by this message in the buffer:
 Lisp expression: Git variable `github.user' is unset. Set to: 
 and the *emacs:error* buffer contains no information, but is indicated as related to emacs stderr open in the output of counsel-buffer.
 I believe it has something to do with the async behavior, as I see the following when I examine the process table. Over time the number of extra processes continues to grow.
 ❯ ps auxwww | grep -i emacs | grep -v grep iain 15092 0.1 1.9 411753376 158400 ??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In writing a bit of haskell, I've come across this problem more than once. Consider the following example: 
 {-# LANGUAGE GADTSyntax #-} import Data.Kind (Type) data Foo :: Type where Bar1 :: {f :: String, g :: Integer} -> Foo Bar2 :: {f :: String, g :: Integer, h :: Double, l :: Double} -> Foo deriving (Eq) 
 ​
 Bar1 and Bar2 have a common "core" (f and g), but Bar2 extends on it by adding the fields h and l. In the way I see it, it makes functions that deal with Foo a little more of a hassle to write, since the fields f and h wouldn't be total for all values of Foo, making me resort to the Either and/or Maybe monads. 
 One way to avoid this would be turning Foo into a typeclass that abstract the common features of Bar1 and Bar2 and turning Bar1 and Bar2 themselves into types.
 The downside would be that I wouldn't be able to use pattern matching as easily and it would be harder to rely on the compiler to tell me when functions don't deal with all the possible values in the domain of Foo. Also, things that I could do to both constructors at once (like deriving an Ord instance for both of them) would be alot more verbose to do. And, if I decided to collect them in some sort of list, I would have to deal with heterogeneously typed lists.
 ​
 Anyway, maybe this is too much of a beginner question, but I'd like to hear from you possible ideas to solve this.

 This works fine with a 2 level headline view of the current file about 14 days into the month. At the beginning of the month, I need to switch back to the month before as well. Is there any way to give a headline view of the current and previous file, so I can scroll up/down this and go to the corresponding place in the file? Similar to what agenda-view can do with todos with follow-mode, but showing all headlines in a specific small set of org-mode files, ordered by their appearance in those files?

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread.
Ideas I'm thinking about:
The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis and Linguistic Relativity. Together, these ideas present the notion that language shapes experience. Maybe I have a warped understanding of this. This is obvious when considering self-talk. The language we use when we talk to ourselves dictates our moods, affect, actions, behaviors, and total experience. This is good news. Changing how we talk to ourselves and the stories we tell ourselves will change our experience—the role of methodeutic language or 'speculative rhetoric' as it steers cognitive understanding of the world.
I'm a judgment machine. Comparisons and self-criticism are sneaky and ubiquitous. I'm not talking about "I'm a failure." I'm talking about "Shouldn't I spend more time exercising, in the outdoors, walking, zettelkasting?" and other subtle ways I self-evaluate and am critical of my behavior.
Push above what I think is my "reading level" to achieve mastery by reading more books that present more profound ideas. If I want to understand bigger ideas, I must read books with greater ideas to grasp the deeper concepts essential for remarkable achievements. It's not enough to read a lot. To do extraordinary things, I must read books that stretch my mind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Reddit, is there a way to use the function (org-set-property) on special blocks, like a source block? I keep forgetting the correct argument and parameter names, and it would be useful for me to have a similar behaviour as (org-set-property) for this use case.
 My desired behaviour:
  
Set point in or at a source block (special block in general)
 Enter C-c C-x p (this maps to (org-set-property))
 Get a list of properties, select the property, RET
 Get a list of allowed parameters, select the correct one, RET
  
The property is now added to the special block, in this case the source block. 
 The current behaviour:
 In the current implementation of (org-set-property) a property is set to the header under which my source block is placed.
 Kind regards.

 I generally like to follow the XDG Base Directory Spec because I like to separate the code that configures the program (emacs) from any installed packages, language-servers, etc. 
 I have hacked together a solution to force emacs to use .cache/emacs/ where appropriate, but I'm wondering if that is worth the hassle. It seems like many packages want to default to using user-emacs-directory when they need to add files, which I agree is a sensible default, but I find it a bit cluttered when I want to edit my config.
 Curious what others think / do in their configs

 However when I run git, treesitter (mostly python and yaml, with some md) after a while I get an error about too many open pipes. 
 Also, if I compile it with aot native compilation it segfaults when I open any file under git, fine without native compiler.
 Is this a known issue? Is there a fix I need to do in mingw64?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in these days I came across "Thinking with Types" and the first part blew my mind. In particular, the Curry-Howard isomorphism really caught my interest, but I need help to know if I'm getting it correctly. What I've understood is that we can prove mathematical theorems through CH, for example to prove that a * 1 = a we just need to show that there is an isomorphism (hence, 2 functions that are one the inverse of the other) between (a, ()) and a. This gave me chills, so I wanted to try this way of reasoning with a theorem for natural numbers, but I'm stuck. In particular, I would like to prove that given two natural numbers m,n the GCD of m,n is the same as the GCD of (m mod n) and n. Again, here there is an equality so I think I would have to show there is an isomorphism between the two things. But I can't really imagine how to translate something like that in Haskell, and I'm not even sure if this is actually possible.
 P.S. As a side note, I also wanted to prove that there is no isomorphism between a set X and its power set, but imagining to prove that something doesn't exist with CH is even more complicated for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I currently use neovim as my IDE and note taking application along with mdbook. I use markdown for notes. Prior to this when I was on windows I used obsidian for that purpose. 
 I really liked the philosophy behind obsidian and bidirectional linking. However, ever since I started using Linux I feel the need of avoiding closed source applications. I've seen people use OrgMode and I believe I really like the extensibility. I also like the TODO/scheduling features of OrgMode and the Android app that syncs with it. For that I use calcurse atm. 
 I want to use Emacs solely for the purpose of using OrgRoam alone. That's it. I don't want to go down another rabbit hole of configuration and tinkering (the previous ones being neovim, sway, kitty and gnome in order of recency). I need vim keybinds, a decent syntax highlighting for orgmode, git version control and a dark low contrast colouscheme. I believe OrgMode can already do what markdown does and probably better, so no worries there. 
 What is the best plan of action for this? Thanks a lot for helping me out and I apologise if this sounds too stuck up/opinionated but I really cannot afford to go down that rabbit hole and I am looking for a (relatively) quick solution (preferably doable within a day). Once again, thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 The Problem:
 Emacs refuses to autoload the init.el file and apply the config therein.
 My Emacs Init File Contents:
 ```lisp ;; Load Init (load "/Users/d369/.emacs.d/init.el")
 ;; Load Theme (load-theme 'eNinja)
 ;; Encoding (set-language-environment "UTF-8")
 ;; Panel Padding (set-fringe-mode 12)
 ;; Font (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "MesloLGS NF" :height 150) 
 ;; Scroll Bar (scroll-bar-mode -1)
 ;; Make ESC quit prompts (global-set-key (kbd "<escape>") 'keyboard-escape-quit)
 ;; Require, Set, & Initialize Packages (require 'package)
 (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))
 (package-initialize) (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents))
 ;; Lexical Binding lexical-binding: t
 ;; Require Compat Package-Requires: ((emacs "27.1") (compat "29.1.4.2")) Code: (require 'compat)
 ;; Initialize use-package (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package) (package-install 'use-package)) ```
 The Error:
 Error loading autoloads: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory ~/.emacs.d/elpa/compat-29.1.4.2/compat-autoloads)
 Additional Info:
 The issue seems to be that there is no 'compat-autoloads' file to be found in the compat-29.1.4.2 directory, which is the latest version downloaded directly from elpa. I haven't been able to locate any information on this.

 Can we make it 400?
 Just today at work I did few small commits, then later on tweaked message from one commit, added few lines of code to the other. Searches to the log, see diffstats, patch contents and all... simple rebase there, small diff there... push to the upstream, all without sweat. Magit makes work feel like play.

 I don't know why it calls rustfmt with the "--edition 2021" arguments.
 The command rustic-format in rustic-mode runs just "rustfmt" with no issues.
 I already had rustfmt install via rustup.
 I wanted to switch from rustic-mode to rust-ts-mode but this is forcing me to stay with rustic-mode for now.
 Any suggestions?

 I would like to share the tree-sitter major-modes verilog-ts-mode and vhdl-ts-mode for FPGA & ASIC design and verification:
  
https://github.com/gmlarumbe/verilog-ts-mode/
 https://github.com/gmlarumbe/vhdl-ts-mode/
  
For the time being they provide the following features:
  
Syntax highlighting
 Indentation
 imenu
 which-func
 Navigation functions
 Beautify functions
 Basic completion at point
  
They are derived from verilog-mode and vhdl-mode respectively, making the switch simpler by having features like Verilog AUTOs or VHDL beautifying still available.
 Both are available on MELPA and MELPA Stable.
 Looking forward to receiving some feedback!

In my launch.json I set the debug binary in "program", but that doesn't seem to have an effect, I have tried with and without variables, using absolute and relative paths and nothing seems to work. So is there an emacs variable or something that I can set in my .dir-locals.el to point to the file so when I start debugging it finds the file automatically?
 ​
 This is how my launch.json looks like:
 { "type": "gdb", "request": "launch", "name": "Debug", "program": "PATH_TO_PROJECT_ROOT/target/debug/BINARY_NAME", "gdbpath": "rust-gdb", "args": [], "cwd": "PATH_TO_PROJECT_ROOT", "preRun": [], "postRun": [], "stopAtEntry": false, "serverStarted": "INFO" } 
 The all caps parts are substituting for the actual paths, but some folders include "-"s in them if that makes a difference

 I've been using Emacs for several years now. I've recently switched to emacs-lucid from emacs-gtk because it's supposed to be a bit more stable and because I don't want to use a Gtk app in my Qt-based environment. However, I have a minor but annoying issue with some GUI elements (namely, menus and tooltips) being blurry. They kinda look like they have been shrunk and then stretched again, if it makes any sense. Interestingly, this applies only to 1st level menus, 2nd level menus are always rendered properly.
 Is there anything I can do to fix this issue?
 Screenshot showing the issue: https://imgur.com/a/EDodgK1 You can see that the 1st level menu is blurry while the 2nd level menu is as crisp as potato chips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently reading the book written by Bird & Wadler and trying to solve some exercises about foldl, foldr, etc.. I ran into a problem 3.5.6 that I don't know how to solve. The problem is as follows:
 Given a list xs = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] of numbers, the sequence of successive maxima (ssm xs) is the longest subsequence [x_j_1 , x_j_2 , . . . , x_j_m] such that j_1 = 1 and x_j < x_j_k for j < j_k. For example, the sequence of successive maxima of [3, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 10, 7] is [3, 4, 9, 10]. Define ssm in terms of foldl.
 I wonder how to solve this? The authors in this chapter mention many identities with foldl, foldr, map (the three duality theorems about foldl and foldr are mentioned), but I don't know how to use it in solving this problem. Any help?

 I've found that all-the-icons is just a bit much (with support from all-the-icons-dired). I wanted consistent folder and file icons, but instead I got thousands, and while sometimes they make sense, other times, they don't. I tried using vscode-icons in conjunction with dired-sidebar and they were a bit too big (literally) and plain and non-subtle for me. I like the style of all-the-icons, but I want consistency (directories and files, one icon for each, and that's it). How can I make that happen?
 The regular "file" and "folder" icons would be ideal.

I found the only theme that respected the terminal's background opacity was the default one, except when using kitty, so I guess you're good if you're a kitty user.
 On a whim, I opened up the theme.el for the theme I'm using, and added a value in brackets at the beginning of the rgb value for the background, like setting the alpha value for urxvt's background in ~/.Xdefaults. Afterwards I noticed the value in the brackets didn't matter, and could actually be left empty, like so:
 "[]#000000"
 Different themes will have different names for the main background. Luckily it was labeled "bg-main" on mine.
 P.S.: You have to edit the system-wide theme.el. Changing the one in ~/.local didn't work for me. Also, emacs will use whatever transparency value you have set for your terminal (like I said, the value in the brackets above does not matter). And remember to restart the server for the changes to take place.

 After successfully compiling gcc w/ jit (didn't get any errors that were related to jit), I tried to configure emacs with --native-compilation which failed at the jit section.
 These pass:
 gcc_jit_context_acquire in -lgccjit... yes libgccjit.h usability... yes libgccjit.h presence... yes checking for libgccjit.h... yes 
 Then it fails when it tries to run the test program
 So when I run the libgccjit tutorial example myself, I get
 ld: cannot find crtbeginS.o: No such file or directory ld: cannot find -lgcc: No such file or directory ld: cannot find -lgcc\_s: No such file or directory libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver 
 I have tried to search for these errors and can't find anything. I also can find crtbegin in my gcc src, but it's not in the built.
 I used the default gcc7 that was already installed on the system, so maybe i need to recompile gcc-13 using gcc-11?

 The crtbeginS.o is located under install_dir/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/13.2.0 which install_dir/lib is appended to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH... so...

Things seem fine until I hit a semicolon, at which point the current line and the next line both get indented further than they should. Here's a before:
 public static class Stuff { public static T DoAThing<T>(T obj) { Console.WriteLine(obj) } } 
 And here's what happens when I hit semicolon: 
 public static class Stuff { public static T DoAThing<T>(T obj) { Console.WriteLine(obj); } } 
 Looking at the help for ;, I see that it's bound to c-electric-semi&comma, and if eglot isn't running, setting c-syntactic-indentation to nil does what I would expect, but when I turn on eglot, the indentation goes wrong. Am I missing something?

 In a previous post, I announced the first draft of a proposal for a community-owned cryptography project, and asked for feedback, of which I received plenty. I'd like to thank everyone that has given their thoughts so far, and the proposal has been updated in turn to reflect that :)
  
Increased prominence of deliverable items (esp unit tests) in proposal
 Performance benefit section has been added to Problem Statement
 Test vectors for algorithms (esp CAVP / FIPS / NIST) added to Optional Deliverables
  
Today I am happy to announce the final draft of the Botan / Cryptography Community Project Proposal. Barring any changes, I plan to officially submit the proposal to the Haskell Foundation on Monday, and I am now asking for any last feedback, opinions, thoughts, and criticisms that anyone might want to sneak in at the last moment.
  
Project update
 In addition to the proposal itself, we have the following updates to the libraries themselves as well:
  
Good progress has been made on Botan.Low.Cipher, which is now properly complete
 Unit tests for Botan.Low.Cipher
 Unit tests revealed that botan_cipher_output_length is inaccurate / flawed
 Corrected buffer estimate functions have been implemented to replace it
 Implemented offline / one-shot and online / incremental encryption
 Online encryption should be much more performant since you can stream the data instead of having to load it all at once
 Some cipher algorithms (SIV, CCM) are not online-capable, and their unit tests fail for the moment, but that is expected behavior (better organized unit tests will fix this)
  
 You can follow the project devlog on discourse!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: beOrg "sync"d with a workingfolder folder keeps around items from files that have been "removed", appears not to actually work from the data in the linked folder. (removed is in quotes because beOrg doesn't use filenames but file titles in the UI).
 More info/tests: (this may be a bug report, but hoping for a workaround)
 - Changing the /title/ of an org files results in massive dupes in the agenda. beOrg uses the title and not the filename, and it appears to screw with some local caching.
 - Unlinking the working folder doesn't change the data at all, so it's clearly operating from a separate cache. (and can't sync to remove files since you can't sync without a linked dir). So don't see a way to delete the old data and then just reparse the liked folder.
 - Can't just delete the file in question from beOrgs files (and then readd) since then it wants to remove it from the repo also. Using titles to operate on files is a really bad idea it appears.
 - Syncing doesn't seem to sync, it just adds. 
 - Since the issue is with the title and not filename I have no clue how to remove the old refs, since you can't delete the old file or anything.
 - I would anticipate similar problems with any reorg/refiling of items across files since it seems a totally non-destructive sync.
 ​
 So, does anyone have any ideas if there is a setting hidden somewhere? The next step would be uninstall/kill cache and see how it goes, but that's really no good since I like to be able to (re)organize my data. Just archiving seems like it would make beOrg break.
 Thanks for any tips or help. I'm so close to having my orgGenda on my phone.

I observe that the "XF86AudioLowerVolume" key in emacs -Q is recognized as "C-g," but in other applications, this key functions normally. I'm not using any external tools to map keys, so I suspect that Emacs is by default translating the "XF86AudioLowerVolume" key to "C-g". Is there any config option or compile option to disable this behavior? Any help on how to solve this or debug this would be very helpful. Thank you!

  data Flow (d :: FlowDirection) where InFlow :: Money -> Frequency -> DateRange -> Flow 'Positive OutFlow :: Money -> Frequency -> DateRange -> Flow 'Negative deriving Typeable 
 and I'm trying to construct a quasiquoter for a simple DSL to construct these, for which I need a Data instance (to be able to use liftData).
 The problem I get is basically that 'Positive (or 'Negative) don't match each other e.g. in gunfold, so I can neither derive the instance nor work out how to write one by hand.
 Is it possible to define a Data (Flow a) instance (or perhaps there's a way around the problem by not using liftData at all)?

This is the first time I encountered this type of file and wanted to know what it was so I searched google but couldn't find a good explanation. ChatGPT said it's a Emacs Lisp Dump (ELD) file, but I didn't get any search results on google with that either so I'm skeptical of ChatGPT's explanation.
 I'd like to know if there are any documentations on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have used emacs, mu4e, offlineimap, and smtpmail as my mail client for many years with my work's exchange/office365 email system.
 Recently, they made yet another change and now I'm struggling to authenticate smtpmail to send mail. I can successfully download mail with offlineimap, but not send. 
 I've used M365-imap on github to generate the refresh and access tokens to do oauth2 with the outlook servers. Previously, I could do a basic password to sent SMTP. Now, I need to use oauth2 with SMTP and use the access token generated by a python script in M365-imap. (I just put this token in my .authinfo file as the password for the server and specify oauth2 as the authentication method). Problem is, this access token only works once or twice before I have to regenerate it.
 The M365-imap page gives an example sendmail configuration where the passwordeval option is used to fetch a password from the output of the access token script. I need to do the same kind of thing in my authinfo configuration, but I don't see an equivalent option. Is this possible?

The Literal Example page doesn't seem to have anything useful since the literal must be inline. The blank looks fine with "low lines" (code point 0x5F) in the org document, but HTML collapses it down to one character. I can use other Unicode characters that are similar but not considered syntax, but is there an alternative method? Following is an example:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It used to work just right some time ago, I had Vertico and Consult, and find-file used to open a Vertico style vertical autocomplete. At one point (possibly after adding a lot of packages to my init), I noticed that every time I restart Emacs, it reverts back to ido-mode style autocomplete. I need to turn off ido-mode explicitly every time I start Emacs, to get back to Vertico style.
 I don't know when that started happening, so I can't pinpoint after which package that is. Init is a bit extensive so I will not post it here. 
 Off the tops of your heads, do you maybe know any familiar package that does this under the hood? I have not enabled ido-mode explicitly anywhere in my init. It must be some package that does it.
 Also, is there a package that can act as a debugger for emacs? So I can track the order of command executions and trace where ido-mode is enabled and in which package? Is there any better way to solve this short of disabling package-by-package?

The constraints also share many of the same types that are generated by long type functions. I would like to be able to define some type variables withing the synonym instead of having them be parameters and mucking up the function's type signature.
 Currently, I am using something like
 type ABC a b = (b ~ TypeFunc a, AnotherConstraint b) 
 but would much prefer
 type ABC a = forall b. (b ~ TypeFunc a, AnotherConstraint b) 
 Is there a way to accomplish this or a similar solution?
 so that b does not need to be defined in the external context.

This makes sense because I haven't given it any keys and have never done this email decryption thing. But where do I go, and what keys provide?

 So I thought a regexp search like \c6 should match digits. But it doesn't.
 [[:digit:]] as explained does work. Together with \sc which has no means to match digits this all confuses me anyhow as I am used to \d but well.
 What is the preferred way to match digits with Emacs regex syntax?
