 There's only two rules really to enforce via types:
  
Handlers can send events to themselves, or to a parent handler.
 Senders can only send events to the handler above them in the graph.
  
What I currently have looks like this:
 data Event a b = Parent a | Self b data Graph parentEvent event where Sender :: event -> [Graph parentEvent event] -- ^ children -> Graph parentEvent event Handler :: { handler :: newEvent -> [Event parentEvent newEvent] -- ^ receives the sender event and generates new events , children :: [Graph newEvent any] } -> Graph parentEvent newEvent Html :: String -> [Grap…]]></summary>

 First, emacs seems to litter my config folder with its own stuff. I want this folder to be backed up in my dotfiles repo, and I don't want extra stuff in it. Neovim for instance uses the config directory as "read only". It reads the configuration, and anything that it needs to save (like swap files, plugin data or even the plugins themselves) go into the .local/share/neovim directory. This is neat because it keeps the config tidy. Is there any way to make emacs do that?

 Main changes
  
more interactivity in the TUI interface
 fixes for darwin with ld override and ability to pass configure args to bindist
 many improvements to ghcup compile hls, hopefully making it a better alternative to bindists, see https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/guide/#hls
  
Breaking changes
 To improve installation safety, some changes have been made. Some buggy hadrian bindists are now unsupported. GHCup has fixed those bindists here: https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghcup/unofficial-bindists/ghc/curated/
 The fix is also upstreamed in newer versions of GHC.

 More things are general by default, and special cases don’t take up convenient names. E. g. fmap is called map, and Prelude’s map is just an instance, without special treatment.
 Strings are vectors of UTF-8 (= Text?).
 (Almost?) no lists. Vector as the default data structure + Foldable and Traversable for lazy sequential operations.
 foldl means foldl', and I’m not sure the lazy version belongs in a prelude at all.
 A point or a matrix can be made Num. Something closer to numeric-prelude instead of just Num.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following type representing formal linear combinations of the type b with coefficients in a:
 data FreeModule b a = MkFreeModule (Map b a) -- | A smart constructor that removes zero coefficients fromMap :: (Num a, Eq a) => Map b a -> FreeModule b a fromMap m = MkFreeModule (Map.filter (/= 0) m) toMap :: FreeModule b a -> Map b a toMap (MkFreeModule m) = m -- fromList, toList defined similarly, definitions omitted 
 A FreeModule admits an addition operation:
 add :: (Ord b, Num a, Eq a) => FreeModule b a -> FreeModule b a -> FreeModule b a add u v = fromMap $ Map.unionWith (+) (toMap u) (toMap v) 
 If b is a Monoid, we can also define a multiplication operation:
 mul :: (Ord b, Monoid b, Num a, Eq a) => FreeModule b a -> FreeModule b a -> FreeModule b a mul v1 v2 = fromList $ do (b1,a1) <- toList v1 (b2,a2) <- toList v2 pure (b1 <> b2, a1*a2) 
 Now, it would be very convenient to be able to use (+) for addition, and (*) for multiplication. So I want to do something like this:
 instance (Ord b, Num a, Eq a) => Num (FreeModule b a) where (+) = add (*) = if b is an instance of Monoid then mul else error "Can't multiply FreeModules since b is not a Monoid" 
 The last few lines are nonsense -- my question is whether it is possible to actually do something like this. The convenience of using (+) syntax is high enough that I am perfectly happy to have multiplication throw a runtime error when no Monoid instance is available. But it would also be nice to use mul when a Monoid instance is available.
 I guess the ideal situation would be if (+) and (*) were not methods in the same typeclass. Then I could have instance (Ord b, Num a, Eq a) => Add (FreeModule b a) ... and instance (Ord b, Monoid b, Num a, Eq a) => Mul (FreeModule b a) ..., but I don't want to go the route of defining my own numeric hierarchy.

I am using a qwerty US keyboard layout on a GNU linux machine, and I set up my compose key with setxkbmap -layout us -option compose:ralt. This works flawlessly almost everywhere, including when using Emacs from a terminal with emacs -q -nw. I can write words like "ĵaŭdo" ("thursday" in Esperanto), no problem at all.
 But when I try to input the compose sequence corresponding to one of those characters using Emacs in GUI mode with emacs -q, nothing happens. Clearly, Emacs GUI understands my compose key, as I can use it to write french characters like "déjà". Furthermore, it does not seem to be a character set issue: If I write "ĵaŭdo" in a text file, and open this file from Emacs GUI, it renders those characters just fine. Does anybody know what is going here? (emacs --version GNU Emacs 28.1`)

What kind of projects are made in Scala and why they couldn't be made in e.g Javascript? Or rather it isn't about language but tech field? From what I understand Scala is mostly used in processing big data, so knowing only Scala syntax won't help you with landing a job, right? So that leads me to another question: what should I learn in order to land a job in Scala ecosystem, besides language syntax, libraries etc ? I work in webdevelopment field and I'm trying to grasp what this language is about, so sorry if I ask dumb questions

 If I have tabs A, B and C open in that order, I want to open them again in that order after closing emacsclient. The tabs should also still open the same buffers that were open in them before. 
 My understanding is that desktop-mode can do this, but (desktop-save-mode) in my .emacs config only reloads buffers and doesn't open the last used buffer in the current window. 
 How do I save tab-bar-mode layout in emacs? 
 Edit: I should also specify I use emacs exclusively in terminal mode for a few reasons that would take too long to explain
 Edit 2: clarification 
 Edit 3: I found that it DOES work with GUI emacs, but not terminal emacs. Is there any workaround or plugin which will work?

 I usually build Emacs from source every so often, I tried today after pulling and got a strange issue during the make process.
 I'll spare you the super long macro unraveling but I got this issue: 
 Loading macroexp.elc... Internal native compiler error: "../../lisp/international/titdic-cnv.el", "failing to compile function", #<symbol titdic- convert at 16545>, "gcc_jit_context_new_call_through_ptr: not enough arguments to fn_ptr: freloc- >R6e6172726f772d746f2d726567696f6e_narrow_to_region_0 (got 2 args, expected 3)" 
 and several similar issues related to gcc_jit_context_new_call_through_ptr not receiving the proper number of arguments.
 This happened with:
  
Emacs pulled today (July 29th 2022)
 libgccjit 12.1.0-3 (on Manjaro Linux, installed with sudo pacman -S libgccjit)
 gcc 12.1.0-3 (on Manjaro Linux, installed with the package manager as well)
  
Since I'm not seeing posts everywhere of people failing to build from source, I expect this is an issue with libgccjit. 
 Can anyone replicate this behavior and has any tips to fix it?
 Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 Is it possible to have a web-based interactive overlay inside a text buffer in Emacs? 
 Something similar in UX to how images or org-transclusion overlays are displayed inside org-mode buffers. I am looking specifically for in-place rendering, not in a separate buffer. My use case is rendering html export blocks inside an org file to have an interactive notebook like experience, without exporting the whole document to html and viewing it in a browser. 
 This would allow one to use Emacs as a self-sufficient interactive environment, bringing interactive plots, boards, diagrams, graphs, tables etc. directly into already powerful text editing environment. This functionality exists a priori in web-based applications like Obsidian, VS Code (even with inline web-views), but those either become slower with each notebook cell, have json as a file format, or do not have serious text editing capabilities. I realize that such overlays are niceties, and one can always export and view the documents, but I believe that the described approach is alluring to many because it does not force one to split their thinking between creating and viewing.
 If there is no such package at the moment, I would be willing to implement it myself; however, I want to ask people who looked into Emacs rendering and text overlay capabilities if something of that sort is even possible. Or is it easier to rewrite Emacs GUI with something like Tauri? :)
 I am also happy to hear about other approaches or views on this problem which worked for you!

 Does anyone have a working configuration of Org-Caldav and Davmail that syncs both ways? Or have suggestions of what I am doing wrong?
 Note the Davmail is not on the standard port. But that is not the issue because the same port is working with Thunderbird. 
 I'll post the relevant section of my Emacs.org file below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! I'm currently using vim, but I was having some serious issues and wanted to know if Emacs could save the day. I use a non QWERTY keyboard layout (rsthd), and that makes using vim TERRIBLE, so like any normal person I changed my vim bindings to my layout. This caused a lot of issues regarding combos, and when I asked the vim community they said changing the default keymappings is a bad idea and I should just learn the default ones on my layout. I wanted to know how hard configuring Emacs is with a custom layout, maybe I should just switch sides.
 Tl;dr how does Emacs handle changing default keybindngs compared to vim?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question about splitting my configuration into multiple files, for vanilla Emacs, i.e., no Doom/Spacemacs/etc...
 I currently have my configuration by split theme which I then load using either (load "my-config.el") or (require 'my-config). This work well, but it crucially means that it is difficult to compile the configuration files (using the byte compiler or the automatic native compiler). This is because some of these config files have some dependencies on each other. In particular, all my config files assume that the load-path is set correctly and use-package and straight are installed and configured so that packages can be installed or used. When compiling files, especially using the asynchronous native compiler, these files are compiled in batch mode in a vanilla Emacs without any configurations. Hence any statements using unloaded packages would fail.
 What is the correct way to do this? I know I can put all my config in a single file (literate or otherwise) but I think this will get unwieldy quite quickly for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Right now I am developing a side project which is in production and has users(22350 lines of scala code). As I am the only developer I've decided to stick to the modular monolith approach. Is anyone has excepierence and can guide on how to achieve modularity? My current plan is to have such structure:
  
app/ => http api 
 bind everything together
 expose json rpc
 
 modules/foundation 
 expose persisting capabilities
 expose logging capabilities
 
 modules/coupon 
 can have depedency on other api
 can't have dependency on other non api modules
 implements interface in respective api
 can do persistence
 in general persist domain object defined in api
 unit tests
 integration tests
 can have dependency on foundation
 
 modules/coupon-api 
 no dependecies in general(can have depencies on other api or utility)
 expose interface
 expose domain object
 
 modules/foo
 modules/foo-api
 modules/bar
 modules/bar-api
  
The goal is to have strict boundaries between modules, exclude circular dependencies, define clear dependencies.
 How good is such structure from the local dev experience endpoint? (Are there any caveats with sbt+intellij that can make this unusable?)

 As an alternative, relative-style numbering respects text wrapping but fails with folds, so kinda makes this a weird place to be in XD. I've attached an example of a wrapped line where this fail can be seen in all it's glory.
 I would really appreciate any help with this, thanks!

 The features you didn't know you needed (Airbags, ABS) are in Haskell today, and you could take them to production today for the low-but-not-that-low price of taking some time to learn Haskell. You'll be safer, go faster (in many cases), and your codebases will be rock-solid.
 Not every organization can afford the cost, but for those that can that's great. Even if you can't, you can bring some of Haskell to your organization -- while Haskell is greater than the sum of it's parts, you can replicate some of it's great parts.
 If not, by this point you can get by with languages like Rust which give you the 80/20, Typescript as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, I am in the middle of reading the second edition of Functional Programming in Scala. I will probably have to also look at the first one, since the newer one is still being written.
 My question is what should I do after I have read this book. Should I look into Rock the JVM courses? If so, which ones? Should I read Functional Event-Driven Architecture by Gabriel Volpe? Or maybe older Practical FP in Scala? From what I can see, the older one uses Scala 2.13. Would it be a problem? Or maybe should I just try to start building my own stuff?

Whener I try to enter a character such as * (for a new headline), I receive the error message: funcall-interactively: Symbol’s value as variable is void: org-fold-core-style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 Can I ask for some help on this problem? I feel like I am close but I cant figure out what I am doing wrong. I am trying to create a function which will give me the subset of combinations which have cardinality (x:xs) - 1. For example, for a list [4,5,6] would give [[4,5],[4,6],[5,6]]
 To find all combinations, I have the 
 AllCombinations :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [[a]] AllCombinations [] = [[]] AllCombinations (x:xs) = AllCombinations xs ++ map (x:)(AllCombinations xs) 
 which will output all subsets. My issue is filtering. Basically, if I apply a filter of Length x == length xs I seem to be filtering out items I dont want. 
 AllCombinations :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [[a]] AllCombinations [] = [[]] AllCombinations (x:xs) = filter(\x -> length x == length xs )( AllCombinations xs ++ map (x:)(AllCombinations xs) ) -- NB length X == length xs is due to the tail being the same length as the entire list - 1 -- 
 Which in prelude we will get
 ​
 Line > AllCombinations [4,5,6] [[4,5]] 
 Instead of [4,5],[5,6],[4,6]. Can any explain why [4,5] ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GHC profiler is today one of the most advanced
profiling tools for analyzing how Haskell programs use CPU time and
memory. It produces information on what parts of a
program could use optimizations to speed it up.
Unfortunately, the very definition of the GHC profiler makes it of
limited use when estimating time on two
classes of computations: firstly, those that need to do blocking IO;
and secondly, some computations that invoke functions written in other
programming languages.
In these cases, one could just turn to a tool like
ghc-events-analyze, however, it is not available
to plugins loaded in GHC 8, such as Liquid Haskell.
In this post I’m discussing a bit the limitations of the GHC
profiler, and I’m announcing timestats, a simple

 These functions are built with completing-read so they play very nicely with ido, vertico, selectrum, consult etc. I haven't tried them with Helm or Ivy.
 Because they're interactive functions, it's trivial to add these as Embark actions. Specifically, I added them to the embark-identifier-map and embark-region-map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have these font definitions in my init.el:
 ;; Default (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Hack" :height 180) ;; Variable-pitch (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "Hack" :height 180) ;; Fixed-pitch (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "DejaVu Sans Mono") (defun custom/org-fixed-pitch () (set-face-attribute 'org-table nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'org-block nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch :foreground nil) (set-face-attribute 'org-code nil :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch))) 
 When Emacs starts with emacsclient -c the Hack font is not used. Probably the others font settings are ignored as well.
 Also, I noticed that my org agenda files don't load up when emacsclient -c is used. They don't show up in the buffers.
 I would be grateful for any suggestion.

It might have something to do with the size of the repository, I haven't checked. For example, when I invoke projectile-find-file in the nixpkgs repository (which is huge), nothing is shown, and I cannot even enter a filename to open it. In my own, smaller repositories, it's working fine. I'm using ido-mode, ido-everywhere and ido-ubiquitous-mode as well as ido-vertical-mode. Anyone else have this problem? It doesn't occur with projectile, just project.el. But I'd like to stick to emacs built-in stuff.

 I ponder binding my Meta key to the option key ⌥; it's currently bound to Cmd ⌘ so I have the ability to enter umlauts easily. (But given how little I need that in Emacs, since all my writing there is in English, I might as well switch and then have nicer key bindings.)

 Random scenarios that can be deployed...
 - jedis is smart enough to do this first?
 - you query for the master each time.
 - your admin team uses a client re-config that you count on working
 - pub/sub?
 Appreciate it.
 Edit: The reason i asked [IfYouUse] was for some best/decent/crappy practices currently out there. Clearly there are options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 Making an unsigned bit shift function with a type signature of Integer -> Integer -> a
 So I am implementing a function for another function(helper function some may say).The type signature for the function I am working with is:
 ​
 expToVariableInteger :: SomeMonad m => Expression -> (Integer->Integer->a) -> Expression -> (a->Value) -> m Variable 
 The function I am trying to implement is a unsigned bit shift.
 Similar to Javascript's >>> Where -1 >>> 30 will result in 3 
 So I have function that will do such an operation if I run on GHCI 
 ushiftR r l = ( r :: Word) `quot` (2 ^ l) 
 I am aware of the Data.Bits function 
 shiftR :: a -> Int -> a
 Where I could do something like
 ushiftR :: Integer -> Integer -> a ushiftR r l = shiftR l (fromIntegral r) 
 But I have (so many) issues.
 The 3 I am focusing on is:
  
Writing a function that actually works with a signature (I have tried so many things, but I cannot get anything to run, example ushiftR :: Num a => Integer -> Integer -> aushiftR r l = ( integerToWord r) `quot` (2 ^ l)
 Then once I have that, how could I get the function to be a ushiftR ::Integer->Integer->a 
 My other option is recreating expToVariableInteger :: SomeMonad m => Expression -> (Integer->Integer->a) -> Expression -> (a->Value) -> m Variable
 to myExpToVariableInteger :: SomeMonad m => Expression -> (Integer->Integer->Integer) -> Expression -> (a->Value) -> m Variable
 Now thinking about this outloud that might be the best bet. Thank you for those that read this far.
  
Wow my first post! I am excited! Sorry for the crackhead formatting. Sorry if this is inappropriate haskell noob rubish.

 When I first open a cpp file, I start up in lsp-mode with the server connected. Then when I open another file in the same project, there is no lsp-mode. Running M-x lsp doesn't work, and running M-x lsp-mode causes lsp-mode to say it's disconnected. Moreover, running M-x lsp-describe-session shows the current file to be under the clangd instance in the tree alongside the other file that is indeed working.
 I was wondering if anyone has seen that before or has any tips on how to debug it. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some reason, (after recently upgrading packages), running org-agenda via C-c a and then selecting a view from the dispatch buffer (such as a Agenda for current week or day) just shows me a buffer with the last file in my org-agenda-files list - in this case, an org file called work-notebook.org. 
 Looking at the buffer list, I can find the *Org Agenda* buffer listed and so can switch with C-x C-b, but is there any way I can restore the usual behavior -- i.e. the *Org Agenda* buffer opens in a window in my current frame?
 I usually have org-agenda-window-setup set at current-window, changing it to reorganize-frame still gives me the same problem.
 I'm running Emacs 27.2 using Org mode version 9.4.4.
 EDIT : thanks to /u/yantar92 for suggesting https://github.com/Malabarba/elisp-bug-hunter for a tool, which allowed me to find out the issue is with a recent update to org-gcal. The problem and a temporary fix are described in this github issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a three button mouse. With some programs you can hold the middle button (button 2) and move the mouse around to scroll (instead of using the mouse wheel). Is it possible to configure this in Emacs? I figure the answer is yes, because it's Emacs, but after a fair amount of searching I haven't found anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a cabal project that includes the following
 A TwoSum.hs file containing the following code (a simple two sum algorithm):
 {-# LANGUAGE TupleSections #-} import qualified Data.HashMap.Lazy as Map import qualified Data.Hashable as Hashable twoSum :: [Double] -> Double -> Maybe (Int, Int) twoSum list val = twoSumAlg list val 0 Map.empty twoSumAlg :: [Double] -> Double -> Int -> Map.HashMap Double Int -> Maybe (Int, Int) twoSumAlg [] _ _ _ = Nothing twoSumAlg (x : xs) val index map = if Map.member x map then result else twoSumAlg xs val (index + 1) newMap where foundIndex = Map.lookup x map result = (,index) <$> foundIndex newMap = Map.insert (val - x) index map 
 And a Main.hs file that calls this and prints the output.
 import TwoSum (twoSum) main = do print $ twoSum [4, 7, 2, 8] 12 
 This works perfectly and outputs Just (0, 3) when run with cabal run.
 The problem is that when I edit TwoSum.hs, VSCode doesn't give me any hints or Intellisense at all. If I move all the code into Main.hs, the Intellisense works fine.
 Is there a way to solve this issue?
 I'm pretty sure I've set up my project correctly, but here's my cabal file just in case
 cabal-version: 2.4 name: Project version: 0.1.0.0 executable Project main-is: Main.hs other-modules: TwoSum other-extensions: TupleSections build-depends: base ^>=4.14.3.0, unordered-containers ^>=0.2.19.1, hashable ^>=1.4.0.2 hs-source-dirs: app default-language: Haskell2010

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings and thank you all for being part of a knowledge-sharing community. I'm not sure exactly what I was doing a few weeks ago when  stumbled across a ZK article online. But I've been on a mission ever since to learn more and get my own implementation going. I have decided to use Obsidian, which is of course presents its own learning curve as well as the terrifying array of choices and customization options that come with it.
I am in my fifties and have been writing down notes on paper here, there, and and everywhere, for decades. But I never knew exactly what to do with all this material except for some occasional reviews, and when I found something of significant interest it might end up in a Word document, often along with other ideas that might have been somewhat related, and that would go into a subfolder somewhere, and soon it would be almost as hard to find as the original fleeting note was. I also have marginalia in almost every book I own, and I try to read a couple books a week, so there is a lot of that too.
Now that I see that the ZK method can rectify my poor organizational system, I am looking at my stacks of notebooks (and all those Word documents) and thinking.... wow, I should go through every last scrap and filter out the precious metals from the useless rocks, and get it all into my ZK. That will be a lot of time. Time that could be spent instead reading more books, which might provide a greater return on investment in terms of useful ideas and more polished knowledge that I can leverage.
I suppose the nominal approach is to set aside a certain amount of time every day to sift through the mound, knowing that eventually I can get it all accounted for.  It is at the heart of it an optimization question. But I am interested in reading about how others have dealt with the burden of getting a ton of unorganized and often useless notes into a new ZK.
Thanks for reading!]]></summary>

 I've been working with Scala for quite a while now and as someone who came from Java I liked Monix from the very beginning because of how much I worked with RxJava.
 So I'm just wondering how popular it is around here and what you like or don't like about it.

 Treemacs open the new file in the window where my PDF was. Every subsequent files open in the same wayt, i.e. takes up the window for my PDF. I would like it to use the main code window (window in the middle). Is there a way to do this? Thanks for any input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all!
 So, around 3 months ago I upgraded to emacs 29 and set up a "fresh" init.el; lots of copy/paste from my old config with an eye to using less "custom" features/keybindings and using "modern" tooling like embark and consult. I mostly develop in Elixir, so configured lsp with elixir-mode and found that xref-find-definitions triggered from the embark menu was working great and a real time saver.
 A couple of weeks ago, xref-find-definitions stopped working. I don't think I changed anything in my init.el, at least not related to lsp-mode or elixir-mode and definitely nothing related to xref. Now I always get No definitions found in the minibuffer whenever I call xref-find-definitions (either via C-. RET or M-.) even for items I know worked a few weeks ago. I've switched to using dump-jump in the meantime which is a great package but isn't as well integrated into embark.
 Can anyone point me in the right direction for diagnosing this issue?

 You can read the details in the readme, but even though it's still WIP, it already can:
 - autocomplete tags
 - insert links from selection
 - jump between notes
 - capture notes
 Give it a try please and let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll ask this question at a pretty high level, since it seems like an issue people might recognize, but if not, I can add more detail. I have (in the package monad-bayes), a type
 newtype Sampler a = Sampler (ReaderT GenIO IO a)
 which is used as a sampling monad. We wanted to generalize it to the following
 newtype Sampler g m a = Sampler (StatefulGen g m => ReaderT g m a)
 This version is parametrized by a choice of RNG and monad, which is great. Unfortunately, it's about 10x slower, at least when used as the sampling monad in a program that takes 1000000 random samples. 
 Does the typeclass constraint inside the newtype set off performance alarm bells for anyone? We tried inlining and specializing pragmas, but so far to no avail.
 Thanks!

 Is there a way to do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember seeing a while back (I believe in this subreddit) a thread on some starter projects for those learning… I know Python reasonably well and finally going to start to devote some time on learning Haskell and going through tutorials and books and getting grounded in some basics, but I find myself appreciating seeing things in action to really grasp the concepts. Any good repos or threads here would be much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I've recently moved from Cinnamon to i3wm and I am quite happy with this, except for Pycharm, that is quite terrible on the WM, so I am giving a try to emacs and I started with Doom. However, there is very little documentation on how to setup it in a way that it is comparable with Pycharm in usability, so I am wondering if you could point me in a direction on how to do that. Besides, there are some other problems that I am facing: - How do you setup and use python environments on emacs? I tried poetry, but it doesn't have anyway to inherit global site packages. There are many packages that I installed globally as I will always use them, so I don't want to keep reinstalling them in every environment. - I see nowhere a place to run and debug my python scripts and see the results. Also, after everything is setup will it be able to show graphs and images? - Treemacs always open in the .doom.d directory how can I make it open in my home directory?
 Thanks in advance.

 Edit: Maybe the question should be is there or will there be a limit imposed on the elisp languages' ability to improve EMACS?

I'm starting the book The Book of Form and Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki.
I'm working on the flow and rhythm of onboarding articles into my ZK. How the onboarding process flows is on a spectrum that is related to the complexity of the ideas captured from digesting the article. Some web articles are light containing only one or two sparkling ideas. Some books require weeks of additional research and reading to assimilate. Most artifacts of knowledge land between these two extremes. I'm working at the easier end of this spectrum.
Here are a few of the titles of zettel I've been working on last week.

However the feeds I set up in emacs aren't synced to miniflux, and I don't know if it is supposed to be like this or if there is something wrong with my setup.

 Emacs started up in an unusable state, with multiple errors.
 This brought my workflow to a grinding halt. I should really have a backup Textmind instance for such situations. (Maybe I do somewhere.)
 I googled how to downgrade the package in brew, but that appeared needlessly complicated. Brew did not have alternative versions of Emacs.
 Instead I downloaded Emacs 26.3 from Emacs for Macos X. I installed it as Emacs 3 (and Emacs 27 as Emacs 2).
 I ran Emacs 3, and everything worked fine. Now I can upgrade my configuration at my leisure, and my workflow is uninterrupted.
 My googling didn't highlight this easy answer, causing me to waste time doing questionable things at the Terminal.
 I have a complicated setup with Chemacs profiles etc, and it somewhat surprised me when everything just worked. That's why I use MacOS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone built this? How tough would it be? Does anyone have ideas on where to start?
 To expand, I've noticed a recurring problem in big projects: someone makes a small, trivial change and then has to wait 30-45 minutes for all tests to run. This wastes time and compute. Over time, developers adjust the size of PRs to account for this. Instead of making small isolated changes, they batch a bunch of changes into a single PR so the tests all run together. At some point they break the repo up. Now they have to think about dependency chains, and they've copied a bunch of build boilerplate into many repos.
 I think a powerful solution would be to only re-run tests for code that changed. We can periodically re-run all tests on main/master, maybe once daily. We can add some configuration/annotation to specify that a particular test or test suite should always run.
 How would it work? At the very least, it would have to integrate with SCM to compare what's on main/master vs. on the current commit. But it seems naive to just compare which source files show up in the diff. Seems like it might have to do something at the bytecode level? Maybe some sort of instrumentation similar to what code coverage tools are doing. I haven't done much at that level.
 In any case, thanks for reading. I'm pretty keen to try to build something along these lines. Excited to read any ideas/links/tips you all might have.
 ​
 Update:
  
Thanks for the fun discussion! It sounds like some combination of testQuick and SBT's remote cache are worth a try. If I'll try to experiment with this and either post back here or write up a blog post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After some research, it seems that for writing a GRPC server in Haskell there are two options:
  
gRPC-haskell (which does not work)
 warp-grpc (using proto-lens like described here)
  
So for warp-grpc, I tried following the example but it panics:
 ``` $ git clone https://github.com/lucasdicioccio/warp-grpc-example . $ stack build ghc: panic! (the 'impossible' happened) (GHC version 8.4.3 for x86_64-unknown-linux): Prelude.chr: bad argument: 1526726659
 Please report this as a GHC bug: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/reportabug ```
 After updating resolver: lts-19.6, I get complaints about version constraints from packages.
  
For now, all I want is to do a GRPC server and not run an outdated example (without allow-newer set in the global stack.yaml):

 so suppose we have a list lst = [ (x1,y1) , (x2, y2) , (x3, y3), (x4, y4) ]. I know what my perimeter function does is basically:
 dist (x1,y1) (x2,y2) + perimeter [(x2, y2),(x3, y3),(x4,y4)] dist (x1,y1) (x2,y2) + dist (x2,y2) (x3,y3) + perimeter [(x3,y3),(x4,y4)] dist (x1,y1) (x2,y2) + dist (x2,y2) (x3,y3) + dist (x3,y3) (x4, y4) perimeter [(x4,y4)] 
 now in order to make the perimeter complete, ideally somehow if we're given the original list x:y:ys then perimeter(z:[]) = dist x z (in other words, head of original list + last of original list). So in our specific case, we'd end with:
  dist a b + dist b c + dist c d + dist d a 
 but I'm at a loss on how to get this to work. I'm sure it's something very simple. Any hints or suggestions would be much appreciate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I compile an el file, I sometimes don't see all the possible "undefined" warnings because they depend on the currently loaded packages in my emacs session. For example, if the file depends on the package org, some warnings would not show if org was loaded when I opened an org file before or if org is loaded by default in my init file.
 How do I make sure that compilation always happens in a "clean environment" where no packages are loaded? Running with emacs -Q would not work since custom packages can never be loaded, for example with eval-when-compile (unless I set up the load-path which is difficult since it is set by straight in my case).
 Also, would the compilation result be the same whether these required packages (like org in my example) are loaded or not? In other words, is it safe to ignore these warnings?

But what do you do with the original source?
I ask because I work a lot with articles and academic papers, so I fear I'd lose pieces of information that may be useful in the future (but not in the present, so they don't go into my Zettelkasten).
On the other hand I want to keep the workflow as simple and frictionless as possible.
I have DevonThink that is great, but I always encounter lot of friction when I store the files in it.
Any help and experience would be highly appreciated.
Thank you!]]></summary>

With other words, I would like to be able to type code that will go into functions one piece at a time, scattered in prose. Does anyone know if this is possible with org mode and how?
 If anyone is familiar with Knuth's literal programming system, one can add named statements to code blocks with "+=" syntax. As an illustration, here is a piece of code from Pharr & Humphrey Physically Based Rendering which is written in literal programming style (the one where I have seen this system in use, but there are probably others):
 <Function Definitions> ≡ void InitGlobals() { <Initialize Global Variables 2> } 
 Fragment "initialize global variables":
 <Initialize Global Variables> ≡ shoe_size = 13; 
 Add to the fragment:
 <Initialize Global Variables> +≡ dielectric = true; 
 Results with:
 void InitGlobals() { shoe_size = 13; dielectric = true; } 
 Edit: Ok, thank you all for pointing me to noweb. Didn't used it before and didn't know what it was, but it seems like exactly what I am asking for :).

emacs keys, not evil
 caps lock mapped to control
 left option as meta
 left command as super (not sure if I should change this to meta yet)
 right command mapped as F7
  
This looks somewhat sane and I can easily bind the menu key in other keyboards to F7 (or other F key) as well. 
 F7 is a prefix key and I’m using it as something similar to general.el as in “<f7>w” opens a prefix for my windows commands for example (like SPC w in doom or whatever).
 I wanted to map right command to hyper but that does not play nice with macos terminals.
 This is looking very nice to me, I honestly was not fully aware I could achieve this as I’m somewhat a beginner.
 I was using a lot of chords too but I reduced their usage due to some conflicts. They are still pretty awesome to have though (a quick “tt” opens vterm-toggle for example).
 Does this look sane to you guys? Is it too good to be true?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some reason, a few months ago the line spacing in Org Mode has increased. It's the line spacing between display lines, not merely between paragraphs or headings. The line spacing in my org-mode files has increased to 1.5 or 2 (just guessing).
 The variable "line-spacing" is nil. Actually setting it doesn't help.
 If I open a non-org-mode text file in emacs, the line spacing is fine.
 I discovered that the issue comes from org-indent-mode. But I also don't know why org-indent-mode would cause this. Does anyone have any ideas of what setting I can change?
 UPDATE: I was able to fix this by following the solution at the link provided below by JDRiverRun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My first language is not English and so my keyboard layout is not the US layout. In many international layouts, the right Alt is AltGr and does not work as a Meta key. I like this keyboard layout otherwise.
 Ideally, I would like to not have to move my hands away from the home row, but having only the left Alt available as Meta and reaching for AltGr (right Alt) from time to time breaks my flow.
 I tried switching CapsLock with AltGr and this would be the ideal layout. Using xmodmap, I think I was able to do it, but I could not understand what I did satisfactorily even after reading the doc. I don't like using tools that I cannot understand.
 Also something does not feel right about having a "non standard" keyboard layout. I don't want to make my life harder if I use another computer or OS. Do you have an opinion on that?
 What is your personal setup?

Note that the ace-jump libraries haven't been changed for 8 years, so lib issues can't be a problem. Unless there is more recommended alternative https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use this library in my haskell program to generate a source map file, but getting some performance issue. The size of the mapping file generated was about 30M bytes, and it took almost 130 secs to get it. It's much more slower than I expected, though I can not figure out what's the problem causing it. Here's my code looks like:
 ​
 generateSrcMap :: String -> [FilePath] -> SourceRange -> Value generateSrcMap sFile srcs sourceRanges = generate $ SourceMapping { smFile = sFile, smSources = srcs, smSourceRoot = Nothing, smMappings = mappings } where mappings = mapMaybe getMapping $ zip sourceRanges [0 ..] getMapping :: (SourceRange, Int) -> Maybe Mapping getMapping (SourceRange start _ _, idx) = if srcFile == "std" then Nothing -- skip mapping stdlib code else Just $ Mapping { mapGenerated = Pos 1 $ fromInteger $ toInteger idx, -- business logic, use index as column mapOriginal = Just (Pos line column), mapSourceFile = Just srcFile, mapName = Nothing } where !srcFile = sourceName start !line = fromInteger $ toInteger (1 + unPos (sourceLine start)) !column = fromInteger $ toInteger $ unPos $ sourceColumn start 
 ​
 Also I tried using this rust library to run decode/encode the same source map json file. It turns out to be much fast than the Haskell code I wrote. It took ~14 secs for decoding and ~3 secs for encoding. So any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm migrating from Company to Corfu to try its integration with Orderless. I want to replace M-i, my "invoke company manually" key binding, with a trigger for Corfu.
 But I couldn't find a built-in function to invoke Corfu. It's usually triggered by TAB, but I prefer TAB to indent and never complete at the moment.
 I whipped up this hack by looking at how Corfu's UI is being triggered:
 (defun ct/corfu-trigger () (interactive) (corfu--auto-complete (corfu--auto-tick))) (global-set-key (kbd "M-i") #'ct/corfu-trigger) 
 It injects the auto tick so the internal equal check passes.
 I tried to bind to completion-at-point but even though that's what the TAB key (with the suggested configuration) is eventually calling, my bindings spawned the completions in the minibuffer instead of going through Corfu.
 What's a more elegant way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Emacs with Spacemacs right now on my Mac and it is mostly OK but there are certainly some issues when it comes to things like bad out-of-the-box macOS integration when it comes to things like file permissions, unimplemented tabs on macOS - although they work on Linux, some scrolling render refresh bugs, buggy window resizing, and the list goes, unfortunately, on... ;)
 Aquamacs apparently seems to have all this fixed and tailored for the Mac while giving you the option to customize things to perhaps even Spacemacs like experience - most of Spacemacs is really just packages setup to work nicely together.
 Also, Aquamacs people say that they even plan a separate Apple Silicon version (M1,M2) of Aquamacs (= better performance and longer battery) which is probably never gonna happen with the regular GNU Emacs. Or maybe I am wrong?
 BUT... maybe... there are some cons? And perhaps some are a dealbreaker preventing me to migrate from Emacs/Spacemacs to Aquamacs?
 For people who have used Aquamacs, what has been your experience? What are are pros and cons against a regular Emacs? Were there any dealbreakers?
 Also, how is it running Aquamacs and regular Emacs (with Spacemacs) on the same computer/user account? Will they play along nicely and don't mess things up, or they will be rewriting each others' configs all the time?
 UPDATE:
 I am using Evil mode, and also a leader SPC key so I basically don't use traditional Command bound Emacs keybindings.
 This seems to be a frequent "con" by people coming from vanilla Emacs when I try to find some cons of Aquamacs via Google - but in my case, that is not an issue.
 I am more worried about the compatibility of packages and code of Emacs Lisp scripts I will find on the Internet and whether it will run or not.
 Also, are there any weird hidden you-might-notice-them-only-after-a-few-months quirks that Aquamacs has when compared with vanilla Emacs?

 GNU Emacs is a wholly remarkable existence. It is not only ancient, but sharp: a wise master that has seen others fall and learned from their mistakes. It exists as a sort of second user land, integrating the underlying OS's built in libraries and utilities into a rich-text interface powered by thousands of lines of tried and true lisp code.
 Microsoft Windows is also a wholly remarkable existence. It, too, has quite the history; yet the Windows OS itself (and DOS before it) has largely served as a mcguffin in its own tale. Indeed, the rise of Microsoft and the personal computer seem to have taken place in spite of their OS's glaring deficiencies rather than because of any particular merit. And still, somehow, Windows 10 is ... Dare I say ... Kinda good? The move…]]></summary>

If I try to open a file directly in the terminal version of emacs (e.g. emacs -nw filename), emacs won't open the file -- instead I get an error message saying: Symbol’s value as variable is void: \213, and a blank buffer. As far as I can tell, emacs works normally after that, and I can open the file with C-x C-f but it's a bit of an annoyance. The --debug-init option gives no additional output. This only happens with the -nw option. The gui works normally. Anybody know what's going on here? PS: I'm on MacOS and using the emacs-plus distribution from Homebrew. EDIT: After some investigation it turns out the following code inside my init.el file was the issue: (defvar startup/file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist) (setq file-name-handler-alist nil) (defun startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist () (setq file-name-handler-alist startup/file-name-handler-alist)) (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook 'startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist) Anybody know why this‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­would cause the error on emacs28?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: I maintain org-gcal, a package that lets users synchronize Google Calendar events with Org-mode files. One of the features that I have is a way to download the event description as HTML. Right now, I just download the raw HTML and place it in a drawer.
 I'd like to have the ability to wrap this HTML in some kind of block and preview it as Org-mode syntax, so that it's easier to read it in Emacs. I'm thinking of wrapping the text in a #+BEGIN_SRC html block (or maybe a custom block), calling out to Pandoc to convert the HTML to Org, and overlaying the Org-mode syntax to replace the HTML block (like org-display-inline-images, org-preview-html but with Org syntax instead of an image, graphviz-dot-mode, etc.
 I'd like a solution that preserves the original HTML, because org-gcal supports updating Google Calendar events based on the Org-mode file.
 Does anyone know of a library like this?

 If my case class is in the same file as my implicit conversions everything works fine. However I’d like to be able to reference case classes all over the place and use my implicit conversions but I keep getting errors related to implicits not being found. 
 To be a bit more concrete my implicits are in an object in the package 
 Root.sub1o
 When the case class is in the package Root.sub1a.sub2a.sub3a.sub4a.sub5a everything works fine!
 When the case class is in the package 
 Root.sub1a.sub2b.sub3b.sub4b.sub5b however I get errors about my implicits being out of scope. This seems kind of baffling to me but I’m sure I’m missing something obvious / fundamental

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Emacs and Doom for a while now and a couple of months ago my fancy icons (which I believe are provided by the all-the-icons package) have disappeared. I just see a bunch of boxes with "F0??" codes in them. 
 I tried re-running the all-the-icons-install-fonts command, and according to Emacs it runs successfully. I also see the following under $HOME/.local/share/fonts:
  all-the-icons.ttf et-book-display-italic-old-style-figures.ttf et-book-roman-old-style-figures.ttf file-icons.ttf material-design-icons.ttf weathericons.ttf et-book-bold-line-figures.ttf et-book-roman-line-figures.ttf et-book-semi-bold-old-style-figures.ttf fontawesome.ttf octicons.ttf 
 Also, Emacs no longer seems to be able to find any of the fonts under $HOME/.local/share/fonts. For example, ETBembo used to be my primary, non-coding font, but Emacs can no longer find that either.
 I've also run 'fc-cache -f -v` about 100 times :-)
 I tried some of the troubleshooting steps on https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el but those instructions seem to address issues with individual icons. I can't see any icons.

 sorry for the newbie quetion, I thought I got this but clearly I was wrong. So basically I want to modify a previous commit in my repo (by adding some modifications I already have in my workspace). Following a suggestion from Magit's author (here https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/22565/29817), Magit seems to have a command that should work pretty well for me: `magit-rebase-edit-commit`, bound by default to `r m`. Point is, when I do that, I see the buffer you see in the picture. If I need to add some lines to this commit, what should I do, since there's no "Unstaged files" section?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The `template-haskell` library has an enormous library of "lower-case" monadic helpers, things like this: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-2.18.0.0/docs/Language-Haskell-TH-Lib.html#v:appE 
 These are just the normal algebraic data types and functions lifted to work on monadic arguements. But... why? We don't do this for any other monad, and modern Haskellers are perfectly comfortable writing `AppE <$> x <*> y` rather than `appE x y`. And it's quite expensive - you have a huge module that duplicates every single function in this form, and it leads to downstream confusion as people use the two styles inconsistently.
 I think the reason for this existing may just be historical: this style was introduced in the TH paper in 2002, and applicatives weren't popularised until 2008. But they very much are popular now, so maybe we should deprecate it all and stop adding to it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 I am currently trying to do the following: only get headings that are the next actions to be taken. A concrete example: 
 * TODO Project ** TODO Task one, the next action that I want to see ** TODO Task two, but after the task one, not the next action 
 ​
 As you can see here, the next action is the task one.
 A slightly more complicated example: 
 * Project ** TODO Not next action *** TODO Next action *** TODO Not next action ** TODO Not next action * Another Project ** DONE Task one ** TODO Another next action 
 ​
 I managed to make a function with "org-agenda-skip-function" which allows me to find its famous next action. But how to do it with org-ql ? Is there a possibility to "translate" this function into an org-ql query ?I'm also thinking of creating a new predicate, "brother-up", which would return true if the heading has a heading of the same level before it
 So maybe I could find the next action by taking the following headings:
  
no task in done
 no descendant
 no "brother up" not done
  
I'm a bit lost, because I don't even know if it would work, and if I have thought about everything. I don't know exactly in which direction to go, because there is maybe an another better solution that I didn't think of.
 Thanks in advance for your answers :)

 I see the keycode f21 when I press it in Karabiner EventViewer as you can see here: https://i.imgur.com/ELylaKn.png
 I have tried f22 as well. Doesn't work.
 In Emacs I cannot make it run, e.g. this doesn't work:
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f21> t") (lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/Documents/test.txt"))) 
 But this does work:
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f15> t") (lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/Documents/test.txt"))) 
 Also, the f20 triggers C-p or something but that is some Menu key issue with macOS so I will just don't use that like that.
 But I would really like to use f21 - f24 or even higher as I am planning to purchasing X-keys programmable keypad and would like to use it with Emacs.
 Thanks for any advice how to make the function keys about 20 work in Emacs on macOS.
 UPDATE:
 I made this video where on the right you can see Karabiner EventViewer showing the key code f21 when Emacs shows nothing. At the end I included the log of pressed keys (C-h l) as well:

 Recent emacs convert here, I'm using emacs with org-mode / org-roam for documentary filmmaking and freelance video work. Still working on a better workflow than what I have currently 
 I was wondering if someone has tried to integrate Emacs with their stream deck ? 
 Here is what I imagine it would be useful for : 
 - starting and stopping project timer with org-clock
 - global macros for pulling up a new notes or todo entry, or just general emacs macros
 - macro pad for more exotic commands that one might want to run every so often, or for switching buffers (with preview of the buffer name on the stream deck ?)
 ​
 All of these to me seem like feasible and useful. As I am relatively new to programming and elisp, I have a vague idea of how to implement this myself, but if someone has already gone through the trouble I would be happy to hear how they went about it !
 I use Doom emacs - macros and key bindings are pretty clear and easy to implement but more ways of interacting with emacs would be a plus for me ! 
 I imagine for the global commands something like the emacs api would need to be used, I've got to look into it more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liquid Haskell (LH) is a tool that gives the Haskell
programmer the ability to express what a program is meant to compute
and to verify that the program does meet this expectation.
One aspect that was not easy to deal with was understanding verification
failures. When a failure happened, we could get a summary of the condition that
LH was trying to verify, but we wouldn’t be able to say exactly which facts LH
was using to check it or which facts were missing.
In this post I will present some recent contributions of mine to LH, which give
the user better access to the facts used during verification. We will go through
an example of how these facts can be used to help LH prove a property in a more
informed way than previously possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my transients has recently changed behavior, and is very bothersome. Normally I would use it to choose a file from the project and then, with the transient menu staying open after visiting the file, I can press the another transient key and do that thing. But no more.
 Now, after visiting a file, it looks the same as before -- meaning, the transient stays open at the bottom of the screen -- but my cursor has now moved to the file itself and attempting to press one of the transient keys just inserts that character into the buffer, as if transient wasn't there. I then usually have to get rid of the inaccessible transient menu by calling another transient and cancelling it immediately, after which my screen has returned to full no-transient normal.
 Why would this one command be now causing my transient to lose focus without visibly exiting? The find-file or switch-to-buffer ones work just fine without any unexpected context changes: that is, the transient stays focused with them until I directly cancel it. 
 Code:
  (defun tsa/projectile (&optional choose-project) "Navigate the project files, possibly choosing project first" (interactive "P") (if choose-project (projectile-switch-project) (projectile-find-file))) ;; this is bound to <f2> (transient-define-prefix tsa/transient-window () "Window navigation transient" :transient-non-suffix 'transient--do-quit-one :transient-suffix 'transient--do-stay [["Switch" ("b" "buffer" switch-to-buffer) ("f" "find-file" find-file) ("g" "git-grep" consult-git-grep) ("p" "projectile" tsa/projectile) ;; THIS one is the issue ("F" "follow" follow-mode) ("a" "ace 1" transient-ace-cmd)] ])

 I saw this thread about the issues that arise from this change:
 Unintended consequences of removing org-speed-commands-user
 Are there any people who find the speed-keys as useful as me? 
 Is there a robust/idiomatic way to add your own commands, now that they are all lumped into ~org-speed-commands~? Some kind of use of ~append~ or ~add-to-list~ maybe?

I used to use Emacs such that I could see the clock on my OS, but now I want to try using Emacs entirely full-screen; problem is, I don't have a clock any more. I used to have it on the mode-line, but I didn't like how the time was replicated everywhere, and it was taking up space that I wanted for other things.
 Is there a way to put a clock, say, in the right side of the tab-bar? This is a little line of space that is almost never in use, so it'd be perfect.
 Update: Here's a hack that I don't recommend, but it was kinda fun to figure out: it uses a posframe and a timer to get it to display: https://paste.sr.ht/~ashton314/4d490af6b4c6ae2f00012c8d807383001b242f1e
 There are some better suggestions in the comments, which I'll probably be using. :)
 2nd Update: Thanks to u/karthink, I've found a solution that works perfectly:
 lisp (add-to-list 'tab-bar-format 'tab-bar-format-align-right 'append) (add-to-list 'tab-bar-format 'tab-bar-format-global 'append) (setq display-time-format "%a %e %b %T") (setq display-time-interval 1) (display-time-mode)

 I've installed ghc 9.2.3 via ghcup. But it didn't work by default. I was getting linking errors when building any software: ~~~ $ ghc Main.hs ... ld64.ldd: error: unknown argument '--gc-sections' clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 ~~~
 I had to set: ~~~ ("ld is GNU ld", "NO") ~~~ In my settings file to fix this.
 Is this a bug in my initial set-up or ghc's bindist? I'm assuming it should work without having to tweak any default settings, and the ghc webpage claims that all I should need is the xcode command line tools installed.
 Next, I'm wanting to use the default ng code generator, rather than the llvm, so I'm slightly concerned that it is invoking clang.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I'm not a web-developer, but I occasionally use emacs for writing HTML. I've been far from memorizing the tags and attributes in HTML - with programming languages, I don't memorize the parameter list :/. So, I usually have an idea of what I want to do in HTML, but need to resort to googling/duckduckgo-ing quite frequently.
 However, I felt, it would be pretty great if there were some mode / emacs-extension / some-eww-friendly-website that could provide the tags, and the attributes that each tag takes, may be along with small examples as well as "see also". I've tried company-web and lsp-mode, and both provide descriptions of tags (which I mostly don't need!) but don't provide the attributes. With other languages, it is a great help to see the parameter list in the echo area, or even the function/macro/keyword documentation with a simple command.
 So, if anyone knows about this, it'd be great!
 Thanks you!
 EDIT: Moments after I posted this, yasnippet struck me; and it is helpful, but the tag-attribute reference manual would still be appreciated!

 I have a problem using tramp with my ssh config file and ProxyJump . I just can't figure out why it does not work. The situation is the folowoing:
 Machine_A ---> JumpMachine ---> Machine_B
 My ssh config for that looks as follows:
 Host Machine_B Hostname <some_ip> User <my_username> Port <some_port> ProxyJump JumpMachine ServerAliveInterval 60 Host JumpMachine Hostname <some_ip> User <Some_user> Port <some_port> ProxyCommand <a_simple_bashscript> IdentityFile <my_identiyfile> Host Machine_B_admin Hostname <some_ip> User <my_admin_username> Port <some_port> ProxyJump JumpMachine ServerAliveInterval 60 
 Machine B has no PW auth, only the jumpmachine. Both can be obviously accesed using ssh. The setup works with my shell (fish) as well as other shells and with vscode.
 ​
 What is really strange, is that that tramp always asks me for ssh:Machine_B passsword: while only the JumpMachine has a password. The PW auth is turned off for ssh on Machine_B. I tried using the password for JumpMachine and Machine_B and neither works. TBH I am not really sure what to do by now.
 I just wanted to mention that there is also another entry for my admin account. Don't know if that matters in any way.
 Any tips?

Everything I tried from the many help threads for this very problem failed, so I tried C-h v inhibit-startup-screen to see if these variables were indeed being set correctly. In fact, the value of inhibit-startup-screen was nil, and it is being set by startup.el.
 How can I have startup.el not overwrite my Emacs configuration file?
 EDIT: Found the solution. There were some errors in loading the Emacs config file, however the splash/startup screen hid those errors, so I never knew there were any problems. When the config file couldn't finish loading, it didn't get to my (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) instruction, hence it used the default startup.el setting. Resolving those errors meant that the config file would load entirely, and indeed the startup screen would be inhibited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would it be possible to use emacs as a keyboard macro and automation tool outside of emacs.
 There is things like keyboard maestro for mac or autohotkey that let you create macros and assign them to keys in certain programs. Autohotkey uses an alien syntax and keyboard maestro is mostly mouse based. They are ok but I always wondered if using elisp and emacs would be a more powerful combination. Besides, it would ran on all platforms. Would emacs server be able to do something like this? Anyone ever tried to do something like this?
 I have never tried EXWM but looking at performance I dont think it would work for me since this is for heavy post production tools.
 Update: thanks for the Linux suggestions but I am looking for a solution that runs on Mac and Windows mostly since all post production tools widely used run on those.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came across this stackoverflow question while searching for tutorials on Vector (specifically IO, MVector). And one of the replies to the answer said the following:
  
...is that lists are basically as much a control structure as a data structure in Haskell. And this makes sense: where you would use a C-style for loop in a different language, you would use a [1..] list in Haskell.
  
What does this mean? 
 I was searching for IOVector/MVector because I want to create a virtual machine; now for my purposes are Lists/Sequences the data structure I'm looking for, specially if I'd like to stick to a more functional paradigm.

The org-file in question is a bit long (~2k lines). When the app freezes, if I run pkill -USR2 Emacs from an external shell, I get to see the following debug trace:

 I'm using the latest Doom Emacs, with Emacs-Mac 28.1 (https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport) on an M1 Mac Air. Any tips/suggestions on how to debug this? Thanks in advance!

 I use a file as my main "dashboard" and I would like to insert an agenda view into it. The idea is to "refresh" this buffer, remove the currently displayed agenda, compute the agenda for the day, and insert it into this buffer.
 I can do lisp, but I wonder if there is something similar to what I am trying to do that might have been already implemented.
 I guess ultimately I can look at the source code of org-agenda and reuse its code, but I am wondering if I would be "rediscovering the wheel"
 thank you.

 I have a need for functionality I haven't been able to find, though I might just lack the proper terminology to find the solution. I am a emacs noob, using Doom Emacs mostly for JS/TS programming (the killer features I am in love in with are magit and the ease of being keyboard-only). 
 So, my problem: I am currently working on the largest project I had ever done, and I would like to have some sort of automated system that would crawl through my code, find all the comments with tags (such as TODO, NOTE...), and compile them into an org file (for example notes.org) at the root of my project. 
 It seems like a fairly simple problem, and I am almost certain there already is a solution, but I haven't really been able to find it. The reason I haven't written it yet is because while elisp is cool and I'd like to be able to understand it, I haven't had the time yet (and after I am done with work, I barely have the brain power to read a book, not to learn a wholly different language). 
 Any pointers would be most appreciated! Thanks

That place is trying to set a value for which I have a prism, especially for which I have a lens + prism that I want to use to reach deep into a value.
 Setting on a prism only replaces the value if the prism matches. I'd like to know if there is some optics construction that I can use to replace the value whether or not the prism matches. I know about review but that doesn't compose with lenses. I can ignore the prism and just use set on the lens with the value wrapped in the correct constructor, but I'm looking to see …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking at the [Data.Functor](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.2.0/docs/Data-Functor.html) documentation page on Hackage, the opening paragraph says 
  
A type f is a Functor if it provides a function fmap which, given any types a and b, lets you apply any function of type (a -> b) to turn an f a into an f b, preserving the structure of f. 
  
In this scenario is it valid to call f a type? And even if it is, considering its kind is * -> *, wouldn't it be more accurate (and even less confusing) to say it's a "type former" or type constructor? To my intuition it feels a little odd to say something is a type when its kind is not * so it isn't really a concrete type.

 This is the config I am using

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm making the switch from Neovim to Emacs for Clojure development.
 For the completion I'm used to <Tab> and <S-Tab> for cycling through suggestions, and the suggestions would be automatically placed in the buffer when selected so that <Enter> would only behave as a newline.
 This is what I got for now:
 elisp (use-package company :init (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode) :config (global-company-mode t) (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1) (setq company-idle-delay 0.0) :bind (:map company-active-map ("TAB" . company-select-next) ("<backtab>" . company-select-previous) ("RET" . nil))) 
 Issues:
  
Now I don't have a way to autocomplete since when I select suggestions they don't get placed in the buffer
 Placing S-TAB instead of <backtab> in the :bind section doesn't work
 If I tap <S-Tab>, then pressing <Enter> becomes unresponsive
  
Thanks! Any help is appreciated. :D (Also if you see some bad practice tell me please)
 EDIT: did I do something wrong? I see a 50% of downvoting rate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I type `sshx:` after typing the colon I'll get prompted for my local machine's password, like I should normally. But then if I try to type the username and IP of the remote machine, every single character I type causes Tramp to ask me for the local machine password again. I have to hit ESC to show the original Tramp prompt again. Typing another character asks for the password again. You get the idea.
 Has anyone else had this? I don't even know where to look to know what to fix.

Since lists are fundamental to Haskell, I was wondering if Haskell represents lists as actual linked lists in memory. If it does, then how much does Haskell suffer performance wise because of this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've released version 0.2 of plz.el, my HTTP library for Emacs Lisp that uses curl as a backend. This version includes a new feature, a simple request queue system. It works like this:
 (defvar my-queue (make-plz-queue :limit 2)) (plz-run (plz-queue my-queue 'get "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=0" :then (lambda (body) (message "%s" body)))) 
 Or:
 (let ((queue (make-plz-queue :limit 2)) (urls '("https://httpbin.org/get?foo=0" "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=1"))) (plz-run (dolist (url urls queue) (plz-queue queue 'get url :then (lambda (body) (message "%s" body)))))) 
 So far it's only been used in the newest version of Ement.el, my Matrix client for Emacs, to queue requests for images (like room avatars, image messages, etc). It seems to be working well, but please let me know if there are any issues.

 Sometimes when I shutdown emacs and fire it up again I get some errors like this and my perspectives ares gone:
 Error: Can not autoresume perspectives -- (error Buffer is not associated with any file xxxxxxx )
 As the error says, the problem is that for some pre-existing buffer in the saved perspective there is not anymore a file to the buffer to load from.
 This seems like it should have a simple fix, IF THE FILE IS GONE, KILL THE BUFFER! But I did not find how to configure persp-mode to behave like that. Does any one knows how to do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya everyone, I've been using Org mode for a while and have also tried the likes of Notion, Confluence/Jira and a plethora of other tools as a knowledge base/project management options within different teams.
 Is there a way to use Org without forcing an entire team to learn Emacs and a sync workflow? The Org+git workflow is understandably a big ask and I've experienced the pain a few times already. I'd like to use Org in Emacs on my own machines but have other team members access the data through a lower entry-barier interface such as the web.
 Tools like LogSeq seems to want to head there but still have a large focus on having to obtain their client first. Many teams are familiar with the "login through SSO and make changes" kind of workflow, so I'm keen to learn what's in this space and how you all solve this problem -- in case this is even a problem for y'all. Is this even a reasonable ask or shall I just stuck it up and suffer through Notion and Confluence/Jira?
 PS: I'm often fill of rage when I use those tools but as I find them inhibiting (breaking my flow) but maybe I just need a (better) therapist. 🤷🏿‍♂️

 I tried to set a custom shortcut for the command tabspaces-switch-to-buffer. 
 I have this:
 (global-set-key (kbd "M-b") 'tabspaces-switch-to-buffer) 
 and got the error: wrong type argument, commandp. This is weird because I bind the tab-next
 and tab-previous in exactly the same fashion. 
 ​
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-<left>") 'tab-previous) (global-set-key (kbd "C-<right>") 'tab-next) 
 So I am not sure why it gives the error. The command when run via M-x works fine.

 I wanted to insert a question into my daily journaling practice (aka a "journaling prompt"). Maybe someone will find this useful:
 A touch of capture templates:
 ("dj" "Journal" entry (file+olp+datetree ,(concat org-directory "/personal-daily-2022.org")) "* Entered on %U Prompt: %(dm/get-journaling-prompt) %?") 
 And a bit of elisp:
 (defun dm/get-journaling-prompt () "Returns a single line from journaling prompts." (save-window-excursion (find-file (concat org-roam-directory "journaling_prompts.org")) (goto-char (point-max)) (let* ((number-of-prompts (- (line-number-at-pos) 10))) (goto-line (+ 10 (random number-of-prompts))) 
 This is what it ends up looking like after invoking the correct capture template: https://dmitrym0.github.io/ox-hugo/2022-07-17_13-10-28_screenshot.png
 and a quick blog post about it: https://dmitrym0.github.io/posts/journaling-prompts-with-emacs/

My plans for this coming week include continuing my deep dive into The Tao of Travel by Paul Theroux. Theroux's book is an interesting turn on the philosophy of travel. I'm connecting ideas about the philosophy of travel with relativity and space/time.
I'm starting the book The Book of Form and Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki. I don't know what to expect at this point. The many layers of story in her first book moved me a lot: A Tale for the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki. I just ordered The Book of Form and Emptiness via InterLibrarary Loan, and it took four months to get it (the anticipation built up my expectations!). It came across the country from the Yuma Public Library. Thanks, University of Idaho Library, for hunting it down and the community of Yuma for lending it!
Here are a few of the titles of zettel I've been working on last week. The top two in the list are still in my "#proofing" oven.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Community,
 my goal is to build a Haskell package (library). The ultimate goal of this process is to have this package installed locally and to be able to use these functions.
 After cabal init, cabal configure and cabal build, This is the output after cabal install:
 PS D:\Documents\HaskellProjects\finance> cabal install --lib Wrote tarball sdist to D:\Documents\HaskellProjects\finance\dist-newstyle\sdist\finance-0.1.0.0.tar.gz Resolving dependencies... Build profile: -w ghc-8.10.7 -O1 In order, the following will be built (use -v for more details): - finance-0.1.0.0 (lib) (requires build) Starting finance-0.1.0.0 (lib) Building finance-0.1.0.0 (lib) Installing finance-0.1.0.0 (lib) Completed finance-0.1.0.0 (lib) PS D:\Documents\HaskellProjects\finance> 
 I am not able to use the package, though. 
 When entering
 cabal list --installed ghc-pkg list 
 My package does not show up. 
 ​
 Which step am I missing or doing wrong? 
 Thank you so much for your help

Instead of passing along the original structure you pass down add helper data structure instead. For my specific use case i am looking to typecheck an AST, when in a declaration node i would like to add to the helper data structure, essentially building the data structure when going from the root to the leaves. Then going from the leaves to the root i can use the helper structure when identfiers are used.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago my personal note taking was no longer based on trial and error but on a solid concept called Bullet Journaling. It started on paper with a lovely Moleskin book and a black fine liner from Neuland. Going digital with my Bullet Journal I decided to use a brilliant tool for note taking named OneNote. But time went by. In March 2022 I got my first contact with Obsidian and at the same time with the Zettelkasten method from Niklas Luhmann explained in the brilliant book from Sönke Ahrens about “How to take Smart Notes”.
Migration from OneNote to Obsidian was a migration from structured notes to networked notes. But how to migrate a Bullet Journal to a Zettelkasten? Difficult to switch from one concept to another? No, it’s very easy. The Bullet Journal is now a set of Structure Notes in my Zettelkasten. Also Zettelkasten is a Custom Collection in my Bullet Journal.
In other words:
my Zettelkasten is a Bullet Journal and
my Bullet Journal is a Zettelkasten.
The best of all: I did not need to change the basic concepts from Ryder Carroll (Bullet Journal), neither the concepts from Niklas Luhmann (Zettelkasten). Both concepts support each other in a perfect manner.
What about your experiences with theses methods? Do you use the Dataview plugin to support your Bullet Journal collections?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With your help, I'd like to to understand how exporting completion candidates works with consult and embark.
 Here's a use-case that comes up a lot in my flow as a programmer: find & replace text matches.
 You might say projectile-replace works great but it prompts for every replace and is super annoying, especially on very large code-bases.
 So how to do it with consult and embark?
 I think I have come close with the following flow:
 - M-x consult-git-grep
 - #match-this-text
 Now, if I M-x embark-collect, I end up with an embark buffer. If, on the other hand, I M-x embark-export, I end up with a grep buffer. 
 Which of the two buffers do I need (why?), and how do I go about replacing the text I'm after?

I know Doomemacs offers a more Vim-like experience but I worried about getting lost without knowing more basics. So I was wondering whether it's a good path to basically just consider Doomemacs its own experience and start from there, as it were the basic editor?

 I jumped in the Org / DooM bandwagon in 2020. On my phone and tablet (termux / orgzly), and laptop (*nix)
 Org works for me because it's keyboard based, and on all my devices.
 Unfortunately I've struggled to leave noob level, and failed to make org mode into the "second brain" / virtual assistant I envisaged. I shouldn't complain as it's genuinely useful for GTD-like organisation and location based reminders (via tasker)
 I see the weekly tip thread in on r/emacs, but most of the tips are way more advanced than the level I'm at.
 Had anyone got any noob friendly tips about general org-mode capabilities to explore?
 My current workflow / level is:
  
Open org file from bookmark (dired)
 Edit and save org file
 use links, including to files, to organise stuff
 if there are conflicts (damn you syncthing), resolve with ediff
 if anything goes "weird" in emacs kill buffer / delete window until back to the fallback buffer - then try again.
  
I had some luck early on with tasker and bash scripts to manipulate org files based on various conditions - but I've long forgotten how all that works.
 Similarly, I tried to get notmuch mail setup two years ago, but ran into trouble with gmail and exchange authentication 
 Would love to hear your suggestions for my org-mode journey.
 I've also asked if there are any emacs-specific things I can try on the emacs sub

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Configuration of a Polysemy application
 This is yet another sequel to my Clean Architecture with Haskell and Polysemy article.
 In my last blog post I demonstrated how the actual hosting of a WAI web app (e.g. with the Warp server or on AWS Lambda) can be defined as a Polysemy effect. The idea was well received in the haskell subreddit and stirred some further discussions. One question that came up: why did I explicitly load configuration before starting the Polysemy effect interpreter? Wouldn’t it be much more in line with the overall idea of my Polysemy Clean Architecture to handle this loading also as an effect?
 I explained my reasons for this design but promised to look for a better solution.
 In this blog post I’ll explain the new design that I came up with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy. I'm completely new to Emacs. Just loaded it up for the first time on Ubuntu Studio 22.04 and the UI is way to small to see anything (see this screenshot).
 I looked for solutions and everyone says to Ctrl + Scroll Wheel, and that doesn't do it. It only zooms the editor. The UI / Window stuff itself says small.
 I tried installing the Spacemacs config to see if it would fix it, but it didn't.
 Any ideas on how to fix this?
 edit: The award goes to u/Faerryn for fixing it. Thanks to everyone else for the suggestions, but thankfully I don't have to try them. I've added the solution here for easy finding:
  
Open ~/.emacs.d/init.el
 Add (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "FONT HERE" :height 120) to the file.
 Replace "FONT HERE" with your desired font.
 Save the file.

 I've gone through most of the tickets that reported similar errors, and the suggestion is to disable TemplateHaskell using the pragma {-# LANGUAGE NoTemplateHaskell #-}. However, that doesn't help in this case. I've opened a ticket myself, but open-source maintainers usually have other things to do, so, I'm not holding my breath.

 Stackage and stack are the most widely used tools we have. Many developers use the process for early discovery of library activity: who is behind the (sometimes punishing) pace of change; when will it be easiest to upgrade; which dependencies can I trust.
 With the PvP-style philosophy you have less visibility.

 I suspect that running org-mode after I open the file is the reason why it is slow.
 Can the same processing be done so long as the files is not interactively edited? The task involved is a read-only task?

 Sangria web page only demostrates how to combine alongside with akka and play. There's an example from tpolecat on GitHub but, it's outdate, some classes and packages from cats, http4s or doobie have been deprecated.
 Have you ever worked with http4s + sangria?.

 Example input: { "FirstName": "Arthur", "LastName": "Bertrand", "Address": { "StreetName": "Gedempte Zalmhaven", "Number": "4K", "City": { "Name": "Rotterdam", "Country": "The Netherlands" }, "ZipCode": "3011 BT" }, "Age": 35, "Hobbies": ["Fishing", "Rowing"] } 
 and convert to 
 Example Output: { "FirstName": "Arthur", "LastName": "Bertrand", "Age": 35, "Address": { "StreetName": "Gedempte Zalmhaven", "Number": "4K", "ZipCode": "3011 BT", "City": { "Name": "Rotterdam", "Country": "The Netherlands" } }, "Hobbies": ["Fishing", "Rowing"] }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
My name is Mike Kramer. Two years ago, I made a very low-effort comment on this forum, but I never introduced myself.
I first heard of the Zettelkasten Method by reading Ahrens's book. Through it, I discovered Christian and Sascha. From studying them, I realized that, just as the hardest part of GTD is processing--deciding which outcomes are worth committing to and which actions will cause those desired outcomes--the hardest part of a high-value Zettelkasten Method is specifying the nature of the connection that links one Zettel to another. GTD deals only with causal connections between items. The Zettelkasten Method can handle both causal and logical connections.
At the most fundamental level, my approach is based on the zettelkasten.de critique that says that a Folgezettel is a variant of the Collector's Fallacy. When I observe the work of other people, they usually cannot specify how a new note relates to its predecessor in the Folgezettel. They have the feeling that they have accomplished something meaningful, but, if they cannot write down the nature of the relation that obtains between connected notes, their thinking is inadequate.
To improve my own thinking, I track the status of the connections between my notes. Lumping a bunch of notes together is a low-effort, low-value kind of link compared to a link that shows how some notes provide reasons that support (or undermine) another note.
In March of this year, I produced a YouTube video of how I implement my method in Roam. Of course, this method could be implemented with other tools.

I welcome your feedback. I hope to be spending a bit of time in wilderness areas, so it might take me a week or so to respond.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the use case:
  
we're creating a simple in-memory use case for use in unit tests
 we use the builder pattern along with a library to generate reasonable fake data to generate mock objects
 we then need to use these builder functions to build objects *with valid relationships*. For example, children with parentIds that exist. 
 however, in order to do that, we need to create/access the same object instances. See below for what I mean.
 question: is there a functional approach?
  
Note: I'm actually a Typescript user (w/ some working haskell knowledge) but I figured this is one the best places to get answers for something like this :-) 
 ``` const deviceFactory = (): Device => ({ address: faker.internet.ipv4(), networkId: faker.unique(faker.datatype.number), serial: faker.unique(faker.datatype.number), });
 // I can do something like this to build specific devices // but then these objects are mutable, which is bad for tests const devices = [deviceFactory(), deviceFactory()] const switchDevices = [deviceFactory(), deviceFactory]
 // I can wrap these in functions // but then I get different objects each invocation const devices = () => [deviceFactory(), deviceFactory()]; const switchDevices = () => [deviceFactory(), deviceFactory];
 devices() // serial1, serial2 devices() // serialA, serialB ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently in the process of developing an app with similar or greater complexity to SimpleX chat and am looking for some advice regarding the usage of Haskell for a cross-platform logic layer.
 Haskell is currently my number one choice due to its elegance, however I have some concerns with how well it can be implemented. The app will initially be released on iOS and macOS with the platform specific code written in Swift. Later on I plan to expand to Android (Kotlin), Windows (likely .NET), and potentially the browser (WebAsm), each written in their native developemnt frameworks. Linux is also planned but I'm confident there will be no issues there.
 Does anyone have some advice or experience with this? I'm mainly worried about the following things:
  
Ease of compilation
 Performance
 Inter language API/ABI complexity
 Support for the the latest platform releases
  
Would it be better to just use Rust?
 ​
 Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!

 I'm on emacs 27 and this is happening using the rustic package with flycheck and eglot.
 If I disable eldoc before it ever holds docs, I'm not prompted to save.
 But If I look at something in eldoc, and even after I quit eldoc-mode, emacs wants to save only the examples section of eldoc.
 This is a bizarre error and I'm wondering if there's just a setting I have turned on? My next step is to dig into the eldoc code.
 EDIT:
 I've been annoyed by this for months, and I finally tracked it down to the " markdown-fontification-buffer:rust" buffer that gets created by eglot or lsp-mode. This led me to this fix for anyone else experiencing this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 It's taken ages, but finally the initial release of the effectful library is here 🎉
 For people unfamiliar with it, it's an extensible effects library that:
  
Is very fast (see benchmarks) when compared to other effect libraries and MTL as it's internally a ReaderT over IO.
 
Has flexible and easy to use API for higher order effects (similar to MonadUnliftIO).
 
Fixes subtle issues of popular monad transformers.
 
Makes it easy to integrate with the existing ecosystem of libraries.
 
 I started working on it after the eff effort was stalled due to a few unresolved issues.
 Over the years of writing Haskell professionally I got more and more tired of:
  
Boilerplate related to mtl style effects (along with complexity of monad-control).
 
Subtle issues of monad transformers that people new to the language were re-encountering over and over again.
 
The monad-control vs unliftio-core split that made it not possible to use some libraries together.
 
 effectful (as far as I know) solves these problems.
 FYI, there are already a few adapters for existing libraries (resourcet-effectful is already released and several are brewing here).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on the following problem:
  
Correctly determine the fewest number of coins to be given to a customer such that the sum of the coins' value would equal the correct amount of change. 
 For example: 
 An input of 15 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5) and one dime (10) or [5, 10] 
 An input of 40 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5) and one dime (10) and one quarter (25) or [5, 10, 25]
  
I've decided to solve it using top-down dynamic programming. To cache the results, I'm using a State Monad.
 module Change (findFewestCoins) where -- imports elided for brevity type Memo = Map Integer (Maybe [Integer]) type Coins = [Integer] type Change = Maybe Coins findFewestCoins :: Integer -> Coins -> Change findFewestCoins target coins = S.evalState (change target coins) MP.empty change :: Integer -> Coins -> State Memo Change change 0 _ = return $ Just [] change _ [] = return $ Nothing change target coins = do memo <- S.get if MP.member target memo then return $ MP.findWithDefault Nothing target memo else do let xs = filter (<= target) coins let loop coin = (coin :) <$> change (target - coin) coins let ys = map loop xs -- How to do this? let zs = M.catMaybes ys -- ((+) `on` f) x y = f x + f y let minBy = L.minimumBy (compare `F.on` length) let chng = if null zs then Nothing else Just $ minBy zs S.put (MP.insert target chng memo) return $ chng 
 The code may have bugs, but that's for later once I get it to compile. The problem is with this line:let ys = map loop xs
 Within a do block, it's easy to "dereference" the result of a single recursive call by simply doing ys <- loop, but here I have a list of states, and I don't know how to combine them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am looking for a method to overlap multi parameter type classes, such that i can declare functions for any parameter combination (containing multiple completely specified instances). My code snipped can explain this better than i do:
 newtype Dd x y = ToDd Cudd.DdNode deriving (Eq,Show) --x data F1 data F0 --y data S1 data S0 class DdF a b where bot :: Dd a b con :: Dd a b -> Dd a b -> Dd a b -- ..etc 
 "bot" is a constructor, so i need to fully specify the instances:
 instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F1 S1 where bot mgr = ToDd (Cudd.zddReadZero mgr) instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F1 S0 where bot mgr = ToDd (Cudd.zddReadOne mgr) instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F0 S1 where bot mgr = ToDd (Cudd.zddReadZero mgr) instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F0 S0 where bot mgr = ToDd (Cudd.zddReadOne mgr) 
 "con" has shared code between the S1 and S0 instances, so i am looking to defined these functions along the line of:
 instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F1 a where con mgr (ToDd z1) (ToDd z2) = ToDd (Cudd.zddIntersect mgr z1 z2) instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F0 a where con mgr (ToDd z1) (ToDd z2) = ToDd (Cudd.zddUnion mgr z1 z2) 
 Here i simplified to only 2 parameters, in my actual code i have 3 - and many functions requiring only one or two parameters to be specified. Implementing along the above manner would reduce duplicate code by a lot, and allows me to still make use of the type inference system.
 Yet when i run the code ("let y = con (bot :: Dd F1 S1) (bot :: Dd F1 S1)", with no compiler issues), examining y gives the following error : "[...] Exception: [...] : No instance nor default method for class operation con". 
 Am i misunderstanding the Overlapping and Multiparameter type-classes wrongly? Or is there an easy fix for what i want to achieve?

Copy and paste information, convert from markdown syntax to Office like structure. This is my main concern that I want to address in this post.
Requirement to produce plain text from small snippets of thoughts and bullet points. I know that this is probably the actual issue, where everyone has their own personal limits...
I personally am using vimwiki. I often have already structured text inside my wiki, so I am not following a dedicated ZK method, where I would provide very small pieces of information, as I have read it in your introduction. 
I am currently working in an environment where the documents for external partners need to be written and shared in MS Office and the internal documents with LibreOffice. I personally often share textfiles internally, but there are some that don't like this, and latest when we have a kind of official internal meeting, I "quickly" convert my initial text into Office document.
How do you effectively export things from your knowledge base into documents that you want to publish eventually having the following points in mind:
Efficient working: Information that is gained during writing the document to be published might also be needed to be transferred into you your knowledge base - duplicated information
Markdown syntax is not powerful enough to e.g. handle tables, so there is cumbersom reformating when moving data. Vimwiki syntax is not supported externally. AsciiDoc is a kind of strange to me. Multimarkdown was not fully supported by all my tools.
Laying out a document in MS Word or LibreOffice is for me a very time consuming process, when I copy plain text into it.
I tried several conversion methods like for example


exported html from vimwiki into word
several tries with pandoc (e.g. to LibreOffice)



Thank you]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya, I'm trying to learn how to make a Parser using this paper (p17): http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf and I just cannot seem to get the expr function to work using chainl1 ,addops and ops. It works fine using addop' but the regular addop isn't working :(.
 ​
 Here's my attempted implementation, what is going wrong?:
 ​
 newtype Parser a = Parser {runParser :: String -> [(a,String)]} instance Functor Parser where fmap f (Parser xs) = Parser $ \inp -> map (\(v,inp) -> (f v, inp)) (xs inp) instance Applicative Parser where pure = return Parser f <*> Parser x = Parser $ \inp -> [(func v, inp' ++ inp'') | (v, inp') <- x inp, (func, inp'') <- f inp] instance Monad Parser where return v = result v p >>= f = Parser $ \inp -> concat [runParser (f v) out | (v , out) <- runParser p inp] zero :: Parser a zero = Parser $ \inp -> [] result :: a -> Parser a result v = Parser $ \inp -> [(v,inp)] expr :: Parser Int expr = factor `chainl1` addop addop' :: Parser (Int -> Int -> Int) addop' = add `plus` minus where add = do _ <- char '+' return (+) minus = do _ <- char '-' return (-) -- addop rewritten in the context of ops addop :: Parser (Int -> Int -> Int) addop = ops [(char '+' , (+) ), (char '-' , (-) ) ] -- ops allow us to recursively put together operations ops :: [(Parser a, b)] -> Parser b ops xs = foldr plus zero op where op = do (p, op) <- xs _ <- [p] [result op] -- chainl1 is a function that parses non-empty sequences of items separated by operators that associate to the left: chainl1 :: Parser a -> Parser (a -> a -> a) -> Parser a chainl1 p op = p >>= rest where rest x = (op >>= \f -> p >>= \y -> rest (f x y)) `plus` return x test :: Num b => [(Maybe a,b)] -> Maybe b test xs = return $ foldr1 (+) fin where fin = do (x,y) <- xs _ <- [x] [y] a :: [(Maybe Integer, Integer)] a = zip (fmap Just [1..10]) [3..9] 
 test a returns 42.
 runParser expr "1+2+3" returns: [(1, "+2+3")] when it should return [(6,"")] ... [(1, "+2+3")]

 Hi,
 seasoned developer (C++, Elixir) but Haskell beginner here.
 I tried to implement a kata with the following specification:
 Having an array of (non-negative) integers, find a contiguous sub-sequence that has a given number S as its sum. Determine the value of the first and last element with indices starting from 1.
 E.g.:
 S = 15
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 Result: (1, 5)
 Here my absolutely not elegant (although it works) implementation in Haskell:
 -- ghc -O2 findrange.hs type Index = Int data Sequence = Sequence {begin :: Index, end :: Index, found :: Bool} deriving (Show) findRange :: Int -> [Int] -> Sequence findRange n = findSumSequence n 1 findSumSequence :: Int -> Int -> [Int] -> Sequence findSumSequence _ _ [] = Sequence 0 0 False findSumSequence n b (x : xs) = if found sequence then sequence else -- else findSum n (b + 1) 0 xs findSumSequence n (b + 1) xs where sequence = findSum n b 0 (x : xs) findSum :: Int -> Index -> Index -> [Int] -> Sequence findSum _ b e [] = Sequence b e False findSum n b e (x : xs) | x == n = Sequence b (b + e) True | x > n = Sequence b e False | otherwise = findSum (n - x) b (e + 1) xs main :: IO () main = print (findRange 15 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) 
 Three questions:
 1) How does my code look in the eyes of an Haskell expert?
 2) Do you have suggestions or tips I can do to improve it? 
 3) I did the same kata in C++ and using standard library and iterators, sliding the array just once (so O(n) complexity), and without recursion, it is INSANELY fast. Can I hope to reach the same performances in Haskell as well?
 Thank you 1K for your feedback.
 Nicola

 We are very happy to announce the release of Copilot 3.10. Copilot is a runtime verification system implemented as a Haskell DSL that generates hard-realtime C99. You can learn more about it at [1], [5].
 This new version of Copilot contains a small but important change in how structs are handled in C functions invoked by the monitors when property violations are detected. This change is API-breaking, so users of Copilot may need to adapt their systems accordingly. The release also contains a number of bug fixes, provides a simplified API, deprecates outdated elements, removes unused code, and relaxes version constraints for dependencies. A full list of changes merged is available at [2].

 I wanted to post my current understanding here, to check whether my understanding is correct? I feel like I'm still not 100% getting it.
 In elisp there are two distinct namespaces: one for functions and one for variables. This means I can have a variable called foobar and also a function called foobar, and they won't interfere with one another.
 If I want to evaluate a variable, then I just write the variable - eg foobar. If I want to evaluate a function, then I include it within parentheses (with arguments as needed) - eg (foobar arg1 arg2).
 If I want to refer to the symbol of a variable, then I prepend it with a quote - eg 'foobar. If I want to refer to the symbol of function, then I prepend it with a hash and quote - eg #'foobar.
 Lambdas are something of a mish-mash: they allow me to set the value of a variable to be a function, that will itself be called each time that variable is evaluated.
 Is that about it? Would love any feedback around where my understanding may have gone awry.

It was about two idiotic patrol cops who were always fooling around, never where they should be, and never answering the radio in their cop car.  There was an iconic phrase on their radio, that even came along with music - "Car 54 Where are You?".
For some reason, when I was contemplating our rather quiet forum over the past week, this phrase came to mind.]]></summary>

Users love it for being a superior tool for building, deploying, and managing software.
Yet, it is generally perceived as notoriously hard to learn.
The core Nix ecosytem consists of several distinct components:
The Nix package manager comes with a configuration language to declare software components, the Nix language.
Software made available through the package manager is centrally maintained in the Nix package collection, also known as nixpkgs.
There also exists a Linux distribution called NixOS, which is based on the package manager and the package collection.
In an attempt to provide an alternative learning approach, this article discusses the Nix package manager (hereafter simply referred to as Nix) and its underlying principles in the context of the…]]></summary>

 I have one little thing I have found to slow me down a little and wondering whether you guys had some suggestions.
 I used to have a buffer line with my current open buffers in Neovim and this allowed me to have 2-4 buffers/files in the bufferline that I was working on. It meant that I didn't have to think about which file I want to skip forward or back to - I would just look at the buffer line and then prev or next or wildcard to the buffer I want to skip to.
 In Emacs you do end up with a lot more open buffers so something similar wouldn't quite work but I wonder whether there are other solutions that might solve my issue. 
 I would be perfectly happy to mark the buffers that I am currently working on for example and have them displayed somewhere for ease. Or have them pop up at the top of my buffer or ibuffer list so they are easy to see and select.
 Any suggestions?

 data Expr = Number Int | Add Expr Expr | Minus Expr | Mult Expr Expr | Divide Expr Expr 
 They say this is in "normal form" because it's a sum (type) of products: Number Int + Add (Expr Expr) + .... Yes, I see that Expr is a sum type that, in turn, contains (but not exclusively) product types. But I'm not getting the significance of this.
 They go on to say
  
A stricter interpretation of normal form or “sum of products” would require representing products with tuples and sums with Either. The previous datatype in that form would look like the following
  
​
 type Number = Int type Add = (Expr, Expr) type Minus = Expr type Mult = (Expr, Expr) type Divide = (Expr, Expr) type Expr = Either Number (Either Add (Either Minus (Either Mult Divide))) 
 Before they talk about the distributive property, then saying:
  
Product types distribute over sum types.
  
I'm not really getting the significance of this and don't really understand the stricter interpretation. Any lore would be appreciated.

 (setq org-capture-templates '( ("n" "note" entry (file+olp+datetree "/Users/me/org/logbook.org" "JOURNAL") ... ) ("t" "tasks" entry (file+olp+datetree "/Users/me/org/todo.org" "TASKS") ... ) ) ) 
 I'm trying to change that so that the dirname portion -- /Users/me/org -- is already specified in a variable, and I can just append the different filenames for each template. But I'm having difficulty, having tried various methods including concat, expand-file-name, to mention only two.
 Two (elisp newbie) questions:
 1) What is the best way to do what I'm attempting?
 2) Second: to help me understand what I'm doing wrong, suppose I first set up a couple of variables like this:
 (setq org-directory "/Users/me/org") (setq org-logbook-file (concat org-directory "/logbook.org")) 
 Why is it that this then works: 
  entry (file+olp+datetree org-logbookfile-file "JOURNAL") 
 but this does not:
  entry (file+olp+datetree (concat org-directory "/logbook.org") "JOURNAL") 
 thx.

 For example:
  case class Person(name: String, surname: String, age: Int) case class PersonWithId(id: UUID, name: String, surname: String, age: Int) case class PersonWithEmail(name: String, surname: String, age: Int, email: Email) 
 All these case classes have circe/skunk codecs and other type class instances derived for it.
 Sometimes I use nesting, like WithId(id: UUID, item: Person), which makes it slightly better, but still
  
There's a lot of boilerplate
 I afraid that problems like type mismatch will start to appear after I get into my first refactoring
  
Is there a way to scratch this boilerplate a bit? I'd like to write something like:
 ``` case class Person(name: String, surname: String, age: Int) type PersonWithId = ("id", UUID) :: Person type PersonWithEmail = Person :: ("email", Email)
 given Encoder[PersonWithId] = deriveEncoder[PersonWithId]
 val withId = PersonWithId(UUID.random(), "Bob", "Smith", 27) ```
 I know Scala 3 has added many new tools around product types and wondering if there's anything that can help me out.
 PS. I just find it sad that TypeScript, a language that I'd think has weaker type system allows to do this out of the box:
  type Person = { name: string, surname: string, age: number } type PersonWithId = Pick<Person, "name" | "surname"> const withId: PersonWithId = { name: "Bob", surname: "Smith" }

 ​
 So my question is regarding the head of the list (x:xs). What exactly happens to x in the otherwise case? Does it just get dumped from memory? Not sure if my question is making sense, perhaps there's a better way to phrase it. I'm just a newbie trying to learn the language. It all makes a lot of sense so far, but I feel it would clear up much confusion to understand what's going on with regards to the head x.

I ran into the zettelkasten system while deep diving for ways to deepen my research, organize my usually jumbled thoughts, and connect my ideas. The zettel process is helpful because most of my work turns into written productsI often readng academic journals and think pieces on military concepts and other international policies.
I just restarted my zettel journey after reading Ahrens' "Smart Notes" and powering through a few Youtube videos. My current focus is figuring out a "good" way to process literature notes. My initial way of creating literature notes would be a two-step process: taking general notes while reading and then finalizing a summary for the "final literature note" to connect with my fleeting notes to create permanent notes.
I'm still a zettel newbie, so how do you process your literature notes? Any recommended readings about the topic? I look forward to engaging with everyone and learning more about the zettelkasten system!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Haskell for leisure a bit now, and for testing my code I've explored things like making a typeclass (with a real instance and a test instance), making an effect datatype and an interpreter, trying to separate pure and IO code. All of them required many changes to the existing code, and in the end I couldn't get many things out of it. 
 In the last week, I was touching Python for my job and its built-in mocking framework (unittest.mock). I was blown away. Nothing at all needs to change in the existing app code, yet I can mock and perform assertions on any function at all:
 # test that my function deletes the found file with mock.patch("glob.glob") as glob: # mock a return value glob.return_value = ["file.txt"] with mock.patch("os.remove") as remove: main_logic_to_delete_files() # perform asserts on no. times called and arguments remove.assert_called_once_with(path="file.txt") 
 It greatly lowered the barrier to perform unit tests for me, and I was amazed at how simply I could test the behaviour of my logic. 
 Does anybody know of any library in Haskell that can do similar things, or any ideas on how I may go about making one if not? I'm thinking Template Haskell or some AST-foo can maybe manage things.

 Coming mostly from imperative languages, never have I seen a typing system such as in Haskell, it quite literally blows my mind (in good but also in a headache way, but that is not Haskell's fault but just me being a beginner) but I should stop to digress.

 I have been looking into typeclasses and functors. Functors, both in a categorical sense and in Haskell. And there's just a burning question on my mind that I can't seem to get a clear answer about.

 But I still haven't learned more advanced stuff like Monads and Applicatives. I feel like it's going to take some time for me to learn these things and it makes me kind of discouraged because I'm still struggling to understand concepts like Funtors and Foldables. 
 How long did it take you to consider yourself good at haskell? How many hours did you study per week? (Did you study all your free time or just occasionally?)
 And by the way, how applicable are these more advanced concepts (Monads, Monoids, Applicative Functor, etc) in other programming languages?

 ``` twice f = f . f
 swap (x,y) = (y,x) ```
 The type of twice is infered to (a -> a) -> a -> a and swap is infered to (a,b) -> (b,a).
 If I write swap . swap the type of that expression is (a, b) -> (a, b).
 But if I ask for twice swap its type is (a, a) -> (a, a).
 I know that twice is restricting the type of swap. But I'm wondering if there is a way to write twice so that it accepts swap without restricting its type. That is, you can write twice swap and accept pairs where each component has a different type.
 The same happens with flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c, because twice flip :: (a -> a -> b) -> a -> a -> b.

 Now I can type /s to save the current buffer and I can type C-q / when I need to insert a literal /.
 But can I now make a key binding where / is a modifier key? For example, can I somehow get this to work?
 (global-unset-key (kbd "/")) (global-set-key (kbd "/-s") 'save-buffer) 
 This does not work for me of course. When I type /-s (press and hold /, press s, release /) I get this error,

 I see why this error happens. But is there anyway to make this work and treat / as a modifier key?

 So I recently completed setting up LSP for Haskell using Neovim and it's working great. But now I want to have the ability to also have LSP when my Haskell file is not in a stack project. For the instance I wanna write a small script or play around with some code.
 Is it possible to have LSP on a single Haskell file and if yes how would I accomplish it.
 If no what would be a good alternative for my use case? 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's an annoying question I've been facing for a while.
 ​
 Take this code sample:
 ​
 data Type1 = Con1 | Con2 | Con3 | Con4
 ​
 foo :: Type1 -> Maybe Type1
 foo bar = case bar of
 Con1 -> pure Con1
 Con2 -> pure Con2
 Con3 -> pure Con3
 Con4 -> pure Con4
 ​
 This isn't so complicated to clean up, is it?
 ​
 ​
 foo bar = pure $ case bar of
 Con1 -> Con1
 Con2 -> Con2
 Con3 -> Con3
 Con4 -> Con4
 ​
 There, now we've simplified this term slightly.
 ​
 Let's look at a different case:
 ​
 foo bar = case bar of
 Con1 -> Nothing
 Con2 -> Just Con2
 Con3 -> Just Con3
 Con4 -> Just Con4
 ​
 This isn't hard to fix either, if you think in terms of nested case expressions:
 ​
 foo bar = pure $ case bar of
 Con1 -> Nothing
 _ -> pure $ case bar of 
 Con2 -> Con2
 Con3 -> Con3
 Con4 -> Con4
 ​
 It's when you have wildcards comprising multiple elements that the real problem arises:
 ​
 foo bar = case bar of
 Con1 -> pure Con1
 Con2 -> pure Con2
 _ -> Nothing
 ​
 Now how do we remove this?
 ​
 I'm tilting toward supporting an idea of subcasing, but I'm not really sure how much Haskell code might need a revision to case syntax. In my (very limited) Haskell experience, pure ... comes up when working with Maybe, and if you want a wildcard pattern to catch everything you might have missed, there doesn't seem to be a solution other than typing everything out, or worse, adding a null type to your sum type.
 ​
 Subcasing would be adding x of... within a case expression, and creating a new case expression, but one to which x would be applied.
 ​
 An example:
 ​
 foo bar = case bar of
 pure of
 Con1 -> Con1
 Con2 -> Con2
 _ -> Nothing
 ​
 This would desugar, of course, to the example above.
 ​
 Is there any potential use case for this pattern? Or is there a better way to do the stuff mentioned above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am clojure programmer, and i like functional programming.
 I was thinking to learn scala also, mostly for job reasons,
 if i dont use clojure, to at least use scala and write functional code.
 Ideally mainly pure functions that call each others without classes etc.
 In clojure we have namespaces and top level functions inside.
 Can i do this in Scala i read that scala 3 allows top level definitions.
 I am asking if i can do something like the bellow, that would allow scala to
 looks like clojure, and not structure code in object-oriented way
 mynamespace1
 def f1(){...}
 def f2(){...}
 mynamespace2
 import mynamespace1
 mynamespace1.f1() 
 A simple solution would be to make a class and make all methods static,
 but i dont want this, i could do that in java also.
 Also does anyone using both scala and clojure?
 Can scala become "like" clojure?
 (i dont mean the s-expressions, at least in coding style)
 Scala and clojure interop is easy?

 Currently, this is what my workflow looks like:
 Windows and workspaces are not used. If I need a new window, I open another emacs client and manage it with my TWM. If I need a new workspace, I use the TWM workspaces. I use buffers as a way to have related tasks stacked on top of each other within one area, but this utility seems fairly limited.
 I doubt emacs would have these features if they aren't useful somehow, so what do they contribute to a workflow? In other words, how would incorporating them make me more productive and efficient compared to my current workflow?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

 ​
  
For example, we can prove that a × 1 = a by showing an isomorphism between (a, ()) and a.
  
​
 prodUnitTo :: a -> (a, ()) prodUnitTo a = (a, ()) 
 and
 prodUnitFrom :: (a, ()) -> a prodUnitFrom (a, ()) = a 
 It goes on to do the same with a + 0 = a being an isomorphism between Either a Void and a.
 sumUnitTo :: Either a Void -> a sumUnitTo (Left a) = a sumUnitTo (Right v) = absurd v sumUnitFrom :: a -> Either a Void sumUnitFrom = Left 
 Here () and Void are serving as monoidal identities with cardinality 1 and 0 respectively. I see the cardinality is the same -- which is the first requirement of isomorphisms -- but I'm not seeing how this proves anything -- except maybe in some category theory way I'm not yet familiar with. I'm still trying to wrap my brain around the whole sum type/disjoint set thing (See this previous discussion). I've seen unit () leveraged in Either a b, again, presumably because something of cardinality 1 and "non-reactive" is needed for a data constructor of constant value. In that post, it was for Nil. So, yes, what's the meaning of a proof like this through isomorphisms? What are we gaining with this? I got on this trail because I was still trying to grok the basic statement here about Either being the "canonical sum type." It goes on to do a recursive trick with Either to represent a sum type greater than two constructors
 data Trool = False | True | DontKnow type Trool = (Either () (Either () ())) -- i.e. Trool = 1 + (1 + 1) = 3 false :: Trool false = Left () true :: Trool true = Right (Left ()) dontKnow :: Trool dontKnow = Right (Right ()) 
 This again is leveraging unit and cardinality. And I guess it's also addressing the law of sums "pair-wise disjoint"? Any lore would be appreciated. Again, why is this proof?

 I test this via using the global-set-key command interactively and when I press H-d emacs shows s-d
 I do dual boot and used Xah's tutorial for setting up the app key as hyper in windows (link) and it works without issue. I'm not concerned with making super work in windows as I am working towards 100% linux usage.

Unfortunately, I need to types to work not with Double but with Num n => n. So the question is two-fold:
  
Do people know if there's a reason why Double is used in https://hackage.haskell.org/package/math-functions-0.3.4.2/docs/Numeric-SpecFunctions.html (which results in the quantile function for the normal distribution and others also being in terms of Double)
 
Is there a general solution to the problem of having a function defined on Double but wanting to abstract to a more general number type?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the past few months, I've used Emacs 28.1 (compiled from the official release tarball) with no apparent bugs. I've primarily used Debian Unstable, but I've also tried this on Fedora 36 and Arch. Changing from gcc11 to gcc12 doesn't change the situation.
 It seems that no matter what dependencies I install or which configuration options I provide, my compiled Emacs will never pass a handful of the tests provided by make check-all.
 Why is this the case? Has anyone managed to run 'make check-all' without any resulting failures, and if so, how? Are the failed tests in levels above 'make check' telling me anything significant?
 --Editing to fix formatting and (hopefully) simplify my question--
 Here's the result of running make check-all after compiling with the --with-xwidgets option:
 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS ----------------------- Files examined: 375 Ran 5568 tests, 1 failed to run, 5456 results as expected, 13 unexpected, 99 skipped 1 files did not finish: misc/test-custom-noloads.log 7 files contained unexpected results: src/thread-tests.log lisp/progmodes/python-tests.log lisp/mail/rmailmm-tests.log lisp/emacs-lisp/cconv-tests.log lisp/cedet/srecode/fields-tests.log lisp/cedet/srecode/document-tests.log lisp/autorevert-tests.log make[2]: *** [Makefile:336: check-doit] Error 2 make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/src/emacs/emacs-28.1-tarball/emacs-28.1/test' make[1]: *** [Makefile:315: check-all] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/src/emacs/emacs-28.1-tarball/emacs-28.1/test' make: *** [Makefile:994: check-all] Error 2 
 All the tests that fail are performed only when I run make check-all. They aren't run for make check or make check-expensive. I'll post more information in the comments shortly.

 which translated into
 orgmode * [2022-07-11 22:33]: My Beautiful Heading 
 So far so good. Now I have discovered the PROPERTIES. And I would like to save some TOC space, by turning the above into
 orgmode * My Beautiful Heading :PROPERTIES: :CREATED: [2022-07-11 22:33] :END: 
 I found here https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/72147/org-mode-adding-creation-date-property-upon-heading-creation a solution
 ```elisp (defun set-creation-date-heading-property () (org-set-property "CREATED:" (format-time-string "[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M]")))
 (defun my-org-mode-date-heading-on () "Turn on heading creation date property" (interactive) (add-hook 'org-insert-heading-hook #'set-creation-date-heading-property))
 (defun my-org-mode-date-heading-off () "Turn off heading creation date property" (interactive) (remove-hook 'org-insert-heading-hook #'set-creation-date-heading-property)) ```
 The problem it only works on a second heading. So I have to type * M-RET than remove the first heading.
 Can this be done on the creation of a new heading?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Disclaimer: I don't use emacs; I just have ulnar nerve entrapment from programming and discovered emacs pinky.)
 For the past 7 weeks, my pinky and ring finger have been in a constant state of "pins and needles." The onset was gradual but transitioned into being 24/7, though without pain at first. I thought it was from sleeping on my elbow - not an uncommon cause of ulnar nerve entrapment, and my doctor had me change sleeping positions. 
 I'm developing apps full time in dart and spend about 8-12 hours a day programming, 6-7 days a week. And I save, copy, paste, undo, redo, among other shortcuts all day, probably having my pinky hit the left ctrl key 1000 times a day. My typing speed was normally over 160, max 183, on 10fastfingers. 
 Look, I've rebinded left control entirely to left alt. But for some reason, it really hit me today. Suddenly, I was in so much pain that I couldn't bear to hit left ctrl. 
 I'm asking here because I'm hoping someone else has gone through recovery. I can't see a specialist for a couple of months. I'll discontinue using my small finger for shortcuts entirely, but that doesn't help me. I have a job to do now.

Sometimes I am in a mood that I am just not convenient to sit at my PC to write notes. So sitting into the couch, having a tea and just write some thoughts is the only way, I can motivate my self to writing.
I want to have my notes searchable. So the only thing I see, is to retype things at a later point of time.
Benefits: repetition and filtering
Any ideas/suggestions about this?

I am mostly interested in programming language design or anything that involves concurrency however, it is unclear for me if Scala is practical in the former. My list right now looks as follows:
  
A wrapper around the Notion API, to send/receive notes.
 A small programming language, crafting interpreters seems convenient for this case.
  
I would deeply appreciate any further suggestion. Thanks in advance!

 Curious how everyone is using tags vs nodes in org roam or other backlinking systems. 
 I don’t have a good strategy right now. If I think I might need to add my own thoughts, I add a note. So my system is mostly nodes right now with a scattering of tags. 
 So for instance I ended up with a node “movies” and a tag “movies”. 
 Kinda messy. What have you found to work for you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a project with a fairly pipeline-y design. Each function in the pipeline is responsible for doing a small task, but certain parts might generate errors (Either String) mutate various forms of state, and in general may require more monad transformers all composed on top of each other.
 At first I thought it would be smart to separate it to little transformers, each one responsible for a specific behavior, and that allows each function opt in to only the behaviors it really needs. But this turns out to be awful when I want to pipeline two functions with a different monad tower, so for example with StateT I need to unpack the state and repack it at a different level.
 Is there a cleaner/more idiomatic way to approach this that I'm unaware of? Should I just have one uniform monad for all the functions? I think that's what I'm gonna have to do for now, but I'd appreciate hearing more insights.

 I am setting up my stack config.yaml file. There is a template parameter option for github-username but there doesn't seem to be a GitLab equivalent gitlab-username. 
 For the short term I can use my old GitHub account, but I recently ported the majority of my projects to GitLab and would hate to have projects split between GitLab & GitHub. Plus I know if I don't configure tools properly now, I will never do it... 
 How can I configure Stack to use GitLab rather than GitHub for user non-project defaults in ~/stack/config.yaml?
 BUT... I am new and should probably focus on learning Haskell rather than fighting tools to get a "janky" workaround for gitlab. If the solution is too cumbersome then I'll switch back to GitHub, instead.
 Thanks in advance for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like the compiler (EDIT: the type checker) to enforce that only values from the "cloned type" will be accepted by functions that have it at its type signature. 
 So, just using the keyword type to assing an extra name is not suitable as it unfortunately is equivalent to the original type in all aspects.
 Examples of what doesn't work for my needs:
 type Code = Int
 newtype Code = Code Int
 The purpose is to achieve the same goal of creating aliases with type: make explicit the meaning of the intended values. The difference is that the usage of values of the "cloned type" would actually be made mandatory by the compiler (EDIT: by the type checker). The type signature shouldn't accept an Int in the place of Code, for instance:
 f :: Code -> String
 Another way to put the question is: 
 How can I add my own type to the special group of types that have integer literals as their values?
 The source code for Int is cryptic:
 data {-# CTYPE "HsInt" #-} Int = I# Int#
 I'm using Int here just as an example, but it could be [Char].
 ==== EDIT ====
 Disambiguation using (42 :: Code) won't be necessary when applying f.
 Although relevant in some contexts, I'm not concerned about runtime representation. The question is just about how to use literals (e.g. string or Int) directly as values of my type, i. e. without having to prepend each literal with a constructor. Exactly how we use type aliases over existing types, except by the fact that they shouldn't be interchangeable. Only when using literals they will appear the same: Instead of writing f $ Code 123, one would write f 123. Instead of writing g $ Name "John", one would write g "John". The difference will emerge when type-checking a comparison of two variables, or when type-checking the return value of a function application, etc.

It pretty much always appears super tiny to the point where my image viewer won't even zoom in for me. I mean I know they're scalable but I don't understand the default size.
 This example that I got from the docs seems to have much thicker lines around the rectangles than the output in the docs and also the letters are not at all inside the rectangles as they should be.
 ​
 #!/usr/bin/env stack 
 -- stack --resolver lts-19.0 script
 import Diagrams.Prelude import Diagrams.Backend.SVG.CmdLine import Diagrams.TwoD.Text
 eff = (text "F" <> square 1) # fontSize (local 1)
 example :: Diagram B example = hcat [eff, eff # scale 2, eff # scaleX 2, eff # scaleY 2, eff # rotateBy (1/12)]
 main = mainWith example

 This is a PNG screenshot of my resulting SVG image. I'm hoping to make SVG images with Diagrams. Also I added all of the driver code my self. The imports, mainWith, the type declaration on example which was required to avoid an ambiguous type. Any of that might be misuse on my part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I have a question about proper usage of Ref:
 Where other languages mutate objects, FP-languages prefer creating alternative instances to preserve referential transparency. Let's say I have a nested structure, i.e. House has Floors, Floor has Apartment, Apartment has Room, Room has LightBulb. If I change a light bulb, I obviously don't want to recreate the whole House.
 The way documentation describes Ref, its' primary goal is to help with concurrency:
  
An asynchronous, concurrent mutable reference. Provides safe concurrent access and modification of its content
  
But from my experience, it's really handy to use it just as a reference, even if there are no troubles with concurrency. In the example with House I can store references to Apartments to avoid recreating Floors and the whole House each time i have a change in an Apartment. I can just call apartmentRef.update(...) and the Floor and the House stay exactly the same.
 The question is: is it OK to do so? If so, is it bad to use it every time, let's say at each level mentioned in the House example?

 Some clarification on what I mean by the title and where I'm coming from: in general I don't think any one language is "the best," but for most languages, I can point to some aspects that it excels at, and that make it a better option than others depending on the situation. For example, if someone has no experience in programming and wants to start learning by writing working code quickly, I'd recommend Python for its readability and (apparent) simplicity.
 I've recently started learning Scala out of an interest in functional programming and how it is accomplished in languages running on the JVM. There are some aspects I really like, like the use of Option instead of Null, the fact that the syntax is familiar but 'cleaned-up' and less verbose compared to Java, performance …]]></summary>

 I'm using the scala 2 sbt template just to check out the highlighting. I've ran the doctor and it tells me that there are issues, but I'm boggled at what I need to look at. I've disable all other extensions.
 It's crazy to think that metals would not run on Code-OSS, but I think that the issue is just on my side. 
 I've attached some pictures, I've followed the instructions in the metals docs, can someone tell me what to look at?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The amazing flexibility of org-mode made me think of new ways of employing it to organize my day.
 So I have things to do at a certain date, and their place is clearly in the calendar, to show up for the day. Maybe an advanced warning, a couple of days before.
 Than I have things that I have to get done, but they are not anchored to some date, so they get into the TODO.
 So far so good. How about items that are IN WAITING. Say I request I have to repeat if there is no answer. Or a refund request? Or anything that doesn't neatly fit into either of the above.
 How would you handle these indefinite tasks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just watched this video by Richard Eisenberg, who says that automatic eta expansion is bad because it changes program semantics, giving the example that:
 map (\x -> f (fib 25) x) [1, 2, 3] 
 performs much worse than
 map (f (fib 25)) [1, 2, 3] 
 But isn't a better eta expansion of the latter simply the following?
 map (let tmp = fib 25 in \x -> f tmp x) [1, 2, 3] 
 This way no sharing is lost. And I think the semantics is preserved. So doesn't this solve the problem?
 Maybe there are more problems with eta expansion for deep subsumption than shown in the video, though.

From my (cursory) tests of the package knob-0.2, it seems that in order to allow the user to pass such a wrapper to standard library functions like System.IO.hGetLine is suffices to provide BufferedIO, IODevice and RawIO, but, as pointed out in this SO thread (see this comment), this alone will not enable me to ever redirect any of the three 'std' streams to a knob-backed handle by means of a call to GHC.IO.Handle.hDuplicateTo because hDuplicateTo can only operate on handles referencing devices of the same type―the code listed in the comment linked above fails with "illegal operation" because the type of the device associated with the handle h (in terms of Data.Typeable.typeOf) is Data.Knob.Device (see https://hackage.haskell.org/package/knob-0.2/docs/src/Data.Knob.html#Device) and stdout is backed by a regular file descriptor (FD). Is there any way to circumvent this without modifying GHC?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using line-prefix to give a little bit of space between the line numbers enabled by display-line-numbers-mode and my code, but it causes the unfortunate issue of the first tab being "shortened" by a space.
 This is because, when you enter a tab in emacs, the tab inserts space to the "tab stop" (not the tab stop set by tab-stop-list, but some kind of internal rendering value), and the space added by line-prefix doesn't move the internal tab stops, just adds a space at the beginning of the line, so it's the same as if you entered a space then a tab -- your indentation level is still only tab-width deep.
 I'm happy to just use spaces for indentation for my personal projects, but when collaborating with others I'll have to use tabs in some cases, so I'd like to find a solution to this problem. I've tried setting line-prefix to a tab, but even with tab-width 2, that's a bit too much.
 Alternatively, I'm happy with any other way to add a space between the display-line-numbers section and my code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have several inbox locations, and use an agenda view to list all headings that I need to process during my weekly review.
 Part of this process is re-filing stuff I captured during different points in the week. For this I use bulk remote editing agenda commands (m to select multiple headings, then B and r to refile). This works very well.
 The only issue I have is that the agenda is rebuild after each (bulk) refile, which takes a while (10~15 seconds every time). It does take long but not forever, but it is already annoying although I am rather new to org and my files are not that large.
 Is there an option/command/prefix/hack I am missing that allows me to prevent the rebuild of the agenda every time?
 As plan B, is there another/better way to refile several entries at the same time that does not involve agendas?
 ---
 I noticed that the agenda is not re-build when I archive a heading (using a in the agenda view). I guess this is because the command predictably removes the heading from the agenda. Since my refiles are also doing that, this is in theory similar.
 ---
 I found this thread in which I learned that
  
If you give a triple prefix argument to org-agenda-refile, the agenda will not be rebuilt.
  
Which is great, and good to know, but does not help me, since I want to keep using bulk actions.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was trying to get into Haskell a few days ago. Installed VS Code, Haskell (through ghcup, including HLS and so on), created a new project using
 stack new website yesodweb/sqlite
 Everything fine so far. Opened up VS Code, waited for GHC installation and so on.
 But when I try to use features like showing me function definitions or the type of my own defined functions nothing happens. I looked into the logs, the Haskell extension complains it can't determine reverse dependencies? Very helpfull error message.
 So I go look it up, aha, stack and HLS don't like each other, I am supposed to use cabal instead. But. No meantion on how to convert a "stack project" properly. So I deleted .stack-work and the stack.yaml stuff. Still not working.
 Like, come on. Haskell has a steep learning curve as is. It's hard for people to get started. Shouldn't there at least be a little focus on making shit work, so that people that want to get started don't just turn their back because it's not even straight forward to get started editing files?
 Does someone have a single website, works as is guide about setting up some editor for proper support (VS code preferred)? I'm one Google search away from going back to another language. It's just frustrating.

 in a textbook and can't figure out what's actually happening. AFAIK, a Haskell list comprehension seems to be sort of a Cartesian product machine -- at least when there are two generators; e.g., if you give it [(x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [1,2]] , it "magically" knows to give you back the Cartesian product [(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)] -- or it somehow just knows to treat this as a nested loop and build tuples. So with the original example, somehow each of the elements of [1,2,3] is being "crossed" with False, right? Or is something else going on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using org-wild-notifier (within Spacemacs) for a while and I realized it was actually draining my laptop batter quite a bit. The core reason is that once a minute it spawns a separate emacs instance that has to initialize a bunch of things and actually (re)open all org agenda files I already had opened and regenerate org-agenda.
 Which led me to dig around and look at https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async (which wild-notifier uses) and then read a bit about https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NoThreading.
 I also went through https://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html a bit (I only have a few agenda files and they are not huge, though I am toying with the idea of testing cleanup to see how much it would help)
 Ultimately though, it feel like the emacs-async use in this case will always cause slowdowns. Doing some profiling - even the call to package-initialize in org-wild-notifier--retrieve-events takes a sizeable chunk of CPU.
 These seem like wasted cycles, my emacs instance already has the org files open and all the packages needed loaded.
 So, finally my question is - am I the only one that is bothered by this? Do people not want/need notifications generally? Or not get hit by the battery drain for some reason? How do others deal with getting notifications before events/tasks are scheduled/planned?
 I looked a bit at https://github.com/legalnonsense/org-timed-alerts and I like the approach using org-ql potentially nice(r). Especially with caching and all of that... But the package doesn't seem maintained anymore so I think it's a dead end?
 Alternatively would changing wild-notifier to use emacs threads potentially solve/improve this? (at the cost of newer emacs version requirement).
 Any other suggestions (other than trying to cleanup my org agenda files)?
 Edit: Fix double spaced-paragraphs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am putting together an announcement for the "Programming in Haskell" course that we are restarting on my alma mater after a couple years of pause, and I was looking to refresh the list of motivating materials that should convince the reader that it is worth learning Haskell, but I had a bit of trouble finding relatively new materials. Therefore, I would appreciate any suggestions!
 Here are the materials we have so far in the announcement :
  
We suggest you start by watching this video: 
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqi0Xu2Enaw 
 Then have a look at these posts and discussions: 
 https://serokell.io/blog/10-reasons-to-use-haskell 
 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/775726/whats-the-fuss-about 
 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3175656/why-should-i-want-to-learn-haskell 
 If you want to know more about the basic motivation behind Haskell and functional programming in general, listen to what the founding fathers of Haskell have to say: 
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSmkqocn0oQ
  
Video in the first link is great content-wise, but it feels and looks really old, so I don't think it leaves great impression on young students.
 Serokell blog post is great, I think, new and concise, I am happy with that one.
 Stack overflow discussions are motivating and inspiring, but both are almost 10 years old.
 Last video is nice, but also dated.
 Ideally, finding a replacement video for the first one, but newer, would be great, and possibly some newer discussions / blog posts!

 I'm what we could call a heavy-power-user of Notion (and Anytype in a certain way, as an alpha user of the app). 
 Both of these apps use an object-is-a-note oriented approach, meaning that each new note created can be referenced in other notes, creating a network of notes (or thoughts, depending on how you see it). Notion implements this (in a convoluted manner, IMHO) with what they call "databases", which is a table view of all objects of a certain type (i.e.: all note of type "Human" are contained in the database "Humans"). I really like this type of atomic implementation because it makes the process of creating new notes and working on existing notes quite straight-foward (simple workflow = easier maintenance of the system).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a beginner with Megaparsec and Haskell in general, and trying to write a parser for the following grammar:
  
A word will always be one of:
  
 A number composed of one or more ASCII digits (ie "0" or "1234") OR
 A simple word composed of one or more ASCII letters (ie "a" or "they") OR
 A contraction of two simple words joined by a single apostrophe (ie "it's" or "they're")
  
So far, I've got the following (this can probably be simplified):
 data Word = Number String | SimpleWord String | Contraction String deriving (Show) word :: Parser MyParser.Word word = M.choice [ Number <$> number , Contraction <$> contraction , SimpleWord <$> simpleWord ] number :: Parser String number = M.some C.numberChar simpleWord :: Parser String simpleWord = M.some C.letterChar contraction :: Parser String contraction = do left <- simpleWord void $ C.char '\'' right <- simpleWord return (left ++ "'" ++ right) 
 But I'm having problem with defining a parser for skipping white spaces and anything that is non-alphanumeric. For example, given the input 'abc', the parser should discard the apostrophes and just take the "simple word".
 The following doesn't compile:
 filler :: Parser Char filler = M.some (C.spaceChar A.<|> not C.alphaNumChar) spaceConsumer :: Parser () spaceConsumer = L.space filler A.empty A.empty lexeme :: Parser a -> Parser a lexeme = L.lexeme spaceConsumer

 We run some (legacy) services which use akka-http and wanted to get all those nice features that distributed tracing gives, such as continuations and so on.
 We are migrating the services to use tapir instead of the akka-http dsl, which makes tracing much easier from my point of view.
 The project is still in a very preliminary stage, despite we use it in production and it's working.
 Thanks for any feedback!

 But why is it 0.125? What is the purpose of this delay?
 I realize that I find it more comfortable to type Elisp code when its value is set to 0 and that makes me wonder if there is a reason for it to have 0.125 by default.

 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c uni") (lambda () (interactive) (insert "universe"))) 
 Now if I press C-c and type uni, the word universe is inserted to the buffer.
 But this key binding does not work:
 (global-set-key (kbd ":uni") (lambda () (interactive) (insert "universe"))) 
 If I compile this, I get error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Key sequence : u n i starts with non-prefix key :") 
 How can I make a successful key binding for :uni?
 Yes, I know this is going to interfere with typing literal : in the text and I find with that for now because I am still learning what is possible and what is not possible.

 ## $DATE $TIME My wonderful heading
 When it comes to a table of contents, the time stamp takes space, and is irrelevant, yet I want to have it, I want to know at what time I started writing that, maybe how long it took.
 With orgmode I have the chance of having a drawer with the note and its heading. And probably there are other ways I am not aware of to store a time stamp.
 How would you do? In a way that will satisfy all conditions - get the time stamp out of the way - still know when the note was taken - get the agenda anchor for the note

 Should I rely on searching tools when I re-watch a film and want to add some more data?
 Or it would be more practical to have an index file, with a lot of headings, each a link to the actual file with the review?
 I guess book reviews would be the same only a different folder / index. How do you handle this sort of case, with many files?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started out with IMDB. And it was okay. But I want my data. And probably I should be publishing it as a personal blog or something. 
 The current structure is pretty much a YAML heading like this:
 ```yaml
 title : L'art dans le sang (2021) year : 2021 name : francais : L'art dans le sang english : Affairs of the Art date : 2022-03-29 14:04 language : url : - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGk0KBWew58 - https://letterboxd.com/film/affairs-of-the-art/ - https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/742843/
  - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt14293560/
 The actual review / notes. ```
 Nothing fancy.
 How do I fit this data in an org file?
 Should it be a drawer?
 Should it be a YAML block?
 Is there a text database in orgmode, where I can fit these fields?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the great things about Zotero is the set of Zotero translators that is there and is being maintained. Basically for any website, e.g. arxiv.org, there is a translator that describes how to get the bibliographic data from the url. I wanted to use these translators in my Emacs setup and I came across Zotero translation server. So I wrote a few functions to bridge between the translation server and Emacs.
 Now I have a bookmark in my browser that I can click to automatically export the bibtex citation of the webpage to my default bib file, basically like a Zotero connector for Emacs. Thought this might be useful for others, so here it is:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a document that I want to add a border to for my PDF export which is done with 
 ```
 +BEGIN_EXPORT latex
 \tcbox{\includegraphics[width=13cm]{./Pictures/picture1.png}}
 +END_EXPORT
 `` For HTML I just have a regular[[./Pictures/picture1.png]]` which works just fine and I edit it with a CSS file. 
 When I export to HTML there isn't a problem because the LATEX code doesn't show up on the HTML page. When I export to PDF/Latex though, the image shows up twice. Once without borders and once with. What I am looking to do is set this up so that I can export the same document to PDF, and HTML without having to edit one of those files. 
 Right now I am editing the given Latex file to get rid of the excess picture. 
 I read the manual and saw the #+ATTR_LATEX: which I could put before the image but couldn't figure out how to get the frame around the photo with that. Thoughts?
 Also, I tried adding code to get the image for HTML only which I figured would solve my problem but that code shows up in the HTML, and Latex export.
 Edit: Found my answer! ```
 +LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[most]{tcolorbox}
 +LATEX_HEADER: \let\includegraphicsold\includegraphics
 +LATEX_HEADER: \renewcommand{\includegraphics}[2][]{\tcbox{\includegraphicsold[#1]{#2}}}
 ``` That way the default images act in the way I had with the code above! I just had to put that at the top of my file.

I'm learning scala and to be more acurate and honest Go and Scala (started second time and boom it's exam time again, seems like I'll start third time) and JS and my goal is backend. I know I would have to move to scala js, but not regular scala. That's fine. Okay, I know this question maybe subjective, and most people won't like it. Please be kind, I request. 
 What after learning scala? Something more important that this, approximately, how much scala is enough to move towards my goal? Scala learning resources are really less. I know noone is gonna suggest me to do take go and scala as first languages. But I'm in love with them, trust me. Please guide me the path. I'll be thankful.

I know how to do that (or I think I do), but what I would like is to make the name of every .md file into a heading in the big org file. For example, if i have three files named introduction.md, development.md and ending.md, I would like to have this in the merged org file: 
  
introduction.md
 
 (contents of the file) 
  
developement.md

ending.md
 
 (contents of the file) 
 And being able to fold them as in any org file.
 Is this possible?

As nice as it would be to clean up the formatting, right now I'm just trying to get it to work, and it messes up my workflow to have tons of newlines added every time I add a closing bracket. Here's a gif of what I'm talking about:
 https://i.redd.it/xai1fe7c7v991.gif
 How can I disable this behavior?
 ​
 Edit: further testing seems to indicate that this is caused by the language server (ccls). If I disable lsp-managed-mode, the behavior stops. Also, if I leave lsp-managed-mode enabled and wrap the statement in #if false ... #endif, the line breaks aren't added either. Still not sure if there's a way to disable just this function without disabling the language server altogether.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m investing the plausibility of a testing for an “app” that is basically a complicated ETL process. 
 The “architecture” of this app: all of my external state is memoized in this DataAccess class, which provides functions to access different sets of data. Each function returns a sequence of case classes representing the data source that has been fetched from the database. 
 The “half baked idea” is: What if “whenever something interesting happens” I could deserialize this DataAccess class and replay the test data through the latest version of the app for debugging and testing purposes. 
 Does anyone have any kind of experience with such a pattern? What tools did you consider to help with the “snapshotting” (serialization and deserialization)? Where did you persist your snapshots?
 Some considerations: 1. There are about a hundred different case classes available through various functions in the DataAccess class 2. The “amount” of data is large. So while I view storage cost as essentially free, serialization / deserialization performance (primarily deserialization) is a concern
 A few options I could think of are: 1. A database, either a “real database” or perhaps some kind of in-memory database 2. Serializing to disk storage on some server in ProtoBuf, Mempack, Csv, json etc. 3. ???

 Wondering if anyone's using Emacs for incremental reading. It's sort of like using spaced repetition for progressively getting through challenging content. Much more on supermemo wiki: https://www.supermemo.wiki/en/learning/incremental-reading
 To facilitate incremental reading in Emacs I'm trying org-noter which is amazing but sadly hasn't been maintained in recent years.
 There's also annotate.el which Im going to try.
  
Is anyone using emacs/orgmode for incremental reading?
 Are there any other annotation packages that I'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent some time this weekend writing up an alpha version of some ideas I had about command line option parsing as a haskell package: cyclops.
 To start, if you're looking for a robust and full-featured option parser, cyclops isn't that yet. Let me recommend optparse-applicative and optparse-generic, which are both great.
 The Big Idea of cyclops is to support a declarative option-parsing style (just say what arguments you expect, rather than how to parse it) while keeping the option description as close as possible to the variable bind location.
 To that end, it uses ViewPatterns and TypeApplications with DataKinds to pass option specifications backwards from the bind location using type inference.
 main = do ( switch @'["d", "debug"] @"Show debugging statements" -> debug ,flagged @'["dictionary"] @"PATH" @"File to draw words from" .defaultTo @"--dictionary /usr/share/dict/words" -> dictionaryPath ,option @'["s", "seed"] @"NUM" @"Seed value for PRNG" .readable -> seed ,arg @"count" @"Number of passwords to generate" .readable -> count ,arg @"template" @"Template for generated passwords" .oneOrMore .defaultTo @"w w w w" -> template ) <- getOps Conf { description = "Generate pseudorandom passwords using a template." , version = "1.0.0.20220702" } 
 Type inference places some constraints not visible in the above example code - if seed is inferred to be an Int by how it's used in the rest of the code, then that's how it getOps will attempt to parse --option 123.
 This release isn't really ready for primetime yet, but if you like the basic concept, let me know, and I'll keep working it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! So I am receiving a ByteString for which I know TextEncoding, and I would like to decode it into Text. I see that TextEncoding has mkTextDecoder field, but I haven't managed so far to figure out how to construct the correct types to use it -> any help is welcome!
 So ideally, I wold like to implement following function: hs decodeEncoding :: TextEncoding -> ByteString -> IO Text 
 I got this far: ```hs decodeEncoding :: TextEncoding -> ByteString -> IO Text decodeEncoding E.TextEncoding{ E.mkTextDecoder = mkDecoder } bs = do
 -- Cheat sheet: -- - mkTextDecoder :: IO (TextDecoder dstate) -- - type TextDecoder state = BufferCodec Word8 Char state -- - encode :: BufferCodec -> CodeBuffer from to -- - type CodeBuffer from to -- = Buffer from -- -> Buffer to -- -> IO (CodingProgress, Buffer from, Buffer to) decoder <- mkDecoder let from = error "I don't know how to construct this Buffer from the bytestring" let to = error "I don't know how to initialize this Buffer" (progress, from', to') <- E.encode (decoder enc) from to return to' -- I don't know how to transform to' from Buffer into Text. 
 ```
 Thanks!

Given a number, find the sum of all the unique multiples of particular numbers up to but not including that number. 
 If we list all the natural numbers below 20 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18. 
 The sum of these multiples is 78.
  
I've a solution previously written in Rust that I now want to convert to Haskell. The solution uses Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all the factors of a given number. The implementation uses a binary heap.
 In Haskell, this is turning out to be an incredibly frustrating problem to solve because of the state to be maintained, and various conditional actions to be taken depending on the state.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am trying to figure out a good workflow for Emacs + ESS for R. For interactive data analysis it's nice to make a lot of plots and RStudio has a nice panel for these. But ESS, at least by default, uses X, which is not nice:
 - plotting happens in the XQuartz application, which means that I need to switch out of Emacs and requires a whole bunch of keypresses and thought that I don't want to deal with; at most a window (or multiple as appropriate) should open which I close it with cmd-w and return to emacs, without having to switch applications.
 - plots aren't interactive. In python, for example, you can adjust the plot and save it from the figure window (although the plot window also switches apps and for that reason is not ideal).
 Is this the standard R plotting workflow on macOS (or for that matter Linux)? How do people handle making a lot of plots, on the fly, using ESS? Any other related workflow tips are also helpful. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, after intensive testing i just released my first library on hackage!
 Interval Tree Clocks - They serve as an alternative to vector clocks, which are a concept to track logical time. In distributed contexts, comparison by timestamps might be skewed. 
 Vector clocks and version vectors however have the weakness of "actor explosion" because you cannot remove traces of an actor that might be long gone. They only allow you to increment the version vector in length.
 Interval tree clocks solve this by managing a tree-representation of said vector clock. With interval tree clocks you can dynamically add (fork) or remove (join) actors / replicas from your system and have your versions grow and shrink accordingly, while still holding the monotonically increasing semantics.
 They can similarly be used as either version vectors or vector clocks.
 I have thoroughly tested the code. Nonetheless if you are an expert on the topic, I'd love to get your criticism. Nevertheless, because it's my first library, I appreciate all and any feedback I can get.
 Hope this helps you build distributed systems some day!

 I'm learning Haskell by doing the 2016 Advent of Code with it, and I have a few common functions I use nearly every 'day', so I wrote a Common.hs file, starting with:
 moudule Common ( takeUntil , dropUntil , linesToList ) where 
 When I try to import it, however, ghc gives me this error:
 Common.hs:1:1: error: File name does not match module name: Saw: ‘Main’ Expected: ‘Common’ | 1 | moudule Common | ^ 
 From what I've seen online, this is the correct way to do it.
 Looking it up only yielded "check your formatting", which I certainly did.
 What am I doing wrong?

 :weekly_template: HABIT TRACKER ============ M T W T F S S Meditation [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Yoga [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Exercise [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] MIT's (Most Important Tasks) ========================= • [ ] 8 hours of hobby work • [ ] 5 hours of reading • [ ] 12 hours of content creation (videos, posts, texts) • [ ] etc Tasks (TODOs) =========== • [ ] Task 1 • [ ] Task 2 • [ ] Task 3 • [ ] Task 4 • [ ] Task 5 :end: 
 I am wondering how I can set up time-tracking for those MIT's that include hourly metric. If there was a way to start-stop a time counter manually on a given MIT and also see the total time accumulated on that activity, then that could work. I shall appreciate any other suggestions as well.

 import time for i in range(10): time.sleep(0.5) print(i, end="\r") 
 to my python interpreter, I would like to see in "buf-out" the sequence of numbers from 0 to 9 overwrite each other every half-second. Essentially, I want to see in "buf-out" exactly what I would see in the shell after pressing RET. Is there a way to do this? I tried with comint-redirect but it does not interpret the carriage return, and it also displays the ">>>" prompt that gets printed after the code finishes running.

This throws my total effort and clock-in estimates off as I get my tasks done throughout the day, because it adds them repeatedly for the same task. Is there any way to make sure these items only appear once?

 I can't seem to search from stackage/hackage packages anymore. When I input a search it adds a filter for haskell-platform which evidently only includes libraries shipped with GHC. I don't see a way to remove this filter; even if I remove &scope=set%3Ahaskell-platform from the URI it doesn't work.
 For example, my query for lookupGetParam in Yesod doesn't work: link.
 Was there some change to Hoogle? Am I doing my queries wrong (they worked before)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a strange problem with my org-agenda, the view for TODO items in particular.
 I have set
 ```
 ((setq org-directory "~/org")
 (setq org-agenda-files "~/org/agenda")
 ```
 Now, I have several files in the folder ~/org/agenda. Namely inbox.org with items from my cellphone using beorg and personal-cal.org and personal-caldav-inbox.org.
 When I put a new first level heading into personal-cal.org or personal-caldav-inbox.org, and tag it with TODO, the items appears in the org-agenda TODO list. When I put the same heading into inbox.org (or any other file I added for testing) it does not.
 I also tried to copy personal-cal.org and put the TODO item in the copy, still it does not appear. So it does not seem to be something inside the files that make them special, it is rather that I somehow set up emacs to only look inside those two files for TODO items.
 But how? The only time I even mention those two files in my config is in the config for caldav:
 ```
 (setq org-caldav-calendars
 '((:calendar-id "personal" :files ("~/org/agenda/personal-cal.org")
 :inbox "~/org/agenda/personal-caldav-inbox.org")
 )
 )
 ```
 I commented those two lines but this does not change anything for the TODO list.

 // nevermind, I found it

 stack install --ghc-options "-optl-static -fPIC" 
 I get a bunch of warnings in the shape of:
 statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking 
 The build ends up fine, but then when running the executable from a container it fails to connect to sibling container (all run from docker-compose), issuing errors of the likes of: 
 Network.Socket.getAddrInfo (called with preferred socket type/protocol: AddrInfo {addrFlags = [AI_ADDRCONFIG,AI_NUMERICHOST,AI_PASSIVE], addrFamily = AF_UNSPEC, addrSocketType = Datagram, addrProtocol = 0, addrAddress = 0.0.0.0:0, addrCanonName = Nothing}, host name: Just "10.89.0.1", service name: Just "domain"): does not exist (Servname not supported for ai_socktype) 
 Any idea how I can either successfully link the aforementioned glibc libraries at build time or at least depend on the runtime in the way expected by the executable? First time I get my hands on static build, sorry if the question comes off naive.

On Mac
 Using Stack
 Working on a preprocessor/plugin that I'm dogfeeding in the same test suite (can try reproing by cloning: https://github.com/brandonchinn178/tasty-autocollect)
  
When I run stack purge and then run stack test multiple times consecutively, it doesnt rebuild, as expected. But then if I make a change and run stack test multiple times, itll rebuild the first time as expected, but then rebuild the entire test suite every subsequent time as well.
 When diffing the dylib in between each run (with otool -l) the only thing that changes is the timestamp. 1. Why does stack (or ghc) introduce a dependency on a dylib? 2. Is this a stack or ghc thing? If I were to ticket upstream, which project should I ticket with? 3. Why does the dylib not change the first time, but change every time after the first change?

 I know the MVC pattern from frameworks like laravel in php. Is this pattern also used in functional programming? If so, do you also call "services" in your controllers? So the only difference is handling business logic in a functional way?
 Do you have any book recommendations for beginners on something like "functional architectures"/ "functional design patterns"? (any language is okay, I just want to get a basic grasp of it).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started exploring Haskell because the idea of pure functional programming seemed quite exciting. I wanted to see what paradigms I would have to use to create proper Haskell code. I was thinking it might help me get out of the Object-Oriented bubble, and maybe become a better programmer in general.
 I have some doubts from what I saw till now:
 - The idea of **modules** seems similar to classes in C++. Where the exposed functions are publically available and rest are not. Isn't this an object-oriented feature?
 - Which tutorials/books would you recommend?
 - My final target is to be able to create a application/project using Haskell. Which type of applications are best suited for Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using a phantom type to distinguish between data that's undergone some form of normalization from data that has not. A simplified example:
 data Normalized data Denormalized class Normalize x where type Normalization x normalize :: x -> Normalization x -- 'Foo' uses phantom type n to track whether normalization has been applied. data Foo n = Foo String -- Normalizing a 'Foo' that has already been 'Normalized' is a no-op. instance Normalize (Foo Normalized) where type Normalization (Foo Normalized) = Foo Normalized normalize = id -- Normalizing a 'Foo' that has not already been normalized transforms the String. instance Normalize (Foo Denormalized) where type Normalization (Foo Denormalized) = Foo Normalized normalize (Foo s) = Foo (map toUpper s) -- A smart constructor produces a 'Foo' with no normalization applied mkFoo :: String -> Foo Denormalized mkFoo = Foo 
 By exporting mkFoo but not the Foo data constructor, I can prevent users of this library from manually constructing a value of type Foo Normalized. Instead, they're forced to do something like:
 normalize (mkFoo "x") 
 However, it seems they could still circumvent normalization via coerce:
 coerce (mkFoo "x") :: Foo Normalized 
 The documentation for Coercible seems to suggest this should not be the case, given that the Foo data constructor is not in scope, but playing around with it in ghci I'm finding I can perform this undesirable coercion.
 For now, I've added a type role annotation to prevent such coercion,
 type role Foo nominal 
 but I'm curious to know why coerce is working otherwise, despite the fact that the Foo data constructor is not in scope. (Also curious to know if there's a cleaner way to implement this whole thing in general.)

 I would like to use Emacs for writing Turtle and since ttl-mode is a bit basic, I'd like to give LSP/turtle-language-server a try.
 I have lsp-mode and lsp-ui up and running, which works reasonably fine for the languages with built-in support in lsp-mode.
 However turtle-language-server is not initially supported by lsp-mode, so how do I manually connect the language server with lsp-mode? 
 (The message I get from lsp-mode says to look at lsp-java/lsp-metals for examples of manual setup, but I think this is deprecated)

 https://github.com/tersesystems/echopraxia-plusscala
 There's a couple of neat features in it which I think will be of interest from a Scala perspective -- there's nothing groundbreaking, but whenever anything goes unexpectedly right I like to make a note of it.
 The first is that implicits are relative to a field builder, a factory defined on the logger, and that field builder is an input to a function that builds the argument for the logging statement:
 trait SomeFieldBuilder extends FieldBuilder { implicit val fooToValue: ToValue[Foo] = ... } object SomeFieldBuilder extends SomeFieldBuilder val logger: Logger[SomeFieldBuilder] = LoggerFactory.getLogger.withFieldBuilder(SomeFieldBuilder) val myFoo: Foo = ... logger.…]]></summary>

Find out what function causes the prompt to appear?
 Get a stack trace when that function is called?

 Deleting the file is easy, but of course emacs recreates #shell# for me. How can I remove the association from buffer to the file, turning it back into a file-less shell buffer? 
 I've found searching for this leads only suggestions to kill the buffer (sure, but there has to be a better way) or very basic how-to for file and buffer deletion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw the other day this initiative Give Up Github. I think it makes sense for open source or free source communities to think about their continued usage of Github. 
 I won't repeat the article but just mention Copilot, the AI code completion tool that was trained on many public projects on Github and as of last week, became a commercial, for-profit product. There is no license attribution, there is no legal precedence, there is no public dataset release (which means we don't know how many or what projects were used) and there is the small percentage of cases in which verbatim code is generated. 
 I realize how Github is central for my FOSS projects. In a sense, Github is a walled garden, enjoying a huge network effect. It will take an effort to move to other solutions. Personally, I'm going to try SourceHut, I think it's very promising.
 What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Today, I discovered a function of IntelliJ: "Move refactoring" (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/move-refactorings.html#move_refactoring).
 In Golang for example, moving a folder inside a project will automatically update all reference to the package and modify all the necessary imports.
 Researching a bit, I found out this is probably a function of the LSP server. I found lsp-rename which allow renaming a function in the whole project but I couldn't find equivalent to the "Move refactoring" function of IntelliJ, which would allow moving a folder in one go.
 Is there anyway to achieve this in Emacs?
 Thank you!

 https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/
  
from the google page:
 Repo is a tool built on top of Git. Repo helps manage many Git repositories, does the uploads to revision control systems, and automates parts of the development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make it easier to work with Git. The repo command is an executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path.
  
The name of is somewhat unfortunate as it makes it difficut to find information about it.
 We used it at work to manage the whole build that is made op interconnected builds that are developed and worked on by multile persons and teams. 
 I wonder if someone here has any experience of using magit together with this?

 When I accept an invitation the event on an email client (even a non-MS one), the event is automatically added to my calendar and I think an email is sent to the event organizer.
 Is it possible to replicate this in notmuch? Is it a simple case of replying with "Accepted" in the title?
