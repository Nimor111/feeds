        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 I tried emacs out in the late 90s, and gave up because I couldn't remap `C-x` to `'next-line` (I still use WordStar keybindings, mock away). I thought I'd try again. It's been 25 years. Surely you can re-map `C-x` by now? It even has evil-mode, so it might work.
 It doesn't work. At least I can't get it to work.
 It works fine if I open a file and do normal stuff. As soon as I try to use `counsel-describe-function` or really almost anything in the mini-buffer at all... blamo. `C-x` is mapped to something else, and I get `Key Sequence C-x X starts with non-prefix key C-x` 
 So, is there a way to fix this? Or should I just try again in 25 years?

But I was debugging a problem with my init file which hadn't loaded completely, had the problem halfway solved but then accidentally suspended the Emacs GUI. Now I have to restart Emacs and redo that work for no good reason.
 Being able to suspend Emacs from a terminal makes sense, but why does this feature exist at all when running it in a GUI? If anything, it seems like some kind of practical joke.
 There doesn't seem to be any way to recover the previous state of the program. I already tried all the suggestions on this page.
 I'm sure I can't be the first to complain about this. Would a bug report be a waste of time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering about the trajectory of my zettelkasting. Am I just wandering around? Do I have a coherent path? I've been thinking about my ZK, whether it supports my goals, and if I'm feeding it appropriately. Maybe this is something I shouldn't worry about. Does this resonate with you?
What are my feelings about my zettelkasting?
Please open up and share with the community what you've been working on and your plans for your zettelkasting this week.
This past week found me doing:
A deep dive into structured python programming. I'm using my 'Rakusu Ring spreadsheet' as a foil for this project.
I received the course syllabus for 'ENGL 463 Geographies of Nonfiction', which has a hybrid writing and literature structure. I've started pouring the foundation in my ZK for this 20-week project: nine books, a dozen short stories, and a half dozen writing assignments. I started reading a couple of weeks ago, but now I must pour gas on the fire and read a lot.
Refactored my Keyboard Maestro note templates. I simplified them and made them more broadly applicable.
My current plans for this coming week:
Class starts on the 23rd, and I have seven more books to read in preparation. Lots of reading ahead with little time for zettelkasting.


When I'm procrastinating class work/reading, I'll be reading:



Here are a few of the titles and one-sentence summaries of zettel I created last week.
I'm excited about "Literate Programming," Donald Knuth's thesis on this programming paradigm has arrived at the library on interlibrary loan. I'll pick it up on Tuesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like Steve Purcell's SanityInc Tomorrow themes, but would like something between night and bright.
 I copied emacs/.local/elpa/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-20220412.1643/sanityinc-tomorrow-night-theme.el and ./emacs/.local/elpa/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-20220412.1643/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow.el to ~/.config/doom/themes and added my- to each. I then added a color definition I called dusk to my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow.el:
  69c69,82 < '((night . ((background . "#1d1f21") --- > '((dusk . ((background . "#1d1f21") > (alt-background . "#151515151515") > (current-line . "#2a2a2a") > (selection . "#424242") > (foreground . "#eaeaea") > (comment . "#969896") > (red . "#d54e53") > (orange . "#e78c45") > (yellow . "#e7c547") > (green . "#b9ca4a") > (aqua . "#70c0b1") > (blue . "#7aa6da") > (purple .

"#1d1f21") 1651c1664 < (defun color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow (mode) --- > (defun my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow (mode) 1676a1690,1695 > (defun color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-dusk () > "Apply the tomorrow dusk theme." > (interactive) > (my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow 'dusk)) > 
 And created this my-sanityinc-tomorrow-dusk-theme.el:  (add-load-path! "/Users/aqjo/.config/doom/themes") (require 'my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow) (color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-dusk) 
 Despite my having defined it as shown above, the latest error I'm getting is Symbol's function definition is void: color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-dusk.
 I feel like I might be making this more difficult than it needs to be. Is there a simple way to define a theme with the colors I want without all the intricacies that are in this set of themes?
 In fact, I might use afternoon or dark+ if I could make the alt-background (I think it is) more prominent.
 Thanks

 foldr: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b

 Why on earth are these function signatures different? 😭 
 You could simply keep the signatures exactly the same for both, without affecting the function body, nor the output. But having different signatures means if you swap from using a foldr to a foldl, you have to swap your own function that it calls too. 
 I don't see the point.

 So how do I actually implement these types?

 I have encountered so many hooks in Emacs for different types buffers. Like ielm-mode-hook, term-mode-hook, text-mode-hook, prog-mode-hook. Sure there must be many more.
 While disabling or enabling some features using these hooks I am never sure if I have enabled or disabled it on all the hooks.
 Like I want to add line numbers to any "text non-I/O" buffers. By this mean only buffers where I write text or code but do not run REPL or any interactive tools. Are text-mode-hook and prog-mode-hook enough? Am I missing some other hooks?
 What if I want to add some function to "interactive I/O" buffers like REPLs, terminals, or other interactive tools? Like if I have line numbers enabled by default but I want to disable them in interactive buffers like this, is it enough to hook that function to term-mode-hook and ielm-mode-hook? Am I missing any other hooks?
 Is there a full list of hooks somewhere? At least the built-in ones? Is there some categorizing of those hooks like these ones are just for writing text and these ones are for interactive buffers?

 I have corfu and cape and none of them contain any of those keywords:
  (use-package corfu :init (global-corfu-mode) :custom (corfu-auto t) (corfu-cycle t) (corfu-auto-prefix 1) (corfu-auto-delay 0.1) (corfu-quit-no-match 'separator) (corfu-excluded-modes '(org-mode mu4e-compose-mode))) (use-package cape :init (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-dabbrev) (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-file)) 
 I don't think corfu is something I need right when Emacs starts up so I think it is safe to defer both corfu and cape manually with :defer t right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My note: Selection functions are interesting notion with tricky implementation
 The notion of selection functions is simple: scala type J[R, A] = (A => R) => A  We have the evaluation function A => R that tells how to judge an object. And we receive back "the best" object (possible options are embodied).
 The topic is being actively researched. And papers are not simple sometimes to start from scratch. I tried to make an introduction that will help to do the first steps.
 For instance, it was not so easy to understand (and implement, for sure) product to combine selections: ```scala def product[R, A]: List[J[R, A]] => J[R, List[A]] =
 (functions: List[J[R, A]]) =>
 (listEval: List[A] => R) =>
 functions match {
 case evalFun :: restEvalFunctions =>
 val a: A =
 evalFun((candidate: A) =>
 listEval(
 candidate ::
 product
 .apply(restEvalFunctions)
 .apply(
 restCandidates =>
 listEval(candidate :: restCandidates)
 )
 )
 ) 
  val as: List[A] = product(restEvalFunctions)(rest => listEval(a :: rest)) a :: as case Nil => Nil } 
 ```
 And the product is really useful. Playing games (like chess) or graph searches ofter really represent picking some "best" state.
 I hope somebody will find it useful.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to add a bunch of php files that are in a directory into an org document as separate code blocks. This is what I want to achieve:
 #+begin_src html :tangle "/sudo::/srv/http/01.php" <?php // code of 01.php ?> #+end_src #+begin_src html :tangle "sudo::/srv/http/02.php" <?php // code of 02.php ?> #+end_src 
 The idea is to have an org document with the php code imbedded. Then it is easy to create the website from one org document by running org-babel-tangle. Right now I'm using a bash code block to create results:
 #+name: php-files #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output cd $HOME/Downloads/; for f in *; do echo "#+begin_src html :tangle '/sudo::/srv/http/$f'" paste /dev/null - < "$f" #pukes out php content of file echo "#+end_src" echo "" done #+end_src #+RESULTS: php-files #+begin_example ,#+begin_src html :tangle '/sudo::/srv/http/01.php' <?php // code of 01.php ?> ,#+end_src ,#+begin_src html :tangle '/sudo::/srv/http/02.php' <?php // code of 01.php } ?> #+end_example 
 This output is almost what I want. Except the comma prefixes (default behavior of code blocks ) and single quote instead of double quote. (the double quotes can be generated by the bash script. I will figure this out later).
 At the moment I am using a keyboard macro to remove the , and overwrite ' with ". This can also be done by evil mode. My question is if there are other ways to create these code block outputs? Preferably the code should be part of the org document, to make the document portable.

 Note that W c does a great job creating multiple patches from a selected range of revisions. It is this "single commit" patch workflow that I can't figure out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I have a stream of data which is mostly sensor readings, and would like to make a Haskell program to visualize those readings in real time. Some I would display in pretty much their raw value as text, some maybe in a bar graph, gauges probably... I'm not sure what exactly yet, and am happy to adjust to the library if worthwhile.
 Think of it as similar to a dashboard. No human input (mouse, keyboard...) present.
 The graphics library does not have to be super tailored for exactly that use case, if I have to come up with the "widgets" myself that's okay. But then it should have a reasonable set of drawing primitives, e.g. for boxes and rendering text.
 Direct output to framebuffer preferred, but if it only works under X it's not a dealbreaker. The output display is fixed resolution and the graphics would always be displayed full screen, so no real need for resizing or dynamic scale, distances and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I want to ask for some guidance/opinions.
 I’m currently a “Data Scientist” with a decade of experience in statistics, analytics, machine learning, etc. But lately I’ve been exploring the possibility of switching paths towards a more engineering kind of thing. At least for a while, I’d like something where I get to focus more on writing good, tested, maintainable, reusable code (things that are valued but not prioritized in DS). I feel that focusing on those things would make me a better professional even if I decide to come back to a DS/ML job later.
 And it would be great to be able to use more Scala and FP (something that I get to do only rarely in my area, since Python is lingua franca).
 I guess that Data Engineer would be the most feasible role to switch into, since there is some intersection/synergy with the job experience I already have… although maybe not that much...
 So my question is, based on your experience actually working as engineers… do you think this is feasible? Are there some areas that I should focus on strengthening before being able to attempt this? Would I have to start at a junior role, or is my experience in DS/ML pertinent enough for me to aspire to a higher seniority?
 I know that this is pretty unorthodox, but hell, if it makes me enjoy my day to day work even more, then I think it’s worth considering. I just want to know how realistic this all is :P

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I want to create org headings that have these two properties attached:
 * Heading :PROPERTIES: :Created: [2022-08-13 Sat 23:41] :Modified: [2022-08-13 Sat 23:52] :END: Content of heading .. .. 
 Having these allow me to sort notes and stuff by recent modification date if I ever need.
 I just don't know how to automate the updating of the :modified: field. Let's say my cursor is inside the heading. I need something that searches backwards and updates the first occurence of :modified: and updates it with current date and time.
 I was wondering if anyone knows a package that offers such functionality?

 I'm curious: I know that there exist many exporting features to sync org-mode agendas as calendar files (.ics etc...) to view your agenda in a calendar GUI. However, what I'm curious about (and wish to find) is a package which displays your org-mode agenda in an org table calendar? So that you don't have to export anything. It would all be displayed in an emacs buffer with a table layout and links to agenda events? Does this exist?
 I figured since I'm doing almost everything in emacs now for organization, why not include a calendar view as well?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Software monoliths are sort of an older way of building software, and making things small and single purpose has been Linux wisdom the Unix Philosophy that is usually right. Emacs is the biggest threat to hypocrisy here, since it can itself be considered a huge monolith that does everything. Aside from that, however, there are other remarkable monoliths (giant pieces of software with huge code-bases and broad functionality) in the emacs ecosystem, some of which are so big and established and useful that they are hard to replace. What are some of your favorites, and what do they do that is hard to replace for you?
 Here are some of mine:
  
Org-mode. It's breadth is actually part of its value-proposition with literate programming in many languages, publication to a plethora of outputs, and rich note-taking (code notebook-style) to an extent unreached by any other tool of which I'm aware. Plus it's really good for actually taking tech/class notes.
 Gnus. Letting me easily* do email across many addresses in emacs, and integrating well with the related monolith...
 BBDB. It has great support for all manner of contacts and, apparently, all sorts of exports, with prevalent and rich interfaces.
 Helm. Really a swiss-army knife of completion, but there have been a plethora of lighter more specific altervatives in the past few years. Nonetheless, my students loved the ease and "do it all" made possible by Helm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scala is a great programming language for data related tasks. A good, Arrow-backed, dependency free DataFrame library would be a great way to make Scala even better for data programming. Spark is great for big data, but Scala would benefit from having a DataFrame library for small data tasks as well.
 I'll quote one of the commentors in a recent thread I created: "The real problem is that we have no simple alternative for Pandas and numpy"
 I'd be happy to collaborate with someone on this effort if you're interested. I am a dev advocate and am already working with the creators of Polars and DataFusion, two Rust based DataFrame libraries, to help them grow their projects. Interested if the community thinks this is a good idea. I don't have the coding skills to build an Arrow-based Scala DataFrame lib myself, but would be happy to help out with the project evangelism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am curious what your strategies/approaches are for using a literate org config.
 Currently I have the following in my init.el:
 elisp (require 'org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "/path/to/config.org")) 
 My whole configuration resides in a single, separate org file, including the early-init part (which is tangled to a separate early-init.el file in user-emacs-directory).
 Whilst this mostly works fine, this approach gives me issues when I try to use the latest version of org-mode via straight.el. I believe this is caused by the fact that I'm loading the built-in org version in init.el, and then trying to load/use an updated version in config.org (which causes some void variable errors for me).
 Alternative strategies are to put something like (load-file "config.el") in init.el, and tangle config.org manually or on save.
 Just curious how you all are using your literate org config file, and whether there is anyone who was able to solve/avoid the issue with org that I'm having (I could stick to the built-in version, but I would like to be able to use the latest version).

 However, the only thing I miss from (Neo)vim as an ex-vimmer is C-o and C-i to jump back and forth.
 I found this better-jumper package and tried to use it: emacs-lisp (use-package better-jumper :ensure t :init (better-jumper-mode 1) :config (define-key input-decode-map "\\C-i" \[C-i\]) :bind (("C-o" . 'better-jumper-jump-backward) ("C-i" . 'better-jumper-jump-forward)))  But it doesn't seem to automatically record positions. For instance, I want to move back to where I was after I C-M-. via C-o.
 Is there a way to automatically do this without full-fledged Doom emacs or evil-mode?
 I'm fine with cherry-picking only this feature from evil-mode, btw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 Yes, this is another post about someone switching editors. I know, there are a lot, but I think those are important because that kind of posts drove my decisions in the past.
 I move constantly between editors (Vim => Emacs => Neovim => Emacs => Neovim => Vscode (1 day) => Neovim => ...). The only thing that is nonnegotiable is modal editing.
 Last time I switched from Emacs because of the **huge** amount of time it takes to open (no, I do not like emacsclient). IIRC, it was taking 8s to start in my machine. Hence, I migrate to Neovim and Lua.
 Neovim is a fantastic project! Lua will bring it to a new level! However, I started to miss a GUI and some polished tools I had in Emacs. All GUIs in Neovim are almost a terminal in a graphical application. It really does not add something new. Furthermore, since Lua integration is relatively new, I often find some rough edges. 99% can be fixed relatively easily. However, I just do not have time anymore to tweak my configuration as I had back in the day.
 So, I heard about gccemacs and tried again. WOW! That's a game changer!
 After 20 min compiling everything shipped with Doom emacs by default (yes, this is the bad side of the tradeoff), Emacs starts in less than 2s. It is even faster than my Neovim with all plugins. So, if anyone quit Emacs because of performance, give it one more try. Just do not mind the initial compilation time...
 Finally, I just want to thanks the amazing job of u/hlissner, Doom Emacs is amazing and you can use it out-of-the-box. Exactly what I need now.

 (defun fzf-or-find-file () (interactive) (if (equal current-prefix-arg nil) (find-file) (fzf-find-file))) 
 This works with C-u M-x fzf-or-find-file (the fzf version runs), but when I DON'T pass a Ctrl-u, find-file ... fails. I'm sure I'm calling it incorrectly here, but pointers welcome.
 The failure looks like this

If i remember correctly, some common lisp implementations already compile lisp to machine code (like sbcl). Since elisp and common lisp are both in the same family, i was wondering how difficult would it be to compile the elisp libraries in emacs into common lisp, load them into an sbcl image, and obtain emacs with native compilation built in. 
 This could be further interfaced with other common lisp projects like Nyxt to provide further functionality. Would something like this be feasible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone's different. I would like to get a take from the community on my situation here.
 I'm approaching middle age and have always tried to use ergonomic tools & techniques and yet I am developing RSI. My right hand is particularly bad. I have an appointment with my doctor to have a chat about it, but I am pretty sure that contorting my thumbs/hands in general to hit the meta/ctrl/shift keys have not helped me.
 I have enjoyed some modal editing in my journey. My current favorite packages for that are Meow & god-mode. I honestly have not decided which I like better but both "de-chord" my commands. Meow does this with a "keypad" mode that is for all intents and purposes a leader key. This adds 1 additional key press in exchange for no modifiers. Meow has better text navigation, overall god-mode reduces key-presses much more dramatically.
 I am also considering learning/training myself to use both hands at all times and avoid pressing 2 keys with one hand at any given time. This only gets dicey with 3 key chords (like C-M-/M-S-/C-S/-).
 I'm trying to get a sense of which is the best course of action here. Heck, maybe I should do both?
 EDIT: You all have been amazing. Thank you so much for the advice! If I did not manage to respond to you please know that I am grateful

With this in mind, I've been updating my linking practices.
Are you approaching linking casually as an afterthought?
I already have a summary (subatomic) and I could optionally add a "Link Solidifier" in () directly after the link.

  
Example

These are similar, but the subatomic summary is statically created when the zettel was created, and the "Link Solidifier" is more dynamic when the connection is created.



I have lots of thoughts about the value and practice of linking ideas. I want to start the discussion somewhere. What are your ideas? How do you work with the different types of links? It's funny that we have hundreds of note types but a slim taxonomy of links.
Experiment! Let me know what you think.

 I think my key packages are pdf-tools, org mode, org-roam, org-transclusion, org-remark, and org-roam-bibtex with citar. I use straight.el + use-package to manage my packages.
 I do a lot of my reading Zotero and then export stuff to Emacs, but I'd be interested in moving more to Emacs too. 
 Currently using selectrum, but I hear that's being phased out in favour of vertico. I've liked prescient and I believe there's a hack to use it with vertico. I have consult installed too, although I haven't used marginalia or corfu yet. Interested in using them though!
 Any other cool packages that might work for my use case of finding documents, writing documents, and displaying connections between them?
 Or just quality of life improvement stuff? E.g. Zotero or Firefox integration, better buffer management, better scrolling, UI stuff.
 I've heard a lot of great things about evil, so interested in adding that to my init, but I've never used vim by itself. Any cool guides to getting started with evil that don't assume vim knowledge? 
 And what additional elements of the evil ecosystem should I add? I can't tell the difference between org-evil and evil-org.

 I'm working on a project at the moment looking at setting up SAST/DAST security scanning where I work, and one language I need to support is Scala. Now, I'm a security engineer, not a software dev, and I don't know a jot about Scala. I've heard some noise around Scala being a secure-by-default language thanks to it's type safety, which I don't totally buy (that is, I see how that could make it secure in terms of input validation, but security doesn't just come down to input validation!) 
 Anyways that said, I have a couple of questions:
  
Can you point to me to any resources around secure software development for Scala specifically?
 Have any of you got any experience in using SAST tools like Semgrep, Snyk Code, Codacy, Checkmarx, etc? If so, can you tell me about that? Likes, dislikes, was it useful, etc?
  
​
 What I absolutely want to avoid is ending up rolling something out that ultimately wastes dev time and pisses people off :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I would like to ask whether it is possible to speed up the first GTK3 frame creation (not `init.el` loading)
 Background: Emacs 28.1 with GTK3 on ArchLinux (Awesome WM) and Ubuntu 20.04 (Gnome 3.36), both with Xorg. The config is on GitHub. On both machines the startup time for a non daemon Emacs UI instance is roughly the same and fluctuates between 0.46-0.55 seconds (depending on machine load perhaps, not sure), measured by `emacs-init-time`. The same measurement when opening a frame created from daemon (by `systemd`, but it shouldn't matter) or in terminal is 0.104 sec. When using `emacs -Q` it is 0.319 sec.
 So, although the startup times are fine, I anyway would like to find a way to lessen the time it takes to draw a GTK3 frame which is roughly 0.3 sec. as far as I understand (this is by simply calculating the difference between non-daemon UI init time and a daemon one). 
 Why? Because I want it faster and because the frame flickers when it is drawn :)
 So, basically this is not about the speed of `init` loading, but UI drawing (although I will gladly accept suggestions to speed up the init as well [the config is in the works, I choose not to use `use-package`, but instead to employ manual tweaks]).
 Is it even possible to lessen this time? By the measurement of `-Q` it seems not...
 Thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've started putting together a typeclass for differences in my current project. The simple example would be UTCTime and NominalDiffTime from Data.Time. The general structure that I have at the moment is
 -- | A type where we can reify changes class Diffable base where -- | The type of the changes type Metric base -- | Find the change between two values diff :: base -> base -> Metric base -- | Update a value with a set of changes move :: base -> Metric base -> base instance Diffable UTCTime where type Metric UTCTime = NominalDiffTime diff = diffUTCTime move = flip addUTCTime 
 with a couple of laws
 move old (diff new old) = new diff (move old path) old = path 
 with the additional conditions for when Metric base is a Monoid.
 (diff a b) <> diff(b c) = diff a c diff a a = mempty 
 I've searched for something like this in the past, but never found it. However, I'm not a clever person, so I fully expect that I might have missed something. Alternately, perhaps there's a fundamental flaw with this abstraction that will come back to bite me? As it stands, my current project requires reifying the changes in a deeply nested structure and being able to create Diffable instances for the container classes has vastly simplified my code.

 I don't know what to choose. After reading around I can define this minimals.
  
Spellchecking of by default.
 shortcut for toggeling on/off
 Switching between languages English and German
 Choose between suggested corrections
 Save "new" words
  
As and addon it would be nice but doesn't have to: - Use German and English in the same buffer at the same time - Spell check docstrings in Python code
 Sidenote: I am not sure if this is relevant but in Python I use eglot as LSP which checks my code (via flycheck8 or flymake8 or something with fly...).
 Sidenote2: In some web source I saw that ivy and custom also are relevant here. I use both of them in my init.el.
 Sidenote3: 95% of time I use Emacs in terminal via SSH and not in gui mode.

 When I do this and export it to html it works (even though I have only Aaa as subheader, despite the "headlines 2" in the TOC options at the end, I don't know why) 
 #+OPTIONS: toc:nil #+title: Minimal example * A ** Aa :PROPERTIES: :CUSTOM_ID: test :END: *** Aaa **** Aaaa **** Aaab * B #+TOC: headlines 2 :target #test

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According tothe docs, the c source files generate an executable called temacs which is just the lisp interpreter plus IO routines. This then loads the lisp libraries which provide the full emacs experience. The manual then says that temacs dumps some files according to the shell arguments it received.
 If it received pdump, it dumps an exact copy of itself plus the recorded routines from the lisp libraries it loaded (into a file called emacs.pdump).
 If it received dump, it dumps an executable lisp image of itself with all the lisp libraries already loaded.
 It would make sense to me that the 2nd option is the one used to distribute emacs via package managers, but according to the docs, this option is deprecated. 
 Does this mean that when i apt install emacs, I am installing the exact copy of temacs + an emacs.pdump file?
 Also, if using "pdump" the dumped executable is an exact copy of temacs, could I stop the build process right after the C source has compiled and use temacs as a bare bones emacs (maybe load the lisp libraries myself)?
 Im not planning to do this, im just curious about the mechanics of the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to use Org-mode HTML export with Liquid tags which has been set up by my team. The final exported html should be something like this:
 {% extends 'base.html' %} {% load static %} {% block content %} <div class="blah"> ...blah ... </div> {% endblock %} 
 Now, I can easily use #+begin_export html in the beginning of my file to include the header tags. However, I'm unable to include the bottom liquid tag in the correct hierarchy, as Org export automatically adds a closing </div> after the included liquid tag. A minimal example:
 #+title: My website #+OPTIONS: toc:nil html-style:nil num:nil html-scripts:nil html-preamble:nil html-postamble:nil #+begin_export html {% extends 'base.html' %} {% load static %} {% block content %} #+end_export * Welcome to my website Welcome to my small website. * Contact us Some info on how to contact us. #+begin_export html {% endblock %} #+end_export 
 I know Org treats hierarchies strictly, so that is why perhaps the last html_export is added to the Contact Us section. Any ideas how to avoid that and keep this tag as the last output in the html? Thanks in advance!
 Edit : Solved, check comments!

In parallel, this post aims to illustrate a use case of Chainsail with an example of probabilistic clustering with soft k-means.
You will see that the Bayesian model discussed here exhibits a multimodal posterior distribution, and whereas single-chain MCMC algorithms notoriously struggle to correctly sample similar posteriors, we will show how Chainsail improves on that state of affairs.

Soft k-means clustering
Soft k-means clustering, also known as fuzzy clustering, is the probabilistic version of the better known k-means clustering.

 I was really excited to create a Jupyter notebook that showcases some Delta Lake functionality the other day.
 I had a nice workflow installing different Java versions using SDKMAN but switched to Coursier because that't what's recommended in the Almond installation guide. In order to run `jupter lab` and start up the notebook environment, I need to separately install Jupyter Lab via conda (and activate that conda environment).
 I'm a little stuck now because apparently Coursier doesn't let me download a version of Java that's optimized for the M1, see this issue.
 Let me know if you have any suggestions on the best way for me to setup my machine. It's awesome how much progress has been made on tooling in Scala.

 It's a simple package that modifies messages so that additional text is appended and right-aligned. I use it to show information that I want to see regardless of the current buffer (in my case, time a notmuch email indicator and today's task statistics).

 https://preview.redd.it/3u3ui7xfxvg91.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=0695895836722596efd543173adba170196b1de5
 You can use it as follows to show the time for example.
 (require 'echo-line) ;; Enable `display-time-mode` to update the `display-time-string` (display-time-mode 1) ;; Optionally delete the time string from the mode-line (delete 'display-time-string global-mode-string) ;; Update the echo-line every time the display-time is updated (add-hook 'display-time-hook 'echo-line-update) ;; Set the echo-line format (setq echo-line-format '((:eval display-time-string))) ;; Show the echo-line immediately (echo-line-mode) 
 The main changes from the original code is creating a global minor-mode, a slightly different way to right align text and other small checks to make sure that the messages are always displayed correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I've been a Haskell consultant for the past 3 years. Before that I have 4 years of .NET (with a bit of F# as well), so I'm pretty comfortable with both FP and OOP concepts.
 I absolutely love FP and Haskell, but there's so little work that it's frustrating. I have been "stuck" on the same project for 3 years now, which is getting pretty boring.
 Lately I've started considering switching to something more popular like Scala, as there's a much larger variety of projects and clients, but a call with a recruiter today confused me.
 I'm based in Europe and have a permanent contract at 450EUR day rate. The recruiter told me that transitioning to Scala would require a massive pay cut as no one would hire someone without production experience at that rate. He also said that usually Scala people's attitude towards Haskell developers is hostile.
 Does that statement have any merit? It sounds to me that he's just lacking technical understanding, but I don't know.
 What is your impression about that? How would you go about transitioning?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I absolutely hate when my projects leave traces of the tools I use. My projects should contain the source code of the program, and anything required for it to function, or directly related with it, nothing else.
 Emacs doesn't seem to think the same. It litters the directory you're editing with backup and lock files, and I don't understand why.
 While I seem to have been successful in stopping backup files from popping up, I can't do the same with lock files. Despite setting the variable create-lockfiles to nil, it still creates them.
 Ideally, I'd want these lock files to exist, just somewhere else. They shouldn't be where I'm editing. I don't really know how to control, this. There was a variable to change that but I always failed at setting it, complaining I was using the wrong type.
 Anyway, this code is what I have at the very top of my init file, this is all I need to keep my working directory (and my config folder) clean from Emacs' shenanigans.
 (setq user-emacs-directory (expand-file-name "~/.local/share/emacs")) (setq user-config-directory (expand-file-name "~/.config/emacs")) (setq native-comp-eln-load-path '((. "~/.local/share/emacs/eln-cache"))) (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory)) (setq package-user-dir (expand-file-name "elpa" user-emacs-directory)) (setq url-history-file (expand-file-name "url/history" user-emacs-directory)) (setq delete-old-versions t) (setq create-lockfiles nil) (setq auto-save-list-file-prefix (expand-file-name "auto-save-list/.saves-" user-emacs-directory)) (setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.local/share/emacs/backups"))) 
 Does anybody know why Emacs STILL creates lock files where I'm editing? It's very annoying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using multi-term to manage multiple terminals. When I open a new term with M-x multi-term RET, the terminal is in char mode which is good.
 I execute a command in the terminal like this:
 echo hello world 
 Then I type C-p but nothing happens. I check C-h v term-bind-key-alist RET and it has this info:
 term-bind-key-alist is a variable defined in ‘multi-term.el’. Its value is shown below. The key alist that will need to be bind. If you do not like default setup, modify it, with (KEY . COMMAND) format. You can customize this variable. Value: (("C-c C-c" . term-interrupt-subjob) ("C-c C-e" . term-send-esc) ("C-p" . previous-line) ("C-n" . next-line) ("C-s" . isearch-forward) ("C-r" . isearch-backward) ("C-m" . term-send-return) ("C-y" . term-paste) ("M-f" . term-send-forward-word) ("M-b" . term-send-backward-word) ("M-o" . term-send-backspace) ("M-p" . term-send-up) ("M-n" . term-send-down) ("M-M" . term-send-forward-kill-word) ("M-N" . term-send-backward-kill-word) ("<C-backspace>" . term-send-backward-kill-word) ("M-r" . term-send-reverse-search-history) ("M-d" . term-send-delete-word) ("M-," . term-send-raw) ("M-." . comint-dynamic-complete)) 
 So by default C-p is bound to previous-line. So when I type C-p in terminal (which is in char mode), the cursor should move one line up? But nothing happens when I type C-p in the terminal.
 What good is the entry for ("C-p" . previous-line) in term-bind-key-alist then if C-p does nothing? Anyone savvy can help me to understand what the use of this entry is?

 Feel free to create GitHub issues if you have ideas, or comment it here. You can also find a pre-packaged version of it for GNU/Linux systems and for macOS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just an FYI that we've tagged v1.0, which is us concluding that Citar is basically feature-complete, and we're comfortable with the API and keeping it more stable (sorry for the recent breaking changes!).
 Along with some major recent internal (in particular cache) and API changes, we've separated the embark-related code into a new package and minor-mode: citar-embark. I highly recommend it.
 Note: we do have a known performance issue apparent with large files that change frequently. The fix for this will mostly happen in parsebib.
 Also, I've updated the Doom biblio module to incorporate these changes, and updated all of its packages. This remains the easiest path to have a working citar-oriented system; just turn on the biblio and vertico modules, and set some paths.
 The note API in 1.0 in turn enables a small integration extension: citar-org-roam. This is partly a demo and test of the new API, but should also be useful for users, and developers that might want to build on it. This still needs a bit of work before I submit it to MELPA; PRs welcome.
 Any questions?

 (use-package org :ensure nil :hook (org-mode . (lambda () (org-indent-mode) (variable-pitch-mode -1) (display-line-numbers-mode -1) (set-input-method "custom-input-method"))) .. .. 
 The set-input-method loads some custom keys I defined to insert phonetic symbols:
 (quail-define-rules ;; Phonetic symbols ("\\uh" ?ə) ; UNSTRESSED SCHWA VOWEL ("\\uH" ?ʌ) ; STRESSED SCHWA VOWEL ("\\ii" ?ɪ) ; NEAR-CLOSE NEAR-FRONT UNROUNDED VOWEL ("\\uu" ?ʊ) ; NEAR-CLOSE NEAR-BACK ROUNDED VOWEL .. .. 
 I use these symbols quite often in my documents so I would like the input method to be enabled by default in Org mode which it works using the code above.
 I have two questions:
 When (set-input-method "custom-input-method") enables the custom input method does that have any negative side effect on the default input method? or the custom input method will just add the additional characters on top of the default input method?
 Is there a command to disable the custom input method while in Org mode? I don't think I will need to disable it but I'm just wondering.

 I learned haskell on/off for two or three years now. It looks very interesting, and I tried few pet projects, but I always get discouraged by ecosystem and, in fact, lack of any real project to actually invest any larger time in (this project should finally change that). And I fear debugging Haskell code (how do you do that without stepping though code?), albeit I never needed it, so maybe that fear is unfunded.

 Now I edit a file hello.txt (so it's fundamental-mode). I type C-j C-f hoping it will behave like C-x C-f and trigger find-file minibuffer. But when I type C-j C-f, the cursor moves by one place forward. The mapping of C-j to C-x has no effect.
 I check C-h k C-j and this help is shown:
 C-j runs the command "" (found in global-map), which is a keyboard

 It is bound to C-j. Macro: C-x Keyboard macro. 
 Obviously I am doing something wrong. Can I somehow remap C-j to behave exactly like C-x?

What is a good way to do this? The logs can be fairly large ~35MB and I need to search through all of it for debug purposes. 
 I have tried logview-mode and log4j-mode, but it seems they can't deal with the log output of docker. Or maybe I haven't configured correctly?

 I'm not new to programming, and I think I have a decent grasp of the fundamentals of Haskell (I've tried learning the language several times), but I found the examples here lacking and some of the homework a little absurd. I could do most of the exercises, but not all of them, and I could do almost nothing with the final project on graphics.
 Are the exercises just difficult? Is it a poorly regarded resource, or am I just slow to learn?

 just to start with, i see myself as rookie on the emacs platform - started to use emacs because org-mode, then terminale, then buffers for build/edit configs for network equipment.
 now the time is for mu4e and im already loving the way i can easily control my mailbox and add them to my org-aganda.. i only see myself using emacs more and more in the future.
 my question is: when i forward a email containing picture or other files - my mu is stripping my mail for these file - what im a missing, is that normal behavior or have i configured my mu4e wrong?
 if needed i can post the config.

For years I saw these interesting plugins to help code completion completely pass me by because converting the project I was on into a format understandable by clang was a huge hassle.
 Well, now I'm working on an Unreal project, and its build steps let me create a compile_commands.json file that works with clangd. 
 But the compile_commands.json file is about 745MB, and I was getting constant blocking stalls in emacs. If I opened up the eglot events buffer, it was scrolling endlessly, presumably because of background generation of semantic data that would be used for all the interesting stuff that you want to use clangd for.
 Hunting around, I found mention of clangd-indexer, which creates a static index.

 I would like to collect/export the results of the search (acting as a snapshot of my search state), and I would also like the embark export buffer to update. E.g. if I select a search result and change it so it no longer matches the search, it should no longer show in the buffer.
 ​
 Each time I've tried to use embark-act -> embark-live; the focus stays in the vertico search. I've fumbled and tried a few things to dismiss the search and work with the embark-live buffer but can't seem to figure that out.
 ​
 Any tips for what I'm doing wrong? (Does embark support this workflow?)

My ultimate goal is to find a way to batch change the Titles of PDF's, the solution for which, I have not been able to find. So, I thinking about trying to come at it from another angle. I can batch change file names easily enough with an app, so I'm hoping that someone can help with a script that can batch change PDF Titles to match their file name. Anyone have any ideas?

 Because I'm not using a standard QWERTY layout but instead a Dvorak layout, I have to rebind most of the normal binds. I'm doing this with evil-mode and a custom minor mode, through which I declare all navigation keys. This evil-dvorak-mode is turned on globally. The basic motion keys for me look like this:
 (evil-define-key 'visual evil-dvorak-mode-map "h" 'evil-next-line "t" 'evil-previous-line "d" 'evil-backward-char "n" 'evil-forward-char )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I've written a new package to track down the correct Python executables from the various virtualenvs that you might create for your Python projects.
 In short, the motivation for this package is that modern Python projects typically rely on a bunch of linters and formatters, and they can all be installed in different virtualenvs. This package will find those installed in pre-commit, then poetry, and then finally whatever is on your exec-path, and then assign the absolute paths to many of the supported Emacs package variables.
 This package is in early preview, but it's perfectly usable for most situations by my estimate. If you run into any problems, please don't hesitate to file an issue on the repo.
 Also, if you have any idea writing tests for this package without having me creating all kinds of a fixtures or mocking dozens of things, please let me know!

 As I understand, compiler can't do it generally, because there can be other instances of MonadState' s for ExceptT s m. But in this case I definitely know, they should not exist. Is there any way to tell compiler "for this class this is a single instance and you can add MonadState' s (ExceptT s m) => MonadState' s m to your inferred rules list"? As far as I see, there shouldn't be any problems with that for typechecking, so I hope this has already been realized. Or there are some problems that I can't forsee?
 Motivation: I try to make it possible to change, for example, type of error of transformer without decomposing whole monad. So, roughly speaking, I would like to have the function haskell mapError :: (MonadError e m, MonadError e' m', ???) => (e -> e') -> m -> m'  this can be done using type families (like MappedErrorMonad e e' m m') for errors only. But we have a problem when there is some state both at the left and right sides. So we want to tell compiler something like MappedErrorMonad e e' m m' => (MonadState s m => MonadState s m'). For this purpose I've introduced haskell class (forall m a. (Monad m, c' (t a m)) => c' (t b m)) => MappableSave (t :: * -> (* -> *) -> * -> *) (c' :: (* -> *) -> Constraint)  And now want to inhabit this class by ExceptT:  instance MappableSave ExceptT (MonadState s)  But compiler failed with error  • Could not deduce (S.MonadState s m) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: (Monad m, S.MonadState s (ExceptT a m)) bound by a quantified context  that's where my topic started

 Does someone know why? I know I could set the bindings manually but that's not very clean and I'd prefer to use this built-in variable if possible.

 -- | A Mal program is a stateful computation with access to an Env. newtype MalProgram a = MalProgram { runMal :: StateT (Env MalFunction) IO a } deriving newtype (Functor, Applicative, Monad, MonadIO, MonadState (Env MalFunction)) -- | Run the provided program. runMalProgram :: String -> IO SomeExpr runMalProgram program = evalStateT (runMal malProgram) newEnv where malProgram = run program setEnvM :: String -> MalFunction -> MalProgram () setEnvM k v = modify (\env -> setEnv env k v) 
 This fails with the following error:
 src/Mal.hs:27:15: error: • Couldn't match expected type: MalProgram () with actual type: StateT (Env MalFunction) m1 () • In the expression: modify (\ env -> setEnv env k v) In an equation for ‘setEnvM’: setEnvM k v = modify (\ env -> setEnv env k v) | 27 | setEnvM k v = modify (\env -> setEnv env k v) 
 Here is the definition of Env along with the setEnv function:
 -- | A wrapper over a Map to hold environment variables. newtype Env a = Env { runEnv :: Map String a } deriving Functor -- | Set a value in the provided environment. setEnv :: Env a -> String -> a -> Env a setEnv m k v = Env $ Map.insert k v (runEnv m)

How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens.
Digital Zettelkasten Principles, Methods, & Examples by David Kadavy.
Introduction to Luhmann’s Zettelkastenthinking and its technical implementation Dr. Daniel Lüdecke.
In the beginning, I thought Zettelkasten is software to use for organizing notes, but it turned out to be a HUGE topic and watched too many videos on Youtube about it and I've set my mind on having a digital Zettelkasten system and syncing it across my computer, mobile, and laptop.
So far I am still looking for which tool to use to build this system because TheArchive software is a MAC version only. By the way, if you may suggest a tool or a scenario to achieve the Zettelkasten system that would be awesome.
I've found some tools like Notion, Obsidian, iAWriter ...etc, and also found some other tools for doing flashcards like Anki which I would like to use as well within the system, and I am still confused between them to pick one and learn it to make the best use of it on the long run.
All opinions and recommendations are highly appreciated.]]></summary>

This past week found me doing:
On Friday, my ZK surpassed 700k words, and by the end of the month, it may surpass 3k zettel. I'm slowly developing a sense of progress.
      20220806 Zettelkasten Statistics
                    ★★★★★
        700803 Total word count
        11801 Total link count
        2905 Total zettel count
                    ★★★★★

I gave up on the "Full Screen" workflow. I couldn't get it working with my Keyboard Maestro macros. I was having no fun.
Discovered a minor bug in my favorite advanced search querying macro.
My current plans for this coming week:
I will work all out on a minor bug in my favorite advanced search querying macro. It likely will require some more Regular Expression pixy-dust.
Reading - The Narrow Road To The Deep North by Matsuo Basho - Travel Journal
Reading - The Book Of Form And Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki - Fiction
Here are a few of the titles of zettel I've been working on last week.
These, along with the migration of 55 #code-snippets, make last week a ZK-focused week. Looking back, it feels like I only spent maybe two open and enjoyably stimulating hours per day working in my ZK. By working, I mean bathing in mind-weather and writing.
Travel Writing and Philosophy


Cognitive Behaviorism


Zettelkasting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who don't know, tree-sitter is "an incremental parsing system". What it basically means is that it provides fancy syntax highlighting by doing a thorough analysis of the code.
 Emacs has treesitter integration via the tree-sitter package. I was using tree-sitter before on neovim and it really great. Well, I'm trying to set it up in emacs and it's pure frustration.
 I've installed the package, and it says that you should also install a language pack. Well, since I was already using treesitter before, then I prefer to not have to compile the language parsers twice, so I decided to unify it in a single directory for both neovim and emacs. Making the change on neovim was a piece of cake. On emacs, I pushed to the tree-sitter-load-path list, and it seems to work... kinda. If I manually call tree-sitter-require 'python for example, it does load the language parser, it even gets listed in tree-sitter-languages. However, it doesn't get enabled, the syntax is the same.
 The variable tree-sitter-language is not getting set. Apparently tree-sitter should map each language major mode to a tree-sitter parser, but it ain't doing it for some reason. Trying to enable treesitter on a python file results in the error "No language registered for "python-mode"".
 Also what about these major modes for each language? I don't want a major mode for each language. I want emacs to open a file, recognize what it is by its extension or otherwise, and that's it. I want highlighting to be handled by treesitter, but it apparently needs to interact with these major modes (of which I need to install more if I want to support other languages) that don't really add anything to me other than bloat. Is there a workaround?

 PMID:39334129 | DOI:10.1207/s12102-021-03242-8
 I wanted to call a function that records the entry into my .bib file and at the same time downloads the PDF of that paper if available using my python function. I cannot seem to do these two actions in a single function so I have to use two functions (one for PMID to get the pdf and other for DOI to get entered into .bib file) which work fine separately:
 (defun extract-PMID-DOI (regexp) (interactive (list (read-regexp "Regexp: "))) (isearch-mode t t) (let ((isearch-regexp nil)) (isearch-yank-string regexp))) (defun fetch-pubmed-pdf () (interactive) (extract-PMID-DOI "PMID:") ;; puts cursor on PMID number (insert (shell-command-to-string (concat "python3 /home/user/fetch_pdfs.py -out /home/user/papers/pdfs/ -pmids " (current-word)))) ) (defun fetch-pubmed-doi () (interactive) (extract-PMID-DOI "DOI:10.") ;; puts cursor on DOI number (doi-utils-add-bibtex-entry-from-doi (concat "10." (current-word)) "~/papers/ref.bib") ) 
 I wanted to know if there is a way for me to combine the two functions fetch-pubmed-pdf and fetch-pubmed-doi into a single function and also if there is a way to link the pdf that was downloaded in my /home/user/papers/pdfs/ to the .bib entry obtained from the doi?

 I have all setup so that a makefile compiles a latex file and creates a pdf. I also setup pdf-tools and synctex. I would like to bind to a key a functions that start to compile, wait for the result, if there is no error from make then it displays in a separate buffer the pdf, else it displays the buffer with the error (which are on stdout because I redirect them and grep the important bits).
 The makefile is important because there are other scripts that modify the latex before actual rendering. It also makes the setup more friendly with only the terminal.
 My experience with lisp is unfortunately very small, any suggestions for resources to read are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I only started using emacs a few days ago, but after getting over hating it for the first day or two, I learned how to do basic things from memory, like install packages, open text files, and use custom themes. I'm a fan now.
 I'd like to set it up to do the sorts or things an IDE would do, but the way I'm doing it doesn't quite have the functionality I'm looking for.
 Currently what I'm doing is opening a buffer with a text file, saving it as "somefile.c" (because I mainly work in C), and using the C major mode by typing "M-x c-mode." That implements syntax highlighting, which is nice, but there's a few things it doesn't do that I'd like it to do:
  
debugging/error correction - At the moment, if I type something like
 include <stdio.h
 
 it doesn't notice my dumb typo, and I'd prefer if it had some kind of feature to tell me what was wrong, rather than just getting a compilation error when I try to compile it. 
  
real time terminal - Ideally, I'd like to open a window with a separate buffer containing a terminal emulator so that I can compile+execute the code within emacs. 
  
Also, if anyone has configured their emacs so that it can be used as an IDE and has found some features helpful, I'd be interested in hearing about them!
 (N.B. I also work in Haskell. I'm having similar issues with the Haskell mode that I'm having with the C mode)

 I would like to keep two org-mode "presets", one for outliners (with indentation, folding, lightweight headings, etc) and one for long form writing (where headings are sections, indentation is undesirable, etc). Startup options act very early in the initialization process and there is no hook to change them AFAICS. Furthermore, I would like to avoid changing the indentation/folding/highlighting state once it has already been wrongly initialized. And I don't want to set all relevant options on a per-file basis. Ideally I would like to programatically match files based on their paths or even some new startup option or keyword, like say "#+outline". So I thought of a before advice that sets the desired options as local variables, but to no avail. For example, here is the advice I use…]]></summary>

 I started using helm and I like it and can already feel its power. But there are two difficulties I am not getting solved.
 1) Is it possible to turn off the display of the full path and just show the base filename in Recentf and Files-from-the-current-directory in my helm-mini-buffer? I know it is done in helm-find-files, but I cannot find a way to turn off the path when using the former two.
 2) Helm-recentf and helm-find-files use icons, which I like, because it helps me find the right file quick and at a glance. Files-from-the-current-directory doesn't show the icons. I would love to have it consistent, as I have both in a helm-mini-buffer, Recentf and Current-directory. Do you know a way to achieve this?
 Thank you so much for any advice!
 Best regards
 Titus

 Every now and then I get a warning that I should use cl is deprecated. How do I get rid of it? I don't think I have require'd it in my own code, but other libraries seem to depend on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When newcomers begin with their first steps in Scala, for example building a simple rest API, they're guided towards the Typelevel ecosystem, http4s or similar. While Scala itself is an advanced language that takes time to learn, adding functional programming on top of that is unbearable for like 99% of newcomers. Doesn't seem like the Scala community embraces the standard Scala anymore, which makes this language for the "elite" only. Back in the day, Akka was sold a silver bullet to all problems and the overhead of complexity wasn't worth it for most. It seems like those pure functional libraries have the same problem, they have an even bigger overhead of complexity. It would be nice to have an ecosystem of standard Scala libraries that don't try to enforce a different style of programming and they will be the standard goto for newcomers. Otherwise, it seems like Scala will continue to decline in popularity since newcomers are not able to absorb the complexity of purely functional programming.

One thing i havent figured out though is how to prioritize specific completions; my search-fu is failing me here. What i want is to be able to provide a list of interactive functions (I only need this for executing extended commands) that, should they be in the list of completions, should be placed first in the completion list. For example, currently if i type in sly connect, the function sly-connect isnt first, that honor goes to sly-list-connections. As there ⠀isnt any way to narrow down completion to just sly-connect without replacing the space with a hyphen, i have to add it to the list of functions i have to type literally. So, is there any way to prioritize certain completions? Or, do you have other recommendations for how to solve this issue without needing to remember specific functions? Thanks!

 project-compile does a good job, but it's interactive, and using it programmatically doesn't seem to be an option.
 Unless there's some weird overrides?
 Either way, I've copied and pasted the command to be non-interactive:
 (defun ct/project-compile (command) "Run `compile' non-interactively in the project root with `command'." (let ((default-directory (project-root (project-current t))) (compilation-buffer-name-function (or project-compilation-buffer-name-function compilation-buffer-name-function))) (compile command))) 
 I'm then using it thus:
 (defun ct/swift-build-command () (interactive) (ct/project-compile "swift build")) (define-key swift-mode-map (kbd "s-b") #'ct/swift-build-command) 
 (Could also use a lambda, but I don't mind the named function.)
  
How would you approach this? 
  
Not use (compile "swift build"), but drop down another level and use (compilation-start "swift build") directly?
 Locally let-override compile-command to be the command I want, e.g. "swift build"?

 Has anyone transitioned from imperative programming to functional programming (i.e, Haskell) professionally and made a significant improvement in how much they make? 
 I’m clueless on the job market for it and hoping to hear some personal stories.

I was curious to know how others have achieved this because often times I have citations in my notes and I want to refresh my memory so I would like to see the notes I took for that citation rather than just the pdf?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, looking to use Anaconda Python in Emacs again. Several years ago I was using elpy and it was pretty simple to set up. Now following these instructions, I include in my .emacs file:
 (setq-custom python-shell-interpreter "C:/ProgramData/Anaconda3/Scripts/jupyter.exe") (setq-custom python-shell-interpreter-args "console --simple-prompt") (setq python-shell-completion-native-enable nil) 
 but then I get
 Error executing Jupyter command 'console': [WinError 5] Access is denied 
 So I run Emacs in Administrator mode, but then I can't work with matplotlib.pyplot interactively because I think it's using a temporary graphics directory that is not anticipated by the Administrator account. 
 Anyone know how to fix it, or have it working another way? Or I wonder if switching to eglot or lsp-mode is better. According to this post, it's better to stick with language modes in Emacs if they exist and use the language server only for those that don't.
 Edit in case this isn't the case with everyone, using a regular python or ipython shell causes python to freeze when I generate plots wit the matplotlib.pyplot library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a data pipeline that does not use spark. A major challenge is debugging and replaying data. 
 I have buy in to refactor the data pipeline so that’s each steps inputs are serializable. I don’t really have bug-in to make everything truly spark based.
 My understanding is that spark works by essentially serializing objects and distributing them. It can even deal with functions (I’m aware of the memory consequences of poorly thinking about closure). 
 Would it be possible (relatively easy) to serialize instances of classes (steps in my data pipeline) to disk, and then build a test framework that deserializes those classes and allows me to debug and step through them later?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I'm very new to emacs and I wanted to try some of the tools available. I saw it has an ebook reader called nov (which seems to be the only maintained one) so I gave it a shot. I immediately noticed some issues with the rendering of the document. Here's a side by side of the exact same position in the book, rendered by nov on the left, and by zathura on the right, this is not a PDF, it's an epub file: https://i.imgur.com/KcYblln.png
 Notice the complety lack of formatting on the first paragraph, or rather, at all. I don't think I need to point out the problems, they are pretty clear on their own.
 How can I fix this? Is it even possible to fix it?
 This is all the configuration I have for nov:
 (setq nov-text-width 60) (setq visual-fill-column-center-text t) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.epub\\'" . nov-mode)) 
 I don't really know how to extend it to be honest, or anything at all. I understand very basic elisp (like function calls and setting variables) but that's it. I do have plenty of programming experience, I just don't know elisp well enough yet.
 I've searched through the internet but there's very few results, and the few there were kinda went over my head. Any help is appreciated, thanks.

They have support for Ruby On Rails, Javas, C# .etc and it's just a simple config change to get the whole thing wired up. DataDog provides some instruction on how to build our own span and add monitor where we need in codes but we just don't have the bandwidth to take on another tool we have to build.
 Perhaps, I might have missed something but it shouldn't be this hard to find an APM solution similar to what New Relic or DataDog offer for Haskell. Any suggestions, guys?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm looking for a 6 month unpaid internship with a company using Haskell (or Purescript or Elm) in production. The reason that I'm specifying that it be unpaid is that I'm doing it through the DoD Skillbridge program, which allows separating military servicemembers to intern with a private company for six months prior to the end of their contract. 
 I have a background in web development using Rails and a little React/Node, and I've been learning Haskell in my spare time. I've begun reaching out to companies that are already postured to work with Skillbridge interns, but I'm most excited about working in Haskell. 
 Do you have any suggestions about where I can find companies that would like to have a ~junior Haskell programmer and can support good quality mentorship? That company would have to register with the program but it's genuinely not difficult, just a bit slow.
 Edit: I would be available to start in May 2023; when a company signs up for the program, it can take 90-120 days to be approved, thus the lead time. I am a US citizen (in the US) but can relocate anywhere or work remotely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've been a long time user of Ivy and Counsel but a couple of days ago I decided to give Vertico, Embark and Consult a try. I'm very joyful with them so far, however I'm having a couple of issues: - 1. I've read that using Embark to collect a list of grep results should result in a grep-mode buffer. I used to use Ivy to produce an occur buffer which I could then edit allowing me to make changes across multiple files easily. Getting a grep-mode buffer sounded good to me as I could then use wgrep to edit these‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­matches directly in a similar way. However, when I collect these results (via embark-collect-live, embark-collect-snapshot or embark-export) I always end up with an embark-collect-mode buffer. I cannot see a way from here to make this a grep-mode buffer or to make changes to these matches in the same way I would in an editable occur buffer. 2. In the collected results as mentioned in the first question, if I press RET on any of these results I get the following error: Error running timer ‘consult--async-after-change’: (buffer-read-only #<buffer *Embark Collect*>). I'm currently using Emacs 28.0.50 and I use Evil mode. Any help on the above would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like the idea of only horizontally scrolling the current line, ie. (setq auto-hscroll-mode 'current-line), but it has a few quirks.
 First, if you scroll to the end of a long line, and then move to the next line, it will horizontally scroll that line, even if it easily fits on the screen. This pushes most of the short line off the left edge of the screen.
 Second, It would be nice for point to stay as far right as possible (at the left edge of the right margin) when horizontally scrolling. This would make it so point would stay a few columns from the right edge the entire time the line is horizontally scrolled. So even when moving point left, the line under point would horizontally scroll to the right until the line is no longer horizontally scrolling, then point would actually start moving toward the left edge of the screen.
 Does anyone know of such a thing? or can anyone help point me in the right direction to create a minor mode that would do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am tasked with writing a functor instance for the MyList type defined below, leaving its original structure as is.
 data MyList a = Elem a (MyList a) | Null (MyList a) | Done deriving Show 
 This is what I tried doing, by following this StackOverflow guide https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55191289/haskell-custom-functor-instance-on-data-type-with-function-constructor:
 instance Functor MyList where fmap f (Elem x xs) = Elem x xs fmap f (Null x) = Null x fmap f (Done) = Done 
 But this gives these errors:
 Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘b’
 ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
 the type signature for:
 fmap :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> MyList a -> MyList b
 at Main.hs:66:3-6
 ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
 the type signature for:
 fmap :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> MyList a -> MyList b
 at Main.hs:66:3-6
 Expected type: MyList b
 Actual type: MyList a
 • In the expression: Elem x xs
 In an equation for ‘fmap’: fmap f (Elem x xs) = Elem x xs
 In the instance declaration for ‘Functor MyList’
 • Relevant bindings include
 xs :: MyList a (bound at Main.hs:66:18)
 x :: a (bound at Main.hs:66:16)
 f :: a -> b (bound at Main.hs:66:8)
 fmap :: (a -> b) -> MyList a -> MyList b (bound at Main.hs:66:3)
 How do I write this properly?
 Edit: I've edited the functor code block after seeing u/TheSteelOverlord's comment.

 What I am looking for is to customize Org that way so while being on a bullet point
 RET creates a new one (like it usually is the case on other programs like Obsidian or Logseq)
 and C-RET (or M-RET) continues the bullet point across multiple lines (like it is the case on Logseq).
 Thank you in advance. Any help is appreciated.

 startx /usr/bin/emacs -geometry 223x58-0-0
 This command is a gift from the gods, all you could ever want. Set as an alias to 'emacs-tty'!
 The only downfall is the fonts... Not really sure what fonts can be used, and emojis aren't working. If anyone knows how to solve this that would be great.
 Other than that, stop torturing yourself with a non-graphical emacs!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a dieToInt function that converts Die values (that can be between One and Six) to an integer.
 This is a helper function for roll2int that returns the sum of a list of Die values.
 So, roll2int [One, Two, Three] should return 1+2+3=3+3=6.
 --{-3} data Die = One | Two | Three | Four | Five | Six deriving (Show, Eq) --{-3a} type Dice = [Die] --{-3b} Check roll2int definition dieToInt :: Die -> Int dieToInt One = 1 dieToInt Two = 2 dieToInt Three = 3 dieToInt Four = 4 dieToInt Five = 5 dieToInt Six = 6 roll2int :: Dice -> Int roll2Int _ = 0 roll2Int dice = sum (map dieToInt dice) 
 I tried using this print statement print(roll2int[One, Two, Three]) in the main function to test, but I get an error message:
 Main.hs:46:1: error: The type signature for ‘roll2int’ lacks an accompanying binding Perhaps you meant ‘roll2Int’ (Defined at Main.hs:47:1) | 46 | roll2int :: Dice -> Int 
 I gave a definition and an implementation of roll2die, so what is the issue?
 This is for a homework assignment.

 ​
 I just started using it on another computer, and although it works fine for the first buffer I open in a project, every subsequent buffer that I open highlights an error that one of the included libraries is "not found." I use CMake, so I've pointed to the build/compile_commands.json, which seems to be picked up when I open the first buffer, but for some reason, every other buffer after the first does not see it _unless_ I restart the workspace.
 ​
 Summary:
 I need to restart my lsp workspace in every buffer after the first in a project for it to pick up the correct compile_commands.json, but it seems to work on another computer.
 I'm not sure what I can do to debug this, since the logs printed to clangd::stderr and lsp-log don't show anything abnormal. Anyone have any pointers on where I can look next?

 An example would be the use of the introduction of the ghc-bignum package. I recall reading about some kind of "regression" regarding the readability of some common compiler errors, but I can't seem to find it now.

 I wanted to share a new tool I've created for playing around with the diagrams library (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagrams) to visualize an implementation of the scanline-stack flood fill algorithm.
 The core of the algorithm is borrowed from rosetta code:
 https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Bitmap/Flood_fill#Haskell
 Please check out the GitHub repository below for more details, and to try it out yourself!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to, in a point-free manner, create a function that takes in an Int and a function (a->a) and that produces the list with the function applied to it. 
 This is the original function: g x y = [ y z | z <- [1..x]]
 My first thought was:
 g' = flip take $ iterate (+1) 1 --This would create a partially applied function which takes in an Int to create a list of that length.
 However I'm not sure how to apply a function to this list. Since the value produced by g' is not an actual list, I can't make it the input of fmap or map. I'm not sure how to continue from here. 
 In a perfect world I'd write
 g = flip fmap $ flip take $ iterate (+1) 1
 and then call
 g (+1) 3 which would produce [2,3,4], but it doesn't. Any help would be appreciated.

 This could be a odd late night thought, but is there a way to make Buffer A only displayed in one Window at a time? In my above example, Window 2 currently would display Buffer A and so would Window 1. I want Window 1 to display something else, perhaps another buffer I have opened or even some default value when Buffer A is opened in Window 2.

As consultants, we see that nearly all of our clients that are using Nix are, at best, annoyed by the accidental complexity that comes with it.
Some of them even decide to back off because of that, leaving with a nondescript feeling that Nix is not something to be used for solving real-world problems.
It appears the Nix ecosystem has now reached a point where it can either become a credible player in the industry or get stuck with being labeled “research-quality”, a proof of concept, not suitable for serious use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While operations like pulling in my Inbox causes everything to momentarily freeze, I could live with this.
 But, sometimes, Wanderlust will just freeze without provocation and I'll end up having to dump my Emacs and open it, again.
 This can consistently happen, without fail, if the internet connection drops (which, unfortunately, mine does often).
 Does anyone know of any workaround for this? I don't know if it's a fair comparison or not but I actually don't remember Gnus locking up my Emacs, at all (or, at least, in any way that didn't pass relatively soon), let alone causing a crash.

After digging into the GHC source distribution, I'm pretty sure it is aarch64-apple-macos-*, but I can't figure out what the ABI should be. I also see aarch64-apple-darwin14 in the source.

("What is incremental writing" )


This video demonstrates the critical idea of deconstructing or digesting reading and using the components or nutrients as building blocks for writing/idea creation and synthesis. It goes over the process with a lapidarist skill. Reading and writing are not something that abides by a deadline but is enjoyable without time pressures. It is rewarding to write on three-year-old ideas and see them pop up in a review queue. Reminiscence is falling in love all over again. New note:
What is meant by reminiscing 202207302048
I want to consider the prioritization aspects of zettelkasting in this video. I see his point about how with everything prioritized and working from a prioritized list, you can be sure what time you spend zettelkasting is in the areas you have made your highest priorities.
I've not felt the need to set zettelkasting priorities formally, have you?]]></summary>

 The default result of org-publish-all is to build a single posts.html. Is there a way to split up top-level headings into their own html pages?
 One thought I had was to write an elisp function that does this prior to the publishing function being called, but I'd rather avoid that solution as it's another step in the build process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Non-coder vim-enthusiast. New to zettelkasten. Actually struggling less with zettelkasten, at least at the moment, than vim. Specifically with getting syncing going between vim installations on iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.
Vim on the mobile devices is actually iVim, an amazing porting of vim to the iOS environment. It has a command (:iexdir) that, in spite of Apple’s sandboxing, makes it possible to establish connections with external directories. I’ve used it to set up a connection to iCloud Drive. My intention was to enable syncing between my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook..
I’ve adopted wiki.vim as my writing plugin of choice. I requires that I place a path to to the root directory in my .vimrc. With a lot of trial-and-error and pleas for help I’ve tried without success to identify a workable path to the directory I’ve placed in iCloud Drive.
At one point I thought I’d discovered a workable path in a file in iVim’s system directories. It is “ /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/BBD512C7-CCA0-47FD-B2F2-0AF17D9D03B5/Documents/wiki”. Alas, iVim does not recognize the path.
I desperation, wanting to move on from fiddling with technology to must writing, I’ve signed up for Bear Notes, mainly for the syncing between devices it provides. I feel like a traitor. I would much prefer to continue experimenting with zettelkasten with vim as my companion.
I write in the unlikely chance, and the desperate hope, that someone here might be able to point me to a solution.
Thanks in any case.]]></summary>

forking the repo - this you do on github then save the links to the original project and your fork? 
 clone your fork (or original?) regular magit can do the clone, or commandline, or forge?
 add the original project remote calling it upstream if you cloned your own copy (or perhaps adding your fork as another remote if you cloned the original?)
 hereafter everything can be done in forge or do any of you still switch to browser for some things?

I recently installed emacs 28.1 with native comp on Arch in wslg, and noticed that everything, even small files, were slowing to a crawl when scrolling. A profile showed that linum-mode was to blame. I disabled it and voilá, yeah, everything was smooth. That got me puzzled, since I expected that having linum-mode native would make it faster, not slower (though I understand things are not that simple, specially in a VM).
 Now I had to switch to display-line-numbers-mode, which works perfectly, but, as many others, I really don't like the positioning.
 Any ideas? Either of speeding up linum-mode or changing position of display-line-numbers-mode,

 It is basically just to add your vault files to .gitattributes with something like /**/vault.yml diff=ansible-vault merge=binary and changing git settings with git config --global diff.ansible-vault.textconv "ansible-vault view. This works perfectly in the terminal, but has the side effect that vault changes no longer appear in Magit diffs.
 Does anybody know how to make this work in our lovely Magit?

Al of a sudden this seems to give problems when starting emacs on fedora36 (standard install from the fedora repos) stating the following error: org-compat.el: Error: Wrong number of arguments (3 . 4)
 I found some stuff about a change in a macro or function with the switch to emacs 28 but I do not understand why I start to get this now weeks after switching to fedora 36. 
 It also is not clear how I can solve this, how to get the latest org-mode (wasn't that included in emacs ?) and why it only starts creating problems now 
 Can I delete the 20171205 version?

HJKL to move around is great, I love it, they are aligned and side by side. When I switch to BÉPO (the DVORAK keyboard layout of the French) I lose all my shortcuts. I can then write a lot of rammapage settings but they won't work from one program to another. And it's very frustrating, ugly, not functional with some plugins. I use VIM shortcuts on vscode, and other software. I want to stay flexible in case I change IDE in a company for example.
 Anyway, I don't dare to change my keyboard layout just because of vim.
 I wanted to know if Emacs was also a problem when changing the keyboard layout. 
 PS: I recently bought a mechanical keyboard with layer keys (the Dygma Defy), so I'm wondering about leaving vim even though I like it a lot

I already have: GitHub, GitLab (exactly like GitHub), OrgModeWeb, Orgzly, Orgro, Emacs, vim-orgmode. What I need is information on much more tools. I have set up a syntax checking file on GitHub which also contains my current compatibility table for the most basic set that makes sense as a Markdown-pendant outside of Emacs according to my subjective judgement on Org mode at the bottom. My focus is on tools that - at least - offer text formatting syntax highlighting for *bold* /italic/ and so forth. The rest could be "works as text but has no special support for outlining and more". The goals is to emphasize that there are much more tools ‏‏‎ that allow for viewing and/or editing data in Org mode syntax. Since I don't have an iPhone, iOS-based tools supporting Org mode syntax is very much appreciated. Please do hand in more lines for the table either here, via email or as a GitHub pull request.

 Here is it: https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module
 My main motivation (except for learning, of course) was writing some UI extensions for Emacs using this approach. This is something I'll play with next.
 If I got you interested and you want to help with it, or simply give it a try, please do! And don't hesitate to reach out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello text wizards,
 I recently switched to Vertico, Consult, Orderless, Embark, Marginalia as a completion framework.
 One hurdle I came across is Projectile. I use projectile often (I prefer the extra functionality it has over project.el). But how do I integrate Projectile with all this. For Ivy there is counsel-projectile which overrides most projectile functionality and work awesome. For consult there is consult-projectile but it seems a bit lacking compared to counsel-projectile.
 ​
 Is there a better alternative? or am I missing something with this completion framework and I should combine more consult and embark functionality with projectile somehow?
 Do you use projectile with a similar completion stack? If so do you have any advice of config files to share?
 ​
 [EDIT] My bad after taking a deeper look to respond to u/bespokey I realized that they are pretty similar not sure why I thought they were more. My bad.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have start using alists then plists for managing some of my data in Emacs and they seem quite slow, especially with plists, but I'm not sure where the delay is and I may be using it an inefficient manner.
 All I know is that for the small amounts of data involved it is not as fast as I expect, and in any case I expect my data to grow beyond its capabilities.
 Since plists and JSON look pretty much alike do guys think that managing the data with JSON may be a good idea? I was going to talk about redis but learned that redis doesn't use JSON as its native data format, but can use the JSON data format as well.
 Are there some external modules that Emacs can them with for better performance?
 How much data can savehist handle efficiently? I have a feeling I may be abusing it for something it is not intended for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I would like to ditch Ivy/Counsel for Vertico. There is a package called "helpful" that I had configured like so:
 (use-package helpful :after counsel :bind ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key) ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command) ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable) ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function) :custom (counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable) (counsel-describe-variable-function #'helpful-variable)) 
 The package was used to improve the default help system by providing more contextual information.
 I think I need to remove the counsel related lines. Right? However, I'm not sure how to map the keys in that case.
 The github page for helpful package says:
 ;; Note that the built-in `describe-function' includes both functions ;; and macros. `helpful-function' is functions only, so we provide ;; `helpful-callable' as a drop-in replacement. (global-set-key (kbd "C-h f") #'helpful-callable) (global-set-key (kbd "C-h v") #'helpful-variable) (global-set-key (kbd "C-h k") #'helpful-key) 
 So that means that I don't need to use remap describe-variable and remap describe-function?

 I didn't mind having extra long columns in the editor, but wanted some escape sequences that cause the output to break into multiple lines in the table cells.
 Imagine my surprise when asked a few days ago and got an answer and got a response from u/redblobgames. Big up to him (I hope I haven't misgendered him 😮).
 There is the solution, right there in the manual
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Quoting-HTML-tags.html
 and you guys kept it from me for ages.
 I even thought it was a new feature recently introduced into org but it seems to have been around forever - and you guys kept it from me.
 You have been bad naughty boys. No cookies for you.

Besides, installing EAF feels like exiting emacs entirely. I have seen some things done with xwidget-webkit that seem cool, and this is already integrated into emacs (although I would have to compile it myself). I am wondering what is the bleeding-edge browser experience available in emacs right now (that one could install from one of the repos like MELPA or by compiling emacs with certain options). Alternatively, I have also heard of Nyxt. Could Nyxt be used instead of emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm new to emacs and have been working my way through various Info manuals I find interesting. Right now I'm on the "eintr" one (the intro to Lisp one). In section 4.1 "Finding More Information", it says the following:
 For example, ‘xref-find-definitions’ will jump to the various nodes in the Texinfo source file of this document (provided that you’ve run the ‘etags’ utility to record all the nodes in the manuals that come with Emacs; see (emacs)Create Tags Table). 
 When I try the command M-. it puts this in the minibuffer:
 Visit tags table (default TAGS): /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/28.1/share/info/emacs/ 
 Which I interpret to mean I do not have a TAGS file already generated for the Info pages.
 If I navigate to:
 /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/28.1/share/info/emacs 
 And then do:
 etags eintr.info.gz 
 It does create a TAGS file, but it doesn't look right. Every line starts with "function", which makes me think etags interpreted this as the wrong language. I'm assuming the language expected is texinfo (based on the Info pages own text), so I tried manually specifying the language:
 etags -l texinfo eintr.info.gz 
 But it creates an almost-empty TAGS file.
 Now I'm kind of stumped. Anyone have any ideas how I can get tags working within Info mode? Thanks!

 lsp-eslint-server-command is a variable defined in lsp-eslint.el. Value ("node" "~/server/out/eslintServer.js" "--stdio") 
 (I don't have a ~/server/out/eslintServer.js directory. That's seems to be the default though.)
 When I run lsp-install-server, I get this in Messages buffer:

 While this is PureScript related, I'm posting here since I suspect a large part of the community lurks around here as well.
 While doing PureScript, I found translating HTML snippets (e.g. Tailwind components) tedious and needed a tool to help with that. Since I couldn't find any, I made one.
 You can try it out here https://purescriptify.web.app/
 Code is at https://github.com/dnikolovv/purescriptify
 It's pretty basic, but I'm surprised at how good it gets the job done. It can be extended to support other flavors as well, e.g. Halogen.

 emacs-groundup snapshot
 Hi,
 A while ago, I had introduced emacs-groundup - an emacs spin aimed at elisp novices. Happy to announce its first versioned release! To re-iterate its objectives:
  
Provides a solid, ootb workflow for task and project management.
 Pre-configured for Julia and python programming - supports both REPL and notebook based workflows.
 Ideal for users looking to 'try emacs'. It can be used as-is by setting only a handful of (including zero) parameters.
 May interest 'experienced' elisp novices and/or emacs novices 'looking to get serious'. The code is amply commented, and package configurations are as decoupled as possile. Perfect to learn how to write elisp and how to configure some of the more commonly-used packages.
  
Give it a go! All user feedback and contributions are welcome.

 What I would like to do is to show the capture window when pressing ns as is now, but then when I save it with C-c C-c also add, automatically, the date of the actual save (time when C-c C-c was pressed. And possibly the difference in minutes (I don't need seconds) between the time of pressing ns and C-c C-c.
 So, in the end it would look like this: 
  (setq org-capture-templates '(("n" "Note") ("ns" "Special note" entry (file+datetree "~/Documents/notes.org") "**** %<%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M:%S> - %H2:%M2:%S2 (duration: 12 minutes) \n%?" :tree-type week) )) 
 How to do something like that? Is it even possible in org-capture?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before I submit a bug report, I'd like to confirm that others experience the same behavior and the issue is not just happening for me.
 How to reproduce:
  
Open a buffer with the following contents:
 #+PRIORITIES: 1 35 1 * foo 
 
With the cursor on the heading in line 3, cycle through the priorities with S-Up / S-Down
 
 Expected behavior:
 The priorities should cycle in a range of 1-35
 Actual behavior:
 The priorities only cycle in a range of 1-3. I suspect that only the first character of 35 is parsed, because usually only one character is necessary
 Emacs Version: 26.3
 OS: Ubuntu 20.04
 Edit:
 Some additional info: I'm refering to this documentation. It both says that numeric priorities must be smaller than 65 and has an example where it specifies '#+PRIORITIES 1 10 5'. Unfortunately, this example will cycle in a range of 1-1 for me. So according to the docs my example should work, but since 'C-c ,' also only expects one input, perhaps the docs don't reflect the actual (and valid) behavior.

 While perusing through Emacs’ built in features through “C-h p” documentation I found out there were several template and snippet tools built into Emacs. Three of them to be exact tempo, skeletons and expand. I’ve never actually dived into many of these features. After reading about them and experimenting with them deeper I have noticed how powerful they are. Aside from lack of documentation most of them are not used widely because they lack a good collection of snippets for various modes. This repo aims to give a good documentation and a set of snippets that could easily be copied by users to help them get started on using Emacs’ built in code templating and snippet tools.
 Feel free to add your own if have any that you use daily.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wa73du/i_am_unable_to_remap_m1_or_m2_to_my_shortcuts_in/
 This question has been seen 1700 times and has a 100% upvote rate as you can see here: https://i.imgur.com/pAdhWeQ.png , yet there is not a single answer (outside of my 1 comment asking people what do they need more to be able to help).
 My question to you is, what should I formulate differently, or what other information should I bring in so the question would attract at least 1 answer.
 Or, should I put more effort into titles? Do Emacs enthusiasts appreciate a witty titles like "A meta question about meta keys question" more than "Why doesn't my question about meta keys rebinding get any answers?" Do the feel that responding/helping/interacting with a person who puts effort into titles will be more enjoyable, worth spending their time than talking to somebody whose titles are "ordinary"?
 I shared this question on Spacemacs subredit as well, but only 2 guys who are even less experienced than me tried to help, but as I said, they didn't have any deep knowledge about Emacs at all, they were beginners as one of them admitted.
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I recently learnt that magit does tags! I am wondering, how does one tag a remote branch though? I have gone through the manual but couldn't figure it out. Maybe some more experienced folk here can help me?
 Also, is there any way one can do gitlab release tags from magit? Seeing as it is probably a gitlab-specific implementation rather than a feature in git proper, am I right in assuming that this is not possible ?
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't often use Slack, but I joined the FP workspace and there is a Scala channel.
 Some days ago a person asked if there is any weekly/monthly online Meetup on Scala, or something.
 I have the same question so I'm asking on here so we can cover more ground.
 I'm just started with Scala and I wish I could meet and integrate with the community (if there is one online).
 I'm currently working with Elixir, there is a lot of channels and meetups where people discuss books and frameworks, and even some book clubs where they read something together and meet once a week or a month to discuss each chapter.
 I would guess that this other person was looking for something like this when he asked, and I'm too.
 But I couldn't find much "movement" on the medium I have found so far, I didn't tried the Discord channel though, as I don't use Discord but I guess that maybe the biggest community is over there?
 What do you guys suggest? There is something else or somewhere else to check? Do you know about something?

 I have this custom backend I'm working on:
 (defun company-sample-backend (command &optional arg &rest ignored) (interactive (list 'interactive)) (let ((people (org-ql-select (concat org-dir "/contacts.org") '(level 1) :action #'org-get-heading))) (cl-case command (interactive (company-begin-backend 'company-sample-backend)) (prefix (and (eq major-mode 'org-mode) (company-grab-symbol))) (candidates (my/contacts-candidates arg)) (post-completion (company-thing arg))))) 
 It works well, so far. However, what I'd like is to have this backend "kick in" only when I press @. I'm not entirely sure how to achieve this. I assume it needs to be done in the prefix logic, but my attempts don't seem to work. I'm hoping someone has done this and can show me the (probably simple) solution.
 Thanks!

 I'm attempting to write my own custom backend which reads from an org file, grabs all the top-level headings and displays them in the company-mode popup as selection candidates. 
 I have this working pretty well, but I was wondering if it was possible to (once the candidate has been selected) have the insert text (what actually gets placed into the buffer) changed or otherwise manipulated in some other way so that the value is different from the selection candidate.
 I was under the impression post-completion would allow this, but it doesn't seem to work. Here's my defun:
 (defun company-sample-backend (command &optional arg &rest ignored) (interactive (list 'interactive)) (let ((people (org-ql-select (concat org-dir "/contacts.org") '(level 1) :action #'org-get-heading))) (cl-case command (interactive (company-begin-backend 'company-sample-backend)) (prefix (and (eq major-mode 'org-mode) (company-grab-symbol))) (candidates (my/contacts-candidates arg)) (post-completion (company-thing arg)))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Haskell Compiler for DSL] Hey folks, I'm in the ideation phase of building a new FP DSL, "Sense" that compiles to Kotlin/JS/Swift. The idea is simple: create software by expressing only the absolute necessary information and not a line above.
  
Value proposition: a few lines in Sense are hundreds of lines in Kotlin.
  
The purpose we're creating SenseLang is because we want to create a "SoftwareBuilder" website where you can create mobile, web, and backend apps via UI + some simple DSL (Sense).
 Tradeoffs: + Pros: Correctness, simplicity - Cons: Performance, security
 https://github.com/ILIYANGERMANOV/sense-lang
 If that grabbed your attention, I'd really appreciate some feedback! If I'm not crazy and someone also likes the idea - we'd be happy to find more contributors and co-founders.
 Motivation: - FP - Haskell (compiler) - Elm - Jetpack Compose

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just published the data-elevator package on hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-elevator-0.1.0.0
 It's the result of a joint brainstorming session at ZuriHac with Andreas Klebinger, Krzysztof Gogolewski and Matthew Craven (remotely). See this thread for details: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21693 
 You can use its Strict :: LiftedType -> UnliftedType and Lazy :: LiftedType -> UnliftedType newtypes (!) to turn any lifted type into an unlifted (boxed) type like Array# and vice versa.
 Example:
 let f :: (a :: UnliftedType) -> Int f _ = 42 in f (Strict (error "boom" :: Int)) 
 This will error out with "boom". While the following
 let f :: a -> Int f _ = 42 in f (Lazy (error "boom" :: Array# Int)) 
 will not error and return 42 instead. (Do note though that unlifted primitives like Array# currently don't have enter code and any eval of Lazy will crash, https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21792).
 I added a Coercible-like type, LevitySubsumption that allows to coerce some functions along the subkinding relationship Unlifted <: Lifted lifted over BoxedRep, TYPE and then (->). The only axioms are Strict a <: a and a <: Lazy a. With that in place, I can do call-by-value on any existing lazy function:
 even :: Int -> Bool strictEven :: Strict Int -> Bool strictEven = levCoerce @(Int -> Bool) @(Strict Int -> Bool) even even 42 strictEven (Strict 42) 
 See also https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-elevator-0.1.0.0/docs/Data-Elevator.html#v:levCoerce. It's pretty interesting; constructing a coercion like that is very much what I would like GHC to do by itself one day, without any visible trace of levCoerce if possible (inferrable).
 Do note that this code uncovered a few bugs in GHC, so give it a few GHC releases before you actually use this library in production.

This past week found me doing:
It may not seem like it from the list of new zettel below, but I've been deeply reading and interconnecting within my ZK travel books and travel essays. Mainly on a philosophical level. I started reading "The Narrow Road To The Deep North," considered one of the foundational books of travel writing.
I started migrating code snippets to The Archive.
Developed two new Keyboard Maestro macros.
Onboarded, from pre-ZK notes, "Not Caring What Other People Think is a Super Power" by Ed Latimore. There is a 5-year rest between reading and onboarding to ZK. Plenty of time for the ideas to swim around. I don't think the long rest hurt my comprehension of the ideas I highlighted in 2017.
My plans for this coming week:
I read about and have been convinced to try a "Full Screen" workflow, and I'm giving it a try.
Work on sharing my advanced search querying macros.
Onboard the two books I'm reading to my ZK


The Narrow Road To The Deep North by Matsuo Basho - Travel Journal
The Book Of Form And Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki - Fiction

Finish migrating code snippets to The Archive.
Here are a few of the titles of zettel I've been working on last week.

 I have a function in C called prtVector:
 void prtVector(Vector2 vec) { printf("Vector coordinates: (%f, %f)", vec.x, vec.y); } 
 When I try to import it in Haskell I get an error:
 foreign import ccall "prtVector" printVector :: Vector2 -> IO () 
 'Vector2' cannot be marshalled in a foreign call
 I believe this is because I have to pass the vector by pointer, but I just wanted to make sure.
 This would fix it, but I wanted to check if there's a better way:
 void prtVectorPtr(Vector2* vec) { prtVector(*vec); } 
 Haskell:
 foreign import ccall "prtVectorPtr" printVector :: Ptr Vector2 -> IO ()

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using GHC 9.0.2 (via stackage LTS-19.16) with LLVM 12. That is the only version of LLVM officially supported by this GHC version that can be installed on a Mac M1 with homebrew. MacOS is 12.4 (Monterey). I installed GHC 9.0.2 for this platform using GHCUP. Generally things work great with this setup.
 Joey Hess' zxcvbn-c package is a thin Haskell binding for a simple C library. The Hackage package comes complete with the original C library, including the makefile, and this builds and tests fine with LLVM 12.
 But when I compile the Haskell library, I get the following LLVM failure:
 ...//var/folders/1d/z681kt9160xbwtytsvwvl2dh0000gn/T/ghc14575_0/ghc_1.s:2495:7: error: error: invalid type suffix for instruction udot.2s v1, v0, v8 ^ | 2495 | udot.2s v1, v0, v8 | ^ <no location info>: error: Error running clang! you need clang installed to use the LLVM backend (or GHC tried to execute clang incorrectly) `clang' failed in phase `Clang (Assembler)'. (Exit code: 1) 
 I am using this work-around for the libffi problem:
 export C_INCLUDE_PATH="`xcrun --show-sdk-path`/usr/include/ffi" 
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have been volunteered to take a parallel and functional programming class in Uni. For the functional bit we are using Scala. So far so good, but the Syntax for function declarations our prof showed us differs from the book and most other sources I´ve found.
 For instance our function declarations are
 def functionName: type => type = inputName => outputName //for example absolute value function def abs: Int => Int = x => x match{ case x if x < 0 => -x case x => x } 
 While in the book
 // V brackets are used def sum(xs: List[Int]): Int = xs match case Nil => 0 case head :: tail => head + sum(tail) 
 Are these just alternate ways to express the same thing? Is my prof using some other version of Scala?
 Any pointers where I could find more information?
 Thanks in advance.

 I am trying to swap the modeline with the headerline completely.
 For now I use this snippet of code to have my modeline in my headerline and vice-versa :  (defvar og-modeline mode-line-format) (setq-default mode-line-format header-line-format) (setq-default header-line-format og-modeline)  This works well except that I'd like to see the empty modeline (as a separator) but it doesn't show because header-line-format is empty. Is it possible to have an empty string and keep the header-line-format ?
 My other problem is that lsp-headerline still shows in the real header-line which I don't want to. Do you know how I could move it down there ?
 Maybe there is a better way to swap the modeline and the headerline ?
 Thank you for your help

I like to read a lot of articles and research papers and I have been setting up org roam for the same purpose. I have purchased an iPad recently to increase my productivity(watching lectures on youtube and reading some articles in my free time or while I am traveling). 
 Do you guys have any suggestions on using org roam with iPad for notetaking? I could not find anything on the internet apart from an indirect integration via logseq. 
 I am sure some of you would have faced similar issues. Any suggestion is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was a strong opponent of monorepos for quite a while, but now in a position where it works extremely well:
  
We're a small team of two
 The project (typical CRUD) is new and fairly small - we need to iterate fast
 Almost every feature requires a change on both backend and frontend
 Backend is source of truth for types on frontend (backend generated OpenAPI definition with tapir, frontend takes it with orval)
  
All that to say that I don't think we're going to multi-repo for now.
 Now, does anyone have advices how to organize a Scala + TypeScript monorepo? Right now it's sbt project with completely independent npm project in frontend dir:
  / modules/ - our Scala code backend/ - the actual backend, depends on all other modules gcp/ - some smaller modules with narrow scope build.sbt - Scala project defintiion frontend/ - our TypeScript (frontend) code src/ package.json README.md 
 It works, but feels a bit disbalanced, like plain Scala project with some assets in frontend dir.
 Ideally, I'd like to see something like:
  / frontend/ backend/ something.build - instructions how to build both B&F, no idea what tool would it be README.md 
 Would it be better with things like Nx or Bazel? Or is there a good way to build npm project with sbt. Some approach with Nix would also work if its usage is optional for fronend dev cycle (junior on frontend). Perhaps the only requirement is a good GitHub Actioins integration.

        <updated>2022-07-30T22:59:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I currently have these settings in my init.el:
 (require 'package) (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") ("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))) (package-initialize) 
 From what I read the "org" repository has been deprecated and there is no need for it anymore.
 As you can see, I do not have the package-archive-priorities defined in my config so I have no idea in which order my packages are fetched. I used Emacs like this for nearly two years until recently I discovered that package-archive-priorities exists, so I would like to make it part of my init.el now.
 I rewrote my package config:
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("nongnu" . "https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/")) (setq package-archive-priorities '(("melpa" . 3) ("gnu" . 2) ("nongnu" . 1))) (package-initialize) 
 The reason I add "Non GNU" is for Emacs 27. Yes, I know that Emacs 28+ doesn't require that.
 I set the highest priority for MELPA. I'm using the numbers 3, 2, and 1 for priorities. Is there anything wrong with that kind of numbering? Just asking because most init.el configs I saw online used larger integers like 100, 50, and 25. Should I use the larger numbers instead? or it doesn't matter?
 Also, is there anything wrong in using the MELPA as the archive with the highest priority? I noticed that If I choose GNU ELPA as the main archive, the version of the company package that gets installed is an older version. It seems to me that the packages in MELPA are more up-to-date. The "Non GNU" archive doesn't seem to be a replacement for MELPA, at least not for now.

 Coming from pySpark I've kind of been exposed to Scala. It doesn't seem as boring as Java & looks like it'll keep me away from devolving into 'CloudCorp Data Engg'. 
 So... are there many Data Engg types who become scala devs. Obviously not if they can't code. But what could you do to leverage the Scala part of Spark into a gig? 
 I'm thinking learning Akka, basic scala, l33tcode, getting a junior type of gig, move to Switzerland,.....? Thanks for reading.

 That's really it! I just wanted to share the win here. This matters in case you have to do full remote development, considerably more than a few edits and commands with TRAMP which is also a fantastic builtin utility and daily driver for me.
 One thing it doesn't do, and I'm not sure it can on the MacOS terminal emulator is differentiate TAB and C-i which matters for folks that use org and evil. My solution was to rebind org-cycle to "q" (default is vim macro recording which I don't typically use). 
 Anywho that's it, just wanted to post a success story here.

 Those of you in a situation similar to mine, how do you press shortcuts like M-v or M-x (this one is particularly painful)?

 Edit: I can't remap caps lock to esc because I don't have that key.

 First, emacs seems to litter my config folder with its own stuff. I want this folder to be backed up in my dotfiles repo, and I don't want extra stuff in it. Neovim for instance uses the config directory as "read only". It reads the configuration, and anything that it needs to save (like swap files, plugin data or even the plugins themselves) go into the .local/share/neovim directory. This is neat because it keeps the config tidy. Is there any way to make emacs do that?

 Main changes
  
more interactivity in the TUI interface
 fixes for darwin with ld override and ability to pass configure args to bindist
 many improvements to ghcup compile hls, hopefully making it a better alternative to bindists, see https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/guide/#hls
  
Breaking changes
 To improve installation safety, some changes have been made. Some buggy hadrian bindists are now unsupported. GHCup has fixed those bindists here: https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghcup/unofficial-bindists/ghc/curated/
 The fix is also upstreamed in newer versions of GHC.

 More things are general by default, and special cases don’t take up convenient names. E. g. fmap is called map, and Prelude’s map is just an instance, without special treatment.
 Strings are vectors of UTF-8 (= Text?).
 (Almost?) no lists. Vector as the default data structure + Foldable and Traversable for lazy sequential operations.
 foldl means foldl', and I’m not sure the lazy version belongs in a prelude at all.
 A point or a matrix can be made Num. Something closer to numeric-prelude instead of just Num.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following type representing formal linear combinations of the type b with coefficients in a:
 data FreeModule b a = MkFreeModule (Map b a) -- | A smart constructor that removes zero coefficients fromMap :: (Num a, Eq a) => Map b a -> FreeModule b a fromMap m = MkFreeModule (Map.filter (/= 0) m) toMap :: FreeModule b a -> Map b a toMap (MkFreeModule m) = m -- fromList, toList defined similarly, definitions omitted 
 A FreeModule admits an addition operation:
 add :: (Ord b, Num a, Eq a) => FreeModule b a -> FreeModule b a -> FreeModule b a add u v = fromMap $ Map.unionWith (+) (toMap u) (toMap v) 
 If b is a Monoid, we can also define a multiplication operation:
 mul :: (Ord b, Monoid b, Num a, Eq a) => FreeModule b a -> FreeModule b a -> FreeModule b a mul v1 v2 = fromList $ do (b1,a1) <- toList v1 (b2,a2) <- toList v2 pure (b1 <> b2, a1*a2) 
 Now, it would be very convenient to be able to use (+) for addition, and (*) for multiplication. So I want to do something like this:
 instance (Ord b, Num a, Eq a) => Num (FreeModule b a) where (+) = add (*) = if b is an instance of Monoid then mul else error "Can't multiply FreeModules since b is not a Monoid" 
 The last few lines are nonsense -- my question is whether it is possible to actually do something like this. The convenience of using (+) syntax is high enough that I am perfectly happy to have multiplication throw a runtime error when no Monoid instance is available. But it would also be nice to use mul when a Monoid instance is available.
 I guess the ideal situation would be if (+) and (*) were not methods in the same typeclass. Then I could have instance (Ord b, Num a, Eq a) => Add (FreeModule b a) ... and instance (Ord b, Monoid b, Num a, Eq a) => Mul (FreeModule b a) ..., but I don't want to go the route of defining my own numeric hierarchy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write some exotic characters, like ĵ, ĉ or ŭ. I am using a qwerty US keyboard layout on a GNU linux machine, and I set up my compose key with setxkbmap -layout us -option compose:ralt. This works flawlessly almost everywhere, including when using Emacs from a terminal with emacs -q -nw. I can write words like "ĵaŭdo" ("thursday" in Esperanto), no problem at all.
 But when I try to input the compose sequence corresponding to one of those characters using Emacs in GUI mode with emacs -q, nothing happens. Clearly, Emacs GUI understands my compose key, as I can use it to write french characters like "déjà". Furthermore, it does not seem to be a character set issue: If I write "ĵaŭdo" in a text file, and open this file from Emacs GUI, it renders those characters just fine. Does anybody know what is going here? (emacs --version GNU Emacs 28.1`)

From what I understand Scala is mostly used in processing big data, so knowing only Scala syntax won't help you with landing a job, right? So that leads me to another question: what should I learn in order to land a job in Scala ecosystem, besides language syntax, libraries etc ?

 If I have tabs A, B and C open in that order, I want to open them again in that order after closing emacsclient. The tabs should also still open the same buffers that were open in them before. 
 My understanding is that desktop-mode can do this, but (desktop-save-mode) in my .emacs config only reloads buffers and doesn't open the last used buffer in the current window. 
 How do I save tab-bar-mode layout in emacs? 
 Edit: I should also specify I use emacs exclusively in terminal mode for a few reasons that would take too long to explain
 Edit 2: clarification 
 Edit 3: I found that it DOES work with GUI emacs, but not terminal emacs. Is there any workaround or plugin which will work?

 I usually build Emacs from source every so often, I tried today after pulling and got a strange issue during the make process.
 I'll spare you the super long macro unraveling but I got this issue: 
 Loading macroexp.elc... Internal native compiler error: "../../lisp/international/titdic-cnv.el", "failing to compile function", #<symbol titdic- convert at 16545>, "gcc_jit_context_new_call_through_ptr: not enough arguments to fn_ptr: freloc- >R6e6172726f772d746f2d726567696f6e_narrow_to_region_0 (got 2 args, expected 3)" 
 and several similar issues related to gcc_jit_context_new_call_through_ptr not receiving the proper number of arguments.
 This happened with:
  
Emacs pulled today (July 29th 2022)
 libgccjit 12.1.0-3 (on Manjaro Linux, installed with sudo pacman -S libgccjit)
 gcc 12.1.0-3 (on Manjaro Linux, installed with the package manager as well)
  
Since I'm not seeing posts everywhere of people failing to build from source, I expect this is an issue with libgccjit. 
 Can anyone replicate this behavior and has any tips to fix it?
 Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 Is it possible to have a web-based interactive overlay inside a text buffer in Emacs? 
 Something similar in UX to how images or org-transclusion overlays are displayed inside org-mode buffers. I am looking specifically for in-place rendering, not in a separate buffer. My use case is rendering html export blocks inside an org file to have an interactive notebook like experience, without exporting the whole document to html and viewing it in a browser. 
 This would allow one to use Emacs as a self-sufficient interactive environment, bringing interactive plots, boards, diagrams, graphs, tables etc. directly into already powerful text editing environment. This functionality exists a priori in web-based applications like Obsidian, VS Code (even with inline web-views), but those either become slower with each notebook cell, have json as a file format, or do not have serious text editing capabilities. I realize that such overlays are niceties, and one can always export and view the documents, but I believe that the described approach is alluring to many because it does not force one to split their thinking between creating and viewing.
 If there is no such package at the moment, I would be willing to implement it myself; however, I want to ask people who looked into Emacs rendering and text overlay capabilities if something of that sort is even possible. Or is it easier to rewrite Emacs GUI with something like Tauri? :)
 I am also happy to hear about other approaches or views on this problem which worked for you!

I use a non QWERTY keyboard layout (rsthd), and that makes using vim TERRIBLE, so like any normal person I changed my vim bindings to my layout. This caused a lot of issues regarding combos, and when I asked the vim community they said changing the default keymappings is a bad idea and I should just learn the default ones on my layout. I wanted to know how hard configuring Emacs is with a custom layout, maybe I should just switch sides.
 Tl;dr how does Emacs handle changing default keybindngs compared to vim?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question about splitting my configuration into multiple files, for vanilla Emacs, i.e., no Doom/Spacemacs/etc...
 I currently have my configuration by split theme which I then load using either (load "my-config.el") or (require 'my-config). This work well, but it crucially means that it is difficult to compile the configuration files (using the byte compiler or the automatic native compiler). This is because some of these config files have some dependencies on each other. In particular, all my config files assume that the load-path is set correctly and use-package and straight are installed and configured so that packages can be installed or used. When compiling files, especially using the asynchronous native compiler, these files are compiled in batch mode in a vanilla Emacs without any configurations. Hence any statements using unloaded packages would fail.
 What is the correct way to do this? I know I can put all my config in a single file (literate or otherwise) but I think this will get unwieldy quite quickly for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Right now I am developing a side project which is in production and has users(22350 lines of scala code). As I am the only developer I've decided to stick to the modular monolith approach. Is anyone has excepierence and can guide on how to achieve modularity? My current plan is to have such structure:
  
app/ => http api 
 bind everything together
 expose json rpc
 
 modules/foundation 
 expose persisting capabilities
 expose logging capabilities
 
 modules/coupon 
 can have depedency on other api
 can't have dependency on other non api modules
 implements interface in respective api
 can do persistence
 in general persist domain object defined in api
 unit tests
 integration tests
 can have dependency on foundation
 
 modules/coupon-api 
 no dependecies in general(can have depencies on other api or utility)
 expose interface
 expose domain object
 
 modules/foo
 modules/foo-api
 modules/bar
 modules/bar-api
  
The goal is to have strict boundaries between modules, exclude circular dependencies, define clear dependencies.
 How good is such structure from the local dev experience endpoint? (Are there any caveats with sbt+intellij that can make this unusable?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So visual-type line numbers are pretty much the only option I have currently if I want the numbering to respect folding of any kind (in code and org), but the issue that I currently face with visual line numbers is that they completely poop out with text wrapping (which makes sense considering that they are visual), is there any way to make it work?
 As an alternative, relative-style numbering respects text wrapping but fails with folds, so kinda makes this a weird place to be in XD. I've attached an example of a wrapped line where this fail can be seen in all it's glory.
 I would really appreciate any help with this, thanks!

 recently u/protesilaos published an excellent package called Denote which provides a simple interface to note taking. Coming from an ugly hyrolo file and dreading the hidden complexities of org-roam, I rejoice this development.
 Now, I have been wanting to implement a workflow that allows me to export my notes to other formats such as ODT and PDF, so that I can share what I write down with other, non-tech-savvy people (my notes contain my knowledge database). 
 However, I have some requirements for this: 
  
I want to produce a continuous file which contains parts or the entirety of my knowledge database. 
 I want each note to have a separate heading.
 I want each heading to feature the tags I associate with a particular note.
  
Now, I know that there is an org-export facili…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's just a passing/recurring thougt so unfortunately I don't have a good post to go with this (there's always the Haskell is better than $LANGUAGE post), but I think this should be one of the main ways people advocate for Haskell.
 The features you didn't know you needed (Airbags, ABS) are in Haskell today, and you could take them to production today for the low-but-not-that-low price of taking some time to learn Haskell. You'll be safer, go faster (in many cases), and your codebases will be rock-solid.
 Not every organization can afford the cost, but for those that can that's great. Even if you can't, you can bring some of Haskell to your organization -- while Haskell is greater than the sum of it's parts, you can replicate some of it's great parts.
 If not, by this point you can get by with languages like Rust which give you the 80/20, Typescript as well.

 Example:

 The only criteria is that these numbers are unique.

 So, are there packages in other programming languages that provide a "string with text properties" data structure? I'd be specifically interested in Python, which is what I end up having to use for work.

However, the update seems to have broken my Zenburn theme. I believe I had gotten this error and breakage before when I tried updating Zenburn manually. At the time I resorted to just keeping the older version and not dealing with the issue. Below is the messaging I received.

Whener I try to enter a character such as * (for a new headline), I receive the error message: funcall-interactively: Symbol’s value as variable is void: org-fold-core-style.

 Can I ask for some help on this problem? I feel like I am close but I cant figure out what I am doing wrong. I am trying to create a function which will give me the subset of combinations which have cardinality (x:xs) - 1. For example, for a list [4,5,6] would give [[4,5],[4,6],[5,6]]
 To find all combinations, I have the 
 AllCombinations :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [[a]] AllCombinations [] = [[]] AllCombinations (x:xs) = AllCombinations xs ++ map (x:)(AllCombinations xs) 
 which will output all subsets. My issue is filtering. Basically, if I apply a filter of Length x == length xs I seem to be filtering out items I dont want. 
 AllCombinations :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [[a]] AllCombinations [] = [[]] AllCombinations (x:xs) = filter(\x -> length x == length xs )( AllCombinations xs ++ map (x:)(AllCombinations xs) ) -- NB length X == length xs is due to the tail being the same length as the entire list - 1 -- 
 Which in prelude we will get
 ​
 Line > AllCombinations [4,5,6] [[4,5]] 
 Instead of [4,5],[5,6],[4,6]. Can any explain why [4,5] ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GHC profiler is today one of the most advanced
profiling tools for analyzing how Haskell programs use CPU time and
memory. It produces information on what parts of a
program could use optimizations to speed it up.
Unfortunately, the very definition of the GHC profiler makes it of
limited use when estimating time on two
classes of computations: firstly, those that need to do blocking IO;
and secondly, some computations that invoke functions written in other
programming languages.
In these cases, one could just turn to a tool like
ghc-events-analyze, however, it is not available
to plugins loaded in GHC 8, such as Liquid Haskell.
In this post I’m discussing a bit the limitations of the GHC
profiler, and I’m announcing timestats, a simple
profiling library that you might want to grab when…]]></summary>

 I am thinking of writing a new program. Said program is going to establish relationships between words on a database. Each entry on the database has multiple attributes.

 Is Haskell the correct tool for this project? Or is it too state-based for Haskell's functional ways?

It turns out that dictionary.com has an API that's free to use for personal, non-commercial use under 1,000 requests per day.
 These functions are built with completing-read so they play very nicely with ido, vertico, selectrum, consult etc. I haven't tried them with Helm or Ivy.
 Because they're interactive functions, it's trivial to add these as Embark actions. Specifically, I added them to the embark-identifier-map and embark-region-map.

 Also, I noticed that my org agenda files don't load up when emacsclient -c is used. They don't show up in the buffers.

 How to make Emacs to use no name or change my name to something else than my real name?

 Any idea how to do this?

It might have something to do with the size of the repository, I haven't checked. For example, when I invoke projectile-find-file in the nixpkgs repository (which is huge), nothing is shown, and I cannot even enter a filename to open it. In my own, smaller repositories, it's working fine. I'm using ido-mode, ido-everywhere and ido-ubiquitous-mode as well as ido-vertical-mode. Anyone else have this problem? It doesn't occur with projectile, just project.el. But I'd like to stick to emacs built-in stuff.

 I ponder binding my Meta key to the option key ⌥; it's currently bound to Cmd ⌘ so I have the ability to enter umlauts easily. (But given how little I need that in Emacs, since all my writing there is in English, I might as well switch and then have nicer key bindings.)

I'm setting them up from a devops angle, we use scala, I'm fairly familiar with jedis, but I don't write application code any longer.
 Random scenarios that can be deployed...
 - jedis is smart enough to do this first?
 - you query for the master each time.
 - your admin team uses a client re-config that you count on working
 - pub/sub?
 Appreciate it.
 Edit: The reason i asked [IfYouUse] was for some best/decent/crappy practices currently out there. Clearly there are options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 Making an unsigned bit shift function with a type signature of Integer -> Integer -> a
 So I am implementing a function for another function(helper function some may say).The type signature for the function I am working with is:
 ​
 expToVariableInteger :: SomeMonad m => Expression -> (Integer->Integer->a) -> Expression -> (a->Value) -> m Variable 
 The function I am trying to implement is a unsigned bit shift.
 Similar to Javascript's >>> Where -1 >>> 30 will result in 3 
 So I have function that will do such an operation if I run on GHCI 
 ushiftR r l = ( r :: Word) `quot` (2 ^ l) 
 I am aware of the Data.Bits function 
 shiftR :: a -> Int -> a
 Where I could do something like
 ushiftR :: Integer -> Integer -> a ushiftR r l = shiftR l (fromIntegral r) 
 But I have (so many) issues.
 The 3 I am focusing on is:
  
Writing a function that actually works with a signature (I have tried so many things, but I cannot get anything to run, example ushiftR :: Num a => Integer -> Integer -> aushiftR r l = ( integerToWord r) `quot` (2 ^ l)
 Then once I have that, how could I get the function to be a ushiftR ::Integer->Integer->a 
 My other option is recreating expToVariableInteger :: SomeMonad m => Expression -> (Integer->Integer->a) -> Expression -> (a->Value) -> m Variable
 to myExpToVariableInteger :: SomeMonad m => Expression -> (Integer->Integer->Integer) -> Expression -> (a->Value) -> m Variable
 Now thinking about this outloud that might be the best bet. Thank you for those that read this far.
  
Wow my first post! I am excited! Sorry for the crackhead formatting. Sorry if this is inappropriate haskell noob rubish.

 (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :hook (lsp-mode . efs/lsp-mode-setup) :init ;; TODO: Properly use the general leader. (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l") :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t)) (setq lsp-clangd-binary-path "/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clangd") (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'lsp) (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'lsp) 
 When I first open a cpp file, I start up in lsp-mode with the server connected. Then when I open another file in the same project, there is no lsp-mode. Running M-x lsp doesn't work, and running M-x lsp-mode causes lsp-mode to say it's disconnected. Moreover, running M-x lsp-describe-session shows the current file to be under the clangd instance in the tree alongside the other file that is indeed working.
 I was wondering if anyone has seen that before or has any tips on how to debug it. Thank you!

 My project is a simple cabal project with a an app/Main.hs file and app/Ffi.hs file. Ffi.hs includes the FFI code, which is used in Main.hs. Under app/raylib, I also have the raylib source files (in C). I can't find a working solution for this kind of setup; all the other stuff I found relied on the user having the C library installed on their machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some reason, (after recently upgrading packages), running org-agenda via C-c a and then selecting a view from the dispatch buffer (such as a Agenda for current week or day) just shows me a buffer with the last file in my org-agenda-files list - in this case, an org file called work-notebook.org. 
 Looking at the buffer list, I can find the *Org Agenda* buffer listed and so can switch with C-x C-b, but is there any way I can restore the usual behavior -- i.e. the *Org Agenda* buffer opens in a window in my current frame?
 I usually have org-agenda-window-setup set at current-window, changing it to reorganize-frame still gives me the same problem.
 I'm running Emacs 27.2 using Org mode version 9.4.4.
 EDIT : thanks to /u/yantar92 for suggesting https://github.com/Malabarba/elisp-bug-hunter for a tool, which allowed me to find out the issue is with a recent update to org-gcal. The problem and a temporary fix are described in this github issue.

 A TwoSum.hs file containing the following code (a simple two sum algorithm):
 {-# LANGUAGE TupleSections #-} import qualified Data.HashMap.Lazy as Map import qualified Data.Hashable as Hashable twoSum :: [Double] -> Double -> Maybe (Int, Int) twoSum list val = twoSumAlg list val 0 Map.empty twoSumAlg :: [Double] -> Double -> Int -> Map.HashMap Double Int -> Maybe (Int, Int) twoSumAlg [] _ _ _ = Nothing twoSumAlg (x : xs) val index map = if Map.member x map then result else twoSumAlg xs val (index + 1) newMap where foundIndex = Map.lookup x map result = (,index) <$> foundIndex newMap = Map.insert (val - x) index map 
 And a Main.hs file that calls this and prints the output.
 import TwoSum (twoSum) main = do print $ twoSum [4, 7, 2, 8] 12 
 This works perfectly and outputs Just (0, 3) when run with cabal run.
 The problem is that when I edit TwoSum.hs, VSCode doesn't give me any hints or Intellisense at all. If I move all the code into Main.hs, the Intellisense works fine.
 Is there a way to solve this issue?
 I'm pretty sure I've set up my project correctly, but here's my cabal file just in case
 cabal-version: 2.4 name: Project version: 0.1.0.0 executable Project main-is: Main.hs other-modules: TwoSum other-extensions: TupleSections build-depends: base ^>=4.14.3.0, unordered-containers ^>=0.2.19.1, hashable ^>=1.4.0.2 hs-source-dirs: app default-language: Haskell2010

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings and thank you all for being part of a knowledge-sharing community. I'm not sure exactly what I was doing a few weeks ago when  stumbled across a ZK article online. But I've been on a mission ever since to learn more and get my own implementation going. I have decided to use Obsidian, which is of course presents its own learning curve as well as the terrifying array of choices and customization options that come with it.
I am in my fifties and have been writing down notes on paper here, there, and and everywhere, for decades. But I never knew exactly what to do with all this material except for some occasional reviews, and when I found something of significant interest it might end up in a Word document, often along with other ideas that might have been somewhat related, and that would go into a subfolder somewhere, and soon it would be almost as hard to find as the original fleeting note was. I also have marginalia in almost every book I own, and I try to read a couple books a week, so there is a lot of that too.
Now that I see that the ZK method can rectify my poor organizational system, I am looking at my stacks of notebooks (and all those Word documents) and thinking.... wow, I should go through every last scrap and filter out the precious metals from the useless rocks, and get it all into my ZK. That will be a lot of time. Time that could be spent instead reading more books, which might provide a greater return on investment in terms of useful ideas and more polished knowledge that I can leverage.
I suppose the nominal approach is to set aside a certain amount of time every day to sift through the mound, knowing that eventually I can get it all accounted for.  It is at the heart of it an optimization question. But I am interested in reading about how others have dealt with the burden of getting a ton of unorganized and often useless notes into a new ZK.
Thanks for reading!]]></summary>

 I've been working with Scala for quite a while now and as someone who came from Java I liked Monix from the very beginning because of how much I worked with RxJava.
 So I'm just wondering how popular it is around here and what you like or don't like about it.

 ​
 Treemacs open the new file in the window where my PDF was. Every subsequent files open in the same wayt, i.e. takes up the window for my PDF. I would like it to use the main code window (window in the middle). Is there a way to do this? Thanks for any input.

 So, around 3 months ago I upgraded to emacs 29 and set up a "fresh" init.el; lots of copy/paste from my old config with an eye to using less "custom" features/keybindings and using "modern" tooling like embark and consult. I mostly develop in Elixir, so configured lsp with elixir-mode and found that xref-find-definitions triggered from the embark menu was working great and a real time saver.
 A couple of weeks ago, xref-find-definitions stopped working. I don't think I changed anything in my init.el, at least not related to lsp-mode or elixir-mode and definitely nothing related to xref. Now I always get No definitions found in the minibuffer whenever I call xref-find-definitions (either via C-. RET or M-.) even for items I know worked a few weeks ago. I've switched to using dump-jump in the meantime which is a great package but isn't as well integrated into embark.
 Can anyone point me in the right direction for diagnosing this issue?

 You can read the details in the readme, but even though it's still WIP, it already can:
 - autocomplete tags
 - insert links from selection
 - jump between notes
 - capture notes
 Give it a try please and let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll ask this question at a pretty high level, since it seems like an issue people might recognize, but if not, I can add more detail. I have (in the package monad-bayes), a type
 newtype Sampler a = Sampler (ReaderT GenIO IO a)
 which is used as a sampling monad. We wanted to generalize it to the following
 newtype Sampler g m a = Sampler (StatefulGen g m => ReaderT g m a)
 This version is parametrized by a choice of RNG and monad, which is great. Unfortunately, it's about 10x slower, at least when used as the sampling monad in a program that takes 1000000 random samples. 
 Does the typeclass constraint inside the newtype set off performance alarm bells for anyone? We tried inlining and specializing pragmas, but so far to no avail.
 Thanks!

 Is there a way to do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember seeing a while back (I believe in this subreddit) a thread on some starter projects for those learning… I know Python reasonably well and finally going to start to devote some time on learning Haskell and going through tutorials and books and getting grounded in some basics, but I find myself appreciating seeing things in action to really grasp the concepts. Any good repos or threads here would be much appreciated!

 I'm preparing for a backend developer Scala interview. Any tips what to pay attention to? I'm practicing recursion, stdlib, implementing immutable data structures: strings, lists, trees, graphs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I've recently moved from Cinnamon to i3wm and I am quite happy with this, except for Pycharm, that is quite terrible on the WM, so I am giving a try to emacs and I started with Doom. However, there is very little documentation on how to setup it in a way that it is comparable with Pycharm in usability, so I am wondering if you could point me in a direction on how to do that. Besides, there are some other problems that I am facing: - How do you setup and use python environments on emacs? I tried poetry, but it doesn't have anyway to inherit global site packages. There are many packages that I installed globally as I will always use them, so I don't want to keep reinstalling them in every environment. - I see nowhere a place to run and debug my python scripts and see the results. Also, after everything is setup will it be able to show graphs and images? - Treemacs always open in the .doom.d directory how can I make it open in my home directory?
 Thanks in advance.

I'd prefer to just keep these minimised by default like pdf attachments and expand them if I'm interested. Anyone know how?

 So I am kind of at a crossroads. I have used doom emacs for a few days and fell in love with emacs. So I decided to try to build the EMACS config from scratch. I also plan to learn elisp. The only worry I have is will there come a time where ELISP is not enough for EMACS and emacs stops being extended or used? 
 Edit: Maybe the question should be is there or will there be a limit imposed on the elisp languages' ability to improve EMACS?

My plans for this coming week:
Wrapping up my deep dive into The Tao of Travel by Paul Theroux. 3 weeks and counting.
I'm starting the book The Book of Form and Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki.
I'm working on the flow and rhythm of onboarding articles into my ZK. How the onboarding process flows is on a spectrum that is related to the complexity of the ideas captured from digesting the article. Some web articles are light containing only one or two sparkling ideas. Some books require weeks of additional research and reading to assimilate. Most artifacts of knowledge land between these two extremes. I'm working at the easier end of this spectrum.
Here are a few of the titles of zettel I've been working on last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I updated my brew packages yesterday, thereby inadvertently updating Emacs to version 28, which proved incompatible with my v26 configuration.
 Emacs started up in an unusable state, with multiple errors.
 This brought my workflow to a grinding halt. I should really have a backup Textmind instance for such situations. (Maybe I do somewhere.)
 I googled how to downgrade the package in brew, but that appeared needlessly complicated. Brew did not have alternative versions of Emacs.
 Instead I downloaded Emacs 26.3 from Emacs for Macos X. I installed it as Emacs 3 (and Emacs 27 as Emacs 2).
 I ran Emacs 3, and everything worked fine. Now I can upgrade my configuration at my leisure, and my workflow is uninterrupted.
 My googling didn't highlight this easy answer, causing me to waste time doing questionable things at the Terminal.
 I have a complicated setup with Chemacs profiles etc, and it somewhat surprised me when everything just worked. That's why I use MacOS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone built this? How tough would it be? Does anyone have ideas on where to start?
 To expand, I've noticed a recurring problem in big projects: someone makes a small, trivial change and then has to wait 30-45 minutes for all tests to run. This wastes time and compute. Over time, developers adjust the size of PRs to account for this. Instead of making small isolated changes, they batch a bunch of changes into a single PR so the tests all run together. At some point they break the repo up. Now they have to think about dependency chains, and they've copied a bunch of build boilerplate into many repos.
 I think a powerful solution would be to only re-run tests for code that changed. We can periodically re-run all tests on main/master, maybe once daily. We can add some configuration/annotation to specify that a particular test or test suite should always run.
 How would it work? At the very least, it would have to integrate with SCM to compare what's on main/master vs. on the current commit. But it seems naive to just compare which source files show up in the diff. Seems like it might have to do something at the bytecode level? Maybe some sort of instrumentation similar to what code coverage tools are doing. I haven't done much at that level.
 In any case, thanks for reading. I'm pretty keen to try to build something along these lines. Excited to read any ideas/links/tips you all might have.
 ​
 Update:
  
Thanks for the fun discussion! It sounds like some combination of testQuick and SBT's remote cache are worth a try. If I'll try to experiment with this and either post back here or write up a blog post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After some research, it seems that for writing a GRPC server in Haskell there are two options:
  
gRPC-haskell (which does not work)
 warp-grpc (using proto-lens like described here)
  
So for warp-grpc, I tried following the example but it panics:
 ``` $ git clone https://github.com/lucasdicioccio/warp-grpc-example . $ stack build ghc: panic! (the 'impossible' happened) (GHC version 8.4.3 for x86_64-unknown-linux): Prelude.chr: bad argument: 1526726659
 Please report this as a GHC bug: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/reportabug ```
 After updating resolver: lts-19.6, I get complaints about version constraints from packages.
  
For now, all I want is to do a GRPC server and not run an outdated example (without allow-newer set in the global stack.yaml):

 so suppose we have a list lst = [ (x1,y1) , (x2, y2) , (x3, y3), (x4, y4) ]. I know what my perimeter function does is basically:
 dist (x1,y1) (x2,y2) + perimeter [(x2, y2),(x3, y3),(x4,y4)] dist (x1,y1) (x2,y2) + dist (x2,y2) (x3,y3) + perimeter [(x3,y3),(x4,y4)] dist (x1,y1) (x2,y2) + dist (x2,y2) (x3,y3) + dist (x3,y3) (x4, y4) perimeter [(x4,y4)] 
 now in order to make the perimeter complete, ideally somehow if we're given the original list x:y:ys then perimeter(z:[]) = dist x z (in other words, head of original list + last of original list). So in our specific case, we'd end with:
  dist a b + dist b c + dist c d + dist d a 
 but I'm at a loss on how to get this to work. I'm sure it's something very simple. Any hints or suggestions would be much appreciate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I compile an el file, I sometimes don't see all the possible "undefined" warnings because they depend on the currently loaded packages in my emacs session. For example, if the file depends on the package org, some warnings would not show if org was loaded when I opened an org file before or if org is loaded by default in my init file.
 How do I make sure that compilation always happens in a "clean environment" where no packages are loaded? Running with emacs -Q would not work since custom packages can never be loaded, for example with eval-when-compile (unless I set up the load-path which is difficult since it is set by straight in my case).
 Also, would the compilation result be the same whether these required packages (like org in my example) are loaded or not? In other words, is it safe to ignore these warnings?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
When you find an article you grab some information from it and out it in your Zettelkasten, is it?
But what do you do with the original source?
I ask because I work a lot with articles and academic papers, so I fear I'd lose pieces of information that may be useful in the future (but not in the present, so they don't go into my Zettelkasten).
On the other hand I want to keep the workflow as simple and frictionless as possible.
I have DevonThink that is great, but I always encounter lot of friction when I store the files in it.
Any help and experience would be highly appreciated.
Thank you!]]></summary>

With other words, I would like to be able to type code that will go into functions one piece at a time, scattered in prose. Does anyone know if this is possible with org mode and how?
 If anyone is familiar with Knuth's literal programming system, one can add named statements to code blocks with "+=" syntax. As an illustration, here is a piece of code from Pharr & Humphrey Physically Based Rendering which is written in literal programming style (the one where I have seen this system in use, but there are probably others):
 <Function Definitions> ≡ void InitGlobals() { <Initialize Global Variables 2> } 
 Fragment "initialize global variables":
 <Initialize Global Variables> ≡ shoe_size = 13; 
 Add to the fragment:
 <Initialize Global Variables> +≡ dielectric = true; 
 Results with:
 void InitGlobals() { shoe_size = 13; dielectric = true; } 
 Edit: Ok, thank you all for pointing me to noweb. Didn't used it before and didn't know what it was, but it seems like exactly what I am asking for :).

emacs keys, not evil
 caps lock mapped to control
 left option as meta
 left command as super (not sure if I should change this to meta yet)
 right command mapped as F7
  
This looks somewhat sane and I can easily bind the menu key in other keyboards to F7 (or other F key) as well. 
 F7 is a prefix key and I’m using it as something similar to general.el as in “<f7>w” opens a prefix for my windows commands for example (like SPC w in doom or whatever).
 I wanted to map right command to hyper but that does not play nice with macos terminals.
 This is looking very nice to me, I honestly was not fully aware I could achieve this as I’m somewhat a beginner.
 I was using a lot of chords too but I reduced their usage due to some conflicts. They are still pretty awesome to have though (a quick “tt” opens vterm-toggle for example).
 Does this look sane to you guys? Is it too good to be true?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some reason, a few months ago the line spacing in Org Mode has increased. It's the line spacing between display lines, not merely between paragraphs or headings. The line spacing in my org-mode files has increased to 1.5 or 2 (just guessing).
 The variable "line-spacing" is nil. Actually setting it doesn't help.
 If I open a non-org-mode text file in emacs, the line spacing is fine.
 I discovered that the issue comes from org-indent-mode. But I also don't know why org-indent-mode would cause this. Does anyone have any ideas of what setting I can change?
 UPDATE: I was able to fix this by following the solution at the link provided below by JDRiverRun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My first language is not English and so my keyboard layout is not the US layout. In many international layouts, the right Alt is AltGr and does not work as a Meta key. I like this keyboard layout otherwise.
 Ideally, I would like to not have to move my hands away from the home row, but having only the left Alt available as Meta and reaching for AltGr (right Alt) from time to time breaks my flow.
 I tried switching CapsLock with AltGr and this would be the ideal layout. Using xmodmap, I think I was able to do it, but I could not understand what I did satisfactorily even after reading the doc. I don't like using tools that I cannot understand.
 Also something does not feel right about having a "non standard" keyboard layout. I don't want to make my life harder if I use another computer or OS. Do you have an opinion on that?
 What is your personal setup?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started using https://github.com/redguardtoo/vc-msg which is awesome. But often I would like to jump to the pr not just the commit. I found a way to do so by taking the data from git-commit-link and running it through a simple bash script
 #!/usr/bin/env bash git_url=$1 echo $git_url | sed 's/https:\/\/github.com/repos/' | sed 's/commit/commits/' | sed 's/$/\/pulls/' | xargs gh api | jq -r .[].html_url | xargs xdg-open 
 but I can't figure out how to write the elisp so i can call it from the ui.
 (eval-after-load 'vc-msg-git '(progn (push '("p" "[p]r open pr on github" (lambda () (let* ((info vc-msg-previous-commit-info)) (with-temp-buffer (insert (plist-get info :id)) (call-interactively 'git-link-commit))))) vc-msg-git-extra))) 
 i have that written i feel like i just need to wrap part of it in a (shell-command) but havent been able to get it working.

However, often enough to have made "undo" a part of my muscle memory after using those, it seems to be behaving like ace-jump-zap-to-char by cutting everything in between. I use the zap command, but I am not confusing it with the other two here.
 This has been going on for a while (at least through three iterations of my OS), but I am finally getting around to reporting it. Note that the ace-jump libraries haven't been changed for 8 years, so lib issues can't be a problem. Unless there is more recommended alternative https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use this library in my haskell program to generate a source map file, but getting some performance issue. The size of the mapping file generated was about 30M bytes, and it took almost 130 secs to get it. It's much more slower than I expected, though I can not figure out what's the problem causing it. Here's my code looks like:
 ​
 generateSrcMap :: String -> [FilePath] -> SourceRange -> Value generateSrcMap sFile srcs sourceRanges = generate $ SourceMapping { smFile = sFile, smSources = srcs, smSourceRoot = Nothing, smMappings = mappings } where mappings = mapMaybe getMapping $ zip sourceRanges [0 ..] getMapping :: (SourceRange, Int) -> Maybe Mapping getMapping (SourceRange start _ _, idx) = if srcFile == "std" then Nothing -- skip mapping stdlib code else Just $ Mapping { mapGenerated = Pos 1 $ fromInteger $ toInteger idx, -- business logic, use index as column mapOriginal = Just (Pos line column), mapSourceFile = Just srcFile, mapName = Nothing } where !srcFile = sourceName start !line = fromInteger $ toInteger (1 + unPos (sourceLine start)) !column = fromInteger $ toInteger $ unPos $ sourceColumn start 
 ​
 Also I tried using this rust library to run decode/encode the same source map json file. It turns out to be much fast than the Haskell code I wrote. It took ~14 secs for decoding and ~3 secs for encoding. So any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm migrating from Company to Corfu to try its integration with Orderless. I want to replace M-i, my "invoke company manually" key binding, with a trigger for Corfu.
 But I couldn't find a built-in function to invoke Corfu. It's usually triggered by TAB, but I prefer TAB to indent and never complete at the moment.
 I whipped up this hack by looking at how Corfu's UI is being triggered:
 (defun ct/corfu-trigger () (interactive) (corfu--auto-complete (corfu--auto-tick))) (global-set-key (kbd "M-i") #'ct/corfu-trigger) 
 It injects the auto tick so the internal equal check passes.
 I tried to bind to completion-at-point but even though that's what the TAB key (with the suggested configuration) is eventually calling, my bindings spawned the completions in the minibuffer instead of going through Corfu.
 What's a more elegant way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Emacs with Spacemacs right now on my Mac and it is mostly OK but there are certainly some issues when it comes to things like bad out-of-the-box macOS integration when it comes to things like file permissions, unimplemented tabs on macOS - although they work on Linux, some scrolling render refresh bugs, buggy window resizing, and the list goes, unfortunately, on... ;)
 Aquamacs apparently seems to have all this fixed and tailored for the Mac while giving you the option to customize things to perhaps even Spacemacs like experience - most of Spacemacs is really just packages setup to work nicely together.
 Also, Aquamacs people say that they even plan a separate Apple Silicon version (M1,M2) of Aquamacs (= better performance and longer battery) which is probably never gonna happen with the regular GNU Emacs. Or maybe I am wrong?
 BUT... maybe... there are some cons? And perhaps some are a dealbreaker preventing me to migrate from Emacs/Spacemacs to Aquamacs?
 For people who have used Aquamacs, what has been your experience? What are are pros and cons against a regular Emacs? Were there any dealbreakers?
 Also, how is it running Aquamacs and regular Emacs (with Spacemacs) on the same computer/user account? Will they play along nicely and don't mess things up, or they will be rewriting each others' configs all the time?
 UPDATE:
 I am using Evil mode, and also a leader SPC key so I basically don't use traditional Command bound Emacs keybindings.
 This seems to be a frequent "con" by people coming from vanilla Emacs when I try to find some cons of Aquamacs via Google - but in my case, that is not an issue.
 I am more worried about the compatibility of packages and code of Emacs Lisp scripts I will find on the Internet and whether it will run or not.
 Also, are there any weird hidden you-might-notice-them-only-after-a-few-months quirks that Aquamacs has when compared with vanilla Emacs?

 GNU Emacs is a wholly remarkable existence. It is not only ancient, but sharp: a wise master that has seen others fall and learned from their mistakes. It exists as a sort of second user land, integrating the underlying OS's built in libraries and utilities into a rich-text interface powered by thousands of lines of tried and true lisp code.
 Microsoft Windows is also a wholly remarkable existence. It, too, has quite the history; yet the Windows OS itself (and DOS before it) has largely served as a mcguffin in its own tale. Indeed, the rise of Microsoft and the personal computer seem to have taken place in spite of their OS's glaring deficiencies rather than because of any particular merit. And still, somehow, Windows 10 is ... Dare I say ... Kinda good? The move…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been possess this issue ever since I switched to emacs28 with native comp. If I try to open a file directly in the terminal version of emacs (e.g. emacs -nw filename), emacs won't open the file -- instead I get an error message saying: Symbol’s value as variable is void: \213, and a blank buffer. As far as I can tell, emacs works normally after that, and I can open the file with C-x C-f but it's a bit of an annoyance. The --debug-init option gives no additional output. This only happens with the -nw option. The gui works normally. Anybody know what's going on here? PS: I'm on MacOS and using the emacs-plus distribution from Homebrew. EDIT: After some investigation it turns out the following code inside my init.el file was the issue: (defvar startup/file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist) (setq file-name-handler-alist nil) (defun startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist () (setq file-name-handler-alist startup/file-name-handler-alist)) (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook 'startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist) Anybody know why this‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­would cause the error on emacs28?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: I maintain org-gcal, a package that lets users synchronize Google Calendar events with Org-mode files. One of the features that I have is a way to download the event description as HTML. Right now, I just download the raw HTML and place it in a drawer.
 I'd like to have the ability to wrap this HTML in some kind of block and preview it as Org-mode syntax, so that it's easier to read it in Emacs. I'm thinking of wrapping the text in a #+BEGIN_SRC html block (or maybe a custom block), calling out to Pandoc to convert the HTML to Org, and overlaying the Org-mode syntax to replace the HTML block (like org-display-inline-images, org-preview-html but with Org syntax instead of an image, graphviz-dot-mode, etc.
 I'd like a solution that preserves the original HTML, because org-gcal supports updating Google Calendar events based on the Org-mode file.
 Does anyone know of a library like this?

 If my case class is in the same file as my implicit conversions everything works fine. However I’d like to be able to reference case classes all over the place and use my implicit conversions but I keep getting errors related to implicits not being found. 
 To be a bit more concrete my implicits are in an object in the package 
 Root.sub1o
 When the case class is in the package Root.sub1a.sub2a.sub3a.sub4a.sub5a everything works fine!
 When the case class is in the package 
 Root.sub1a.sub2b.sub3b.sub4b.sub5b however I get errors about my implicits being out of scope. This seems kind of baffling to me but I’m sure I’m missing something obvious / fundamental

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Emacs and Doom for a while now and a couple of months ago my fancy icons (which I believe are provided by the all-the-icons package) have disappeared. I just see a bunch of boxes with "F0??" codes in them. 
 I tried re-running the all-the-icons-install-fonts command, and according to Emacs it runs successfully. I also see the following under $HOME/.local/share/fonts:
  all-the-icons.ttf et-book-display-italic-old-style-figures.ttf et-book-roman-old-style-figures.ttf file-icons.ttf material-design-icons.ttf weathericons.ttf et-book-bold-line-figures.ttf et-book-roman-line-figures.ttf et-book-semi-bold-old-style-figures.ttf fontawesome.ttf octicons.ttf 
 Also, Emacs no longer seems to be able to find any of the fonts under $HOME/.local/share/fonts. For example, ETBembo used to be my primary, non-coding font, but Emacs can no longer find that either.
 I've also run 'fc-cache -f -v` about 100 times :-)
 I tried some of the troubleshooting steps on https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el but those instructions seem to address issues with individual icons. I can't see any icons.

 sorry for the newbie quetion, I thought I got this but clearly I was wrong. So basically I want to modify a previous commit in my repo (by adding some modifications I already have in my workspace). Following a suggestion from Magit's author (here https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/22565/29817), Magit seems to have a command that should work pretty well for me: `magit-rebase-edit-commit`, bound by default to `r m`. Point is, when I do that, I see the buffer you see in the picture. If I need to add some lines to this commit, what should I do, since there's no "Unstaged files" section?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The `template-haskell` library has an enormous library of "lower-case" monadic helpers, things like this: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-2.18.0.0/docs/Language-Haskell-TH-Lib.html#v:appE 
 These are just the normal algebraic data types and functions lifted to work on monadic arguements. But... why? We don't do this for any other monad, and modern Haskellers are perfectly comfortable writing `AppE <$> x <*> y` rather than `appE x y`. And it's quite expensive - you have a huge module that duplicates every single function in this form, and it leads to downstream confusion as people use the two styles inconsistently.
 I think the reason for this existing may just be historical: this style was introduced in the TH paper in 2002, and applicatives weren't popularised until 2008. But they very much are popular now, so maybe we should deprecate it all and stop adding to it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 I am currently trying to do the following: only get headings that are the next actions to be taken. A concrete example: 
 * TODO Project ** TODO Task one, the next action that I want to see ** TODO Task two, but after the task one, not the next action 
 ​
 As you can see here, the next action is the task one.
 A slightly more complicated example: 
 * Project ** TODO Not next action *** TODO Next action *** TODO Not next action ** TODO Not next action * Another Project ** DONE Task one ** TODO Another next action 
 ​
 I managed to make a function with "org-agenda-skip-function" which allows me to find its famous next action. But how to do it with org-ql ? Is there a possibility to "translate" this function into an org-ql query ?I'm also thinking of creating a new predicate, "brother-up", which would return true if the heading has a heading of the same level before it
 So maybe I could find the next action by taking the following headings:
  
no task in done
 no descendant
 no "brother up" not done
  
I'm a bit lost, because I don't even know if it would work, and if I have thought about everything. I don't know exactly in which direction to go, because there is maybe an another better solution that I didn't think of.
 Thanks in advance for your answers :)

 I see the keycode f21 when I press it in Karabiner EventViewer as you can see here: https://i.imgur.com/ELylaKn.png
 I have tried f22 as well. Doesn't work.
 In Emacs I cannot make it run, e.g. this doesn't work:
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f21> t") (lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/Documents/test.txt"))) 
 But this does work:
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f15> t") (lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/Documents/test.txt"))) 
 Also, the f20 triggers C-p or something but that is some Menu key issue with macOS so I will just don't use that like that.
 But I would really like to use f21 - f24 or even higher as I am planning to purchasing X-keys programmable keypad and would like to use it with Emacs.
 Thanks for any advice how to make the function keys about 20 work in Emacs on macOS.
 UPDATE:
 I made this video where on the right you can see Karabiner EventViewer showing the key code f21 when Emacs shows nothing. At the end I included the log of pressed keys (C-h l) as well:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all ! 
 Recent emacs convert here, I'm using emacs with org-mode / org-roam for documentary filmmaking and freelance video work. Still working on a better workflow than what I have currently 
 I was wondering if someone has tried to integrate Emacs with their stream deck ? 
 Here is what I imagine it would be useful for : 
 - starting and stopping project timer with org-clock
 - global macros for pulling up a new notes or todo entry, or just general emacs macros
 - macro pad for more exotic commands that one might want to run every so often, or for switching buffers (with preview of the buffer name on the stream deck ?)
 ​
 All of these to me seem like feasible and useful. As I am relatively new to programming and elisp, I have a vague idea of how to implement this myself, but if someone has already gone through the trouble I would be happy to hear how they went about it !
 I use Doom emacs - macros and key bindings are pretty clear and easy to implement but more ways of interacting with emacs would be a plus for me ! 
 I imagine for the global commands something like the emacs api would need to be used, I've got to look into it more.

programmer the ability to express what a program is meant to compute

One aspect that was not easy to deal with was understanding verification

LH was trying to verify, but we wouldn’t be able to say exactly which facts LH
was using to check it or which facts were missing.
In this post I will present some recent contributions of mine to LH, which give
the user better access to the facts used during verification. We will go through
an example of how these facts can be used to help LH prove a property in a more

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my transients has recently changed behavior, and is very bothersome. Normally I would use it to choose a file from the project and then, with the transient menu staying open after visiting the file, I can press the another transient key and do that thing. But no more.
 Now, after visiting a file, it looks the same as before -- meaning, the transient stays open at the bottom of the screen -- but my cursor has now moved to the file itself and attempting to press one of the transient keys just inserts that character into the buffer, as if transient wasn't there. I then usually have to get rid of the inaccessible transient menu by calling another transient and cancelling it immediately, after which my screen has returned to full no-transient normal.
 Why would this one command be now causing my transient to lose focus without visibly exiting? The find-file or switch-to-buffer ones work just fine without any unexpected context changes: that is, the transient stays focused with them until I directly cancel it. 
 Code:
  (defun tsa/projectile (&optional choose-project) "Navigate the project files, possibly choosing project first" (interactive "P") (if choose-project (projectile-switch-project) (projectile-find-file))) ;; this is bound to <f2> (transient-define-prefix tsa/transient-window () "Window navigation transient" :transient-non-suffix 'transient--do-quit-one :transient-suffix 'transient--do-stay [["Switch" ("b" "buffer" switch-to-buffer) ("f" "find-file" find-file) ("g" "git-grep" consult-git-grep) ("p" "projectile" tsa/projectile) ;; THIS one is the issue ("F" "follow" follow-mode) ("a" "ace 1" transient-ace-cmd)] ])

 After several hours of trying to figure out why `n' no longer called ~org-next-visible-heading~ (which saw me re/uninstall several versions of both emacs and org), I discovered the problem, as described in the subject title. 
 Of course, I didn't even realize that I had updated my org-mode, the result of updating my emacs version!
 I saw this thread about the issues that arise from this change:
 Unintended consequences of removing org-speed-commands-user
 Are there any people who find the speed-keys as useful as me? 
 Is there a robust/idiomatic way to add your own commands, now that they are all lumped into ~org-speed-commands~? Some kind of use of ~append~ or ~add-to-list~ maybe?

I used to use Emacs such that I could see the clock on my OS, but now I want to try using Emacs entirely full-screen; problem is, I don't have a clock any more. I used to have it on the mode-line, but I didn't like how the time was replicated everywhere, and it was taking up space that I wanted for other things.
 Is there a way to put a clock, say, in the right side of the tab-bar? This is a little line of space that is almost never in use, so it'd be perfect.
 Update: Here's a hack that I don't recommend, but it was kinda fun to figure out: it uses a posframe and a timer to get it to display: https://paste.sr.ht/~ashton314/4d490af6b4c6ae2f00012c8d807383001b242f1e
 There are some better suggestions in the comments, which I'll probably be using. :)
 2nd Update: Thanks to u/karthink, I've found a solution that works perfectly:
 lisp (add-to-list 'tab-bar-format 'tab-bar-format-align-right 'append) (add-to-list 'tab-bar-format 'tab-bar-format-global 'append) (setq display-time-format "%a %e %b %T") (setq display-time-interval 1) (display-time-mode)

 I've installed ghc 9.2.3 via ghcup. But it didn't work by default. I was getting linking errors when building any software: ~~~ $ ghc Main.hs ... ld64.ldd: error: unknown argument '--gc-sections' clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 ~~~
 I had to set: ~~~ ("ld is GNU ld", "NO") ~~~ In my settings file to fix this.
 Is this a bug in my initial set-up or ghc's bindist? I'm assuming it should work without having to tweak any default settings, and the ghc webpage claims that all I should need is the xcode command line tools installed.
 Next, I'm wanting to use the default ng code generator, rather than the llvm, so I'm slightly concerned that it is invoking clang.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I'm not a web-developer, but I occasionally use emacs for writing HTML. I've been far from memorizing the tags and attributes in HTML - with programming languages, I don't memorize the parameter list :/. So, I usually have an idea of what I want to do in HTML, but need to resort to googling/duckduckgo-ing quite frequently.
 However, I felt, it would be pretty great if there were some mode / emacs-extension / some-eww-friendly-website that could provide the tags, and the attributes that each tag takes, may be along with small examples as well as "see also". I've tried company-web and lsp-mode, and both provide descriptions of tags (which I mostly don't need!) but don't provide the attributes. With other languages, it is a great help to see the parameter list in the echo area, or even the function/macro/keyword documentation with a simple command.
 So, if anyone knows about this, it'd be great!
 Thanks you!
 EDIT: Moments after I posted this, yasnippet struck me; and it is helpful, but the tag-attribute reference manual would still be appreciated!

 I have a problem using tramp with my ssh config file and ProxyJump . I just can't figure out why it does not work. The situation is the folowoing:
 Machine_A ---> JumpMachine ---> Machine_B
 My ssh config for that looks as follows:
 Host Machine_B Hostname <some_ip> User <my_username> Port <some_port> ProxyJump JumpMachine ServerAliveInterval 60 Host JumpMachine Hostname <some_ip> User <Some_user> Port <some_port> ProxyCommand <a_simple_bashscript> IdentityFile <my_identiyfile> Host Machine_B_admin Hostname <some_ip> User <my_admin_username> Port <some_port> ProxyJump JumpMachine ServerAliveInterval 60 
 Machine B has no PW auth, only the jumpmachine. Both can be obviously accesed using ssh. The setup works with my shell (fish) as well as other shells and with vscode.
 ​
 What is really strange, is that that tramp always asks me for ssh:Machine_B passsword: while only the JumpMachine has a password. The PW auth is turned off for ssh on Machine_B. I tried using the password for JumpMachine and Machine_B and neither works. TBH I am not really sure what to do by now.
 I just wanted to mention that there is also another entry for my admin account. Don't know if that matters in any way.
 Any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to disable the splash screen by default when opening Emacs. Everything I tried from the many help threads for this very problem failed, so I tried C-h v inhibit-startup-screen to see if these variables were indeed being set correctly. In fact, the value of inhibit-startup-screen was nil, and it is being set by startup.el.
 How can I have startup.el not overwrite my Emacs configuration file?
 EDIT: Found the solution. There were some errors in loading the Emacs config file, however the splash/startup screen hid those errors, so I never knew there were any problems. When the config file couldn't finish loading, it didn't get to my (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) instruction, hence it used the default startup.el setting. Resolving those errors meant that the config file would load entirely, and indeed the startup screen would be inhibited.

 There is things like keyboard maestro for mac or autohotkey that let you create macros and assign them to keys in certain programs. Autohotkey uses an alien syntax and keyboard maestro is mostly mouse based. They are ok but I always wondered if using elisp and emacs would be a more powerful combination. Besides, it would ran on all platforms. Would emacs server be able to do something like this? Anyone ever tried to do something like this?
 I have never tried EXWM but looking at performance I dont think it would work for me since this is for heavy post production tools.
 Update: thanks for the Linux suggestions but I am looking for a solution that runs on Mac and Windows mostly since all post production tools widely used run on those.

...is that lists are basically as much a control structure as a data structure in Haskell. And this makes sense: where you would use a C-style for loop in a different language, you would use a [1..] list in Haskell.
  
What does this mean? 
 I was searching for IOVector/MVector because I want to create a virtual machine; now for my purposes are Lists/Sequences the data structure I'm looking for, specially if I'd like to stick to a more functional paradigm.

The org-file in question is a bit long (~2k lines). When the app freezes, if I run pkill -USR2 Emacs from an external shell, I get to see the following debug trace:

 I'm using the latest Doom Emacs, with Emacs-Mac 28.1 (https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport) on an M1 Mac Air. Any tips/suggestions on how to debug this? Thanks in advance!

 I'm not an Emacs user, but a couple of years ago, I discovered the magic of Vim. Then I discovered the magic of keyboard remapping. Soon after, I was blissfully navigating text in every program with just capslock and my trusty hjkl;0 keys.

 I use a file as my main "dashboard" and I would like to insert an agenda view into it. The idea is to "refresh" this buffer, remove the currently displayed agenda, compute the agenda for the day, and insert it into this buffer.
 I can do lisp, but I wonder if there is something similar to what I am trying to do that might have been already implemented.
 I guess ultimately I can look at the source code of org-agenda and reuse its code, but I am wondering if I would be "rediscovering the wheel"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I have a need for functionality I haven't been able to find, though I might just lack the proper terminology to find the solution. I am a emacs noob, using Doom Emacs mostly for JS/TS programming (the killer features I am in love in with are magit and the ease of being keyboard-only). 
 So, my problem: I am currently working on the largest project I had ever done, and I would like to have some sort of automated system that would crawl through my code, find all the comments with tags (such as TODO, NOTE...), and compile them into an org file (for example notes.org) at the root of my project. 
 It seems like a fairly simple problem, and I am almost certain there already is a solution, but I haven't really been able to find it. The reason I haven't written it yet is because while elisp is cool and I'd like to be able to understand it, I haven't had the time yet (and after I am done with work, I barely have the brain power to read a book, not to learn a wholly different language). 
 Any pointers would be most appreciated! Thanks

Overall I've seen the value of optics but there is one place where I haven't been able to figure out how to apply them. That place is trying to set a value for which I have a prism, especially for which I have a lens + prism that I want to use to reach deep into a value.
 Setting on a prism only replaces the value if the prism matches. I'd like to know if there is some optics construction that I can use to replace the value whether or not the prism matches. I know about review but that doesn't compose with lenses. I can ignore the prism and just use set on the lens with the value wrapped in the correct constructor, but I'm looking to see …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking at the [Data.Functor](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.2.0/docs/Data-Functor.html) documentation page on Hackage, the opening paragraph says 
  
A type f is a Functor if it provides a function fmap which, given any types a and b, lets you apply any function of type (a -> b) to turn an f a into an f b, preserving the structure of f. 
  
In this scenario is it valid to call f a type? And even if it is, considering its kind is * -> *, wouldn't it be more accurate (and even less confusing) to say it's a "type former" or type constructor? To my intuition it feels a little odd to say something is a type when its kind is not * so it isn't really a concrete type.

 This is the config I am using

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm making the switch from Neovim to Emacs for Clojure development.
 For the completion I'm used to <Tab> and <S-Tab> for cycling through suggestions, and the suggestions would be automatically placed in the buffer when selected so that <Enter> would only behave as a newline.
 This is what I got for now:
 elisp (use-package company :init (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode) :config (global-company-mode t) (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1) (setq company-idle-delay 0.0) :bind (:map company-active-map ("TAB" . company-select-next) ("<backtab>" . company-select-previous) ("RET" . nil))) 
 Issues:
  
Now I don't have a way to autocomplete since when I select suggestions they don't get placed in the buffer
 Placing S-TAB instead of <backtab> in the :bind section doesn't work
 If I tap <S-Tab>, then pressing <Enter> becomes unresponsive
  
Thanks! Any help is appreciated. :D (Also if you see some bad practice tell me please)
 EDIT: did I do something wrong? I see a 50% of downvoting rate

 I guess this can be seen as a general case of right-aligning the completing-read display.

But then if I try to type the username and IP of the remote machine, every single character I type causes Tramp to ask me for the local machine password again. I have to hit ESC to show the original Tramp prompt again. Typing another character asks for the password again. You get the idea.
 Has anyone else had this? I don't even know where to look to know what to fix.

Since lists are fundamental to Haskell, I was wondering if Haskell represents lists as actual linked lists in memory. If it does, then how much does Haskell suffer performance wise because of this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've released version 0.2 of plz.el, my HTTP library for Emacs Lisp that uses curl as a backend. This version includes a new feature, a simple request queue system. It works like this:
 (defvar my-queue (make-plz-queue :limit 2)) (plz-run (plz-queue my-queue 'get "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=0" :then (lambda (body) (message "%s" body)))) 
 Or:
 (let ((queue (make-plz-queue :limit 2)) (urls '("https://httpbin.org/get?foo=0" "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=1"))) (plz-run (dolist (url urls queue) (plz-queue queue 'get url :then (lambda (body) (message "%s" body)))))) 
 So far it's only been used in the newest version of Ement.el, my Matrix client for Emacs, to queue requests for images (like room avatars, image messages, etc). It seems to be working well, but please let me know if there are any issues.

 Sometimes when I shutdown emacs and fire it up again I get some errors like this and my perspectives ares gone:
 Error: Can not autoresume perspectives -- (error Buffer is not associated with any file xxxxxxx )
 As the error says, the problem is that for some pre-existing buffer in the saved perspective there is not anymore a file to the buffer to load from.
 This seems like it should have a simple fix, IF THE FILE IS GONE, KILL THE BUFFER! But I did not find how to configure persp-mode to behave like that. Does any one knows how to do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya everyone, I've been using Org mode for a while and have also tried the likes of Notion, Confluence/Jira and a plethora of other tools as a knowledge base/project management options within different teams.
 Is there a way to use Org without forcing an entire team to learn Emacs and a sync workflow? The Org+git workflow is understandably a big ask and I've experienced the pain a few times already. I'd like to use Org in Emacs on my own machines but have other team members access the data through a lower entry-barier interface such as the web.
 Tools like LogSeq seems to want to head there but still have a large focus on having to obtain their client first. Many teams are familiar with the "login through SSO and make changes" kind of workflow, so I'm keen to learn what's in this space and how you all solve this problem -- in case this is even a problem for y'all. Is this even a reasonable ask or shall I just stuck it up and suffer through Notion and Confluence/Jira?
 PS: I'm often fill of rage when I use those tools but as I find them inhibiting (breaking my flow) but maybe I just need a (better) therapist. 🤷🏿‍♂️

 I have this:

 I wanted to insert a question into my daily journaling practice (aka a "journaling prompt"). Maybe someone will find this useful:
 A touch of capture templates:
 ("dj" "Journal" entry (file+olp+datetree ,(concat org-directory "/personal-daily-2022.org")) "* Entered on %U Prompt: %(dm/get-journaling-prompt) %?") 
 And a bit of elisp:
 (defun dm/get-journaling-prompt () "Returns a single line from journaling prompts." (save-window-excursion (find-file (concat org-roam-directory "journaling_prompts.org")) (goto-char (point-max)) (let* ((number-of-prompts (- (line-number-at-pos) 10))) (goto-line (+ 10 (random number-of-prompts))) 
 This is what it ends up looking like after invoking the correct capture template: https://dmitrym0.github.io/ox-hugo/2022-07-17_13-10-28_screenshot.png
 and a quick blog post about it: https://dmitrym0.github.io/posts/journaling-prompts-with-emacs/

My plans for this coming week include continuing my deep dive into The Tao of Travel by Paul Theroux. Theroux's book is an interesting turn on the philosophy of travel. I'm connecting ideas about the philosophy of travel with relativity and space/time.
I'm starting the book The Book of Form and Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki. I don't know what to expect at this point. The many layers of story in her first book moved me a lot: A Tale for the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki. I just ordered The Book of Form and Emptiness via InterLibrarary Loan, and it took four months to get it (the anticipation built up my expectations!). It came across the country from the Yuma Public Library. Thanks, University of Idaho Library, for hunting it down and the community of Yuma for lending it!
Here are a few of the titles of zettel I've been working on last week. The top two in the list are still in my "#proofing" oven.

 my goal is to build a Haskell package (library). The ultimate goal of this process is to have this package installed locally and to be able to use these functions.
 After cabal init, cabal configure and cabal build, This is the output after cabal install:

 I am not able to use the package, though. 
 When entering

 Which step am I missing or doing wrong?

Instead of passing along the original structure you pass down add helper data structure instead. For my specific use case i am looking to typecheck an AST, when in a declaration node i would like to add to the helper data structure, essentially building the data structure when going from the root to the leaves. Then going from the leaves to the root i can use the helper structure when identfiers are used.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago my personal note taking was no longer based on trial and error but on a solid concept called Bullet Journaling. It started on paper with a lovely Moleskin book and a black fine liner from Neuland. Going digital with my Bullet Journal I decided to use a brilliant tool for note taking named OneNote. But time went by. In March 2022 I got my first contact with Obsidian and at the same time with the Zettelkasten method from Niklas Luhmann explained in the brilliant book from Sönke Ahrens about “How to take Smart Notes”.
Migration from OneNote to Obsidian was a migration from structured notes to networked notes. But how to migrate a Bullet Journal to a Zettelkasten? Difficult to switch from one concept to another? No, it’s very easy. The Bullet Journal is now a set of Structure Notes in my Zettelkasten. Also Zettelkasten is a Custom Collection in my Bullet Journal.
In other words:
my Zettelkasten is a Bullet Journal and
my Bullet Journal is a Zettelkasten.
The best of all: I did not need to change the basic concepts from Ryder Carroll (Bullet Journal), neither the concepts from Niklas Luhmann (Zettelkasten). Both concepts support each other in a perfect manner.
What about your experiences with theses methods? Do you use the Dataview plugin to support your Bullet Journal collections?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With your help, I'd like to to understand how exporting completion candidates works with consult and embark.
 Here's a use-case that comes up a lot in my flow as a programmer: find & replace text matches.
 You might say projectile-replace works great but it prompts for every replace and is super annoying, especially on very large code-bases.
 So how to do it with consult and embark?
 I think I have come close with the following flow:
 - M-x consult-git-grep
 - #match-this-text
 Now, if I M-x embark-collect, I end up with an embark buffer. If, on the other hand, I M-x embark-export, I end up with a grep buffer. 
 Which of the two buffers do I need (why?), and how do I go about replacing the text I'm after?

I know Doomemacs offers a more Vim-like experience but I worried about getting lost without knowing more basics. So I was wondering whether it's a good path to basically just consider Doomemacs its own experience and start from there, as it were the basic editor?

 I jumped in the Org / DooM bandwagon in 2020. On my phone and tablet (termux / orgzly), and laptop (*nix)
 Org works for me because it's keyboard based, and on all my devices.
 Unfortunately I've struggled to leave noob level, and failed to make org mode into the "second brain" / virtual assistant I envisaged. I shouldn't complain as it's genuinely useful for GTD-like organisation and location based reminders (via tasker)
 I see the weekly tip thread in on r/emacs, but most of the tips are way more advanced than the level I'm at.
 Had anyone got any noob friendly tips about general org-mode capabilities to explore?
 My current workflow / level is:
  
Open org file from bookmark (dired)
 Edit and save org file
 use links, including to files, to organise stuff
 if there are conflicts (damn you syncthing), resolve with ediff
 if anything goes "weird" in emacs kill buffer / delete window until back to the fallback buffer - then try again.
  
I had some luck early on with tasker and bash scripts to manipulate org files based on various conditions - but I've long forgotten how all that works.
 Similarly, I tried to get notmuch mail setup two years ago, but ran into trouble with gmail and exchange authentication 
 Would love to hear your suggestions for my org-mode journey.
 I've also asked if there are any emacs-specific things I can try on the emacs sub

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing with plantuml src in org files to generate drawings. It works great except for one thing, the indentation gets lost when I add nested objects.
 Where should I look to extend the existing indentation code to handle nested cases?
 Minor modes enabled in this buffer: Display-Line-Numbers Font-Lock Org-Src Visual-Line The major mode is plantuml mode defined in plantuml-mode.el: 
 Should I be looking at the plantuml major mode first, or the Org-src minor mode to noodle with the indents?
 Any recommendations on how to approach indentation config?
 Example showing how the indents get lost:
 * Components Drawing #+begin_src plantuml :file ComponentDiagram.svg @startuml Component Diagram ' Components component ExternaComponent1 package "Subsystem" { component SubSysComp1 [ Subsystem Component 1 ] package "InternalNestedSubsystem" { package "InternalDoubleNestedSubsystem" { component SubSubComp1 [ Sub-Subsystem Component 1 ] component SubSubComp2 [ Sub-Subsystem Component 2 ] SubSubComp1 -() internalInterface1 internalInterface1 )- SubSubComp2 } ' This lines up correctly } ' This should be one indent to the left } ' This should be all the way to the left @enduml ' This should be all the way to the left instead of indented. #+end_src

 This is yet another sequel to my Clean Architecture with Haskell and Polysemy article.
 In my last blog post I demonstrated how the actual hosting of a WAI web app (e.g. with the Warp server or on AWS Lambda) can be defined as a Polysemy effect. The idea was well received in the haskell subreddit and stirred some further discussions. One question that came up: why did I explicitly load configuration before starting the Polysemy effect interpreter? Wouldn’t it be much more in line with the overall idea of my Polysemy Clean Architecture to handle this loading also as an effect?
 I explained my reasons for this design but promised to look for a better solution.
 In this blog post I’ll explain the new design that I came up with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy. I'm completely new to Emacs. Just loaded it up for the first time on Ubuntu Studio 22.04 and the UI is way to small to see anything (see this screenshot).
 I looked for solutions and everyone says to Ctrl + Scroll Wheel, and that doesn't do it. It only zooms the editor. The UI / Window stuff itself says small.
 I tried installing the Spacemacs config to see if it would fix it, but it didn't.
 Any ideas on how to fix this?
 edit: The award goes to u/Faerryn for fixing it. Thanks to everyone else for the suggestions, but thankfully I don't have to try them. I've added the solution here for easy finding:
  
Open ~/.emacs.d/init.el
 Add (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "FONT HERE" :height 120) to the file.
 Replace "FONT HERE" with your desired font.
 Save the file.

 I've gone through most of the tickets that reported similar errors, and the suggestion is to disable TemplateHaskell using the pragma {-# LANGUAGE NoTemplateHaskell #-}. However, that doesn't help in this case. I've opened a ticket myself, but open-source maintainers usually have other things to do, so, I'm not holding my breath.

 Stackage and stack are the most widely used tools we have. Many developers use the process for early discovery of library activity: who is behind the (sometimes punishing) pace of change; when will it be easiest to upgrade; which dependencies can I trust.
 With the PvP-style philosophy you have less visibility.
