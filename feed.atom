        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Want to let the community know that Tesla is hiring Haskell software developers for internship and full time positions. Haskell has been used in production for years and we're actively growing the team. If you're interested in applying please use one of the following links:
 Full Time: https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/software-engineer-data-tools-82891
 Spring Internships: https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/software-engineering-internship-spring-2022-98585
 Summer Internships: https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/software-engineering-internship-summer-2022-105729
 Also, please send us an email at "vehiclesoftwarerecruiting at tesla" and let us know you saw this post.
 A few frequently asked questions:
  
US work authorization required
 The full time position is in Palo Alto, CA, not remote
 Internships can be remote, but preferred to be on-site (it's more fun, anyway!)
 We're looking for candidates with 1-3 years experience developing Haskell (or an equivalent functional programming language) in a production environment. This is a flexible requirement but that is the ideal candidate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the common complaints with the Haskell ecosystem is the existence of libraries with little expository documentation. Sometimes these libraries are quite useful and, in fact, are part of the mind space of the more seasoned members of the community. Yet, for a newcomer such libraries can seem impenetrable. Yet is all hope lost? The code is there after all. That’s the documentation, right!?
 What are your strategies for familiarizing yourself (to the point of pragmatic proficiency) with a sparsely documented library? 
 Do you have any stories or tales of a time when you achieved something “great” in such a case?

I consider myself a relatively intermediate Haskeller, insofar as I understand and regularly use the more advanced parts of GHC. Though I rarely use it in production (as almost all my programming is for personal projects of interest), I find myself extremely productive in Haskell, and can generally get GHC to do what I want.
 Except when what I want is good performance. It’s not that I don’t know about laziness: I know what it is and (roughly) how it works, and I take advantage of it often enough. It’s not that I’m unaware of space leaks: if the profiler shows a great big triangle shape, or my program slows down as it runs, those are usually pretty good signs that I have one.

 It's been a daily lesson on humility. For most other languages, one week of studies at the end of a work day plus the whole weekend would be enough to have a firm grasp of its fundamentals and make decent stuff. But with Haskell it's been three weeks from monday to monady and it is kicking me hard on the butt, nuts, teeth and anyplace else that hurts. I think this is more related to the way I think as an imperative programmer (more than OO or even immutability) than being a difficult language. Maybe it is a difficult language. I don't kow.
 I really liked the language. I like its simplicity and expressivity while not losing rigor with types. …]]></summary>

 What is the best way to maintain my tools/toolchain so that I can easily switch between the projects without too much hassle?
 Specifically, the things I find tricky is:

 This answer seems to suggest there is no way to do this.
 I tried making sense of this but could not.
 Finally, I tried to wrap the function in async-start but even that did not work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using Scala and following it for years. Scala is declining in usage because Java is becoming better and Kotlin is getting pushed hard and is a smaller step for many Java developers. Personally I really love the Scala language over all the other languages I have tried. I have been following on Twitter and on Reddit and the only thing I feel is that I want to stay as far away from that mess as possible. I sugest the leaders in the comunity to travel somewhere and get a professional mediator and resolve all issues. You don't have to be friends after that but at least stop making Scala look more like daytime soap opera than an excellent comunity with smart people. You all want this to succeed. Perhaps it is more complicated and I'm being naive but from a bystanders perspective it looks pretty bad.
 The reason why I went to all the Scala conferences was because of all the smart people and the technology. Please bring back that focus and become that comunity again.
 As said before I don't have the details. I'm just describing how it looks from my perspective and others might feel different or that it's to complex to resolve these issues.

I keep this in the same document I maintain my work log. Recently I extracted this functionality into a package to clock in/out, and reports a summary of the last time: as well as accumulating all available times (which I use to show the time worked in a week). Link to the utimeclock repo. Locally I have the mode-line display the accumulated time for the day & week which I quite like. Although this would need some more work to split out from my init file (see this question) since it's piggy backing on which-function. ---- Before creating the package I checked on other time tracking utilities, as far as I can tell they're more verbose, and don't fit so easily into editing a text document which happens to contain a time log. Feedback welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did a little searching on the forum and didn't find a whole lot about this idea. (the main thing I found was someone's setup for creating journal entries) A lot of new note-taking applications (e.g.: Roam, Craft) have the idea of creating a dedicated note for specific days of the year when you access the application. This allows for easy access to journaling, creating stuff that you'll see on specific days, idea entry that you can sort later, etc. which I personally find to be quite nice. I don't necessarily always have some specific title in mind for something I want to write about, or even links to other things.
This seems to be a bit at odds with how The Archive wants to nudge you into adding to your Zettelkasten. And just basically somewhat opposed to the idea of creating atomic notes that are heavily interlinked, since it's more of a scattered "note" that might just have thoughts about stuff on a specific day. But I also wouldn't want to give up the ability to link to things in my Zettelkasten (and have stuff in separate locations, because goodness knows I've used a lot of applications and have notes scattered everywhere), or searchability across everything, because I want to write stuff related to specific days. (I have made at least one note in the style of the linked post, using just YYYYmmdd, which maybe just solves the issue but I haven't done much with that idea yet so I'm not sure how it might work out long term)
Does anybody have experience working with "Daily Notes" in The Archive/Zettelkastens in general? Is there something specific you do to make it work well? Is this discouraged? etc.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent 2 days scouring the internet for answers on how to make company work with proper code completion, however I can't seem to find a solution that just works on my emacs installation. I only chose company because it seemed to be the most efficient and best choice, however I am doubting that now.
 I'm asking for help here as a last resort to find solutions or personal fixes of all kinds to get simple code completion (including variable names) inside emacs using whatever module is best. What I have in mind is VSCode-like code completion with the drop down menu we can go through, however if there's an alternate kind thats fine as well. Whatever help you have, keep in mind I'm a relative emacs newbie, so if it could be explained simply / explicit config lines that would be most helpful.
 Thanks in advance.

 The only Meta key that behaves as expected is the left hand side of the space bar. I need both to behave as modifiers otherwise emacs is very difficult for me to use.
 ​
 I have started with emacs-gtk -q --no-init-file to ensure it isn't something I have enabled. The only way it works is to run emacs in the virtual console with no X.
 Even emacs in X terminals (gnome, xfce, Mate etc.) still have the right Meta disabled.
 Does anyone have an fix? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data.Vector.Unboxed essentially gives a Structure of Arrays representation - Vector (a,b) can be stored as (Vector a, Vector b). 
 This has some minor issues - deriving doesn't really work, writing the typeclass by hand is really annoying, GHC cannot optimize away dead reads if you only use one field - but overall it's a reasonably nice and composable abstraction.
 I'm currently playing with some code which accepts messages and must store them efficiently before they get batch-executed. To make this extensible I'd like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.
 But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn't matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.
 This lead me to a number of questions:
  
Is there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?
 Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational
 Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -> Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values
 Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like
  
 
type ExtractPII<Type> = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; 
 If people have ideas to any of these points I'd really like to hear about them!

 I've tried to write some functions but I cant find how to get prompted in order to paste the youtube url. 
 I've tried with a defalias function
 (defalias 'you (lambda() (interactive)(shell-command "/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads"))) 
 And also with a defun function
 (defun youtube-download () "download youtube video" (interactive) (shell-command "/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads"))` 
 Both works but I do not get prompted to paste the youtube url. What am I missing in order to get prompted so I could paste the youtube url?
 Thanks in advance.
 New Edit: Working now. Thanks to @RadicalDownist / @ieure
 (defun youtube-download (Y-URL) "Download Youtube Video" (interactive "sPaste YouTube URL: ") (shell-command (format "%s %s" "/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads" Y-URL))) 
 If you do not want any shell output buffer. Replace shell-command line with:
 (call-process-shell-command (format "%s %s" "/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads" Y-URL nil 0)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Very recently I switched to native compilation branch of emacs (aka gccemacs). It works nice so far.
 Now a few questions arrived.
  
How to clean up eln-cache? I have multiple files of the same package, all the same size. Probably the older file is obsolete, can I identify obsolete files by its date? Is there already some available mechanism to use for deleting obsolete *.eln files?
 Example:
 -rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 628720 13. Nov 01:06 yasnippet-026a6aeb-f8d0d467.eln
 -rwxrwxr-x 1 user user 628720 12. Nov 20:11 yasnippet-4376b1db-f8d0d467.eln
 
Emacs is distributed with lot of lisp files, all those compiled *.eln files are kept at ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/*/. The result is, every user on the system needs to compile those lisp files and every user allocates HDD|SSD memory for those lisp files. Is it possible to keep those *.eln files at a central location on the HDD|SSD (e.g with the emacs installation)? How to do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /r/emacs,
 recently I've been working a lot with tables (with text rather than numbers), and for the first time in years I came to the conclusion that Emacs is not the best tool for a task (especially one it could in principle be good at), and thus for now I'm doing my tables in Google Docs. 
 table.el is in principle suitable, but 
  
it is not snappy,
 having multiple lines per cell requires empty lines between them, otherwise they will be collapsed into a single line (since I need multiple lines per cell I can't use the org-mode table editor)
 it has its own separate mode which doesn't work well with org-mode (particularly I'm missing lists and org-ref links)
 it is easy to mess up the table structure by accidentally typing on the lines,
 it cannot temporarily hide rows or columns (a Google Sheets feature I didn't expect to be so handy) and
 both navigating around and repositioning columns and rows is rather tedious.
  
Of course it is still a great piece of software, but I think it can be improved. I'll start to tinker with it soon-ish, but my elisp knowledge isn't the greatest, so I thought I'd ask here if anybody has ideas where to start. In particular, I have the hunch that child frames can be used to address the lack of snappiness, the empty lines issue and the lack of org-mode integration, but I haven't used them much myself, so perhaps someone with more experience has thoughts about their appropriateness. Also if there are other ideas how to improve editing text tables I'd love to hear them.
 Cheers!

 I really don't see anything wrong:
 priceRange :: Price -> Price -> [Cupcake] -> [Cupcake]
 priceRange minprice maxprice [] = []
 priceRange minprice maxprice [CC p i] = [CC p i | pricelower minprice p, pricelower p maxprice]

 In an equation for ‘priceRange’:
 Patterns not matched:
 (P _) (P _) ((CC (P _) []):_:_)
 (P _) (P _) ((CC (P _) (_:_)):_:_)

 25 | priceRange minprice maxprice [] = [] 
 For this it says I didn't match the two cases in which the list inside is empty or non empty but I really don't see how that will give me an error.

 I have the following in my config
 (setq org-stuck-projects '("+project+LEVEL=1" ("NEXT" "IN-PROGRESS" "WAITING" "DONE" "CANCELED" "DELEGATED") nil "")) 
 And when I list stuck projects I get the correct output.
 The problem comes when I use the org-agenda-custom-commands like so:
 (setq org-agenda-prefix-format '(("r" "Weekly Review" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-skip-function '(zin/org-agenda-skip-tag "work")))) (tags-todo "+tickler-DEADLINE={.+}-SCHEDULED={.+}") (stuck) ;; problem here (todo)) ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down)) (org-agenda-files "~/.emacs.d/org/weekly-reivew-agenda-files.org")))) 
 Whenever I run this custom view, the list of stuck projects that is being produces is different than whats produces when I run the stuck projects command alone. I've tried passing the same list as I have above but doesn't change anything. I'm not sure how to debug this :(
 ​
 Org mode version 9.4.4 (release_9.4.4 @ /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/org/)
 Any ideas/hints would be appreciated! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 Yesterday, I finished up putting my first custom keyboard together. It comes with a lot of extra keys, a couple of which are bound to 'Hyper' by default. 'Hyper' is a 'modifier' provided by QMK (the firmware that powers this board) that maps to pressing 'Control-Alt-Super-Shift' all together. Because there are no default mappings in the Hyper space, it seems like a good place to put some global Emacs shortcut keys that will absolutely-for-sure not ever get clobbered.
 While it would be easier to bind C-M-s-<foo> instead of H-<foo> and get more or less the same effect, I would like to be able to utilize C-x @ h (event-apply-hyper-modifier) as an option to 'gracefully degrade' on computers where I don't have my keyboard (for example: the Chromebook I occasionally play with Emacs on). That way those global binds can stay available and reasonably within reach. It doesn't seem possible to chain C-x @ mod application functions together, but even if it were possible, chaining 4 of them together would get really old really quickly.
 I would prefer for this to get handled by Emacs instead of getting handled by the OS, just for that extra level of 'don't need to account for some random specific machine configuration', but I'm open to suggestions on what to do there if no good options exist on the Emacs level. My main machine (the one the keyboard lives at) runs mostly Fedora Workstation, and sometimes Windows 10 Pro (though I almost never use Emacs in Windows).
 Thanks, all.

 Is there any way to essentially shift the hard tabbed indentation to the left to remove the spaces but preserve the structure?

The easiest way would be to use the language specific icons, so I've done this, but the Icons looks not so nice in the sidebar (I use the small icons), they are blurred. Is there is a Icon size, I could use, so the icons I create look as good as the built-in ones? :-)

 Typically the files shown in Deft have the date/timestamp aligned to the right, but often times the date/timestamp end up moving a few spaces to the left for no particular reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Saturday Fellow Scala People!
 Quick announcement that Indigo 0.10.0 is now available for all your FP Scala.js game building needs.
 This release features a completely re-written Clone system for when you just have to render thousands and thousands of things, and new variation on the theme called Mutants! It also contains many bug fixes, API improvements, and performance enhancements - it even works on Windows!
 Please note that this is the first Scala 3.1.0 version, so if you have an existing project you'll need to upgrade!
 Full release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.10.0
 The docs are - possibly for the first time! - up to date and are now fully checked by mdoc: https://indigoengine.io/docs/quickstart/setup-and-configuration
 We now have a Giter8 template! You could have a simple game up and running on your machine in 5 minutes - why not give it a shot? :-)
 To get started, try `g8 PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8` or `sbt new PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8` from your command line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[SOLVED] Thank you all!
 I am attempting to create a custom theme using ThemeCreator, but this problem also appears for other custom themes that aren't installed in bare Emacs, but come from the color-theme-modern package.
 For these themes, and the one I created and installed from a local file, the colors appear to be broken in my terminal (bash via GNOME terminal on Manjaro + GNOME). Using TERM="xterm-256color" changes nothing, and in fact using TERM="xterm" is slightly better (in the sense that it's closer to the original theme).
 I suspect something fishy is happening though, as the real issues set in after I agree to run the Lisp from these themes. For example, let's say I'm running wombat theme but want to switch to taylor. Everything looks fine (or what I consider fine) in wombat, I navigate up to taylor and hit enter, the colors change to something that looks nice but probably isn't Taylor (maybe some previous selection that isn't wombat), but then as soon as I allow the Lisp from Taylor to run, I get an absolutely horrible scheme that is almost unreadable.
 All appears well in GUI Emacs, but I am not interested in using that unfortunately.
 I have also tried other, more esoteric settings for the TERM variable, but to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 I've been experimenting with Org Agenda recently for my school schedule, birthdays and other TODOs. I saw on the Org layer site that it can have agenda notifications and I thought "Great, I can have an useful agenda now that can remind me stuff!"
 But I simply haven't been able to get it working no matter what, this is what I have for my org layer in .spacemacs:
 (org :variables org-enable-github-support t org-enable-reveal-js-support t org-enable-org-journal-support t org-enable-hugo-support t org-enable-sticky-header t org-enable-valign t org-enable-notifications t org-start-notification-daemon-on-startup t) 
 Here's my Spacemacs config, if it's required. (also, I'm on the develop branch and it's up to date with HEAD).
 Anyway, if I add this in my agenda:
 * TODO Go for a walk <2021-11-12 08:30> * TODO Go shopping <2021-11-12 11:00> 
 I don't receive any notifications for those 10 minutes prior. Is there something I'm missing? Is it something wrong with perhaps org-wild-notifier that seems to be the Org Agenda notifier thingie? Thanks for your time!

 Simple todos:

 Statistics cookies:

 But what if I want to track tasks like these:
 * Jump 20 times [13/20] * Read 3000 words [1340/3000] 
 It doesn't make sense to break down this kind of tasks into subtasks, but I still need to track their progress in numbers.
 Ideally, I would also want org-mode to "understand" these numbers so that I can search/sort them out later.
 So, is there a good way to do this in org-mode?

 spark.sql("""

 FROM tC
 """).show(false)
 I have defined the dataframe as follows:
 val t1 = Array(35, 36, 32, 30, 40, 42, 38)
 val t2 = Array(31, 32, 34, 55, 56)
 val tC = Seq(t1, t2).toDF("celsius")
 tC.createOrReplaceTempView("tC")
 I am trying to do the same but without using spark sql, but I can't do it. This is the code works in Databricks azure cluster,:
 tC.withColumn(
 "fahrenheit",
 transform(col("celsius"), f => ((f * 9) / 5) + 32)
 ).show(false)
 In IntelliJ IDEA does not work. The errors are:
 - Cannot resolve symbol *
 - Cannot resolve symbol /
 - Cannot resolve symbol +

It happens quite often that while I'm writing a note I end up pressing ESC twice in a row (for example to cancel a search in the note, or the spelling box), and suddenly I lose the view of the note. While I can easily go back to the note, it still takes a bit of time to find the line I was at. Plus, there is an annoying break in the flow.
I was wondering if others had a similar experience and if they have a solution. Maybe redefining ESC with Keyboard Maestro, in such a way that one can still use this to cancel the other boxes (find, spelling etc.)? I find the role of ESC to Reset Search more intuitive in the Omnibar (when it's active), rather than in the body of the note itself.]]></summary>

 i'm using it to work with some scala 3 code courtesy of metals (0.10.9) and LSP. that's because i can't bring myself to invest time in vs code and because i've already set the record for intellij idea bug reports related to their scala plugin and scala 3:-). until recently, this setup worked well. 
 but during the last week, something strange started to happen. i use the tab bar in multiple windows. in one window with primarily text files, i was able to use the mouse to interact with the bar successfully (e.g. selecting a tab, closing a tab). but in a window dedicated to working with scala 3 code, use of the mouse with the tab bar began to fail.
 any attempt to interact via mouse button one triggered the error "<nil> <mouse-1> is undefined". "<nil>"? "describe-key" only sees the "<mouse-1>" event, no "<nil>". if i switch from Scala mode to Fundamental mode, normal behavior returns (the mouse can select tabs, close tabs, etc). if i turn Scala mode back on, the failures return.
 i'm looking for suggestions about how to debug this. thoughts/comments?

 Has anyone tried to do this before? 
 Just to clarify, the idea is not to apply different styles when publishing, but rather in-buffer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working with Scala (Functional) and Clojure for the last ~ 4 years but I still can't give a proper brief answer whenever someone asks me "Hey, what is FP and why should I use it?" 
 I generally start with concepts like immutability, local reasoning, referential transparency, functions as first class citizens, currying etc. But I soon find myself going all over the place. For example, I find myself giving unconvincing arguments when someone asks me "what practical benefit does referential transparency actually provide to the developer?"
 There are arguments like imperative programming depends on the order of execution of statements, while FP is declarative. But FP also depends on the order of execution (you insert into database and then read, you can't do vice-versa). Sure, you can say that "ordering" that we are talking about here is in the context of mutating global state. There isn't any global state in FP. But at the core of it ordering does matter right?
 Then there is the argument that immutability allows use of different cores in parallel. But I have never seen this happening in any business application, i.e, immutability used to parallelize processing. Sure, making a value immutable makes it thread safe (since no one can change it). But most real life scenarios require mutability. So we model them as Atomic, Ref etc and make them thread safe. But these things exist in imperative languages as well. So, what exactly is the connection between immutability and parallel processing & thread safety.?
 Then we have the lazy evaluation of IO which provides referential transparency. I have used IO and I love it. But I can't seem to find practical/objective points as to what benefits it provides. So when I say that all my DB operations and external API calls are an IO, I again find myself giving unconvincing answers about their benefits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past half year or so, I have really come to love Emacs and would like to contribute to this wonderful project. I sometimes do programming livestreams and typically use Emacs as my editor to try and introduce it to those who may not even be aware it exists. Since I am not much of a LISP developer, I feel like this is the best I can do to support the software and get more people using it; but I have found myself wondering how else I can contribute or introduce more people to Emacs. In my experience, once people realize how cool and versatile it is, they quickly become curious about its various functionalities. How can I help Emacs maintain its longevity?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I've been iterating over my previous shot at a Big Sur style icon and I've produced a new version that I consider to be more polished and hopefully a bit less amateurish. The changes are:
 - The background is now vectorized and sports a slight shadow at the sides and bottom, this is based on a svg template for Big Sur icons. It should be easy to make the background circular or squircular for those of you that prefer so.
 - I further smoothed the curves by removing extra degrees of freedom.
 - The logo shadow is now blurry and less opaque.
 - There is a subtle radial gradient that spotlights the logo and turns darker near the edges.
 - The upper and lower halves of the logo are slightly more proportionate.
 I've learned the basics of Inkspace and, against my expectations, I actually enjoyed using it :)
 I'm sharing a png image and its svg source (not permalinks, sorry, I promise to keep them online for some weeks at least).
 - png: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BDnwlGa17ds0CZI1kNBNghqt4TSqVEl/view?usp=sharing
 - svg: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14L_roGCSD9dMnhL4Cq3w2_sfP4vvlk0_/view?usp=sharing
 Hope you like it.

 As a workaround, pressing Ctrl-g during the search instead of Escape imitates the vim behaviour which I like .
 Is it possible to make the Escape key send Ctrl-g just during evil/isearch?

 I get aforementioned menu in scratch buffer on start ... but when emacs fully loads the menu it is the default one
 2) make the menu contain:

 xref-find-definitions for text which is marked in region
 ack for text which is marked in region

I have tried using the "search forum" capability, but it is not helpful unless I can remember something specific and unique about the discussion and what I posted.  And in any case, it feeds the request into my default search engine (Google or Duck Duck Go, or whatever), which somehow diffuses the search.
Sometimes looking at the "mentions" will help, if someone commented on your post, but not that often and you still have to wade through a lot of not relevant material.
Am I missing something?  Is there some way to see my past posts (on someone else's discussion)?]]></summary>

 Is there an ETA when a working version will arrive on Hackage or some kind of workaround for this issue? I could not find anything on the GHC issue tracker.

 What does this actually mean and why is it useful? 
 Then they go on to make their laws executable by using a library:
 import fpinscala.testing._ trait Parsers[ParseError, Parser[+_]] ... object Laws { def equal[A](p1: Parser[A], p2: Parser[A])(in: Gen[String]): Prop = forAll(in)(s => run(p1)(s)== run(p2)(s)) def mapLaw[A](p: Parser[A])(in: Gen[String]): Prop = equal(p, p.map(a => a))(in) } }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a project with ~200 hundred files and I wanted to move all of them one level deeper, so that all of my modules become prefixed with the name of the project. This results in me needing to rename all the module names, all the imports of those modules, and then also qualified calls in the code.
 Compiler guides me through that but it is a lot of manual work so I wrote a small script that does most of the work for me - it updated module names to reflect their paths and also corrects old imports to use the new name (it doesn't take care of qualified calls though).
 Script is pretty naive, in the sense that it uses just regexes and therefore risks false positives, but it actually worked very well for my use case, I had only 2 false positives which I easily fixed. I still needed to do manual work to find those false positives and I needed to correct qualified calls, but it still felt like much less work than without using the script.
 Script: https://github.com/wasp-lang/misc/blob/master/hs-fix-modules.hs .
 How would you go about this problem, what do you do / use? I tried looking for existing solutions, including retrie, but it didn't seem anything out there supports this kind of refactoring.
 If I wanted to make a proper solution that parses the code and looks at AST in order to figure out what needs to be updated -> how would I go about that, where would I start, and is that feasible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My font setup looks as belows.
 ```elisp
 (set-face-attribute 'default nil
 :family "FiraCode Nerd Font"
 :height 130
 :weight 'regular
 :width 'normal)
 ```
 But FiraCode does not support italic, so currently my emacs can't display italic.
 I found another font that supports italic and matches FiraCode font: Dejavu Sans Mono
 Now I want to mix both fonts. Main font must be FiraCode and I hope only italic letters are displayed by Dejavu Sans Mono.
 Is it possible for emacs to do this? I hope so and I am expecting it can do that. How can I write proper configuration to achieve that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am writing some bit level functions for Word128 data type in Haskell, and one function involves extracting n bits from the t-th least significant bit in a word x. I also intend to write a function that will essentially be a reverse of this above function of extraction (a function that basically restores the extracted bits). I have designed a C pseudo code for the extraction function, and this what I have written so far for the extraction function in Haskell-
 In C :
 extractBits (unsigned int x, int t, int n) mask = ((1<<n)-1)<<t; unsigned int extractedBits = x & mask;
 In Haskell :
 extractBits :: Word 128 -> Integer -> Integer -> Word128 extractBits x t n = x .&. (shiftL ((shiftL 1 n) -1) t)
 The above code seems to be fine type wise. However, a suggested solution that we have for this function is as follows -
 extractBits x t n = shiftL ( x .&. (shiftL 1 n-1)) t
 Not quite sure however I think the function above does not seem to be logically the same as my implementation? They are giving different results for some values. Does it have something to do with how overflow is handled by each if these functions? 
 Additionally, I am having trouble thinking about the reverse of this function and how it can be implemented. Any suggestions if possible would be much appreciated. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I am a new user of emacs, and really exploring the configuration options around. But I just found some very annoying aspects that are driving me crazy.
 First:
 How on earth can I just use tabs in a sane way?
 In VSCode I found tabs pretty smart. Press the key once, and it dropped you on the correct indentation level for the line, press it more times and it inserted spaces to your liking. In emacs apparently the default behavior stops at the first part, but for example, in PHP I'm writing a SQL string and to avoid wraping I press enter, but then it goes to the beginning of the line and if I press tab it just won't work because it thinks it is still at the correct level of indentation. and to correct the string I have to press space for doing so. I have no idea how to search for this in google, and the few posts I found give no solution whatsoever, and some say "just get used to it".
 Second:
 Are modes always "wonky"? For example, I am writing PHP at the moment, and web mode is pretty deficient for it, inserting a ">" character when I write "<" in a comparison because it thinks I'm writing an html tag. For that I installed PHP-mode, and now... formatting the file is impossible because it says that clang-formatter is not found. For web mode I installed Apheleia, and it works fine, but now I can't use it with PHP-mode. So how can I configure it so it works?
 And when I was just using web-mode, it suddenly, and apparently at random, just go back to fundamental mode. And had to enable web-mode manually several times. This is what made me install PHP-mode in the first place.
 I hope someone has an idea of how to fix this stuff, or at least point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance!

 I am currently working through the LYAH book and on the bottom of this page it goes into creating a Monad by example. So far, so good... 
 The only thing I can't get my head around at all is the final function:
 import Data.List (all) flipThree :: Prob Bool flipThree = do a <- coin b <- coin c <- loadedCoin return (all (==Tails) [a,b,c]) 
 In my head a <- coin results in a being: [(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)]
 same for b, and for c it results in [(Heads,1%10),(Tails,9%10)] 
 Now.. why does (all (==Tails) [a,b,c]) work?
 When I am loading it up in ghci and trying
 all (==Tails) [[(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)],[(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)],[(Heads,1%10),(Tails,9%10)] ]
 results in (as expected) countless errors.

 decodeUnaryOp w = do

 In place of the .... I intend to write something which will convert the UnaryOp to a Maybe type, however I am not sure how to proceed with this? Other than that, I think my code seems to be correct.
 Can someone kindly let me know to turn the result into a Maybe type? Additionally, if the code I have written so far correct functionally? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys!
 I'm in the middle of a project in which I need to do some kind of upsert to a nested map structure (3 levels deep), creating all the intermediate keys if they don't exist and just retrieving them and continue going down if they do. The structure would be something similar to this:
 haskell data NestedMap = M.Map Key1 (M.Map Key2 (M.Map Key3 [Item])) 
 You can assume Key* and Item are simple Strings.
 I wanted to try using Lens to do it, but I'm having trouble understanding some concepts. For example, I have seen that to manipulate map-like structures in this way at should be used, as well as non to provide the keys when missing and continue operating. However, when looking at the docs for non I have found this:
  &gt;&gt;&gt; Map.fromList [("hello", 1)] &amp; at "hello" . non 0 +~ 2 fromList [("hello",3)] &gt;&gt;&gt; Map.fromList [("hello", 1)] &amp; at "hello" . non 0 -~ 1 fromList [] 
 I don't understand the second result at all. Shouldn't the result be something like fromList [("hello", 0)]? Why it's not the case?
 To be honest I'm also having trouble trying to think on how could I chain all the ^.s, ats, nons and ?~s into an expression to finally add a [Item] at the bottom of the nested map, but as I'm not understanding the non function I'll need to go step by step.
 Could someone please help me understand this better? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellow 'macsers,
 TL;DR: wanna compile a number of lists (tracklists to show friends, one list per year), maybe in a kind of database. I want duplicates to be detected. Ideally, I want the ability to export to a nice-looking format. Package tips, programming suggestions, everything welcome. Thanks :)
 I have a somewhat unconventional taste of music - at least when compared to my friends. I rarely play music I enjoy personally other than some beat tapes which are simply lit when hangin' out together.
 Now, I have been asked by one friend of mine to compile a list of music that I have enjoyed throughought the year. Since I actually enjoy sharing/discussing music, I agreed. So I compiled a list of songs - free form, no format etc. 
 However, I've been wondering: I might be doing this every year from now on. First off, it was a bit tedious to do the freeform entry. Secondly, and more important, I don't want to manually search for duplicates when compiling my 2022 list. Finally, it would be nice if I could have this list (or a subset of such a list) exported either in a nice-looking pdf or in some other conventient form. 
 Then, I thought to myself: well, since you can do practically everything with emacs, why shouldn't it be able to help me out this time?
 Thus, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter. It might be some kind of database thingy that is able (programmably) to detect duplicates. It might be a program that does EXACTLY what I want. It might be a hint on how to do autonumbering on an unformatted file. It might be a tip on how to automate the "finding duplicates" process. Anything, really :)
 Thanks a bunch, have a good day, fellows! :)

Linked information systems
In providing a system for manipulating this sort of information, the hope would be to allow a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve with the organisation and the projects it describes. For this to be possible, the method of storage must not place its own restraints on the information. This is why a "web" of notes with links (like references) between them is far more useful than a fixed hierarchical system. When describing a complex system, many people resort to diagrams with circles and arrows. Circles and arrows leave one free to describe the interrelationships between things in a way that tables, for example, do not. The system we need is like a diagram of circles and arrows, where circles and arrows can stand for anything.


From Tim Berners-Lee's original proposal for the worldwide web. Emphasis mine.
It is quite fascinating how this fact seems to be rediscovered again and again.]]></summary>

 However, when I began using it, I discovered that the Projectile is not aware of any of my projects. In particular, whenever I try to switch to a project, it says that that directory is not a project. In the past, it would show me an array of projects in curly brackets in minibuffer that I could arrow through and choose.
 Here is what I have in the `.emacs` file related to Magit and Projectile:
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-x g") 'magit-status)
 (put 'upcase-region 'disabled nil)
 (require 'projectile)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "s-p") 'projectile-command-map)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "C-c p") 'projectile-command-map)
 (setq projectile-project-search-path '( "~/sites/" "~/Projects/"))
 (projectile-mode +1)
 (setq projectile-switch-project-action 'projectile-vc)
 (eval-after-load "projectile" 
 '(progn (setq magit-repo-dirs (mapcar (lambda (dir)
 (substring dir 0 -1))
 (seq-filter (lambda (project)
 (file-directory-p (concat project"/.git/"))) 
 (projectile-relevant-known-projects))))
  `(setq magit-repo-dirs-depth 1)))`

 There are do not appear to be any errors or warnings in the Messages or Warnings buffer. Any help on this is appreciated.

However, Grammarly is only officially supported on websites. VSCode has an unofficial Grammarly extension, I've tried it and it works pretty well. Is there a similar Grammarly package on Emacs?

 I posted my question in stack-overflow here, but I thought I might get a quicker response if I post it here as well. There was a question before on just auto-complete for python, but I am also looking for something that does syntax-filling automatically as well. I thought emacs-jedi (for python) was something close, but not fully what I was looking for. Any suggestions for just python or just tcl or both (preferably) is highly appreciated.
 Apologise if anyone feels I am repeating questions already asked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a couple of things that come to mind as a prelude to this issue:
  
switched to ZSH and Oh-My-ZSH a couple of days ago. 
 built Emacs 29 (latest from source) today on Ubuntu 20.04.
  
After installing the newly built Emacs, I noticed that the icon in the Ubuntu Dock didn't seem to work. I removed the icon. I then went into Applications and launched an instance of Emacs. It worked. I added it to the favorites in the dock. I closed the instance. I then went to click the icon again. It opened a weird Emacsclient instance, which didn't split the frame into three windows like it always does at startup (I have this written in .emacs).
 To summarize, whenever I launch from the applications, I can start a "normal" Emacs version. As soon as I add its icon to the dock, the icon begins launching Emacs(client) version.
 In the applications, I have three icons: Emacs, Emacs(client), Emacs(Terminal).
 Any help on figuring out what is going on is appreciated. For one, I would love to learn what this client thing is as I have never seen nor used it. It would also be great to get to the usual behavior of just getting good old Emacs after clicking the icon in the dock. If there is reason to this client madness and it can be beneficial in this case, I am all ears.

The subject is automating texture management through using statically analyzable code to implement the games and then analyze certain functions for the textures they use.
 The reason I need source code for games written in Haskell is to be able to compare metrics from a game without my added structures and typeclasses vs with my typeclasses. I would change the way the game is written using my classes and see what the impact is on performance, compile size/time, memory usage. 
 I will cite all the games used and their developers of course. I've found some github repositories here and there of finished games, but wanted to see if any of you know of some good resources.

I like Haskell. In my experience, it is at once the strongest and the most approachable programming language in the world. Haskell is the answer to the problems raised by John Backus and Edsger Dijkstra. It also has a community that I am honoured to be among. So, whenever I see a problem that can be solved by a computation, I want to have a solution in Haskell because I expect it to naturally turn out better than an alternative.
 Actually I even expect that a program written in a language without algebraic types, parametric polymorphosis and lawful type classes will exhibit stupid, e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce the release of Copilot 3.6, a stream-based DSL for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones.
 This new release supports three new operators: atan2, floor, and ceiling. Additionally, the target directory of the code generated by Copilot can now be customized. Release 3.6 also includes a battery of unit tests for the library copilot-core. This release introduces other fixes in the code and in the documentation, and deprecates definitions that have been superseded or that were largely unused.
 Current emphasis is on facilitating the use with other systems, and improving the codebase in terms of stability and test coverage. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started with JavaScript.
 Indium is suggested everywhere as the standard development environment for JavaScript, so I've used it with some success. It works beautifully for Chrome, with evaluation of code, inspection, REPL, etc. but only up to a point.
  
When it comes to Node, I've no success. I can start the node server but I cannot connect to it. I'm not sure it starts the node server correctly; in the documentation it says that you can start the node server manually and then connect to it, but the code says otherwise (it always asks if you want to close the previous connection, doing nothing if you chose `no`, starting a new server if you choose `yes`)
 Evaluating TypeScript code leads to errors, even though the documentation and the discussions that I've seen lead to the impression that evaluating TypeScript should be no different than evaluating JavaScript code.
 Async functions cannot be evaluated with `indium-eval-last-node` since it only evaluates the code after the `function` token, ignoring the `async` token, which leads to the error that `await` cannot be used in non-async functions.
 The Indium setup documentation references functions that are no longer available, like `M-x indium-connect-to-nodejs`
 the last commit is from March 2021 and there are still open issues from 2017 and no responses from the developer
  
Developing such a huge and nice package is surely overwhelming. I (and maybe others) would just like to know if we should bother with it, that's all. There might also be some people who would like to take it over, who knows. Does anyone have any info regarding this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a problem to solve which I'm almost sure has been encountered by people before (so expecting there to be reasonable library for that), but I don't know what exactly to search for. - I'd like to run potentially long-running actions triggered by some user HTTP requests in a web app - These actions have to run on the server receiving that request. Imagine something like initializing user-scoped sqlite file in the filesystem where the haskell web server binary is running (so no external "job runner" service) - The actions should run in separate thread (async?) - For any user, there should be at most 1 parallel copy of that action running at any given time (i.e. if user triggers 2nd copy of that action while the first is still running, the 2nd action should be skipped)
 My idea about solution so far includes: - some data structure (?) for managing bunch of locks, addressed by integers (user ids) - ensure locks are released both when the async action fails or succeeds
 Here's a dirty prototype (most likely not bug free) demonstrating what I'd like to achieve https://gist.github.com/jhrcek/5123bc0ad42522dff837be5580e9766e
 Is anyone aware of some libraries that would make this kind of thing possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently trying to get a webbrowser to work in emacs under Windows. Not really as a Firefox replacement, but more for having documentation or single sites displayed.
 From my research it looks like EAF is the best option for that. From their docs it seems like they support Windows. I did the full install as the Readme advises and everything seems to be working fine. At least the "demo" application runs as expected.
 With eaf-browser i'm at a dead-end though. All i get is an empty buffer and a Message "Process *eaf* exited abnormally with code 9". No further Information what failed. All dependencies are installed, update runs through fine.
 Has anyone gotten this to work under Windows?
 My current config for eaf looks like this:
  (use-package eaf :load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/" :custom (eaf-browser-continue-where-left-off t) (eaf-browser-enable-adblocker t) (browse-url-browser-function 'eaf-open-browser) :config (require 'eaf-browser) (require 'eaf-pdf-viewer) (require 'eaf-demo) (eaf-bind-key nil "M-q" eaf-browser-keybinding)) 
 Any help on this would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My new goal this year is to learn a new programming language and do at least one project with it. My current (uneducated) choice is between Haskell and C. 
 I’ve written down bullet points to help organize my thoughts, and I was wondering if anyone could share their thoughts on what to learn first and correct me if any of my thoughts are biased. I would really appreciate it!
 Here’s a little context for me first:
  
On a gap year before entering college as freshman next year
 Have done Java as part of intro to CS class + Python for majority of projects (overall ~3 yrs of coding experience)
 Interested in pursuing Machine Learning / ML Systems
  
My short term goal:
  
Push outside my comfort zone and gain a deeper understanding/practices in programming
 Prepare myself for rigorous CS curriculums I’ll soon face
 Hopefully, gain a small advantage in resume screenings when I apply for DevOps/MLOps internships after sophomore year.
  
Why Haskell?
  
The idea of Functional Programming itself interests me, and many have said it’s a great way to push outside the comfort zone and understand more deeply about ‘programming’
 I’ve heard many companies use Haskell for their “low-latency, high-volume database access”
 Project Ideas: Map-reduce?
  
Why C? (Or maybe C++)
  
Learning C will expose me to more fundamental inner workings of computer systems.
 As I am interested in ML Systems, I’ve heard “writing highly performant/error-proof systems-level code” is an essential skill to have/practice
 Project Ideas: Database, Distributed File System

 The library is still in development, so it's not as fully featured as JNA or JNR, but I'm hoping to improve it in the coming month. It's also very promising performance-wise: despite me not putting much of any effort into optimization, it's already rivaling JNR in performance, and resoundingly beats JNA.

 This is not your typical r/scala question about type classes or another generic job post – you won’t see any “in this role you will…” or “Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or equivalent.”

 Now you can run SPICE simulation for simple circuits in GNU Emacs. Since the circuit and graphs are in SVG format, you can easily share it on web or embed in a document.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I compiled Emacs PGTK Nativecomp and running it on my machine which is fairly good. Surely, using nativecomp is a new experience and everything felt very fast as compared to Emacs 27. But yesterday, I was facing Emacs freeze while editing a simple dockerfile which is hardly 100 lines ig and I inspected it in Htop and found that Emacs using 100% CPU. Then I killed emacs and run another instance and profiled it while editing same dockerfile but again I left with freezed Emacs. Again I tried same and found in profiler that evil (especially evil-ex command), timer.el(IDK what it is) and selectrum(precisely selectrum--update) using CPU. Then I removed evil packages from my init.el and replaced selectrum with vertico. Now, Emacs is usable. But it still lags (not freezes) in between and its due to native compilation turned on. 
 Is this only happening to me or anyone else facing same issue? Is there any workaround for it?

 ​
 Unfortunately, it looks like macOS Monterey regressed the performance of vfork, which means magit is once again slow and gets slower the more packages you have loaded. See https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2017-04/msg00201.html
 I'm curious if anyone out there has an M1 Mac w/ Monterey and Emacs 27.2 or greater and would be willing to run this and report back the timing information:
 (benchmark 100 '(call-process "/usr/bin/true" nil nil nil))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I've been learning haskell for school and I have an exercise Im trying to do where I have to implement a function firstWhen :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Maybe a, 
 the function is meant to return Just n if n is the first member that satisfies the condition and Nothing if no member satisfies the condition. So my first thought is to use foldl since it will check everything from the left to the right and I have my accumulator set to Nothing. 
 My current implementation is: 
 firstWhen p = foldl (\acc x -> if p x then Just x else Nothing ) Nothing
 The problem is it always returns the result for the final member. is there some way to make the function return the first member that satisfies the condition and then stop iterating? or am I thinking about this the wrong way? Thanks in advance for any tips or gentle nudges in the right direction :)

 Suppose you have an Org file for some purpose -- a particular project, notes on a topic, a draft document, etc. For argument's sake, let's say it's for a project called XXX, and the file itself is project_xxx.org. And suppose you want several sections. For example: a Description, a list of Tasks, a Journal area, a list of References, etc. Given that, there are at least two ways of setting up the org headings. 
 You could simply have the sections be level 1 headings, like this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I am currently trying to learn some haskell by going throught he LYAH book and got two questions.
 ​
 1) I think it was written when Applicative was not required for the Monad typeclass. It states in this capter (http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more) that there are some functions that do the same as the functions on Functors. But specifically written for Monads (e.g. liftM and fmap; ap and <*>).
  
Which ones are you using?
 Is there a rule of thumb?
 Perhaps something like "always liftM when the value is an instance of Monad and only fmap when it is an instance of Applicative and not of Monad?"
  
​
 2) There is a small task to do this tightrope walker example (http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads) with the Either type instead of the Maybe type.Thats what I did here and wondered if I could use the state Monad in combination with the Either Monad to clean up the code by avoiding all these ```first <- landLeft start second <- landLeft first etc..```
  
Is this possible? ( I did not yet fully grasp the State Monad stuff, so it would also be a decent practice I guess)
  
​
 ​
 thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are there good options for automatically adjusting text size for a frame based on the current display?
 I didn't find anything so I made a small package textsize that currently fits my needs quite well. It automatically chooses a font point size for the default face for the current frame, based on:
  
monitor resolution: if it's lower res, typically want a smaller point size
 pixel pitch: higher point size on finer pitch screens
 manual per-frame adjustment available to shift the calculated value
  
For me there is one current omission where automatic adjustment is fired via window-size-change-functions, which does not fire if the resolution is unchanged. e.g. Going from my 1080p laptop to a 1080p external. The only options I've seen for that require polling, which feels kind of distasteful. Anyone know of triggers I might catch for that?
 I could add rules around monitor size and/or frame size, though personally I haven't particularly wanted it. The manual adjustment is available for transient needs.
 I'd welcome comments both on the functionality, how I achieved it.
  
Is this reinventing another wheel I didn't find? This EmacsWiki page outlines some details but I didn't see automatic adjustment.
 
I feel like my coding of 'thresholds' is clunky and a little obtuse - are the Elisp examples of something similar that's cleaner and clearer?
 
My default pixel pitch thresholds are guesses, as my day-to-day doesn't have a lot of variation on that.
 
 If you want to try it, load textsize.el and run (textsize-setup), and move things between disparate monitors (providing their resolution isn't the same!). Tweak the customizations and let me know if you think the defaults could be better or if you would want other rules.
 I can put it on MELPA if there's interest, but I feel like it could do with a bit more depth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a senior developer with interests in pure functional programming with languages like Haskell. But I'm tired of companies expecting tonnes of experience in Haskell, Scala etc. I would like to shift my career from traditional Java/C# developer to Haskell developer. But I could not find any jobs and even if I find something, they expect me to have years of experience in Scala/Elixir etc.
 I'm from India and almost no companies here use Haskell. I'm burned out and came to conclusion that I'll never work in Haskell or any pure functional language. Is there someplace where I can find jobs for people with interest in Haskell?

 I have been thinking about switching to Emacs from Vim. I was using Vim since I tried to use Emacs but it was difficult to understand the configuration.
 The main use I would give it would be for web development with React and node. Any blog that you recommend me to learn how to configure Emacs in general. 
 Thank you very much for your help.

 Most of my work uses rectangle arrays.
 I would like to learn Haskell, but I find myself needing a pragmatic reason to use haskell in a way that works with my very schedule.
 For example, in my PhD I was using matlab. It is slow and not open, hence I started using Julia.
 In my work I was using R, it in open but still slow, hence I started using Julia.
 What reasons can I tell myself to start using Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm a psychology student from an Eastern European country. Currently I'm using the method to learn more about the neuroscience of emotions and personality psychology and how they are related to each other.
I was reading some neuroscience textbooks in the past few days and I wanted to take notes from them, because I know little to nothing about neuroscience. However, I have some trouble with finding connections between the notes in my Zettelkasten (probably because there are only two dozen notes and because I have deleted my previous Zettelkästen a few times).
I thought that knowing the types of links would help me with making the connections. These are the types of connections I know of yet:
So, do you think that having a personal typology of link types is helpful in making more meaningful connections between ideas?
(P.S. Stupid me deleted my previous Zettelkästen because I wasn't satisfied with the connections I made. Most of them were of the type "This is a note about object X, this is another note about object X, I can sense a connection!", which is a link type better encapsulated with a tag. Because of that I got few insights over the months I had been using the method.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using mu4e for a year and I am fairly satisfied with it except for how slow it can be. This slowness really annoys me when mu re-indexing blocks all other email operations including opening emails.
 I decided to switch to notmuch instead and upon configuring it (based on prot's config) it seems much faster and the fact that there can be multiple open searches and emails is a huge draw for me.
 However, there are features in mu4e that I want to replicate in notmuch, at least in the beginning while I get used to the tags system. These include:
  
Moving messages between folders and deleting messages.
 Multiple accounts and automatic context switching. In mu4e, when replying to an email the correct email account is used.
 Viewing messages from a search without the related messages in a thread. The tree-view includes all messages in a thread (and is not aligned correctly by default) and the non-tree view shows a list of threads rather than messages.
  
Does anyone have a configuration that implements these features?
 Finally, to be able to use tags, I am wondering if there's a way to sync notmuch's arbitrary tags with the mail server. I have two machines that access the same mail server and I want to configure notmuch on them separately, replicating the email tags (I cannot ssh to either machine from the other and I don't want to rely on a Dropbox like service to sync the notmuch database).

 ​
 But I think Monads are likely overmystified, what with the burritos and all. One thing, after I finish getting Monads, is that I'd like to explain Monads to my mother. She's not a programmer by trade, but was studying for a Java certification years back, so it might be a little bit easier.
 ​
 I'm wondering, does anyone else want to explain Monads to their mother? Even if they didn't want to do so, would you have a strategy for explaining Monads to your mother? Come and share, both proposals and experiences!

I started giving myself permission to use Structure Notes as much as I want, and I find these structure notes to be much more helpful than direct links from one note to the next.
If I have a stream of thought that spans 10 notes, I find it easier to back to the structure note to click through each note than to do a whole bunch of to/from links in each note.

 I have tried connecting to a local mac machine and a VPS. Tramp stucks at "Tramp: Opening connection nil for user@host using ssh...failed". I toggled debug on quit, and find that tramp stuck at tramp-maybe-open-connection . I also tried to use my mac machine to connect back to my arch machine, the mac machine is also on the latest commit ba278e4a9b, and they both have the same issue. Also, I have tried to open emacs using emacs -Q , but tramp failed also without loading my config.
 Tramp was working a week ago. All I did is compile Emacs from the latest source. 
 I am curious to see if that is my problem or a bug in Emacs. Does anyone of you unable to use tramp using the latest commit?
 Is there anything I can do to find out what is going wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm not sure if this is best place to post this question, but here goes. I'm working on a problem that requires an algorithm that finds all sequences of natural numbers that add up to a given number. So, for example, 4 is broken down into `[[1,1,1,1],[1,1,2],[1,3],[4],[2,2]]`. There's a solution online I found (https://origin.geeksforgeeks.org/find-all-combinations-that-adds-upto-given-number-2/), but it's for other imperative languages and doesn't translate well to Haskell. I managed to write an algorithm that works (I think), but seems to be terrible inefficient for higher numbers. I think trying to parse through it would just further confuse anyone reading. I was wondering what someone more well versed in the ins and outs of Haskell would do to implement this algorithm. Thanks.
 sumCombinations :: Int -> [[Int]] sumCombinations 1 = [[1]] sumCombinations i = filter (not . any (>9)) $ initialList : (nub . map sort . collapseCombinations $ initialList) where initialList = take i $ repeat 1 collapseCombinations :: [Int] -> [[Int]] collapseCombinations xs | (length $ tail computed) == 0 = [computed] | (length $ tail computed) > 1 = computed : collapseCombinations computed ++ map ((head computed):) (collapseCombinations (tail computed)) | otherwise = computed : collapseCombinations computed where computed = (\(y:ys) -> (y + head ys) : (ys \\ [head ys])) xs

When using `lsp-ui`, the documentation viewer, which appears in a childframe, causes a blank frame to be created when emacs is in full screen. This appears to happen with other apps as well that use childframes. 
 I've disabled using a child frame for the doc which is upsetting because the in frame version is way worse and doesn't have clickable links.
 Anyone know of a workaround? I'm new to emacs and still just trying to get my emacs config to work without major bugs.

 Recently I realized I have no idea how should I define version bounds for my library and I got pretty confused before I finally figured out the reasoning behind it (thanks to r/haskell and Adam Bergmark from Stackage), so I thought I would capture that reasoning in a short article: https://github.com/wasp-lang/haskell-handbook/blob/master/dependencies-version-bounds.md .
 I would appreciate any feedback, be it if I got something wrong or if I could improve clarity in some way.
 Article is aimed for Haskell developers that are publishing a library for the first time or are about to distribute their first executable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realize this is a common question - e.g. see here but I want to ask a slight variation on the usual case.
 I have created my own class file with definitions called my_article.cls, with code like:
 \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e} \ProvidesClass{my_article}[Article class with style modifications ] \LoadClass{article} \RequirePackage{titlesec} \RequirePackage{setspace} \onehalfspacing \RequirePackage[a4paper, hscale=0.8, vscale=0.8, includehead]{geometry} \RequirePackage{amsmath} \RequirePackage{amsfonts} \RequirePackage{amssymb} \RequirePackage{graphicx} \titleformat{\subsection}[hang] {\large\fontfamily{lmss}\mdseries\raggedright} {\thesubsection} {1em} {\underline} 
 To use this normally, I put this file in the same folder as the .tex file I am editing, and use \documentclass[11pt,letterpaper]{my_article}.
 I want to port this to org-mode, so that I can specify something like #+LATEX_CLASS: my_class at the start of the document.
 Is there someway that I can do this without having to repeatedly copy the .cls file into the working directory of the org file? I.e. specify this in my init.el file? For instance, this method in the worg tutorials is often suggested, but it seems to be for org-mode < v8.0.
 An alternative I've tried is to use #+SETUPFILE:~/my_template.org, which is a file that contains various #+LATEX_HEADER:\usepackage{} lines. This works for declaring which packages are necessary, and for defining shortcuts, but I'm not sure it will work for defining pagestyles for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings everyone!
 I am very new to the programming world and was introduced to this world by a friend of mine. After several hours of researching I accidentally stumbled upon haskell & the world of functional programming!
 At this very moment, I find myself puzzled about whether I should mainly write in haskell or not since the syntax of haskell, compared to other prgoramming languages, is rather more attractive I dare say.
 So I am here to kindly request help from more knowledgable haskell programmers to help me answer several questions that I am currently struggling to find answers to:
  
Should I be worried about software performance in general? I have been considering writing several applications in haskell that are somewhat performance dependent and as previously mentioned, I would rather have them be written in haskell than not if the performance is not strongly affected by this.
 Does haskell have good graphics libraries? If so, what is the performance disadvantage it has compared to languages like C/C++? I am interested in working with something similar to Inigo Quilez work.
 What is the current status of AI research in haskell? From my very simple searching, I noticed that it's not a popular programming language in the field of AI and I am honestly confused about why that is. Perhaps someone more knowledgable about this can explain to me why a language closer to mathematics is somehow further away from the mathematical research environment.
  
Other than that, I would like to thank you all for keeping this subreddit alive for newcomers like me to explore & learn from!

 The problem I have is with the Procfile. In the Yesod wiki it says that the file should contain:
 `web: ./dist/build/appname/appname production -p $PORT`
 ​
 However, that does not work. In the `heroku logs` it says that it can't find said directory. Also tried removing the production keyword for the command as suggested in a stack overflow question. Also tried ./dist/build/appname and every other variation :))
 ​
 Does anyone know how that path is chosen? Is it somehow linked with the buildpack that I've used?
 Any ideas on troubleshooting this?

While I know that a great guitar builder can be a terrible guitarist, I wonder if it matters that the "founding father" of the Zettelkasten system wrote books that felt disorganized and random.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, when I check my e-mail the mu4e-headers bar shows two strange icons, one looks like a christmas tree. LOL. I didn't modify anything in my Emacs config. In fact, I removed the entire ~/.emacs.d/ and let Emacs reinstall everything from scratch but the problem still persists. Did something change in the mu4e configuration style lately? I remember a couple of months ago mu4e switched to using the new :maildir style for configuration, then I updated it and everything worked fine until now. 
 Here's an image to see what I'm talking about: https://ibb.co/wzxN7gm
 And this is how my config looks:
 Fonts config ;; Default (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Hack" :height 180) ;; Variable-pitch (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "Hack" :height 180) ;; Fixed-pitch (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "DejaVu Sans Mono") (defun king/org-fixed-pitch () (set-face-attribute 'org-table nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'org-block nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch :foreground nil) (set-face-attribute 'org-code nil :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch))) Mu4e config :config (setq mu4e-contexts (list (make-mu4e-context ;; Personal context :name "personal" :enter-func (lambda () (mu4e-message "Entering personal context")) :match-func (lambda (msg) (when msg (mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg '(:from :to :cc :bcc) "zolikydev@gmail.com"))) :vars '((user-mail-address .

 I am getting the "Warning: assignment to free variable" for anything I setq outside of a lexical scope, as well as the Warning: the function ‘my-function’ is not known to be defined and I know that my-function is loaded, and even natively compiled. 
 Sure, I can defvar, and declare-function these warnings away, but why the difference? byte-compilation produces no such warnings.

 Chemacs2 uses its own functions to set the environment variable DOOMDIR
 ( ("vanilla" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/emacsen/vanilla/emacs.d"))) ("doom1" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/emacsen/doom1/emacs.d") (env. (("DOOMDIR"."~/emacsen/doom1/doom.d"))))) ("doom2" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/emacsen/doom2/emacs.d") (env. (("DOOMDIR"."~/emacsen/doom2/doom.d"))))) ) 
 Is it possible to use something like that to extend the PATH, ie ~/emacsen/doom2/doom.d/bin/doom?
 One way I can think of is run emacs with a script that adds the configurations bin/doom before calling emacs, but I prefer it do it in the manner Chemacs2 sets the DOOMDIR, within an Elisp configuration script.

 I prefer cereal over binary because the Double encoding in cereal makes sense, but cereal is lacking quite a few things that binary has, such as instances for Scientific. The lack of instances from packages can be quite an obstacle to consistently using cereal.
 Is there a package for cereal providing instances for Scientific? I couldn't find one. I'm wondering whether to write a package cereal-instances similar to binary-instances. It would be my first Hackage package. I'm wondering whether people will find it useful and whether I would end up semi-plagiarizing binary-instances since the code is probably very simple and similar to the one in binary-instances.

 I wanted a tool to discover and explore new code bases inside emacs. While I was looking for this tool, I saw some pictures of ranger and I really liked the layout. I wanted that kind of layout for emacs.
 So I wrote bfs :)
 ​
 BFS - by Tony Aldon
 bfs (Browse File System) implements for emacs a dynamic tree view of the file system à la ranger.
 This is a new "environment" accessible via the command bfs.
 I hope you will like it.
 ---> https://github.com/tonyaldon/bfs
 ps: As I said in the README:
  
bfs doesn't try to implement the features offered by ranger (only the layout),
 bfs isn't a file manager (I personaly still use dired, wdired and any shell for more elaborated tasks applying to files).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello community,
 Do you have suggestions on state of the art libraries or frameworks to parse huge XML files? Alternatively, what's the best approach in tackling this problem with Scala?
 ​
 Disclaimer: I don't have a CS or IT background and have very little experience with pure Scala, I mostly use Spark and Python daily, but I wanted to start filling my skills gaps within the data engineering realm for a long-term goal. I think I know the difference between SAX and DOM parsing, so I was looking for something to implement the former (amirite? :D)
 ​
 Disclaimer 2: this question stems from an interview assignment that required something like this plus other features (streaming solution, JSON output), but after spending too much time just on learning the different parsing approaches I told them I wouldn't proceed: even though it's something easy for the average programmer, it clearly shows my huge gaps in knowledge and programming skills. But I still want to work on it in my own time.
 ​
 Thanks a lot in advance and sorry if it's a silly question. Cheers!

 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("d" "Daily agenda and all TODOs" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 4)(org-agenda-tag-filter-preset (quote (""))))) (alltodo "" ((org-agenda-tag-filter-preset (quote ("-habit"))) (org-agenda-compact-blocks t) )))))) 
 The code should show me four days of schedule plus whatever TODOs I have lying around that aren't scheduled (showing both means this post doesn't really tell me what I'm doing wrong). But it either fully excludes the Habit tag (which is sometimes used for recurring/upkeep style tasks, like mopping the kitchen floor, and that "sometimes-but-not-always" nature of them excludes this post) or the command fully includes it, with no middle ground. I had hoped that setting the filter preset for each phase individually would prevent this (by making it have no filter for the agenda, and then a filter for the todos) but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.
 The code as listed filters out habit from both agenda and todo. If I remove "-habit" from the second instance of filter, it shows habits in both places. It does feel like the filter preset is only being checked once, but I'm honestly in way over my head already and at a loss for how to fix it.

 For me, I love Haskell because of it's huge potential for abstraction. And at least a lot of the time, abstraction means less, and more concise code. So, in many ways, I'd like to say that many Haskell libraries are actually "Low code" frameworks -- I think postgREST might be a perfect example of this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not (yet anyway) an eLisp wiz who can cook something up, but was wondering if there's a module that allows to export header and or selected buffer text section to another external app - a glue between emacs and OS context menu functionality. So one can 'export' to apps registered in 'Share to' context. 
 I am aware and using org-export-dispatch but this is different workflow. I'd like for emacs to be 'aware' of apps in context menu that accept text from other sources.

Im quite happy and have basically all I need (you never have all you need but being realistic here). However I would really like to have a helper like in doom emacs, when I press my leader or even normal prefix keybinds I got a popup buffer telling me my options and that was really helpful to remember old or not so often used commands. Right now I think I don't have too many struggles but that's probably because Ive just made the file and have all the keybinds set up and read all the documentation of dozens of packages, if I ever dont use a leybind but remember vaguely how it starts, it would be awesome not to use some find functions or scouting my emacs file and or package files for the answer. 
 Sorry for slightly over explaining, help would be appreciated, thanks for your time.

One of the most visible cost of laziness is hard to predict memory behavior, and so we

Most of the time, we live in a high-level world of type classes, monoids, and
isomorphisms. But at the end of the day our code needs to run on actual
machines, and when our code is run it needs to be performant. Typically, “be
performant”, means “have reasonable computational complexity” and so we usually
focus on good asymptotic behavior instead of constant costs. But when our
programs meet our CPUs, constant costs are important, and thus having low level
tools is helpful for low level optimizations, i.e., when you want to squeeze

 I am new to Emacs and have used it in the past few months mainly for VHDL coding. It had these wonderful shutter and electric modes which auto-filled the VHDL syntax making it easy for me to code (I was new to VHDL and emacs saved me).
 I have been using python for a few years now and wanted to enjoy some fun python coding on emacs. I mainly use libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib (pylab), pytorch and so on. I would really like to find a shutter-mode equivalent kind of mode for python. However, I am not sure of what to use since google had so many options and none of them very widely recommended. 
 So I would like you guys to help with some mode/add-on that would help me auto-fill the functions from these libraries and also any cool thing that would make my python coding with emacs fun!!

That is to say, I'm generally in the dark about Haskell package install. I did a stack ghci --package diagrams which seemed finally to install diagrams (after nine stack.yaml extra-deps additions) and start up a REPL (8.10.4). IAC, I could get the basic starter code DiagramsTutorial.lhs to load from the ghci prompt -- after doing :set -package diagrams-lib and :set -package diagrams-svg as it errored on Could not load module ‘Diagrams.Prelude’ etc. All right, then I tried as the tutorial says, i.e., $ ghc --make DiagramsTutorial.lhs This, however, errored out just like the ghci load with 
 diag1.hs:5:1: error: Could not load module ‘Diagrams.Prelude’ It is a member of the hidden package ‘diagrams-lib-1.4.3’. You can run ‘:set -package diagrams-lib’ to expose it. (Note: this unloads all the modules in the current scope.) Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. 
 and same for import Diagrams.Backend.SVG.CmdLine I'm confused over the whole stack versus cabal thing in general. BTW, what's the most popular IDE for Haskell? I've been using Emacs, trying to use the org-mode babel depending on a REPL session, which is iffy at best. Also, a $ ghc --version says 8.8.4. I'm confused.

Also, there was a compelling benefit of Stack handling ghc for me.
 However, recently I got more into learning about cabal due to trying to publish a library on Hackage and having to better understand what a cabal package actually is and how to determine version bounds for my library, for its dependencies.
 As a result I decided to write a small article that gives overview of what Cabal and Stack are and also compares them, based on what I learned: https://github.com/wasp-lang/haskell-handbook/blob/master/cabal-and-stack.md . I focused a lot on comparing Cabal with other package managers out there.
 I would love to hear if I got something wrong in it, or if I missed something - any feedback is very welcome!
 Article is aimed for Haskell beginners, but assumes they already had some experience with other programming languages.

 I'm sure its something simple I've overlooked, but does anyone have an idea here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last two-three days, I have been trying to wrap my head around functional reactive programming. I came across threepenny-gui while I have been trying to understand the concept.
 My understanding is that the difference between reactive programming as opposed to event-driven programming is that in reactive programming, one describes the behavior of the UI as a time varying function rather than how it behaves when certain events are triggerred. For example, Spreadsheet allow for reactive programming since we can say that a certain cell is related to some other cell in terms of a certain formula -- instead of having to say [When those cells update, change this cell according to this formula]. 
 When I look at the different examples included with threepenny-gui, I get the impression that they have not designed their programs reactively. For instance, if you see Mouse.hs, you see that they are saying
  on UI.mousemove wrap $ \xy -> element out # set text ("Coordinates: " ++ show xy) on UI.keydown wrap $ \c -> element out # set text ("Keycode: " ++ show c) 
 which binds the \c -> element out # set text ... handler to the events. This looks like event driven programming to me, instead of reactive programming. In a reactive program, one would just say that certain fields are bound to the coordinates of the mouse.
 I have also looked at Reactive.Threepenny and I think I understand the combinators but I do not understand how to use them to actually write reactive code.
 Is my understanding correct?
 If you have suggestions on how to phrase my code as reactively as possible in threpenny-gui, that would be welcome. If this is not the correct library for this sort of programming, what would be a good way to exemplify these ideas?

 My question is, 
 What about other boolean operators, e.g. and, xor and implies ?
 For example, 
 ``` (and 40 41 42) ;; => 42 (and 40 #f 42) ;; => #f
 (xor #f 42) ;; => 42 (xor 42 #f) ;; => 42

 Is there any well-known mathematical structures for and, xor and implies that play the same role as Maybe Alternative in Haskell?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes I want to create some one-off modes to control more of my day-to-day tasks from emacs. Elisp is fun enough to code in, however one thing I find somewhat daunting is putting things into a buffer so that it looks nice.
 I am sure there must be some higher level "widget" or tui libraries out there that speed up that process without fiddling with manual placement of text and text properties, faces etc. I would really love to collect together some libraries here that you know. I couldn't find another comprehensive resource for this.
 To make a start, here are some I'm aware of:
  
magit-section: Create a ui like magit
 Taxy: Uses magit-section but in some cases makes it even more convenient and fast to put data into a buffer
 Tabulated List Mode: Not to forget the built-ins, tabulated list mode can also help setting up a buffer really fast if a tabulated list is all one needs
 Hierarchy: Put hierarchical data into a buffer with several convenience functions to display, query and action callbacks. Seems to be merged to emacs and even though the library is there, there is not documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals, so the git repo README is still useful for documentation.
 tree-widget.el: There seems to be a tree-widget.el in emacs core, seems this also can be used to build trees in buffers but I haven't used it and there seems to be no documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals about it so I don't really know how useful it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are trying to get a working Haskell dev environment on MacOS M1, and are having various problems with the different approaches we have taken.
 Our project currently uses an older nixpkgs that comes with ghc[js]-8.6.5, but this unsurprisingly does not work and is likely a wontfix.
 The obvious choice was upgrading nixpkgs to a new version. However it seems like entering a nix-shell with ghc does not work, even for a very simple project. It complains about a broken compiler-rt-libc, and allowing for broken packages leads to a failing build of compiler-rt-libc.
 Surprisingly nix-build does work for ghc, however our project is too large for nix-build to be practical for development, as build times are on the order of an hour.
 Another problem with newer nixpkgs is that ghcjs doesn't work at all, again even on simple projects. It errors out with a complaint about the happy test suite failing.
 Yet one more problem is that while newer ghcjs on non-M1 MacOS does work, it is massively slower, taking on the order of a day to build our project, occasionally requiring restarts due to running out of file handles.
 There are also problems with running newer ghcjs versions on Ubuntu, as our project deterministically fails with an Data.Binary.Get.runGet at position 0: not enough bytes error.
 Due to the above we have been instead focusing on getting ghc-8.6.5 working on MacOS M1 without nix via Rosetta.
 However this has been very difficult due to C dependencies. We have uninstalled and reinstalled the necessary brew libraries in x86 arch mode, but cabal does not seem to be able to find them either way.
 So what I was more or less wondering was what other people have gotten working on MacOS M1, in case there is anything we can learn from that to get our project building on it.

 * TODO Task 1 * WAIT Task 2 * WAIT Task 1.5 
 ...where I forgot there was a task that needed to be done between 1 and 2, and have to add it in later. In this situation, the "chain-siblings" trigger keyword to move tasks from "WAIT" to "TODO" doesn't really work out - plus, what about situations where Task 1 is a blocker for multiple other tasks, not all of which need to be completed in sequence?
 The trigger that works based on IDs seems more generally useful, but also even less ergonomic. If you want Task 1.5 to be enabled automatically after Task 1 is done, you have to create a UUID for 1.5, copy it, navigate to Task 1, and create a trigger property for it with the copied UUID value - which would certainly be a pain in the ass to do from e.g. the agenda.
 Something like org-linker-edna would be nice, but its functionality is tied pretty closely to Helm (I'm an Ivy user). Is ergonomic dependency creation (that is, with completion) something I'm gonna have to script up myself, or are there existing developments in this space?

 org-src-tab-acts-natively is set to t as well. 
 But now when I write
 #+begin_src python def hello(): | #+end_src 
 the cursor is stuck at the start of the line and I can't use TAB to indent to add a new line, i.e. to make it look like:
 def hello( ): print("hello) 
 TAB used to work -- or atleast, I thought it was working. This github comment suggests that this facility was never actually available, and we always had to use C-c ' to edit code properly.
 Now, I have also set org-adapt-indentation to nil, because I prefer org-headings, sub-headings and text to be aligned with the buffer edge. If I set it to 1, it looks like there is some aligning going on when I hit TAB, but this is not perfect. Does this explain the "pseudo-indenting" that I had before, and there really is no inherent TAB indent in org blocks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started learning Common Lisp, mostly because there is a university class I could take in the future in which they just assume you already know the language going in; and so I downloaded the Portacle IDE, which is a bundle of (a forked version of?) Emacs, SBCL, QuickLisp, and Git. 
 Currently, I am only using Emacs for my rudimentary Lisp programming, because I don't quite understand how to use Emacs properly. To put it into perspective, I find the much maligned text editor Vim far easier to use than Emacs, even though I had never really used the terminal in such a involved manner before I started programming with Vim. 
 If I decided to download the "regular" version of Emacs to use for every programming language I know later in time, would that interfere with Portacle's version of Emacs?

But I am still fairly new to both web development and Haskell as a language, so it'd be great to have somebody on a similar level of knowledge to talk things through and help each other.
 We would work on a project from scratch (doesn't really matter what, it's just to practice and learn) for about one or two hours a day until we're satisfied with how much we've learned. We can do it in either English or Spanish (my native language)
 So, I'm sending this to the universe, hoping there's someone in a similar position to me... Just write here in the comments or DM me.
 Thanks for reading, and happy hacking!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This small package essentially provides glue code between org-odt-convert and org-table-convert-region, enabling one to open a spreadsheet file (e.g., xlsx, ods) or a text-delimited file (e.g., csv) in a special buffer, edit it with org-table- and orgtbl- commands, and then save it back to the original file in its original format.
 https://github.com/shankar2k/orgtbl-edit
 I made this package because I often find myself wanting to make small edits to CSV files that would be very convenient to do with org-table- commands (e.g., shift a column left or right), but I don't want to deal with the overhead every time of importing the file, converting it to Org, and then exporting back to the same file format.
 Because a picture is worth a thousand words, here is an example XLSX file:
 An example XLSX file.
 And here is the same file when opened in Emacs using orgtbl-edit:

 One thing to note is that for spreadsheet files, because this currently uses CSV as an intermediate format, when saving back to the original file, all formatting and formulas will be lost. 
 I hope some of you find this useful!

 Please have a look at the job description for more details about the company and the technology: https://boards.greenhouse.io/symbiont/jobs/4134418004. You can apply via the Greenhouse website and send me an email directly if you are interested ([eric.torreborre@symbiont.io](mailto:eric.torreborre@symbiont.io)).
 This position is opened for local (New-York) or remote work, both in the US, Africa and Europe (the team is currently distributed across EU and Africa).
 I happy to answer questions about our business or the particular flavour of Haskell that we are using on the job :-).
 Thanks,
 Eric

 My problem: for the life of me, I cannot find a way to specify the sender-email. All my mails always send with the default mail account. Is there a way to tell notmuch to send with another email?
 I should specify: using the terminal, sending mail with msmtp/sendmail works well with multiple accounts. The problem is with emacs itself not using it correctly... Or something?
 If you use this setup, how do you do specify the account you want to use to send the mail? Is there a configuration that makes this work?
 (I tried just editing the field in the compose window, but that doesn't work)
 Don't know where else to ask, seems like a good place. Couldn't find any good resource online.

 If we treat this as definitive:
 ​
 https://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2013/03/25/programming-languages-ranked-by-expressiveness/ 
 ​
 Haskell is about 33% more concise than Python, and 85% more concise than C++ / Java. It's less concise than Coffeescript by about 22%. However, this resource is sort of obsolete, and SLOC is not necessarily a good metric (it doesn't consider how many elements exist on one line).

I used this to automatically parse the official PHP YACC grammar and convert into into a format supported by my parser-generator library and export a Canonical LR(1) Parser in Emacs-Lisp for phps-mode.
 In the future I have planned to use this parser to build semantic data, bookkeeping of symbols and build the imenu index. It would be pretty easy to use the parser to transpile PHP to almost anything. My major-mode is in GNU ELPA

 Support for LSP via lsp-mode and erlang-ls
  
PEL attempts to unify the use of several commands. For instance you can use the M-. key for cross-refernce navigation with any of the supported cross reference packages that work with Erlang.

One thing I missed from my old setup was the ability to recall the last minibuffer I had open, using ivy-resume. Does something like that exist for Embark/Consult/Vertico, maybe as a plugin or something? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently learning Haskell, and am looking for an IDE that has features like instant highlighting of errors.
 I'm trying to write basic functions like get an Integer-list as input and apply some function, nothing complicated. But I fail to find anything usable, that helps me doing this. I just want to instantly know when I write total garbage. For example if my functions have the wrong type, etc.
 I'm currently trying to tweak atom with ide-haskell, but I only get default syntax highlighting of keywords. When I run ghci my_program.hs I get shitloads of errors because my functions are not even syntactically right. Is it possible to get these errors in the IDE while typing (like in any other language)?
 Is this all that I can get from this plugin, or am I missing something?

 I also get that if I make those operations non-blocking, I'm no longer limited in this way: I give an operation to a thread, it kicks it off, and then it's free for more work.
 What I don't get is how this is so. Is the thread handing the operation off to the os and saying "tell me when it's done"? If so, how does the os not get jammed up in the same way as our blocking/5-thread app? It seems like at some point there must be a thing that waits on the operation to complete.
 If it helps, here is an example of contrasting behavior: the first is async and parallel, the second blocking and parallel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! 
 I've started learning and practicing Scala less than a year ago for my current job, and so far I love it. I learned following the Coursera course from the wonderful Martin Odersky, but I quickly realised that my company was still in the middle of its transition from Java to Scala, with most of our code base looking more like scalaified Java than pure FP Scala like I learned at the beginning.
 I like functional programming, I've liked it from the first moment I learned common Lisp even thou the language felt antiquated, and, well, I wouldn't say I cried, but I was somewhat moved by the....purety ? Mathematicality ? of scala ( don't judge, IK my sense of esthetic is somewhat weird ). 
 Things seem to be somewhat moving in this direction at work, and I wanted to accompany this, and satisfy my own curiosity, by learning the move fp-extremist stuff I could find in Scala. 
 I could easily find resources on cats and the rest of the typelevel ecosystem, but then I discovered ZIO and that became my latest obsession. I like the project, I like how ZIO code looks and what the whole obsessive typing of everything thingy brings to me as a Dev.
 And then I tried to learn Zio 2.0 ( because why start with the old one when the next one is almost there ? ) but I have a hard time finding learning resources.
 Which bring me to my question ( thanks for reading my life story if you did ) : is the Zionomicon, and Zio in general, worth the time and money I would invest ?
 
 TLDR : weirdo ranting on his new fp zealotry wants to know if paying 50+ bucks for the Zionomicon is worth it

 ​
 Gives an answer like this.
 My question is if i could zip the lists of a list, so that i could get [(0,0,0) (1,0,0) (2,0,0)] and so on.

This looked very useful but I can't find the package name or video anymore. Does this ring a bell for anyone? I believe the package was quite new.
 Bonus question, I'm looking to combine a weekly and daily entries automatically. I would like to have a list of todo's for the week, defined in my weekly entry, and display those at the top of my dailies automatically (creating the weekly if no exists yet). I don't want to use carry over in org-journal as that doesn't quite do what I'd like. I'm certain this could be achieved somehow 😃

 I have built a table where some cells are filled via code-blocks that call external scripts.

 Is this possible?

 Hi there,
 I hope that the minibuffer prompts in emacs left bottom corner, such as M-x Find-file, which is produced by Function (minibuffer-prompt) defined in C source code, could be hidden/ disabled/ removed/ deleted.
 I have tried, but failed:
 (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda() (put 'minibuffer-prompt 'disable t)))
 (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda() (fmakunbound 'minibuffer-prompt)))
 Could somebody help? : (
 ​
 Update:
 It's done! Making selectrum + mini-frame + posframe pops up as company-mode does. Thanks _viz_ !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this doesn't make sense, but I'm struggling to find out how to express this question.
 Someone recently submitted a post or a comment about how they use use-package to configure all the packages they've installed in their init.el. I'm not sure exactly what I mean by all packages, I think I mean packages/settings that weren't installed using use-package ensure, or straight inside the use-package configuration, or maybe even that the packages weren't installed via MELPA, but by cloning a git repository. 
 In any case there was a comment that (briefly) explained how to configure the package setup and behavior using a use-package configuration; I thought I'd saved it but didn't, now I can't seem to find it. If anyone has any idea what I'm going on about, please let me know!
 EDIT: I believe what I was looking for was use-package emacs and storing Emacs settings like (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) there, as raised in this post, found by u/graduale and u/scbagley. From other comments, it sounds like you can also configure built-in packages like dired using use-package as well, so that's helpful. If you have any further thoughts on this, please feel free to add them!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce my first library on Hackage, jordan. Jordan provides abstract and inspectable JSON parsing and serialization, using the Applicative (for parsing) and Divisible (for serializing) typeclasses.
 Jordan has you define ToJSON and FromJSON classes in terms of instructions, such as "serialize a string" or "parse an object with these fields". These instructions are then evaluated by various interpreters, which actually do the work of parsing or serializing. This has a few benefits:
  
Intermediate structures are entirely avoided: there is no Map.Map Text JSONValue anywhere in the library, and JSON fields are directly parsed using permutation parsers. This also means that we can always serialize a JSON directly to a bytestring, avoiding the need for anything like toEncoding from Aeson
 Since JSON interaction is kept abstract, you can generate documentation for parsers and serializers, directly from their definitions. This is provided in jordan-openapi.
 This library provides a fun excuse to use contravariant functors, so you can feel like a super small functional programmer
  
The github page for this project is located here. While I'm not gunning to replace Aeson or anything, I would really appreciate any feedback anybody has to offer!

 Taking the principle to fibers, is there any thread-safety or practical problems with using mutable state inside fiber (think vars), as long as the state is not share with other fibers? I'm not talking about Refs, which use AtomicReferences under the hood. I'm talking about closing directly over mutable state, and reading and writing to it as required on a per-fiber basis.
 An example of this may be the re-use of buffer: Array[Byte] in this part of the Cats Effect tutorial.

add allow-loopback-entry to ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf (then run gpgconf --reload gpg-agent)
 make sure that epg-pinentry-mode is set to 'loopback in emacs
  
however, after doing that I still see that
  
when running emacs in X what pops up is pinentry-gtk-2, and
 when running emacs in a console what pops up is pinentry-curses

 I am pretty new to Haskell and have been looking around on the internet for a solution, but none have had the specific "problem" that I have.
 ​
 I could maybe use pattern matching. In my head this is the best bet I have, but that won't work, because "obj" is given and based on the pattern match either an Int or String is returned. In no way or shape can I return all the "properties" of this Set.
 ​
 Any ideas, tips, tricks?

 I was watching this great talk on Reproducible Research by Thibault Lestang, demonstrating the power of Org Babel. His org file is here:
 https://github.com/tlestang/org-mode-reproducible-research/blob/main/org-mode-examples/RR.org
 The initial C++ code block works great to produce the array initial_data, but the subsequent python code block to plot the array doesn't work:
 #+header: :var timeseries=initial_data :results file :dir "./figures/" #+begin_src python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt timeseries = np.array(timeseries) plt.plot(timeseries[:,0], timeseries[:,1]) plt.savefig("timeseries_vis.png") return "timeseries_vis.png" #+end_src #+RESULTS: [[file:figures/timeseries_vis.png]] 
 If I run the above I get: 
 #+RESULTS: file:figures 
 and no actual png output file is produced. If I run the block in :session mode that gives me IndentationError: Unexpected Indent. If I remove the indents and re-run I get SyntaxError: return outside function. I can get rid of this error by re-writing it as a function, and it then works. But I'd really like to know what is wrong with the original code, and how can I run it without :session? 
 Many thanks!

 I have browsed the dired chapter on emacs manual, but have not found how to do something very simple: preview file contents like with ranger. With ranger I can move up or down over a list of files with arrows, and I can preview their contents at the side, regardless of the content being simple text, image, pdf, etc. How can I do the same with emacs? I saw a video of someone doing that with Doom Emacs, however I am not keen on using Doom or similar packages, I prefer to have a simple init.el that I can understand.

 mySort :: Ord a => [(a, b)] -> [(a, b)] mySort = sortBy (compare `on` fst) 
 but I am not sure how to do it with [(GameState, (Int, Int))].
 I've attempted sortBy and sortOn, but I failed.
 Once again, thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on Scala library that implements ordered sets and maps. We all familiar with these mathematical concepts and widely use them in daily life. There is a lot of examples in our systems: activities are related to ranges of dates and time in job planning, filters with intervals in online shop, etc. Scala's standard library provides the great collections framework. But it implements ordinary sets and maps, for ordered ones there is no such thing (upd: i'm sorry for some confusion with terminology, please see comment).
 Here is the first post describing some basic ideas https://ordset.blogspot.com/
 Project is now about 33k lines and is already somewhat useful. However, there is still a lot of work to make it really powerful. Any feedback is very welcome!

 Morton Ordering
 If you have multidimensional data and interleave the binary representation of each key, you get a neat space-filling curve called a z-order curve. Ed wrote a series about using them to do sparse matrix multiplication.
 I've also seen them used when you need to crunch multidimensional keys into a single dimension e.g., when you need to be able to use a DynamoDB sort key to search across multiple dimensions.
 Contravariant Tricks
 In Ed's discrimination library (see also: the talk Discrimination is Wrong: Improving Productivity), he uses the contravariant hierarchy to sort all kinds of things really quickly. Many instances …]]></summary>

 That said, I would really really like a way to integrate org-mode functionality on my Nextcloud server. So I was wondering if it's possible to compile emacs to WASM.
 The biggest problem I foresee, as far as usability goes, is that the browser would swallow/usurp/hijack many of the default emacs key chords. For evil users, this is not such a problem, :-) , but not everyone is evil.

However, the name conflict between lense and traditional field selectors makes it a bit awkward to use : you either go full lenses or at all. Mix and match doesn't really work.
 Also having to rely on TH induces some problems, and type errors can get overly complicated.
 I basically given up on them (the only real use being nested update which are kind of rare, and should be solved soon within GHC).

 I see there are many backends out there, and dart supports many purescript data types (with some lack). Also not sure how to deal with the mutable aspects of dart in the purescript side.
 If this is a feasible work to do under two months I would give it a try and ask for some help in order to build a robust open source backend with the goal of becoming a real ASAP.
 Is there any information relative to making new backends including standardized tests? Is there anyone interested willing to contribute?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I encounter some font spacing problems on macOS when I switch my font from time to time: especially when the default font :weight 'light is used, something about bold constructs throws whitespace off, of all things -- the space character is rendered a bit too wide, then.
 (defun ct/use-face (font weight height) (let ((the-font (format "%s-%d:%s" font height weight))) (message the-font) (setq default-frame-alist (append (list `(font . ,the-font) '(min-height . 1) '(height . 45) '(min-width . 1) '(width . 101) '(vertical-scroll-bars . nil) '(internal-border-width . 24) ;; frame padding around the text '(left-fringe . 0) '(right-fringe . 0) '(tool-bar-lines . 0))))) (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font font :height (* height 10) :weight weight) (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font font :height (* height 10) :weight weight)) (defun ct/use-medium-face () "Use Roboto Medium 18pt, for smaller screens" (interactive) (ct/use-face "Roboto Mono" 'medium 18) (setq-default line-spacing .2)) (defun ct/use-regular-face () "Use Roboto Light 22pt, for larger screens." (interactive) (ct/use-face "Roboto Mono" 'light 22) (setq-default line-spacing .3)) 
 I would love to replace this manual font switching, which might be broken, with something more robust that ideally adjusts to the frame size.
 Use case
 I'm switching from my MacBook's 13" Retina display on the go to a 1440p ultra-wide at my desk, and enjoy different font settings for each. The desk's monitor is further away from my face and I use the 22pt font setting for most of the time there. That's way too big for the built-in laptop screen, though, so I use the 18pt font variant there.
 Do you know of any well-tested package that supports changing font sizes (and weights) to make the best use of a frame's size given the circumstances?

now that a major leap forward (for me) is done with the second edition (the beta phase in German begins soon and after that I will attack the English translation), I am turning my eyes on more specialised applications.
The development of the second books so far was driven by beginning with Luhmann as the core idea and unfold it with the help of philosophy of science. So, I deem the foundation to be layed out.
The next two branches that start to grow (in my Zettelkasten first) are:
Specialised applications of the Zettelkasten
Thinking tools that work within the frame work of the Zettelkasten Method. Cognitive Mapping is an example. (Big shoutout to u/thomasteepe for the term Integrated Thinking Environment (originally Integrated Thought Development Environment))
The first aspect is now what I am preparing in my Zettelkasten. So, I want to ask you if I forgot an important user case. In my Zettelkasten, I have the following:
Students
Teachers (Mostly geared towards the German Schools System at the moment)
Bloggers
Visual Artists
Fiction Writers
Non-Fiction Writers
Lawers and judges
Theologicans (and studying the bible)
Scientists
Humanities
Non-Scientists (~private use like dog training, cooking, hobbies, child upbringing etc.)
Anything missing?
Live long and prosper

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs has cooperative threading which AFAIK does not prevent a badly behaving thread locking up the UI. Since real multithreading is hard to add to Emacs could forking support alleviate this? 
 So unlike emacs-async which starts with a fresh emacs, you could create from lisp a copy of the current process with all the settings, variables, etc. being the same, so, for example, a lisp autocompletion library could use fork to spin up an other process and calculate the possible completions of the current position, returning these asynchronously to the parent process thereby not interfering with UI updates.
 I know creating processes is more costly than creating threads, but with today's computers it may be still fast enough to produce asynchronous results for completion, etc. without blocking the UI thread.
 Forking is supported by all major OSs, so could this be a good enough solution for async processing?

I've found a couple of tutorials, guides, docs, and walk throughs but to a person new to all this, it can be a bit overwhelming. So, to help the next new guy who comes here I'm posting my org configuration complete with comments. 
 I doubt most people will use org anything like what I need to use it for, however this configuration shows you how to configure a lo of things that might not immediately be obvious and will hopefully serve as a good foundation for building your own work flow.

 I know that the "outermost" :override wins over the "innermost", and if they are at the same depth then the last one to be added wins. But how I can see what depth they have and in what order they were added?
 Based on my init.el and package sources I suspect that in my case they are at the same level and the consult-* function was provided as advice second. But how can I be sure? I couldn't find a way to inspect the details of a function's advice with a look through the elisp manual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generators in Haskell can either take the form of lazy lists or some generator library.
 Lazy lists are wonderful to work with, but may be hard to create for some sequences (such as those which require the use of mutable state to generate efficiently).
 Various generator libraries make it easier to generate such sequences, but the trade-off is that using them is typically more cumbersome. 
 Theoretically, one would be able to get the "best of both worlds" by converting a generator to a lazy list. Is there a good way to do so in Haskell? If so, what is it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, some quick background on me:
  
I am trying to get into Scala as I wish to work with Spark. I have good scripting knowledge in a few high-level languages (PowerShell mainly, plus Python and general Bash/awk scripting), and I'd like to break into a more rigorous programming paradigm. Another potential plus is that my company product is written in Java. I don't implement any code, but I do handle its technical implementation and design augmentations for customers. I may find an opportunity to leverage Scala in the JVM for some side projects to help me practice. 
 At any rate, my motivation for learning Scala is that it seems well-aligned with my goals and circumstances for entering a more programmatic world.
  
Books
 After looking around, I've picked out 3 books:
  
Programming in Scala Fifth Edition
 
Hands-on Scala Programming: Learn Scala in a Practical, Project-Based Way 
 
Programming Scala: Scalability = Functional Programming + Objects
 
 I saw a lot of good things about Programming in Scala Fourth Edition, and being that it's written by Martin Odersky, it seems like a solid choice. However, the Fifth Edition claims to have been overhauled for Scala 3, and it's too new for me to find any reviews on how this overhauled edition has turned out.
 Hands-on Scala Programming has good reviews and seems like it might be oriented toward a beginner specifically with its "project-based" approach. However being published in 2020, I'd expect it to have been written for Scala 2. I figured if I am jumping into Scala, I should go for a Scala 3 book.
 The book by Dean Wampler seems like a solid book, but I can't find much info on it in terms of reviews.
 Does anyone have experience with any of these books and could provide their 2 cents on it?
 Thank you!

In this case I restart that command, find the history item, copy it, cancel the command, start the command I want and paste the history item into it.
 This is cumbersome, so I created this small code which keeps track of commands' history usage, and it can show the recent history items of the recent commands for quick selection.
 Just load it, use Emacs for a bit, so it can track some minibuffer input usage and then invoke the command otherhistory-choose-from-other-history to quickly recall and insert a recent history item of a recent command.

 ​
 When trying to open org-agenda
 org-element-cache-map: Symbol’s function definition is void: native-comp-available-p
 ​
 I fixed this by adding
 (defun native-comp-available-p () nil)
 to my org configuration (just making sure this function is avaialble before calling org-agenda. (I am not using native-comp - still using Emacs 27.2)
 ​
 I can't seem to track down where this function should be defined. Is there something I should have installed but missed? I was surprised by this error.
 ​
 Anyways hope this helps someone else and if you have any ideas as to where this error originated I would love to know.

 I'm trying to automate grading of Haskell assignments. I don't know whether the students have defined all of the functions I need to test. Thus, I'd like to run something
 ghci> try (map foo [1,2,3])

 ghci> map foo [1,2,3]

 I know shell/bash well enough to do this there, but it would be nice to be able to do it in Haskell. Is it possible?

 Source (a): [ { name: "Patrick", age: 40, job: "Programmer" }, { name: "Jonathan", age 30, job: "Teacher" }, { name: "George", age: 20, job: "Office worker" } ] Target (b): [ { name: "Bob", job: "Policeman" },//person added { name: "George", job: "Office worker" }//Order changed, is now before Patrick { name: "Patrick", job: "Haskell Programmer" }//job changed //Jonathan removed ] Expected result (a): [ { name: "Bob", age: null, job: "Policeman" },//person added with default age { name: "George", age: 20, job: "Office worker" }, { name: "Patrick", age: 40, job: "Haskell Programmer" }//Job updated //Jonathan removed ] data Lens a b = Lens { get:: a -> b, put:: b -> a -> a } 
 How can I write the "put" function that takes "Source" and "Target" and returns "Expected result"? The put function must align the persons by name (key based alignment).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've made a socket daemon of emacs , going through the guide
 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html , in which emacs daemon runs as soon i startup systemd.
 But i've found that just running "emacs" doesnt connect with that server, we have to put
 "emacsclient -nw" or "emacsclient --create-frame" for gui, in order to have as many as client but one server. i put in gnome, "emacs.desktop" to run that emacsclient gui. but it takes "2 seconds to load" , while normal emacs command loads in 0.6 second. with in that, It automatically closes when i dont touch it . I also tried to add 8.8.8.8 "emacs" on /etc/hosts but it doesnt works. 
 I think dont understand , about client and server on emacs, which is client or which is server and what should i put in order to run emacs client in that server. 
 I've taken reference to make .desktop put "emacsclient --create-frame" and run from 
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/31704/run-emacs-gui-from-emacsclient
 ​
 anybody please guide me, 
 I'm on debian, emacs 29, doom emacs .
 Thank you please

 I've been using org-tree-slide, which works fine for simple presentations, but I'm looking for something slightly more elaborate while still working inside emacs (i.e. no org-reveal or beamer). Something that offers a few presentation commodities like simple animations and a little more control over slide appearance. 
 Is there such a package?
 ps: I've looked into org-present, but it seems to be even more bare-bones than org-tree-slide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 cgroup-rts-threads is a new library that solves a problem we experienced while running our haskell code in docker containers.
 In short, the GHC RTS -N flag will happily spawn threads exceeding a container's configured cpu limit, leading to drastically reduced performance.
 See the package README for details.
  
We'd be happy to accept contributions, including one to reduce the dependency footprint -- this code was previously part of a bigger codebase.
  
Somewhat relatedly, a quick plug: we're actively hiring for a haskeller to join our team (remote - US/Canada/Argentina) to work on our dependency analysis tool and associated backend components.
 This is the first package we've published, and we'd love to contribute some more. Come help us do that!

I checked the key binding and it reports org-capture-finalize. Same result in Gnome terminal and Alacritty. 
 Any ideas what variable or settings may have caused this behavior? It was working as designed a couple of weeks ago. I recently got doom package running, but no change when I comment that out in the config.

 Thank you in advance for your consideration.

 org-agenda-skip: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-in-archived-heading-p
 I tried clearing my straight cache and pulling a few more times, nothing seems to fix it. Looking at the elisp for org, the function org-in-archived-heading-p seems like its defined in org.el, so I'm confused as to why the symbol isn't being found.
 Has anyone else seen something like this?

 However, when I went to 'recover session', it doesn't seem to be possible to get back to where I was.
  
the relevant .saves-[etc]~ file seems to only list unsaved files, so apparently if there were things I had had open but had saved they don't appear. Non-file buffers also don't seem to be listed.
 when i attempt to recover the session, it asks if I want to recover one of the six files listed, then seems to quit. Even when I press ! which the help tells me will 'recover all remaining files', it only reopens the one.
  
​
 I'm starting to accept the idea that I won't be able to get back to where I was last night, but is there a way to set up emacs so that it saves all aspects of a session, so that next time I can actually recover and get back all my frames, windows, tabs, and buffers after a forced (or even voluntary...) shutdown, not just a single unsaved file?
 And (Or?) how do I get it to at least recover the other files M-x recover session knows about but doesn't seem to be reaching?

 does anyone know of an open source project/web app/library, written in Haskell, that makes terminal interface accessible via browser?
 An example of what I'd like to achieve:
 Start R repl process withing a docker container on the backend (e.g. `docker run -it --rm rocker/r-base`) and allow user to interact with it using terminal-like interface from their browser (with stuff like TAB completion working etc.)
 It seems that xterm.js is a popular choice to implement the client side of such a thing,
 but I'm looking for some inspiration of how a backend of such an application could be implemented in Haskell.
 Examples in other languages that do similar thing to what I'd like:

 When I started developing strong-path, I haven't specified any dependency versions in package.yaml, since I knew it will pull whatever is provided by the Stack resolver I am using, and that worked fine for me.
 At some point I started needing the newer version of `path` package than the version that was present in the LTS resolver, so I added `path-0.9.0` und…]]></summary>

 I've been doing some type-programming lately, and realized the stuff I'm writing is significantly different than the world as it existed in 2018. We now have quantified constraints, HKDs, kind-generics, and all sorts of other cool techniques. 
 Since 2018, there have also been lots of other books! I haven't been great at keeping up --- but has anything superseded TwT? If so, there's probably not much reason in pushing out a new edition.
 But if there's sufficient interest, I'd be more than keen to put it together. Let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,I'm trying to create a "visit_count_file" property for each org file I have. The code I'm doing should:
  
create the property value equal to 1 if it's not here yet
 increments the property value each time you open the file
  
Here is what I came up with for now
 (defun lkr/increment-visit-count () "increments the 'file_visit_count' property +=1" (interactive) (org-entry-put 0 "file_visit_count" (number-to-string (+ (string-to-number (org-entry-get 0 "file_visit_count")) 1)))) (defun lkr/update-visit-count () "creates or increments the 'file_visit_count' property" (if (org-entry-get 0 "file_visit_count") (lkr/increment-visit-count) (org-entry-put 0 "file_visit_count" "1"))) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'lkr/visit-count-update) 
 the problem is that it creates the property value in the first heading of the file if the heading is in the first line, and create the property at the top of the file otherwise. How can I do to always put the property at the top of the file?
 behavior:
 ​
 * first heading :PROPERTIES: :file_visit_count: 1 :END: 
 wanted behavior:
 :PROPERTIES: :file_visit_count: 1 :END: * first heading 
 I just started to fiddle with org mode and emacs lisp so I'm not very good at it. Thanks for reading.
 Bonus question:would it be easy to do the same but instead of putting it in a property drawer, putting it in
 #+visit_count_file: 1 * first heading 
 like this? what would be better in your opinion?Thank you again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I only use non-Emacs software for two things. Web browsing and calendars. In my effort to never exit Emacs (I spend way too much perfecting it to spend time on other apps), I want to tackle calendars next.
 I currently use Google's calendar. I have been looking for ways to use Emacs' calendar but I couldn't find solutions that check all my boxes:
  
Ability to subscribe to multiple calenders (via ics urls).
 Ability to have multiple calenders (like in Google, for example, I have one for work and one for personal events).
 Ability to create, delete and edit events.
 Ability to sync calendars with Google calendars (and Microsoft calendars if possible), so I can check events on my phone.
  
I imagine that these requirements are shared by others, so there must be a way to satisfy all of them. I just couldn't find it.
 Does anyone have a working setup for calendars that they can share?
 Thanks.

 There's tons of .org_archive files littered around my repo, and if I complete two different tasks on different machines, I get merge conflicts in the archive files. I think I'd rather just have it delete the entries and use Git in the unlikely even that I need to dig through the archives -- I think it's happened maybe two or three times in the 12 years (yikes!) I've been using Org Mode.
 I guess the only thing I'd be missing is explicitly recording TODO completion. If I just delete the TODO, it could have been done and closed, or unnecessary and not done. I'm definitely not going to change state, commit, delete, commit -- I think I can live with that loss for a cleaner repo.
 Is there a thing that makes archival work better with Git repos? What are y'all doing for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a task that I've done using some Emacs and some command line tools (sort and cut), but it's slow and error prone and I reckon I could do it all in Emacs, but I don't quite know how.
 ​
 Please help me learn how to write some elisp to solve this...
 ​
 My problem:
  
I want to sort lines in a file based on a date string in the line itself.
 For simplicity: 
 There are two types of lines, but the structure is consistent within a type.
 type A might be: INSERT INTO tableA VALUES (something, something, '2021-11-11 11:11:11.111+00', something);
 type B might be: INSERT INTO tableB VALUES (something, '1999-12-31 01:01:01.001+00', something, '2021-11-11 22:22:22.222+00', something, something);
 I want the second date string in type B
 
 So based on seeing uniqueA or uniqueB in the string I know where(ish) the date string is
 Naturally, each line has different data for the something values and different date-time strings.
 There is a chance that the "line" may actually be broken with new-lines in the text, so what I know is that it starts with INSERT INTO and ends with );\n
  
​
 What I've done
  
Emacs: Define keyboard macro to search for tableA, then isearch-regex-forward for ..-..- to get my date string, copy that string, move to the start of the line, paste with a following space. C-u to apply lots of times, iterate until I have done all the lines
 Emacs: Define keyboard macro to search for tableB, then blah-blah-blah paste date at start of line with a following space. C-u to apply lots of times, iterate until I've done all the lines
 Jump back to my shell. sort the file, cut -f3- -d' ' the file and then I have my sorted file.
  
(I tried working out how to do the Emacs part in sed, but failed to see a useful example online...)
 ​
 This approach is complicated and error prone and not very reproducible.
 How would you go about it in Emacs?

Upon discovering Ormolu in 2019, I was first appalled by its style, but this reaction was only short-lived, as I found these stylistic preferences to be easily malleable via familiarisation.
I started using Ormolu for all personal projects, and submitted bug reports and minor pull requests. Therefore, an internship to work on Ormolu full-time came like a call!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vital Biosciences is a company based in Toronto (Canada) building a medical device aiming to revolutionize medical diagnostics. Because of the size of our stack we use a variety of languages, to choose the most appropriate tech at each level of the stack. We use Haskell, SQL, and Rust, with a splash of C and Python where it makes sense.
 Quick Facts:
  
This is a remote position. If you prefer an office environment and live in or are willing to relocate to Toronto that works for us.
 We are looking for a mid/senior level hire. We love to hire junior candidates with great promise, but at this point the team isn't yet large enough to share the training effort.
 The working hours for this position are in Toronto local time (ET)
 Authorized to work in US/CA is a slam dunk. Other countries are possible but we may need to do some investigation before we promise we can make it happen.

 I'm a haskell developer here and I was asked to share this posting. One of my favorite parts of the job is working alongside a science team and a hardware team to make a thing I can touch. It's a refreshing change of pace from working at companies that just produce a cloud service. I'm happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability!

 This is some part of my .emacs config file. When I start Emacs and input M-x sly or M-x slime, I usually would get an editor and a REPL. In the editor, I should have lispy-mode on automatically (if according to the config), however, I still need to M-x lispy-mode to get it to work. So I was wondering that where I did it wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rather than having a control or special key based command for changing window sizes, or having to remember and use a lengthy Emacs function name (enlarge-window-horizontally) for example, I'd like to set up an evil statusline command like so
 (evil-ex-define-cmd "ewh" 'enlarge-window-horizontally) 
 so I can use :ewh instead. (There are also other ways to get the same effect, but I'm using this for now.)
 This works (which is good), but it only grows the window by one character width, so I'd like to be able to use "." to repeat it. However, this command does not appear in the ring for some reason, so whatever was used before :ewh is what ends up repeated.
 How can I use this alias/command I want while also having calls appear in the ring so they are eligible for repetition by "."?
 Unfortunately, prefacing the command with a number like :5ewh does enlarge the window by five characters, but it also moves me to line 5. This approach would also be okay if it didn't navigate to a new line.
 Thanks!

I'm quite comfortable with Haskell, and I have an existing Vue.js + Typescript application that I wrote (and host at https://iguanasuicide.net/) but I'm not really comfortable with npm / node / vue -- there's no specification I can read ala the Haskell Report so I'm always uncertain when editing the configuration. I'm even uncertain on the latest Typescript changes -- I learned it from the specification that is no longer updated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if this is a bug, or really where to go to start debugging.
 I'm on a mac, and testing this on a prebuilt Emacs 26 from homebrew, and emacs 28.0.60 I compiled. It seems that in my v28.0.60 if I open a tramp connection to a remote server that is behind a VPN, if the VPN connection is killed, emacs completely freezes. (to test, I just open a dired remote directory, and sever the connection. Instant beachballing.) I've tried setting tramp verbose mode to 10 and sending SIGUSR2, but am having trouble getting useful information (for me). Once the freezing happens, I can't recover and its becoming extremely frustrating. SIGUSR2 can at least let me get back into emacs, but in a debug mode. The only message I could see was about a premature ending and Forbiddent reentrant tramp. (I don't have the exact messages right now, but could get them.)
 I do have a copy of my v26 emacs, and it does not have the same problem. When the VPN/remote connection is killed, emacs locks up for a few seconds, before it simply times out, and I can keep going. Annoying, but not a show-stopper.
 In each case, I am starting with emacs -Q option and the only extra command I'm using before opening files is ido-mode.
 I did stumble on  this issue  which mentions that start-file-process-shell-command was changed between v26 and v28. Is what I am noticing something related to that?
 The behavior is very different between versions on the same computer (and ssh configuration), and I am loading things with the "-Q" option for no init file. Any pointers to how to track this down would be helpful. Did I compile without some magic flag in the configuration that was needed?

Since I was running a wayland based desktop I thought to install the gtk3 version since gtk3 natively supports wayland as far as I know. like I said everything is fine just the text is slightly blurrier then I would like and can't seem to find a fix for my specific situation

 type family Last ts :: * where Last '[t] = t Last (t ': ts) = Last ts 
 When using the type family as part of a program, I'm encountering an error as follows (summarised):
 Could not deduce: Last ts1 ~ Last (t : ts1) from the context: ts ~ (t : ts1) NB: `Last' is a non-injective type family 
 From my understanding, the last type in the list ts1 must be identical to the last type in the list t : ts1, the presence of an extra item at the beginning should not have an effect on which item is at the end. Therefore, Last ts1 should be the same as Last (t : ts1), but GHC cannot guarantee this.
 What changes can I make to get my code to compile?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I apologize for this question but I have been trying this for a while and getting a bit stuck.
 I have installed the Emacs Application Framework and been messing around with it. It's awesome, but I can't play video files in it! As far as I can tell, everything is set up as it should be but it simply is not playing anything.
 Here is the relevant portion of my .emacs file:
 (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/") (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/app/eaf-video-player/") (require 'eaf) (require 'eaf-browser) (require 'eaf-pdf-viewer) (require 'eaf-terminal) (require 'eaf-video-player) 
 As you can see, the video player is indeed installed. I also installed qt-ubuntu from snap and ffmpeg from apt (I am on Ubuntu) to see if either of those would help (they didn't but I haven't restarted my computer since I installed those so maybe that would do something [update: rebooting did not do anything]?)
 The web browser, PDF viewer, and terminal work just fine (I haven't messed with the other plugins yet). However, when I try to run the video player on a video file, this happens.
 As you can see, the video editor is in fact on, in some sense, but nothing is here! I am not a Linux or powerful text editor newbie (I am a recent veteran of Neovim which i customized heavily) so I know may way around installing stuff and troubleshooting, but I'm nowhere near experienced enough to debug super complicated issues, so I've found myself stuck here. Any ideas on what might be going on?

 This might be a stupid or rather difficult question. When you are surfing on the web, and you come across a tutorial that you were looking for hours, and you consider that tutorial or parts of it a piece of gold to avoid boilerplate and save tons of hours of re-googling, how do you store that information using org-mode? 
 Technically speaking, we are talking about non-actionable information that could be used potentially in the future. Do you use org-roam for this kind of stuff or what? And how do you organize the files, independent from your GTD workflow (if you have)? 
 Would love to hear your methods, since I have a lot of tabs temporarily saved in bookmark on Firefox but I know that I would like to store that information filtered and processed by me. Thanks!

 It's shy though:
  
it pops up a tiny window that disappears if I try to screenshot it (and comes right back after the screenshot is taken).
 
C-h k C-S-e doesn't even help!?
 
C-q C-S-e doesn't want to quoted-insert it.
 
Search engines have never heard of it apparently.
 
C-g doesn't extinguish it. enter and esc do.
 
For both global and local, (local-unset-key (kbd "C-S-E")) doesn't unset it.
 
 So how does it behave?
 It opens a tiny window, that you can type in, and if you hit enter it places those contents at the cursor. But you can't type spaces. The tiny window is draggable. The tiny window has a hardcoded character e at the beginning of it, for who knows why.
 What on earth is this?

 Here's an example writing tracker implementation done in Google spreadsheets: https://thespreadsheetwiz.com/automatic-writing-tracker/
 I don't need something as elaborate. But there doesn't seem to be any solution that pairs word count with clock data.
 There are a few packages that will count words for you, such as org-wc, which produces nice overlays of total word count per subtree: https://github.com/tesujimath/org-wc
 Or tracktable that embeds a table with a daily word count into your buffer: https://github.com/tty-tourist/org-tracktable
 But nothing that combines word counts with clock data, both of which I have in my file.
 Unless I missed something? Please let me know if you know.
 I use DOOM if it makes any difference.

 I use evil mode and wanted to setup EAF Browser in my Emacs.EAF Browser works as expected but the keybindings between EAF and Evil clash . I have to switch to Emacs Mode for EAF and Evil Mode for others, this setup is very irritating and unproductive. How to use EAF Browser with only Evil Mode ?
 The EAF wiki only has instructions for DOOM Emacs and Spacemacs users , I tried to implement it for normal evil mode , but was unsucessfull. Does anyone have a setup they can share ?

 We have `shift` and `reset` for performing continuation, but it is hard to wrap my head around what these does..
 Like, what does "captures the continuation up to the nearest enclosing reset" mean?
 Why does it capture up to the enclosing reset? How does it interact with callCC and others?
 I am lost. Could you give me pointers on how to understand it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I've written a small "proof of concept" type package nrql.el for interacting with NewRelic (an application performance monitoring and logging tool). In my current job, I do a lot of investigation into our production issues. org-mode is a huge part of my daily workflow, and I wanted something that would make it easier to save NewRelic queries (and their results) in org-mode as I typically will export an org-mode heading to html to format the text in a way that is easy to share between many different services (Confluence/Jira/Github/ect.). 
 If there are any other NewRelic and Emacs users out there hopefully this is useful! Also, I'd love some feedback elisp wise as it's my first serious attempt at writing a package for Emacs. A lot is still pretty rudimentary like error handling, but if you have interest in something like this let me know as it currently meets my needs, and I'm wondering if I should take it further.

 (straight-use-package 'org) (with-eval-after-load 'org-agenda (setq org-agenda-files '("~/todo.org")) (setf (cdr (assoc 'todo org-agenda-sorting-strategy)) '(effort-up)) ;; Sort just by effort (setf (cdr (assoc 'todo org-agenda-prefix-format)) " %i %-12:c %-6e")) ;; So I can see effort in the todo list 
 If I then do M-x org-agenda t, I'm presented with
 todo: 0:30 TODO C todo: 0:15 TODO B todo: 0:45 TODO A 
 However, if I comment out (straight-use-package 'org) (i.e. using the built-in Org instead of the latest version), I get the expected output of
 todo: 0:15 TODO B todo: 0:30 TODO C todo: 0:45 TODO A 
 org-version and load-history confirm that the first version is using Org 9.5, while the second is using Org 9.4.4. Did sorting agenda items by effort change in 9.5?
 For completeness, inbox.org just looks like:
 * TODO A :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:45 :END: * TODO B :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:15 :END: * TODO C :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:30 :END: 
 I'm on GNU Emacs 27.2, with Arch Linux, Linux 5.10.64-1-lts x86_54, and Org 9.5-g531577.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was doing a problem sheet to play around with haskell syntax and I have to write a function :
 graft :: Rose -> [ Rose ] -> (Rose , [ Rose ])
 graft = undefined
 which takes a "parent" tree and a list of "child" trees and grafts each of the children to the leaves of the parent as we move from left to right. What is the most efficient way to do this?
 Notice how the function returns two pieces of data: the grafted tree as well as a list. This second value can be used if the length of the list of children does not match the number of leaves of the parent. For example, if there are not enough child trees in the list, your function should simply continue without modifying the remaining leaves and and return the grafted tree as well as the empty list. Conversely, if there are more children than there are leaves of the parent, then your function should return the grafted tree as well as the list of child trees which are left over.

 LaTeX looks difficult for the (incremental) recursive-descent parser one might use to hold a parse tree in-memory for structural navigation and editing. Is this a hopeless endeavor for an all-in-Emacs solution? Should I look into a tree-sitter plugin instead?

 As far as I can tell, the way to do this would be to supply the output of (region-beginning) and (region-end) to a function that would insert text at a point.
 Unfortunately, I can't find a function to do this, or even functions to manually set the point, and then use (insert) to place the text.
 Am I going about this in the way? I know it's a very simple task just to write the tags, but I have to do it a lot and would like to automate it.
 EDIT: I figured it out, the function is a little hacky, but it does work. Note: the mess in the (insert) functions is to make it output \( \), disregard it.

        <link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/qferyv/iron_v112_is_available/"/>
        <updated>2021-10-25T11:36:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.1.2.
 What is Iron ?
 Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.
 Here is a simple example: ```scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.log)
 log(-1d) //Compile-time error ```
 New features of 1.1.2
 Mathematics
 This release make Iron closer to mathematics by providing two features: - A new A / B alias which has the same meaning than x € A / B(x) in mathematics. The old A ==> B alias is kept but deprecated for retrocompatibility reasons.
  
A new algebraic system allowing the user to write their constraint like a mathematical equation: ```scala
  
def acos(x: Double / (-1d <= ?? <= 1d)): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.acos) acos(1d) //Right(0) acos(1.5) //Error ```
 Check this page for further information.
 Compile-time evaluation support for composed constraints
 Before 1.1.2, constraints like And, Or, Not etc... Weren't evaluable at compile-time. They were evaluated at runtime only. This update now allows you evaluate complex/composed constraints at compile-time: scala def acos(x: Double / (Greater[-1d] && Less[1d])): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.acos) acos(1.2) //Compile-time error 
 Note: Compile-time evaluation is also supported by the new algebra system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an exercise, where I have to write a function that returns True if the first parameter's list's length is larger than the second parameter (Int type).
 Now, there's a test case where the first parameter is an infinite list ([1..]), therefore I can't just simply write `| length x > y = True` in my pattern guard, since that would cause an infinite loop. How can I check if a list is infinite or not? If it's infinite, then the function should always return `True`.
 ​
 EDIT: The second parameter is only a number, so my example should look like this:
 longer [1..] 3000 == True

 I have looked up on google and found a similar problem in this google group. 
 Like if there is a {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} or a single line comment in the first line, this error will show up.
 Everything can build successfully so I think the problem is on VScode...
 Is there anybody encountered with the similar problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am testing a method that deals with a Coordinate case class:
 ```scala case class Coordinate(azimuth: Double, elevation: Double)
 def method(arg: Seq[Byte]): Coordinate // represents a point on a globe ```
 I need the method to be approximately equal to the value corresponding to the catalog entry for the byte sequence that represents it. Basically, I need this test to pass:
 scala val testValue: Seq[Byte] = ??? assert(method(testValue))(approximatelyEquals(Coordinate(azi1, ele1))) //values from spec catalog correlating byte sequences to expected Coordinate values 
 The signature of approximatelyEquals is
 scala def approximatelyEquals[A: Numeric](reference: A, tolerance: A): Assertion[A] 
 I am unsure of how to make this work with the Coordinate class. I need an instance of Numeric for Coordinate, but it doesn't make much sense, since for example it's not possible to order points on a globe.
 Basically what I need is to make sure that the elevation and azimuth values are close to the azimuth and elevation values that are expected. As it relates to the title, I need to get an ADT to understand the typeclass of its arguments, if it has arguments that all have the same typeclass as this type does.

If so here is what I have to do
 Implement the function puzzle, it will simulate the game similar to 15 Puzzle. In our case, we have 25 squares, where 24 squares are ocupied by tiles with big case letters from 'A' to 'X'. One tile is free, it is denotated by ' '. In one move, you can move a tile (denotated by its letter) into the free one. The function gets the original configuration and a sequence of valid moves. It will output the resulting configuration.
 If anyone would help me I would really appretiate it, though I am quite broke so I can't afford paying, I am rellying on generosity and charity of this community

 With the advent of Emacs 28's native compilation, it's only possible when we apply the highest available native-comp-speed (which is non-default) so it's unreliable.
 Today I happened to jump into named-let in subr-x.el, which according to the manual can be used just like Clojure's loop - which can be utilized in place of TCO funtions - therefore I decided to define a clone for the latter.
 lisp ;;;###autoload (defmacro clj-loop (bindings &rest body) "Evaluates BODY in a lexical context in which the symbols in the BINDING-forms are bound to their respective initial bindings or parts therein. Acts as a recur target." (declare (indent defun)) `(named-let recur ,(seq-partition ;; Convert vector to list (append bindings nil) 2) ,@body)) 
 ```lisp
 (clj-loop [i 0] (if (= i (expt 2 20)) i (recur (1+ i)))) ;; => 1048576
 (defun fibo-2expt (num) (clj-loop [a 0 b 1 n (expt num 2)] (if (zerop n) a (recur b (+ a b) (1- n))))) (fibo-2expt 3) ;; => 34 `` Although initial expressions' indentations are a bit funny & there's no destructuring, I think it's still helpful to share, because I haven't seen anyone suggestednamed-let` as a built-in workaround for TCO.

 ​
 How do I add I implement Foo.equals(Foo) for Foo / for every extending class? (So Bar.equals(Foo), Baz.equals(Foo) would need to be implemented.)
 Ideally Bar(x1) == Bar(x2) <= x1 == x2, Baz(y1) == Baz(y2) <= y1 == y2.
 Does it need to be a sealed abstract class rather than a sealed trait?Foo must be sealed because I need to use pattern matching.

 Does anyone have a good solution for spell checking a long LaTeX file?

 I'm confused as to why the last line in the following code gives a compile error
 type CacheObject a = { fetch :: forall m . MonadEffect m => m a } get :: forall a m . MonadEffect m => CacheObject a -> m a get c = c.fetch 
 while the following does not
 type CacheObject a m = (MonadEffect m) => { fetch :: m a } get :: forall a m . MonadEffect m => CacheObject a m -> m a get c = c.fetch 
 The compile error starts with
  Could not match constrained type MonadEffect t3 => t3 a1 with type m0 a1 
 Can someone explain why this is?

 ​
 I found this interpreter for the lambda calculus using de Bruijn Notation and GADTS:
 https://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/functional-programming/2013/Code-20140123.lhs
 data FExp :: * -> * -> * where 
 App :: FExp e (a -> b) -> FExp e a -> FExp e b 
 Lam :: FExp (a, e) b -> FExp e (a -> b) 
 Var :: Nat e a -> FExp e a > 
 ​
 data Nat e a where 
 Zero :: Nat (a, b) a 
 Succ :: Nat e a -> Nat (b, e) a
 ​
 My Questions is: Whats the best way to parse expressions like \x y z -> y to something of this type? 
 My problem is that i need a state to return the right Nat e a.
 Would it be better to write an Type FExp' that can also contain lambda expressions that are not well typed and write a parser with type String -> FExp' and a second function of type MonadError m => FExp' -> m FExp'? Thanks for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I'm sharing a minimal recipe to build emacs with native compilation in macOS. More precisely, to add native compilation to your already working build procedure. I've found that it's extremely simple nowadays but also that instructions are scattered around the web, often outdated, sometimes hit-and-miss, sometimes buried deep inside complex build scripts that do a bunch of other things. So I wanted to get an up-to-date minimal working recipe and actually understand what I was doing instead of blindly copy&pasting code. The outcome gladly surprised me as trivial.
 Assuming you have brew installed and have checked out emacs-28:
  brew install gcc brew install libgccjit ... ./configure --with-native-compilation ... 
 Remarks:
  
gcc is not the compiler used during the traditional build. Instead, the clang installed alongside your macOS command line tools will be picked as usual. But gcc will be the one compiling elisp to native code (please correct me here if I'm wrong).
 
--with-native-compilation flag is not required (it's already the default!) but by adding it you ensure that any issue while enabling native compilation gets reported loud and clear. If there is any problem, try this in order to diagnose it: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html.
 
Be prepared for long build times. Also, you might feel disappointed the first time you launch your new build of emacs. But this is likely because the JIT compiler is compiling your packages (you may see a bunch of compiler warnings in *Messages*, new files appearing in ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache and some processes burning your CPUs).
 
I'm on Big Sur 11.6.
 
 EDIT: I've been using it for a while it's really, but really, snappy! Now that I'm typing in this reddit textarea it feels clunky as in 2 hours average latency.

 Emacs IDLWAVE mode version 6.1_em22. HTML help location not found: try setting ‘idlwave-system-directory’ and/or ‘idlwave-html-help-location’ Cannot locate IDL Assistant, enabling default browser. Loading system routine info in idle time... Failed to convert XML routine info, falling back on idlw-rinfo. [...] 
 Whaat? All I did was add ob-prolog, set a var for the program name, and put a #+SRC block in an Org file. Well, almost all.
 After getting schooled on Interactive Data Language and Emacs' IDLWAVE package (it has an info manual), and an hour of my life I'll never get back, I tracked down the issue. I had created a prolog code file, likes.pro, and guess what file extension IDL files have. I had a likes.pro buffer and IDLWAVE liked it. 
 Fun fact: one of the authors of this package is Carsten Dominik.

I have not really used any logging framework with Haskell and from my research there doesn't seem to be a defacto standard. Let's say I use co-log in the library wouldn't this force this onto people who want to use my library in their project? Should I not implement any logging at all and then add the logging in the parent project? Kind of miss just being able to put console.log(), console. error() where it's needed and not worry about logging in the first place.

I see that you can run Xcas under emacs as well, but I largely have to use khicas because of the memory limitations on the calculator, I trust there are better desktop-oriented cas systems out there 
 Is there 1. A good CAS for Emacs, and 2. Can I link it into Emacs-Calc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I recently started learning Scala, I know very less about it until now. I setup Visual Studio code for Scala, installed an extension called 'metals'. I also installed scala and sbt on my OS. I already have jdk-openjdk (which is version 17 currently) installed.
 I researched a little bit and found scala 2.13.6 supports jdk 17. Still everytime I open a Scala file on VS Code, it asks me to install jdk 8 or 11 specifically. The twist is I can compile and run my programs on both on my distro's terminal emulator as well on vscode terminal emulator.
 I just want some additional knowledge based on above issue happened with me and what if I completely uninstall jdk-openjdk and install jdk11-openjdk?
 would I be able to compile and run both Java and Scala programs piecefully (errors aside Lol).
 Thanks for your time and efforts.

 For about 20 years the program used a built in IDE+debugger called "VLIDE" (Visual Lisp IDE). This program does what it's supposed to do but is terrible.
 They have now deprecated this and urge people to use VSCode, which has some sort of LSP support via an Extension
 Supposedly this does all the cool stuff I need in VSCode. I would much rather use Emacs!
 What is involved in making this work with the best editor? Is it a drop-in replacement of some sort? Is it legal?
 I don't really know how remote debugging works, even though I used it in my Java/EE days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm experimenting with using a clean build from straight.el in order to reproduce a bug I'm chasing down, but got sidetracked in this endeavor by experiencing some other weird behavior (a familiar story to all the members of the Church, I'm sure).
 I launch Emacs with emacs -Q -l ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el, then evaluate the following buffer.
 (straight-use-package 'org) (require 'org) (with-eval-after-load 'org-agenda (setq org-agenda-files '("~/todo.org"))) 
 After this, I do M-x org-agenda t, move the cursor over an entry, and do C-c C-x e to assign an effort. If I then do e.g. "0:15 RET" though, I get a "Symbol's function definition is void: org-duration-to-minutes" error. Weirdly, this error goes away if I remove the line (require 'org) from the above config.
 I've checked, and the straight.el build files for org do have org-duration-to-minutes listed as an autoload in org-loaddefs.el. I feel like my brain is just mush after the work week. What am I missing?
 edit:
 I'm on GNU Emacs 27.2, with Arch Linux, Linux 5.10.64-1-lts x86_54, and the latest version of Org, 9.5-g531577.
 Doing M-x list-load-path-shadows yields the same results for both of these cases - after running org-agenda, 114 packages are shadowed (everything from the built-in org is shadowed by everything in straight/repos/org).
 The load history is a lot to parse through, but the only important thing I've found so far is that after I call org-agenda, org-loaddefs.el appears in the load-history of the version without a require statement, but not in the version with a require statement.
 edit2: Solved! See my comment below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m trying to use backpack to do some limited form of polymorphic unpacking (which GHC unfortunately does not support ‘natively’). Essentially, I want something like:
 data Node a b = Leaf {-# UNPACK #-} !b | Node {-# UNPACK #-} !Index {-# UNPACK #-} !a {-# UNPACK #-} !Index type Index = Int bimapNode :: (a -> c) -> (b -> d) -> Node a b -> Node c d bimapNode f g = \case Leaf b -> Leaf (g b) Node l a r -> Node l (f a) r 
 for particular types a, c, b, and d. The issue that I'm essentially running into is that I'm not sure how I can get my hands on the copies/instances of the 'Node' type used by the library that implements 'bimapNode'. A more detailed/precise description of the problem, a minimum "working" example, and my attempts so far are at https://github.com/noinia/nodedemo . (it's a bit unweildy to describe the problem while flattening everything in one textual question; hence the ref. to a git repo that contains the proper file layout). Does ideas on how to proceed with this kind of thing?

I found two variables, modeline-mousable and modeline-mouseable-minor-mode. Also spelled mode-line-mousable and mode-line-mousable-minor-mode. The former configures the active frame/window, the latter the inactive.
 '(mode-line-mousable ((t (:foreground "cyan" :background "#007080"))))
 I find no documentation on them. 'Look up symbol in Info' fails. 'apropos' fails. Everywhere I searched, fail. 
 Obviously, they work. Every theme I examined that configures the modeline uses them to set the mouse behavior. But from where?
 edit Or, maybe, I've missed the boat and make-mode-line-mouse-map is the key. But what does it have to do with themes?

 ​
 It is my perception that programming parallel, asynchronous programs seems alot easier these days with all of these solution components working well together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using tab-bar-mode , and I would like to force each buffer to have it's own tab. When I close the buffer I would like to close the tab. (Excluding buffers that are not visiting files).
 At the moment I've bodged together a mix of functions to try to get this behaviour, and generally works, but not always (for instance when use org-refile to jump to a subheading in another file (which I do constantly)).
 I'm wondering if there might be a simpler way to achieve this behaviour? (Not a programmer, really struggle with this stuff). 
 Thanks in advance for all help, but: please don't just tell me I shouldn't be using tabs in the first place. I know many look down on tabs, and I have tried using buffers only for 2 years, and I hate it. I need some on-screen visual representation of the buffers I have open.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I wrote about a year ago that I am working on https://simplex.chat project, a small Haskell reddit group was exceptionally supportive - thank you all!
 I've spent a few weeks exploring which platform we should use to build our mobile apps - and Flutter/Dart with its unified compiled UI and a decent cross-platform seemed a strong contender. But having implemented the core transport protocol in dart, I do have some doubts...
 Having come through all the options, I've read that people use Swift across all platforms (iOS/Android/Mac/Windows) for applications logic, as Swift is an LLVM compiler, so it produces very fast binaries that run on Android without JVM.
 So, I am now thinking, wait a second - Haskell GHC is also an LLVM compiler. A short google search shows that people do compile Haskell code to both iOS and Android. And we already have most of the protocol logic implemented in Haskell - people use our SimpleX chat via terminal...
 While this all seems doable, the compiler configuration and low level bindings are a bit over my head - I am an application developer, so lots to learn here. Would anybody here who has the experience with Haskell on iOS / Android be interested to join the project (terms TBD) to at least help us set it all up, if not get involved longer term?

 I have a series of TODO tasks, and I want to set them to "DONE" in the order I do them. org-enforce-todo-dependencies is set to "t".
 I set the "ORDERED" property like this for a few lists: :PROPERTIES:
 :ORDERED: t :END: 
 This looks inelegant to me. 
 The manual gives this example for single line properties:
 #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4
 Can I do something like this:
 #+PROPERTY: ORDERED t
 I have tried it for a few lists of tasks, but I cannot get it to work. I don't know if that is because I am doing it wrong, or if it's not possible.
 Edit: the single lines for "PROPERTY" are supposed to start with a pound sign and a plus, but Reddit markup wants to display them as headers; I added a space and another pound sign. 
 The single line syntax is here

 Here's the problem:
 1) I'm running windows native build.
 2) I'd like it to run every hour without needing emacs to be open.
 Those two problems together put it way out of my knowledge area. I could probably figure out how to pipe the command to a text file, and I know I'll want to use Task Scheduler to do the update timing, but how do you tell emacs to spit out that much data without opening it? It seems like it's going to be difficult.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to build a fairly complicated scan operation (basically there's a stream of bytes and the scan needs to identify key values and form "sentences"). For code cleanliness reasons I'd like to put that in a transducer, but I don't see a relevant transducer method in https://javadoc.io/doc/dev.zio/zio-streams_2.12/latest/zio/stream/ZTransducer$.html. Fold is the closest thing, but to form sentences I need history. Is there a reason it's impossible to do as a Transducer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am working on setting up Emacs as essentially a Mariadb dev environment. I am wondering is any other SQL devs out there have figured out if/how emacs can export data from a SQL query output to a CSV. I have seen that Org-mode can do table exports, but it seems that it can only do that for exports made from Org tables and not database tables. (also, somewhat new to emacs and I have really messed with org-mode at all so I might be misunderstanding how all that works).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I have had a problem with emacs for a while (occurs in 25.3, 26.3 and 27.2 all the same) when trying to save files in certain folders on Windows. I get the following error message:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-number-of-arguments #f(compiled-function (ad--addoit-function filename &optional wildcards) #<bytecode 0x171e565>) 6) ad-Advice-copy-file(#<subr copy-file> "d:/Sync/testfile.txt" "c:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/backups/!drive_d!Sync!testfile.txt~" nil t t) apply(ad-Advice-copy-file #<subr copy-file> ("d:/Sync/testfile.txt" "c:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/backups/!drive_d!Sync!testfile.txt~" nil t t)) copy-file("d:/Sync/testfile.txt" "c:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/backups/!drive_d!Sync!testfile.txt~" nil t t) backup-buffer-copy("d:/Sync/testfile.txt" "c:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/backups/!drive_d!Sync!testfile.txt~" 438 ((acl .

 What exactly "certain folders" means I am not so sure about myself unfortunately. I can give a couple examples:
  
Standard Windows folders (e.g. "Program Files")
 Folders managed by the App "Sync" (syncs local files with cloud storage)
 The Goolge Drive App, which does basically the same, does NOT give me this issue UNLESS I share the folder in question with other users
 My work-pc is managed using Windows Intune, on this device a cannot save a file anywhere using emacs
  
I really hope someone has an idea, I am completely lost here. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I love Scala. It's the kind of love that every time I try to explore some new language, Scala comes in the way whispering "this language lacks this and that".
 I've tried Rust, Go, Kotlin, Clojure, and more. None of them is as awesome as Scala... And I'm good, really good actually.
 (Yet... What's with Travis Brown? Holy fuck, is this guy's purpose in life is to slowly suffocating the community?)
 Besides that... At some point it felt like it was evolving crazy fast. There was a new shiny amazing library to explore every month... And now there's just promises in the air and Scala 3 hasn't really taken off, and seems like it just won't.
 There's also the job offers. From what I've seen, only some companies in Europe are hiring (mainly in the Netherlands), and the positions they offer are that of a Senior Scala Engineer with no possibility of growing.
 Also, the speed in which the Scala ecosystem grew in the previous years left every company using Scala, having a mix of styles in their software. Some using Play, and then Akka, and then Http4s (with tagless final) and then ZIO and modern functional effects libraries.
 I feel like I fell in a pit of overspecialization and now I can't leave.

 But will scala-native be able to run without a mandatory GC since scala-library itself does not allocate and deallocate memory manually?
 If a GC is required then does that mean that the problem of "having a mandatory GC" & "GC pauses" (similar to JVM) also exists in scala-native unless there is a version of scala-library written in scala-native?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of recent, I have been getting this error:
 byte-code: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-file-name-concat 
 whenever I called org-roam's (org-roam-node-find) function.
 I was getting this error on a Linux machine (Arch) and on an Mac machine, both running Emacs 27.2. I tried installing v. 28, but the problem persisted.
 I then noticed that, if I loaded and evaluated the file org-compat.el (in org-mode's lisp directory), the problem didn't occur. The function referred to in the error message (org-file-name-concat) is defined in that file, and is conditional upon a specific version of Emacs.
 I discovered that the problem was caused by an incompatibility of sorts between the (old) version of org-mode installed with Emacs on my machines, and the (newest) version of org-roam installed by straight.
 Apparently, Emacs loads the old, default version of org-mode rather than the newer one installed later by straight (something which other users have noticed before).
 My fix consisted in deleting the old version from my machines.
 On Linux, I deleted the org directory on /usr/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/
 and on Mac, on /usr/local/Cellar/emacs-plus@27/27.2/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/
 I wanted to shared this information with other users who might be experiencing similar issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a transient.el menu with enough columns of shortcuts that the text starts to wrap at the right part of the screen when viewing on a smaller laptop display. Is there a best practice to modify the size of a transient's window? Ideally I'd like to remove the wrapping continuation lines of the transient's buffer, as the wrapping disrupts the layout of all the text. I'd also like to limit the transient window's height, though I've been playing around with transient-display-buffer-action without luck. If I could limit the window height and width, I'm guessing transient-scroll-up and transient-scroll-down would allow me to see whatever parts of the transient buffer are hidden by making the window smaller...
 The only working solution I've found is to use the predicate keywords (e.g., :if, :if-nil) to change up my transient's column arrangement depending on which computer I'm on, for example:
 (transient-define-prefix my-transient () ["MISC" [:if (lambda () (string= system-name "MY-LAPTOP")) ("R" "Avy Char in Line" avy-goto-char-in-line) ("P" "Pop Mark" avy-pop-mark) ("DEL" "Other Buffer" other-window)] ] ["Help" [:if (lambda () (string= system-name "MY-LAPTOP")) ("SPC" "Avy char" avy-goto-char)] ]) 
 But I would prefer the solutions in the first paragraph if possible. Thanks for any help!

In this first blog post of the series, I’ll be outlining a few
examples that showcase some limitations in GHC’s instance resolution
and type family reduction mechanisms. With a type-checker plugin, we
are no longer restricted by these limitations, and can decide ourselves
how to solve constraints and reduce type families.

Instance resolution
Recall how GHC goes about instance resolution, as per the user’s guide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started doing Project Euler problems a while back using Haskell exclusively, and so far the language has worked pretty well. In particular, the language facilitates writing code using reusable components (e.g. a lazy list of primes, a function to check whether a number is a palindrome), and also benefits from utility libraries (e.g. Control.Monad, Control.Arrow, Data.List, Data.List.Ordered) and from a few other conveniences (Integer type, ^ operator). 
 Those of you who have done Project Euler with Haskell and some other language(s):
 What other languages did you use?
 How did Haskell compare to the other languages that you used?
 Do you agree with my assessment of Haskell's strengths?
 Btw please refrain from sharing solutions to problems

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am pleased to announce that I have released Git-Modes on NonGNU Elpa as well as on Melpa. Git-Modes provides three simple major modes for editing Git configuration files.
 Previously these modes were available from Melpa as three separate packages named gitattributes-mode, gitconfig-mode and gitignore-mode. These packages have been removed and you should remove them locally too and then install git-modes, but make sure that it is already available before you do. That can take a few hours.
 The motivation for merging the packages into just one is that while many users may only regularly edit .git/config and maybe .gitignore, it is not such a bad thing if a major mode is ready to go when they first open .gitattributes.
 More in the announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem with Emacs and its modes is that you can not simply install something and click some minutes around to get an idea about if it could fit your needs or not. Some question comes up with all the (for me) known possibilities with ZK around emacs.
In the context of ZK I currently started using zetteldeft which is build on deft.
What is the difference between zetteldeft and deft - in description of feauters?


What is the difference between org-mode and org-roam?


Do I understand it correct that org-roam use sqllite database instead of plain text files? In that case it would be disqualified for ZK.


What is the diff between org-roam and zetteldeft?


Any other suggestions in the context of Emacs here?]]></summary>

 I haven't written any decent elisp code for ~3 years now and admittedly I have forgotten the little elisp knowledge I used to have. Upgrading doom-emacs has been a challenge for me as it'd be difficult to deal with possible breakage. (Also, sorry to admit that but I have also shifted some editor usage to neovim.) I am not able to properly maintain https://github.com/MaskRay/emacs-ccls anymore. There has been a few client-side issues I would probably never know how to address.
 Would it be a good idea to merge emacs-ccls into lsp-mode and take advantage of the large community? :) Apologies that I probably am not able to help much on the migration...
 If you are interested, please let me know. If you use emacs-ccls, please show your interest, it may help someone to get decided:)
 Feel free to rename functions or variables. I still know how to adapt my key bindings:)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Errata: This is a repost with a different title of a post I just deleted, since the old title "Is Haskell a better Python?" created substantial confusion, and Reddit does not allow the changing of post titles. The original post-thread can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/qbvfsh/beginning_programmer_here_is_haskell_a_better/
 ​
 I'm just a noob with a copy of "Haskell From The Very Beginning", but I'd like to ask:
 ​
 Is Haskell a better Python? As in, Python is a deliberate attempt to make a very accessible programming language, but guess what? The textbook I just bought has 127 functional pages (albeit extremely concise ones).
 ​
 I'm wondering if Haskell might be a better Python for people beginning to code; i.e, people complain about Monads this,
 https://preview.redd.it/kqvdmwedanu71.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=4165714f28e616ac30685a8095ca34fcb68427c1
 that, but a lot of it comes down to people starting with imperative paradigms.
 ​
 The benefits, likewise, are substantial. Haskell, in comparison in other programming languages, is very hard to make bad code in (because it simply won't compile). For non-programmers coming into programming, Haskell is a way to learn to code but also to produce a relatively high-quality of code, whereas Python etc might be easier to learn, but it's far easier to produce spaghetti code in other languages. Moreover, selling Haskell as "a better Python" to non-programmers also helps enlarge the Haskell community, leading to better library, compiler, and other forms of support, while making it so that many future programmers start from a functional paradigm instead of an imperative paradigm.
 ​
 Edit: I did contact Haskell Foundation about this subject, but I'd like to message them permission to post e-mail contents first, and I'd rather finish a few Haskell textbooks beforehand so I don't feel like a poser before I do so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love emacs zone, to fool out peoples. It feels i'm some kind of mythological creater or some hacker type. But,
 When enabling zone, it runs on different buffer removing current buffer code, It makes me very unintresting because i've tabs. 
 Here is my code without using zone
 https://preview.redd.it/bg9vezz4jmu71.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f27a94d010855b1fcb4207e14420db8a7d80907
 when not enabling zone, my tabs, (config.el, packages.el) remains same and i'm ok with that.
 ​
 ----- but when enabling zone this happens in tabs
 https://preview.redd.it/enzxyewajmu71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=923dbd01bb66a6674d23b2d54359f28a35e33cec
 It runs another buffer zone with other hidden buffer, and it looks so clutter and unromantic.
 ​
 Is there any way to use zone on the top of that code rather than opening to saperate buffer like in image 2, (with like that showing other tabs, than the tabs i'm running. I just want to on top of my code. 
 Thank you

 I have seen that there are packages that allow you to generate (say) desktop-notifications for scheduled todo-items and the like, but what is a bit unclear about these solutions is how to make sure that Emacs is in fact running when a notification is supposed to be generated?
 Do you have Emacs always running in server-mode or do you start Emacs in batch mode every now and then via a con-job or how is this done in practice?
 Many thanks.

I suspect that this key is set to something in the windows and stopping emacs from accessing it. Any idea what it can be. I have searched a lot but not able to find the solution yet.

 From the NEWS file for v27.1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I lately grokked that Haskell just reveals the very nature of imperative program, or sequential code, that a thread of execution (by machine, as well as reasoning by human), is essentially single item (thus monadic) data dependencies chained together.
 IO has a phantom (yet magical) RealWorld item in the chain (though only at type level, not present at value level), you can imagine every IO step receives a new version of the RealWorld from the previous step. While ST has an even more general abstraction of it.
 Human brains seem to take single threaded reasoning for granted, so procedural code would appear more "natural" to humans. But data dependency is inherently "multi-threaded", thus how referential transparency is more "natural" to the physical nature.
 We human perceive a single RealWorld despite multiple versions of it along the temporal axis. But thinking the data dependency way, no such single RealWorld actually exists at all, just as in Haskell (at value level).
 Then we have real difficulties in reasoning about effects (mutation done to the "world") applied, if not sequentially organized. How "unnatural" we human are. Anyhow, imperative programs reflect this bug/feature of our cognitive workings, including monadic Haskell.

 (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-tramp-connection "pyright") :major-modes '(python-mode) :remote? t :server-id 'pyright-remote))

 When a opening file on the remote, lsp-log shows "Command "pyright" is not present on the path.". 
 If I run which pyright in a terminal outside of emacs, that is ssh'd into the remote, it returns the path for pyright: /snap/bin/pyright However, running the same from eshell returns "no pyright in <path on my local machine>. So emacs seems to be searching for pyright on my machine, when it should be searching on the remote? I tried to add (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/snap/bin/") based on https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/Remote-programs.html , but same result.
 How do I make Tramp find pyright on the remote machine?

For those of you who only use timestamps and/or alphanumeric IDs, how the hell do you find stuff?
I'm guessing you perform keyword searches, and then follow the links embedded in the notes themselves? But, especially if you're using a timestamp, is there no way for you to simply scan through the file list and drop into a note that seems interesting based on the title?
Absolutely no judgment from my end. I'm genuinely curious who you approach your workflow, as I see a lot of diehard fans of the title-free approach, and just wondering how you navigate with it.
PS- In case you're wondering, I use alphanumeric/tree with a title attached:]]></summary>

  Since changing properties counts as modifying the buffer, it is not possible to remove a ‘read-only’ property unless you know the special trick: bind ‘inhibit-read-only’ to a non-‘nil’ value and then remove the property. 
 The secret is out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working with angles that get represented as follows: the hexadecimal representation of an angle is
 def formula(angle: Double) = Math.pow(2, 16) * angle / 360 // and then convert to byte array 
 Some examples:
  
30 degrees maps to 1555 (or Array(15, 55))
 -30 maps to AAEA (or Array(234, 170))
  
I can get it working fine for the first case:
 val transformedAngle = BigInt(Math.pow(2, 16) * angle / 360).toByteArray 
 That yields the expected result of Array(15, 55), but putting in 330 (complement of -30) yields Array(0, -22. -86) instead of Array(234, 170) which is not what I want at all. How do I fix this?
 ​
 EDIT: I ended up doing this super manually, using the knowledge that the result of the formula must be fit in two bytes (as it is 2^16 times a number less than or equal to 1). I set
 val second = formula(angle) % 256 val first = (formula(angle) - second) / 256 Array(first, second) 
 IDK why this had to be so manual, but it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[edit: reposted with more clarity
 Org-refile offers the option to refile either to the top level of a file, or underneath a heading in that file - is there an equivalent for this with linking? I'm looking to write a function that will return a hierarchical list of all open Org files as well as the headings inside of them, and allow me to insert a link to any one of them, without having to leave the current buffer to store a link, or enter the heading manually.
 You can kind of patch this together using counsel-org-goto-all, which provides an alist of all headings from all open Org files, with entries (HEADER . MARKER). Just write your own Ivy action that uses (concat "file:" (marker-buffer (cdr x)) "::*" (car x)) in order to build the destination of the link and pass it to org-insert-link, then call that action on a goto-all candidate.
 However, this feels pretty bootleg, and doesn't work when linking to files. I tried concatenating the results of calling counsel-outline-candidates and counsel-buffer-or-recentf-candidates, but this doesn't give a nice hierarchical structure, and you have to start doing a bunch of ugly conditional stuff to tell if you're dealing with a file or a heading inside the action. Is there a simple facility that Org or Ivy/Counsel provides in order to return a candidate list of open Org files and the headings in them, like Org-refile provides?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I generally don't use the mouse 'at all' in Emacs, and find that some buffers showing a highlight where the mouse pointer is to be very distracting. (Maybe a theme problem of coloration?)
 ex: In Selectrum/marginalia/orderless if I hit find-file and start typing something, and the filter list is say 10 items long.. if the mouse _happens_ to be in the bottom couple inches of screen, well, Selectrum will show a full width highlight on the row the mouse is on; which can mean that as you're typing, you're seeing two highglight lines - the one that is targetted by seledtrum if you hit (say) return, and the one the mouse is over. Its annoying since they colour the same (maybe fixable in theme, I'll check.) 
 Likewise, in buffer+ buffer listing, the mouse will highlight a row, as will the one I'm looking at with the keyboard.
 Changing themes (if a buffer supports a face for mouse at all) all over the place could be error prine and annoying.
 What I think I'm proposing is .. define (say) a minor mode that causes the mouse pointer to be ignored, hidden, or even blocked (don't let the mouse enter the confines of the window the mode is applied to?) ... then I could add some hooks on say prog-mode to add this minor mode (as well as minibuffer, say). It woudl be easy to selectably add this minor mode, thus leaving everythign else to work as normally.
 *shrug*
 Any ideas?

 Are there any Emacs Lisp packages like these which could display almost exactly what you would see in the minibuffer, but in an actual buffer as a major mode instead, along the lines of ibuffer but for listing arbitrary strings and not just listing buffers?
 I would like a tool that works in Emacs sort of like how you would use "dmenu" to make a menu from text taken from STDIN. But for my use case, I would like to take an arbitrary newline-separated list of strings and make an interactive menu out of it in a separate Emacs buffer. Also it would be nice to have the ability to re-order list elements, the ability to mark elements (like you would do with files in Dired), and the ability to copy the list of marked items to the kill ring or else insert the list of items as a string into some other buffer, the same way that pressing "Enter" in Dmenu will dump the selected items to STDOUT.
 So for example, I would maybe select a region of my text buffer, press my key chord to turn that text it into a menu buffer in a new window, filter/rearrange/select elements, then press Enter and replace the region from whence it came.
 Does anyone know of a major mode like this, or a way of configuring something like Vertico to work in the way I described? Or alternatively, is it possible to use something like ibuffer or list-buffers for displaying arbitrary lists of strings rather than just buffers?

This poses a problem: Reminding myself to read those citations.
I've attempted the following:
Add to my next actions list to add the citations to Zotero, then read them
Tag the items in Zotero that contain interesting citations
I'm kind of unsatisfied with these approaches. Not sure why. Could be a problem with my workflow or that the approaches themselves are inappropriate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming from Java world perhaps i'm not fully achieved yet the Scala mindset of solving some problems. I'm interested in building an Scala 3 extensible app, whose behavior could be extended, customized via plugins. Bonus points if those plugins could be loaded/unloaded on runtime and their clients be notified accordingly.
 Possible solutions I've thinking about so far:
  
Overriding DefaultPluginManager from https://pf4j.org/ so the class can be aware of sbt generated classes (may not work with bloop/metals generated random name directories). But have trouble with Akka classloader, so I 'm not sure if it'll ever would work.
 Use https://github.com/moditect/layrry which is based on Java Modules. Not tried yet. Sbt does not recognize module-info.java which is essential for it to work. Possible solution is implement an Sbt Plugin. But, I don't know if at the end this would work in development mode which is important.
 Mess with an OSGI runtime and spend 3 months figuring out how to make it work with Scala ecosystem.
 Implement the application around https://github.com/softwaremill/macwire and hope the wiredInModule feature (which support dynamic loading) would be ported to Scala 3 soon.
 Building a sort of dynamic bundler that compiles the application along with extensions using Scala 3's given/implicits feature. (although technically that would not be a plug-gable architecture)
 distage-extension-plugins looks very promising but it's no ported to Scala 3 yet.
 Using a DI framework like Airframe, but it doesn't support dynamic loading.
 Using Guice? :-(
  
Is there any more Scala principled way of achieving that? or another paradigm that helps building a dynamic app ecosystem through plugins/extensions in Scala? or another long-term software management strategy or architecture that could work?
 PD: The reason I really really need Scala 3 is because I want to make it around new ADT implementation and use type-class derivation from them.
 Thanks!

 Should I take that as a sign of inexperience with the language? Are there shops that prefer foldLeft as a matter of style? Or is this one of those weird situations where the interview distorts things because candidates assume interviewers don't want you to use "built in" functions? Are other companies demanding the use of foldLeft in interviews? Thanks for any insight that will help me judge fairly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OS: Arch linux with 5.14.11 kernel.
 I compiled emacs (using the AUR package) which is currently at version 29 but I installed and compiled it when it was still version 28. 
 emacs --version GNU Emacs 28.0.50 
 In my config I have the following snippet:
 (advice-add 'ido-find-file :after #'bhr/find-file-sudo) (defun bhr/find-file-sudo () "Find file as root if necessary." (unless (and buffer-file-name (file-writable-p buffer-file-name)) (find-alternate-file (concat "/sudo::" buffer-file-name)))) 
 When I visit a system owned file like /etc/pacman.conf 
 Previously I would be prompted for a password and after I entered it the file would be opened ion a buffer read/write. 
 It seems tramp behaviour has changed though. For quite a while now I see: 
 Autosave file on local temporary directory, do you want to continue? (y or n) 
 Typing y opens the file in as buffer read/write but without prompting for a password. 
 Typing n after the Autosave prompt leads to a weird situation
 I see a message - Unsafe autosave file name
 (Buffer is opened read-only)
 New tramp buffer appears with name "*tramp/sudo root@<host>" and the following contents:
 /root 
 Try to visit again and there's no prmopt and the buffer is opened read-only again. 
 Kill the tramp buffer. 
 I'm not sure why tramp behaviour changed but:
  
 How on earth does tramp open a file owned by root using sudo without prompting for a password? 
 Is it possible to have tramp prompt me for a password again the way it used to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys. Actually I was firstly going to learn scala 3 but I found that the documentation is in development and I currently might not be able to purchase a udemy/udacity/coursera/any other course, so hoping for financially free resources to help me learn. Hope you guys could relate. I want to ask, is scala 2 documentation enough to learn and clarify concepts of scala. I know a few other resources too such as, a geeksforgeeks tutorial, coursera's courses, devdocs.io, and a few other websites. I am learning C (mainly) [ik slow pace] since march I guess and python 3 also. I have basic knowledge of some data structures too. So, if I follow above resources and practice coding on my pc, would it be enough. Have any advice, sure. I'm happy for that. idk what else to say, so. [Edit: I think I am also comfortable at command line, I use GNU/Linux OS as my daily driver.] Thank you for giving me your precious time and help.

I use Alfred to create a timestamp for YYYY.mmdd.hhmm for everything on my hard drive and in Google Drive... It makes finding and drilling down things so much easier.
One can just type in 202109301009 and boom pdf or spreadsheet shows up in finder....it's like having an ISBN number for files. [I tend to use the format with periods.. e.g.  2021.0930.1009 since my brain reads this easier, and I can just type 2021.09 and find all files created in september of 2021]
If Gmail could do something like this automatic like The Archive, it would be so much better. 
Many Thanks,]]></summary>

 data Poly a = Poly [a] 
 and also a class:
 class Polynom p where substitute :: p a -> a -> a compose :: p a -> p a -> p a 
 I can make the datatype an instance of the class:
 instance Polynom Poly where substitute = ... compose = ... 
 I also want a Ratio of a Poly to be an instance of the same class; I have tried many syntaxes and language extensions, but none of them work; things like:
 instance Polynom (Ratio . Poly) where ... -- error: cannot use (.) there instance Poly p => Polynom (Ratio (p _)) where ... -- error: no wildcards allowed type X a = Ratio (Poly x) instance Polynom X where ... -- error: X needs another param instance Polynom (* -> Ratio (Poly *)) where ... -- error: wrong kind 
 My goal is to be able to have substitute and compose work on a Ratio (Poly *); for example:
 rf = Poly [1,2,3] % Poly [4,5,6] :: Ratio (Poly Int) result = substitute rf 10 :: Int 
 Is this even possible in Haskell? If so, what syntax or language extension am I missing here?

 I would like “most people” to not have to “know about” logicalBooleans. Instead I would like to accept a function of the form
 (OrderObject => Boolean) And then underneath the hood I transform this to an (OrderObject => LogicalBoolean) and pass that along to Squeryl.
 Is this something that can easily be done? I assume it mustn’t be otherwise it would just be in the Squeryl framework itself

 I'm trying to implement data schema validation through static type checking as explained in the following video between 5:23-8:46: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfaBeT0pRe0&t=323s
 The idea is that data schema is validated at runtime and the validations are represented as static types that can constrain the operations that can be performed on a given variable after it was validated.
 For example, let's take a machine learning dataset with tables, and a table named "emails" which has many fields, amongst these are: "personid", and "email". A query result can be checked whether the returned data matches a set of validators, and then the returned variable will have these verifications expressed as its static type.
 For example:
 data EmailsTableColumns = PersonId | EMail class Col a in…]]></summary>

 I am currently not using aeson-pretty myself, and this is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. Yet it has a good number of dependent projects, including a few high-profile ones. So it would be a shame to abandon it.
 If anyone from the community enjoys using aeson-pretty and would like to contribute/take over, I would love to hear from you.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't trust my hardware from my previous experience of losing files during tweaking around. So I decided to back everything up. Thats when i thought to keep everything in google drive.
 Pros:
 - Everything in online so you have no fear of losing them.
 - You can access them from anywhere without much configuration.
 - Its secured and scalable (gsuite is cheap)
 - Its available online all the time
 Cons:
 I have yet to face one.
 ​
 Configuration:
 - I used rclone to mount the google drive locally and then I can access it like regular directory structure. I did not face any noticeable slowdown during ivy-auto completion.
 - One issue you might face is - auto-saving. Slow-down occurs during auto-saving to remote storage so I just set a local directory as my auto-save destination.
 Here is a brief guide about my steps to set it up. (I am a newcomer so I would appreciate any suggestion.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/haskell,
 I am Shuai. I am from a group of researchers from Monash University in Australia who are interested in making visual tools to assist in teaching and learning the Haskell language. I created the Chameleon type debugger to help Haskell programmers better understand types and solve type errors. You can check out our talk and our paper at ICFP2021. 
 If you know Haskell (whether you are a beginner or a veteran), I want to invite you to participate in my online user study (code challenge). You can check out some features of the Chameleon debugger during the study. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 10 - 15 minutes to complete. But it will help us immensely. Click this link to proceed https://blend.ercu.be. 
 P.S. I know this is a form of self-advertisement after all. And therefore I have checked with the mods beforehand. To my surprise, they quite welcome my post here.
 Thank you,
 Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Lately I was wondering about the most efficient/canonical way of quickly doing one thing (yes, only one) following a coundition result.
 In elisp, we have two possible constructs for that (at least?): and and when/unless.
 For exemple, at the very beggining of my configuration file, I have currently the following line:
 (when (fboundp 'tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode 0)) 
 From a generic point of view, is there any more value to use and instead or not?
 (and (fboundp 'tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode 0)) 
 Because if when is just a macro or something like that around if, I wonder if it is more efficient to directly call and?
 Thank you very much for your insight.
