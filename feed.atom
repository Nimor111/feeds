        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using Slick for quite some time and I wanted to give doobie a try and the very first query that I wrote makes me think if the effort is worth it using doobie? For example.,
 sql"""select * from charging_location where location_id = $id""" 
 That sql selects based on a field and I will have hundreds of such CRUD operations and it makes it complicated to remember all the column names of the tables in my database. I would rather prefer to leave it to a mapper (like in Slick) and just use my case class fields for formulating a query. How do you guys out there using doobie think about it? I do not see any value in doing it like this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: I have a wc-mode/ dir under my .emacs.d, and I just want to add it to my .emacs.d repo. I staged it and committed but that didn't work. Pressing return on the dir in untracked files doesn't go into it (i thought maybe I could just add the files, but no joy). What gives?
 When I committed/pushed the wc-mode/ I staged I expected it to just add the subdir, but instead it went into creating a submodule (no experience with that term as far as VC goes) and added to the history that I merged a pull request from the git repo the dir originally came from (don't know where it grabed that info from). It was all very new, and pulling from my other machine just got me an empty dir. So I backed it all out manually by killing my .gitmodules file (newly created i think) and my .emacs.d/.git/modules/wc-mode (also newly created). Checked in the .gitmodules removal, but now looking for the way to just add a dir to my repo.
 I found a .git dir under wc-mode/ (don't think it was there before) and mv'd it to a bak. Now pressing return on wc-mode brings me up to .emacs.d in dired mode. Sooo confused now.
 (While I am curious about what how submodules work, and how it knew about the original github... I'd also really like to know just how to add a directory of files, since that seems very common.)
 ​
 Thanks for any and all help. I know this is a bit of a shit post from a debug perspective, but if you could point me toward the right info/book/etc that would be great. The magit info seems a bit obtuse at times, it's great for explaining low-level functions but not so much at explaining the designed workflow for things like this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to collect opinions from fellow Scala users.
 Given my experience in Scala it would be unfair not to provide my point of view so here it is:
 ​
 killer features:
 - domain modelling and processing: sealed hierarchies, type aliases, opaque types, pattern matching (Kotlin and especially Java falls behind)
 - contextual abstractions (unrivaled however there is little public knowledge on how to cook them properly)
 - DSLs (custom operators and occasional macro only, smart interpolation is landing in Java while Kotlin has functions with receiver type)
 - Innovations and other unique features (cool but hard to sell for commercial development)
 ​
 no-longer-killer features:
 - collections: Kotlin does it well, maybe even better (simpler hierarchy, faster, more helper methods on collections)
 - asynchronous/scalable code: project Loom does it better (however there are no established practices/usage patterns/libraries yet)
 - functional programming: practical parts have been absorbed by other languages, impractical are still plaguing Scala codebases.
 ​
 other stuff:
 - cats/ZIO/TF: imo requires too much effort with little gain unless writing complicated fiber interactions.
 - typeclasses: good for adapt-for-everything libraries, rarely seen in production code where abstracting over single specific type usually adds more complexity instead of reducing it.
 - HKT: GADTs? Never seen them in production code.
 - compile-time code generation: controversial. Can be enabler for unique code features (e.g. logging without org.slf4j.Logger instances or smart asserts) but is nightmare to develop, test and support. I'm quite sure everyone having macro-based RPC library silently wishes to rewrite it to plain old code generation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I learned about Scala around 2 years ago and started actively learning it 1 year ago. Reading books, watching talks from Daniel Spiewak, John De Goes, and Rock the JVM.
 In my current job, I write Golang and Typescript, both on a massive microservices architecture that serves 7-digit devices, and have around 2 years of experience. I know the typelevel stack and can write/read Scala without a problem. Played around with Spark, Actors, and Akka HTTP too, so I guess I can orient myself in the ecosystem on what does what. I also have a bachelor's degree in tech/design.
 I read here that you shouldn't learn Scala because finding a job is very unlikely in some countries. So I knew beforehand, anyways I started my job hunt in Belgium. It has to be a permanent job and not too far away (1 hour 20min drive will do) or fully remote.
 So far I have found 3 companies: one paused the hiring, the other one only had one backend developer with 2 years of experience, and the last one I received no email, but they did view my LinkedIn.
 Either I become a data engineer and maybe I'll have another 5 companies I can apply to and will probably get no answer since I don't have a relevant master's degree or relevant experience. Or I start doing something else.
 Scala made me a better developer and taught me a lot so no regrets there. But what's the next best step forward? Should I get a job in Java (never written Java before) which will in the future improve my chances of landing a Scala position? Or should I hop on the Golang hype train? Of course, this greatly depends on the country. Here in my country, it is mainly .NET, Java, and Typescript. 
 There surely have been others of you that experienced this, What did you do?

 I'm using emacs 29.1 with lsp-mode (20230907.220) and lsp-java (20230827.428) and working on a multi-module maven project.
 When lsp-java tries to start jdtls it gets so far, then I just get these messages repeated in the lsp-log and the server never actually starts.

 I've tried deleting workspace from the lsp-java folder but when I re-start and open a java source file it just goes back into this behaviour.
 Anyone seen this before or have any ideas how to fix?

I',m now moving away from Slick for one of my projects and using doobie and this hits me hard as the latest doobie version 1.0-RC4 depends on cats-effect 3 and Monix lacks support for it and I cannot proceed any further beyond compilation failure.
 The goal is for me to move away from Slick and use some other library. I considered doobie and it seems not a wise option as it causes compatibilities with Monix. Is there any other alternatives? I'm considering using quill. But it is unfortunate that there is no active development happening on Monix these days. It is such an awesome library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While changing my package manager to straight.el, I'm trimming my configuration down a bit and switching to a more citar based citation/bibliography management setup, and away from org-ref -- which is a fine package but maybe a little bloated.
 There are still some tools I'd like to use from org-ref, especially the ability to refer to org-src blocks and to LaTeX equations/environments via ref:. This is the use-package declaration I had in mind:
 (use-package org-ref :straight t :after (org) :config (require 'org-ref) ) 
 I'm new to straight.el though, so I think this might result in more features being built via the default recipe than I need. Is there a more precise recipe that will e.g. build only org-ref-core.el that will do what I need?

 In the sway configuration I export the browser variable:
 export BROWSER=firefox 
 I am trying to open the links from an emacsclient, but this also happens with a regular emacs session. The only way I can make it work, once it stops working, is to restart emacs. After I do that the links start triggering the browser again and everything works as intended.
 Could you please help me to debug this issue? I don't know how to proceed in this case, but I have found out that browse-url seems to be the resposible one. If I position the cursor on the URL and do M-x browse-url it does not work. Of course, after the emacs restart it starts working again. So, I think that this is the function that is failing.
 SOLVED: It is possible to add a handler and set the default browser with the browse-url-text-browser variable and then set the browse-url-browser-function as browse-url-firefox. This block of code solves my issue:
 (setq browse-url-text-browser "firefox") (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-firefox browse-url-new-window-flag t browse-url-firefox-new-window-is-tab t)

 And has anyone with a Mac upgraded to 29.1? If so, how?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, r/Emacs,
 I recently began working on a major mode for Microsoft PowerShell, and after many late nights of perusing documentation, reading through source code of other packages, and debugging, it has been accepted into MELPA. This was a great learning experience and really gave me a brand new appreciation for the customizability of Emacs. 
 This package currently includes the following features:
  
Detailed syntax highlighting (variables, cmdlets, keywords, .NET types, strings, single- and multi-line comments, docstrings)
 Code indentation 
 Auto-complete for built-in and user-defined variables and cmdlets, built-in cmdlet parameters, and .NET types and members
 Spawning and sending code to an inferior shell process
 Support for PowerShell in Windows, *nix, and MacOS
  
I kind of hacked together the company backend, so it may not be as efficient as it could be. There may also be some bugs I missed (I haven’t figured out how to do company completion for multiple periods yet for the .NET types, for example), but I have been using it for writing PowerShell scripts at work and it’s been working well. 
 Feedback is always appreciated and pull requests are always welcome. I hope you guys enjoy the package!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a weird problem that I've been poking through the code and cannot find an option of how to set this. So recently (and probably foolishly) I did list-packages and let it update everything. Doing this kind of broke doom-modeline for me. I was getting weird ISO characters in the modeline, and with some research discovered that it had switched to nerd-icons at some point in the past. Previously it was working fine with all-the-icons. 
 Well I got nerd-icons installed and that fixed things up pretty much though the character is still quite small in comparison. However I discovered that the little icon doom-modeline uses for VHDL files is different from the one treemacs and all-the-icons uses for VHDL files. So this got me looking around for some definition of what file suffix gets associated with what icon.
 And that's where I got stuck. I can't find any option or list anywhere that sets that up. It's not that I need them to be the same (though I do prefer the one in all-the-icons) but now I'm just puzzled as to how this is assigned. Clearly it's got to be in the elisp somewhere, but... nothing so far.
 Does anyone know where it lists a character hex value and a file type list?

 Today I am happy to announce that the first draft of the Cryptography Community Project Proposal has been finished, and it explains in much greater detail what this effort is about. Before I submit it officially, I would like to ask the community for feedback. Please, take some time to read it, and then leave any questions or concerns that you might wish to provide in a comment.
  
A lot has happened since we last posted about the  Botan Bindings Devlog here on reddit - if you've been following along on the discourse you may have already seen it.
 Here is the current state of the project:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, I do the following but wondering if there is a more efficient workflow. I use the full command names below to be clear but have key bindings for these. 
  
Open dired in the directory where I keep projects I'm working on.
 M-x magit-clone, select the [u]rl option and paste the SSH URL from the project (github say) repository and agree to the suggested local repository location
 Press n to the question: Set `remote.pushDefault' to"origin"? (y or n)
 Press M (for Remote) in the magit-status buffer for the local repository
 Press a (to add) and enter "fork" for the remote name. So "origin" refers to the upstream remote. This automatically presents the remote url as: git@github.com:fork/<project-name>.git. I don't like this.
 I move to the word fork in this URL and change it to my github username and then hit enter.
 Press y to the question: Set `remote.pushDefault' to"fork"? (y or n). This way I pull in from the upstream origin remote and push to my fork remote.
 Press b c to create a new branch etc. and begin my work
 
 What would be a more efficient workflow than this that would also avoid the incorrect URL in step 5 above? Thanks for your time.

 Regarding Scala 3 support, all modules in Pekko Connectors barring 2 have Scala 3 support with the exceptions being Pekko Connectors Slick and Pekko Connectors MongoDB due to underling libraries missing Scala 3 support. Scala 3 support in Persistence JDBC is also missing for same reason.
 When Slick 3.5.0 will be released with Scala 3 artifacts then Scala 3 support will be added and there are ideas to use ReactiveMongo for Pekko Connectors MongoDB which is currently working on Scala 3 support.

 I have a Haskell programming assignment due in a few days but I am stuck on the final component. The assignment is to render a variety of shapes through mouse and keyboard interaction in CodeWorld API. For example, one of the shapes is a "Line" which requires the user to draw a line in CodeWorld by "clicking" the screen to set the initial point and " releasing " the mouse to set the final point, and drawing a line between those 2 points.
 I have succeeded in rendering the shapes in CodeWorld, but the final element requires some more complex elements that I have no idea how to approach. The final functions require a user to press the arrow buttons on a keyboard to change the rotation and 'stretch' of a semiCircle and an ellipse. The rules are as following:

 Mermaid is huge and not every part of the grammar is supported. See the README for more information about what is and isn't supported.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love Emacs, and I want to use it for document editing and presentations. Recently, I stumbled upon the Emacs-reveal package, which offers a wealth of features that would greatly enhance my high school teaching materials.
 However, I've been facing quite a challenge over the past year and a half (on and off), trying to download and integrate it into my DOOM Emacs configuration. Despite my persistent efforts, I haven't been able to get it up and running successfully.
 I also know that DOOM Emacs has its own flavor of Reveal.js integration, but it doesn't have what I want. 
 Can someone help me incorporate this in my config? I would greatly appreciate any guidance or assistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using the %\N escape code in a capture template, is it possible to modify the value prior to having it inserted into the capture buffer?
 My use case is the creation of a headline where I prompt once for a person's name, but then insert it twice: once into the main headline text, and once as a tag. Something like this:
 ("m" "meeting" entry (file+olp "~/org/logbook.org" "MEETINGS") "* MEETING with %^{Person?}\t:%\\1:meeting:\n%?" ) 
 And that's fine if I respond to the "Person?" prompt with just the person's first name. So responding "John" gives me something like this:
 * MEETING with John :John:meeting: 
 The problem is, the person's name is usually two space-separated words, and spaces aren't allowed in tags. So if I respond to the "Person?" prompt with "John Smith", I get something like this:
 * MEETING with John :John Smith:meeting: 
 with the tags being broken.
 At the moment I have a kludgy workaround where I simply prompt for the name a second time, and I respond to that with a tag-acceptable version. Something like:
 ("m" "meeting" entry (file+olp "~/org/logbook.org" "MEETINGS") "* MEETING with %^{Person?}\t:%^{PersonAsTag?}:meeting:\n%?" ) 
 So when prompted for "PersonAsTag?" I'll respond with "john_smith" (but "JohnSmith" would work just as well) to get:
 * MEETING with John Smith :john_smith:meeting: 
 But it is, as I say, kludgy. So, is there any way to munge what I get from %\1 prior to it being dropped in as a tag?

The characters are displayed properly, but when I copy the same characters from MS Notepad and paste them to the same buffer, they are displayed as garbage. What could be the difference? And how to fix the problem?
 I believe that I'm using UTF-8 encoding in MS Notepad, and I'm trying to use UTF-8 encoding in the emacs buffer. (There are many UTF-8-* encodings, I tried many, none so far works.)
 It's even strange that the same content from the MS Notepad, if I save it to a file, then open by emacs, then the same content is displayed properly! It seems that the copy and paste might introduce some noise?
 EDIT: 
 My emacs/doom runs in WSL2 in Windows 11. This causes the problem. If I run emacs natively, copy from Notepad and paste to the natively running emacs, there is no problem.
 I even tried to 
  (set-next-selection-coding-system 'utf-16-le) (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-16-le) (set-clipboard-coding-system 'utf-16-le) 
 in emacs/WSL2, it still does not work.

 Using cc-mode I had defined a rather extensive custom style that I added using c-add-style. With treesitter I have not been able to find anything related. Not even anything relating to c-basic-offset and indent-tabs-mode. How can I control indentation and style when using treesitter?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's my yearly annual "Let's try Emacs and fail miserably and give up in 3 days" day! So I'm excited to announce that I once again have a newbie problem I can not solve!
 The problem is, as a pleb I want to use cua keybindings with ergoemacs. I know there is a built-in cua mode but I don't like it that much. So ergoemacs it is. I did install ergoemacs from the elpa package repository and tried to follow the directions they give but there are problems, the official site https://ergoemacs.github.io/ asks me to add:
 (package-initialize) (require 'ergoemacs-mode) 
 to my emacs init file. When I add those I get the error of:
 ⛔ Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/user/.emacs’:
 Wrong number of arguments: (3 . 4), 2
 To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace.
 Then I realised the line: (custom-set-variables '(package-selected-packages '(org ergoemacs-mode)) already exists so I didn't had to do anything about it, but then It wanted me to add:
 (setq ergoemacs-theme nil) ;; Uses Standard Ergoemacs keyboard theme (setq ergoemacs-keyboard-layout "us") ;; Assumes QWERTY keyboard layout (ergoemacs-mode 1) 
 Which I don't know where to add or how to add them. Can someone tell me, this worked perfectly when I last tried emacs.
 Answers such as "why not give emacs keybinding a chance?" or "why not use evil mode?" are prohibited since they literally are the opposite thing I'm asking here.

 Hello everyone, I am trying to use ox-publish to build a static blog and am seeking advise on my setup so far for my publishing script. The one on the left hand side is the one I will be using, the one on the right hand side was the one I used to test to make sure I had the syntax correct and everything working.
 So my question is about the directories, I have one project called pages and that's where everything for the website lives in directory format. Static is where my assets live like css style sheet and images. 
 0xblockz · main ⟩ tree
 .
 ├── assets
 │ ├── img
 │ │ ├── logo.png
 │ │ ├── mastodon.svg
 │ │ └── planetary_system_icon_125429.ico
 │ └── style.css
 ├── build-site.el
 ├── index.html
 ├── notes.org
 └── README.md
 ​
 this is the tree of the directory I am not a web developer so any advise would be greatly appreciated thanks

  (defun org-justify-fragment-overlay (beg end image imagetype) "Adjust the justification of a LaTeX fragment. Only equations at the beginning of a line are justified." (cond ;; Centered justification (= beg (line-beginning-position)) (let* ((img (create-image image 'imagemagick t)) (width (car (image-size img))) (offset (floor (- (/ (window-text-width) 2) (/ width 2))))) (overlay-put (ov-at) 'before-string (make-string offset ? ))))) ;; advise the function to a (advice-add 'org--format-latex-make-overlay :after 'org-justify-fragment-overlay) 
 The blog post was from many years ago, and it seems that some of the functions here, such as org--format-latex-make-overlay don't even exist in org-mode anymore. I tried searching through the org-mode source code and could not find any function with a similar signature as that of org-justify-fragment-overlay. Does anyone know of any potential fixes for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an active Emacs user and package developer, I've been contemplating the structure of tabulated-list-mode in Emacs Lisp, particularly its use of vectors. While vectors are efficient for indexed access, they present challenges when dealing with complex data structures or transformations.
 Much of my work involves parsing data from JSON API responses, which naturally form alist, plist, or hash-table structures. In the current iteration of tabulated-list-mode, a two-stage process is necessary: first, normalization into vector format (I find it hard to imagine a structure where the entry format (ID [DESC1 ... DESCN]) could originate from), followed by rendering through tabulated-list-print. This process can introduce performance inefficiencies.
 In real-world scenarios where normalization to the tabulated-list's vector format is unavoidable, the efficiency advantage of vectors is somewhat negated, and can even result in an overall performance loss due to the extra conversion step.
 I'd propose using lists instead of vectors in tabulated-list-format and tabulated-list-entries. This change could potentially allow for greater flexibility and better alignment with common data inputs. However, I understand that historical decisions and compatibility concerns may limit the feasibility of such changes.
 In the interim, I suggest enabling tabulated-list-print to act as a transducer, reducing the need for multiple iteration passes. This could significantly streamline the rendering of non-vector-compatible data while preserving compatibility and performance.
 I've noted that some libraries also struggle with this issue, resorting to workarounds and hacks, as evidenced in the magit-repolist-columns documentation string.
 I welcome your thoughts, advice, and any potential solutions or alternatives. If there are potential pitfalls I've overlooked, I'm keen to learn about them too.

 I have a windows 10 pc and I want to install Haskell on it, I tried looking up the internet but it was too confusing. I know ghci is a Haskell interpreter (or interactive Haskell program), ghc is the compiler and I have no clue what cabal is
 I would really appreciate it if someone would familiarize me with all the vocab/tools and recommend me how to install Haskell.
 I'm a python programmer and I use conda a lot, I looked up and found ghc available as a package on coda. I would prefer if I could install ghci and Haskell's package manager (if there is one? idk) through condaas well.
 any other advice is also appreciated

 Edit #1: After disabling company-mode in the completion buffer, the issue is gone, so company-mode is causing this issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have 2 files (that I've found so far) that are marked entirely as modified by git gutter, even though they haven't been modified. I can see in git that they haven't. 
 Does anyone know what might be causing this? They are both python files incase that helps. 
 Thanks :) 
 Here is my config (I've tried emacs with just this and it gives the same result). So i think it must either be a bug in git gutter or something odd with these files (line endings? im not really sure). If it would help to link the files somewhere I can try do that.
  (use-package git-gutter :ensure t :delight :hook ((prog-mode . git-gutter-mode) (org-mode . git-gutter-mode)) :config (setq git-gutter:update-interval 0.5)) 
 Edit: didn't solve this as such, but think somewhere i messed the file encodings up. decided to just copy the contents of the files into a new file and it fixed the issue. bit annoying but will do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it possible to set a random splash message from a list of provided messages in nano Emacs? Or does nano override all of them? I don't want to change the splash screen, just the message. For reference, I'm using Emacs-mac-port where the splash screen automatically disappear after 0.5 seconds. By default, nano splash screen show the message "GNU / N A N O" in bold with the message "Emacs made simple" in grey right below, I want to change the "Emacs made simple" line to a random message from a list of messages. 
 After screwing around in Emacs for hours on end with ChatGPT and the Internet it has been pretty fruitless (because it kept hallucinating nonexistent functions). I have tried some stuff such as initial-buffer-choice (turned out it randomize my scratch buffer's name in the modeline). There's this but it's only for images.
 Edit: I even tried this:
 (let ((inhibit-message t)) (message "Welcome to GNU Emacs / N Λ N O edition") (message (format "Initialization time: %s" (emacs-init-time)))) (require 'nano-splash) (require 'nano-help) 
 I tried removing the 'nano-help part because I didn't need to know initialization time. I tried removing 'nano-splash part then put the snippet above before the install nano line. Nothing works. It even broke the nano theme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am so shocked to find that author of "The Language Instrinct" take Emacs as his writing company.
 In chapter 7 of "talking head", Professor pinker introduced some AI chatting programming, he write it as:
 A version of the program was later sold as a computer game in Radio Shack stores, and another comes packaged with ~my word processing program, GNU Emacs~. (The documentation says, “If using Emacs becomes terribly frustrating and none of the techniques described above solve the problem, Emacs can still help you. Type ‘M-x doctor RET.' “) Here is a typical dialogue: User: I have been rather depressed lately. Computer: Are you depressed often? User: Yes, almost all the time. Computer: Why do you say yes almost all the time? User: Right now I feel like I could cry. Computer: Is it because right now you feel like you could cry that you came to me? 
 I read "The language Instinct" of Chinese translated version in 2016 before met Emacs 2 years later in 2018, so have no impression of Emacs in this great book.
 (P.S. "the language insticnt" was by the first time to be translated in Chinese and introducded to the masses in 2015 which is 21 years after Professor Pinker published it in 1994).
 I am very shocked, this book re-forged my mind afterwards. After its reading, I set off to throw away various tools of note-taking and mindmaps, then encountered Emacs 2 years later.

 Dear all,
 We have an opening for a student internship at NASA Ames Research Center, next Spring:
 https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000001OkSrEAK/onsite-virtual-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime
 The student, if selected, will be working on extending our capabilities to test cFS/ROS/FPrime applications, especially those using Ogma and/or Copilot for monitoring. Both Ogma and Copilot are open-source software written in Haskell.
 Applicants for this internship must be U.S. Citizens and meet a minimum 3.0 GPA requirement. Prior experience is not required. Knowledge of the following will be considered a plus: Haskell or other functional languages, C/C++, Bash, git, Docker, Linux, NASA Core Flight System, Robot Operating System, FPrime. Please note that the academic level listed in the opening is merely indicative and students at other levels (e.g., PhD) will also be considered.
 For further details, or if you have any questions, see intern.nasa.gov and the specific listing at https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000001OkSrEAK/onsite-virtual-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime.
 Even though the deadline for applications is Aug 31, it will remain open for a few more days.
 I will be at ICFP during Mon 4 Sep - Sat 9 Sep. Find me there if you would like to discuss.

 After i started coding with lsp-mode (rust-analyzer as server) and company on, i realize that auto complete in company won't insert () for functions automatically.
 I know this may be a duplicated question but i still cannot find the solution.
  
And also how can i make YASnippet work with lsp-mode? Like showing both lsp and YASnippet completions in company menu.
 I tried copying Doom Emacs' hook but not working.

I'm particularly interested in integration tests, as it's harder to spot unintended interactions between the many functions that make up the algorithm than it is to spot bugs in a single function in isolation.
 I'm familiar with the QuickCheck paper, and I typically test functions by randomly generating test cases and, where possible, testing properties. The constraints that my rebalancer enforces define a set of properties that are easy to test, but they are not sufficient to guarantee optimality. It seems that the only general way to test for optimality would be to compare the output of my rebalancer to the output of an alternative rebalancer that tries to s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a few different use cases for org mode that have a common feature: A template that is repeated in a file. For a fictional example:
 ``` * Beer Template - Country :: - Aroma :: - Taste :: 
  
Carlsburg
  
Country :: Denmark
 Aroma :: Citrus
 Taste :: Slightly bitter
 
 
Weihenstephan 
  
Country :: Germany
 Aroma :: Grains
 Taste :: Sweet wheat ```
 
  
I have tens of different files with these "templates". A common problem that I have is that I need to add or change a field in the template. For now, I'm using clever VIM searches and macros to manage the templates. Is there a better way, preferably using an Emacs or org-mode feature?
 In some cases where the field content is short, I've gotten away with using a table. But that is the exceptional case, usually the field content is too long to make a table useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been messing around with writing some functions for switching fonts on-the-fly. This approach works for every font I've tried except for Inconsolata, which indicates that it probably has something to do with that font, but I figured I would ask this here in case anyone has seen something like this before. I wouldn't be surprised if the code I wrote is just bad somehow too... 
 What I'm doing: evaluate the following elisp, then with M-: run one of the functions like (rex/frame-init-ibm). This causes the faces in the list in rex/frame-init-aux to be applied to this and every subsequent frame. When I run (rex/frame-init-inconsolata), the frame uses some kind of serif variable-pitch font from my system as if it can't find the Inconsolata font (without throwing any errors) unless I run …]]></summary>

I love the shear custom ability of Emacs and love the how it seamlessly integrates code and notes. I love literate programming and being able to tangle documents from org-mode so that my notes become the function code. I love the versatility of Emacs to literally do anything. I love org-agenda and I love tools like magit.
 I dislike the amount of time that I seem to need to delicate to ensuring Emacs is constantly functioning properly. I really struggle sometimes to fix and issue. For example: Org-ref recently stopped working, it took a week for me to solve the problem and I am still not sure how I solved it. I also feel lik…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do any of you capture interesting current events in your zettelkastens?
There are a few topics that interest me. For example, in my job, I like to keep on top of certain technology trends and it's useful to me to track them. The stories I find might be slight, but I'm more interested in a larger pattern that they represent. The pattern may or may not be obvious at first, or it may end up going in a different direction than what I expected, or it may end up being noise.
My idea is that I would create a note documenting what interests me about the story and have a structure note representing the broader trend, but curious if others have thoughts on the merits and demerits of this kind of approach within a zettelkasten framework.
The concern I have is that I will fall prey to the collector's fallacy, and end up with a bunch of notes that are little more than "So this happened."]]></summary>

 I also use baseline spacemacs and evil-mode, specifically gh, gj, gk, gl to move around and in Vim there's "] z" to go to the bottom of the fold, but on evil mode it only shows "] z is undefined". Is there a plugin I'm could use or some org command to I could bind using evil-mode.

 With compiled Heist it seems like there's a rather narrow happy path that you are supposed to take: have an application monad and access that from within your (runtime) splices to fetch data from the database.
 There is a Stack Overflow answer that hints at the possibility to also get data into compiled splices outside of a monad but the Heist documentation for initHeist says:
  
We don't provide functions to add either type of loadtime splices to your HeistState after initHeist because it doesn't make any sense unless you re-initialize all templates with…]]></summary>

 But in emacs evil mode when I try to bind C-c to the same functionality it works in some places But when modes like haskell-mode is turned on it just starts to wait for a keychord I was wondering is there a way to work around that
 I had an idea of maybe introducing a state like emacs state Suppose I am in evil state and everything is working like vim I mean all the motions and then I press say “C-z” which toggles evil mode Now I am in emacs state and all the emacs key-chords start working
 Is there a way that I can achieve that?

 EDIT: OK, found the solution. An update in the doom-modeline breaks the `all-the-icons` package, so you have to use `nerd-icons` and its respective install fonts command.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question about setting/modifying the modifier keys on my MacBook.
 I'm using Emacs from Homebrew (29.1), and I had the following in my old configuration file:
 (setq mac-option-modifier '(:function alt :mouse alt) mac-right-command-modifier 'super mac-right-option-modifier 'hyper ns-alternate-modifier 'super ns-command-modifier 'meta ns-pop-up-frames nil) 
 This was cargo-cult stuff, though, cribbed from someone else's config (whom I can't remember). I tried to shrink it down to just this:
 (setq mac-option-modifier 'super mac-right-option-modifier 'hyper) 
 Because I really just need the super keysym working. But it doesn't-- I keep getting the alt keysym (doing a C-h k and using the key gives me something like "A-q", for example).
 Is there a good resource for these variables?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On behalf of maintainers I'm happy to announce tasty-1.5 RC1. Here is the changelog:
  
Progress reporting is no longer ignored. PrintTest constructor of TestOutput now has an extra field used to report progress. Supply const (pure ()) as this extra field value if you want to skip progress reporting (#311).
 foldGroup now takes [b] instead of b as its last argument to allow for custom fold strategies. This is a backwards incompatible change, but you can get the old behavior by applying mconcat (#364).
 Dependency loop error now lists all test cases that formed a cycle (#340).
 Dependencies can now be defined pattern-free with sequentialTestGroup (#343).
 Added --min-duration-to-report flag that specifies the time a test must take before tasty outputs timing information (#341).
 When a test failed with an exception, print it using displayException instead of show (#330).
 The -p/--pattern option can be specified multiple times; only tests that match all patterns are run (#380).
 Fix color scheme to make info messages visible in terminals with white background (#369).
 When parsing of a command-line option failed, report received option (#368).
 Support WASM (#365).
  
You can give it a try using the following cabal.project:

 Haskell excels because it's truly an amazing language.
 ML has become interesting because it crossed this viability threshold in the last year where it unlocks many new exciting use cases.
 I've long considered that Haskell is the best lang+ecosystem in every way, except it doesn't have as much community momentum as python/JS, eg not as many libraries, not as much adoption.
 ML Benefits:
  
ML makes bridging that gap significantly easier; it's significantly easier to write and translate new libraries into Haskell
 
It makes onboarding new people to the community easier by helping them write code before they necessarily grasp all the language's nuances (yes this is a two-edged sword).

 I have following problem - there is some internal logic in emacs on when to split the window and when to reuse one of the windows when I, for example, commit via magit or use rgrep. On my laptop for example it is 2 and on my wide screen it is 4.
 The problem is that if I split wide screen into 4 it is too narrow for me. Can I limit number of windows so it stays 2 as on laptop? I found function to query this value but not to set it.

An opportunity that I couldn’t pass up by David Thrane Christiansen
A rare opportunity came by, and I will be returning to a full-time developer role at the beginning of October. Based on the hard work of our volunteers, the board, and our collaborators, the Haskell Foundation has become a key part of the community’s infrastructure. This will not stop - we’ve arranged for project work to continue after my last day, and the next ED will take over an organization in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have experience in writing some very simple games in a functional language. I tried it and failed miserably. My approach was really bad. I tried to do an OO approach and everything got tangled in IORefs, IOs and a billion functions that do a lot of stuff and are difficult to refactor. 
 I would like to know if someone has tried this before and how they went about it. Let's say you have this very simple game, at the start you can choose how many players can play, they choose their name, the deck is shuffled, the players are put in a circular queue and the game begins. To play, simply write the card you want taken out of the pool in the order chosen. The game loop ends when no cards are left in the pool. How would you design something like this? How would you add on top? Is it possible to use an OO approach, where different "objects" can communicate with each other, or is another pattern better? 
 Thanks!

 as I work on a couple of c/c++ projects I configured lsp and ccls. whilst they seem to work, it is not working as intended (for me).
 I have a project, let's name it project1. the root directory of project1 has a CMakeLists.txt file, another folder named "Arduino" with all Arduino libraries and a folder called "app" which includes my custom code.
 ​
 When I navigate to /project1/app and click on a .cpp file. ccls sets that as the root folder. the issue here is that definitions are not all being processes meaning if I would input a .h file not in /app I am not able to go to its definition or get any syntax help..
 ​
 I have tried to add a .ccls-root and .ccls file in /project1 but ccls seems to ignore this and creates a .ccls-cache always in /project1/app once I hopen a .cpp file in app.
 ​
 Does anyone know how to solve this or is this intended this way? I am also using projectile and treemacs! I appreciate all the help!
 here is part of my config regarding lsp and ccls
 ​
 ​
 (defun efs/lsp-mode-setup ()
 (setq lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-segments '(path-up-to-project file symbols))
 (lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-mode))

 Currently it seems that when I have tasks with sub-tasks and sub-sub-tasks each task-with-a-child is classed as project, even if they are part of a "parent" task. 
 In the example below, Project 1 and Task 1.1 both have children, but I want to only count Project 1 as the project (i.e. it's the parent) as well as Project 2. 
 * TODO Project 1 ** TODO Task 1.1 *** TODO Task 1.1.1 ** TODO Task 1.2 * TODO Project 2 ** TODO Task 2.1 * TODO Task 3 
 However, if I run the sample code Task 1.1 is included.
 (let ((org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Projects" :children t) (:discard (:anything t))))) (org-todo-list)) 
 What I'm looking for is something similar to Bernt Hansen's project definition. I'm happy to keep using that if org-super-agenda doesn't do this...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched to org-preview-latex-default-process=dvisvgm and am really liking the nice vector rendering SVG provides. Given that SVG can be quickly displayed at any scale, I stick the following in my org-mode config. It rescales all latex preview fragments correctly with the text size as you zoom text. Works pretty much instantly, since no image regeneration is required.
 Looking forward to Org 9.7 and super fast preview rendering. Thanks to the org devs!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am taking mathematical notes using org mode and would like to have inline previews for commutative diagrams. For mathematical equations previews works perfectly with dvipng, but since dvipng doesn't play well with tikz-cd based commutative diagrams I changed to using imagemagick by setting org-preview-latex-default-process. However, when using imagemagick my latex previews (equations, diagrams etc) come out huge -- the text itself is appropriately sized, but the "frame" of the image is huge. See the below for examples:
 With Imagemagick: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SWS65.png
 With Dvipng: https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRkTV.png
 As you can see, in the first example the image is so large the lorem ipsum paragraph isn't even in view.
 How can I fix this? I would really like to use imagemagick for commutative diagrams, but having such huge images is unwieldy.

I posted this a while back but didn't get a response. Really sorry for posting again, but I'm still struggling with it!!! Thanks in advance for any thoughts.
When I use this function, The Archive copies the title of the note and the identifier, and pastes them like this:
[[201930091959 Alexander Gordon]]
It was my understanding, from reading the forum and blog posts over the years, that best practice was NOT to include the title of the note in any link, as the title may well change in the future and rather to link using the unique ID. So, I do this, with only the ID actually linking:
[Alexander Gordon][[201930091959]]
Any thoughts? Why does The Archive include the title when generating the link?
Cheers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a pretty basic setup for writing org files with jupyter and converting that to an ipynb with pandoc. The problem I'm running into though is that the code blocks never recognize the conda environment. Below is my workflow for it and the error.
 ​
 This basically sets up my session and activates my conda environment, which is confirmed by the second command. This seems to work just fine.
 ```
 +BEGIN_SRC shell :session qiskit :results output
 conda activate tutorials
 echo $CONDA_PROMPT_MODIFIER
 +END_SRC
 ```
 Then I run some basic code and it fails at the imports with No module named 'jsonpickle'
 ```
 +BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session qiskit :results output :exports both
 import time import warnings from pathlib import Path
 import jsonpickle import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 import numpy as np from scipy import interpolate
 +END_SRC
 ```
 So I added in another block to check that it was installed with
 ```
 +BEGIN_SRC shell :session qiskit :results output
 pip3 freeze | grep pickle
 +END_SRC
 ```
 When running that it shows I have jsonpickle installed. On top of that, even outside of the conda environment I have jsonpickle installed, so if it wasn't recognizing the environment and went without one then I don't know how that error would appear. Taking the same code and putting it in a python file and running that works just fine.

  f :: List InputType -> List OutputType f mylist = case mylist of (x:xs) -> dothingsto x : f xs 
 I'm still learning PureScript, and I'm struggling to do that with Arrays or Strings. As far as I understand, I can't pattern match on arrays in a [x:xs] kind of way, as xs in this case will only match the complete rest of the array exactly.
 For Strings, at least Data.String has no cons. Of course I could List.fromFoldable <<< String.split (Pattern "") to get a List or similarly create a listf of Chars, but being able to do that without would be much cleaner. I'm sure I just don't know enough yet :D
 Also, Pursuit is quite a rabbit hole if one searches type signatures...

 I am using Plasma5. Recently I have a new installation of Emacs, but there is some very confusing behavior.
 Whenever I press M-x, the bottom end of the window moves up a bit (and the rest of the window doesn't change), and when I type a command and press Enter, the bottom end of the window moves up as well. The same thing happens when I use shortcuts like C-x v, etc. When I use it normally for a while, the window is almost down to the top half of the screen.
 I don't know if this is a bug in Emacs or some other program and don't know how to search for this problem, does anyone have any clue?
 Please let me know if I should provide more information.

 im relatively new to doom emacs, been a month using it.
 for my note taking in class, i am trying to use org mode and add images to the text file. 
 the org-download package solves my problem, but i am unable to install it since i dont know what to do on the github page. 
 i dont know where to paste the code/what to do. 
 https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download
 I have however, been responsible and tried to trouble shoot the problem by: 
 ​
 - installing the org download package from package list
 - messing around with the config.el file 
 - researched about melpa
 ​
 despite being a beginner, could someone help me out to get it up and running
 ​
 warm regards, 
 Aryan
 ​
 ​
 despite this, nothing really works - i dont think its supposed to, since the github page had more instructions.
 no clue what to do

 I'm configuring my Emacs config again, and I'm wondering:
 - What is everyone's favorite file manager in Emacs to quickly rip through a given project directory to access it on the fly?
 Is there anything that would allow it so that the directory could be displayed in the middle portion of the screen as an overlay and would allow you to type a few characters to quickly rip through a project to find the given file you're looking for?
 ​
 I'm basically looking for the 'ripgrep' equivalent of a file manager. I've used Dired through and through, and want a faster workflow for modern web dev projects.
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I use org-roam and regularly use org-attach to add clippings or even as a save location for babel file outputs (e.g., generating a diagram or figure).
 I'm also a bit naughty, and don't always keep my files entirely atomic. Such that I quite often will retrospectively org-store-link on a heading, assigning it a new ID. But when I do this, any attachments in that section now break, as the results of (org-attach-dir) now are generated from the new ID, not the file-level one. I also generally like the idea of having a single (org-attach-dir) per file; but also to have that (org-attach-dir) be based on the file ID. 
 Is there a way to have (org-attach-dir) use the root/file-level ID for generating its file path? 
 Thank you very much for any advice.
 ​
 Notes:
 I've looked through the archives, with some related posts found but which don't quite match my needs.
  
Question on setting up org-attach folder per file. :: I'd still like to automatically generate from ID
 How to enable org-mode to search attachment in parent header's attachment folder :: this seems to be my question! But there wasn't any satisfactory answer at the time. tag u/shelper9527 
  
I've tried to set the DIR property to the value of (org-attach-dir) at the root, but I don't think its possible to dynamically set properties like this? This would be ideal, as I could do this only for new files, so not breaking files that already exploit inherited IDs.
 I've tried looking into the org-attach-use-inheritance, but it seems its not designed to enforce only using the root property.
 I suppose there is some advice-add magic that could be done to (org-attach-dir)? This would be satisfactory, but less preferred as I don't like over-coupling my org notes to my specific emacs dotfiles.

 I have been making a sound synthesis library which I want to share:
 https://github.com/Simre1/lambdasound 
 Compared to others of its kind, it's more low-level and simpler. You can work directly with audio samples while having some combinators for more complex work. 
 Here's an example:
 main :: IO () main = play 44100 0.5 $ let upwards = sequentially $ note <$> [c4, d4, e4, f4, g4] backwards = reverseSound upwards triad = setDuration quarterNote $ parallel $ note <$> [c3,e3,g3] pause = setDuration quarterNote silence in parallel [ upwards >>> dropSound halfNote backwards, repeatSound 5 $ sequentially [triad, pause, pause, triad] ] where note semitone = easeInOut 3 $ setDuration halfNote (asNote harmonic semitone) 
 If there's interest, I can put up the package on Hackage.

 unordered :: Generic a => Parser a unordered = to <$> unordered' 
 where the fields of a do not have specified order in the stream.
 I have created the classes
 class Unordered f where unorderd' :: Parser (f p) class ParseByType a where parseByType :: Parser a 
 with the instances
 instance Unordered (D1 c (C1 c' s)) where unordered' = M1 . M1 <$> unordered' @s instance Unordered (a :*: b) where unordered' = ??????????????? instance Unordered (S1 c (Rec0 a)) where unordered' = M1 <$> parseByType @a 
 I do not know how to write instance Unordered (a :*: b) for example type (Int, Double, Bool) that will allow out of order parsing of the Int, Double, and Bool. For example:
 runParser unorderd "True\n1.0\n5\n"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What:
  
I'm using MSYS2 MINGW64 and used used pacman to get: 
 mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-emacs 28.2-4
 This version hangs when i invoke package-list-packages 
 I have to kill the process from another mingw64 window
 
 
 I uninstalled that version of emacs and then used pacman to get: 
 msys/emacs 27.2-1 <--- note that this sits in the msys space and not the mingw64 space; and for some reason only works in CLI mode (as if invoked with the -nw option)
 This version does not hang when invoking package-list-packages
 
  
Why: 
  
I'm stuck on windows with absolutely no admin privileges and there are various tools that are so far only for linux and a few only for emacs.
 While I do like the CLI version of emacs I sure would like to use the GUI version. 
 some of the packages will only work in GUI mode... at least i'm pretty sure.
 
 I could use a VM. That is my backup plan. But I'm hoping to avoid that.
  
My troubleshooting so far: 
  
using the built in debugger: 
 setting the debugger to trigger with (package-list-packages) via M-x debug-on-entry only results in an immediate lockup
 
 eww on MINGW64 also hangs in MINGW64 but not in the MSYS version. 
 No eww isn't one of those tools I need, I'm just using it for troubleshooting purposes.
 
 I don't have access to the firewall logs of the host (windows 10). I also can't turn it off.
 emacs messages buffer doesn't provide anything.
 google searches haven't yielded anything useful (that I can understand)
  
How:
  
i dunno.
  
Who:
  
Probably a user error or oversight on my part.
  
I think that's it. I appreciate if anyone read this far. I'm open to suggestions but understand if this is one of those mysteries that will never be solved.
 Thanks in advance and have a great day.

 It is not a new post, but I received today an email from GitHub which caught me off-guard, stating that my account would require 2FA from now on. And I really hate to tie any workflow of mine to the phone. I recalled having read something about it, and some searching brought me back to Mickey's post. Jackpot! Emacs to the rescue, with Mickey's help.
 I ended up doing things a little differently, since my setup is not the same. I store my passwords in a .gpg file, and wanted to retrieve the totp key from there, instead of from auth sources. And I also preferred to use oathtool for the main task, instead of the adapted version of Jürgen Hötzel's `totp.el'. Which, as a bonus, spared me of handling the base32 decoding.
 But Mickey's post was really useful in showing an alternative and laying the ground work. You may find it useful too, since you are likely to have received or to soon receive the same GitHub message (if you didn't already had 2FA set up).

 I hope you are doing well and good, so recently I decided to use the Xmonad window manager. I did so using GHCup and via cabal-install. I said yes to all the options afterwards so installed stack as well as Haskell language server. 
 However I now actually want to learn the language, There is so much stuff online however that it's now confusing me. 
 Can someone please guide me, help me build a small road map perhaps as to how to begin. Also I am confused because someone's using stack , someones using cabal and people suggesting stack but others saying stack is used for big projects ....I am lost guys, any help would be appreciated. 
 Thank you so much,
 Best Wishes.

 It is about the known shortcuts like: Ctrl+C = copy, Ctrl+S = save, Ctrl+Z = undo, Ctrl+Q = quit, and 30 more of these.
 It is a work in progress (it is working well but has still has lots of ToDo's), but I would love to get some feedback about it. (and if the feedback is: "completly unnassasary, becase there is something better", that is okay as well)
 I like how I combined Ctrl-c for coping in transient-mark-mode with Ctrl-c keping it's original functionality when nothing is selected. (At least I like the way it works, the elisp-code was just the best I could do).

 Emacs 29's alpha-background frame parameter provides some more options to do this, and I was wondering if anyone had other suggestions. One complication is that most people use a white background for their slides, but Zoom will also letterbox or pillarbox it into something with a black background.
 The best thing I've found so far is to set some theme with a black background and white text (I'm open to suggestion on themes for this purpose) and then
 (set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha-background 20) (set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha 60) 
 This seems to have some balance between being able to see the Emacs frame at all and the Emacs frame not obstructing a text-heavy presentation. But if anyone else has tried something else that works, I would love suggestions!

 However, the professor added a Tests.hs file that imports Test.HUnit so we can run and confirm the functions we implemented are correct, at least in a simple form.
 The issue is I’m lost on how to actually run the tests. “ghci :l Tests.hs” gives an import error for Test.HUnit. When looking up the package it mentions “runTestTT” but that just says there is no variable call that so I’m sure I’m running it incorrectly.
 There is also a cabal file that lists HUnit as a dependency. 
 How do I go about getting HUnit working? Thanks for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi friends, I do hope my message finds you all well. I recently started learning emacs (with doom emacs) and I'm pretty happy with my setup right now. However, my current daily driver is a low-end laptop, and I wonder what's the best practice to start emacs so it won't load a ton of packages to just edit a 1-2 files. I built emacs29 from source, with native compilation, I'm also lazy loading most of my packages, which are just a few, but I wonder if running `emacs` instead of `emacs -nw` or `emacsclient` , might be affecting my starting up time and cpu/mem consumption. 
 The later implies that I should start the `emacs daemon` on startup? What's the difference between the options I mentioned above? I would appreaciate any suggestion. Thank you in advance!

I'm writing about the development of the reading brain from an anthropological-neuro-development angle. I am also outlining a historical fictional idea centered on the idea of reading's escape from something only the privileged classes knew about, which occurred in Catholic monasteries in the 1200s.

Creating a quick Backlink and Idea Graph demo for the ZK forums. I've been using this for a while. It answers the questions/complaints that The Archive doesn't automatically create backlinks or an idea graph.

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread.
Things I'm reading:
Blum, Andrew. The weather machine: a journey inside the forecast. 2019.
Solomon, Sheldon and Greenberg, Jeff and Pyszczynski, Thomas A.. The worm at the core: on the role of death in life. 2015.
Wright, Dale Stuart. Philosophical meditations on Zen Buddhism. 1998.
Donald, Merlin. A mind so rare: the evolution of human consciousness. 2002.
Illich, Ivan. In the vineyard of the text: a commentary to Hugh's Didascalicon. 1993.
Programming  work/fun:
I'm refining my Vocabulary Builder, which uses Keyboard Maestro/OpenAI ChatGPT
Things I'm writing about:
I'm writing about the development of the reading brain from an anthropological-neuro-development angle. I am also outlining a historical fictional idea centered on the idea of reading's escape from something only the privileged classes knew about, which occurred in Catholic monasteries in the 1200s. It is hard to grasp that before the 1200s, hardly anybody read, whereas now almost everybody reads.
How to develop the skill of conversationalism.
Music I'm listening to:
Ancient Future
SUSS
Hermanos Gutiérrez
Ideas I'm thinking about:
Creating a quick Backlink and Idea Graph demo for the ZK forums. I've been using this for a while. It answers the questions/complaints that The Archive doesn't automatically create backlinks or an idea graph.
The weather.
The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many tasks are -- or at least, eventually end up being -- multi-"visit" affairs. In other words, the work may end up being done as several sessions in a single day, or even across multiple days. Either way, it can be useful to log what was done at each "visit". I've tried a couple of methods, in particular with a view to being able to produce some kind of time-filtered status report, perhaps via a clock table (cf. this question) :
  
Use org-add-note (C-c C-z) to add a timestamped note to the task, in the same way that state change notes get added. That's nice and quick in terms of adding the info, but I've never been able to find a way of getting that into any kind of time-filtered report, 
 Create a sub-headline for each "visit" -- usually using org-capture with a C-0 prefix. I'll clock into and then out of that and that means a clock table can pick up the sub-headline to use as my note of progress for that visit. It's tolerable, but it still restricts that progress note to just a headline, and I 'll often want to say more than that. 
  
How do others log progress in tasks? Do many use org-add-note?

 org-timeblock: Multi-day views
 org-timeblock is a new Emacs package that allows you to view and manage your orgmode tasks/events using timeblocking technique, which is implemented in almost all modern calendars.
 org-timeblock is interactive: you can navigate between blocks via mouse or arrow buttons; and then reschedule them or change TODO state. 
 Here's a quick video demonstration: org-timeblock: Multi-day views

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently installed emacs 29.1 in fedora 38 using snap. Specifically using that link https://snapcraft.io/install/emacs/fedora 
 But emacs has this "twitchy" behavior where it goes "back" for a brief moment and returns to the current "state". Let me give me example to illustrate the behavior better: Suppose I am the beginning of a line of text, then I run `C-k` to delete it. The line is deleted, then it shows up again for a brief moment, and then not anymore. Just to clarify, let me add the sequence of events:
  
(line present) Displays line
 (deteles line) `C-k`
 (line deleted) No display line
 (line deleted) Displays line for a brief moment
 (line deleted) No display line
  
This behavior happens with basically everything, meaning the new "state" (a word is typed, a buffer is switched, etc) is displayed and then momentarily goes back to the previous "state" (when the word had been typed, etc).
 My problem felt similar to this https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/112uuse/emacs_29060_is_bit_jumpy_scrolling_when_using/ but it isn't because I emptied my `init.el` and the problem still persists. Also, when I run `emacs -nw` in the terminal, then there is no problem. So, it is something with the rendering, but I have no idea how to even tackle this. Any help/guidance is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was so excited to discover desktop saving so my emacs window would start in the right place on my various laptops and second monitor setups. But sadly after I pulled the change down to my mac connected to very ultra-wide monitor emacs starts up far to the left and half off screen. (I had previously hacked it with some default-frame-alist stuff that was only good for one box).
 TL;DR: desktop saving code below worked great on single monitor laptop, but chokes when second monitor is ultrawide much bigger than laptop screen.
 Here's the code snippet:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (use-package emacs
 :custom
 (desktop-path '("~/.emacs.d/var/desktop"))
 (desktop-save t)
 :init
 (defun rgr/restore-desktop()
 (when (fboundp 'alert)
 (alert (message (format "loading desktop from %s" desktop-path))))
 ;;I include the run-with-timer despite being able to get this to work without as it's a timing
 ;;issue and a little delay does no one any harm
 (run-at-time "1" nil (lambda()
 (desktop-read)
 (desktop-save-mode 1))))
 (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
 (lambda()
 (if (daemonp)
 (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook 'rgr/restore-desktop)
 (rgr/restore-desktop)))))
 #+end_src

While I have heard of Graal VM for a long time, this is the first time I'll be using it. So far, I've been running into some weird build failure intermittently on Ubuntu. Whereas Windows/MacOS builds work fine. I'll be using the Typelevel stack.
 While I'm continuing with my experiments at the moment, I was wondering if anyone here has any experience building with scala + graal. I'm also wondering if I'm better off with golang (hate the lang) or Rust (won't be super productive for a while for me)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys. I've been using (neo)vim for 1-2 years now. I use emacs for note-taking only (rarely)
 The reason I use emacs much less than neovim is the simplicity (of lua) and performance.
 I find neovim REALLY fast while It's obvious that emacs is less performant.
 Point of this post is: (as a non-power emacs user) 
 How'd you compare lua vs elisp
 How'd you compare emacs with a "well configured" neovim (in context of lua what is the difference between elisp? [except the power of GUI])
 - There are lot of plugins that will "keep you in neovim" (~~living~~) like plugins that integrate with web (e.g godbolt, stackoverflow etc.)
 - I am no near being a emacs power-user nor a GUI guy
 Why should I use emacs?
 Why not neovim
 ​
 > I think Neovim can "almost" be powerful as emacs (while keeping the performance [0])
 > Is it correct?
 > [HERE IS LINK TO MY CONFIG [WIP] IN NEOVIM](https://github.com/UTFeight/CamelVim) -> there is a feature list in README (outdated)
 > [HERE IS MY EMACS CONFIG](https://github.com/UTFeight/dot-doom) -> Simple doomemacs with org-mode 
 ---------
 [0] -> Thanks to plugins like `Lazy.nvim` and lua

 I'm successfully build a REST API via Haskell/Servant and have a OpenAPI spec generated by Servant .
 I'm thinking of building a web UI that enable user to play around with the API.
 Is there any way to automatically generate web UI form from openAPI spec or Haskell types ? 
 I've tried with https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form ,but the performance is poor when dealing with deep nested form with many inputs.

 I am emacs noob so forgive me if this is a dumb question.
 I have FlyMake running for java as shown in the screenshot. Is there any way that FlyMake shows how to fix error suggestions or is that simply not a feature of FlyMake? Like in the screenshot example, I want FlyMake to make the suggestion to import java.util.Scanner since I am using a scanner, not just simply tell me that there's some error because it can't find a Scanner object, that kind of stuff.

 However I found out Corfu will wait for LSP's response and show all candidates. I want it to be like my Nvim, imediate show the buffer candidate or other candidate and update the result list when LSP responds.
 Can I do that? I found lsp-bridge can do that but I always want to use the package without dependencies (Python) and use native component like corfu. Hope anyone can help.
 Sorry about my English.

To me the next step is to make a small project to i) get some real world experience of writing something complete/useful in Haskell, getting to know some libraries beside prelude ii) showcase to eventual employer that I have a basic understanding of Haskell. I'm wondering if some of you went through this or had some suggestions for that kind of project (bonus point if it resonates with some real use case of Haskell, and is not a generic portfolio project that I would do with any other language).

My name is Kostas and I am 42 years old, having a wonderful family and for the last 20 years I have worked as a computer system and network engineer.
Two years ago I was hired by an international company and changed my career path, so I am currently working as DevOps. After this change, I noticed that I had some knowledge gaps I wanted to fill and some skills I wanted to improve.
I read technical documentation and watch online courses or webinars about technologies that were not my area of expertise, practices that are mostly in the software engineering world, new network or security concepts, and other stuff related to the so called "soft skills", such as How to Write Technical Documentation, How to become Persuasive, Give successful presentation, foreign languages. And on top of that I have lots of family concerns such as, family psychology, recurring tasks, hobbies and other.
For all the above, my brain cannot keep everything and thus the search some months ago brought me in front of some new to me methods, like zettelkasten, BASB, How to Take Smart Notes and lots of software. But to be honest, I haven't found my own workflow yet, what system to follow and what software to combine. I hope "building-a-second-brain-and-zettelkasten" will be something I could use for tasks and knowledge, but we'll see 
I read so many great forum posts here and shared workflows, I watch your great videos in youtube and I try to adjust my workflow when I see something that could make it better.
I'm glad that I join zettelkasten.de forums]]></summary>

 First, the problem description: As part of my 29.1 overhaul of my configuration I decided to add the pdf-tools package. I based my use-package block almost verbatim off of Sophie Bosio's configuration. This has the advantage of delaying the install of the package until you first load a PDF. But upon opening a PDF, the installation failed when trying to build the epdfinfo server utility.

Error: [S-775]

It's definitely not my internet connection, since I also tried it on a virtual Linux machine and it worked fine. I tried to purge stack, ghc, ghcup, cabal and then reinstall them via ghcup but I still get this. Cabal works just fine. Perhaps I didn't delete everything before reinstalling, I don't know where data is cached and I really don't want to reinstall Linux to fix this. Any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago I noticed that after Emacs I did have all the magit commands available, but forge wasn't loaded properly -- I saw no topics (Issues and Pull requests) not even in the project where I knew there were some and where I'd previously run forge-pull to set the local state up properly.
 Yesterday I thought I'd see if I could fix this. So started with trimming my setup down to the bare minimimum
 ``` (use-package magit :custom (magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-traditional))
 (use-package forge :after magit) ```
 and found that to be working well, i.e. I didn't have to manually "start" forge by running e.g. forge-pull. I then re-introduced my setup piece by piece to see when it breaks. (Luckily it's not very big.)
 In the end I made this change, where the relevant bit is this:
  (use-package forge :after magit - :general + :config (mes/despot-def forge-post-mode-map "c" '("submit" . forge-post-submit) 
 That is, I swapped the use of :general to :config when bringing in forge. (I'm still using :general when setting up magit as using :configresulted in keybindings going missing.)
 I can't pretend I know what's going on here, but my gut tells me there's some "interesting" interaction between straight.el, general.el going on.
 I'd love an explanation, but I'll be happy enough if this post will reduce someone else's head scratching when observing something similar.

 When I started college, I needed to create my school schedules mostly from scratch (selecting individual classes and checking that my classes didn't overlap). Unfortunately, doing it manually is very tiring, slow and prone to error. 
 So I thought: why not automate it? this is the result of that experiment. Ofc, this is a haskell sub, so obviously it is written in haskell. I'd appreciate very much if someone more experienced than me wants to take a look at the code for some feedback! :)
 Basically schedule-maker works by creating a yaml file with the specification of the classes you might consider taking. Then run schedule-maker classes.yaml and it will spit out a schedules.xlsx file with a valid schedule per worksheet.
 There are a some more features. For more information the rep…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to offload multi-line templates in my org-config to files to make formatting both the template and my config simpler. However I'm running into type issues.
 Excerpt:
 (defvar my/org-capture-templates-dir "~/org/templates/org-capture" "Directory for \\='org-capture\\=' template files.") (defun org-journal-find-location () "Open today's journal. Specify a non-nil prefix to inhibit inserting the heading" (org-journal-new-entry t) (goto-char (point-min))) (setq org-capture-templates '(("j" "Journal Capture Group") ("jd" "Daily Goals" entry (function org-journal-find-location) (file (concat my/org-capture-templates-dir "daily-goals.org")) :empty-lines 1) ("jj" "Journal" entry (function org-journal-find-location) "* %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)%^{Title}\n%i%?"))) 
 Problem: When I try to invoke the template with 'C-c c j d' I get:
 org-capture: Wrong type argument: stringp, (concat my/org-capture-templates-dir "/daily-goals.org") 
 I can use 'C-c c j j' perfectly fine to append a new entry in my Journal file.
 I can get it to work as desired if I instead replace the concat with the string I expect to get like so:
 (setq org-capture-templates '(("j" "Journal Capture Group") ("jd" "Daily Goals" entry (function org-journal-find-location) (file "~/org/templates/org-capture/daily-goals.org") :empty-lines 1))) 
 Question: There's something I'm not understanding about how to use the output of the concat function as a string for a filename here. I'd prefer not to type the full file name every time, especially as I define more templates. How can I get the concat to work?
 ​
 For reference, the template 'daily-goals.org' contents are:
 * %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)Daily Goals Today I plan to: 1. %^{goal-one} 2. %^{goal-two} 3. %^{goal-three} %? 
 Also, my full capture config can be found here: paraparity configuration.org. I'll always welcome feedback on my config and how I can terse up some of my emacs lisp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For ages I have tried and failed to come up with an Org mode approach to answering the eternal question we often ask ourselves:
  
What (TF!) did I work on this week?
  
Or, more to the point, I want to get Org mode to answer the following question, often asked of us by our managers:
  
What did you work on this week?
  
In other words, I'd like to get Org mode to generate a share-able report that:
  
Draws from some pre-defined subset of all my org files. For example: all files in org-agenda-files plus whatever is in org-agenda-text-search-extra-files
 Includes any given headline (from the above files) if and only if it has a clock entry in a specified period -- last week, two months ago, etc
 Lists the headlines in chronological order (ascending, or user-selectable)
 Displays the headline itself, plus the relevant clock entry and associated text (i.e. it's not just an clock table)
 Is exportable using org-export-dispatch << This is important because the report is for more than just my own benefit. So, a mere dynamic view within emacs is not sufficient. I need to be able to produce a PDF, or HTML, or the like.
 Can do all this based only on the data and meta-data in the headlines themselves. That is, it should achieve my desired data output format without enforcing on me a data storage format. I'm adding this requirement because my (partial) solution to the problem so far has been to store my daily notes in a datetree format (fed by org-capture), which encodes information not just with a heading's data and meta-data but also in its position. But that is neither a complete solution, nor a good one even where it does go part way.
  
How would/do you achieve this or something like it?[1]
 thx!
 [1] Ideally, using Org out-of-the-box, without having to write a bunch of lisp. But, failing that, I'd take pointers to lisp approaches. (TBH, I'd take the lisp itself, if you had it, but that would be above and beyond the call on your part! :-) )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 I've been out of the Scala scene for a couple of years, and looking to find employment in my fav language again. What's changed?
 Essentially, what I'm wondering is whether it's worth it professionally to double-down on Scala in '23, if what I want to do is FP, DSLs or, at the very least, core-Scala, and not Spark?
  
What are the trends for industry adoption, besides Spark?
 
Is Spark still "the killer app"? (I've done some Spark, can't say I liked it)
 
Is Scala 3 gaining traction in industry?
 
Are Cats/ZIO gaining traction, becoming more niche, and have the culture wars finally stopped?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello friends, I'm getting the following error when I'm installing xmonad with stack. I'm using this custom GHC version that's compiled with musl libc.
 configure: error: X11/extensions/Xrandr.h (from libXrandr) is required 
 Which makes sense, so I installed libXrandr from my distribution's package manager (Gentoo). But unlike the many other times I have installed XMonad on a glibc system, this time installing libXrandr did not get the error to go away.
 I additionally installed libXinerama through my package manager but the output also complained that it does not find it, but it's not required like Xrandr is so it's not a big deal.
 I run the following command as indicated by the page of the custom GHC build.
 stack install --ghc-options ' -static -optl-static -optl-pthread -fPIC' --docker --docker-image "utdemir/ghc-musl:v25-ghc944" --no-nix 
 My stack.yaml contains the following:
 resolver: ghc-9.4.4 packages: xmonad-git xmonad-contrib-git extra-deps: 'random-1.2.1' 'X11-1.10.3' 'data-default-class-0.1.2.0' 'setlocale-1.0.0.10' 'X11-xft-0.3.4' 'utf8-string-1.0.2' 'splitmix-0.1.0.4' 
 I'd imagine it has do to with GHC being a docker image but I can't be too sure.The issue is that despite installing the required dependency which would normally fix this trivial error,stack does not recognize that it has been installed.
 Please keep in mind that I'm in no way knowledgeable in anything Haskell related. Feel free to ask for any output or information.
 Any hints towards the right directions are greatly appreciated. Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, fellas! Beginner haskeller here. I've come across an interesting problem when configuring Vim surprisingly.
 Description. Given several lists ordered by priority, I want to gather unique elements from them. There needs to be at most n elements overall. For each list there is its own limit k of elements I want to take from it. Only the elements that are actually taken (so, overall unique) come towards filling the limits. I attached some test cases in a separate file in case you want to give it a shot by yourself first.
 I decided to give it a go using Haskell as it is pretty abstract and I couldn't come up with anything elegant using Python.
 The imperative version seems pretty straightforward, although I haven't programmed it.
 Here's my solution: https://gist.github.com/EgZvor/12268b0d439bd916c693c38b1fd853c8 . I can't help but think it can be simpler, so as to improve readability of a hypothetical imperative version.

 Maybe this question is better suited for /haskellquestions but can you point out what is making this code so slow? (Taking more than 10 seconds before I aborted it) It is fast until r = 10, b = 10. Writing the equivalent in C++ has allowed me to compute r = 100, b = 100 in a flash. Something is up. It is a simple memoization task

 The current implementation uses SVG to display Sixel image (and UTF-8 half block character when Emacs is itself running inside a terminal). Is there any other image format that is faster in Emacs?
 If you don't know what Eat is, Eat (Emulate A Terminal) is a reasonably fast pure Emacs Lisp terminal emulator for Emacs. In addition to other things, it features better keybindings, shell integration, mouse support, and now, Sixel support.
 And by the way, I was thinking about a talk about Eat at EmacsConf. What do you think?

 It's got all usual features of a standard calculator + an advanced editor where you can write complex mathematical expressions, and also save them for future use.
 Please check it out and if you like it, give it 5 stars, and tell your friends. Everyone needs a calculator written in Scala 3, after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The emacs-mac Emacs port uses native Mac tabs, which blend in better with other apps, can be manipulated by mouse, and provide a nice "tab overview" (graphical thumbnails of all open tabs), etc. But one feature tab-bar-mode had over native tabs is the ability to save/restore the tab configuration, via desktop.el.
 mac-tab-desktop is a tiny package that enables saving/restoring the native Mac tab configuration with desktop.el. Simply turn it on and it just works like you'd expect. It can also be used for other tools that manipulate "framesets".

 In my current emacs 29.1 setup I have frame titles setup "dynamically" by setting:
  
(setq-default frame-title-format "%b - Emacs")
  
This works well for the first frame created but every other frame created with C-X 5 2 or emacsclient have a title set to initial buffer file name, it seems. 
 Am I missing something or have I come across a bug?
 EDIT: I should probably add that I run a PGTK build under swaywm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had a quick once over of the book & decided it's time to tackle it. I am planning on following along in Scala 3 as I figured while it might add an additional challenge, I should gain insights about either version of Scala in the process through contrast. Maybe flawed logic, we will see.
 From my limited experience, the main 4 differences I've picked are;
 Ember instead of Blaze when using HTTP4s,
 Opaque types / Iron rather than @ newtype / Refined
 Givens instead of Implicits
 Some difference when using Circe.
 Are there any other gotchas I should be aware of before I get cracking?
 Will this detour be beneficial for my growth or will it hinder my progress?
 It will not be the end of the world if I have to pivot but It'd nice not to have too many nasty suprises.
 Additionally if there are any other resources I should be aware of that would supplement the read well I'm all ears.
 Currently have;
 Red Book,
 Scala with Cats, &
 Programming in Scala 5th ed. for reference.
 Still slowly getting to grips with Cats (essential effects would be nice) but figured I would learn by example & reference with Cats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have the ~/.authinfo.gpg file in my home directory, and I can encrypt/decrypt the file correctly.
 When using auth info, if the info is already in the .authinfo.gpg file, emacs will ask me to unlock my gpg key, then it can use the auth info correctly.
 But if the auth info is not in the .authinfo.gpg file, it will prompt me to save it into the .authinfo file, and the content is not encrypted.
 Any idea why auth info can automatically read from .authinfo.gpg, but cannot save to it?
 Thanks

 I know that network effects are hard to overcome and that some of you don't particularly care about the issues with Reddit management, or don't make "fighting against Social Media and Big Tech" a hill to die on, but I strongly feel like the time for centralized social platforms has passed. We gave away too many of our freedoms in exchange of convenience, but now the costs are too much to ignore.
 You might have received already a DM from me inviting you to join our Emacs community on Lemmy. It's slowly but steadily getting traction and activity, to the point that you might have even seen it mentioned at Sacha's blog.
 Over there, one of the things that we are still missing is content from people with questions, or small tips/tricks to share. I was thinking of automating some of this work I've been doing and I started working on a small bot that could post a comment on every "self" post asking the OP to also take a look at the alternatives. 
 The question is: would that be ok with the mods and the community here? If a bot posting on every comment is too much I can maybe make a rule for limiting to 2-3 submissions a day, but more than anything I would like to know if the community at large would consider this alternative or if most are actively in favor of sticking to reddit.

 "The influence of Scheme on Lua has gradually increased during Lua’s evolution: initially, Scheme was just a language in the background, but later it became increasingly important as a source of inspiration, especially with the introduction of anonymous functions and full lexical scoping" 
 https://www.lua.org/doc/hopl.pdf
 Neovim -- I understand this to be the hot new thing in the vim world [1], correct me if I'm wrong -- uses luascript too. Emacs has the evil-mode of fame (amongst other modal editing packages). This whimsical post is just me pontificating on how all's well that ends well in regards to the editor wars of old that I was too young to experience firsthand. 
 Only took a couple of decades lol. I am curious though, regardless of emacs or vi keybindings, I believe it common to use 'ctrl' more than 'alt' so I've swapped them. Anatomically speaking, our thumbs are stronger digits than pinkies. Am I right in assuming that's the reason so many of the venerable default bindings are on 'ctrl'?
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard
 How many years before this accident of history is undone, lisp machines become mainstream and we eradicate the dreaded 'emacs pinkie' like humanity has done to smallpox? Rhetorical question, you can tell I've too much spare time on my hands. 
 Emacs > Vim ;)

 SAF document providers are the closest things to FUSE that Android can offer. NextCloud implements a document provider, giving its users the ability to keep local copies of cloud files transparently, keep placeholders of online-only files, offer bidirectional sync.
 However, as the Emacs manual states, document providers are kinda limited:
  
Subprocesses can't access files in the document provider (this means no shell commands)
 No symlinks are allowed
  
This is kind of a deal breaker: simple editing of Org files could still be feasible, but anything slightly more advanced might not. Using nov.el, for example, is not feasible since it require extracting with the tar command.
 A solution is to simply copy files outside the /content/storage/ (document providers directory) before opening them in a buffer. However doing so manually is stressful and not tidy at all. Is there a way to transparently copy files in a temporary location before opening them, and automatically update the source file when needed?
 What could be other ways to make document providers more practical to use?
 TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lets assume I have a function f that performs two different actions depending on whether it is called for the first time or not.
 How could I achieve this? Should I use the state monad, which I didn’t really understood yet?
 My actual problem is a graphical application with a save button, which has to open a file dialog when clicked for the first time, because we do not have a file name yet. But if we have already created a file it should just overwrite the file.
 So what would I need to do with this example function in order to let it handle the state.
 onButtonClick :: ByteString -> IO () onButtonClick text = do state <- checkState case state of Nothing -> do file <- fileDialogSave writeToFile text file Just file -> writeToFile text file 
 In my case this function needs to have an `IO ()`, I guess, as I am using GTK and this is how it gets invoked.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gtk-4.0.8/docs/GI-Gtk-Objects-Button.html#v:onButtonClicked
 I know there is a lot of material about the state monad, but I can’t really see how to use it in my case
 Solution: 
 I was thinking to complicated as the solution is fairly simple as /u/AshleyYakeley pointed out.
 I Just need to create an IORef FilePath with:
 fileRef <- newIORef "" 
 and pass it to the function:
 onButtonClick :: IORef FilePath -> ByteString -> IO () onButtonClick fileRef text = do filePath <- readIORef fileRef case filePath of "" -> do file <- fileDialogSave writeToFile text file writeIORef fileRef $ getPath file file -> writeToFile text file

 Specifically I'm using project-find-regexp and I'd like to visit matches one by one, work on them, go back to the results, visit another match and so on.
 The way it works at the moment it pops up results in the minibuffer and vanishes when you visit a match.

 Maybe I should experiment with PureScript and Halogen? But maybe there‘s a Haskell alternative? Re-using code with the „isomorphic“ approach of Miso seems to be very interesting, but I know almost nothing about it. It uses GHCJS, is this still state of the art now that the JS backend of GHC is out?
 I‘d like to share Haskell code, but I also would love to have a smooth developing experience and overall elegant declarative code. Any suggestions for me?

My question: if I want to implement a generic version of Free Monad (it's generic enough a little bit like ZIO, Cats but it doesn't need to be production grade), is this the right direction?
 I have this question because I want to play with this concept by implementing it myself. Then I started to search online, finding an explanation like this. I understand the point (though not thoroughly understand everything regarding this term I suppose); however, when checking the examples on the internet, most of them use `List[A] => Option[A]`, or tap in Cats.FunctionK. I am confused generally how it's implemented. Is the example in the video is good enough, or some other implementations are recommended as references?
 Many thanks for answering my elementary school level question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an example project with two things scheduled, one on Monday and the next on Tuesday, is it possible to move forward both scheduled dates, eg by a day, at once? Both would be under the same heading "project foo".
 This would help with project planning. Otherwise I would need to update every TODO seperately when the timing changes.

 (use-package org-gcal :init (setq org-gcal-client-id "..." org-gcal-client-secret "..." org-gcal-fetch-file-alist '(("myemail@gmail.com" . "~/gmail.org") )) ) 
 I was able to use org-gcal-fetch and get all of the current calendar entries into ~/gmail.org
 If I create a new entry and use org-gcal-post-at-point it creates a new calendar entry on google calendar. I then change the name of the entry in the org file and then use org-gcal-sync it updates correctly in google calendar as well.
 But on entries that already existed in the calendar before the original fetch, I can push them to with org-gcal-post-at-point to update the title. But org-gcal-sync never work.
 I would expect org-gcal-sync to make google calendar match the org file. Am I misunderstanding how org-gcal works or is this a bug?

I have installed `ruff` (yet) another python linter and set this variable to `("ruff" "--quiet" "--stdin-filename=stdin" "-")` but flymake does not report any errors when enabled in a python buffer. I'm aware of the `flymake-ruff` package but was wondering if setting this variable would mean I didn't need that package. Thanks for your time.
 Edit: I found this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/10yzhmn/flymake_just_works_with_ruff/) and saw how to correctly set this variable but still no joy. I'm still on Emacs 27.1 if that matters but the latest flymake.

 I want to learn Scala as my second FP language. I know Haskell and I am somewhere between an Apprentice & Journeyman. In the sense that I can read and understand Haskell code, and write trivial programs and rest services. I am quite familiar with Haskell Transformers and general FP style of programming.
 With this background, I was looking to dive into Scala and learn the language for fun (& maybe profit). Programming in Scala seems to be the authoritative book for this. I have two questions.
  
Is it a good choice for someone who knows Haskell and general FP principals?
 If yes, should I go for the 4th edition which is for Scala 2 or the 5th edition which is for Scala 3?
  
​
 TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some of the projects I work with, there might be 25+ imports at the beginning of a file and I almost never need to look at them. On the other hand, I almost never use code folding, and my config already has so many packages in it that I wondered if I could hide those imports using only built-in functionality. Surprisingly, hideshow.el apparently doesn't have this functionality built in, so I took a crack at making it happen.
 After some fiddling, I came up with this: 
 (defun rex/php-fold-use-block-initially () "Hide the initial block of `use' statements in PHP buffers." (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (ignore-errors (re-search-forward "^use ")) (set-mark (point)) (while (ignore-errors (re-search-forward "^use "))) (ignore-errors (hs-hide-comment-region (region-beginning) (region-end))) (deactivate-mark t))) (add-hook 'php-mode-hook hs-minor-mode) (add-hook 'php-mode-hook rex/php-fold-use-block-initially) 
 This does what I want, but it's not elegant and it seems pretty fragile (then again, it hasn't broken yet and I've been using it for a couple of days now). Because it does work, I figured it might help someone else too if I shared it, ymmv. 
 EDIT: In order to hide import/include/whatever keyword your language uses to include code from libraries or elsewhere, you would need to change the regex pattern "^use " to "^include " (for instance) and add the appropriate mode hooks. 
 P.S. Now that I think of it, this function should actually be generalized to accept the pattern as an argument...

 :PROPERTIES table: #+attr_odt: :style tablestyle #+attr_latex: :environment longtable :END: 
 then later i want to be able to tag a header with that property label so that it inherits all of those attributes:
 * I'm going to put tables here :table: | hello | my | table | | is | here | hello 
 Is creating a group of attributes possible in org mode? 
 edit: i've found that I can achieve this with macros. Still curious if there's a way to group a bunch of attributes in a non-macro way

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using the latest git version with pgtk and native comp and I'm noticing a bit of lag when I just move my cursor through a file. I profiled it and it was pointing at a function called redisplay_internal taking up almost all of the usage, but when I expanded it the sub-functions didn't take up as much as redisplay_internal. Emacs -Q causes the redisplay_internal usage to drop considerably and the lag to go away. I'm wondering if anyone has had this issue or if not how I could go about further dissecting what is going on since profiling didn't lead me in the right direction.
 I have a sneaking suspicion doom modeline may be part of the issue since one of its functions has come up in the many profiling runs I've done. Disabling it seemed to help briefly, but redisplay_internal tends to stay higher than the emacs -Q profiling(in that it is lower than running M-x commands in cpu usage).
 EDIT: After singling out parts of my config it seems that doom-modeline is indeed the culprit. Any recommendations for a replacement that looks just as nice?

It's practically the same experience as in Emacs; this is so cool.
 The most important thing is that it's purely locally stored, even the file management system is just like Emacs.

You can also collaborate with ease and enhance your workflow by connecting Metanote with the tools you love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On my journey through the lands of Haskell and GTK4, I once again encountered a problem I am not able to solve for myself, so I again hope for your help:
 I created a Gtk.DropDown from a list of text with Gtk.dropDownNewFromStrings ["1","2"] and now I would like to retrieve its selected value:
 dropdown <- Gtk.dropDownNewFromStrings ["1","2"] -- :: Gtk.DropDown selection <- dropdown.getSelectedItem -- :: GOb.Objects.Object.Object 
 Now the type of selection is GI.GObject.Objects.Object.Object, although actually it is a Gtk.StringList (See: https://discourse.gnome.org/t/get-string-value-from-dropdown-in-gtk4/7911/2)
 If the compiler knew it was a StringList I could do:
 string <- selection.getString 
 But that raises an error of course, because not every GObject has this method.
 I tried to use Gtk.toStringList but that gives me the same error.
 Do you have any idea how to convince GHC that my selection is in fact a StringList and let me retrieve its value?
 Update:
 I found this function which might do what I want:
 Gtk.castTo :: (GHC.Stack.Types.HasCallStack, ManagedPtrNewtype o, TypedObject o, ManagedPtrNewtype o', TypedObject o') => (ManagedPtr o' -> o') -> o -> IO o' 
 And now it works:
 strObj <- Gtk.castTo Gtk.StringObject selection -- :: Maybe StringObject 
 Please down vote or tell me if I should delete this post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi community,
 I am a novice of Emacs and I am trying to config .emacs from scratch. Right now I configure a dozen of packages. I am a emacsclient user: I run emacs --fg-daemon with systemd user session and connect to emacs server through emacsclient (both GUI and TUI).
 The problem I am having now is: after running Emacs GUI client (v29.1 from Ubuntu 22.04 snap install) for a few hours, opening three dozons of buffers plus 1 LSP (gopls), I switched to Emacs client TUI. TUI hangs quickly (less than 1 sec) after connected to the server:
  
I see my active buffer of GUI in TUI for 0.5 sec => based on my understanding, this should not happen: a new client should not render the active buffer of another client
 Emacs TUI switched to scratch
 Emacs TUI stopped unresponsive
 Open another Emacs GUI client and this instance worked fine
  
What's the right way to debug this issue? Is there a way to dump the threads and stacks of the runtime? My hunch is LSP may be the problem. I hope to investigate before asking for more help.
 Thank you!

 The code is almost completely unchanged since prior versions, except for the addition of the obsoleting flag.
 The commit is here:
 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/etc/themes/light-blue-theme.el?h=emacs-29&id=72491495e7b4b574f04fd18902c61dca84dcbc1b
 The commit message says:
 Obsolete the light-blue theme * etc/themes/light-blue-theme.el (light-blue): Make theme obsolete since it's not maintained and seems to serve no particular use case (bug#47047).
 The code itself is here:
 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/themes/light-blue-theme.el?h=emacs-29&id=72491495e7b4b574f04fd18902c61dca84dcbc1b
 The bug report was here, and frankly, I'm just not impressed that these couple of dudes decided it was okay to delete the theme because it was too hard to find a good face esp when they admitted they have absolutely no idea how many people use it.
 https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=47047
 I honestly don't need any sort of themes or styles to be uber awesome, I just want to be able to read the damn screen for hours at a time, and light-blue did that for me.
 Can anyone help me understand what their issue in there thread is, and suggest a better face?
 At any rate, how do I suppress the warning message when loading that specific theme?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 My after-init-hook settings work fine when using Emacs in normal mode. Recently, I wanted to run my emacs in server mode and create a frame using a client. But the frame starts with a different font.
 lisp (setq-default initial-frame-alist '((fullscreen . maximized)) indent-tabs-mode nil default-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8 select-active-regions nil) ) 
 I tried to move my font settings out of the initialization hook, but it makes no difference.
 I guess in server mode, emacs decide not to execute the font setting function because there's nothing to display. But is there a way to tell it to execute the font settings when creating a frame?
 Another issue is that the frame starts in the *scratch* buffer. Is there's way to make it start at the normal GNU welcome buffer?
 Thanks

I'm testing it on a MacBook air m1 with 8G ram (I know, it's a potato computer), I also tried neovim and even vscode just for comparison, and emacs appears to be the only one that is laggy.
 I just like to know if it's normal, is it true that emacs requires more power to run?
 btw, I'm running emacs 29, I read some documents before starting to create `init.el`, and I know emacs has supported native compilation since 28, my understanding is it was enabled by default, correct me if I'm wrong, thank you folks!

 you can also change the date from the agenda view.
 Is there a way to change the time (say from 11:50 to 11:55) from the agenda view?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The code for this sucks, I know. But here's a tweak to my Emacs which I find so incredibly useful I want to share it with you. I call it "electric M-m". Essentially, it makes M-m skip more than just whitespace. So it skips the //, # and ;; at the start of code comments, and also skips the *** TODO [1/10] at the start of Org mode headers. So it skips up to the first bit of proper text. By adding things to skip-prefixes-alist, you can extend this easily to more modes. I've been using this for a few years now and I'm happy with how it works.
 Anyway, here's the code:
 (let ((c-like '("//+!?" "/?\\*+")) (lisp '(";+")) (org-header-regexp (rx bol (+ "*") (+ space) ;; I know this is a filthy way of doing the keywords but I just can't ;; be bothered to do it properly. (? (or "TODO" "NOW" "DONE" "D…]]></summary>

 unfortunately the majority of providers do not do so and it will be up to your client to filter things for you (most of clients does not provide such advanced search tho). although elfeed provides filtering syntax it does not allow having more advanced views of the feeds you are looking for.
 i recently built a self-hostable piece of software that takes an rss/atom feed as a parameter with some regex expression to filter titles, descriptions, content and authors.

 It is because it doesn't make sense or just because people didn't see the need for it ?

 The most significant thing in this release is introducing a compiler plugin with experimental support of direct context encoding. 
 // The idea of a direct context encoding is briefly described in 
 https://rssh.github.io/dotty-cps-async/BasicUsage.html#direct-context-encoding-experimental 
 This brings into the Scala API possibility to use a direct style model, similar to the Kotlin suspended function approach.
 Connected change: automatic coloring is deprecated in favor of the upcoming direct context encoding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am getting started on using Zettelkasten. Here is one of my zettels, the purpose here is to capture concepts in Indian philosophy and discover connections. I look forward to your critiques/feedback:
In Indian philosophy, light can be understood as both physical and metaphysical. 

Prakasha refers to manifested light. There are three types: 
* ordinary fire (_jada agni_), 
* sunlight (_saura agni_), 
* lightning (_vaidyuta agni_).

The original spiritual light is _jyoti_. 

How does physical light interface with the metaphysical?
* Physical light sustains life on Earth, for example, sunlight provides energy through photosynthesis. 
* [[Prometheus stole fire and was punished for giving power to humans]]
* Light enables creation, as consciousness is the first element required.  
* Light is involved in metaphysical visions too:
1._Krishna_ grants _Arjuna_ a glimpse of his effulgent divine form, which _Sanjay_ also perceives through inner sight. 
2. The _Nachiketa_ and _Yama_ story conveys spiritual light's ability to illuminate the knowledge of death and immortality.

 It seems that others have had this thought as well:

I have a similar problem with "I'm". These modifiers work fine in math mode, and typing e.g. "it's" is fine too.
 If I show the list of available modifiers by '?, t and m are both there, with blanks next to them, which I presume should mean (as the documentation suggests) that 't should just produce 't - or should it actually be showing something nonempty?

 Warning: I am a relative noob, so I might say something stupid.
 I am trying to use tree-sitter and eglot, and setup as emacs as my IDE for python. Specifically, the minimum features I'd like to have are:
  
Syntax and variable highlighting, e.g., if I am using a variable it doesn't exist anywhere, it should be highlighted, highlight functions with a color, etc.
 Completion of libraries, but also of variables, e.g., if the variable old_array exists, then I'd like to type `old` the hit tab (or something) and have emacs complete the rest.
 Also, something (like flymake) that highlights syntax errors

I mean for any third party package you can update it once it is ready to be updated. Why do built in packages not work the same way? If flymake has some new update why can't you just get that updated at the same as the third party packages you have installed? Why do you have to either install a newer version of flymake from GNU Elpa or just wait for the new release of Emacs to access the newer version of flymake?

 So far, I've come across Bozhidar's[1] post, which has been quite helpful. What's currently bothering me the most are:
 1) Non-functioning keyboard shortcuts like "Super + arrows" for window manipulation. This is a known bug[2] across all WSLg applications due to the lack of support for this mechanism in non-native Windows' windows.
 2) The inability to open files in the Windows system using Emacs (WSL2). This is particularly frustrating for Org files, of which I have quite a few on my disk.
 3) Duplicate icon on the taskbar. I know it's a minor issue, but it's quite annoying. When I pin a shortcut for Emacs using "Pin to taskbar," then open Emacs using the shortcut, it doesn't "overlay" the pinned application. Instead, a new icon appears next to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to import Yaml and keep the order but the module Data.Yaml uses the Data.Aeson.Keymap type which is unordered. i only need the top level key-map to be ordered.
 What would be a decent way to preserve the order of my yaml file? Should I parse it for a second time and restore to get the order of my keys or can you think of a better approach?
 Edit:
 A solution is to create a list from the same file using this unreadable line of Haskell code:
 let keys = map (fromText . Data.Text.init . decodeUtf8) . filter (not . isSpace . BS.head) . BS.lines $ content 
 where BS is my ByteString import. I can then later map over the keys list and lookup the yaml KeyMap in the right order.
 This solution feels a bit like a hack. So I wonder how you would solve this.
 Also, how would you make that huge line more readable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[when I try out a Scala 3 macro, the inline definition of the macro itself with the Splicing, and the function which e.g. is using Quotations, when I compile this in sbt I get printed all macro println's to the console at compile-time, as it is expected. When I switch to IntelliJ and the Scala plugin, those macro println's are missing when I compile, and I looked into any log I could open, but could not find those macro println's. Any idea how I could see those printlns in Intellij?

However, a couple of days ago magit and project.el started behaving weirdly. I'll ask about magit in this post.
 Whenever I ran `magit-status` inside a project, I got `process-lines-handling-status: Searching for program: No such file or directory, warning: unable to access 'C:/Users/samvidmistry/.gitconfig': Permission denied`. The full stacktrace is in the first screenshot. Upon some digging, I found that `magit-git-executable` was somehow set to `"warning: unable to access 'C:/Users/samvidmistry/.gitconfig': Permission denied"`.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all :) I minimized my problem to this: 
 inline def recurser[T <: Tuple](inline t: T): List[String] = inline t match case _: EmptyTuple => Nil case t: (head *: tail) => val h = dispatcher(t.head) h :: recurser(t.tail) inline def dispatcher[T](inline t: T): String = inline t match case t: Product => val m = summonInline[Mirror.ProductOf[T & Product]] val tup = Tuple.fromProductTyped(t)(using m) recurser(tup).mkString("[", ", ", "]") case _ => t.toString 
 This compiles. However, calling dispatcher on a product type doesn't: 
 dispatcher(1) // works dispatcher(1, 2, 3) // doesn't :( 
 The compiler cannot perform the match in `recurser`: 
 cannot reduce inline match with scrutinee: tup : (tup : m.MirroredElemTypes) patterns : case _:EmptyTuple case t @ _:*:[head @ _, tail @ _] 
 Why is that? Everything seems precisely typed and inlined. Are there any workarounds? I know this particular example can be solved with givens, I'm exploring a given-less design space.

 Thanks in advance :)

Two reasons, first, frameworks simplify onboarding because you can now teach to the framework; the new programmer can be taught only the Haskell needed to operate the framework, and then "proper" Haskell later.
 ​
 We can do this already, but then you have to decide what dialect of Haskell you're aiming to (there are TONS of Simple Haskells in use), and then get annoyed when new hires with Haskell experience get annoyed that your dialect doesn't match their dialect.
 ​
 Second, I've compared a framework-centric approach to a keto-diet, in that it lets you cheat. Boring Haskell means to limit your use of language extensions to the absolutely "crucial", which Boring Hask…]]></summary>

 I suspect what I'm seeing is what's described in #285. However, the fix described there, to modify `markdown-code-face`,
  (custom-set-faces '(markdown-code-face ((t (:inherit default))))) 
 doesn't make any difference.
 My font settings are
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Iosevka" :height 110 :weight 'normal) (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "Iosevka" :height 110 :weight 'normal) (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "Cantarell" :height 110 :weight 'regular) 
 Any suggestions what else to try?
 Could it be something related to my running a PGTK build?

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread.
Things I'm reading:
Wolf, Maryanne. Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain. 2010.
Benedict, Marie, and Murray, Victoria Christopher. The Personal Librarian. 2021.
Donald, Merlin. A mind so rare: the evolution of human consciousness. 2002.
Illich, Ivan. In the vineyard of the text: a commentary to Hugh's Didascalicon. 1993.
Programming  work/fun:
Vocabulary Builder, which blends Keyboard Maestro and OpenAI's ChatGPT4
Things I'm writing about:
Cognitive Extension
Cognitive Expression - Conversation
Cognitive Endurance
Ideas I'm thinking about:
I'm exploring using my structure notes as a thinking canvas.
How the effectiveness of a targeted review practice intersects with active cognition.
Humor
I think that THE key to zettelkasting is every zettel is a proxy for an idea, and the only thing that matters is zettel relatedness to other zettel. Discovery of the scaffolding of zettel relatedness is something that grows organically but can be nurtured as a gardener cares for her flowers, fruits, and veggies. Different strategies will tickle out the relatedness.
How to discover which zettel has the most pixie dust of magic at the moment. I'm getting further on my quest to weigh each zettel by measuring their use and connectivity.
The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.

 e.g. if i type "ali", suggestions would include "align", and "left-align" instead of just "align"

 Eli pushed changes aimed to fix at least one --maybe several-- scrolling bugs, and issued a general request for help testing. Especially, I think, from those with touchpads and heavily customized scrolling behavior.

 Relatedly, I've stepped up my own pipeline for building Windows binaries. For the moment, I (try to) build after basically any push to "release" or "development" branches. (Treesitter grammer DLLs are still refreshed manually when I think of it.)

 I recently (very recently) got hooked on Doom EMACS, and from all the videos I've watched I see how powerful it is. I mainly want to use the org mode, and I encounter four major difficulties :
  
I don't really know how to enter "Insert mode" in an ORG buffer, I just start typing random things until the cursor turns from a box to a line ;
 I don't know how to type special characters like = # = on a buffer, cause Im on Mac and I need to press ALT+3, and that's a keybinding to switch between workspaces;
 I can't really press TAB to show/hide content of headlines, all it does is it adds an extra tabulation (Demoting the headline) ;
 I don't know how to change the headline ticks.
  
Can someone please show me how to do all these things, cause Chat GPT is giving me some nonsense responses.

 I've recently embarked on my Haskell learning journey and have acquired the book "Effective Haskell". However, as I want to delve deeper, I feel like I'm missing some of the mathematical foundations upon which functional programming is based. I don't only want to know the HOW, but also the WHY.
 A bit about me: I'm currently in the 5th semester of Applied Computer Science, so I have a foundational understanding of mathematics. However, I'd like to bridge the gap between my current knowledge and what's required to truly grasp the concepts in Haskell.
 Could any of you recommend books or resources that elucidate the mathematical principles essential for Haskell? I'm particularly interested in materials that would fit well with someone at my academic stage and can help me connect the dots between math and functional programming.
 Thanks in advance for your suggestions!

Currently I just have a basic html and css file and it's still very minimal but I am wondering if I should incorporate something like php to be able to make blog posts in markdown or org mode rather.
 I do not have very much experience in web dev but am pretty decent in other back end and system languages and find php to be sorta similar to bash. Creating a blog from scratch kinda seems like the long route to a simple solution but it's more of a learning experience as well as having control over the skeletal structure and knowing whats behind everything. This will also give me control over the customization of the pages. Any help would be greatly appreciated thank you 
 EDIT: After a few responses and reading over a couple tutorials I've learned you can basically build your own blog directly in Emacs. No php required ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 So I'm in the process of figuring out how I can sync my phone notes to my local file server with Synching occasionally. Basically 'phonenotes.org' from one machine to another. That being noted, I have another file called notes.org on my file server that basically lists completed tasks under a following format:
 ```
 *COMPLETED TASKS 2023
 ** Week of 08-14-2023
 *** Date
 Completed task summary
 ```
 In my actual phone notes file, I have this for an example:
 ```
 Title: 08-15-2023
 Recorded music
 ```
 With this in mind, how do I facilitate the ability to routinely ingest any of the notes that are date based on the phone note title itself from Orgzly so that it automatically determines the Monday of the given week, creates a 'Week of (Starting Monday of that week)' subheading in the 'notes.org' file and slams that new note in there?
 Sorry if it sounds complicated but I do this manually all the time and I wanted an easier way to do this programatically with Org Mode.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am trying to figure out a way to define an interactive function that:
  
Prompts a list of bibliography from a bibtex source file for selection.
 Based on the selected citation, populate an org-roam template involving the citation title, author names, etc.
  
I have tried to follow this guide which uses org-cite and citar, and got it somewhat working by modifying their org-roam-node-from-cite function, but I couldn't get it working completely because there seems to have been some API changes in citar that broke the code as it is.
 I have also seen this guide using org-ref, but I would like to stick to the built-in org-cite if possible. Any help is appreciated, thanks!
 My current function modified from Kristoffer's guide: ``` ;; Create a new node from a bibliographic source. taken from ;; https://jethrokuan.github.io/org-roam-guide/ (defun org-roam-node-from-cite (keys-entries) (interactive (list (citar-select-refs :multiple nil))) (let ((title (citar-format--entry (cdr '(keys-entries nil)) "${author editor}${date urldate} :: ${title}"))) (org-roam-capture- :templates '(("r" "reference" plain "%?" :if-new (file+head "references/${citekey}.org" ":properties: :roam_refs: [cite:@${citekey}] :end:
 +title: ${title}
 +filetags: %(insert-lit-category)\n")
  :immediate-finish t :unnarrowed t)) :info (list :citekey (car keys-entries)) :node (org-roam-node-create :title title) :props '(:finalize find-file))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm using emacs centaur which is using project (and not projectile).
 For a small hello project, I could solve a first issue of LSP folder path :
 How to remind lsp-workspace-folder (+ to be used by DAP) ? : emacs (reddit.com) 
 Now, I'm on project with several sub folders with their own compile_commands.json, .git ....
 There is also a compile_commands.json on root, the most important.
 I created an empty .project file on root to try to solve the problem. I thought it should be the same that for .projectile. 
 I do project-switch-project and choose directory on root.
 I select the file I need with compile_commands.json on root.
 The LSP folder workspace is starting with compile_commands.json on a sub folder ... 
 Even with .project + (setq lsp-auto-guess-root t) in custom-post.el + remove compile_commands.json of the sub-folder used + delete of sub-folder with lsp-workspace-folder-remove + add of root with with lsp-workspace-folders-add
 I still have the sub-folder selected for project and lsp-workspace-folder ... 
 Please, if you have advice to solve this issue to force to declare a project directory and not auto-detect the git project of the file selected ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi people,
 After months of previous attempt on using DOOM Emacs, I'm trying to give Emacs a new try but this time with my own configuration and no Evil in the mix.
 I saw the fantastic news about the Emacs 29.1 major version, like having Eglot and Treesit built-in; so I decided to give it a try, but unfortunately no success :( 
 When I run the treesit-install-language-grammar I receive the following error.
  Warning (treesit): Error encountered when installing language grammar: (file-missing Setting current directory No such file or directory /tmp/treesit-workdir1YJ0sh/repo/src) 
 After checking the temporary folder I could find that is empty, seems like not even the git clone is executed.
 Anyone already faced this issue and was able to solve, or have any idea of what is happening.
 Thanks

 ​
 I just found out about this function to detangle from the source code to the main org file. However, I cannot do this in my configuration (doom-emacs), having an error message saying that 0 code blocks were detangled. I am using the `:comments link` option as well.
 When I tried launching emacs with -Q flag, it didn't find this function. 
 ​
 Does anyone else have a similar issue? Does anyone use it?
 I didn't find any alternative to this feature as well.
 ​
 Many thanks!

However, this has been very painful because I sometimes lose connection (for example if put my Emacs into sleep mode) and then Tramp freezes emacs and I see a message: "Tramp: Openning connection nil for HOSTNAME"
 I then have to kill emacs and restart.
 Is there a way to make Tramp more robust to connections dropping?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on Windows 10 btw.
 I'm following this tutorial for Clojure: https://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/
 I follow these instructions:
 Do the following to delete your existing Emacs configuration and install the Clojure-friendly one:
  
Close Emacs.
 Delete ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d if they exist. (Windows users, your emacs files will probably live in C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\. So, for example, you would delete C:\Users\jason\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d.) This is where Emacs looks for configuration files, and deleting these files and directories will ensure that you start with a clean slate.
 Download the Emacs configuration zip file listed above and unzip it. Its contents should be a folder, emacs-for-clojure-book1. Run mv path/to/emacs-for-clojure-book1 ~/.emacs.d.
 Open Emacs.
  
When you open Emacs, you may see a lot of activity as Emacs downloads a bunch of useful packages.
 I am able to complete the steps, however I see no activity and nothing being downloaded when I reopen EMACS. Just the regular EMACS screen with the logo.
 Anyone know what I am doing wrong ?
 Here is the file I moved to the .emacs.d folder per the tutorial

 But now in Emacs 28.2 I'm getting next error:
 error: Recursive load, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el 
 https://pastebin.com/CDjLseT2 - Here is my init.org. What's wrong with that? It is actually was "working" configuration untill one day it stoped.
 P.S.: Actually it behave weird after deleting all tmp files and reboot it literaly takes all the configuration from the init.org and putting it into init.el replacing the:
 (require 'org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "init.org" user-emacs-directory)) 
 Is that a bug or new feature in emacs 28.2 or I doing anything wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For one of the things I work on I use emacs exclusively in a terminal over an ssh session rather than through the GUI. I am developing C++ and recently switched from a ycmd setup to using eglot with a more recent clangd. And there's one thing it does that I want it to not do, but I can't identify the name of the behavior to google for how to configure it off (or if it's attributable to eglot or one of the other modes that eglot interacts with).
  
const auto sources: const std::set<SourceDetails> = get_filtered_sources(config, source_options);
  
The text I'm rendering here with strikethrough isn't struck through on my terminal, but it's rendered in a different text color and it's always displayed, but isn't part of the text of the buffer. When I declare a variable with auto it will annotate it with the type of the variable. Or when I call a function it will sometimes tag the names of the arguments like so:
  
config.get<std::string>(tag: "the_key_sought");
  
I would like it to not do this - these annotations unconditionally inserting itself into the flow of text pushes things out of alignment, makes rectangular yank more confusing, etc.
 Does anyone know the name of this behavior or (even better) how to configure my eglot+clangd setup to not do this? Having these annotations appear only on request would be ideal, but having them not appear at all (while not disabling eglot completely) would be a big improvement.

 I'm new to emacs, I switched over to it mostly because of org-mode. Most things are working perfectly, except for the icons in org-mode, and perhaps all icons? I'm not really sure since its the first time I use doom emacs. This is how my org files look:
 my current org-mode
 I checked for the all-the-icons font, and apparently it's installed corrently:

 And here's my doom doctor output:

 I did M-x doom/reload and doom sync, restarted emacs, and it still doesn't work. I've done M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts too. Does anybody know how to fix this?
 Here's my fetch if that helps in any way:

 For clarification, I want my org files to look like this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a literate configuration named "custom-init.org," which is loaded in the init.el file as follows:
 ;; Load the Emacs Lisp code blocks embedded in the literate Org file (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/custom-init.org")) 
 I've noticed that some people use a different loading strategy, where they directly load the Emacs Lisp file if it's available. However, this approach isn't any faster than using org-babel-load-file in my opinion:
 (if (file-exists-p (expand-file-name "config.el" user-emacs-directory)) (load-file (expand-file-name "config.el" user-emacs-directory)) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "custom-init.org" user-emacs-directory))) 
 org-babel-load-file only auto-tangles during startup when it detects a modification; otherwise, it loads the cached stuff.
 The fact that Emacs initially loads the init.el file and then needs to access a different file, regardless of the method used, is what introduces a speed penalty.
 I was thinking about giving up on the Org literate setup, but right now, I don't have much time to redo my Emacs configuration in plain Emacs Lisp. I know there are cool stuff like the outshine mode, etc.. However, I'm wondering if there might be another way. Maybe there's a way to have Org mode directly add everything tangled into the "init.el" file? That would make Emacs load much faster without the need of a server/client thing.
 Also, do you think Org really adds a layer of unnecessary abstraction for a literate config, to the point where I should think about giving up at some stage? I've been considering whether the effort is justified if it's working well.

 I am trying to get CAPE-powered CAPFS going when editing common lisp files. After starting a thread on the working of CAPFS and CAPE, I understood that essentially you need to write a helper function that adds the desired CAPEs in a particular mode, because completion-at-point-functions gets buffer-local values that override its global value.
 Fine and dandy, I did that for modes such as emacs-lisp-mode, lisp-interaction-mode and slime-repl-mode just fine, even those including cape-company-to-capf. Find one (working!) example below: ``` (defun or/cape-capfs-slime-repl-mode () (dolist (e (list #'cape-file (cape-company-to-capf #'company-slime))) (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions e)))
 (use-package cape :hook (slime-repl-mode . or/cape-capfs-slime-repl-mode))…]]></summary>

Of course I could use eglot-format to reindent the entire buffer upon save. But when editing the file, <tab> still uses the major mode's indentation settings.
 I'm writing C++ code and use a .clang-format to control the project code style, which Eglot uses through Clang. I tried to write a eglot-indent-line function and bind it to indent-line-function, as described here. But like the linked email said, simple things like (newline) doesn't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I am learning to use postgresql-simple by building a little website.
 Currently my functions to get data from the database live inside IO [a] where a is a type I am using to model my data.
  getPostById :: Connection -> Int -> IO [Post] getPostById conn x = query conn "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ?" (Only x) 
 I have read that if something bad happens, postgresql-simple throws exceptions such as "FormatError" if the format of the query is no valid SQL. link: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple-0.7.0.0/docs/Database-PostgreSQL-Simple.html#g:13
 What I would like is using IO (Either Text Post) as a return type (so when any exception is thrown, it will get returned as a Left err).
 Is this possible? Is this an antipattern? How else would I handle the exceptions..? I assumed in Haskell it is common to use Maybe or Either to model exceptions/errors and am somewhat surprised about exceptions here.
 Appreciate any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've run into a nice use case for some GADTs using GHC.TypeNats in a project, but I'm having trouble getting anything to typecheck. Specifically, I've isolated the following example:
 data Foo (n :: Nat) where FooZ :: Foo 0 FooS :: Foo n -> Foo (n+1) fooMax :: Foo n -> Foo m -> Foo (max n m) fooMax FooZ x = x fooMax x FooZ = x fooMax (FooS x) (FooS y) = FooS (fooMax x y) 
 (In my actual use case I have some data structure where n encodes a kind of depth, and I want a "merge" function which produces a structure whose depth is the maximum of the depths, but I think the above reproduces my issues quite well.)
 This fails to typecheck, since ghc doesn't infer that max n 0 ~ n, max 0 n ~ n, and max n1 n2 + 1 ~ max n m given n ~ n1+1 and m~n2+1. I've played with agda in the past, where the solution would be to pass along some kind of witnesses to these relations constructed via induction over the structure of Nat, but here I'm a bit stumped, since as far as I can tell GHC.TypeNats and the operations on them are not built via Peano axioms.
 Can anyone shed some light on how one would go about convincing GHC of the above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I played around with GADTs and realized that data constructor definitions look really confusing to me:
 data Term a where IntTerm :: Int -> Term Int BoolTerm :: Bool -> Term Bool SumTerm :: Term Int -> Term Int -> Term Int EqTerm :: (Show x) => Term x -> Term x -> Term Bool 
 The main reason is that they just look like function type definitions, I do not define their "implementation" anywhere. Yet they can be used at runtime and somehow construct values of the type Term a.
 Is it correct to say that a definition like
 EqTerm :: (Show x) => Term x -> Term x -> Term Bool 
 ultimately means something like "at runtime store a tuple of (ADT tag for EqTerm, x, x), call it EqTerm in pattern matching, and for type checking assume that this value has type Term Bool and that the contents implement Show"?
 And also, does using a GADT prevent some optimizations that could be possible for a regular ADT, like storing unboxed representation of contents?
 Thanks!

 I've created an init.el file with the following contents:
 (require 'org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "config.org" user-emacs-directory)) 
 And here's the content of the config.org file:
 * Configuration #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (menu-bar-mode -1) (tool-bar-mode -1) #+END_SRC 
 Both of these files are located in the ~/.config/emacs directory.
 However, the config.org file doesn't seem to be sourced in the init.el file, and I'm not quite sure why. I've watched a couple of YouTube videos and visited some websites, and I'm following the exact steps they're showing, but it's not working for me.
 Could you folks assist me in figuring out what I might be doing wrong here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing with Emacs 29's native tree-sitter for indentation and other ideas. First impression: it's really so very powerful compared to the bad old days of regexp matching and even ppss. It just understand the code. So far so good.
 That said, I've been trying to assess performance impact for applications that run frequently, e.g. via font-lock. Finding node at point is insanely fast: a fraction of a µs. But to my surprise, tree-sitter actions like "find all parent nodes starting from the current node" tend to vary in duration from (still very fast) 2–10µs to hundreds of µs or even several ms, depending on where the search starts from. I certainly expect some variability as you navigate from different depths within the syntax tree, but repeatable factors of 1000 seems a bit extreme, and make it hard to predict performance for latency-sensitive code.
 Does anyone have insight into this performance variability? Do you experience it as well? Perhaps it depends on the parser backend (I've tried only python so far)? Or is it fundamental to the TS algorithm?
 An example simple code to try, from various code locations in a large-ish file:
 (benchmark-run 100000 (let ((n (treesit-node-at (point) 'python))) ; or whichever language you have (while n (setq n (treesit-node-parent n))))) 
 Multiply the result by 10 and that is the number of µs each "navigate up from node" operation takes.

 I don't use midnight mode specifically but I do use clean-buffer-list since I found out about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a math grad student who has been looking for personal knowledge management solutions, and a while back I posted here on my use case. Many people recommended Org Roam, so I took the plunge and have been very happy with that decision. I've used roam to learn new things and better organize and consolidate what I do know, and the results have been excellent so far.
 I'm now trying to extend my system to handle problem sheets and exercises. When I'm working through a math book, I'd like to record of the exercises I solve.
 So for example, if I was working through Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry, I'd like to be able to create a node/org file "Solutions to Hartshorne.org" with the chapter titles as headlines and in each headline I'd have environments like:
 #+begin_problem
 Give an example of an irreducible polynomial f in R[x, y], whose zero set Z(f) is not irreducible.
 #+end_problem
 #+begin_solution
 BLAH BLAH
 #+end_solution
 What I'm hoping for is a good, lightweight LaTeX package or class defining such environments that I can include in the header or setup files so that I can export my org file to PDF and get a nice solution manual. I'd prefer to be able to easily customize the solution numbering to match that of different books i.e. alphabetical, roman, numbers etc. I'd also like to handle problems with multiple parts well. I'm not too worried about the other aspects of the formatting.
 I realize this may be more of a LaTeX question, but hopefully I can get some advice here on how to set up the kind of system I want. Any help or suggestions for a better setup would be very appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using successfully org-roam (from melpa stable) with Emacs 27 and 28, but since I installed version 29.1 on my Artix box I continue to get this error message
 ` (use-package): org-roam/:config: Selecting deleted buffer`
 I already tried to cancel the sqlite database, but no success. Any suggestion?
 ​
 EDIT
  
Removing elc files from org-roam didn't help
 tried to remove the sqlite database: no success
 upgrade packages didn't change anything
 tried different sqlite3 libraries doesn't work
  
[SOLVED]
 Ok, after some other attempts, I find a solution.
  
I changed the melpa repository to the melpa instead of melpa-stable;
 this allowed me to install emacsql-sqlite-builtin package
 I added the instructions  (use-package emacsql-sqlite-builtin) (setq org-roam-database-connector 'sqlite-builtin) 
  
Now org-roam works.
 Thank you all for your help: I hope this will be useful in the future

The M2 version is working flawlessly so far, but the Intel version is being very wonky. When performing various simple operations (such as scrolling) it very often completely blanks out the screen for a few seconds and then returns. What's worse, is that quite frequently, it gets in a state in which it won't respond to any key sequence (not even C-g), and needs to be force quit. They are both running the same init.el files and using the same packages, and both are running the latest version of Ventura. I never had any of these problems before upgrading to 29.1. Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago someone on discourse came with an interesting way of using (or abusing?) the block argument extension which allows this 
 example = fmap do \x → x^2 + 1 do [1, 2, 3] 
 to compile. Basically it allows to use do to replace $ or parenthesis. Beside the fact that it can be a good idea or not it makes me look at the BlockArgument doc.
 I've learn a few usefull stuff. 
  
The grammar is ambiguous regarding the extent of lambda abstractions, let expressions, and conditionals. The ambiguity is resolved by the meta-rule that each of these constructs extends as far to the right as possible.
  
The "as far to the right as possible" means that we don't need the second do.
 so
 example2 = fmap do \x -> x^2 + 1 [1, 2, 3] 
 shoud work and does !. Also 
  
They include do, lambda, if, case, and let expressions.
  
So we shouldn't need the first do because lambda does the same job.
 example3 = fmap \x -> x^2 + 1 [1, 2, 3] 
 But it doesn't compile.
 Neither does
 example4 = fmap \x -> x^2 + 1 do [1, 2, 3] 
 So my question why is that example2 works but example3 and exapmle4 don't ? Is it a bug or am I misunderstanding the doc ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realized today that the most general callCC type is the following:
 newtype Cont r a = Cont {runCont :: (a -> r) -> r} callCC :: ((forall b. a -> Cont r b) -> Cont r a) -> Cont r a callCC f = Cont \k -> runCont (f \a -> Cont \_ -> k a) k 
 The "exit" argument never returns, so it should have arbitrary return type, like any other Haskell function that never returns. Equivalently, it could return Cont r Void. 
 After a quick search I found that the above type was already suggested in 1991. What's the reason behind the current callCC type in Haskell? Is it just because of the lack of RankNTypes or Void support from when it was introduced? Or maybe the more general type is problematic in MonadCont for some reason?

 The Haskell GTK4 binding seem to be maintained (https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi), however there is not much activity and no documentation at all – all the documentation is about GTK3. The only GTK4 app I could find was ghcup-gtk a project in a very early stage.
 So I wanted to ask you if you think that there is any sense in trying to build a GTK4 app in Haskell or should I just move on and learn Rust? I’m still learning Haskell and never did any bigger project with it, but after I’ve seen the delightful world of pure functional programming the imagination of writing imperative code kind of depresses me, you know what I mean?
 Do you know any GTK4/Haskell apps? Have you ever tried to build one? What do you think?

 I've been reading a bit about the new primops for delimited continuations that enable for efficient algebra effects but I don't have a strong understanding of them yet.
 I was wondering if it would be possible to implement something more like the usual callCC using them to capture the current continuation in the IO monad? I'm imagining a function with a type callCC :: ((a -> IO b) -> IO b) -> IO b (modulo some prompt tags) but this seems quite far removed from the provided control0 :: PromptTag a -> ((IO b -> IO a) -> IO a) -> IO b primitive.

 in the last days I took some time to customize my completion setup using vertico, orderless, corfu and cape using the respective github repo's information. Most of this has worked out just fine and I am a lot closer to a comfy and satifsying setup than I ever have been.
 However, there is one thing I simply don't understand, and it relates to the Cape package. The example use-package-declaration features both :bind forms as well as (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-\*) forms.
 So far, I've understood it as :bind forms are there to invoke a specific CAPF while add-to-list forms are there to populate something like a pool from which completion-at-point can choose an according backend when prompted.
 However, there is two things that don't conform with this inte…]]></summary>

 A year ago I tried Elixir and I really liked it. It was simple, immutable, and has no special syntax for side effects. This made it very approachable and I really liked it. When I was trying to learn Haskell I struggled to understand the concept of a Monad. I understand that concepts like Maybe(Haskell) and Result(Rust) are monads but I used them only as Higher Kinded types and had a very intuitive(as opposed to formal) understanding of what they do. I think of them mostly as tags added to a primitive type. Like type Email = Email String (as a quick example), where we say that an Email is a special type of string.

 I'm the author of plainorg.com and have had a fair number of users requesting agenda capabilities (scheduling, custom filters, multi-file support, different kinds of views, syncing, the list goes on). The thing is, building great and polished experiences like these for org on iOS (and anywhere) does require non-trivial effort with lots of iterations to get to that great experience.
 How would you realistically kickstart it and fund it (adverts are not an option)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have recently started using OpenAI-based MacWhisper to dictate notes. Perhaps many of you have used dictation for your notes, but I find that Whisper has extremely high quality and gets things like punctuation, hyphenation, capitalization and so forth correct even with my strongly Indian accent. One of the benefits I have seen from doing this is that my notes have become somewhat more conversational than before. I find this to be a benefit rather than something bad, because it seems to be capturing what I am thinking now somewhat better. Perhaps this conversational tone of the note might be more relatable a few years down the line, but that is just a guess.
All the whisper models of all sizes are free but Macwhisper provides a free way of accessing these for the three smallest models. If you want to use the larger models you have to pay a one-time fee of $20 to make that possible. Perhaps other free tools even with the large models will become available soon. In terms of privacy, one of the good things here is that the model is sitting on your computer so the data never leaves the computer and it seems safe even for private notes for that reason.]]></summary>

 In short, I am trying to achieve a kind of filter and then map effect on Either type based on my parsing result in a same function. This helps me avoid using partial function or duplication of pattern matching for sum types. Example:
 identifierTokenParser :: TokenParser (String, Int, Int) identifierTokenParser = first toParseError $ symMaybeMap getVal where getVal Info {val = Identifier str, startRow = row, startCol = col} = Just (str, row, col) getVal _ = Nothing 
 If here I have used symIf and then fmap kind of thing then there should have been another pattern matching that was fully redundant.
 Just to give context I am pattern matching on programming language tokens:
 data Token = Illegal | Identifier String | Integer String | StringVal String | -- Symbols Comma | Semicolon .... 
 I became curious if it is some standard technique we use and is there any mathematical structure hidden behind this?
 I am quite new to haskell so not sure of Haskell standard patterns.

Is there a way to make it recognize and process the awesome libraries?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am working on a project and I need to write a backend in Scala. I was thinking of using Scalatra but I read some posts and received some feedback indicating that Scala devs prefer a different stack. I remember encountering something like this in the Rust community where backends written in Rust often don't use ORMs ( but there are ORMs available).
 Despite my best efforts, I keep finding new frameworks mentioned here in Reddit that I couldn't find searching on my own. I've also noticed that a lot of articles about Scala are kind of old. How do you keep up with new libraries/frameworks? So I want to reach out to the community and ask: what kind of stack would you use as a backend?
 I am familiar with Postgresql, but it might be the case that in the Scala community there is a special DB framework (like Datomic is for Clojure). I like Functional Programming but I don't want to use monads. I settle with a simple flavor of FP(like Elixir). I've read that effects are easier to use over monads and that Scala has support for effects but I am unfamiliar with the subject. Is it the standard library or is it an external library.
 Thank you for your time

 TL;DR Questions
  
How do I prevent an update from bringing back these unused variables if I fix it? Do I have to fork it? Is there a way to fork it and allow updates to still offer themselves to me so I can use a diff/patch sort of thing? 
 
Why do you think the author included those variables if they're unused? Did they just forget? If you can help me figure out what they were intending to do, I'd like to put the variables to use or just delete the lines with the variable declarations.
 
 Background
 I just started playing with emacs, but I downloaded some evil mode packages because I mainly use vim. To that end, I installed evil-tex. It gave me a bunch of docstring wider than 80 characters warnings, so I did M-x find-library RET evil-tex and broke up all docstrings …]]></summary>

 Has anyone else noticed this? ... when moving the cursor up or down (without changing the column) sometimes (not always) doom-modeline fails to update the line number. Doesn't matter how long I wait, it doesn't update.
 If I turn off doom-modeline, it all works again (just not so pretty).
 It's not one of the laggy issues documented on the doom-modeline github page as the line number is never updated (ie not just slow). Also, I tried those fixes and it's happening on local files, not tramp.
 When the column is updated (left or right movement) both line numbers and column numbers are both updated correctly.
 This is emacs-pgtk-29.1_2 and doom-modeline-20230811.236

 It sounds like you can also customize a lot using just use-package. I was thinking of putting all settings related to a package in its use-package declaration, then using customize for emacs built-in options and faces. Then maybe I could use elisp for hooks, functions, and more complicated customizations.

 Say I add a new keybinding to my *keybindings.el* in the 'settings' directory:
 ;; new binding (global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'org-agenda) (use-package which-key :init (which-key-mode) :diminish which-key-mode :config (setq which-key-idle-delay 2)) (provide 'key-bindings) 
 And in my *init.el* file I have this:
 (setq settings-dir (expand-file-name "settings" user-emacs-directory)) (add-to-list 'load-path settings-dir) 
 Having added the keybinding and run *eval-buffer* inside the *keybindings.el* buffer, I can use the binding right away. If I however remove it from *keybindings.el* and eval-buffer again, it persist.
 What gives here? It seems that generally removing bindings isn't able to be affected by evaluation since I'm able to change the keybinding illustrated above from "C-c a" to "C-c p" and the new binding works, but the old binding appears to still be bound to the function.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to create links to inline latex equation in org mode in a way that makes the referenced equation obvious just from looking at it, without actually following the link.
 Let me clarify this a bit. When I write a latex file, I can create an equation with a label "myeq". Then when I compile the document, the equation is going to appear with a number next to it, and if I reference "myeq" in the text, the reference is going to turn into hyperlink with the number of the equation.
 In contrast, the closest thing I can do in org mode, is adding a #+NAME property to the equation, and referencing it with a standard org-mode link. This translates nicely to latex links if I export it to latex, however, it is sort-of inconvenient if I look at the file in org-mode because the #NAME property disappears when I compile the latex fragments, so I can't tell which equation a given link is pointing to without following it.
 Any ideas how to solve this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using ido-mode for many years now.
 Fido-mode seems like it might be more supported these days, especially since it also seems to apply to completing reads out-of-the-box, whereas I have horrible hacks in my init.el to use ido-mode too that way. And it seems to be a bit better about showing hints or supporting information than ido-mode. (E.g., showing me the character too and not just the unicode name when I tab-complete in C-x 8 RET.)
 But I can't find an equivalent for how ido-mode will cache files and directories that I find things in (and save this in ~/.ido.last), and then, if I C-x C-f and start typing a file name that isn't in the current directory but is in a cached file or directory, it will show the message "Searching for foo..." and then jump right to offering it after a brief pause (the ido-auto-merge-delay-time, I believe).
 Is there an equivalent to this for fido-mode? I looked at recentf-mode, but it seems like it's separate functionality that must be manually invoked, rather than being able to integrate into fido-mode and provide smart filename completion support automatically.
 Am I missing something? Or should I just continue to stay on ido-mode? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One can open an android APK as a project in Android Studio. If the APK has been installed on a mobile that has developer options enabled, it is then possible to get a log of what happens during the apps start up.
 Install the app on the mobile, ensure that the developer options are enabled. In developer options enable USB debugging. Connect the computer to the mobile with a USB cable. At first connection you will have to authorize (on the mobile) access from the computer. In developer options go to "Select debug app" and choose, say "org.gnu.emacs". Also enable "Wait for debugger".
 See the following web page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16929391/android-how-to-debug-apps-start-up-process
 Check that you can access the mobile from the computer by running from the command line e.g.:
 - adb -d shell
 ls
 Now open the APK as a project in Android Studio, if you have not already done this. In the device manager (View > Tool Windows > Device Manager), select you mobile under "Physical".
 Start emacs on the mobile. You should get a requester "Waiting for debugger". In Android Studio select Run > Attach to Process. This should open a debug console, but this window will probably only show that Android Studio connects to the app, but then loses the connection (because the app crashes).
 All is not lost: In the debug window select "Logcat" at the bottom. This will probably also not show a lot, but notice at the top of the window the text "package:myapp" or some such. Change this to "package:org.gnu.emacs", and you should now hopefully see a crash log.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is how I succeeded in building Android emacs with the libpng library. The process is described in the emacs repo file ./java/INSTALL, but here are some additional details. My initial build of emacs with this library crashed at start up. I will describe in a separate post how I debugged this.
 I browsed to https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libpng and made a git clone of the repo. I then used magit to select branch android13-release. There was no Android.mk file in that branch, so I looked for it in older release branches. The newest release branch that had an Android.mk was nougat-release, so I copied that file outside the repo, went back to branch android13-release and moved Android.mk into the repo directory.
 I compared the file to Android.bp but saw essentially nothing that was needed to change. I set LOCAL_SDK_VERSION := 25, but am unsure if that variable has any significance. I eventually compared Android.mk to CMakeLists.txt, and discovered that I had missed a file needed in my_src_files_arm: arm/palette_neon_intrinsics.c
 Building without that extra source file caused no complaint from the build, but emacs crashed at start up.
 To build with the libpng library I added the following option to configure:
 --with-ndk-path=$HOME/projects/android/libpng
 After the build it is a good idea to check that the expected library files are actually in the build directory:
 ls cross/ndk-build

 Does anyone know a better way to preform this task? Something where you don't have to exit a file and re enter into it over and over again.

 def getUsername: IO[String] = ???
 I don't think so because the function just returns a data structure describing the computation of getting username. Additionally, the function doesn't return values such as IO("alvin") or IO("kim") but IO(d()) instead, while d() represents defered execution codes. Am I wrong ?

 The defface is really finicky, you must have '((' for it to work.

 Also, if a variable is not specific to a buffer (buffer local), will using setopt set its value globally, similar to how setq-default works? I mean setopt knows when to use setq vs. setq-default behind the scenes?

I wanted to give Emacs 29 a try (the nixpkgs update seems imminent as of writing though), but I couldn't make the emacs-overlay to work out for me. I'm pretty sure I'm doing something silly and incorrect -- but with Homebrew with emacs-mac, I can use `--with-mac-metal` and other flags such as `--with-no-title-bars`, which I don't see how I can do that with Nix setup. I'm fairly new to Nix and very possible I'm not seeing something obvious.
 I'd like to hear opinions on how people install Emacs on macOS -- do you use Homebrew for apps including Emacs even if you use Nix, or do you stick to Emacs on Nix? What are some of extra flags I should be aware of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow emacs users :)
 Long time basic user here.
 I like to play online radios while I work on emacs. Have this bit of code to play them on emacs:
 ``` (defcustom emms-radio-channels '() "User defined online radio channels." :type '(repeat (cons (string :tag "Name") (string :tag "URL"))) :group 'emms)
 (defun emms-play-radio () "Show candidates from `emms-radio-channels' on a completion buffer. Play the selection using EMMS." (interactive) (let ((channel (completing-read "Channel: " (mapcar #'car emms-radio-channels) nil nil))) (emms-play-url (or (cdr (assoc channel emms-radio-channels)) channel))))
 ```
 Then, I'm using use-package to load my module and customize the list of channels (short example)
  (use-package multimedia :ensure nil :custom (emms-radio-channels '(("openFM - smooth jazz" . "https://stream.open.fm/60") ("jazz radio funk" . "https://jazz-wr06.ice.infomaniak.ch/jazz-wr06-128.mp3") ("bbc radio3" . "https://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_three") ("swingFM" . "https://swingfm.ice.infomaniak.ch/swingfm-128.mp3") ("radioSky - jazz" . "http://listen.radioskymusic.com:7006/live") ("soundtrack radio station" . "http://streamingp.shoutcast.com/JamendoLounge")))) 
 It works great but my list is way longer than that and it is a bit of a pain to add new streams to it.
 I'm wonder if there's a way to convert standalone org links to a list like the above. I'm fairly sure there's a way but I'm a newbie to org mode besides basic outline and babel functions.
 Thanks for your input!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm starting to think about various options for setting up a git repository for my org-roam documents. I don't have anything ultra sensitive in there, but generally speaking it's not intended for public consumption.
 I've thought of just making a private GitHub repository for it, but I'm a little apprehensive about doing that as I wouldn't be surprised if my notes somehow make their way into training data for large language models.
 What are some solutions that you folks use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, going to be honest, I set these configs a long time ago and I've just been using the same configs for years now. I have the following in my ~/.emacs file:
 (setq package-list '(auto-complete restclient go-mode exec-path-from-shell)) (require 'package) (setq package-archives '(("elpa" . "http://tromey.com/elpa/") ("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/") ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/")) (package-initialize) (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents)) (dolist (package package-list) (unless (package-installed-p package) (package-install package))) 
 I've redacted some lines, but I tried to show what I feel like is relevant to my problem.
 I do not have auto-complete installed and every time I attempt to install it, I get a "Not Found" response.
 The following is an example of my ~/.emacs.d directory:
 .emacs.d/ auto-save-list/ elpa/ archives/ elpa/ archive-contents/ gnu/ archive-contents/ 
 I don't see any files (visible and hidden) or additional directories within any of the directories mentioned above.
 Does anyone possibly know the issue I'm running into?
 ​
 Edit:Just want to add that I've also tried the following in place of using setq:
 (add-to-list 'package-archives '("elpa" . "http://tromey.com/elpa/")) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So basically, I want to export my notes which have relative images attached to them, which works really well when I am using it with just org mode. But now I have to export the notes to pdf to share it with the instructor. So I basically want the images to be explicitly embedded in the pdf file, and not a hyperlink pointing to the image.I am getting the desired results by removing the metadata while linking the image in the org file, like just doing [[./filename.png]]. I wanted to know whether there was some way to make this emacs' default behavior?
 I use pandoc to convert org to pdf directly. Pandoc uses pdflatex on the backend.
 Thanks for your time.

When I initiate org-capture, I select a predefined template, and then the screen splits horizontally. The lower half of the screen is where I input the content I'm capturing. I'm wondering if it wouldn't be more convenient to have the capturing process take up the entire window instead of being split. Is there any specific purpose for the upper area during the capturing process?
 I'm curious if there's a customizable variable for this, and I would greatly appreciate your suggestions on the matter.

 However, problem arises when one is too used to those bindings. How many closed tabs in Firefox, oh boy.
 But we are on Emacs, there's a solution for everything, some less practical than others:
  
Remapping C-x and C-c maps is quite a chore, since AFAIK many features are hard coded to those prefixes.
 
CUA mode is also not preferable since C-c and C-c are highly used prefixes
 
Having cut/copy/paste globally bound to different common keys could be an option, however binding settings are relative to specific application or graphical toolkit
 
 What are your experiences in this regard?

 When I check the Eglot events buffer I can see a client request for rangeFormatting but the server reply with a result nil, it seems python-lsp-server does not pickup yapf to do formatting.
 Do I need to do additional configuration in Emacs to get python-lsp-server to use yapf and perform code formatting?

 I.E. M-x <some command> emacs, and it will give me a buffer full of links to the entry headers with the tag "emacs".
 N.B. These are not necessarily agenda files but archival files, or project notes in org-mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tldr: I think Emacs 29 is slower than 28 so I downgraded it. 
 Longer version: I have 2 Apple laptops, one super new, the other super old. I ran either 29 or 30 on them in the past months. In the last couple of weeks I focused on the 29 branch, running the pretests and as of last week, installed the official 29.1.
 I guess I began to see slowness or lagging, since I explicitly began a bankruptcy on the older laptop - initially thinking I have too much packages. Everything was lagging: browsing org files, startup times, describe-variable took couple of seconds to return results, M-x completion with vertico had a noticeable lag with each key press, key press latency in writing, eglot jumping to definitions. So much so that I really started thinking about replacing my old laptop.
 Yesterday I decided that I want to test whether it's due to Emacs. I reverted back to 28.2 on both laptops. It was night and day. The new laptop flies; the old laptop runs smoothly so I even reverted the bankruptcy, adding back all the packages I removed and it's still as smooth as I remember Emacs running in the past. 
 This is not a bug report. It's my own observation, running multiple versions of Emacs on old and new hardware, sometimes compiling from source, sometimes downloading from https://emacsforosx.com/. I just want to raise awareness, see if people have a similar experience. If enough evidence arises, perhaps someone who knows what they're doing can run benchmarks or profiling and we'll go from there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As i'm getting my Emacs config closer and closer to where i want, it inevitably starts "behaving weird". This is something i've struggled with again and again, and it has, once or twice, lead me away from emacs. But now i want to understand this:
 What is the proper order to configure and load stuff in my config, so that everything works correctly?
 Currently i'm facing an issue with standard-themes. Normally, themes are what i put below "emacs internal configs" but at the top of my "external packages". But the standard-themes-light theme doesn't load correctly. Centaur tabs are dark, org-mode code blocks aren't proplerly backgrounded. If i switch themes after starting emacs, and switch back to standard-light, everything is fine. I tried loading the theme as the last thing in my init.el, but that didn't change the behavior.
 This is only one issue currently. I've had others in the past.
 Since i'm pretty new to writing my emacs config from scratch, could some of the "veterans" explain what i should be putting where? Does splitting the config into a few files help? What's the "best practice" here?

 Cats-effect is marketed as a "pure asynchronous runtime" while ZIO provides "type-safe, composable asynchronous and concurrent programming".
 Both of these put quite the emphasis on "asynchronous" and "concurrent", which makes me wonder: 
 Say I want to do what I do now, the basic HTTP crud stuff, but with Scala, is it overkill to go for http4s or zio-http?

 For those of you on a Mac which are you rebinding in this situation? The os shortcut or Emacs. 
 I though I had set the command key to not get passed to the os but that doesn't seem to fix the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking for a good language to implement a personal project I have (a search engine). After listening to Martin Odersky's talk "Simply Scala" at ScalaIO Parris 2022, I decided to give Scala a try. I practiced some Scala 3 and everything worked great. So far I really like the language. I am at the stage of selecting the libraries that I will use for the project. I wanted to implement the backend in Scala but after I stumbled with the Lift framework and after reading other posts on Full Stack Scala, I really want to give it a try. Specially since my UI is going to be simple. I was thinking of using Scalatra for the backend and maybe Lift in the front end (if the UI gets complex enough). But I noticed that both frameworks only have stable versions that are compatible with Scala 2. This article (https://medium.com/@takezoe/scalatra-now-supports-scala3-4eb8988484a7) claims that Scalatra supports Scala 3. It makes sense, since (as I understand) Scala 3 is binary compatible with Scala 2. But the Scalatra docs only covers the Scala 2 version. There are no docs for the Scala 3 version. Is this because there is no meaningful difference between the APIs of the two versions? I also read a post that mentioned that Akka did not fully support Scala 3( I tried finding it again to link it here but I couldn't find it). This gives me the impresion that Scala 3 is still not supported by most libraries.
 I have not tried to run any test projects because I still need to learn how to use sbt (I started learning Scala a couple of days ago). But I got cold feet. Before I proceed, in order to spare myself unnecessary hurdles, I would like some advice. Should I learn Scala 2 and wait until the ecosystem migrates to Scala 3? Or is it recommended to stick to Scala 3 and work around the few incompatibilities that some frameworks might have?

 I'd like to know good resources and opinionated usage examples. 
 Moreover, I'd like to know if org-ql is meant to be an extension or a replacement of org's standard filter predicates. Org agenda's built in filter predicates look quite cumbersome and I'd like to know if it would be possible to configure org agenda by just using org-ql languages or if I'm gonna need to use it anyway.

 Once I press space after the = sign it will automatically auto-complete the correct answer. 
 So essentially you can do simple equations in OneNote without bringing out a calculator. 
 Can we do this in Emacs Org Mode? 
 If we can't its fine as it's not a deal breaker or anything but I am just curious. 
 If my explanation of the feature I want isn't good enough here is the Microsoft webpage where they explain it. https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/insert-and-calculate-simple-math-equations-in-onenote-6d8346d3-2c1e-490b-bcbb-f739d9323e1b

 (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "config.org" user-emacs-directory)) and my config is in config.org. 
 Googling this error says to specify my load-path before org gets loaded. I don't know where org gets loaded - I don't have a use-package org anywhere. Nor do I have a load-path. So I don't know how to even start pin pointing what I did wrong.
 Would this have been better in r/emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given following function with 3 parameters:
 def foo(a: A, b: B, c: C): D = ??? 
 If we know that a changes rarely, we can kind of curry it using OOP:
 class Foo(private val a: A): def foo(b: B, c: C): D = ??? 
 Now, what are reasons to change, say, c to implicit like this:
 class Foo(private val a: A): def foo(b: B)(using c: C): D = ??? 
 My thoughts so far:
  
Capability. Like CanThrow or DbTransaction - indicating function requires special scope for evaluation - e.g. scope catching specific exceptions or scope running database transaction, committing or aborting it in the end.
 Mutable data - to keep our class Foo immutable, we can pass so-called Context containing mutable stuff - caches for example.
 Stateful objects with lifecycle - if C has close() method, we have following options: a) pass c via Foo's constructor and add close() to Foo, making it mutable b) pass c as ordinary parameter which clutters client code without much benefit c) use context function that provides implicit C in scope and closes C when it leaves the scope.
  
I'm calling out for other people's experience - which of those are good ideas? Which are not-so-good ideas? May be there are other considerations?
 This is about dependency management, I would like to leave other uses of implicit parameters out of scope of this discussion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back when I started using Emacs a few years ago, I went all out and added tons of stuff to my setup. But as time passed, I realized I hardly use most of those packages. Nowadays, I'm keeping it minimal and sticking mainly to Org mode.
 I'm thinking of setting up a capture template for my journaling, kind of like this:
 "j" "Journal entry" entry (file+olp+datetree "~/orgfiles/journal.org") "** %^{Heading}") 
 The downside of this approach is that everything will end up in a single file, which might grow over time and become challenging to manage. However, I can archive all the journal entries at the end of the year and starting fresh annually to counter this.
 I've been thinking about whether it's worthwhile to use a separate package, since org-journal appears to generate a similar date tree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I'm having trouble logging in to a remote computer when setting csh as a default shell. I've turned on tramp-debug to 6 and the issue seems to be that Emacs sends the following hardcoded command in tramp-sh.el  "exec env TERM='%s' INSIDE_EMACS='%s' " "ENV=%s %s PROMPT_COMMAND='' PS1=%s PS2='' PS3='' %s %s -i") 
 With the expectation that the shell output is controlled by the variables PS1, PS2, PS3 etc.
 However, from the man pages of csh, the prompt output is controlled by prompt, prompt2 and prompt3. Does emacs tramp have a way to address this? 
 I'm running GNU Emacs 28.2 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2022-09-13 from windows. Again the issues seems that the csh that I'm trying to set as remote does not use PS1, PS2, PS3 and emacs has it hardcoded.

 However, in the case of \chapter* I want to pass the section title to the exporter twice, once as a required argument and once as an optional argument. (I.e. \chapter*[title]{title}.) This is because the optional argument is necessary for memoir to put the chapter title in the running header.
 If I try \\chapter*[%s]{%s} it of course fails with org-export-data: Not enough arguments for format string. Is there a straightforward way to achieve what I want? Has anyone found another way to get running chapter headings working with memoir?

 Somewhere in inbox.org is at least one character that makes "file" think that it's not a text file.
 In GNU Emacs 27.1, both files are shown as "utf-8-unix" in my modeline.
 So the issue with this wrong classification is not within Emacs but within some shell foo I'm doing outside of Emacs.
 Except the obvious bisect-remove-until-found-method: is there a clever (Emacs-)way to locate the character(s) that cause this?

 This is an early product, basically a prototype we have been running with a key customer (soon two) but we have really strong interest and now need to start upping the pace of delivery.
 The current team has some great support from an experienced Haskeller, but only part-time, which has allowed them to get this far but we now need a full-time contractor to come on board and accelerate the project.
 If you have experience shipping actual products built in Haskell, especially in startups (or, at least, early in the project's lifecycle), then please drop me a line (here or by email: gideon@converge.io). I would prefer freelance contractors to big consultancies. We are UK-based, additionally, which means we would prefer someone on UK+-2h timezone (but for the right person we can be flexible).

And as I get ready to explore some of the new features, I'm looking at my configuration with a wary eye; I've been using emacs (GNU, then XEmacs, then back to GNU) since my sophomore year of college (1987!), and my config shows it. Bloated, spaghetti-like, split among 15-16 files, etc.
 So, I'm deciding to take the "configuration bankruptcy" plunge and try to (mostly) restart from scratch. Yank almost everything out and start adding things back as I actually need them, not just because they look cool (and generally never get used).
 Those of you who've done this: any advice? I keep my config in GitHub, so for now I'm just creating a new branch to experiment on. I'm mostly concerned with not losing my history and desktop-mode settings.
 Edit: Just to clarify, despite the longevity I'm not really a "power user". So there are a lot of features that I don't come close to making the most of (Magit, etc.). My hope is that by cleaning this up and tightening things a little, I can grow into some new features.

 A couple of questions
 I seem to remember being able to hotkey from error to error on the output of the compilation at one time rather than using up-downs... how to you do this?
 Every time I compile I end up with yet another pane, I would like to fix the panes to left half full height edit and the make results on the right in a split plane. I know how to split panes but as I am compiling on the left I would like to have the results end up on the right pane... not overtake the left pane.
 Any other suggestions would be great.

When I use emacs -nw while ssh'd from one Mac into another, everything works fine until I switch to another app on the local machine. At first I thought it was Cmd-Tab that was doing it, so I tried just clicking other apps, but the problem remains.
 It appears that any clicks I do in other apps are somehow registering inside of emacs in the terminal. Specifically, when I switch to another app, the emacs buffer also switches to another one. And usually when I click on something in another app (even the preferences app for Terminal itself), the Terminal will randomly insert I and O in whatever buffer is selected.
 Running Emacs 29.1, installed via homebrew. And I've had this issue on an older mac running Big Sur as well as a newer mac running a more recent OS, both ssh-ing into an M1 MacBook pro with all my files on it. 
 Ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 ​
 I am writing a book and have over 250 plaintext files on the computer (all mailed from an app on the phone), about 20 are in org-mode.
 --- The mess ---
 - Snippets are unorganised in every way (made as I come up with them, jumping all over the place in the book-to-be, etc)
 - Each note contains multiple snippets, each of the snippets is divided by a marker.
 - Each snippet's size can be a single line or multiple paragraphs.
 Each of the notes is named note<number>-<date-of-storage>.txt
 --- The draft 0 ---
 Now I'm compiling the book's draft zero out of the snippets, choosing some snippets, rejecting others from the same note.
 It's daunting to see what I've left to do and what not, while not having much of an overview of the whole thing.
 ​
 Current workflow:
 - Placing 'ACCEPTED--' in front of a snippet/org-header
 - Going over one file after another, when one is completely done with, put it folder 'done'
 - Also, when snippets are big, I make the whole note into an org file, and can have some overview.
 ​
 --- The question ---
 I'm thinking of putting each snippet in their own file (via UNIX 'sed' command) and have org-roam take care of the administration of the status (unread/accepted/rejected/need2ndview/need3rdview).
 Is this use-case something org-roam is capable of/handy for, and if not, what (package) would be advisable?
 ​
 TIA

 I know Emacs on Windows is always slow. But with 29.1, it seems much slower. Interestingly, I feel it is only slow at start-up or when you first use some function in a session. Once it is started or you have triggered the function, everything runs smoothly.
 Any idea why?

Have you ever faced compatibility issues when dealing with Linux
binary executables? The culprit is often the libc implementation,
glibc. Acting as the backbone of nearly all Linux distros,
glibc is the library responsible for providing standard C functions. Yet, its
version compatibility often poses a challenge. Binaries compiled with
a newer version of glibc may not function on systems running an older
one, creating a compatibility headache.
So, how can we circumvent this issue?
The approach we’ll focus on today involves the creation of static executables. These
executables are self-contained and do not dynamically load libc,
thereby offering enhanced portability.
However, we’re not out of the woods yet. Glibc is
not well-suited for static linking becaus…]]></summary>

 I've also been told by many around the web that it's better to start with another programming language then go to Haskell, is that true?
 And yes, I have read the sidebar, LYAH doesn't have exercise so that's a pass, Real World Haskell has barely no exercises while being quite long and seems quite advance which is also a pass from me, School of Haskell is too short, while suffering from a mixture of the last two. 
 The only three promising resources(for my learning style, which is text-based w/ exercises) Haskell from the Very Beginning by Whitington, the Haskell Wikibooks and Learn Haskell by Building a Blog Generator by Gilmi.
 Any advice regarding those resources is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How is your experience with Dap-Mode so far? Have you been able to use it as your daily development tool for debugging? If so, is it stable for you?
 ​
 Background, I failed to set it up properly a couple of times. Once I set it up, then I experienced buggy behavior (like losing connection with the debug server when stepping through the code). Today, I decided to check out its latest state and hit another bug.
 This is the only config I made for python and I am on Doom Emacs
 (require 'dap-python) (setq dap-python-debugger 'debugpy) 
 and install the server in my environment
 pip install debugpy 
 I will give it another go for this week to see if it is stable.
 EDIT: Another issue (related to doom) I just came across is company completion in dap-ui-repl doesn't work. Maybe doom is the problem :/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a situation where I am using html with blaze-html (no javascript) and I want to update a list of values.
 The form (simplified) for that update looks somewhat like this:
 ```
 <form target="_self" action="/add-entries" method="post"> <input class="input" type="number" name="id[]" required /> <input class="input" type="number" name="id[]" required /> <input class="button" type="submit" value="Eintrag erstellen" /> </form> 
 ```
 Now in the scotty code I just want to get all the ids (preferably a list of ints).
 I thought I could just use "param" and get the list of values as text, but it turned out I only got the first one.
 Code for getting the first one:
 ```
 get "/add-entries" $ do ids <- param "id[]" :: ActionM Text text ids
 ```
 Does anyone know how I can achieve getting all of them?

 ```haskell import System.IO (stdin, hReady, hSetBuffering, hSetEcho, BufferMode(NoBuffering)) import Control.Monad (when)
 main :: IO () main = do hSetBuffering stdin NoBuffering hSetEcho stdin False loop

 +--------------+---------------+ | | | | | | | | | | | | | window1 | window2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | +--------------+---------------+ | | | terminal | | | +------------------------------+ 
 When I try to open magit-status buffer with window1 or window2 active, it splits the terminal window horizontally to display it.
 How can I prevent this to happen? I want it the magit-status buffer to open in the bigger windows. If window is active, it would open in window2, and vice versa.
 I tried to use a different magit-display-buffer-function but it seems there isn't one to do that. The closest one I found would open the magit buffer over the current active buffer.
 I also tried to use winner-mode, so I could hide the terminal window before using magit-status by using winner-undo, but since I move between many windows, using the undo got confusing. Maybe there's a way to quickly toggle a window in the frame?

 My rough first draft is actually working, but the trouble is, running the AppleScript that collects the window list is very slow. It completes immediately outside of Emacs and in an Emacs shell. However, when I run it with call-process-shell-command, shell-command-to-string, or from a process started with make-process, it takes 2-5 seconds. 
 What’s happening? How can I improve the performance?
