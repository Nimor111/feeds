        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some time now I've realized that S-Space is being interpreted as just a plain old Space in my Emacs installation. For instance, C-h k S-Space will give me the help for SPC, no matter what mode I'm in, and (read-key) followed by shift and then space will give me keycode 32, the same code I get when I don't press the spacebar. 
 I can't figure out what the issue is. As far as I can tell, there is nothing relevant in my config, and emacs -Q shows the same issue. Other gtk programs can register the difference between space and shift-space. 
 Anyone have any brilliant ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on a system which uses recursion-schemes to annotate a recursive type. The annotated tree itself is pretty simple; at each level, we pair the annotation with the base functor, or
 type Annotated t a = Cofree (Base t) a 
 It's pretty straightforward to use an algebra to annotate a tree from the leaves inward:
 annotateIn :: (Base t a -> a) -> t -> Annotated t a annotateIn f = cata $ \t -> (f $ fmap extract t) :< t 
 However, I'm not quite sure how to (safely) annotate a tree from the root outward. I have to bring the annotation down the scaffolding of the existing recursive type, so I need to carry that tree along with me, something like
 annotateOut :: ((a,t) -> Base t (a,t)) -> a -> t -> Annotated t a annotateOut f = go where go a t = a :< (uncurry go <$> f (a,t))

 Context:
 Terminal: Alacritty + tmux

 Keyboard: Lily58Pro - 58 keys

 So I'm running through the tutorial, but I'm running into issues in some of the key maps ( alt key combinations ) which i3 is mapped to
 F# keys as well, grant it i haven't gone through the tutorial if those are even used yet, and I'm not to worried as they only get used only at startup ( F1 - F5 are browsers, term, files, spotify etc) so their not that important i can use rofi for that )
 Is there a way to have emacs to "hijack" or take over those keymaps while it is in focus / the active frame ? 
 is that even a thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a really good introduction to the ideas with the historical context that takes you from deforestation all the way to the stream fusion: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal/course/7480-s12/deforestation-notes.pdf
 Once you've read that, I recommend learning more about how phase control, inlining, and RULES interact: https://markkarpov.com/tutorial/ghc-optimization-and-fusion.html
 And if you're really ready to dig into the details of stream fusion there is of course Duncan Coutts's thesis: https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b4971f57-2b94-4fdf-a5c0-98d6935a44da/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe_filename=Thesis%2BPDF%252C%2Blayout%2Bfor%2Bdouble%2Bsided%2Bprinting&type_of_work=Thesis
 One important thing to keep in mind before you go off and implement anything using RULES is that RULES can be a dangerous feature if used incorrectly. You need your rules to be terminating and confluent, for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am looking email client (or web app) that supports the following two features:
  
Emacs/Vim keybindings
 Latex support
  
As far as I can tell, this does not exist. I tried a few alternatives listed below, but they don't work all that well. Also, yes I know that I could use an email client directly in emacs (Mu4e, notmuch). However, this solution has issues with html emails, and seems like overkill for such a limited set of features...
 Latex support
 MarkDownHere (https://markdown-here.com/) + Email Webapp
 This combination works pretty well, but the Latex rendering is kind of low resolution sometimes.
 Emacs/Vim Bindings
 Amazingly I could not find a single solution that really seems to nail these keybindings.
 One attempt at a solution is to enable the keybidings in the browser and then use an email webapp. The following works for Firefox:
 https://askubuntu.com/questions/245746/emacs-like-keybindings-system-wide
 But this solution is not super compatible with email webapps. For exampl, Ctrl-b enables bold on the email webapp instead of shifting the cursor back. This solution also only works for a limited set of keybidings, i.e. no kill/yank combo in emacs.
 Another possible solution is to use something like GhostText (https://github.com/fregante/GhostText) in the browser. However, this solution is unworkable because when you open up an email, all the nasty html shows up in the external editor.

 I think I developed this habit because I swapped [<->( and ]<->), and because I'm a heavy Lisp coder my pinky is almost always hovering above (. Therefore I unconsciously adapted to use ring finger to press p. However it does seem to cause lots of unnecessary hand movement.
 Does anyone else share such experience adapting to suboptimal hand positions? I guess anyone aware of this has already rebind <backspace> and <return>, but where to put (, for Lispers? I'm currently considering put it to where ; was, but there're already bunch of quite frequent bindings on ; (;, M-;, C-M-;) and it's a bit messy to move 5 frequent bindings at once (I always move anything-( together with (). It also breaks the symmetry that ( and ) sit beside each other...

It's really annoying, especially considering that it's happening without my having changed my Emacs configuration at all.
 Any leads on how to revert this behavior would be greatly appreciated. I'm on Emacs version 27.0.50, which I downloaded from https://emacsformacosx.com/, if it matters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings emacsians,
 Today my new kinesis advantage 2 keyboard arrived and I connected it in place of my old (normal layout) keyboard. Everything I've done so far seems to work, except for certain keys acting slow.
 When I hit "C-x" or "C-h", the "C-x" or "C-h" is slow to appear in the minibuffer (perhaps a half second delay). Many other keys and key combos (including "M-x", "C-g", and "C-s") seem to work/appear fast in emacs, and Vim responds quickly to "C-x", so I have no idea what could be causing this. With my old keyboard, "C-x" appeared immediately in the minibuffer after the key combo was hit so this short delay is new. It's incredibly weird that it only happens with some keys but not others, it only happens in emacs and not Vim, and it only happens with my new kinesis advantage 2 keyboard and not my all keyboard.
 Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this or how I could fix it? Any ideas or guidance would be much appreciated as I have no idea where to even start looking for the cause of the problem. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/emacs!
 So basically what the title says . I've lived vim for multiple years, and evil for many months now. I put evil in my config within first hour of using emacs because I needed to get sufficiently productive fast before I lost interest because of the alien-ness of a different ecosystem.
 I have a bit of time on my hands now and wanna invest this into getting productive with emacs keybindings, among other things. Just want to explore how things are done the emacs way.
 The motivation is more than purely exploratory, though. While evil is the best vim emulation I found, there are still small niggles and I find myself fighting a little when customising packages and keybindings. I use evil-collection and general.el, which are both awesome, btw.
 So, what words of knowledge does the community has for someone like me? I'd be grateful for tips about keybinding patterns, any good practices related to keybinding customisations etc.

I did try Spacemacs, DOOM and then decided to go with my own config for the vanilla Emacs following the great series by System Crafters on Youtube. I am now struggling with a couple of issues regarding developement with Vue JS using vue-mode or web-mode. Some features that I miss from VS Code are:
 - Auto completion for classes inside templates. (Both vue-mode and web-mode)
 - Syntax Highlighting and Auto completion for Vue specific properties such as v-mode, v-if,..etc.. since they are formatted as normal strings as they are inside Double Quotations ("). (vue-mode)
 I would like to know if other people who switched from VS Code were able to replicate those features or find alternatives, or may be point me to some tutorials or custom configs that can help. 
 I am really determined to switching to Free and Open Source Software and would like to contribute if I can in any package or project that can help people make the switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I'm messing around with some random Haskell code snippets, I'll often have my code file loaded in vscode and stack ghci running in a terminal with that file loaded. Then my workflow is:
  
Save Haskell file
 :r in ghci
  
I was looking around for a way to have ghci automatically reload the file whenever it changes. I found the following post on stackoverflow:
 https://stackoverflow.com/q/7705717/268581
 however, none of those seemed ideal.
 I've been using the following script:
 ```
 !/bin/sh
 $(while inotifywait -e close_write $1; do pkill ghc; done) &
 while inotifywait -e close_write $1 do sleep 2 stack ghci $1
 done ```
 It works, but has a couple of issues:
  
It assumes that you only have one instance of ghc running.
 For some reason, you have to save the file twice for the reload to happen.
  
I usually run it at a terminal like this:
 exec ./inotifywait-stack-ghci.hs abc.hs 
 (I posted this script in an answer to the above stackoverflow post.)
 Is there a more popular or accepted approach for doing this? Thanks for any suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone,
 I am very new to Doom Emacs, and have had good luck with getting everything to work with (csharp +lsp) in my config. So far so good, been a good experience.
 The auto format on save works great. There is just one thing, it formats braces as BSD/Allman style and my preference is K&R style braces.
 ​
 Is there a simple setting change somewhere that I just haven't found yet to set my braces preference?
 Edit:
 ------------------
 Thanks to to u/bbenne10 I found the answer to this question along with the help of this Stackoverflow post and the official documentation.
 The summary is that you place your customized settings in a file called 'omnisharp.json' in your $HOME/.omnisharp directory, then relaunch emacs. I assume this also works for any editor that uses Omnisharp-Roslyn as well.
 On re-launch and saving a file, I know have K&R/1TBS braces in my code!
 For anyone looking to do the same, my omnisharp.json file simply contains the following and nothing else.
 { "FormattingOptions": { "newLine": "\n", "useTabs": false, "tabSize": 4, "indentationSize": 4, "NewLinesForBracesInTypes": false, "NewLinesForBracesInMethods": false, "NewLinesForBracesInProperties": false, "NewLinesForBracesInAccessors": false, "NewLinesForBracesInAnonymousMethods": false, "NewLinesForBracesInControlBlocks": false, "NewLinesForBracesInAnonymousTypes": false, "NewLinesForBracesInObjectCollectionArrayInitializers": false, "NewLinesForBracesInLambdaExpressionBody": false, "NewLineForElse": false, "NewLineForCatch": false, "NewLineForFinally": false, "NewLineForMembersInObjectInit": false, "NewLineForMembersInAnonymousTypes": false, "NewLineForClausesInQuery": false, } }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am working on some elisp helper functions to aid my daily workflow. One thing i always wonder is the iteration cycle and how to make it faster.
 For example, i often want to test the function for the line at cursor, i do something like this:
 ​
 (defun foo () (some-function (thing-at-point 'line t))) 
 then i switch to the buffer with line i want to test on, but that `foo` function doesn't print.
 so i will have to add an print wrapper and later remove
 ​
 (defun foo () (interactive) (print (some-function (thing-at-point 'line t)))) 
 This get tedious quickly. I wonder what do others usually do. One way i can think of is test `some-function` directly, but then i will have to copy the string and it's hard for more dynamic cases.
 Moreover, the common iteration cycle when writing software is not something discoverable or googleable until you see how other people do it, I wonder if there is good resource or pointers on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org for (among many other things) storing recipes and tracking bakes of those recipes. I keep the ingredients in an org table using baker’s percents (where every ingredient is recorded as a percentage of the total flour), allowing me to easily scale a recipe up or down by changing only the desired total weight of the finished product. It works really well!
 Of course recipes also have an instructions section in the form of paragraphs of text. What I would love to do is combine the calculated cells from the table with this text. For example, the instructions might say, “add the 300g of softened butter to a bowl”, but if I scale the recipe, that 300g amount would change. I would want it to update either automatically when the table is recalculated, or manually by running some command. I’m sure this is possible for an elisp guru, but I’m wondering if it’s doable “out of the box” or with some additional package? Has anybody else done something similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been trying to tweak org mode's export settings for LaTeX, but I can't for the life of me find exactly what I'm looking for online (or I don't have the vocabulary to search properly).
 In short, assume the following heading structure to an org document, where I have #+latex_class set to article:
 * Heading 1 ** Heading 2 *** Heading 3 **** Heading 4 
 Currently, these are exported to .tex as:
 \section{Heading 1} \subsection{Heading 2} \subsubsection{Heading 3} \item Heading 4 
 But I would like them exported as:
 \part{Heading 1} \section{Heading 2} \subsection{Heading 3} \subsubsection{Heading 4} 
 I don't want to use \part{} directly in the document because the file is quite long (thesis-length), and I would prefer to retain subtree folding at all levels of the document.
 Any guidance would be appreciated.
 ​
 Solution
 Thanks to scbagley for pointing me to org-latex-classes. Following that lead, I stumbled across an older post on this subreddit and cobbled together a short solution.
 Here's an excerpt from my config.el:
 (use-package! org :defer true :init (with-eval-after-load 'ox-latex (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes '( "thesis" "\\documentclass{article}" ("\\part{%s}" . "\\part*{%s}") ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}") ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}") ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")))))) 
 In order to export all four heading levels as expected, I must have #+OPTIONS: H:4 set as well. Thanks to tecosaur for the clarification.
 I should have mentioned that I'm running a Doom Emacs config, so I will report for the squirrel lashing, per the rules.

 I'm in the process of moving into and learning emacs (Doom emacs). After many tutorials, I was able to set it up, make some adjustments, and within my .doom.d I uncommented the LaTeX language.
 ​
 It seems to work!
 Yet, I do not know how to compile and I can't find any info about it. It is all about org mode, yet I do not want to use that for now. I want straight up "vanilla LaTeX". How can I output the PDF?
 Thanks in advance! I have been loving emacs so far.

 I've loved Haskell for a long time but have always had trouble getting a full workflow set up. I'm primarily a c#/.net developer, so i'm used to big chunky IDEs like Visual Studio where I press a big button to install, the install "just works" without setting up any special environments or manually installing any special tools, I write code, intellisense tells me what's broken, and I press a big button to run.
 What is the closest thing to this experience for haskell?
 Looking forward to your suggestions so I can get more haskell into my caveman brain.
 Thanks, doodeoo

 I tried doing emacs -Q and using but the result is the same. Most of the time is spent on Reading <page-url-here>... phase, takes at least 3 seconds. Then it shows Rendering... and Fontifying... phases on the echo area. Rendering... takes ~1-2 seconds and Fontifying... is near instant. I guess the process communication should introduce a bit latency but ~3 seconds is just too much. 
 Anybody have any ideas how to speed things up or is this the way w3m package works?
 Just to note, I know about the eww package and I use it but w3m's rendering is just better and I would like to be able to use it.
 I'm using the latest version of the package (20210615.103 from MELPA) and I tested it in both emacs 27.2 and 28.0.50.

 Can anyone point me to some info about what I need to tweak to have these work the other way round? 
 So I want option to behave as Meta, and Cmd to be available for use as a modifier. 
 Note: when I run emacs without being in an xterm, it's working the way I want (i.e., within iTerm or Mac terminal).

I'm fascinated by the question how a zettelkasten can support creative processes. My zettel shows one of the approaches I am experimenting with.
The basic idea is the following: I collect ideas triggered by the question "How can inventive principles from the TRIZ method be used to make zettelkasten work more interesting, successful or effective?" Background: TRIZ is the "theory of inventive problem solving", and one of its key components is a list of 40 (or so) inventive principl…]]></summary>

 If you type zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ID in your browser, Zotero opens the pdf of the item specified with ID.
 I want to be able to click on this link in my org file and have it opened. However, when I insert [[http://zotero://open-pdf/library/items/][A pdf]] in the org file, it doesn't work, and the address in the browser's address bar doesn't contain the colon after "zotero" and before "//" and the link is changed to zotero//open-pdf/library/items/ID which doesn't open Zotero and therefore the pdf.
 I also tried removing the HTTP:// and using [[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/][A pdf]] but emacs asks to create a heading and doesn't open the browser at all.
 I would appreciate it if you could tell me how should I insert this type of link in my org file so it doesn't change it when opens the browser.
 Thanks!

 I can see from org's source code that the manual is in fact one big .org file.
 How do I configure org's publishing options to make my big .org file into many files, like org's manual?
 EDIT 1: It seems that the manual is made with Texinfo (texi). Now my question is: how can I best go from .org -> texi -> the html format I see in the docs?
 EDIT 2: I found my answer. First, export from org to texi.
 Then, use makeinfo to build the html. For example: makeinfo --no-validate --force book.texi --html -o book
 The command above will produce a directory called book/ containing an index.html, with each heading a separate HTML file.
 I should be able to take it from here with org publishing configuration. Thanks all for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my LaTeX projects, I usually have one file main.tex and sub-directories including other tex files which are ultimately included in then main.tex. The way AUCTeX handles this is by setting TeX-master to point to main. Instead of setting this variable locally in each file, I used to have a ".dir-locals" file in each sub-directory to set TeX-master.
 Since dir-local variables are inherited, I wanted to make it so that I can set TeX-master in the root directory once for all files. For example, having the following structure:
  - main.tex - sub1.tex - .dir-locals.el - sub/ |-- subsub1.tex |-- subsub2.tex |-- subsub |-- subsubsub1.tex |-- subsubsub2.tex 
 and then have in .dir-locals.el 
 lisp ((latex-mode . ((TeX-master relpath "main")))) 
 Then in both main.tex and sub1.tex, TeX-master would main but in subsub*.tex, TeX-master would be ../main, and subsubsub*.tex TeX-master would be ../../main and so on.
 Having an eval statement would not work since I wouldn't be able to get the path to the directory. The way I solved this is by advising hack-local-variables-filter to handle this particular value.
 What do you think of this solution? Comments on my lisp-fu are also welcome.
  (define-advice hack-local-variables-filter (:around (old-fn variables dir-name) replace-rel-path) (let ((new-variables (if dir-name (mapcar (lambda (x) (let ((val (cdr x))) (if (and (consp val) (eq (car val) 'relpath)) (cons (car x) (file-relative-name (concat (file-name-as-directory dir-name) (cadr val)))) x))) variables) variables))) (funcall old-fn new-variables dir-name)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[dotty-cps-async 9.0 https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async is published on maven central (actually a few days ago, but during the week it was hard to manage time to write announce),
 What was changed since 1-st public release in the version, which is available for scala3 final:
 Main points behind bug fixing:
  
Implemented async variants for most high-order functions from scala standard library; Now, if you use await inside for loop or fold -- usually, it just works.
 The simplified setting of shifted version of high-order functions: now developer can declare one in place, instead of creating an extra typeclass.
 
Implemented custom call-chain builders: I.e., the following expression
  
 for( url <- urls if await(score(url)) > 0) yield await(fetch(url))  will traverse through urls only once because we can merge filter and map in
 WithFilter call-chain builder.
  
Implemented support of automatic coloring:
  
I.e., we can write something like:
  async { val auth = db.retrieveAuth(url) val data = fetchData(auth,URL) if (isInteresting(data)) then db.increaseScoring(url) } 
 And the compiler will insert needed awaits automatically.
 This works not only for plain Futures but also for effect monads, such as cats-effects IO, Monix, and ZIO. (see article about this: https://github.com/rssh/notes/blob/master/2021_06_27_automatic-coloring-for-effects.md )
  
ScalaJS:
  
Implemented support for non-monadic objects in awaited statements (i.e., `js. Promise`) - now it is possible to use await(js.Promise) inside an async block.
 Implemented JSFuture, which looks like 'promise' from the js side, but as typed monad on scala side.
 
  
Also, during the year passed from the 0.1 version, we tested it in few internal projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day
 I'm very new to Haskell and trying to write a simple game for practice. I'm trying to figure out an alternative approach with an element of the game, and I was looking for suggestions. Ideally, your suggestion should not be too advanced for a newbie and relatively easy to grok. :)
 The element of the game in question I am seeking help with is something I call Snapshot, which essentially just captures the number of every resource in the game at a certain point in time.
 Existing code:
 data Resource = Wood | Wheat | Person | Stone | Gold | Weapons deriving (Show, Ord, Eq) data Snapshot = Snapshot { resources :: [(Int, Resource)], buildings :: [(Int, Building)] } 
 As it is, each part of the program that creates or reads a Snapshot validates which resources are contained in the lis…]]></summary>

 Total beginner here, I followed this tutorial to create a major mode for a scripting language that I need to use sometimes in my petroleum engineering work, its working great for me now, having different colors for different kinds of keywords makes editing and reading the file a lot easier, but when editing python scripts I have the ability to fold the classes or functions to easily navigate the code, and I have a list of all classes and functions using imenu-list, how can I add this feature to my custom made major mode? 
 Below is the code I assembled from the tutorial mentioned above:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I use C-SPC or C-x b to switch to another buffer, my Dired buffer has an exclamation mark in front of it. Here's an image of it.
 I'm not sure why it appears, but I assume it is to show it (or the buffer) is modified? I think it appeared after I marked a file for deletion in the Dired buffer with d and then deleted it with x.
 Sadly, I was not able to find anything while searching around. Google's search operators absolutely hate trying to search for a !. Even when doing stuff like intext:("! Dired") or allintext:("! Dired"), the AND operator didn't help much either. Not even the <string> +<string> operator worked, which is supposed to force an exact match. I also tried to search for more generalized strings, because that's what the search engine is built more towards nowadays, but even with a verbose 'exclamation mark' did not help me much.
 Thus, I gave up and came here. I am rather new to Emacs, so if it is something obvious, I have either missed it or just plain don't know about it. All help is appreciated :)

 If so then it would be great to talk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, wanted to raise a discussion about a thought I had. 
 As a moderately experienced Emacs user (8 years), I've invested a LOT of time into learning and configuring Emacs (including email, RSS, browsing, calculator, etc). I can say that it does what I want and how I want it. I won't go into the fact that it's a never ending process because tastes and interests (+ jobs) change. 
 I would reckon that we all stick to Emacs, at least in some small part due to the sunk cost fallcy. Basically it means a price already paid in the past on our actions keep influencing our decisions in the future even though it shouldn't. From the link: 
  
People demonstrate "a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made."
  
The question of whether the time invested in Emacs is worth the productivity gained is discussed here all the time. My view is to justify it by a combination of the following: believing in FOSS, (related to that) text centricity, and it could be viewed as a mental hobby, a creative outlet. 
 However I might admit that I exhibit some sunk cost fallacy thinking. It becomes clear when I realize that I WON'T recommend Emacs to new users - unless they are going to invest large amounts of time learning it, like I did. 
 What are your thoughts on this? would you admit that there's some irrational thinking in choosing Emacs over some other tools, e.g. the longer you use it the more you're convinced it's the best even though new tools are keep being developed.

 I tried various combinations of deft-strip-title-regex and deft-strip-summary-regex trying to remove the unwanted parts, but without success.
 Anyone had the same problem and has a solution for this? Or maybe an alternative for full text searching and narrowing the notes like deft does?

 Scala does have the for(i <- 0 until 100) notation, which is even better, but comes at a great cost of boxing and is not suitable when performance is important.
 In Scala3 this could be fixed.
 In Scalqa, the Int <> (range), when used in simple "for-comprehension" with .foreach logic, gets treated with some macro magic :

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a tip a lot of you are sure to know about, but it just made my day. pdf-tools has a dark mode called "midnight mode".
 It can be activated with C-c C-r m – or M-x pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode if you can't remember the keybinding.
 What's more, there is even an associated variable, pdf-view-midnight-colors, which lets you set the foreground and background color of the render. In init.el I just put
 (setq pdf-view-midnight-colors '("#f8f8f2" . "#282a36")) 
 and now PDF looks at home with Dracula my theme of choice.

 I have a simple function : 
 func :: IO String func = let passed = -- some func that return IO Bool in let result = (\x -> if x then "passed" else "failed") <$> passed in result 
 ` So, how can I bind the return value of func to some variable say, var :: IO String?
 Or this can't be done or should not to be done? Writing var = func won't work. 
 I am a beginner in Haskell and FP overall so sorry if it sounds stupid. And another thing, why can't I write something like "let passed = IO True"? 
 A better qn would be how to put Bool inside IO context?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've made my own Emacs theme where I only use the 16 standard and bright Terminal colors. I have my colors defined like this:
  (defvar theme-colors-alist '(("black" . "black") ("red" . "red") ("green" . "green") ("yellow" . "yellow") ("blue" . "blue") ("magenta" . "magenta") ("cyan" . "cyan") ("white" .

"brightmagenta") ("brightcyan" . "brightcyan") ("brightwhite" . "brightwhite") ) "terminal colors.") 
 However, GUI emacs seems to only have the standard colors defined, not the bright colors. There is no "brightred". I did some research and found out that the GUI gets its colors from rbg.txt which is an X11 specific file, and that it does not define those colors.
 So I'm wondering how I can handle this. Maybe there is a way to change the value of these mappings if emacs is running in GUI mode so I can map the bright colors to hex values or other colors?

This was the third problem I ran into and it wasn't obvious to me how to solve it. What is the simplest way you can solve this problem in Haskell? I honestly found it a bit discouraging to have such difficulty with a problem that I could solve easily in other languages.
 Here's the problem:
 Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if: Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order. Example 1: Input: s = "()" Output: true Example 2: Input: s = "()[]{}" Output: true Example 3: Input: s = "(]" Output: false Example 4: Input: s = "([)]" Output: false

 (use-package bookmark+ :demand :custom (bookmark-version-control t) (bookmark-save-flag 1) (delete-old-versions t) :after bookmark) 
 I do use no-littering that doesn't appear to be hiding anything. ~/.emacs.d/var/bmkp/current-bookmark.el contains my bookmarks. Thats the only file there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get org capture to create a headline based on the name of the current project I'm working on. That way I can quickly capture a todo for that project, and then later on I can visit my projects.org file and each project will have it's own heading, i.e.:
 * ~/path/to/project_1 ** Some todos * ~/path/to/project_2 ** Some todos 
 This is what I have:
 (defun my-org-capture () (interactive) (setq my-project-name (project-root (project-current))) (call-interactively #'org-capture)) (setq org-capture-templates '(("p" "Project TODO" entry (file+headline "~/path/to/projects.org" my-project-name) "* TODO %? %^g\n%a") )) 
 I would expect this code to get the project root path, store it in my-project-name, and insert it as the headline in the capture template. Instead I get the error Wrong type argument: stringp, my-project-name.
 I'm aware I can manually do this by manually creating a headline for each project and refiling the captures correspondingly, but if possible I'd like to "automate" that away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been have this issue ever since I switched to emacs28 with native comp. If I try to open a file directly in the terminal version of emacs (e.g. emacs -nw filename), emacs won't open the file -- instead I get an error message saying: Symbol’s value as variable is void: \213, and a blank buffer.
 As far as I can tell, emacs works normally after that, and I can open the file with C-x C-f but it's a bit of an annoyance. The --debug-init option gives no additional output. 
 This only happens with the -nw option. The gui works normally. 
 Anybody know what's going on here?
 PS: I'm on MacOS and using the emacs-plus distribution from Homebrew.
 EDIT: After some investigation it turns out the following code inside my init.el file was the issue: 
 (defvar startup/file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist) (setq file-name-handler-alist nil) (defun startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist () (setq file-name-handler-alist startup/file-name-handler-alist)) (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook 'startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist) 
 Anybody know why this would cause the error on emacs28?

 I would like to create a minor mode so that when I'm editing text or org files, every instance of the word "clock" will be replaced by "HH:MM" which would represent the current time and would be updated every minute to stay accurate. 
 Is there a way to either have the buffer pull clock times every minute or for some sort of clock to push updates to a buffer every minute to trigger rerendering? 
 I'm not too sure on what to look for in the emacs docs to find what I need so any guidance would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So. I can't say compile-time reflection and code generation is bad. But. When porting existing code to Scala3, I found out compile-time reflection has some issues hampering my productivity.
 - Compile-time reflection API is much more complex than runtime reflection API
 - new reflection API is badly documented and behaves weirdly in corner cases
 - Compile-time reflection is impossible to debug, logging is all you have.
 - Compile-time reflection is pain to test, incremental compilation does not track macros so I have to rebuild every time.
 Summarizing, runtime reflection is huge boost in productivity for complex cases. Writing some tests is much easier (faster, simpler code, less maintenance) than getting compile-time reflection to work.
 Soooo.... Any signs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm moving my CV to org mode, exported to latex. I use org headlines as headings, and then plain lists and text for the body. I had previously kept the whole thing in latex, and have a format which I'm really happy with. I'm turning that into a custom class, which I will use in the export.
 Some of the headings have dates attached to them. The class file I've made redefines the the LaTeX section command to have two arguments: \\section{<date>}{<heading title>}.
 The most obvious way I can see to store these associated dates in org mode is in a property, like :DATE: 2018. 
 Is there a way that I can inject these property's values into the section strings in the export? The only similar functionality I have found so far is the strings in the third argument of org-latex-classes, but that only interpolates the heading title, and doesn't provide any way of getting further information into the string.
 If this is just not possible at the moment, would anybody else be interested in it if I were to try to implement it?

But I would like to use the language also for quick, exploratory work and small scripts. For that it seems to be unnecessary complicated to create a .cabal and a stack.yaml file. Instead I would like to maintain a global set of packages that are just available when I open ghci in my terminal.
 Both cabal and stack seem to be able to install Haskell packages globally. I'm a bit lost, though, which setup is more convenient and where the pitfalls are. I was hoping some more experienced Linux users could share their experiences (I'm on Manjaro and Ubuntu).

 It'd be nice to be able to include it in a similar fashion of how you can do it with noweb yes in the same file, rather than having to duplicate the code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I was switched on to fancy-dabbrev from the post: Package praise: Prodigy and fancy-dabbrev 
 Having completions preview in a way that can be quickly accepted without blocking input is great (as I'm now used to in fish).
 However fairly quickly I ran into some annoyances/functionality that wasn't working as I needed.
 I've since submitted some PR's which Joel Rosdahl has been kind enough to review & apply.
  
Only complete when a preview is visible (fall-back to tab action) - so tab doesn't complete when I don't expect it to.
 Configurable tab action (command to fall back to when completion isn't used).
 The message buffer is no longer flooded with noisy dabbrev progress reports.
 Fix for exiting fancy-dabbrev-mode leaving preview visible.
  
Highly recommend giving this package a look.
 My configuration:
 (use-package fancy-dabbrev :commands (fancy-dabbrev-mode) :config (setq fancy-dabbrev-preview-delay 0.1) (setq fancy-dabbrev-preview-context 'before-non-word) (setq fancy-dabbrev-expansion-on-preview-only t) (setq fancy-dabbrev-indent-command 'tab-to-tab-stop) (define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd "<tab>") 'fancy-dabbrev-expand-or-indent)) 
 Since I find these kinds of packages a little intrusive (with pre/post commands that run on each key-stroke), I only enable this in evil-insert mode.
 ;; Only while in insert mode. (with-eval-after-load 'evil (add-hook 'evil-insert-state-entry-hook (lambda () (fancy-dabbrev-mode 1))) (add-hook 'evil-insert-state-exit-hook (lambda () (fancy-dabbrev-mode 0))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's Wolfram, MatLab, Python, R -- and now Julia roaring to the fore. What about Haskell for numerical analysis, as a computer algebra system? There seem to be many sundry things on Hackage, Wiki, etc. for math, but scant documentation -- unless you want to read skeleton-ish data type source and puzzle out what's going on, what might be going on once fleshed out.
 Just this beginner's delvings indicate to me that Haskell would make as good a CAS as any other language. Not that I'm qualified to make a final decision. While doing math with other leading languages has many thick textbooks, I only know of 2-1/2 books (one is SML-based), all dealing (quite well) with discrete math. Am I missing something? Did I arrive at the conversation late? Why doesn't Haskell have a nice, big chunk of CAS and numerical analysis?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Property Based Testing (PBT) the programmer specifies desirable properties or invariants for the code under test, and uses a test framework to generate random inputs to find counter-examples.
For example, “a reversed list has the same size as the original list” which can be written as:
fun l -> List.length (List.reverse l) = List.length l

Imagine this test fails for the list [42; 9079086709; -148; 9; -9876543210].
Does this counter-example fail the test because there are 5 elements? Or because there are negative numbers? Or maybe due to the big numbers?
Many reasons are possible.
To help narrow down the cause of test failures, most PBT libraries provide a feature called shrinking.
The idea is that once a test fails for a given input, the test engine will try less complex inputs, to fin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I want to have a todo block in org-agenda with the most immediate deadline items first, followed by items without deadlines, like
 proj1: TODO 2021-08-18 foo proj2: TODO 2021-08-19 bar proj3: TODO foobar proj4: TODO baz 
 However, setting (org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(deadline-up)) puts items without deadlines first, like:
 proj3: TODO foobar proj4: TODO baz proj1: TODO 2021-08-18 foo proj2: TODO 2021-08-19 bar 
 And of course, setting 'deadline-down puts later deadlines first, then closer deadlines, then items without deadlines, which isn't what I want either.
 How would I go about ordering a todo block in the desired order of closer deadlines->further deadline->entries without deadlines. It seems like org should have a built in way to do it, but will I have to write something custom to get it working as expected?

If I open up calctex via M-x calc, then inputting anything freezes emacs. However, if I run the embedded-calc, then it works perfectly fine. 
 I'm using emacs-mac on an m1 MacBook, but the same issue occurs with emacs-28. I'm using BasicTex installed via home-brew as my tex distribution, and all required packages are installed via tlmgr. 
 Note that I've already put tecosaur's fix for dvichop in my config: https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html#calc-calctex 
 Is there anything else I'm missing?

Edward Kmett pointed out to me that the Reflection without Remorse paper covers this in depth as well as provides a solution. In the paper, sequences, such as sequences of binds are reified into type aligned sequences. This makes it cheap to inspect them without reassociating the binds. Thus getting rid of the quadratic slowdown incurred by inspecting the sequence. There is a downside in that the constant factors are worse.

 /home/joebloggs/websites/www.domain.com/www/html.
 The idea is to create a table of the kind
 | user | website | |-----------+---------------------| | joebloggs | www.domain.com | | janesmith | www.fancydomain.net | 
 etc.
 If I replicate the root directory in two columns then in one of them the search and replace should delete the /home/ and /websites/www.domain.com/www/html in ther user column and in the website column the search and replace would delete /home/joebloggs/websites/ and /www/html.
 I'm sure there are fancier methods but I would prefer it to be a sequence of regular search and replace using the vi syntax, ie :<,>s/xxx/yyy/g in the minibuffer but use regexes to match the relevant parts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While messing around with a mundane Bash utility, I had a realization - the way I write Bash is primitive beyond Python's level of interactivity - where I can hit C-c C-c to reload the buffer's definitions in the prompt and otherwise execute newly-defined code piecemeal - let alone Lisp(s).
 This wasn't noteworthy earlier because "shell isn't a serious language" and nothing I write is more than ~100 lines I think, yet I, in sum, probably have written more of it than anything. (because the terminal is the terminal and it gets things done, day after day) Easing the transition from (increasingly lengthy and arcane) a la carte invocations to standalone scripts would be among the more productive uses of time for extending Emacs.
 I use vterm as my primary terminal, and generally re-execute the whole script as a unit, as if it were in a edit-compile-debug cycle. How can I make the setup more SLIME-like?

 Has anybody been able to do this?

 after having tested both MPDel and EMMS, I came to like the first more. One thing bumps me out, though. It has some very long key prefix (C-x Z), and I cannot change it.
 Whenever I try to set it - either in use-package, or outside of use-package, using (setq mpdel-prefix-key (kbd "s-m")) - it comes up with an error saying: package.el mpdel failed to define keymap mpdel-prefix-key. And this is strange because in the beginning of mpdel.el (using M-. on the mpdel package), one of the first things defined is (defcustom mpdel-prefix-key ...).
 Is anyone else here using mpdel and has encountered similar issues? 
 Otherwise, any tips/suggestions welcome.
 Thanks a bunch, have a good day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks 
 I am proud to release a project, which took me a decade to develop (though first 5 years I worked in Java). There are many new ideas and Scala3 became the ingenious technology to make them happen.
 Scalqa stands for 'Scala Quick API'. It is built around fast proprietary collections, which support unboxed processing of primitive types.
 It also provides a standardized way to define opaque data based on Java primitives. Data elements naturally inherit built-in specialized collections.
 A simple J.Benchmark test
 import scalqa.{*, given} val array: Array[Int] = (1 to 1000).toArray J.Benchmark( ("Array", () => array .map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 == 0).sum), ("Iterator", () => array.iterator.map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 == 0).sum), ("Scalqa Stream", () => array.~ .map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 == 0).sum), ) 
 yields output
 Final Result. Total length is about 12 secs --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- Num Name Ops/Sec % Memory % Avg Value --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- 1 Array 29.8k 30 97.6kB 100 250500.0 2 Iterator 27.3k 28 45.9kB 47 250500.0 3 Scalqa Stream 97.4k 100 517B 0 250500.0 --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- 
 Memory consumption clearly indicates unboxed processing.
 The value proposition is: Scalqa is much simpler and faster than general language API. Also, one can immediately be efficient with opaque types, which otherwise would take long time to get right.
 The project feature set is complete, but any good ideas (based on feedback) will still be taken in before version 1.0 in late Fall.
 Any discussion will be appreciated, for larger questions please use the new GitHub discussions feature.
 PS. The documentation is still "work in progress", sorry for any inconsistencies you might come across.

Variable / function names don't start with the thing it operates on (mark-, buffer- etc..) and functions are named haphazardly, so it's almost impossible to discover functions while programming without having to refer to the guide (which also sucks)....
 So I'd like to ask if there were any efforts to wrap the standard library and provide a sensible api ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing that's kept Emacs in Evil Mode, and Vim before it, from being a fully functioning text editor for me was that I couldn't use it extensively for Korean writing projects due to the need to shift manually to Korean input when entering insert mode.
 (Yes I did the tutorial and gave the default Emacs keybinds a try for a while. I'm glad I know them but they weren't for me.)
 Recently I redefined the evil-insert function to add toggle-korean-input-method to the end, and this achieved what should be the default behavior for Vim/Evil Mode imo, switching the language input method to what it was before leaving input mode last time.
 I won't reproduce the whole redefined function since all I did was repeat the whole function in my init.el while adding one line after (evil-insert-state 1), like this:
 (evil-insert-state 1) (toggle-korean-input-method) )) 
 The obvious solution might have been to advise the function, which was the first thing I tried but it resulted in breaking the evil-insert function. Here's the advice I tried:
 (advice-add 'evil-insert :after #'toggle-korean-input-method) 
 Maybe I did it wrong but it made Evil Mode unusable, and the Emacs manual says advising a function called by other functions is is bad practice so I went with redefinition, clunky though it is.
 Frankly I don't entirely understand why this works the way it does, but it's made me very happy and maybe it'll be helpful to others :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do I remap my modifier keys so that right shift is super, right control is meta, right alt is hyper, and left alt is alt?
 I'm using Windows and GNU Emacs.
 EDIT: Got something working. It's hacky af, but it's something. In my .emacs file:
 (setq w32-pass-apps-to-system nil) (setq w32-apps-modifier 'super) (setq w32-scroll-lock-modifier 'alt) (setq w32-pass-rwindow-to-system nil) (setq w32-rwindow-modifier 'hyper) (w32-register-hot-key [H-]) 
 And in AutoHotKey (AHK):
 ScrollLock:: While GetKeyState("ScrollLock", "P") { SetScrollLockState, On } SetScrollLockState, Off Return PrintScreen:: While GetKeyState("PrintScreen", "P") { SetScrollLockState, On } SetScrollLockState, Off Return RShift:: if WinActive("emacs@DESKTOP-FOO") { Send, {AppsKey down} } else { Send, {RShift down} Return } Return RShift up:: if WinActive("emacs@DESKTOP-FOO") { Send, {AppsKey up} } else { Send, {RShift up} Return } Return 
 I tried to remap Right Win to Right Control, but Emacs can't intercept it. It can intercept the real key, but not the artificial one. That means I have to use my pinkies, but it's not the end of the world because my pinkies only have to move up one row to hit the two Right Wins. 
 I think that's good for now; after all, I can chain them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider this newtype:
 newtype Stacked f a = Stacked { unStacked :: forall r. f r -> f (a, r) } deriving Functor 
 With this you can define an Applicative instance for any Functor:
 instance Functor f => Applicative (Stacked f) where pure x = Stacked (fmap (x,)) Stacked p <*> Stacked q = Stacked (fmap (\(f, (x, y)) -> (f x, y)) . p . q) 
 Here the tuples that are returned form a sort of stack which can be pushed to as in the pure function and popped as in the definition of <*>.
 I found this pattern in the future parsers described in Section 4.6 of "Combinator parsing: a short tutorial". Their Pf st a is coercible to Stacked (ReaderT st Steps) a.
 Does this newtype already exist in some library?
 This also reminds me a bit of monoidal functors. Is there some connection to category theory here?

I recently installed emacs and doom-emacs and I wanted to make doom-emacs ready for python development just like pycharm or vscode with autocompletions and code navigations atleast. So, I followed this link from the official documentation and installed mspyls as the language server for emacs. It did work and it does give me autocompletion for the inbuilt modules but for third party libraries like pandas and numpy it gives me a :
 unable to import pandas/numpy [import-error] 
 I've install pyenv in emacs for pyenv-mode as well as installed pyenv in my machine. I've activated the environment through emacs and emacs shows the name of the environment as well as the version of python in the bottom right corner. I've also installed pandas and numpy in that environment but emacs is not able to recognize the packages.
 Screenshot of emacs with pyenv:

 Also, I've tried some other links like this where packages like pyvenv is suggested. Although I've managed to install pyvenv and also create/activate the virtual environment from it and also install pandas and numpy in the virtual environment, emacs is not able to import third party packages.

 My question is how are b and c being compared, if they are different case classes ? Does scala assume they are of the same type ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've discovered that Emacs and/or Org-Mode is a "rabbit hole" (there's an actual post about this in this group). 
 ​
 <Insert obligatory experience disclosure here> : I'm not an expert at either Emacs or Org-mode. 
 But Org-mode and Emacs are both very large systems, and sometimes I feel like they really are so large, and so complex - that there is a trap, of tinkering with E/O and never getting anything done (of value-add). 
 However - playing devil's advocate - building / configuring org-mode / emacs is alot like building your own light saber / becoming a jedi: incredibly powerful tools / processes, but in the wrong hands, they are worthless, or dangerous. Only when used correctly can they help you actually get real work done. 
 It hasn't taken me long to figure out that the only real way to "master" (use competently) org-mode/emacs is to just dive in, figure out what YOU want out of your management system, and go for it. 
 if you find your self at a dead end, it's probably not a limitation of the system, but a limitation on your specificity of your goal / problem. 
 However complex, labyrinth-ian both systems get, they will never be outpaced by other "note taking " apps . 
 Why? 
 ​
 because org-mode and emacs are both more about the processing of text than simply note-taking. 
 ​
 I really think that the future of org-mode however, is to move away from some of the architectural constraints of emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, this is my first serious attempt at making something in Haskell and I'd really appreciate any feedback you might have, be it whether something is not idiomatic Haskell or if there's a simpler/better way to accomplish something. https://github.com/osoleve/Name-QuickSearch
 The purpose of the tool is to allow for fast matching of names (or other short natural language strings) against another set of names using fuzzy similarity metrics, letting you get, say, the highest scoring name out of a set of hundreds of thousands using Jaro-Winkler in under a second. Most of the speed is achieved using a token-matching heuristic, where the similarity scores are only computed between pairs of names sharing an entire token, with token inventories being precomputed and stored in a hashmap.
 It works pretty much exactly as I want so far, but as a Haskell beginner I'm sure there are improvements that can be made, and I figured this would be a good place to ask.
 Thanks in advance!

 I'm new to emacs and I just installed ivy, counsel, swiper, flycheck, paredit and the base company packages. I think all that is left is an auto-completion package (if there are other stuff I might need but don't know, please say so).
 In my search for auto-completion packages, I came across rtags, irony, ycmd and cquery, I've seen comments about rtags and irony not being good for large projects (although rtags can handle larger projects than irony). I've also heard that rtags wouldn't work if there are many errors and that there were some problems when the irony server was up for long. I visited ycmd's repo, and it seems to now be unmaintained: abingham/emacs-ycmd: Emacs client for ycmd, the code completion system. (github.com) 
 Many people said that they were interested in cquery, but most of what I found was from a few years back, so I just wanted to ask how far have these packages come? can I use a combination of them at once? are there stuff that one is better at than the rest at?
 Thanks in advance!

However, the formatting requirements have left me stuck writing papers in LibreOffice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm doing some programming exercises from a site called exercism, because even simple programming problems can be fun and give you an opportunity to learn things. One of the exercises is about detecting anagrams in a list.
 There are lots of ways to do it, but decided to try something that was less about manually iterating through the characters in a word myself and more about using built-in functionality.
 (defun anagrams-for (word anagram-list) (cl-loop for drow in anagram-list with tmp-drow = drow unless (equal (downcase word) (downcase drow)) do (setq tmp-drow drow) unless (cl-mismatch (cl-sort word '< :key 'downcase) (cl-sort drow '< :key 'downcase)) collect tmp-drow)) 
 First, that with tmp-drow = drow absolutely does not work as I expect. The cl-loop is supposed to set variables in a let* manner, but when that with is called, drow is still unset. That's why I do the setq later.
 Second, cl-sort is destructive, so I thought I'd be able to copy the value into tmp-drow and avoid the rearranging of pointers that it performs. However, that's not the case. Is there a way to explicitly make a copy of the data, not just what's being pointed to?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When defining a custom record type to match some table, I sometimes want to use record field types other than the default ones assumed by opaleye.
 E.g. for a (Field SqlNumeric), I don't want to use a Scientific in the Haskell record type when the scale of the postgresql NUMERIC field is 0; it makes more sense to use Integer instead of Scientific. Similarly, if a column is of a domain that constrains the value to be non-negative, it may make more sense to use an unsigned type such as Word64 instead of Int64.
 Consider the following code:  data Rec' a b = Rec { a :: a, b :: b } type Rec1 = Rec' Scientific Scientific type Rec2 = Rec' Integer Integer type RecField = Rec' (Field SqlNumeric) (Field SqlNumeric) $(makeAdaptorAndInstance "pRec" ''Rec') recTable :: Table RecField RecField recTable = table "rec" (pRec Rec { a = tableField "a", b = tableField "b" }) 
 If I try to use selectTable recTable and runSelect to read a [Rec1] it's fine, but if I try to read a [Rec2], I get a compilation error (No instance for (Opaleye.Internal.RunQuery.DefaultFromField SqlNumeric Integer). How can I simply map the table to a record type that uses Integer instead of Scientific without adding much boilerplate? I only need to read the tables, not write to them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have used lsp mode with web mode along with some other minor modes for web app developments. But the performance was too bad for me, of course i don't have a state of art computer (pretty old one actually), but thats really no excuse for pure performance, by poor performance i meant ram usage, speed, processor usage etc. For example when working on a react project in typescript (tsx created by CRA), the ram usage increased up to several gb and eventually or immediate there were input lags and really slow and sluggish performance. meanwhile i found vscode very performant on same machine on same project. lsp isn't slow for any other mode, i use it frequently for go, python, c/c++, they work smoothly. Then i tried out tide in web mode, and boy it was a good change. tide works out of the box, very well, fast enough and it didn't eat up so much ram either. i am not very familiar to elisp tracebacks, so just moved on to tide, instead of going deeper. i feel somewhat guilty for that, but i just don't know where to start or where to look at, cause lsp-mode code is huge and i don't know where to begin.
 Anyway, did anyone else have this problem? If so, did you find any solution? I looked into the git issues but not much luck. I am liking tide very much, great project.
 If you are wondering about my emacs configs here they are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using emacs and org-mode at work for note taking and task management. Until now I've used my own laptop for this and it's been working very well. I'm also looking to integrate org-roam in my workflow as soon as v2 is stable.
 We've only recently been handed work laptops, so currently I'm travelling with both laptops, which is not really convenient. As the work laptop (Windows 10) is heavily secured (no admin access, no installs of apps in user context either, lots of security-related logging and alerts, ssh client disabled), I guess that the only way to use emacs on this thing is over https (which is monitored as well, mind you). I do have experience with self-hosting some stuff on my own domain, so I'm looking for a web application I can self-host which allows me to use emacs over a web browser.
 There are many pieces of information about this, such as
  
shell apps: gotty, web-console, gateone, shellinabox, butterfly, webssh: most seem no longer maintained and there's no clear indication regarding conflicts with key mappings between the browser/app and emacs ;
 more specific emacs/orgmode apps: cloudmacs, organice, orgmodweb, filestash, org-web: they are more limited by nature, but I might use them if they have support for custom agenda views which I use heavily ;
 the use of chrome web app mode or spacemacs to resolve the keymapping problem.
  
So, before going through each and every combination, or having to torture my muscle memory, does anybody have a thorough (and positive) experience of using emacs, or at least org-mode, in a browser on a daily basis ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I'm fairly new to org-mode, and have just been familiarizing myself with the basics for the past few days. After going through some excellent posts, I decided to try out org-mode for taking down and organizing lecture notes, and thought I could first try it out on a MOOC that I am taking.
 Now to the real question. As someone who has always taken down notes on paper using a pen, I do not plan to move away from it, and infact would like to org-mode to supplement it. Being a grad student in Computer Science, and Engineering, I realize that apart from taking down notes on a paper, I would need to annotate PDFs, to add notes that, have blocks of code from different stages at different points in the notes.
 Thus, I may potentially have upto 5 sources of notes (yes, seems like a lot): (i) a majority on pen-paper, (ii) annotations in a PDF, (iii) normal notes and points in a normal org-mode text window, and (iv) blocks of code and (v) diagrams. Is there a good way to combine these different sources in org-mode and make it seem streamlined and efficient? Essentially, a good workflow for me to add pdf's and diagrams/code to my pen-paper notes and organize them. Is it even feasible, as I am still fairly new to org-mode?
 Breaking it to a simpler need, what is the best workflow to integrate lecture slides (with annotations) with handwritten notes? 
 Note: Please don't provide answers such as "Just listen in class don't take notes constantly, or you will miss out", it doesn't for me. I'm someone who relies on writing a lot to understand information, and pen-paper notes has worked well for me. I would love to supplement it with other sources to make it better :)
 Edit: I have come across org-noter, and though I find it to be cool, I don't understand most of it, and it seems for a pro-org-mode user! If someone does suggest it, I'd highly appreciate it if someone explains what it does for a noob user.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use spacemacs with a ton of packages and memory-report says this:
 ``` Estimated Emacs Memory Usage
 65.8 MiB Overall Object Memory Usage 26.8 MiB Reserved (But Unused) Object Memory 12.1 MiB Memory Used By Global Variables 6.7 MiB Memory Used By Symbol Plists 1.3 MiB Total Buffer Memory Usage 0.0 KiB Total Image Cache Size
 Object Storage
 25.7 MiB Vectors 18.2 MiB Strings 17.9 MiB Conses 3.0 MiB Symbols 1.1 MiB Intervals 22.3 KiB Buffer-Objects 6.3 KiB Floats ```
 A quick glance tells me that's <200MiB which sounds about right.
 However, top reports Emacs as using ~583MiB in total and this climbs to gigabytes over the course of a few days. Emacs never uses this memory more than once because it's almost always swapped out.
 I have disabled GC because it makes Emacs a stuttery mess but I set up a trigger set up to GC whenever Emacs loses focus (which is often) and doing a manual GC doesn't change anything about Emacs' RAM usage.
 This is happening on both Linux and OSX with 27.2 and 28.5.
 Does your Emacs ever give memory back to the OS?
 How big is the delta between the tallied-up memory-report and real-world usage? (as reported by top in its USED metric (RSS + SWAP).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 In the past couple of years that I've been using emacs, I've never had a reason to give org-mode a try, but now I do. I Installed linux and wordpress on a raspberry-pi-4(which I'm going to use as a local web server to host the blog), and was able to get wordpress up and running nicely with some themes and plugins.
 When searching: does emacs work with wordpress, I saw this org2blog emacs package: https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog .
 Anyways, my goal is to use this local pi linux web server to host a simple wordpress blogging website. At 1st I just want to have a single web page, where I post a professional photo of myself with a hyperlink to my github projects. Eventually, I would like to do full blown blog posts with all kinds of stuff, like for example, if I'm applying for a particular freelance project, lets say python web scraping, I would want to create a simple python web-scraping application, push the completed project to github, then write a blog post, where I show step by step with coding blocks, how I developed and built the application from scratch. That way I can demonstrate to the client that I have the necessary skills required to complete that particular freelance gig.
 If there's any extra wordpress themes/plugins that you'd recommend for this use-case, then let me know.
 Also, I'm new to wordpress, so I'm not sure how remote wordpress development works, I would like to develop the blog using emacs on my laptop, test it to make sure that it works correctly and does not crash wordpress, then push the changes remotely to wordpress on the pi linux web server.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Emacs + LSP to program in C# and Unity and after using auto-completion several times my memory usage goes above 2GB RAM. Even with garbage-collect the RAM usage only goes to about 2GB and never less. Also, this is not a problem of omnisharp as it's memory usage won't go above the 100MB RAM.
 How can I fix this?
 This is the memory report before and after using LSP and completions:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I know the Base type family is used to be able to work with normal recursive types like the standard list type instead of data ListF a b = Cons a b | Nil.
 I guess there are alternative approaches, but I lack the appropriate terms to reasearch further. Every tip is appreciated.
 The question arose, because I translate Kmett's recursion schemes to my own typed language that unfortunately doesn't support type families.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am following Get Programming in Haskell by Will Kurt and in Unit1 Ch.5 closures are introduced.
 Specifically Listing 5.5 shows
 ```
 genHostRequestBuilder host =
 (\apiKey resource id -> getRequestURL host apiKey resource id) 
 exampleUrlBuilder = genHostRequestBuilder "http://amazon.com"
 genApiRequestBuilder hostBuilder apiKey =
 (\resource id -> hostBuilder apiKey resource id)
 myExampleUrlBuilder = genApiRequestBuilder exampleUrlBuilder "api-key"
 ```
 where closures are being used to make a function that at first accepts host, api key, resource, id as parameters but in the end just the resource and id since the host and api key are often redundant when making api calls to the same site.
 My attempt at the above was different but I'm able to get the correct answer, ie. a valid url to make an api request
 ```
 exampleUrlBuilder2 = exampleUrlBuilder "my-api-key"
 ```
 Thus it seems like this closure is overly complicated and in the process I discovered that I can create an alias for a function partially applied to one parameter? What is the advantage of the textbook's way of using a closure here instead of what I did?

 I'd like to define takeFoo :: Int -> [a] -> (Int, [a]), which tells immediately how many elements were successfully taken. What is the best name for such function?
 (If you are wondering about my context, this is actually not about lists, but about Text, where length is very expensive).

 The title says almost everything. I came across this amazing tool based on remark.js called xaringan, but every single tutorial that I read is based on using Rstudio as the suite to create and visualize the slides.
 I would like to use this library on Emacs, but honestly I am not familiar with R and this is the closest post that I found where they dedicate a single paragraph to say that you can use xaringan on Emacs by using the packages Emacs Speaks Statistics ess combined with surf browser.
 Thanks!

 Just wanted to share my final year university project repo which was implementing a language very similar to Elm:
 https://github.com/georgegarrington/Syphon
 Megaparsec used for parser, Hindley-Milner system (albeit I never implemented let polymorphism) based on this Cornell course used for the type system and custom transpiler made without using a string template library, didn't know this was a thing until after the deadline haha oops. Transpiles to ES6 making use of arrow functions for currying and uses React and Electron, useReducer hook in React is essentially the Elm architecture so this was used, and useEffect hook was used to implement subscriptions.
 Would love to know anyone's feedback at an amateur attempt at language implementation, and also hope this might help people working on a similar project :)

 which I assume are only the type id's from doing :t. Good. And I think I understand that since s -> (s, a) , i.e., (s, a) is a tuple, we are not violating the one-parameter restriction of a newtype. But what does s -> (s, a) mean, i.e., what is a function doing in a type declaration? I'm afraid I've never run across this before. Also, what could this type be used for?

Have you been stuck about when to use setq versus defvar? 
 Does it hurt when you see one allows documentation but not the other?
 
 Do your non-Lisp friends think setq is a strange name to define variables?
 Do your fingers cramp knowing there's no unified definition interface for variables & functions?
 Do you want to have an elegant, lightweight, syntax for furnishing functions and variables with runtime type checks? ---Including complex checks between function arguments!
  
Dr. Musa's “L”anguage “F”eatures lf-define macro cures all ills!

 Currently, I do (something similar to) the following
  (general-create-definer jl/major-modes :keymaps '(normal visual operator motion) :prefix "SPC" ) (jl/major-modes :keymaps 'org-mode-map "b" '(:ignore t :which-key: "Babel")) 
 If I have another key under "SPC b _" in another mode, which-key still displays "Babel" as "SPC b", rather than the usual "prefix".
 I have tried looking through the documentation for both general.el and which-key, but I can't find the correct way to set a prefix string.

In a perfect world, there would just be a library that allows for a deep embedding of Haskell inside Haskell. Does something like this exist?
 Maybe I could use parts of ghcide or hls, since they obviously need some way of working with source code, though I don't know if that's possible. (and in case it is, if it's a good idea)
 Maybe something like this could be done in template Haskell, but I don't know a lot about TH.
 A library that compiles haskell down to System FC would also be fine, though not perfect since I later need to generate haskell.
 Has anybody had a similar task?
 How did you solve it?
 Thanks in advance!

 I am in the process of tuning my configuration so as to recognise different machines and act upon it - for instance by executing particular functions or loading particular files. For this, I rely upon information outside of emacs such as environment variables and/or the desktop resolution.
 In one function, I was able to successfully use (getenv "HOME"). However, in another function, (getenv "HOST") evaluates to nil even though echo $HOST does show a legitimate value (though it does not show in printenv funnily enough...). Also, environment variables that I have set in my .zshrc and which show up in printenv cannot be called upon.
 Any tips / tricks are very welcome!
 Have a good day :)

You can define individual services, and then bring up an overview buffer from which you can start, stop, and view the status of each service. You can also bring up an output buffer for each running service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following this post of mine. From everyone answer (thanks guys!), I also thought that Scala code may be slow because of JVM slow warmup and startup time. So, I decide to quick implement the java code with almost exactly the same to Scala code to the same merged two sorted list problem. And here is the computing time and memory used.
 Scala, Rust, Python and Java computing time and space
 But what I found is that even Java doesn't have the same JVM problem! Java is even on par with Rust! (It may not exactly equal though, because the time unit is too large)
 So, what is the cause of slowness in Scala then?

 I want to learn emacs. I am a long time vim user, not planning on learning emacs for just text manipulation.
 I have done some basic elisp coding. But by brain never thinks like lisp.
 Found this amazing video that blew my mind. I am looking for more advanced level emacs/elisp videos, to get over my initial inhibition and think more lisp like. Please share.

The issue is that notmuch doesn't seem to distinguish the two. As the ones I'm currently using are my private ones, it doesn't matter a ton but I'd like to bring in my (much! more spammy) gmail and school mail, and would therefore like to know if there is an easy way to separate them.

 I've added 
 (setq org-ellipsis " ▾") 
 to my .emacs
 After loading that, when I open an .org file, the character shows up as " â¾" ; same for with describe-variable -> org-ellipsis. I visit my .emacs, M-x eval-buffer and then reopen the org file and it's fixed. 
 Any ideas? Is there something weird with encoding?
 I wondered if the font used in my headings didn't support that character, but "C-x 8 RET 25be" types it no problem in either default font used in my .org files.
 seems a similar issue occurred with this person as well: although I have not messed with its face settings on purpose https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/48272/org-mode-ellipsis-arrow-is-not-using-my-defined-encoding-utf-8

 runtime and memory usage of various programming language
 At first, I have implemented the recursive (652 ms) and changed to imperative one to squeeze its performance (464 ms). But its performance still lower than python anyway. Below is the code that I wrote in Scala in imperative style. (Python code is written almost exactly the same)
 // class ListNode(_x: Int = 0, _next: ListNode = null) { // var next: ListNode = _next // var x: Int = _x // } def mergeTwoLists(l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode): ListNode = { var ll1 = l1 var ll2 = l2 var result = ListNode(0) var cur_res = result while (ll1 != null || ll2 != null) { if (ll1 == null) { cur_res.next = ll2 ll2 = null } else if (ll2 == null) { cur_res.next = ll1 ll1 = null } else if (ll1.x > ll2.x) { cur_res.next = ListNode(ll2.x) ll2 = ll2.next } else { cur_res.next = ListNode(ll1.x) ll1 = ll1.next } cur_res = cur_res.next } return result.next } 
 What is the cause of this? Or Scala is actually slower than Python?

 ​
 Apologies for the question. I have tried searching about this problem, but posts I found do not seem to be the exact same issue.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/lurdquh8r3b71.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3c5f764e216a873f2473dee877aafb9dec36bbb
 The screenshot above shows that I am unable to use any of my linters from python even though they have been installed in my environment, which I use conda.el to manage.
 When I run M-: (executable-find "flake8"), it actually does show the flake8 executable from the correct anaconda environment. I am thus unsure why flycheck is unable to find any of the executables from my linters. 
 ​
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

Prompt user for a font family (e.g. from font-family-list)
 Open temp buffer into which I generate strings, in the font, in various sizes
  
I can do this easily enough for ASCII characters by doing
 (insert (propertize "Lorem ipsum" 'face `(:family ,font))) 
 And this does work for non-ASCII characters under emacs -Q.
 However for my personal config I have customized the default fontset to use various fonts according to charset or script:
 (set-fontset-font t 'han "MyCjkFont") 
 In the presence of this customization I find that no matter what I do, MyCjkFont is always used for characters in han. I've tried making custom fontsets, playing with faces, etc., but nothing has worked.
 The type specimen should be ephemeral and self-contained, so I don't want to modify the default fontset when generating it (doing so would affect all other windows/buffers, and the changes would persist after killing the specimen).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of my Tweag fellowship, I developed dingo,
a Python package to analyze metabolic networks. dingo provides three methods
that complement the openCOBRA project. The main
advantage of dingo is the efficient implementation
of new sampling algorithms that generate steady states of metabolic networks.
In this post, I’ll explain what this all means and even discuss how
we can use this tool to discover new COVID-19 treatments.
Also check out the audio interview with Apostolos about dingo on the Compositional podcast!
Metabolic networks and COVID-19
Every moment, in every cell of our body, thousands of chemical reactions are

I'm curious. In my role I find my reading notes often come in handy because I am asked to articulate a position or make some recommendation on something, but I think it would feel strange to start to have a mass of notes on the internal workings of my employer. I wonder if this is something people do, or if they keep it more for personal projects (or for those spaces where the personal and professional overlap).]]></summary>

 TL;DR: How to get M-. and M-, to work in geiser / guile the way they work for emacs lisp?
 I hope I chose the right community to ask this. Feel free to tell me if I didn't, and suggest where to ask otherwise. I am an aspiring lisp / scheme hacker. One thing that I would really get into is gnu guix, the distro which is powered by the guile programming language. 
 So far, all my attempts to combine emacs and geiser whilst hacking guix have gone suboptimally. The main thing that doesn't work for me is the ability to jump to a symbol's definition using M-. or M-,. This is what I have used browsing emacs lisp code, and I feel this is instrumental to learning the language and how stuff works when you kinda know the basics, but not more than that.
 Thus, I would love to know how I would have to set guile and geiser up so that I will be able to use that most useful function.
 Maybe I am missing something super obvious here that I have not mentioned. Please, if this is the case, feel free to point me to it!
 Have a good day, fellows!

gist
  
I recently made a post about deriving GADTs with DerivingVia and it got me thinking if I could implement generic definitions without so much boilerplate. The standard way of defining such a generic instance with GHC.Generics is to define a type class
 class GBinaryPut f where gput :: f t -> Put 
 with an instance for each of the polynomial functor building blocks
 instance GBinaryPut V1 where gput _ = pure () instance GBinaryPut U1 where gput U1 = pure () instance (GBinaryPut a, GBinaryPut b) => GBinaryPut (a :*: b) where gput (x :*: y) = gput x <> gput y instance GBinaryPut a => GBinaryPut (M1 i c a) where gput = gput . unM1 instance Binary a => GBinaryPut (K1 i a) where gput = put . unK1

 So I sat down with him and wrote a program that is essentially the cat tool without all the bloat like --help and stuff: take filename in, read the file, print it out. And that program literally takes two lines of Haskell code. It came out so concise without me even trying that I just had to share it with you.
 import System.Environment (getArgs) main = getArgs >>= (readFile . head) >>= putStrLn 
 It's actually just one line of useful code if you exclude the import statement. Show me a language that can do it more elegantly! I'll wait...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heya all.
 I have a long history as a software developer, both in commercial environments and in academic research labs (mostly C, Scheme/LISP, Python, some Java). Back in 2013 I got into Spark and Scala working for a startup and kind of burned out by 2015. I decided to try new things and bought a farm and spent the last 5-6 years growing food, working outside etc. However, I find myself wanting to go back and at least pick up contracts/gigs to make some additional income, invest more into my retirement etc.
 It has been 6 years since I looked at Scala and I know things have changed since.
 A few questions: 1) what is the easiest/best way to get back in the game and refresh/catch up on everything that happened in the language? and 2) will anyone even consider me after a multi-year unrelated gap in my resume? When I "retired", I was at the senior level but obviously do not expect to get back at that level (no ego here). What is the best way to approach this - where do I look, how do I approach potential employers?
 Thanks!

 The good thing about org ids is that they allow linking to headlines even if you move things around (when you split off a headline into a new file, say). The bad thing is the ids are UUIDs meaning they contain no information whatsoever on what they’re actually for. This is annoying when you’re editing a link (IMHO).
 So I made something that creates human readable links. This turns out to be a bit involved, as generating UUIDs is stuck somewhere deep inside another function you really don’t want to mess with (separation of concerns apparently is not a thing in org-id code?).
 What it does is when you store a link ( C-c l) it checks whether there already is an ID property. If there isn’t, it creates a new on…]]></summary>

 newtype Foo = Foo { unFoo :: Char } myFunc = Foo . doSomething . unFoo 
 I had another newtype. Pretty soon I had single lines with multiple wrappings and unwrappings. E.g.:
 newtype Bar = Bar { unBar :: String } somePolymorphicFunc :: Int -> a -> [a] -> [a] modify (Bar . somePolymorphicFunc x (unFoo y) . unBar) 
 I didn't like this line. Then it hit me: dealing with newtypes was supposed to be a solved problem. Instead I could write:

 modify (coerce somePolymorphicFunc x y)

 Wrong. While GHC could tell I wanted to turn somePolymorphicFunc into an Int -> Bar -> Foo -> Foo, it didn't know what type to coerce it from. I'd have to write.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I continue to dig into continuations I wondered if I could add shift and reset to LogicT. The immediate problem I ran into is that LogicT uses a forall r. internally and so even though you can write shift and reset, you can't actually use the lambda you get from calling shift.
 So the first thing I did was to change LogicT to expose r:
 newtype LogicT r m a = LogicT { unLogicT :: (a -> m r -> m r) -> m r -> m r} 
 Then I quickly copied over a bunch of the definitions in Control.Monad.Logic no problem. I had to generalize the types of course to add r but it was trivial to do. There's a few things I haven't converted yet like msplit, but I don't expect to run into any issues.
 I ended up with these shift/reset operators:

Spacemacs seems to have shifted to it by default. BUT there's one big flaw IMHO: With neotree, the file tree for the project that I was currently in appeared; with treemacs, a whole set of projects appear other than the one that I am working in. This adds extra noise and in some cases is just inconvenient because I have to worry about adding/removing projects.
 Is there any way to get treemacs to behave a bit more like neotree?

 (1.) A (with-visible-region ...) macro, which "maps" its body over visible portions of the current region.
 Or (2.) A "Narrow to visible portion(s) of region" - I have no idea if narrowed buffers can show multiple subsets of a buffer, but I'm pretty sure I've seen some occur-like modes do this and keep the selections editable.
 I'd prefer the first solution, and it's probably easy to implement, but thought I'd ask about prior art first :) always good to learn new tricks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a newbie in Machine Learning Engineer field from Thailand and only have to deal with python and its machine learning package in my profession like pyspark and sk-learn. I would like to expand my skill set by doing side project on the AIoT fields (raspberry pi, backend and frontend) with another programming language which have higher performance.
 At first, I think Rust is the interesting choice as raspberry pi has limited resources and very fun to code.
 But, I am more interested in the new announced Scala 3 since it is the language being used in many of the data science fields. It has Scala.js which can be implemented on frontend. And it is very fun to code in functional style.
 However, in Thailand, the Scala jobs is nearly non-existent.
  
But what about Scala popularity in other countries?
 Any thought on the Scala 3 full stack?
 If Scala is not popular, I would like to hear the reason too.
 And what about Rust popularity in other countries?
  
Thanks in advance for your opinion everyone!

 This is what I came up with:
 (add-hook 'find-file-hook (lambda () (let* ((tagspath ".git/etags") (git-root (locate-dominating-file (buffer-file-name) tagspath))) (if git-root (visit-tags-table (expand-file-name tagspath git-root) 1)))))

 The index provides a simple UI for browsing by tag, and each book page has basic information and links. By subscribing to the following RSS feed, you get a notification when a new book is added to the index.

 I'm pretty new to Haskell itself and its development ecosystem. I'm trying to setup a Haskell Language Server for Neovim 0.5 (with native LSP support). Previously I was using CoC and HLS that I installed via ghcup and it worked just fine. Now with new version of Neovim I stopped using CoC and trying to make HLS work with native LSP. I have no idea on how to make my already installed HLS work together with native LSP, so I tried to install HLS via lspinstall plugin, but I always get the same error:
 ghcide compiled against GHC 8.10.5 but currently using 8.10.4 This is unsupported, ghcide must be compiled with the same GHC version as the project.
 I checked a version of `ghc` (with ghc -v) on my machine the output is:
 The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.5
 I also tried to create a new project with stack new ... to check if that issue persists there and it does.
 Does anybody have similar issues?
 If anybody could share his way of configuring Neovim LSP + HLS that would be great!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone. I'm using Emacs everywhere - on my linux laptop and work mac laptop, and whenever I get a chance I'll use my large monitor for better screen real estate. I'm determined to use one init.el file, rather than maintaining several.
 I find I need to adjust the default font anytime I switch machines or screen sizes. On the Mac, I want Emacs to use Menlo, but on Linux I want FiraCode. When I'm not plugged into the monitor, I want size 11, but I need it the font at size 14 on large resolutions (i.e., greater than 1600).
 I'm just starting to learn elisp, so I get into trouble pretty quickly. I was hoping to craft something like the following, but also taking into account (string-equal system-type "darwin"). and swapping FiraCode for Menlo in that situation.
 ;; set the font size based on resolution (if (> (x-display-pixel-width) 1600) (add-to-list 'initial-frame-alist '(font . "Fira Code-11")) (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "Fira Code-14"))) 
 Then, it occurred to me that I'm not unique in my situation, and I should just ask if anyone else has Elisp that handles this situation. Will you Emacs wizards share Elisp where you handle this sort of thing?
 In the meantime, I'm off to find a good Elisp tutorial so I won't need to ask for this kind of help in the future. Much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Played around with a nice TH tutorial posted here not a long ago.
 I've just copy-pasted relevant code snippets from the article - definitions for relevant generateTupleBoilerplate, generateTupleClass and generateTupleInstance - here is the source. Then in the main module used it for generating 62(current limit) type classes for tuples and their instances - source.
 My question: is that normal for such simple program GHC consumes really huge memory ~1.2 GiB at compilation, while full web-application project based on Servant takes about 400 MiB at max? Talking about RSS memory footprint, tested with GHC 9.0.1 . Either loading in ghci REPL or compiling with ghc -O makes no difference.
 Is this a known issue with TH extension or template-haskell package & its dependencies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I want to build a Set with do-notation, ala []
 bars :: Set Bar basz :: Set Baz foos :: Set Foo foos = do bar <- bars baz <- bazs pure $ mkFoo bar baz 
 Set is not a monad, which I get, so this doesn't work. But QualifiedDo let's you use do-notation to build non-Monads. So let's say I make a module that looks like this
 module SetDo where import Data.Set (Set) import qualified Data.Set as Set fmap :: Ord b => (a -> b) -> Set a -> Set b fmap = Set.map return = Set.singleton ma >>= mf = Set.unions $ Set.map mf ma 
 And this makes everything work! Very cool, QualifiedDo doing QualifiedDo things. However, it's clear that foo doesn't require the full power of a monad. ApplicativeDo, here we come. Turn it on, implement some bindings
 pure = Set.singleton ma <*> mb = ma >>= \f -> Set.map f mb 
 and....bummer
 • Could not deduce (Ord (Baz -> Foo)) arising from a do statement (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?) 
 which unfortunately makes total sense. ApplicativeDo desugars into
 foos = (\bar baz -> mkFoo bar baz) <$> bars <*> bazs 
 which is trying to use fmap to make an intermediate Set (Baz -> Foo). However, I cannot see a theoretical reason this could not desugar into this instead
 foos = liftA2 mkFoo bars bazs 
 given a binding
 liftA2 :: Ord c=> (a -> b -> c) -> Set a -> Set b -> Set c liftA2 f as bs = Set.map (uncurry f) (Set.cartesianProduct as bs) 
 So it seems like what I want to do is not unsound, but is not possible given how ApplicativeDo works. Am I wrong? If I am, what can I do? If not, has this limitation of ApplicativeDo been discussed anywhere else? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reading Christian Tietze's and Sascha Fast's blog posts on the importance of tracking inspired me to track how many Zettels I create.
I figured that keeping a list of Zettels created daily would be useless without a workflow to integrate it in. So, I watched Brian Crain's presentation on optimizing productivity, which was cited in one of the blog posts from the Zettelkasten blog. Also, I read this article from the Quantified Self website that I found along the way.
I decided that I want to do something similar to Brian Crain. From tracking how many pomodori he completed, he gained the ability to achieve two things: notice a standard for his good days/weeks/months/quarters/years, and compare how well he did with how well he is doing. I want to achieve the same from tracking how many Zettels I create.
From looking at his setup, I'd have to track the following:
Total from a year
Total from the first to the fourth quarters
Monthly average
Weekly average
Number of weeks in which I get my weekly average or above it
Daily average
Number of days in which I get my daily average or above it
He tracked more, but this is all I could understand from his presentation and slides.
My problem is setting up an user interface to manage all of this in a way that is simple and allows me to get every item easily. Brian Crain didn't talk much about his setup. Also, I have zero knowledge in using spreadsheets. So the question is: How do I achieve what I want to accomplish?
Really appreciate any help you can give me.]]></summary>

 EDIT:
 I found the function responsible for it and it seems intentional:
 (defun org-attach-id-uuid-folder-format (id) "Translate an UUID ID into a folder-path. Default format for how Org translates ID properties to a path for attachments. Useful if ID is generated with UUID." (format "%s/%s" (substring id 0 2) (substring id 2))) 
 But I'm still not sure why it is designed this way. Is there a special meaning to the first 2 characters of a UUID?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am switching to Programmer's Dvorak and don't yet have an ortholinear keyboard. The biggest pain point so far is that C-x is really annoying to reach, since it's what was C-b on QWERTY. This means that many of my most frequent commands, such as C-x C-s, are a real stretch (QWERTY C-b C-;). How have any of the esteemed Dvorak emacsers reading this made peace with these C-x problems?

If not, would another package (rtags, ede-compdb, irony-cdb) help query the compilation database without needing to use the rest of the package? The main use case is to plug it into other tools such as rmsbolt and templight that "compile" code to provide additional information.
 ccls-specific: Can the ccls cache for the current project be queried to obtain a list of all the files currently cached/indexed? If so, can it provide the compilation command associated with each of those files? This would help tremendously with header files in C++ or C.

 I'm reading TaPL and want to implement a parser for the untyped lambda calculus in Part I.
 I want to parse the source code with its context which records the names of variables. In Parsec, the parser library in Haskell, there is a parameter u standing for the user-defined state type. On the other hand, there is no such parameter in Parser in purescript-parsing.
 Should I rewrite a parser library with states, or is there a good method to join states with parsers?

 After reading a lot of posts here and on other place in www I started using Caps and Return long-press as Ctrl. It's really nice to have two Ctrl on my Mac without disrupting Caps and Return key. I am using Karabiner BTW to do it.
 This creates a new problem for me where if I press Ctrl with my pinky then it is really awkward to press save and close shortcuts (C-x C-s or C-x C-c). When Ctrl was in corner it was natural to use index and middle finger for those shortcuts but with Caps as Ctrl it feels a bit of stretch to use middle finger for s and index finger for x. That loweing the finger is also not very comfortable.
 Where am I going wrong with my finger placement?

 I ask this because I often have to look at logs for work, and though 'CSV-Mode' has helped for some logs, its not that great on an actual client's backend system (CentOS).
 Would love to hear some thoughts on this because so far I've been using 'Line-Mode' in ansi-term to just copy and paste, make tables on the fly with 'C-c |' but thought maybe this could be done a bit easier and more direct INSIDE my org mode doc notes.

 does anyone have a workaround/fix for the following issue:
 When exporting a document via the latex-backend footnotes inside of verse-blocks are not resolved correctly:
 #+begin_verse lorem ipsum dolor sit amet[fn::This is a footnote] #+end_verse 
 results in the .tex file as
 \begin{verse} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\footnotemark \end{verse} \footnotetext[<number>]{This is a footnote} 
 This has the irritating result that in the pdf the footnote is numbered with whatever <number> is given by the automatic export.
 The expected result would be (at least I think so)
 \begin{verse} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\footnotemark \end{verse} \footnotetext{This is a footnote} 
 At the moment I'm stuck with deleting every [<number>] argument – which works, but is obviously tedious.
 About the document: It is written in a report/book class, so numbering starts anew, when a new chapter is begun. otherwise it probably would stay unnoticed.
 ​
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy all!
 I wrote a WAV editor (GUI application) in Haskell which targets long-form narration audio. I'm releasing a public beta for it and thought I'd share here.
 It weighs in at ~9kloc and uses the SDL2 gaming lib for graphics and audio playback. The architecture uses a hybrid of OOP and functional techniques: the Model-View-Presenter pattern with FRP (via netwire) driving the UI interactivity.
 The codebase isn't super polished and I've yet to write tests, so there's bound to be cruft, but any feedback would be appreciated -- do let me know if I did anything exceedingly stupid (besides not writing tests yet, that is)!
 Resources:
  
osabe.app (consumer site)
 dev blog
 code repo
 @osabe_app on Twitter for release announcements, etc.
 @paul_schnapp on Twitter for dev discussion
  
There are a few things I could use some help with if anyone has the time and expertise:
  
There appears to be a slow memory leak with unevaluated thunks that I can't nail down (I think somewhere in the Presenter, though possibly the Model)
 I'm having trouble nicely packaging the app with all the libs it needs on Mac

 I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to use org mode to represent repeating calendar events. In typical calendars, repeating events can be specified with rrules. However, while I see that org mode has repeaters, I haven't figured out how to do several things that I can do with rrules.
 Examples:
 (1) repeat on the last day of every month
 (2) repeat on every 1st and 15th day of every month
 (3) repeat every Mon, Wed, Fri
 ​
 Is it possible to encode these repeat patterns in org mode? If so, how?
 If not, is there some extension package which enriches org mode with more sophisticated datetime patterns?
 Thanks in advance for any info you can offer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to make a switch back to linux after quite a long time away (from before switching to emacs).
 Most stuff just worked but I have a few issues. Specifically right now the thing that is bugging me is different behavior for end-of-buffer. 
 On Mac OS I can jump to the end (or beginning) of a buffer with no issue. On linux the command works and appears to be the same (looked up via C-h k) but in addition to the jump it defines a region in the process. 
 It's giving me the behavior that's I'd get on my old machine if I set the mark then jumped. 
 If there's a setting somewhere I'm not seeing it... any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on the effectful library and I've encountered that function of such shape is helpful for lifting monadic actions where m r shows in invariant position (e.g. like the unmask callback within mask).
 Hoogle search returns no results.
 The exact signature looks like this:
 withLiftH :: IOE :> es => ((forall a b localEs. (IO a -> IO b) -> Eff localEs a -> Eff localEs b) -> Eff es r) -> Eff es r 
 withLiftH is a working name, but perhaps there is a better name for this function?
 EDIT: Never mind, I realized this function is too permissive and will subtly break when misused with multiple threads (e.g. because you can happily use it to lift forkIO) considering the internal representation of Eff. My previous idea was a bit more complicated, but it'll work reliably.
 I thought I could make the API a bit nicer, but this just won't do.

 I see emacs successfully installing font files under home and running fc-cache:
 $ ls -al ~/Library/Fonts/ ... -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 44732 Jul 8 21:06 all-the-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 489672 Jul 8 21:06 file-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 152796 Jul 8 21:06 fontawesome.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 128180 Jul 8 21:06 material-design-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 52544 Jul 8 21:06 octicons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 99564 Jul 8 21:06 weathericons.ttf 
 However, at runtime, those fonts are not picked up and garbled international characters are shown instead of the icons.
 The solution I found was to forcefully copy all these ttf files into /Library/Fonts(i.e., the system-wide font directory).
 Once in the system wide Fonts directory, emacs successfully picks up fonts with no troubles.
 Please advise if you know a cleaner solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm hoping this is a simple started project b/c my ELisp is a bit basic. If I'm biting off more than I can chew, please let me know. I've written a linear algebra library in Elisp so from a straight coding point of view I'm okay, but I'm not very verse in how to interact with the Emacs ecosystem.
 What I'd like to do is to write simplified version of the ob-clojure. One that doesn't depend on running CIDER. The current integration with CIDER seems to be a legacy requirement from when Clojure didn't come with a REPL.
 I'm currently use Octave in a literate mode and it's pretty great. I can make plots in-line to my notes and then export it all to HTML. ex: https://geokon-gh.github.io/rocks/orbital.html . With Clojure the equivalent is a bit problematic b/c the core language is very bare so you need to use libraries and this is all managed typically through a deps.edn central config file (or in ob-clojure's case, lein). So that suddenly is not very REPL-y and orthogonal to the literal workflow.
 Fortunately this seems to be something you can get around now a days withadd-lib https://insideclojure.org/2018/05/04/add-lib/
 The idea would be to launch an inferior clj process with something like
 clj -Sdeps "{:deps {org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha {:mvn/version \"0.11.935\"}}}" 
 Then you can in a literate way, add libraries on the fly and do the normal literate workflow like in Octave.
 I found a template for how to write a new language support https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el
 It seems relatively straightforward - but I'm unclear on how to launch a clj inferior mode and pipe things in/out of it. Is there some canonical way to do that? (I'm okay if this only works on Linux)
 Any just general tips and suggestions would be welcome :) and if this is all a bit more complicated than I make it out to be, please let me know. I don't want to have to sink a month into this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My personal keybindings, installed at Emacs start-up as a global minor mode, are numerous and a disorganized mess. That Time Has Come to refactor while preserving the muscle memory of my existing bindings. 
 I'm aware of bind-key.el and general.el. Bind-key is sweet, especially for the tight integration with use-package, but I think I need something with a bit more beef, like general.el, not least for its concept of layers, something I crudely reinvented in my own system. 
 I'm also considering -- seriously! -- the native menu system in Emacs. I don't know why it's so disliked. It's essentially a visual leader-key framework built rather elegantly from keymaps. No need for which-key.el or transient.el for prompting and discoverability. You can even use it with a mouse of course. I figure that I can't go wrong sticking with a framework already built into Emacs.
 An essential requirement for me: I code in Org Babel. I already structure my keybinding code with Org outlines and tagging to make it all easily navigable. This approach I need to keep. 
 Am I overlooking any packages? I'm facing a year of work. Naturally I must start off right. BTW, I've never used Vim and I am not interested in going down the pure Evil route as in Spacemacs, super-impressive though it is. Kudos to the Spacemacs folks, who have won so many converts to Emacs just as Magit and Org have. 
 I put my fate into the hands of r/emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a recursive function that conceptually ought to work even though there's no explicit base case. Specifically, successive elements of a finite data structure depend on (what should be) prior elements. 
 It type-checks and compiles, but when I try to run it in GHCI, it hangs for ~10s, throws a *** Exception: stack overflow, and then several seconds later GHCI is killed.
 There are a lot of things that could be undermining my assumptions.
 I understand that debugging these kinds of things is difficult in Haskell (for exactly the reasons good recursion is easy to do); I'm only on my first day with this problem. Are there normal strategies or tools for homing in on the cause?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have this simple type of Boolean expressions:
 ``` data BoolExp a = BSelect a | BNot (BoolExp a) | BAnd [BoolExp a] | BOr [(BoolExp a)]
 instance Show a => Show (BoolExp a) where show (BSelect a) = show a show (BNot a) = "! " ++ pwrap (show a) show (BAnd as) = intercalate " & " ( (pwrap . show) <$> as) show (BOr as) = intercalate " | " ( (pwrap . show) <$> as)
 pwrap p = "(" ++ p ++ ")" ```
 My goal is to be able to parse them. I have written this code:
 ``` import Text.Parsec import Text.Parsec.String import qualified Text.Parsec.Token as P import Text.Parsec.Language (emptyDef) import qualified Data.ByteString as B
 import Regex.Types
 lexer = P.makeTokenParser emptyDef
 parens = P.parens lexer braces = P.braces lexer symbol = P.symbol lexer natural = P.natural lexer
 pSelect :: Integral a => Parser (BoolExp a) pSelect = BSelect <$> fromIntegral <$> natural
 pAnd :: Parser (BoolExp a) -> Parser (BoolExp a) pAnd prsr = BAnd <$> prsr sepBy1 (symbol "&")
 pOr :: Parser (BoolExp a) -> Parser (BoolExp a) pOr prsr = BOr <$> prsr sepBy1 (symbol "|")
 pNot :: Parser (BoolExp a) -> Parser (BoolExp a) pNot prsr = BNot <$> ((symbol "!") *> prsr)
 pBool :: Integral a => Parser (BoolExp a) pBool = try (pNot pBool) <|> try (pOr pBool) <|> try (pAnd pBool) <|> try (parens pBool) <|> pSelect ```
 I think the grammar I am trying to go for is self explanatory based on the code. However, this goes into a loop for most expressions, even parse pBool "" "! 12". How can I fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use gnus, and I've been learning about org-capture. I like what I've seen several people do, which is to create a capture template for responding to emails. Since this will only ever be invoked from a buffer where you are viewing an email, the template can include clever things, like a link to the email you want to reply to. There is a good example here.
 It seems to me the obvious thing to do is to make this whole process as seamless as possible, and just make the TODO entry a link to a response---the template should include an org link which, when activated, opens a reply message to the original message, just as if I had pressed r in gnus.
 The 'just as if...' is the tricky bit. I make extensive use of posting styles, and keep all of my email config in gnus.el, which is only initialised when gnus is loaded. I want all this to apply properly when I follow the link, even if I don't happen to have opened gnus directly yet in that session (obviously, the link will still have to trigger loading gnus.el). I think this rules out a simply mailto link.
 Even if it didn't, I'm not sure if mailto links can do responses. Standard responses, as written in gnus and pretty much everything else, are generated from the original email (to the original sender, subject should be Re: original subject and so on).
 I know that org links can include arbitrary elisp. Perhaps the answer is a function (a preexisting one, or a wrapper around such), and clever use of some of the org capture expandos?
 How might I do this? Any ideas would be great. TIA!

I like this arrangement because I can have only related files open in each Emacs or have different searches or find buffers in different Emacs apps. This of course can’t use emacsclient so you don’t get any boost starting Emacs but I don’t care since I leave them running for days or weeks. If anybody wants this script I can share it. I got the different icons from the Homebrew Emacs Plus project. If everyone thinks this is a stupid idea forget I said anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day everyone!
 I've always been using scalamock with scalatest only, but now I'd like to optimize my tests by rewriting long running sequential scalatest suites to uTest. I'm using default scalatest MockFactory for my suite. I know that it's supposed to work with scalatest only and I've seen in scalamock guide that you can implement your own MockFactoryBase and it should somehow work, but I didn't really work for me(maybe I just understood guid wrong). 
 I create separate instance of the mock in every test context
 test("blah blah") {val myMock = mock[TraitToMock] ...}
 Also my project is written using cats-effect, so I'm running tests also with it's IO 
 And in process I faced multiple issues such as:
 java.util.ConcurrentModificationException: mutation occurred during iteration
 It seems it's because in UnorderedHandler(which is used in my tests) handle method they're using synchronization, but in parent Handler class operations with handlers are not synchronized.

 Wrapping this methods in synchronization helps and tests don't fail. But it seems like this fix is not the best solution.
 If I'm not getting exception listed above, I get like intersection of mock contexts, mocks handle each other expectations. Something like that

 So maybe someone knows how to make scalamock work with utest properly? Maybe I missed something important or overcomplicate things and much easier solution exists? 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone, 
 I've been using emacs for 2 months now, like it a lot. I'm still trying to figure out the best way of navigating around, and this question is very vague. 
 I mainly do embedded linux work. And it kind of seems to me like there are two approaches to navigating to files as you work on a project. 
 The first approach is that you open a terminal, and move around with cd. When you find a file you want to edit you open up emacs for that particular file, then close emacs when you are done editing. 
 The the second approach is that you just open emacs, and navigate using dired or going to recently opened buffers, never closing emacs. I might also have a terminal open to try running the code.
 It seems to me that emacs lends itself more to the second approach, and perhaps vim is more suited for the first? No idea if that is true, but I've kind of settled into the second approach. I also have just been using the emacs GUI which I also imagine also lends itself to the second approach. 
 I'm curious how other people have their workflow setup. Anyone else run emacs in a GUI along side a terminal, or is that just weird? 
 Thanks, 
 -Hunter

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am not a full-time developer/coder. But I have been coding for the last ~17 years.
 I have mainly used java. For almost a decade I did not even use a build tool other than ANT and used Netbeans. Then I shifted to maven.
 Now I want to shift to Scala 3. That requires changing the build tool also.
 I don't have a problem when it comes to Scala. Somehow I am not still comfortable with the build tool. I feel I would prefer either mill or Maven, over SBT. Mill because it is said to be faster than SBT and seems more powerful. Maven because it seems to provide the maximum support amongst all build tools in the JVM ecosystem. For example, the Gluonvm plugin works fine on maven, the Gradle plugin is still a mess, and I am not even sure about the status of this in SBT or mill.
 Q1) Do you think it is good to use maven to work with Scala while I captch up and become more familiar with the scala ecosystem. Is it even possible? Workable? Sane?
 My requirements are simple - simple maven projects, quarkus, javafx, gluovm (with graalvm build support). I have some legacy java code I wish to maintain, this is impoart for time being. So if I can universally use the same build tool for java also, it would be nice. 
 Note: Wire (a mobile messaging app) seems to be experimenting with scala and JavaFx, and their build tools seem to be maven: https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/HelloFXML3 
 tagging /u/makingthematrix 
 Q2) If not maven, then SBT or Mill, which one fits the above more. My personal bias is more towards Mill, but it has a much smaller ecosystem, so I wonder if it will provide anything close to out of box support for Gluonvm for example.
 ​
 Thanks a tonne

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find imenu very helpful for quickly jumping back and forth between defuns in buffers containing lots of function definitions. However, when this command is invoked in an org-mode buffer, the relevant units cease to be defuns and become org headings instead. This makes sense in most cases, but when the org buffer is visiting a literate configuration file, it would be nice if imenu behaved as it normally does in programming modes. Example:
 ``` * Section one
 +begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
 (defun function-one () "This is not a useful function.")
 +end_src
  
Section two
  
+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
 (defun function-two () "This is not a useful function, either.")
 +end_src
 ```
 When invoked here, I would like imenu to let me choose between function-one and function-two rather than between * Section one and * Section two.
 Is there a way to modify imenu so that it behaves as I'm describing? Alternatively, is there a similar command or package that provides this sort of functionality?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The design of a library like linear-base, Tweag’s standard library for Haskell’s
linear types, requires many choices.
One of these choices for linear-base is what a linear Traversable
type class should look like.
One way I use to approach such problems
is to implement instances for the types in GHC.Generics.
GHC.Generics provides a way to implement datatype-generic functions by translating a datatype to and from
a limited set of primitive datatypes representing sums, products, constants, etc.
Therefore, a type class implemented for this set can be given an
instance at a large class of algebraic datatypes.
So this is a nice way to apply structural reasoning to a problem.
The problem
Here is the signature of fmap in linear-base, as it applies, for instance, to lists:

Problem is, if I type C-x, which key shows some bindings in the mini buffer, which often does not fit there, and it shows 1/3 (page 1 of 3). But how do I get to page 2 or 3? If I click on the mini buffer or click on the scroll bar of mini buffer, or type anything else, the mini buffer disappears! What to do?
 Update: After further observation, I noticed two things:
  
I was wrongly using the next page command. I should have been using 'C-h n C-h n' to get to third page of which-key popup window instead of 'C-h n n'
 
However, if I use C-h, when the which-key popup window opens up now with available key binding information, it has now two pages, and I cannot use 'C-h n' to get to the 2nd page. As soon as I type C-h, emacs interprets it as me invoking C-h C-h and reacts accordingly. How do I solve this case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using use-package and I am trying to defer the loading of some packages from my init.el. If I understand correctly, this requires that I specify the commands that are to be autoloaded in a :commands block. For some modes, I have found that this is easy and it works. However, for some modes like geiser, I've tried specifying the obvious entry points (e.g. geiser, run-geiser, and geiser-repl) but portions of geiser are still loading and being shown in the features variable. Is there a way to determine what is causing these features to be loaded? I have tried with :defer set both to t and nil with no effect. Perhaps one complication is that geiser already defines some autoload functions (none of which should be called during initialization, I think) and I am not sure how those interact with :commands and :defer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the excitement around Scala 3, I'm curious to get a sense of what the norms are (or likely to be) for backend web development at your company (for those who use Scala at work). Or simply - what would you recommend?
 From what I've explored just messing around, Play, Scalatra, Jooby, Vert.x. Thinking of a FastAPI/Flask/Falcon equivalent ideally.
 How do you find Java interop generally? Is it as simple as using a Java library from Scala?
 In a similar vein, what's your preferred database interaction library? (I Love SLQAlchemy Core in Python, and Dapper in .NET).
 I'm also very very curious, coming from Python originally, how you think the migration from 2.x to 3.x will go. (Especially in terms of timeline). Python 2 to 3 was long and a bit painful, but from everything I've read it should be a faster and more comfortable transition for Scala.
 Lastly - it seems SBT is still the tool of choice? Are build times still tricky even with Scala 3? Is it worth hanging around for those to improve, or looking into Mill, or trying to get Gradle to play nice?
 My goal is to dive in and get familiar with the Scala world, but also, evaluate it for use at work.
 Warm thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I've been recently playing with org-web-tools and Elisp in general. I'm completely a Elisp noob and that's why I hope to get more information here. 
 ​
 I'm trying to to use org-capture to create a custom template (not for ORG mode). What I'd like to have is following:
 * [[%site-title|site-url]] 
 I've found this function which will create an ORG link using org-web-tools:
 ;; https://blog.lazkani.io/posts/text-editors/bookmark-with-org-capture/ (defun org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url () "Extend =org-web-tools-inster-link-for-url= to take URL from clipboard or kill-ring" (interactive) (org-web-tools--org-link-for-url (org-web-tools--get-first-url))) 
 That function I can use in my org-capture templates like this:
  ("b" "Bookmark (Clipboard)" entry (file+headline "~/work/sync/org/bookmarks.org" "Bookmarks") "** %(org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url)\n:PROPERTIES:\n:TIMESTAMP: %t\n:END:\n%?" :prepend t) 
 However how can I modify org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url to create a new string like I've mentioned above. The function should return 
 * [[%site-title|s%site-url]] 
 for a given URL in the clipboard. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past previous years, I have tried variety of ways to boost emacs start up time.
  
server + emacsclient
 use-package to defer package loading
 change GC threshold to large value in init.el
 manipulate pdump
 native-comp
  
So far I was able to load most packages without defer in 1s. I was pretty happy.
 Until today, I saw a startup summary function from https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/
 (message "*** Emacs loaded in %s with %d garbage collections." (format "%.2f seconds" (float-time (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time))) gcs-done) 
 Then it reports
 *** Emacs loaded in 0.84 seconds with 40 garbage collections. 
 The 40 GCs don't quite make sense since I have changed my GC threshold early on in init.el
 Then I tried the following in my early-init.el
 (setq gc-cons-threshold 8000000) ;; ~8MB 
 The number improves to
 *** Emacs loaded in 0.48 seconds with 5 garbage collections. 
 For an example, loading evil changes from
 Loading package evil...done (0.125s) 
 to
 Loading package evil...done (0.064s) 
 Of course, you can further increase GC threshold, but it won't make too much impact.
 ​
 So, I finally find a good use case for early-init.el . And here sharing with here. It would be interesting to see if it works for other fellows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After reading so many threads full of thoughtful and in-depth responses, I thought its was finally time to introduce myself. Greetings!
I have kept a paper zettelkasten for the past six months or so, which has benefitted from everyone's discourse and guidance here. So, thank you all! I hope to contribute a meager offering now and then to this already robust discussion forum.
Related to my zettelkasten, I use 3x5 index cards filed in an Amazon prime shipping box--it quickly became too unruly for a small file box. I also have experimented with some GTD task management systems in there as well, though my zettelkasten is still the star of the show. I file them using folgezettel numbering, which has proved to be a dangerous business, although I am beating it into submission slowly but surely. The folgezettel debates and related articles are quite fascinating.
The subject matter in my zettelkasten began, as is customary, with zettelkasten itself, but quickly branched out to catalog all of my various other record keeping systems: bullet journaling, morning pages, hobonichi 5-year, and filing methods. It's true that I am a stationary person first and foremost, and that's probably why I chose a paper system.
I also am particularly interested in how one might use the zettelkasten to chronicle their own personal experiences in the world to create meaning. I found How to Take Smart Notes rather confining in that it had a strong bias towards synthesizing academic research. I'd like to pivot away from academic towards the subjective. I hope maybe by using my zk to record stories and experiences, it could one day contribute to a work of fiction or memoire.
Anyways, looking forward to continuing to follow this forum and learning from everyone's expertise! Cheers!]]></summary>

It provides a configurable live preview of an org mode exported to HTML using the xwidget browser in Emacs. I wrote this for personal use but decided to continue to improve my elisp skills.
 Please give it a try if you're interested! Still a work-in-progress but it is good enough for my uses. I would also really appreciate any elisp/code suggestions, there are a lot of silly things I think I did in the code but I really don't know better and am trying to learn.
 Hope this helps someone, and if not here's a fun chance to pick apart some sub-par elisp (please, go for it!)

 And yes, I can see how some people might not find this useful, but I enjoy using it in some special cases I find myself in. Use in good health.

As I prepare to apply for internships for next summer, I'm wondering if it would be a bad idea to prepare for leetcode-style questions in Haskell.
 Does anyone have experience using it in a "regular" internship interview? (By regular I mean ones where you don't expect to use any Haskell in the job.)
 I guess I'm worried that either the interviewer will just decline to let me use the language, or otherwise let me but still have a negative view of it. In that case I could offer to use a more mainstream language, but I'd be less practiced in it.
 But I also think using Haskell and it's type system helps me tremendously in thinking through difficult problems, so in that way I could see it as an advantage.
 Any advice from either side (interns or interviewers) would be great. Thanks!

 So I was working through the Roguelike tutorials...
 Field of view in a roguelike
 ...and thought the engine performance could be better - quite normal - every time I build a new type of game I find new ways that Indigo could be better. Tweaked Indigo to change how it deals with large arrays destined for the GPU. While I was there I fixed some other stuff ...and also added the ability to dynamically load shaders. Here are the release notes:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.9.0
 That allowed me to simplify the Roguelike Starterkit and make it faster (if anyone is following along, upgrade!):
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-roguelike-starterkit
 ...but with the new dynamic shader loading I realised I could also solve another problem I'd been wondering about: How to share live Indigo shader demos?
 Thought it would be fun to have a little website that rendered Indigo flavoured shaders from GitHub gists (no backend, GitHub does the storage, easy peasy...), but website building for me means using Tyrian (an Elm-like web framework), and that also needed an upgrade:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.2.0
 ...but I did eventually build the site:
 https://purplekingdomgames.github.io/shadergist/?gist=davesmith00000/5a6b585dbc2184a2c215b16a91234c22
 And thus all the yaks were shaved. Back to game building.

 The interface would need to be bidirectional in the sense that I could run certain commands and type certain things into the interface (although be constrained to not be able to type arbitrary text since not all text would correspond to a graph) and have the graph database be updated according to what I had entered, but also, if some external program updated the graph database, the displayed textual representation should be updated as necessary.

 Its goal is to make mocking functions possible in the context of any monad and with as little boilerplate as possible.
 It is inspired by how easy mocking is in the Python or JS. The mocks are dispatched dynamically by name and type. Only the call site and the test cases are aware of a mock, so the changes are small and never require restructuring of the application for testing.
 I wrote it to make writing tests more enjoyable and I hope you enjoy it too!
 PS: [ANN #2] to record the arguments of the function calls and expecting calls, typeable-mock needs to process the arguments and result of arbitrary functions. The solution turned out to be more general than mocks needed, so I published it as a separate library https://hackage.haskell.org/package/variadic-function

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I'm trying to obfuscate some data in a dataset to practise Haskell and I'm running into some difficulties, particularly with regards to memoisation.
 The dataset contains some IP addresses which I want to anonymise by shuffling the last octet (e.g., mapping 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.231) and some email addresses, where I want to tokenise the username (e.g., mapping alice@gmail.com to v38j8a@gmail.com, where v38j8a is just a string generated randomly). Importantly, these IPs and email addresses can appear numerous times, and I want to mapping to be 1-1 (e.g, alice@gmail.com is always mapped to v38j8a@gmail.com). It seems pretty clear that I need to memoize my obfuscation functions.
 I've written some parsers and such that takes care of all this but without any memoization. I'm trying to use the MemoTrie library, but I'm running into difficulty - as I'm making heavy use of System.Random, basically everything I'm working with is in the IO monad, and MemoTrie seems to have little support for that. I can memoize an Int -> Int function but not an Int -> IO Int.
 Would anyone here know how to extend MemoTrie to support the IO monad? The MemoTrie documentation for adding your own data types isn't great and it's unclear how to write a sensible implementation of HasTrie. Alternatively, I can get the results that I want in a relatively straightforward manner by just using unsafePerformIO. Is this a reasonable solution? It feels kind of 'dirty' using unsafePerformIO, but I can't immediately see any negative consequences that might arise in this setting.
 Thanks very much for any help.
 Edit: an example of using MemoTrie and unsafePerformIO to handle the IO monad can be seen here: https://github.com/ocharles/dhall-build/blob/master/MemoIO.hs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fellow emacsers. 
 After researching into ergonomic split keyboards and keyboard customizations (I will probably buy a keyboardio model 100), I'm playing with the idea of trying key chords in emacs, but found not much about it in the wild wild web. 
 In this case key chords means 2 simultaneously pressed keys without modifiers as in https://github.com/emacsorphanage/key-chord.
 Those chords can be mapped to any command, so for example, in Spanish gh is a very uncommon pair. So we could map that to save-buffer, making it faster and easier (in a Dvorak layout) than C-x C-s.
 Does any of you tried it? If you did, what worked for you and what didn't? 
 As always, thank you very much for your time, attention and knowledge sharing... :)
 PD: edited to make it clearer what "chording" means in this question. Thanks /u/7890yuiop :)

 The txt file has records for each country, new cases, new deaths each day, date, total number of deaths etc.
 I'm struggling to find a way to display the results. I have searched online and found that the basic step would be to something similar to:
 import scala.io.Source
 val lines = Source.fromFile("/Users/Al/.bash_profile").getLines.toList
 How can I extract specific record from txt file? Any kind of help would be appreciated thankyou

 There are many ways to do the things in org-mode, maybe I am just doing it in a "wrong" way. How do you convert from org to md?

I don't have a Zettelkasten, yet (not sure if I ever will have).  I love to read what others are saying about their adventures.  Reading the discussions, in that and other threads, sometimes makes my head hurt.  I'm not sure if I'm smart enough to think so abstractly about such things.  I admire all those here who share their thoughts about how they think about thinking.
I did not want to interrupt or hijack that discussion, but I would like to share my initial reaction:  "What would a Shared Zettelkasten look like?".
I think that I understand, from what I've read here, and elsewhere, that a Zettelkasten is a personal database, where one keeps notes and builds upon research and thoughts which are read and created while living life.  The hope is to generate and discover new and interesting things while revisiting and exploring new and unfamiliar territory.
The basis of my question is, why should everyone have to start from zero and build upon things that they happen to discover.  The "standing on the shoulders of giants" resonates with me.  I'm just wondering if there is some way to share a Zettelkasten (or many).  Maybe this does not make any sense.  Maybe this already exists (Yahoo groups, Discord, Discourse, Reddit, etc.)?
Just wondering if anyone else has any similar thoughts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working with akka-stream and would like to define a Flow that takes some data from a Source and writes each record to another system. After all of the records have been written, I need to call a close() method. I'm running the stream with .runWith(Sink.ignore), and I'd like to ensure the runWith Future completes only after the close() method has completed.
 So far I've found two ways that seem like they could work with Flows: alsoToMat and watchTermination. In both cases, the runWith Future completes before the close method has completed.
 I've gotten it to work by using .toMat, but this turns the Flow into a Sink. I'd prefer to keep it as a Flow if possible.
 I wrote this up as an example App on Scastie: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/alexklibisz/baWl6EB7TkSjL7DMV2ZX5Q/2
 I appreciate that identifying the last element of a stream is a tricky problem. 
 It seems like there is some precedent for making this kind of thing work. For example, it seems that the FileSource can close a file handle before the full stream has completed. FileSource is implemented as a more complicated custom graph stage. I'd prefer to avoid that if possible, but I don't mind doing it if necessary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm currently working through a course that posts its material publicly online, and am working through the longest increasing subsequence problem. This problem is a little different than usual because it wants you to return a sequence and not just the length. I feel like I found the length in an efficient way, using dynamic programming. But because I am new to scala and not that great at algorithms, I don't think I constructed the subsequence efficiently. Here is my code: 
 /* * Assignment: Longest increasing subsequence * * Sequences are a natural source of computational problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using emacs 26.3 in Windows 10 (I work in a Windows intensive environment, and I had to give up the struggle of using Linux). And just this morning, for no reason that I can see, the second command C-f in a command sequence fails to register. 
 For example, I was editing a LaTeX file using AucTeX, which has C-x C-f C-e for entering emphasized text. But the second command key, the C-f, couldn't be entered. Emacs stopped at C-x and refused to accept another command key. 
 I closed Emacs down and restarted, and entered C-x C-f to access a file, and again, the C-f wouldn't register. It's not a problem with my keyboard: the f key works fine (see this post?) and the only changes to my .emacs file have been some minor font changes for font-lock-mode. 
 It seems to involve only C-f. Other sequences do work: C-x C-b for example, or C-x C-s. But C-x C-f is a sequence I use a lot, and I have no idea why it's not working. Any ideas? Thanks!

 M-x which-key-show-top-levelshows that key binding on page 2 of 8, but I found it accidentally.

 Is there a way to / search the top-level key bindings, without having to manually go through all 8 pages (via C-h j)?
 More generally, how can I find the most relevant ("context sensitive") key bindings? The usual C-h m is not too helpful in Doom Emacs (M-x calc) , as it simply shows the original key binding, followed by "that binding is currently shadowed by another mode".

 It's as close as I could get to a straight clone of ScalaTags with the twist that everything is done with macros at compile-time, so it reduces the runtime processing to mostly just concatenating literal strings with a few dynamic strings in an Array with a StringBuilder, with the upshot being that it's between 2 and 10 times faster at runtime than ScalaTags (which is already quite quick) depending on the exact nature of the workload it's given.

 when bound to a key in the re-builder window can go straight into regexp query replace (as described in the post). 
 One thing which would make it nicer imo is for the re-builder window to quit after the query replace is done -- currently, after the query replace finishes one is left in the target window with the replacement still highlighted so one has to switch to the re-builder and then quit the re-builder. I tried raising the save-excursion call before selecting the target window but that isn't cutting it - anyone know a simple/clean way without hardc-oding buffer names and such?
 for reference, here is the unaltered function def:
  (defun reb-query-replace-this-regxp (replace) "Uses the regexp built with re-builder to query the target buffer. This function must be run from within the re-builder buffer, not the target buffer. Argument REPLACE String used to replace the matched strings in the buffer. Subexpression references can be used (\1, \2, etc)." (interactive "sReplace with: ") (if (eq major-mode 'reb-mode) (let ((reg (reb-read-regexp))) (select-window reb-target-window) (save-excursion (beginning-of-buffer) (query-replace-regexp reg replace))) (message "Not in a re-builder buffer!")))

 My team sits in front office and has about 20 Haskell devs (well, technically Mu, our in-house variant). We work in close collaboration with trading, sales, and structuring to build diverse software, from desktop GUI applications to server-side financial analytics reports and services. For this role we expect hands-on experience with a couple of large Haskell / OCaml projects, and/or managing a team.
 Feel free to reach out to me directly if you're interested and have any questions, but applications should go via this link: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100017588
 A more junior role that I advertised before, also in London, is still open: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100012204
 Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll (UK in this case), and after an initial 3-month in-office period. We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful applicants.

 Category are distinct agenda elements, so it is possible to perhaps create a face for them?
 By the way, I often use org-super-agenda. I don't think org-super-agenda can handle this issue, but I am not very familiar with its line formatting capabilties.

 The exception is being thrown against the line below
 D01/08/2017 T-575.00 PInlingua M N CR LMonthly Bills:education 
 It's throwing based on the last case. In the file below https://github.com/galbarm/YNAB4toGnuCashMigrationTool/blob/master/src/main/scala/YNABTransaction.scala 
 The case: 
 case _ => assert(L.exists(_.startsWith("Income:Available")), s"payee transaction must have an income category: $this") 
 I've never used scala or java really but is that saying L should start with Income:Available if the payee exists?

 I just published (on Hackage) my first ever Haskell library, StrongPath, which provides a strongly typed representation of file paths, providing more safety during compile time than standard FilePath (well, String).
 It is heavily inspired by path library, which we used in Wasp-lang a lot and loved it, but then we wanted even more type safety so I ended up creating StrongPath.
 I still consider myself relatively new to writing production-level Haskell code so I would appreciate more experienced among you taking a look and giving some advice on what could be improved!
 Source code: https://github.com/wasp-lang/strong-path
 Some specific things I would love to get a second thought on:
 1. I ended up with a lot of duplication / boilerplate in the code, repeating same / similar logic …]]></summary>

 I'm into a research internship based on Haskell for my master's degree. Short version: we would like to work on an implementation for a linear type system (https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/linear-types/roadmap). 
 First question: I've been studying Haskell for a few months and I'm trying to go deep into the GHC. What is the starting point? You have any good resources for a better understanding of what it does?
 Second question: this is the first time that I try to "extend" a compiler. I'm excited but also a bit scared. What is the "protocol"? There is something that i should know? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance for the help!

 Has someone played/experimented with emacs-pcre? 
 emacs-pcre uses libpcre, nicely compiles, works and gives the complete Perl Compatible RegEx feature set (as opposed to pcre2el) to emacs.
 Sadly the (user) commands, which would make emacs-pcre convenient are completely missing from the package.
 This is sad, because all the power those missing user commands could give.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody, after having built some web applications with Scala/Scala.js, we started stripping common functionality out into a reusable template.
 While this is similar to bootzooka, the main difference is the tech stack.
 For anyone that hasn't tried building web apps in Scala.js, let me tell you that it is a lovely experience, having worked with several JavaScript frameworks before, I couldn't be happier with Scala.js + Slinky (React) + Scalablytyped.
 There is still lots of stuff to do but if we focus on getting it perfect, we wouldn't get to a release date ever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that Zettels should be about one thought, and that if you create a Zettel about an idea but already have a Zettel about the idea, you should incorporate the details from the new Zettel into the old one.
However, I'm in doubt about how to best handle in-text citations. E.g.: In my first, failed Zettelkasten attempt, I had a Zettel on the Feynman Technique. In that Zettel, I cited some random blog post I found. I had doubts about the technique, so I read another random blog post. This resulted in a Zettel that looked something like this:
Some description of what the technique is about [citekey1][citekey2].

The steps:

1. do x [citekey1][citekey2].
2. do y [citekey1][citekey2]. Optionally, do z [citekey1].
3. do a [citekey1][citekey2].
4. do b [citekey2].

You do step number two because of reason c [citekey2].

I ask:
If I had wanted to show how the two sources differed in their description of the technique, was the resulting Zettel the best way to do so, or should I have made separate Zettels for each source?
In general, how should I approach citations in my Zettelkasten so I don't question what I do like in the scenario described?
I appreciate your comments in advance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm disturbed by the Haskell Foundation accepting sponsorship from IOHK, a company incorporated in Hong Kong.
 The recent suppression of free speech and democratic activism in Hong Kong has been condemned publicly by the leaders of many Western nations, including the USA, UK and Australia. The arrests conducted under this new law seem arbitrarily targeted, and many commentators have described them as being directed by President Xi personally, to suppress dissent.
 However, IOHK is still incorporated in Hong Kong, despite being (to use their own description) "a fully decentralised remote working organisation". IOHK appears to be well-funded, having (again, from their website) "400+ people across 50+ countries", and therefore would appear to have had every opportunity to leave Hong Kong, if they did not support the actions of the CCP.
 In the past, people on this subreddit have loudly and forcefully condemned US-based companies like Facebook, and US defense contractors, for their use of Haskell, and have stated they would not work for those companies.
 Is anyone else equally disturbed by this funding arrangement for the Haskell Foundation? At what point would it become disturbing to accept money from a remote company that is happily headquartered in an authoritarian regime?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't like that I have to choose between using the easy to use minor modes like `display-battery-mode` and `lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable` versus setting `modeline-format`. I still want the info from lsp-modeline for example, I just want to tweak the spacing and such of the modeline.
 Is there a way to mess with the modeline without resorting to modeline-format, or is there a way to get the info that lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable adds to the modeline so I can create a custom one without reinventing all these nice modeline modes?

Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

 Now I want to specify it in the org file so I don't have to type out the command each time I open Emacs, how can it be done? I googled it to no avail, some anwers show a piece of lisp code but I have no idea where to put it and the manual page I've found is not too clear as well.
 I'm using vanilla Emacs with no customizations.

Today, I see the Devonthink for Historians Youtube channel posted some thoughts about keeping a Zettelkasten.
Being new to the way of the Zettel, I don't know if their ideas match well with the Zettelkasten community.
It was interesting to hear them talk about "evolutionary sifting," which I think is probably similar to the Zettelkasten Boy Scout rule, leaving notes better than you found them.
Anyway, if it's of interest -  .]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in the process of learning Haskell and I just had an epiphany but I want to make sure I haven't quite gone off the deep end yet.
 To compare it to C#, a Monad is what an Interface is to a Class in C#, but with all inherited behavior fully defined in the Interface.
 The four Monad operations that I am aware of in Haskell, >>=, >>, return and fail, are used to programatically add and change an Interface onto a set of data, or Class in C#.
 This allows a clean set of data to have any interface attached to it and have whatever predefined behavior performed on that data.
 Let me know if I am about right or pretty far off!

 Okay, recursion is so much more concise...
 reverseList list = if length list < 2 then list else last list : reverseList (init list)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I updated org yesterday from 9.4.4 to 9.4.6 and found that when marking a recurring task done, it was permanently marked DONE instead of having its timestamp updated and todo status left as TODO. An inactive timestamp was also recorded in the logbook, but LAST_REPEAT in the properties drawer was not updated.
 Looking at the version 9.4 release notes, I saw that org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region now defaults to t. I checked the docstring, as the release notes suggest, and while I can't say that I found it very enlightening, something told me I should try changing it. I set it to nil and marking tasks done in their own file buffer started to work as before, but marking them done from the agenda was still a problem. Reading a little further, I saw a new and related variable, also defaulting to t, called org-agenda-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region. I set that to nil and now everything seems to be working as before.
 Still, after reading the docstrings and the manual, I don't understand what these variables really do. Plus, since the release notes are for 9.4 I imagine they were already defaulting to t in 9.4.4, which worked fine for me. Finally, I cannot seem to find anybody else having reported the same problem. All of which is to say that I am not confident that I have really solved it. Maybe I "solved" a side-effect of another problem instead?
 Can anybody give me a bit of insight that will either give me confidence in my solution or help me find the real problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I just started learning Haskell few weeks ago and first worked through the LYAH and now go through the recommended wikibook from the official Haskell site and solve along the 99 problems and some codewars (I hope this is a good approach right now). 
 To learn to build something more real world and less synthetic, I decided to create a small web app where users can rate and comment on courses from my university and then went looking for an appropriate framework. In the official wiki I found https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/ which looks like an incredible piece of software engineering and I immediately watched their 25 minute video of demonstration and quite fell in love with it. BUT I am worried that using this would take away a lot of classical Haskell, because to me it seems a lot like Django or similar frameworks. With their different custom syntax operators like |> I feel like I’d be more learning their framework than actually Haskell. Is that a legitimate concern? My main goal is not to build a wonderful web app that makes me $$$ but just to build something with Haskell that is useful and that I can extend over time. 
 Would a more lightweight framework be more appropriate and if so which? Is my impression of it not being really haskelly wrong? It feels like a lot of what makes haskell awesome has been abstracted away for ease of usage which is great for production but probably not for learning. 
 I hope my question is clear and you can understand my concern. Thanks for any input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On my home network I have two computers, both running Windows 10.
 On the desktop computer, I've got VcXsrv and WSL1 running, and I have the Linux build of Gnu Emacs 27.1 running under WSL and displaying through X Windows.
 On the laptop computer, I've got VcXsrv running.
 On the emacs on the desktop, I run M-x make-frame-on-display to pop up a frame on the laptop. This way, I have only one instance of emacs running, and I can view and edit the same buffers from both computers without worry of getting my files out of sync. (I tend to pace my apartment while I work, so it's nice to be able to access my buffers from two different rooms.)
 Unfortunately, when the laptop goes to sleep, the emacs on the desktop computer freezes for a few seconds and then crashes.
 What would you suggest as a workaround or fix?
 (Please don't suggest "delete the frame on the laptop before putting the laptop to sleep". Yes that would presumably work but I won't remember to do that.)

 thanks much for your help
 the table structure looks like this

One question I had though is that when there's a 'fix available' (currently editing c++ code) and it tells me the fix to perform, what's the command/shortcut for doing such fix? Apologies for the stupid question I've been using emacs for a few months now and have always just worked with my own (pretty poor) config and am just now realizing what lsp is and why it's useful lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, currently learning Haskell and pretty much everywhere I look I am told that one should avoid explicit recursion and try and use functional abstractions like fold or map.
 This has caused me some pain when, as an exercise, I was implementing the library function dropWhile. My initial implementation using explicit recursion looked like this:
 dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a] dropWhile _ [] = [] dropWhile p xs@(x:xs') | p x = dropWhile' p xs' | otherwise = xs 
 This also seems to match the implementation used in the GHC source code.
 After some perusing I found an example using foldr as follows:
 dropWhile :: (a -> Bool )-> [a] -> [a] dropWhile p = fst . foldr f ([], []) where f x ~(xs,ys) = (if p x then xs else x:ys, x:ys) 
 After some head wracking I do understand the second definition. However I would like to know if this is a situation in which the implementation using explicit recursion is preferable as it is easier to reason about?

 But sometimes I want to use links with $NEXT instead of \very\long\path\to\Nextcloud in them and that seems to not really work. 
 Is there a way to make this work?

 ## Heading {#heading} 
 What I really want is just
 ## Heading 
 After reading the docs, I thought that the https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/usage/#org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading is responsible for setting this behaviour. But when I look through counsel-describe-variable, this variable doesn't show up in the list.
 Anyways, I've tried setting the variable via these two methods:
 Setting it in my config.el
 (use-package ox-hugo :ensure t :after ox :custom (org-hugo-base-dir ".") (org-hugo-front-matter-format "yaml") (org-hugo-section "braindump") (org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading "")) 
 Setting it in .dir-locals.el
 ((nil . ((org-hugo-base-dir . ".") (org-hugo-front-matter-format . "yaml") (org-hugo-section . "braindump") (org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading ""))) 
 But no luck.
 I've posted this issue in the ox-hugo github here https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/449 but I figured maybe I can get a quicker response here since I think the issue is coming from my config not the package.
 EDIT:
 The author of the library replied in the GitHub issue. There is a way to disable it. But it doesn't help me in my overall goal. Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying (with the blessing of the cabal maintainers and the haskell foundation) to spearhead an initiative to re-vamp the cabal documentation. Right now it is a combination of reference material, and a user guide. It would be nice to have a beginner friendly, linear guide that walks a newcomer through the most common use cases of cabal.
 I am trying to keep on top of the issue tracker and provide plenty of context. The first three sections have all their required chapters recorded in the issue tracker https://github.com/haskell/cabal-userguide/issues
 I plan on adding the more advanced chapters as issues later, but if anyone feels especially strongly about contributing those it would be greatly appreciated. They can be found in the SUMMARY.md https://github.com/haskell/cabal-userguide/blob/main/src/SUMMARY.md
 I want this project to be friendly to beginner contributors, so if you want to take an issue and learn as you write it, I would love that and will be happy to offer any guidance I can (as well as coercing more senior cabal contributors to offer input).
 Thanks everyone, I think this is a really important initiative to improve the haskell ecosystem for the uninitiated and the old guard alike!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post describes how to use OBazl to
build OCaml projects with Bazel.
Compared to the first OCaml ruleset published in
2016, which contains only a few basic rules, OBazl is under active development
and aims to provide highly granular, low-level control over the build, and
eventually automatically generate build files.
It is therefore a practical choice to enjoy Bazel’s incremental, parallel,
cacheable and remote building capacities.
However, it is in its early stages, requiring manual work for some tasks that
will be automated in the future.
To exemplify its usage, I will show how to convert the build of the
uri package to Bazel. Since OCaml and
Bazel is not a frequent combination, I will give an introduction to Bazel, as
well as some aspects of compiling OCaml modules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to setup emacs for develop using Dart. I've already installed Flutter & Dart on my system, so I'm trying to setup lsp-dart.
 This is my init.el file:
 ;; Install use-package (condition-case nil (require 'use-package) (file-error (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/")) (package-initialize) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install 'use-package) (require 'use-package))) (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t) (use-package lsp-dart :ensure t :hook (dart-mode . lsp)) ;; Optional packages (use-package projectile :ensure t) ;; project management (use-package yasnippet :ensure t :config (yas-global-mode)) ;; snippets (use-package lsp-ui :ensure t) ;; UI for LSP (use-package company :ensure t) ;; Auto-complete ;; Optional Flutter packages (use-package hover :ensure t) ;; run app from desktop without emulator 
 which I copy-pasted from the emacs-lsp's github page.
 The problem is that I retrieve this error:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install lsp-dart: Package ‘lsp-dart-’ is unavailable Error (use-package): Failed to install projectile: Package ‘projectile-’ is unavailable Error (use-package): Cannot load projectile 
 and I cannot figure how to resolve it. 
 I've tried to install projectile using M-x package-install RET projectile RET (after enabling MELPA), but I get an error saying that projectile-2.3.0 cannot be found, while the MELPA website says that the projectile current version is 2.4.0.
 ​
 What am I missing?

 (I'm not English, so sorry for eventual errors)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing around with fancy record libaries and was very impressed with how well labels can infer types. Probably because it avoids unnecessary complexity and less-frequently-used operations.
 So I wanted to try how much unnecessary complexity and infrequently operations I could throw on top of it while maintaining reasonable type inference. Going back-and-forth between tuples and hlists mostly works but I ran into some troubles with the union operation.
 union:: (IsHList a l, IsHList b r, IsHList c (Concat l r)) => a -> b -> c -- infers nicely union l r -- infers nicely union l _ :: ("foo" := String, "bi" := String, "bar" := Int, "baz" := Double) -- uh oh union _ r :: ("foo" := String, "bi" := String, "bar" := Int, "baz" := Double) 
 The blame lies with this type family implementation which recurses on the first argument:
 type family Concat l r where Concat '[] a = a Concat (x ': xs) a = x ': Concat xs a 
 I found a way to make it work by going through type classes. If someone wants to try for themselves, here is a test case:
 l :: Proxy '[1,2] l = Proxy r :: Proxy '[3,4] r = Proxy cat :: IConcat a b c => Proxy a -> Proxy b -> Proxy c cat _ _ = Proxy c1 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] c1 = cat l _ -- _ :: Proxy '[3,4] c2 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] c2 = cat _ r -- _ :: Proxy '[1,2] c3 = cat l r -- c3 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] 
 And here is my solution https://gist.github.com/Tarmean/fc553829a044979e9c5c8b4d226270b1
 You might notice that my solutions is an ugly pile of hacks. Does anyone know of a cleaner/less silly solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to hear about the layouts you've selected, particularly the placement of modifiers to be harmonious with Emacs keystrokes.
 Background, for normal, sane people who don't know what I'm talking about:
 One rabbit-hole on the edge of the custom / mechanical keyboard world is minimizing the number of keys so your fingers never have to stray far from the home row. Some boards, like the Ferris, have only 34 or 36 keys so you are never more than one key away.
 These keyboards make heavy use of 'layers' - additional custom 'modifier' keys you hold down to generate numbers, symbols, arrow and function keystrokes etc..
 For this, keys do double-duty where tapping generates a character, but holding down applies a modifier. E.g. you may have shift on F, so tapping F makes an f character, but holding it down while tapping another key it applies shift to that other key. This is referred to as "home row modifiers". Typically you'd make it symmetrical, with J as another shift, so you can use opposing hands for modifier and keystroke.
 But with Emacs, you often type modifier-key sequences that travel around the keyboard, like C-x C-k, for which alternating hands would be awkward. So I'm interested in the directions people have gone with their own keymap and what they've settled on.
 I'm playing with a Ferris Sweep, developing my own keymap, mostly as a 'game' in my spare time, but it may yet work out and become my working keyboard. I'm thinking of having Ctrl on a thumb just to deal with these Emacs sequences.

I noticed that the official quick start giter8 template akka/akka-quickstart-scala.g8 uses Scala version 2.13.1 
 I have attempted to add Akka dependencies to the Scala 3 template scala/scala3.g8 and also attempted to change the Scala version number in the Akka template but both result in unresolved dependencies and failed to build.
 Is there a way to get Scala 3 and Typed Akka up and running with current versions (I saw an older unofficial template from 2019 using Dotty but nothing more recent)?
 If I must I can postpone using Scala 3 to a later project. It is more vital that this use Akka than that it use Scala 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I've been working through Types and Programming Languages by Pierce lately and really enjoying it. Throughout the book you work through the theory and implementation of the lambda calculus, the simply typed lambda calculus and it's variants (including System F). However as far as the implementation of these languages go you only go as far as implementing type checkers and parsers to form ASTs in OCaml (translating the code in the book to Haskell is fairly easy). 
 I'm interested in learning more about how functional languages like Haskell are compiled to something lower level in the real world, different techniques used for memory and speed optimisations often talked about on this subreddit, how to "desugar" syntax into it's core IR language (like system F) prior to compiling it to something lower level.. all that jazz.. I've considered picking up a book/course on compilers however a lot of them have an inclination towards compiling imperative and OO languages which I have no interest in doing. I came across this http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/ which seems to match up to exactly what I'm looking for. However I can see it's been discontinued or the author has other priorities at the moment.
 Is there an alternative to Write You a Haskell? Or something that can at least serve as a complement to TAPL? I'm interested in learning more about LLVM if that option is available since it's interesting to me that some modern languages like Rust are compiled to/with LLVM.
 I'm aware of this https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-implementation-of-functional-programming-languages/ however fear it may be outdated. Correct me if I'm wrong.
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I'm asking the impossible:
 Does anyone have any Emacs configs that would make Emacs so easy to use, that normal people like my partner would be able to utilize it for their daily TODO lists?
 I'm talking GUI friendly options, sane normal people keyboard shortcut choices, and even the ability to totally ignore normal Emacs regular keybindings.
 I ask because I was showing off what Org Mode could do, but was told that it looked too complicated to use.
 Does anyone have any links to some super-easy-to-use user-friendly Emacs configs that would be mouse and GUI based? (I know, its sacrilege but hey, gotta try somehow).
 I know Emacs without a config has the context menu which is fine, but yeah, looking for some tips in this department. This person was debating using it for TODO lists for work, and also maybe for writing scripts for TV shows, etc.
 Thanks.

As I get started I am reminded why I f**king hate TypeScript/JavaScript so much. I'd say between not being that good at FE to begin with and having to manage dumb error messages I am losing velocity. I'd love to develop this in Scala.JS and Laminar as it’s so much simpler and I already know Scala fairly well, but I am worried that if when the MVP needs to scale and onboard new developers I will have trouble finding any. Should I just suck it up and use React? Part of me feels like I am putting the cart in front of the horse worrying about what will happen if this product will get funding when it hasn't yet.

https://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/
 https://copilot.github.com/
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27676266
  
I am looking for some help bundling this up as an emacs package and ongoing work on connecting GPT-j (and others) to various emacs libraries.
 I personally believe GPT-3+vscode is an emacs killer. That is not the view of everybody here. But I believe emacs is a much better platform for building this stuff, so please help! Thanks.

 Please contact me to join the organisation if you want access.
 Pushing your own branch will run tests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm playing around with readability when reading large blocks of text in emacs, and sometimes the lines kind of blur together for me when I'm reading. I think coloring each sentence a different color would help me keep track of my place without needing to actively highlight each line. As far as I can tell, the only way to do this is with some implementation of faces. However, it looks like each face is assigned to a single color, so I would have to figure out how to switch to a different face for each sentence in a paragraph. The fact that I'm doing all of this within org-mode kinda complicates things too, since I only want this to apply to paragraphs, not other elements.
 Has anyone else attempted to do anything similar to this? Is there a better way to approach this?

 I want to have the same mappings I have on Neovim. I'm using general.el and my leader key is the spacebar. And I want to map spacebar to do fuzzy search, so by just pressing double spacebar I'm searching for a file (similar to doom-emacs amd what I have on my neovim config). 
 Can't figure what is the syntax for mapping the spacebar. For setting the leader key, using SPC worked, but doesn't work for mapping spacebar after the prefix. 
 Here's how I have defined my leader key.
 (use-package general :config (general-evil-setup t) (general-create-definer rune/leader-keys :global-prefix "SPC")) 
 And here are the mappings I have:
 (rune/leader-keys 'normal "b" '(:ignore b :which-key "buffers") "bb" '(counsel-switch-buffer :which-key "all buffers") "bs" '(save-buffer :which-key "save buffer") "bq" '(kill-current-buffer :which-key "quit buffer") "/" '(swiper :which-key "search in buffer")) 
 What I have tried:
 "SPC" '(counsel-fzf :which-key "search file") "<space>" '(counsel-fzf :which-key "search file") 
 That last one I tried:
 (kbd "SPC") '(counsel-fzf :which-key "search file") 
 Those don't work, can anyone point me in the right direction ? Thanks.

 I now have an idea for what I think would be a relatively small GHC extension that I would like to have a crack at as a first attempt at actually modifying GHC's source code: CoercibleStrings. The outcome would be similar in spirit to that of the existing OverloadedStrings GHC extension, however, the latter I believe "only" infers the type (Data.String.IsString a) => a for a string literal l during type checking and then desugars them to fromString l, where fromString :: (Data.String.IsString a) => String -> a is from the typeclass Data.String.IsString.

 I've been trying to get company-mode to only trigger completion on tab. This is my set up, which does pretty much what I want:
 ```lisp (use-package company :defer t :diminish "" :hook ((prog-mode) . (lambda () (company-mode))) :config (setq tab-always-indent 'complete) (setq company-idle-delay nil) (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 3) :bind (:map company-mode-map ("<tab>" . 'company-indent-or-complete-common) :map company-active-map ("C-n" . 'company-select-next-or-abort) ("C-j" . 'company-select-next-or-abort) ("C-p" . 'company-select-previous-or-abort) ("C-k" . 'company-select-previous-or-abort)))
 (use-package company-prescient :defer t :hook (company-mode . company-prescient-mode)) ```
 The only problem now is that yasnippets are borked up: tab triggers company, which doesn't test to see if it can expand as yasnippet first. Is there any way for me to get this working how I'd like?
 Edit: better minimal example

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious if there's a way to convert a tuple into a "type map".
 Example:
  val t: (Int, (String, Double)) = (3, ("Pi", 3.14)) val m = toTypeMap(t) val i: Int = m.get[Int] // returns 3 val s: String = m.get[String] // returns "Pi" val d: Double = m.get[Double] // returns 3.14 
 toTypeMap(t) should only compile if t contains no duplicate types, i.e. wouldn't compile for an (Int, Int). Calling get[T] should only compile if the tuple contains the type T. 
 Perhaps "type map" is not the canonical name for this. What I'm thinking of is something like ZIO's Env, basically a Map that lets you retrieve elements based on the type of the element.
 edit: the tuple doesn't necessarily have to be "nested"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've been using Emacs for a long time but my needs are not that fancy so my understanding of it is not that great. I'm mostly using it to edit DNS (bind) and configuration files. 
 I have for a long time had this peculiar thing come up. In most of my dns zone files the TAB key acts as I want, ie when you press TAB the cursor moves 8 characters to the right, (from position 1) when you move the marker with arrow left it jumps back to position 1, and if you press TAB again it jumps 8 characters to the right again.
 But in some files when I press TAB the marker moves to something like position 16. Now when you press arrow left the marker goes to the left as if the space is filled with spaces. If you try to press TAB again nothing happens.
 I've been trying to read the documentation on how to program the TAB key but I haven't been able to solve the problem.

It would be useful because it would be possible to move the cursor exactly in the position of a specific character using a evil-mode shortcut, pressing a number and h/l to move right or left a specific number of times. I have yet the distance from current line for every line, using linum, but i think that even this feature would be useful.

 In truth I hope to stay ahead of the tutorial to make sure the starter kit has all the tools needed for anyone else having a go. I have to make sure it works somehow!

 I don't mind some code which can change the configuration on the fly, perhaps I can use Cw for cases when I want to see dashes as regular letters of a word and use cw for the standard usage.

I’m not a coder or programmer. I write and edit legal documents for a living. I have installed a dark theme and some add-ons.
 I’ve started using it for its text editing capabilities, but I am impressed with its extensible features as well. It has now become my go-to for most html browsing and I also browse Gemini capsules and Gopher holes with it. I really like the file manager, built-in terminal (I use a lot of tui apps out of preference), multimedia and internet radio support, org-mode which I am using to write unit meeting agendas, as well as the built in games.
 I’m looking for suggestions for additional extensions that work with my use case as I would like to use Emacs for the majority of my workflow rather than rely on multiple tui and GUI applications. Additional game recommendations would be welcome as well.
 Emacs seems like an another OS within my OS (I use Fedora at home and when I telework).
 Initially I thought that Emacs would be “too hard and complicated” but I have enjoyed the tutorial and documentation. I feel like I am just scratching the surface.

 It's still experimental and ready for library authors and interested hackers to kick the tires and build real-time applications with it.
 Future plans include: - handling user-defined types - libraries based on conduit and other popular streaming packages
 Thanks for taking a look. And thanks to this community. I built this library from scratch on my stream and am grateful for those who've been watching and cheering me on. This is a library I've wanted for a while and I hope you enjoy it too!

 How do correctly set that path so that the homebrew paths always appear?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never used EXWM, but if I'm not wrong it allows you to switch between different workspaces, where each workspace has its own frame configuration. For instance, I can do a vertical split in workspace 1, than move to workspace 2 which will be a new empty frame, not vertically splitted. Then, if I want I can move back to workspace 1 and find again the vertical split and the buffers opened in that workspace. I didn't manage to find anything similar to this for regular Emacs, every time I want to open a new empty frame without changing the configuration of the frame I'm currently using, I need to open a new Emacs X window, while I would like to do everything in the same Emacs window. Why you don't just use EXWM, you might ask. Because for now I'm quite skeptical about its usefulness for me, so I want to take my time to understand if it's something that might actually improve my workflow. In the meanwhile, I would really love a feature like the one described above. I started only very recently to use Emacs so sorry if the feature I'm looking for is something obvious or basic. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've been playing around with emacs for a few days, mainly with org-mode, and I really like it and the idea of it. But, I've barely scratched the surface. I thought a way for me to get into using emacs would be learning a new language, and looked into C++. I found this great guide for using C++ with emacs, but frankly I'm a bit intimidated by how many extensions and how much configuration are required. It makes me want to just use a more standard IDE.
 I guess I have two questions for more experienced users: 1. Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is coding with emacs at odds with using an IDE, and I should be looking at a different work flow entirely, rather than forcing emacs to have ide like features? 2. What sort of stands out for folks as the reason it was worth climbing up the emacs learning curve?

 M-x xref-find-definitions 
 in any buffer of any major mode. For example, running that function on 
 xref-find-definitions 
 in the info buffer causes emacs to return with
 Find definitions of (default xref-find-definitions): 
 so we hit <RET> and are shown 
 Visit tags table (default TAGS): /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/info 
 hit that <RET> again and we get 
 File /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/info/TAGS does not exist 
 (note that running 
 xref-etags-mode 
 doesn't change anything)
 now I'm aware this has to do something with the 'etags' shell command, but this only creates a tags table in a specific working directory. How would I configure so that I have a global tags table so that anywhere I could run 
 xref-find-definitions 
 and go take a look at the course code of a function?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Emacs lovers, I've updated the top-up for the Inside Emacs videos by adding the files and commands used in the last 3 videos on org-table I uploaded recently.
 This top-up is for you if you like the videos and:
  
you want the list of the commands used in the videos,
 or you want to practice your Emacs workflow by reproducing some of the actions in the videos with the files I've used.
  
For instance, if you're interested on trying the commands related to exporting tables in org-mode we discussed in Inside Emacs #6 (part 6), you can:
  
find the commands in this section of the README,
 and try them with the org file org-table.org.
  
I hope this top-up can help you reduce the time between the moment you watched the video and the moment you're able to do what's in the video and much more.
 If there something missing in the top-up or you think of another way of presenting it, let me know.
 Have a nice day :)
