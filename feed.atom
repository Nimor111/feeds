Equivalence problems with StreamGraph by Jonathan Dowland
The StrIoT Logical Optimiser applies a set of rewrite rules to a stream-processing program, generating a set of variants that can be reasoned about, ranked, and deployed. The problem I’ve been tackling is that a variant may appear to be semantically equivalent to another, but compare (with ==) as distinct.

        <link href="https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2756/question-evolving-ideas-contradictions-how-to-manage-non-truth-in-a-zettelkasten"/>
        <updated>2023-12-13T22:51:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
I come to you, specialists and sages of the Zettelkasten, in a quest to understand something I cannot wrap my head around… 
I've read How to Take Smart Notes, I've practiced the method successfully for writing fiction, but there is something I cannot yet figure (or maybe need validation to implement?).
How do you manage that which you know you do not know, or do not know enough, or realize you did not know? That is:
How do you manage questions, which can be ongoing on life? ("How to be a good man in the 21st Century?")
How do you navigate and evolve forming practices? (Like: the Zettelkasten method, which you hone in through practice, and evolve insight: "this works for me, I should pay attention to that")
How do you walk back on ideas that do not serve you anymore, or that you realize were false? (like an early 20st Century scientist witnessing the ether being disproved, meaning all theories and constructs pertaining to it become completely irrelevant apart from scientific history)
I guess the underlying issue is "transient" content, which is a little bit at odds with the concept of permanent / evergreen note / Zettel. Now I know a Zettelkasten is personal, that truth is unattainable and everything is potentially transient – please bear with me here 🙂 I also know, in Luhmann's words, that the Zettelkasten is a "septic tank".
And yet. What would be best practices for capturing accruing, unformed ideas and questions, which would free the user by knowing they will not pollute the system down the road if they turn out to be dead ends?
Is it a simple matter of trusting that linking will isolate irrelevant content? Or should you prune links later, remove notes – but potentially destroying the path of thinking that led you to where you are now? Is it a much simpler matter of redirecting the energy of the system simply by altering the geometry of structure notes?
Any insight and especially technical approaches would be hugely appreciated. Thank you!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey
 I've working for the past couple of days on a tree-sitter based major mode for TLA+.
 From Wikipedia
  
TLA+ is a formal specification language developed by Leslie Lamport [the La of Latex] It is used for designing, modelling, documentation, and verification of programs, especially concurrent systems and distributed systems. 
  
And PlusCal 
  
PlusCal (formerly called +CAL) is a formal specification language, which transpiles to TLA+. PlusCal most resembles an imperative programming language
  
The mode offers syntax highlighting for most TLA+ / PlusCal Syntax, and basic imenu navigation. Code formatting is work in progress (TLA+ having significant indendation is in my point of view a significant challenge).
 Any feedback is welcome.
 The work is inspired by tla-mode, and this page  has been an invaluable help.
 PS. No idea how advent of code submission work here, so feel free to edit the title to use as as submission if it makes sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of curiosity, has anyone gotten the pdf-tools package work in Windows (specifically 10)? I've found a few options:
  
Trying to build with msys2 -- doesn't seem to like my msys2 configuration from Chocolatey. At the very least, it won't install and run make successfully.
 Tried out a precompiled pdf-tools -- this is about 5-6 years old at this date, and while there's libraries, and I added it to load-path and brought it in with require, it still was not particularly happy. It acted as if it'd never been properly installed.
  
Just curious. The baked in DocView is adequate for my needs as if I were to print it properly, I'd use a full PDF viewer like Sumatra. However DocView is pretty grainy in rendering and my eyes would appreciate it if I found a slightly better solution.
 I'm editing Typst documents with live PDF update, so it's nice to have another pane with the rendered document on the fly (mostly -- it's not the live update their website Rust app has, but it's close enough for me for now.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I am an IT student, and was given the task to install Leancheck. I managed to do that by following the instructions on: https://github.com/rudymatela/leancheck/blob/master/README.md
 Now it works if I do "ghci" and then "import Test.LeanCheck". 
 My problem arrised when I tried to do "stack ghci", which also is required by my professor. Typing "stack ghci" opens ghci, with the following message: 
 PS /filePath/> stack ghci
 ​
 Note: No local targets specified, so a plain ghci will be started with no package hiding or package options.
 ​
 You are using snapshot: lts-21.24
 ​
 If you want to use package hiding and options, then you can try one of the following:
 ​
 * If you want to start a different project configuration
 than /filePath/\stack\global-project\stack.yaml, then you can use stack init to create a new
 stack.yaml for the packages in the current directory.
 ​
 * If you want to use the project configuration
 at /filePath/\stack\global-project\stack.yaml, then you can add to its 'packages' field.
 ​
 Configuring GHCi with the following packages:
 GHCi, version 9.4.8: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/ :? for help
 Loaded GHCi configuration from /filePath/\stack\ghci-script\2a3bbd58\ghci-script
 ghci>
 Typing "import Tests.Leancheck" results in: 
 <no location info>: error:
 Could not find module `Tests.Leancheck'
 It is not a module in the current program, or in any known package. 
 ​
 my stack.yaml file: 
 packages: []
 extra-deps:
 - leancheck-1.0.0
 resolver: lts-21.24 
 My config.yaml file is fully standard.
 ​
 I have to get the imports to work on a global basis. So I should be able to cd into anny directory, start "stack ghci" and then be abl to use "import Tests.Leancheck". 
 Thanks for the help fellow IT wizards :)

That way my notes look visually appealing. But currently I have not found a way to do this in org-mode. Is this a futile cause and impossible?
 For example, I want to center the two images or place the two images side-by-side in the following note:
 https://preview.redd.it/9tyh172cel5c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=74582a8bd4f76c2f37f2ef30314bae0181bb41e2
 EDIT: Is this kind of feature not generally desired in the emacs community? I thought anyone who takes notes and organizes things in org-mode would have value in having this option. Or maybe it is too much of a headache?

 Hiya! Mainly been a lurker here (also just a lurker in general) during my emacs journey the past few months.
 Hurl is a cli tool for sending HTTP requests (using cURL under the hood) in plain text format similar to https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el but can be used outside emacs and also has some additional testing utilities built in. For more info see the hurl home page: https://hurl.dev/ 
 Hurl does have an emacs mode included but I wanted a few more features than what was already provided like graphql/json fontification, so I gave my own shot at trying to create a major mode as well as an exercise to learning more elisp.
 Thought I'd open up a new repo for this so I can incorporate any feedback from the community faster and then maybe see if I can incorporate this into the main hurl repo.
 Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've switched from vim to emacs recently with evil mode. It's been a great experience so far however, I'm facing an issue with js2-mode syntax highlighting. I appreciate that web-mode is designed for mixed syntax files, if you're say working with templates for front-end web-dev, however I have found it provides far superior syntax highlighting than js2-mode. I haven't noticed any other difference between js2-mode and web-mode apart from this, I guess I've only scratched the surface. I primarily work with js and json files for node.js back-end development and only touch front-end, where I guess web-mode would be excellent a minority of the time. The error highlighting seems to be same for both, driven by lsp-mode. I haven't touched ESlint yet (been using ts-ls so far), only just installed it.
 I guess my questions boil down to:
 Why should I use 1 over the other especially given the syntax highlighting preference?
 How does flycheck / flymake play into this, what are the differences?
 Is it fine to run 2 language servers for lsp-mode / how does that work? Using lsp-describe-session shows both of them running?
 As a side-note does anyone have a config with lsp-ui and peek that they're willing share for some inspiration / things I've missed.
 I also have tern running is this required?
 Thank you in advance.

 He goes on to add that some of his complaints are hyperbole and goes on to create his own fork of Emacs - for real?

 Come on guys, there is war in Palestine with thousands dying a more to come, some earthquakes occurring here and there, climate crises, chronic hunger, starvation and what nots in many parts of the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I just finished a computational physics class at university. They used Python. We had a browser based program that used a VM to store our files, and we edited everything on jupyter notebook. I basically had everything setup for me in the class at school. I didn't initialize or setup any of the programs.
 ​
 The class inspired me to try and code more here at home, I just got a book, Learning Physics with Functional Programming. They use Haskell as the language. I've got a macbook, and I have no idea how to set anything up. I barely understand what I'm doing. Believe me I've been watching tutorial after tutorial, but there's always some error I get that these tutorials don't address. I'm trying to become code literate.
 ​
 In that case I thought maybe I could get help here? I went to Haskell.org, and used the terminal command from there to install GHcup. Afterwards, I opened up VScode and downloaded the Haskell extension. Then, I tried to start a new project and begin working along the book I bought. 
 The problem is that anytime I set Haskell as my language for a new note in VScode, it gives the error that "Project requires GHcup but it isn't installed. Source: Haskell (extension)"
 ​
 I've tried going into my ~bash file to inspect the path of the GHcup file, but the terminal denies me access to it. I'm not even sure if that's what would help fix this either, but I saw a lot of reference to this on Haskell Troubleshooting forum links from VScode.
 ​
 Sorry for my incapability... this kinda makes me want to keep using my whiteboard for physics but I really want to be able to do bigger calculations on a computer, and not on Python.
 ​
 If I could get any help I'd appreciate it a lot

I've been really busy, and emacs have been nothing but trouble, debugging and configuration. It just stopped me from working efficiently. I finally understood what people mean by "Don't let your editor get in your way". It just stopped me from learning this new technology, and had me configuring and finding good packages that allow me to program with it in emacs, and occasionally debugging the previously installed packages like lsp, because either the autocompletion box doesn't show up, or lsp just spits some errors and shuts down.
 Then I used vscode, and wow! Everything just worked and I didn't need to config anything. But vscode is a pain too. It's not foss, and you have to use your mouse a lot.
 My rant is finished. Do you have any advice/roast for me?

 How exactly do I get a Haskell job? I’m in the US. No professional experience so I’m entry level.
 What backend web framework should I learn? Yesod or servant? Or snap? Or some other one?
 And what do I need to know?
 I’ve implemented a linear algebra library in Haskell with a servant api. But I want to invest some time into Haskell to get a job.

 When issues pertaining to multithreading inevitably came up in a talk, I made a low-brow passing comment about an "Emacs-STM" fork. It was meant to be tongue-in-cheek, but karma has it that this mind virus has now caught hold of my thoughts. Not the fork part of course, but definitely the STM part.
 If we take a longer view, say multi-decade ("the next 40 years"), do we expect the collaborative form we have now to be the ultimate resolution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know one way to do this, but hoping there's something simpler or more general. clangd (C++ LSP server) is over-aggressive about adding "helpful" #includes during completion. The way to turn that off is to pass -header-insertion=never on its cmd line.
 In eglot with recent trunk emacs, the C-related modes are configured by default like this, in eglot-server-programs:  ((c-mode c-ts-mode c++-mode c++-ts-mode) . ,(eglot-alternatives '("clangd" "ccls"))) 
 So I could splice that out and replace it, for sure. But then I lose the alternative of using ccls if that's what's installed, and it seems fragile with all the ts- stuff happening these days. So my question is, is there a way to configure eglot to say "when invoking clangd, always pass -header-insertion=never? And if not, would that be a useful addition? (Maybe a filter function to process the results of eglot--guess-contact?)

Judging by popularity, my most useful packages are:
  
devdocs.el: Documentation reader with quick and handy lookup commands. It is similar to the built-in Info reader, but has a different (likely larger) document coverage.
 code-cells: Utilities to work with “lightweight notebooks”, that is, source code which is split into cells by special %% comments. Also allows you to transparently edit Jupyter notebook (ipynb) files.
  
Combined with the above, these two packages can help setting up a nice Python editing environment (although there's nothing Python-specific about them):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/emacs. I've been using Emacs for a few years now but please, treat me as a total beginner!
 Magit is one of the most incredible tools available but it is frustratingly slow on big git repos, especially when they're located on a slow file system. I very often find myself giving 2-3 commands in a row and only seeing the output in a few seconds.
 E.g. I'd type (1) f u to fetch all, then (2) r e to trigger rebase elsewhere and then start typing (3) /mast so the counsel wrapper can find origin/master and then I press Enter. I basically do all steps (1)-(3) and will only see any output >5s later.
 This definitely breaks the workflow and I would at least expect Emacs not to freeze between inputs (1), (2) and (3) and just give me clues that there's a process running in background.
 Is it something possible or should I try to use some optimisation tricks to do less on every magit operation?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a followup post for https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/14dej62/please_help_collecting_statistics_to_optimize/
 Thanks everyone who submitted the data!
 I have now summarized everything. You can find the analysis in my EmacsConf2023 presentation - https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/gc/ and https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10213384 (reproducible analysis).
 The key takeaways from the above analysis:
 For users:
  
Emacs freezes due to GC are real
 … but not for all users
 When GC does get Emacs slower, it is either 
 slow startup ⇒ increase gc-cons-threshold to 20-80Mb check gc-elapsed after startup
 slow and frequent GC ⇒ increase gc-cons-percetage to 0.2-1.0 but watch Emacs RAM usage
 
  
For Emacs devs:
  
GC problem is very real for many users (9% of GCs are both frequent and slow)
 It is worth bumping gc-cons-threshold temporarily during startup
 Ideally, we should switch from Mark&Sweep to something more performant
 May increase gc-cons-percetage, but need to get user data for optimal numbers
  
Further plans:
  
With the collected data we can hopefully continue emacs-devel discussion on changing GC defaults and get somewhere. https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/20230310110747.4hytasakomvdyf7i@Ergus/
 
emacs-gc-stats package has now served its purpose, but I think that it might still be useful for people who want to toy around GC settings. I plan to add some kind of "session summary" command that will display the key statistics of current user session. It should help understanding the effects of GC customization on the performance.

I would like to introduce my first emacs package (and my first public code, please be gentle): emacs-goodnight
 This little minor mode will switch between two themes (usually dark and light) at sunset/sunrise or at user specified time. It will also switch you system theme.

 I wrote this package because I didn't know circadian.el existed.

Swimming with Ideas
This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Please be courageous and add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
I have been contemplating the concept of intelligence density and its implications. My focus has been on my own intellectual capacity and how to make improvements. I have noticed a significant lack of intellectual richness in what little media I'm exposed to.
A note requires a UUID, but the need to have it in the filename is unclear. Is this just forced on us because of a past nostalgic habit?
My productivity is negatively impacted by a decline in focus in the evening hours. I plan to implement a new routine scheduled for 8:00 PM to steer my performance consciously. We'll see if this approach is successful.
I'm done with Air Quality, Pollution & Smoke GEOL454, onto Young Adult Literature EDCI445 university class. I have a short winter break in which to focus on programming and woodworking.
Things I'm reading: all fiction for a change.
Difficult loves. Calvino, Italo. 1970. - Relationships
Heartburn. Ephron, Nora. 1983. - Food/relationship Fiction
The path to the spiders' nests. Calvino, Italo. 1947. - WW2 Youth Literature
Lessons in chemistry. Garmus, Bonnie. 2022. - Humor
Music I'm listening to:
Adele
Tone Ranger

 This what I mean by abbreviations the actual terminology may be different,eg.
 [[:alnum:]], [[:upper:]], [[:space:]], [[:xdigit:]] etc, to show some of the ones at regex101.com.
 Recreating the exact sequences I use for my own purposes can be difficult, so I would like to extend these kind of abbreviationss with some of my own sequences, ie give them a short name which is recompiled into the rx library.
 Does the rx library and any others have such features?
 UPDATE:
 I just noticed an rx-extra macro at Emacs Wiki: rx which has such a feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's create an Emacs Advent calendar! It would be nice if for every day till Christmas someone takes the opportunity to showcase their Emacs work. It will be interesting to see what you are all working on.
  
I swear it was December 7 when I started writing this post. :)
 By far my three most popular packages are:
  
orderless. A highly configurable completion style that matches multiple patterns in any order against minibuffer completion candidates.
 embark. The one I always struggle to explain, so instead go read u/karthink's wonderful blog post about it! Prodded by u/minad-emacs, I just released version 1.0! 🎉 
 marginalia. Informative annotations for minibuffer completion candidates, co-written with u/minad-emacs.
  
Packages I haven't put on MELPA or GNU ELPA, but I know some people use:
  
math-delimiters. Provides a nice command to insert LaTeX math delimiters and to toggle between inline and display versions of them.
 placeholder. On the fly ephemeral snippets: need to send a bunch of similar emails just this once so you don't want to bother making a skeleton, tempo or yasnippet template for them? Use placeholder!
 epithet. Give descriptive names to buffers.
  
Tiny, tiny packages in my personal configuration that I think someone may want to steal:
  
block-undo. Have keyboard macros undo in a single step (something vi gets right!).
 ffap-eshell. Make ffap correctly guess in more cases the directory containing a file name you find in an eshell buffer.
 shr-heading. Navigate between headings in an eww buffer (or more generally, shr buffer), also enables imenu.
 eval-region-advice. Advise evaluation commands to evaluate the region if active.
  
Finally, something useless which I've found fun (but haven't grown as much as I thought I would):
  
luggage. A Largely Undesired Gadget: a Generative Art Gallery for Emacs.
  
Previous advent calendar days: day 6, day 5, day 4, day 3, day 2, day 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For work, I sometimes need to forward emails I receive in HTML format, and I need the forwarded email to include the original HTML format. Do folks have a way to do this in mu4e they could share? 
 I can, using org-mime, compose HTML emails if I need to. I also can view HTML emails using xwidgets. And I can attach the HTML email to an outgoing message using mu4e-action-capture-message and mu4e-compose-attach-captured-message. But is there a way to make the HTML content of the original email so that it's rendered inline as it were? (Sorry, I'm not sure I got the terminology right here...)
 I tried looking at the raw message I capture with mu4e-action-capture-message, thinking I might be able to (a) open that file, (b) find the HTML content I need, and (c) insert it as an html part. But I didn't have much luck. (For one thing, the HTML bit of the raw email doesn't render the same as the original one somehow.) 
 I'm close to a sort of working solution, by just replacing disposition=attachment with disposition=inline in the output of calling mu4e-compose-attach-captured-message. But I feel like I don't quite understand what I'm doing and would appreciate any pointers or suggestions.
 (I've searched around and found a few discussions of issues related to this, but nothing there seemed to help with my particular issue---there's an issue at the mu repo which prompted me to use the capture+attach workflow I mentioned above, but that's the closest I've got to an answer so far...)

The Scala Days talk on YouTube.
 A Hello World project made by Alvin Alexander.
 A mill-scala-hello Gitter template.
 The ScalaCon talk on YouTube.
  
I had filed a GitHub ticket, but it was closed as "out of scope". I'm not sure why the maintainers insisted on perpetuating the ambiguity, and would like to know your opinion about the following. None of the references above answer these very basic and very important questions.
  
A recommended single-module project structure including unit tests and a non-default package (i.e. files not directly under src). The assumption is that a multi-module project is simply a collection of several single-module (potentially interdependent) projects.
 Separation of Java and Scala source code in a mixed project.
 Separation of unit and integration tests in a multi-module project.
 Separation of main and test resources.

 Built-in and external JS-related modes
 JS-related modes built into Emacs core:
  
js-mode
 js-jsx-mode
 js-ts-mode
 typescript-ts-mode
 tsx-ts-mode
  
External modes that replace and/or build on core modes:
  
js2-mode: https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode
 rjsx-mode: https://github.com/felipeochoa/rjsx-mode
 js3-mode: https://github.com/tamzinblake/js3-mode
 web-mode: https://web-mode.org/
 jtsx: https://github.com/llemaitre19/jtsx
 tsx-mode: https://github.com/orzechowskid/tsx-mode.el
 ultimate-js-mode: https://github.com/guillaumebrunerie/ultimate-js-mode
  
An external minor mode: https://codeberg.org/ckruse/tsx-ts-helper-mode
 Request to Contribute to Emacs Core
 Instead of splitting our efforts, let's bundle our resources and make Emacs core better. I appeal to all external JS-related package maintainers to contribute parts of their packages to Emacs core. Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Install GnuGP version 2.4.1. or higher.
 
From the command line, symmetrically encrypt a test file.
 $ echo 'test' > test.txt $ gpg --symmetric test.txt
 
Open the file encrypted file, test.txt.gpg in Emacs version 29 or higher. You should be prompted for the passphrase you used to encrypt the file in the previous step.
 
Edit the file.
 
M-x toggle-debug-on-quit
 
Save the file. Emacs will hang. C-g to quit. You will see a backtrace which indicates Emacs was stuck in a loop inside epg-wait-for-status.
 
Execute the following well-intentioned advice found scattered throughout unofficial Emacs support channels:
 (fset 'epg-wait-for-status 'ignore)
 
Save the file again! Horay! It saved!
 
You now have a corrupt symmetrically encrypted file! Try decrypting it!
 $ gpg --decrypt test.txt.gpg
 
Now you don't ever have to worry about the file again! Remember to do this to your backups if you'd like to corrupt those as well.
 
 The real solution is to downgrade GnuPG. DO NOT USE (fset 'epg-wait-for-status 'ignore)! It's the equivalent of blowing through a stop sign and hoping your car doesn't get hit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am converting some c code to haskell and am using ST (I do not wish to use foreign imports). Currently, I find it very annoying to use readSTRef, writeSTRef, modifySTRef, and all the monad functions. It would be nice to have a "lifted" function that could accept values of 'ST s a', 'STRef s a', and 'a' and return the result 'ST s b'.
 Is there a package that already accomplishes this? If not, it would be nice to have a helper lift function that allows something like
 lift :: (a -> b) -> m -> ST s b lift' :: (a -> b -> c) -> m -> n -> ST s c -- example lifted functions not' = lift not (^>^) = lift' (>) 
 I have tried couple of implementations for lift but have not been successful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although I have been studying functional programming in Haskell (and Agda) as part of my university course for over a year now, and we’ve covered the basics and more advanced topics like monads, states, writing interpreters etc., I’d like to start from scratch to revise and strengthen my knowledge, thus I composed a list of books to do so.
 Stage 1: Basics - Programming in Haskell
 Stage 2: Advanced topics - Real World Haskell - Haskell in Depth
 Stage 3: Specialised topics - Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell - Functional Design and Architecture (early-access)
 To those who have read some (or perhaps all) of these books, would you recommend them in this order? Individual book opinions are welcomed too, or if you think I should take a look at another, non-mentioned book, feel free to share!
 Thank you in advance!
 PS: I am familiar with the book ‘Haskell Programming from First Principle’, which AFAIK covers not just the basics, but advanced topics as well. My only issue with it, and consequently the reason why it is not on the list, is that it has no physical edition available anymore, and I’d like to stick with those books that have one. About ‘Learn You a Haskell for Good!’; it had some rather poor reviews on the sub so I ditched it. ‘Programming in Haskell’ seems more professional and serious anyways. But if you’ve read both of them, do tell your experience.

 I just changed theme to modus-operandi-tinted, and I really like it. One thing I would like to change is to make the background color of the line numbers face the same color as the background color of the buffer. I tried looking in the documentation (https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes), but I can only find how to change the styling of the line numbers (6.2.21. Make line numbers use alternative styles).
 Any help is appreciated!

 I'm using vscode with haskell plugin and it's driving me mad.
 It seems to be working every now and then, or with some features seemingly broken, or it's behavior doesn't reflect the latest change.
 Also in the extension output it generates a lot of errors, and I have no ideas if that's normal.
 I don't even know it is supposed to work. How can I know that whether it's really working properly, all the time, with every feature working?
 For example, how can I jump to functions defined in src/Lib.sh from reference in App/Main.hs? In other languages I just use ctrl+] (I'm using vim plugin).
 And suppose I want to use Data.ByteString.Base64.encode, is there supposed to be a shortcut to import it, instead of manually typing the statement?

Computed Properties for Haskell Records by Rodrigo Mequita
In my opinion, this could be handy as some functions can really be better thought of as properties of a datatype, and doing so doesn’t preclude you from also using it as a function in cases where it reads more naturally (and of course, pass it on to higher order functions).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks in advance for the help!
 I have a couple very long org files that are essentially dumping grounds for notes for large projects. I'd like to refactor them into smaller files in subfolders. One, for example, is for a book project, and there are characters, scenes, background notes, etc., and it would be much nicer to break it up into many files. However, when doing this, I want to be able to quickly find all the files relevant to a specific topic, even if they aren't currently open.
 I don't see a way that searching by tags or similar looks for files that are not currently open in a buffer.
 I've been using org-roam more and more these days, mostly because finding notes in it is easier. One solution might be to simply convert 100% of my org files over to org-roam and essentially use org-roam as a search / file open tool.
 But is there a way in more "pure" org-mode to quickly search through a whole mess of files and bring up only the ones with specific tags?

 I am trying to be able to edit or view org files in the Google drive mobile app. 
 My set up is a folder synced with rclone to Google drive. But the problem is that the mime type of org files is inode and not txt. So I think if I tell rclone to sync and set the .org files mine type to txt, that can work.
 If you have any better solution or the method on changing the mime type of org files to txt, I am all ears. Looks like Google drive is horrible in Linux. 
 All in all, thank you for your time!

 The program is supposed to sort money (example $12.34) into a user-selected amount of denominations ($10, $5, ..., $0.01). For example, $12.34 with $1 denominations selected should sort the amount into $1(12), $0.25(1), $0.05(1), $0.01(4).
 The program is supposed to receive an input as a Float then return an [Int] containing the amounts of each denomination counted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Haskellers,
 I've been struggling with some really weird behavior for the last few hours now and I can't seem to figure it out, maybe that someone here can help? I've narrow the actual problem down to 2 very stripped down scenarios, 1 that works, and 1 that doesn't. Both are being run in exactly the same simple IO function that just grabs a lazy bytestring that is being generated from an evdev file and feeds it to the function and tries to print the result.
 works :: L.ByteString -> [ByteString] works = L.foldrChunks chomp [] where chomp b acc = b : acc doesnot :: L.ByteString -> [ByteString] doesnot = fst . L.foldrChunks chomp ([], []) where chomp b (acc, bcc) = (b : acc, b : bcc) test :: IO () test = do withEvdev "/dev/input/by-id/usb-Technomancy_Atreus-event-kbd" $ \byts -> do mapM_ print $ works byts -- mapM_ print $ doesnot byts 
 The first function works as expected, it returns a lazy list of strict bytestrings that accumulate as keyboard events are generated. And the testing function prints out data as it comes in. The second function simply will not ever run. I've covered it with trace statements and changed the accumulator to undefineds and the pattern matches to underscores. Doesn't change anything. Somehow changing the accumulator to a tuple seems to turn the whole handling of the loop strict?

 addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-native-packager" % "1.9.16")
 ...and then add some configuration to build.sbt
 I'm failing at the first step. I get this error when trying to sbt reload:
 [error] (update) sbt.librarymanagement.ResolveException: Error downloading com.typesafe.sbt:sbt-native-packager;sbtVersion=1.0;scalaVersion=2.12:1.9.16
 I'm actually using Scala 3.3.1 , so why is it picking up the packager for a much older version of the language? And this seems pretty suss... the MVN Central page for SBT Native Packager:
 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.sbt/sbt-native-packager_2.12_1.0
 Seems to have a version that might also correspond to an old version of Scala. What am I misunderstanding here? Can I not use Scala 3 with this packaging tool?

 ​
 I use Gnus for pretty simple stuff for centralising 5 mails and, 2 more to come, I know that Gmail and outlook work without issue, and I've fixed some notifications issue in MacOS, since growlnotify is not working in my latest MacOS version.
 ​
 For the two more two go, I will be implementing in one of them Outlook, in which I wonder if you guys have any configuration I can take a look at, since I haven't done anything regarding outlook and posts about it seem to be pretty old. Perhaps it may just be the simple 'get an application password' like Email.
 ​
 Aside from that, I have pretty simple mail sending capabilities and no contacts support, so I only use it to reply and, have posting styles so I always reply to the email I got the email from.
 ​
 Another thing I would also love to fix is that, I'm using gnus-demon-add-handler 'gnus-demon-scan-news to scan for mail every x minutes, which blocks Emacs since, I have gnus open all the time, but knowing that some emails I could get are critical I do need it all the day, aside that I would be working and, having some mini blocks is annoying.
 ​
 Thank you, I would love to hear if anyone uses Gnus extensively!.

 TLDR. Gnus Configurations and improvements

When I initially connect to a server over tramp, then attempt to open up a local file the host and username are always prepended to the file path and I can't delete them. For example the file path will look like
 Find-file: /ssh:host: path/to/file
 and the furthest I can go back is
 Find-file:/ssh:host:
 I've attempted to type in ~ and // as suggested in another reddit post, however, this just takes me back to the home directory on the remote.
 Is there any way to remove the host info from the beginning of the file path?
 ​
 Edit: The issue seems to be with ivy and the way it alters the "completing-read-function" as mentioned here https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/45929/disable-ivy-for-find-file , this is enough of a reason for me to try vertico instead.

 I have forked and cloned GHC onto my machine. I was able, after correcting a few problems, build GHC using ./boot && ./configure and hadrian/build -j as instructed in the README.
 But when I try to run the tests (hadrian/build test), the compiler is failing. It is failing despite the fact that I have not made any changes to it whatsoever. I have attached the build-summary results.
 SUMMARY for test run started at Tue Dec 5 18:26:56 2023 1:31:28.360659 spent to go through 9836 total tests, which gave rise to 48054 test cases, of which 38037 were skipped 0 had missing libraries 9880 expected passes 106 expected failures 0 caused framework failures 0 caused framework warnings 0 unexpected passes 2 unexpected failures 0 unexpected stat failures 29 fragile tests Unexpected failures: /tmp/ghctest-i15kidsy/test spaces/libraries/ghc-compact/tests/T16992.run T16992 [bad exit code (137)] (compacting_gc) /tmp/ghctest-i15kidsy/test spaces/libraries/ghc-compact/tests/T16992.run T16992 [bad exit code (137)] (normal) Appending 242 stats to file: build_results.txt user error (tests failed) Build failed. 
 Quite frankly I am a bit stumped. First, on why so many test cases were skipped. Second, I have absolutely no idea what could be causing this error or how to fix it. Have any of you had trouble getting GHC running and have encountered something similar? I am using ghc-9.4.7. 
 Some additional information from running the failing tests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Reddit,
 I'm encountering an issue with my Haskell project where modules placed in subdirectories aren't being recognized during the build process. Here's a glimpse of my project's structure:
 src/ ├── Lib.hs ├── Lib2.hs ├── Lib3.hs ├── source │ └── SourceLib5.hs 
 The specific problem arises with SourceLib5.hs located in the source subdirectory. When I attempt to build the project using the following command:
 rm hask-tracer2.cabal && stack clean && stack build --test 
 I receive an error indicating that SourceLib5 cannot be found:
 [Error Output] /home/dewi/code/hask_tacer/hask-tracer2/test/Dewi5Spec.hs:11:1: error: Could not find module ‘SourceLib5’ Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. 
 This error occurs despite the attempt to import SourceLib5 in Dewi5Spec.hs
 import SourceLib5 (getMiddle) 
 Further investigation revealed that SourceLib5 is not listed in the generated hask-tracer2.cabal file:
 exposed-modules: Lib Lib2 Lib3 other-modules: 
 Could anyone help me understand why the module in the subdirectory is not being included in the build and how to resolve this issue? For reference, you can find the project on GitHub: hask-tracer2 (sub-dir-test branch).
 Thank you in advance for your insights!

I have the issue when in editing mode at the end of a line if autocorrect disagrees with the word and I press enter to go to the next line then it selects the first autocorrect suggestion. Not ideal, anyone have a quick solution? Im also a noob so it may be as simple as making me aware of a different keybinding to add another line while in editing mode.

 I am storing some information about Emacs files in a database and when the a file name is selected in the application, I want an specific Emacs instance to open the file in a chosen frame and window. 
 The Emacs instance could communicate with the app about its state and the app would send the commands to windows.
 The application could be a native application or a web page.
 Are there some functions which can get a file to open in a particular window and a particular frame on some specific instance of Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I get the feeling that learning Elisp as your first Lisp doesn't help with learning Lisp or is even helpful with Emacs itself because the focus of Emacs is too narrow, as though fixating on use-package and other editor configuration code isn't bad enough.
 e.g. when it comes to UIs text prompt and some other wierd font-locking stuff is the usual way, whereas with other Lisps you would be working on a wide variety of GUI and TUI interfaces and other libraries.
 Do those with an experience of other Lisps in feel this way, although learning Lisp may have involved learning Emacs as well because it is the go to Lisp development environment?
 I have seen a number of general Lisp tutorials I want t try, eg https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/w37hyj/video_kavehs_common_lisp_lesson_01/

For which Applicative do the expressions pure x <* pure y and pure x <|> pure y produce different results?
  
a. Maybe
 b. []
 c. Validation
 b is the correct answer but I don't understand why. Validation is a type that's defined in the course, but we can ignore it for this question, and consider options a and b only.

 Let's say I start hyperdrive gateway on one machine from within Emacs; if I'm using another machine to connect to that specific hyperdrive, I can only do it read-only (the file is opened in a read-only buffer). Can I have full access to the shared files, from all the machines connected to it? Can I designate, in some way, which clients can have full control?
 Another question would be if it's possible to start a hyperdrive gateway on a Linux system, with no Emacs installed on it, and use Emacs-es on various other machines to connect to that node, also having full control over the files, for all (hand-picked) clients?

 Recently I wanted to get back to Emacs, and as with any text editor I use, installed the Gruvbox theme.
 The problem is that even though the colors are the same, different types of keywords are colored differently which bothers me deeply. Is there an easy way to configure it to the way I'm more used to? Aside from the rainbow brackets which are fine and unconnected to my knowledge.
 Also tried doom-gruvbox bundled with Doom Emacs, and it looked even worse.

 How can I install my own TTF fonts so that Emacs will use them? I've tried putting them in a .fonts directory inside the Emacs home directory, and I've tried putting them where Termux wants them, but Emacs doesn't end up finding the fonts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using org-roam to keep my notes, which generally works well for me. There's one thing I am missing and I'm wondering if I just overlooked it, or whether it simply doesn't exist.
 I regularly paste text from other sources (e.g. a bit of Wikipedia text for a stub note, or highlighted text from a PDF via org-noter) into my notes and what I am looking for is a way to find/indicate existing org-roam entries in those pieces of text.
 For example, if I have existing org-roam entries for genetic variants and LD, then if I copy a piece of text like
  
Genetic variants that are in LD need to be pruned
  
into a new node, I would like to have some way to highlight/find/link these two potential org-roam links. This doesn't need to happen automagically. Manually calling a function that parses the new node would also be fine.
 So this is basically some sort of "unlinked references", but the other way around. When I manually type text into my nodes, completion does its work, but for pasted text, that is (understandably) not the case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought a new compact "75%" "gaming" keyboard and it turns out it is a US layout keyboard, if that is what it really is. It has lights on all the keys and it doesn't even have Caps Lock and Num Lock indicators as all the keys are lit. If there is a way to indicate the status of the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys I'm yet to discover it.
 There are other similar types whose light patterns programmable, but on this one they appear to be permamently lit.
 It seems that the keyboard vendors charge a hefty premium for a "gaming" keyboard with a UK layout, and my view is that if I have to reprogram the keyboard whether UK or US then I might as well stick to the cheaper US one and reprogram it.
 I got this one for all of £7.99 in baby pink because I could use the color therapy and I love the tactile feedback. I'm not sure how it will last though because one of the keys came off easily.
 UK keyboards have a smaller Left-Shift key with the key for \ and | next to it, before the Z, and on this keyboard \ is activated by Alt-Shift - and | is activated by Alt-, below theESC` key.
 I want to use Alt-= for the | key to keep it closer. Currently pressing Alt-= produces nothing until it is pressed again after which it produces ¸, some kind of tiny right-angled character.
 I have read a few guides which are general and are targetted for Linux from bottom up, but I'd prefer something Emacsy if there is one, and if EXWM requires additional consideration.
 PS. I got another even smaller one in baby blue with 61 keys which I also need to program, but that may have to wait, and boy I never had a glimmer of what Emacs pinky could feel like until I tried to use the basic navigation keys which require the Function and Alt keys to activate them.

 I have used Emacs for years at this point but in a relatively unsophisticated way. I use it basically the same way I would use VSCode or any other editor. I am looking for tutorials on Emacs that will help a user who already knows their way around Emacs to get the most of it, that discusses features which might be overwhelming for a beginner while skipping over basic stuff like navigating around the buffer.
 People always say "Emacs is infinitely customizable!" This is only helpful if you come to Emacs thinking "*My* editor can do X, Y and Z/my editor can't do X, Y and Z, but I want it to. Can Emacs do X, Y and Z?" Then, you can say "Yes, you can write X, Y and Z in elisp." This is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for ideas on ways to improve my workflow using Emacs that I wouldn't have thought of myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I was having an issue with loading packages with the elpaca package manager that depend on vterm (vterm-toggle & multi-vterm). Loading my configuration from scratch, all the packages get downloaded, however, vterm-toggle and multi-vterm seem to require vterm-module and require it to be compiled. I have to answer yes or no to compile the module, however, from the elpaca-log menu I can't figure out how to give that answer. 
 I know that there is variable "vterm-always-compile-module" that should skip this question, however, it doesn't seem to be working for me. I have tried placing that in multiple different sections of the use-package block, however, confirmation always seems to be required. 
 (use-package vterm :ensure t :commands vterm :custom (vterm-shell "/bin/zsh") :config (main/leader-keys "o T" '(vterm :wk "Vterm"))) (use-package multi-vterm :init (setq vterm-always-compile-module t) :requires vterm ) 
 Here is the relevant part of my config. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Either a way to bypass the compilation question altogether or a way to answer yes on the elpaca-log menu. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been experimenting with using GNUS for email. I have several emails configured thus far and seem to have only one strange issue. For example, here is an obfuscated portion of the config:
  (use-package gnus :ensure nil :custom (gnus-select-method '(nnnil nil)) (gnus-summary-exit-hook 'gnus-summary-expire-articles) (gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnimap "mymail" (nnimap-address "mail.mymail.com") (nnimap-server-port "imaps") (nnimap-stream ssl) (nnir-search-engine imap) (nnmail-expiry-target "nnimap+mymail:Trash") (nnmail-expiry-wait immediate))) 
 In particular I want messages to expire immediately and be moved into my Trash folder. When I am inside a group summary, I can manually mark messages as Expired with E. Then I could manually expire them with B e or M-x gnus-summary-expire-articles. When I exit the summary buffer the messages appear in the Trash folder as expected. However I also have the gnus-summary-exit-hook set to call the same function. This configuration is actually unnecessary since that is the default setting. When I just exit the summary buffer, I see Expiring articles...done . . . but they aren't moved to the Trash folder. 
 I am pretty confused by this behavior as I see no difference between the two invocations of gnus-summary-expire-articles. My config is also almost a mirror of most recent GNUS guides/configurations so I feel like I must be missing something simple or everyone else would experience the same behavior.
 Has anyone else had this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs Community!,
 ​
 I'm trying to configure Emacs as an Email client, currently using IMAPS correctly. Issue being that, when I'm trying to send mail with the configured mail, I get asked the SMTP server, even though I have configured it through smtpmail-multi.el.
 I'm using Emacs Doom with Emacs 29.1. And Gnus IMAPS is using the auth-sources configured (maos-keychain-generic) correctly. Reading the smtp Emacs documentation, it apparently can use .authinfo?, which I'm not using but, another way in auth-sources that works when fetching but someone not when sending. This authentication also works when using IRC circe.
 ​
 Here's my configuration:
 (add-to-list 'smtpmail-multi-accounts '(gmail . ("mymail@yes.com" "smtp.gmail.com" 587 "mymail@yes.com" starttls nil nil nil))) (add-to-list 'smtpmail-multi-accounts '(gmail . ("mysecondmail@no.com" "smtp.gmail.com" 587 "mysecondmail@no.com" starttls nil nil nil))) (add-to-list 'smtpmail-multi-associations '("mymail@yes.com" gmail)) (add-to-list 'smtpmail-multi-associations '("mysecondmail@no.com" gmail)) (setq smtpmail-servers-requiring-authorization "\\.com") ;; More Sending configurations (require 'org-mime) (setq org-mime-library 'mml) (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'org-mime-confirm-when-no-multipart) (setq gnus-dribble-ignore t) 
 Also, these mails have each a lot of contacts that I would need for auto complete, or at least get my mails autocompleted. How do you manage contacts?.
 ​
 TLDR. Updated way to use the integrated SMTP send with different mails.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi, I have created a virtual dired buffer grouping several directories containing .org and .md notes.
 I would like to start a deadgrep search within these subfolders... but deadgrep needs a base folder...not a list of folders.
 I am under Windows10, so fzf in emacs does not work (it does under the CMD... but I want to stay in emacs).
 can you point me please to some direction on how to do this? thanks

Laminar says "Easy to understand: no macros", while Kyo emphasizes "Note: defer is currently the only macro in Kyo. All other features use regular language constructs." It seems that using less macros is something library users will like.
 While I understand that macros were a problem in the past (Scala 2), and that using them, even in their present form is not for the faint-hearted. My understanding is that, for the user, that should not be a problem (if the macros/libraries are well written). The black magic that macros can introduce, should make the user's life easier. Do you avoid libraries that use macros? Why?

 So far I've only succeeded by doing the following: - Move my custom elisp to a new file (emacs-lib.el) which starts with (provide 'emacs-lib) - Manually run emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load while visiting that file - Change my init file to load the library:
 (setq elisp-dir "~/config/elisp") (add-to-list 'load-path elisp-dir) (require 'emacs-lib) 
 After restarting Emacs, I've checked that many of my custom functions are indeed native-compiled.
 It would be nice if I could have my init file take care of compiling the library when missing or outdated. Even better if I didn't need the separate file, but that's no big deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an org mode document that consists pretty much entirely of top level headlines with properties.
 So far, I have written a couple functions to grab individual properties and grab all properties, then a wrapper that uses completing-read to let me pick a headline and return all properties. Currently, that wrapper only lets me search by headline, because I'm using completing-read to grab the headline then feeding that headline into my "get-all-properties" function. 
 I've been trying (and failing) to find a way to search by property as well as headline - i.e. If I have headline 'A', 'B', and 'C' with property ':GROUP:' equal to 'test' , and 'D', 'E', and 'F' with ':GROUP:' equal to 'answer', I want to show the list of headlines as usual (A,B,C,D,E,F) but type 'test' into the minibuffer, and narrow the options down to just A B and C. 
 The closest option to this that I found was the 'alt-completing-read' function (defined more here) but that only seems to let you search by the first element in the alist, not the second.
 If anyone knows of a way to achieve this, I'd appreciate any advice, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a cabal project all the modules must be explicitly listed for building in the .cabal. This would usually result in a very long list of modules. Is there a way/work in progress for regex support to efficiently list them? Like say Utils.* which would recursively include all modules?
 If no or if this might be an anti pattern for some reason, how do very large projects manage this efficiently? Do they copy paste the path by hand for literally every single module?
 I have also seen some projects on github like ShellCheck which first make a library, expose all the modules and then simple add that do build-depends of the final executable. Is this the recommended approach than having just one executable and adding all the modules to other-modules:?

 alphapapa, tarsius, and I just released v0.3.0 of hyperdrive.el!
 Prot and I are presenting the new features at EmacsConf tomorrow!
 Highlights of v0.3.0:
  
Added a new interface to hyperdrive-mirror which uses new features from Transient v0.5.0
 Redesigned the *hyperdrive-mirror* buffer to use taxy-magit-section
 Added support for starting and stopping hyper-gateway from within Emacs on machines without systemd
 Add customization options for displaying hyperdrives using format-spec
  
Some more goodies:
  
Basic Embark integration
 find-file-at-point integration
 Support following relative links in hyperdrive markdown files
 Internally, hyperdrive.el now uses shorthands.el
  
For the full set of changes, please check out the hyperdrive.el CHANGELOG.
 By the time the talk airs, v0.3.0 should be available on NonGNU ELPA and MELPA!
 I'm excited to see what other projects folks are working on this Emacs Advent!
 Join us for the second day of EmacsConf!!!

 I am an American living with my family in Slovakia. I conduct my work and professional life in English, but find that I often need to intersperse Slovak words into my text. I have issues with the many current methods for entering diacritics and accented characters:
  
Because I spend most of my time using English, I don't want to switch input methods back and forth from Slovak just for single words.
 I find the C-x 8 maps for entering individual diacritics and accent marks a bit too cumbersome. To use it, one must think about which accent mark you want before you type the character, an…]]></summary>

 as a long-time vim (and emacs noobie) user I am using emacs for orgmode and have "(sqet evil-want-minibuffer t)" in my init.el.
 The problem is now that this seems to interfere with orgmode because in the date-picker that you get when inserting a time-stamp S-<left> is now bound to evil-backward-word-begin and not to the function that moves the date one day back (the same happens for S-<right>. S-<up> and S-<down> work as expected).
 Is there a way to have evil-mode in the minibuffer yet use the usual orgmode keybindings in the date picker?
 Many thanks!

I managed to solve it with the help of State Monad, although I don't feel myself very proud of my solution. I think it's quite convoluted and probably not too haskellish (I don't know if this term exists, but I come from Python and in this community they use the term Pythonic a lot). I have still a long way until writing idiomatic code, so please, if you have suggestions to improve it let me know. 
 Thanks in advance!!

 Im currently in my first Semester of studying Computer Science and i have to install haskell since we're currently learning that. I only have a windows laptop and have already tried using the Linux subsystem, but this never works. The University hasnt given us any tutorial on how to do it and every youtube video does it very differently, so im really unsure on what i have to do.
 So is there any good tutorial/better way of getting haskell onto my Windows Laptop?
 Any help is appreciated! (Also sorry if my english is weird, its my 3rd language)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's create an Emacs Advent calendar! It would be nice if for every day till Christmas someone takes the opportunity to showcase their Emacs work. It will be interesting to see what you are all working on.
 I'll make a start - at the first of December I finally released stable versions of multiple of my packages. The Consult package provides search commands with live preview. Some of the commands run asynchronously. Consult reached version 1.0, a little more than three years after the first release 0.1 and with 2211 commits in the repository. These are the stable versions I have tagged today:
  
Consult 1.0: Search commands with live preview
 Corfu 1.0: Completion popup for code and text
 Cape 1.0: Completion backends for in-buffer completion
 Tempel 1.0: Template expansion
 Jinx 1.0: Spell checker based on Enchant
 OSM 1.0: OpenStreetMap viewer
 Org-Modern 1.1: Org styling
  
Furthermore I have released new versions of Vertico and Marginalia:
  
Vertico 1.5: Minibuffer Completion UI
 Marginalia 1.4: Minibuffer annotations, co-authored with Omar Antolín Camarena
  
All the packages are available from GNU ELPA and MELPA. I'll refer you to the changelogs for the details regarding the releases. I am happy to hear your feedback. Thanks!

 I imagine my kids sifting through my stuff 50 years from now. If it's all in Emacs, they won't be able to sift through ANYTHING, because it's not intuitive, not navigable. You can't click on anything. They would have to learn a few dozen key commands to do ANYTHING. I get that they're just text files, but I don't think my family would know that. Evernote, on the other hand, while proprietary, is stupid simple to navigate. (FWIW I tend to use one big file with all my notes as org-headings. Maybe individual files would be more non-emacs-user friendly?)
 I know it's weird and morbid, but I think about these things. Anyone else? I guess I'm thinking about long-term archival in a digital system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graal Native Image is a technology to compile Java code ahead-of-time to a lightweight native binary executable, which has the advantages of smaller resources, starts in milliseconds, no warmup needed, and reduce attack surface. The serialization in graalvm is tricky and slow since it doesn't support reflection, jit, and bytecode manipulation. Many performance optimization can't be applied in graalvm.
 In Fury 0.4.0 version, Fury can run on GraalVM native image efficiently and is super easy-to-use. Neither reflection nor meta config are needed. Fury generates all code for Fury JIT framework and MethodHandle/LambdaMetafactory at graalvm native image build time. Then use those generated code for serialization at runtime without any extra cost, the performance is great.
 Compared to native JDK serialization, Fury can be 46x faster than JDK, and less than half of the serialized size.
 See https://github.com/alipay/fury/blob/main/docs/guide/graalvm_guide.md for example and benchmarks.
 This is a big step for jvm serialization, please give it a try and share us with your feedbacks.

 Why should I learn Scala? What are the pros and cons?
 I've heard that Scala is a powerful and versatile language, but I'm curious about the real-world experiences of those who have used it. What advantages does Scala bring to the table, and are there any drawbacks that one should be aware of?
 Here are a few questions to get the discussion going:
 Pros:
  
What specific features of Scala do you find most beneficial in comparison to other languages, especially Java?
 Have you found Scala to be particularly well-suited for certain types of projects or domains?
 How has Scala's support for functional programming influenced your coding style and project architecture?
  
Cons:
  
Are there challenges or pitfalls you've encountered while working with Scala that newcomers should be aware of?
 How does Scala's learning curve compare to other languages, and what resources would you recommend for someone starting out?
 Are there any specific scenarios or types of projects where Scala might not be the best fit?
  
Feel free to share your experiences, tips, or any resources you think would be helpful for someone considering learning Scala. I'm excited to hear your perspectives! 🚀

 i am starting out with orgmode and would like to be able to see (and ideally sync 2-way) todos and appointments to my android device.
 So far I have looked into syncing calendar entries and have come up with this:
 Etar as calendar app, ICSx⁵ for syncing it with caldav, radicale as caldav server and org-caldav to sync orgmode.
 This setup works but looks ridiculously complex for such a simple use-case and so I wonder if this is really the way to do it.
 So my question is:
 What is your solution to the problem of getting your orgmode-stuff onto your phone? What apps do you use and how do you sync?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/haskell, we are a research team at Monash University, interested in interactive tools for functional programming. For one of our projects, we created a Haskell puzzle game called Zero to Hero. 
 Here, we invite you to explore 10 unique puzzles; each challenges you to implement a seemingly impossible function. The only help you have is a handful of strange-looking helper functions and your own wits. The game starts easy but quickly elevates into total madness. 
 You can choose to participate in the study or play for fun without any data collection at all. No stress. More details are explained on the landing page. 
 I hope you enjoy the game! I will answer any question in this thread.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a setup that sort of gives what I'm looking for, but Emacs complains that I'm not doing it right.
 I have a large number of org-mode appointments that depend on the date of Easter. They are currently in the form of diary sexp, but I don't really care what form they're in; what I'm really trying to find is a general solution to "When today is X days before Easter, show arbitrary message 'X' in the org agenda. When today is Y days after Easter, show arbitrary message 'Y' in the org agenda." (In all of my cases, Easter means "the Easter within the current calendar year".)
 Emacs elegantly figures out the correct date for Easter, but Emacs also has a hard-coded list of Christian holidays that aren't useful to me. Instead of a new hard-coded list of holidays, I'm looking to make arbitrary and changeable use of the Easter calculation - compared to today - without showing any holidays at all.

 My solution for today:
 ``` calculateSumOfAllCalibrationValues :: String -> Int calculateSumOfAllCalibrationValues x = sum . map parseCalibrationInput $ lines x
 parseCalibrationInput :: String -> Int parseCalibrationInput = read . (\x -> [head x, last x]) . filter isNumber
 calculateSumOfAllCalibrationValues' :: String -> Int calculateSumOfAllCalibrationValues' x = sum . fmap (parseCalibrationInput . parseSpelledOutDigits) $ lines x
 parseSpelledOutDigits :: String -> String parseSpelledOutDigits x = foldr ((x, y) acc -> replace x y acc) x [ ("one", "1"), ("two", "2"), ("three", "3"), ("four", "4"), ("five", "5"), ("six", "6"), ("seven", "7"), ("eight", "8"), ("nine", "9") ]
 replace :: String -> String -> String -> String replace original new whole@(x : y : xs) = if original isPrefixOf whole then replace original new (x : new <> xs) else x : replace original new (y : xs)
 replace _ _ [x] = [x] replace _ _ [] = []

 I've been using neovim for awhile but have been increasingly frustrated with not being able to understand how things work when they break down. Hoping to learn emacs for fun and maybe to even replace/improve my nvim workflows.
 Things went well at first. I followed the tutorial and got used to some basic navigation as well as window and buffer navigation. I LOVE being able to `C-h` for functions, keys, and variables.
 I decided it was time to start trying to configure things and installing packages. I'm not patient enough to watch 10 hours of system crafters videos and didn't really want to buy Mastering Emacs, so I decided to do some googling…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I am a Neovim and Obsidian user and plan to move for my notes, and then for coding, to Emacs and org mode. I started to learn vanilla Emacs (and Elisp) week ago, and write simple notes in Emacs, the majority of my note taking is still done in Obsidian however. One feature I miss is a sidebar outlining the contents of the current file. I tend to have very big files and the sidebar makes it easy to navigate it.
 ![Like this sidebar on the right](https://i.imgur.com/uUSh5XR.png). I didn't find the solution for this yet. I don't aim to replicate my Obsidian setup fully, but I wonder if there is a plugin to this. Or maybe another alternative to navigating big org files.

 My goal: 
 Use Orgmode to customise my emacs and init files while using the Dropbox directory. I would also like to use a custom named init file so it's like eckoinit.el instead of init.el (For easier recognition and modification).
 Overall, I'd like to sync and use emacs from different computers using the same configs.
 I know one of my current snags is I can't remember how to tell emacs from Orgmode to use a differently named init file. I feel like this should be an obvious answer that I should have found by now and I feel silly. 
 Thanks for your time!

Is there a VSCode addon that would just perform a predefined Haskell GHC compilation task (like Microsoft's C/C++ addon does). I don't need any other properties. So far I've just been manually compiling (command line) but it would be easier to avoid jumping into the console every time I want to compile.
 I won't be installing anything on this computer so please do not talk about anything else than just the GHC task.

 This is my first post every on reddit I hope I don't get RTFM ed.
 Problem: Until about a week ago I used to use a doom emacs config I got off of the internet with some modifications just for references in latex. this week I finally decided to code my own literate gnu emacs config but there is one feature I am sorely missing. In the image attached in a org-mode document there is syntax highliting for latex code outside of src_code blocks I want that but I don't know how to get it into my new config. Further information can be provided on request.

 First exercise:
  
Using a state of type [(a,Int)] we can keep track of the numbers of occurrences of elements of type a. For instance [('a',1),('x',3)] means that we've seen one 'a' and three 'x's. 
 Implement a State monad operation count that registers the occurrence of the given value. 
 That is, the operation count x should fetch the pair (x,n) from the state, and replace it with the pair (x,n+1). If no such pair is found, the operation should add (x,1) to the state.
  
Examples:
  runState (count True) [] ==> ((),[(True,1)]) runState (count 7) [] ==> ((),[(7,1)]) runState (count 'a') [('a',1),('b',3)] ==> ((),[('a',2)…]]></summary>

 ​
 I'm a long time Emacs user, right now using the Doom framework and, I recently took a look at the power Nix, specifically the devenv.sh project. I wonder if someone is using it in some manner. As it being quite powerful and allowing having separate development environments. 
 ​
 Are there any packages for this?, and if not, how complicated would it to be to for example, once entering a project, Emacs gets all of its PATHs (languages like NodeJS and other niceties) so that little by little, the project can be replicated and used completely with devenv and Emacs without having to installing anything globally.
 ​
 Thank you, I would love to hear your workflows!, just wanting to be sure I'm getting the best of the best in my environment, I will be coding in Javascript, Angular and so on.

Whats up with that? Is it shenanigans involving using Int instead of Integer?

 From what I learned we get the above error when a function get a nil value while expecting a string but I don't understand why the function will get a nil value when i selected the correct executable with appropriate compiler flags.
 I would appreciate any help in the matter.

 I created a template for AoC targeting beginners who want to jump straight to coding and don't want to mess with cabal / stack / dependencies / exectuables ... It main features are:
  
A sensible set of “light” dependencies for AoC (It could be lighter though).
 A very simple bash command-line interface (CLI) which erase the usage of cabal: 
 Create Haskell executable files for each new Advent of Code day.
 Run solutions for each day with ease.
 Automatically manage Cabal files, reducing setup hassles.
 
 VSCode tasks for seamless interaction with the CLI. Press CTRL+Shift+P to open the command panel and type “run task” to see all available tasks.
  
It follows some different approaches than other templates. Mainly
  
each day is a single self-contained executable instead of modules
 you don't have to touch cabal file If you don't want to
 has built-in integration with VSCode, via tasks
 Has more dependencies
  
None of the above guarantees a better experience
 VSCode integration
 This is how vscode task look like:

I used it for a long time (and I'm still using it in the evenings), but I'm not totally happy with it. I'd like to spend a little more time on it, changing some colors, updating the slightly outdated screenshots in the readme and so on. While I'm at it, I could have a look at packages that don't work well with it as well. I have some other ideas for themes, and an improved naga would also give me a better base to work from for these.
 I'd be glad if some of you could maybe test-drive it and give me feedback, especially if it perhaps breaks or looks plain bad with some packages you use.
 The main idea of the theme was to get a "more modern retro green" theme, with high contrast, but a non-standard foreground color -- green in this case.
 Thanks in advance!

In other applications fullscreen omits the entire top height of the notch, but for some reason Emacs fullscreen isn't like other native fullscreen - the Emacs frame occupies the entire screen but is still in the Desktop space. So I lose words in the middle of the top line. How can I avoid this situation? I don't see a ns-use-native-fullscreen variable (or any variables containing the words "ns", "native", or "fullscreen" that are useful).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello emacs and Lisp enthusiasts,
 I remember seeing an article that talked about the superfluity of parenthesis in Lisp code, and how non-Lisp programmers were overwhelmed by them, but Lisp programmers had trained their eyes to look at indentation structure and didn't see the parenthesis, and it showed an image of Lisp code without and with the parenthesis faded. I don't have a link to the article, but even as a slightly seasoned Lisper I thought the fainter parenthesis improved readability. 
 So I'm wondering if/how it's possible to achieve this effect in emacs. Is there already a minor-mode for it? Would it involve a font-lock/face for parenthesis? I've tried to navigate the syntax highlighting code before and was a bit turned off by the apparent complexity, so any form of introduction would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ultra-scroll-mac: scroll like lightning
 Emacs-mac is a beautiful port, and was the first to offer pixel-precise smooth scrolling nearly a decade ago. But with modern high-resolution trackpads and high density displays, I found its scrolling handlers just couldn't keep up. On large, full-screen buffers in a heavy mode, trackpad scrolling verged on painful, and, maddeningly, was much worse in one direction than the other. And no wonder: modern trackpads deliver scroll events >50⨉ per second! The other key problem with all known smooth scrolling packages is they tend to stutter and loop back as you try to scroll across images taller than the window.
 This package solves both of these problems:
  
Scrolling performance has been increased 25-50⨉ — you move your fingers, the page responds, instantly.
 Large image handling has been worked around so you can scroll right across them without any hiccups.
 As a bonus, dumb mice get pretty good smooth(-ish) scrolling too.
  
I'll be contributing the core scrolling functions upstream, so hopefully pixel-precision-scroll-mode (which inspired this package, and is recommended on other builds) can make use of some of these improvements in the future.
 Finally, this was all (to me) surprisingly hard to achieve, which you can read all about if you are a glutton.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a Haskell course that has the following question.
 ​
  
Below you'll find a type Result that works a bit like Maybe, but there are two different types of "Nothings": one with and one without an error description. 
 Implement the instance Functor Result
  
data Result a = MkResult a | NoResult | Failure String deriving (Show) 
 My solution:
 instance Functor Result where fmap f (MkResult x) = MkResult (f x) fmap _ NoResult = NoResult fmap _ (Failure desc) = Failure desc 
 Notice that NoResult and Failure are both passthrough, but replacing those with fmap _ x = x produces the following compilation error.
  • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘b’ Expected: Result b Actual: Result a ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: fmap :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> Result a -> Result b at Set12.hs:57:3-6 ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: fmap :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> Result a -> Result b at Set12.hs:57:3-6 • In the expression: x In an equation for ‘fmap’: fmap _ x = x In the instance declaration for ‘Functor Result’ • Relevant bindings include x :: Result a (bound at Set12.hs:58:10) fmap :: (a -> b) -> Result a -> Result b (bound at Set12.hs:57:3) | 58 | fmap _ x = x | ^ 
 Is there a way to avoid the boilerplate pattern matching?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just playing around with Haskell and there are a few things I couldn't understand about the syntax rules of let and do blocks.
 Consider the following code:
 listings = [x | i <- [0..10], let x = i * i, x > 20] -- [25,36,49,64,81,100] 
 I was thinking instead of using this sugar, why not use a do block, which is a more common sugar. So I came up with this, following this:
 listing = do i <- [0..10] let x = i * i guard (x > 20) return x 
 I actually prefer removing the do sugar as well, like this:
 listing = [0..10] >>= (\i -> let x = i * i in guard (x > 20) >> return x) 
 This got me thinking, can I use do so that I can avoid >>= and >>, but also keep it a one liner. So I followed this, this and this and got the following to work:
 listing = do {i <- [0..10]; let {x = i * i} in do guard (x > 20); return x} 
 But I was hoping for something like this, which did not work:
 listing = do {i <- [0..10]; let x = i * i; guard (x > 20); return x} 
 I am not really sure why. But I figured it might be because of let. I tried to get rid of it but I wasn't able to, unless I just remove all sugar and have something like this:
 listing = [0..10] >>= (\i -> (\x -> guard (x > 20) >> return x) (i * i)) 
 Which is, funnily enough, shorted then the do version. Long story short, I don't understand the rules of do and let. Can someone explain in simple terms? By the way, is let also sugar, it doesn't seem like it to me, because my lambda seems to make a dependency on the ordering of variables, but I'm not sure. I didn't consider using where so I'm not sure of it's behavior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 as nvim-user I am just starting out with orgmode and want to use emacs on 4 systems: 2 linux-boxes and 2 android-systems.
 The linux-boxes run emacs 29, on android (in a termux/proot environment) the emacs version currently is 27.
 I am using emacs only for orgmode with evil-mode and the modus-themes.
 What I want is to have the same environment on all machines and so this is my plan:
 I will use syncthing to sync all my org-files as well as the init.el between all machines and in the init.el I will only load packages with use-package.
 So the idea is that when I e.g. introduce a new package on one machine, the new config is synced to the other machines and when I start emacs there the package is installed automatically - everything stays in sync.
 My question: Would that work in practice or are there pitfalls I am not aware of?

 The book was written for Scala 2, so it can be cumbersome to translate it page by page to a newer syntax, and I wanted to ask:
 Is there any book that gives you introduction to up-to-date language features as much as giving you full overview of language as in "Programming in Scala"?

 every time I try to get into orgmode (which is great) I have to deal with emacs (I ususally use nvim) and I feel that regardless of any productivity boost orgmode may give me, I will never recover the time I have wasted with emacs configuration issues - it seems to be just a very, very fragile ecosystem...
 Here is the latest problem:
 I want to use the modus-operandi theme and have added a use-package clause copied from the documentation.
 But now when I open emacs I get a prompt, informing me that loading a theme can run lisp code and if I wanted to proceed, I say yes, I am asked if this theme should be deemed safe for future sessions, I say yes and then the theme loads fine - but only for this sesssion.
 When I close emacs the whole thing starts again, so my question is: How can I get rid of this annoying prompt?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr I'm a noob using DooM and it seems I don't understand variables
 Firstly; please forgive the gratuitous image of my RGB Steamdeck / Corne / DOOM Emacs "coffee shop" setup - I'm just enjoying it at the mo, and have a burning desire to share.
 After a quick play with Zone I'm trying to setup zone-matrix as my "screensaver"
 I did the following:
  
Pulled the files from zone-matrix githib to .emacs.d/zone/
 Added the following to my in my config.el. I realised I was comitting heresy for copying another person's config (from a stackexchange answer) and braced myself for errors; 
  
``` (defun tabbar-mode () (lambda (x) (message "%s"))) (add-to-list 'load-path (concat dotfiles-dir "zone")) (require 'zone-matrix) (require 'zone-matrix-settings) (require 'zone-settings)
 (setq zone-programs [zone-matrix]) (zone-when-idle 60) ```
 After a doom sync I get an (to be honest expected) error void-variable dotfiles-dir.
 The issue I have is with the definition dotfiles-dir - I clearly don't have that variable set, and wonder which of the following is the least-worst approach:
  
Because I'm on DooM there is probably already a similar variable set linking to .config/doom/ am I better putting the zone directory in there? If so, do I hard-code the path in the line containing dotfiles-dir?
 
Should I define a dotfiles-dir or zone-matrix-dir instead? I assume that flies in the face of dotfile conventions?
 
 I'd love to hear your thoughts

 https://git.sr.ht/~sebasmonia/emacs-utils
 Story below:
 I've had versions of a piece of code to pull info from JIRA, in private repos associated with different jobs, for years now.
 When I started my current gig I realized I should put that code in a public place, and maybe someone would write a "proper" JIRA package out of it. If anything, this lets you read details and comments (doesn't do inline images nor attachments). I find it useful in its current state and maybe some of you will too. 
 And last weekend I wrote a Confluence reader. After being BEYOND ANNOYED that you can't read pages without JS.I remember the old (and good) versions of Confluence that didn't force the fancy editor down your throat and you could write everything in wiki markup...anyway.
 The reader detects when a link isn't external, so it doesn't send you to EWW. It doesn't work in 100% of the cases, will probably revisit that code. 
 Oh and both JIRA and Confluence support Emacs' bookmarks, thank to EWW's implementation and our beloved editor being open in the truest sense of the word.

 When I'm viewing an email in emacs, I sometimes want to be able to find it in outlook, maybe I want to reply using outlook or maybe it would look better in outlook.
 Previously I would copy the message-id of the email with emacs, then use a VBA function in outlook to find and open the same email in outlook, which works fine, but it's a bit slow and convoluted.
 Then I found out recently instead of doing that, I could just copy the maildir file as an .eml file and use outlook to open it(here it is necessary to change the line ending to CRLF).
 Maybe I'm just stating the obvious here :)

 My best guess is that these refer to colour depths, but I'm feeling a bit out of my depth here (hah!). My questions are as follows:
  
How does Emacs decide which colour/depth to use?
 Are these fields all required, or are they customary/nice to have?
 Why are some colours hexes and others strings? Do the strings refer to some table somewhere with more hexes?
  
I would be extremely grateful for any clarity and/or links to relevant documentation where I can learn more!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 at my alma mater we are holding a course on Haskell for the students, and one of the initiatives as part of that course is that students can optionally participate in solving Advent Of Code in Haskell, where they can discuss on our Discord how they solved the tasks, ask for help, and learn together, with other students but also with us teachers. It is a way to get them a bit more excited about Haskell and give them a taste of how Haskell fares on a competition like this.
 In order to make it easier for them to get going with it, and to save them from pitfalls of setting up a project in Cabal, I created this template github repo: https://github.com/Martinsos/aoc-2023-haskell-template .
 I am sharing it here in case anybody has some feedback on how it can be improved, and maybe it also helps somebody else here to get started with AoC in Haskell!
 Regarding improvement advice: keep in mind that we want to keep it simple for relative newcomers to Haskell (so no Nix :D!).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, sometimes I try something new to compare with already used packages, this weekend I wanted to try Eglot, however, I ran into a number of problems. One of them is autocomplete.
 For example, when I write in vue, I want to autocomplete a watch function. This function is available in the following packages
 import { watch } from 'vue'; import { watch } from 'fs'; import { watch } from 'fs/promises' ... etc 
 But when I use autocomplete in eglot I only see the first candidate - importing from the fs package. Is there any possibility or workaround to display all possible candidates?
 Example of autocomplete with eglot
 https://preview.redd.it/tlgtg5imw43c1.jpg?width=2930&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f0cd2ff1b6733ec26021b77b6e5e392f26921df
 Example of autocomplete with lsp-mode

 I also know that lsp-mode in conjunction with corfu has a similar problem, but it is impossible to solve it there as the authors of both packages think that the problem is not on their side 😅 Is the situation with eglot the same?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had a couple of questions while exploring cabal,
  
What is the difference between cabal install <package> vs adding package name to .cabal and then cabal run/build?
 Where are cabal package dependencies for a project installed (after cabal init)? Couldn't find them in the current directory. I read it can be found in ~/.cabal/packages, but then if they are installed in a common location, how does it manage versions across them? Does it install for every version and use as required for a project? Why not a node-modules like structure?
 Does cabal install behave differently depending on whether .cabal is present in the current directory or not?
 What if after adding a package .cabal, I decided to change my mind and remove it. In the next cabal run/build, will the package be uninstalled from wherever it was stored?
  
Thanks.

 This Doom Emacs install is on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS, and I have also tried Ubuntu 23.10.1 (Mantic Minotaur) and still the same error.
 This is my org-roam configuration:
 (use-package! org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory "~/RoamNotes") (org-roam-completion-everywhere t) (org-roam-dailies-capture-templates '(("d" "default" entry "* %<%I:%M %p>: %?" :if-new (file+head "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n")))) :bind (("C-c n l" . org-roam-buffer-toggle) ("C-c n f" . org-roam-node-find) ("C-c n i" . org-roam-node-insert) :map org-mode-map ("C-M-i" . completion-at-point) :map org-roam-dailies-map ("Y" . org-roam-dailies-capture-yesterday) ("T" . org-roam-dailies-capture-tomorrow)) :bind-keymap ("C-c n d" . org-roam-dailies-map) :config (require 'org-roam-dailies) ;; Ensure the keymap is available (org-roam-db-autosync-mode)) 
 This is the backtrace of the error:
  set-buffer(#<killed buffer>) (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (org-reveal '(4))) (closure ((buf . #<killed buffer>)) nil (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (org-reveal '(4))))() apply((closure ((buf . #<killed buffer>)) nil (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (org-reveal '(4)))) nil) timer-event-handler([t 25958 838 237811 nil (closure ((buf . #<killed buffer>)) nil (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (org-reveal '(4)))) nil nil 85000 nil]) 
 I have tried the following:
  
Delete the org-roam-db and then run org-roam-db-sync.
 Going into emacsql directory >> sqlite and running make.
  
Thank you all in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example, let's say I were to change backward-delete-char-untabify-method for prog-mode buffers. Naively, I'd write something like,
 (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local backward-delete-char-untabify-method 'hungry))) 
 but the documentation recommends against using lambdas in add-hook calls (which makes sense). I can, of course, just make a named function instead of a lambda and pass that to add-hooks. But, rather than do that, is there any other option for setting variables automatically for modes besides a hook like this?
 Also, as a bonus question, if I wanted to also do something like enable show-paren-mode for all prog-mode buffers, which of the following do you consider "better" (assume that this is not something that is likely to change frequently):
 ;; option 1 (defun my-prog-mode-settings () (setq-local backward-delete-char-untabify-method 'hungry)) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'my-prog-mode-settings) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'show-paren-mode) ;; option 2 (defun my-prog-mode-settings () (setq-local backward-delete-char-untabify-method 'hungry) (show-paren-mode)) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'my-prog-mode-settings) 
 Obviously, I realize that it's not really important, but I feel like bike-shedding this morning.

I have never done anything in lisp before and still struggle to understand how single quotes signify a function or what ever.
 With that said, i was also planning on doing AoC this year. Originally i wanted to look into zig or go, but now think that this might be the opportunity to dive into lisp for a bit.
 But with knowing basically nothing: Is this even "viable", or advisable? Should i be looking at common lisp instead? Or would you say that's a pretty dumb idea and i should rather learn it in a different way?

 The ways I've found:
  
Console. An easy way, I've implemented it, but it's too simple. I want graphics.
 
GUI app. Yes, that's what I need. But, I find writing GUIs in Haskell very boring. Also, the user should download and launch an application, which I don't really like
 
 Web-based ways:
  
Web server and application in Haskell. Yes! There are frameworks. But I need a free hosting for Haskell applications. Which, currently, I haven't found.
 
(Haskell code -> JS library) + NodeJS. Perfect. I have no problem that the computation is performed at user side. Currently exploring this way. (And I can't use PureScript)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine selecting a paragraph and having ChatGPT automatically correct grammar and spelling errors, then seamlessly replacing it in your buffer. Well, imagine no more - it's now a reality!
 Here's what it does:
  
Selects the current paragraph in Emacs.
 Sends it to ChatGPT for a grammar and spelling check.
 Replaces the original text with the corrected version, all within Emacs.
  
Inception: 
 The other night I read a post on X that said LLMs would be used to enhance word prediction for texting on phones. I thought another interesting application would be to easily bring spelling and grammar fixes to whatever I'm editing in emacs.
 It's not flawless, but in my experience, it's all I need.
 Here's a video example: https://youtu.be/hrhoNE2M9Qw

I’ve developed a new library to filter local files in Nix
which I’d like to introduce!
This post requires some familiarity with Nix and its language.
So if you don’t know what Nix is yet,
take a look first,
it’s pretty neat.
In this post we’re going to look at what source filtering is,
why it’s useful,
why a new library was needed for it,
and the basics of the new library.
This post notably won’t really teach you a lot about the new library,
that’s what the official tutorial
and the reference documentation is for.
But if you’d like to know some background and motivation, please read on!

 Im quite new so please excuse my ignorance.Im currently running doom emacs, and REALLY love it, but i have a few problems which im trying to tackle one at a time.
 The current problem i have is that when i mark a TODO as "DONE", it still shows up in org agenda weekly schedule view. I did some googling, and have currently tried this:
 (setq org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t) (setq org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t) (setq org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-done t) (setq org-agenda-skip-function-global '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done)) 
 None of these options have helped me so far :/
 Worth to point out is that Im using custom labels in doom emacs, so ill paste them here as well, just to double check that the issue isnt there:
  (setq org-todo-keywords ; This overwrites the default Doom org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO(t)" ; A task that is ready to be tackled "ASMT(a)" ; Assignment "EXAM(e)" ; Exam "PRESNT(p)" ; Presentation "MAIL(m)" ; Mail "MEET(M)" ; Meeting "IDEA(i)" ; Ideas to be done "PROJ(P)" ; A project that contains other tasks "CHORES(c)" ; Chores that needs to be done "LEISURE(l)" ; Leisure / Hobby stuff "APPOINTMENT(A)" ; Scheduled appointments "REMINDER(r)" ; Reminder "WAIT(w)" ; Something is holding up this task "|(k)" ; The pipe necessary to separate "active" states and "inactive" states "DONE(d)" ; Task has been completed "CANCELLED(c)" ) ; Task has been cancelled (sequence "[ ](T)" "[-](S)" "[?](W)" "[X](D)" ) (sequence "OKAY(o)" "YES(y)" "NO(n)" )) org-todo-keyword-faces '( ("TODO" .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 So I know if emacs is lagging I should run the profiler for a bit while it's lagging and then review the report. However, I'm not sure what to do next. 
 It looks clear that company / completion is responsible for the laggy behavior here, especially a jsonrpc-request made by completion. That makes sense, there's a slow network call somewhere in the works that's gumming things up.
 I'm using eglot for lsp and would expect that would be the source of a slow jsonrpc call, maybe eglot trying to get completion candidates on every keystroke through the LSP server? But I don't understand the stack here well enough to know how to proceed in debugging or fixing things.
 Would love any help. Knowing what to fix is great - but also I'm really interested in knowing how to know what to do next in general in this scenario.
 Thanks!

This is an idea I've been experimenting with for a few years, and I'm happy to finally release it! I've used this approach on multiple professional projects, and it is currently being used at the National Solar Observatory. It combines the best ideas of Tailwindcss and Elm-UI with Haskell.
  
Github
 Hackage
  
​
 myPage = col (gap 10) $ do el (bold . fontSize 32) "My page" button (border 1) "Click Me" 
 Instead of relying on CSS's poor programming features, we can use normal Haskell functions to factor and reuse our app's styles
 header = bold h1 = header . fontSize 32 h2 = header . fontSize 24 page = gap 10 myPage = col page $ do el h1 "My Page" ... 
 It has more features, including
  
Intuitive Layouts with `row`, `col`, `grow` and `space`
 Embedded page-specific CSS
 Stateful styles (like hover) and responsive designs
  
Any and all questions or feedback welcome! The reasoning behind using utility classes for CSS is explained well here. Also, stay tuned in the coming weeks for the upcoming release of Hyperbole, a server-only interactive web-framework that leverages this library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For my hobby desktop c/c++ projects I started using emacs, and I really like it. I made my own config, which contains only a couple of packages like vertico, lsp-mode, company etc.
 Professionally I am an embedded systems consultant, working with lot of different uC-s and IDE-s. I have a bigger job currently where I have to work with PIC32 uC, and the project is created with MPLAB X IDE. I wanted use emacs and lsp-mode, but it seems that clangd could not find some of the headers. I have generated the compile_commands.json with a python script called compiledb, but it is not working properly.... maybe clangd can not understand some of the compile flags from xc32-cc ? (the mplab compiler).
 Anyone tried this stuff? Thx for help.

 http://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_functions
 I see this as problematic, because whether a function is partial is mostly a question of type. But to ensure valid values for a specific type, for example all numbers from zero to 2^16 - 1 (unsigned 16-bit integer) or "Natural" as a subset of Haskell's "Integer", you need a smart constructor that produces an error message for incorrect number arguments; a function that behaves partially relative to the values of an original type such as "Integer". Would it be practical here to always work with an optional type, Haskell's "Maybe"? I don't think so! Because that would result in almost all types being "maybe" and the code be littered with unnecessary pattern matching.

 What would be the fastest way to search for this? Is there a way to do a search like rename tag=dired, or similar, in a folder w/subfolders, across all my org-mode notes?
 I should also mention that I really don't want to install any extra packages for this.

 Thing is, this does not happen when I'm on the vpn for work!
 My two other computers at home experience the exact same issue. These two don't have any vpn software installed, just plain debian. The computer with the vpn is a Windows 10 with WSL2 running debian as well. I use cntlm when on the vpn and I set my proxy accordingly. On my plain debian home boxes I don't use any proxy. I use the same .emacs file on all three machines.
 Was it a debian apt-get update that did this to me? I have no idea. Anyone here with a similar issue?

 ./emacs-29.1.90: error while loading shared libraries: libgpm.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 When I try to move the whole directory (source code and the build directories inside there) out of the virtual machine into the Host and try to run make install (this is after make and compilation completed) it says 
 make install if [ -x ./config.status ]; then \ ./config.status --recheck; \ else \ ../configure --cache-file=/dev/null; \ fi /bin/sh: line 4: ../configure: Permission denied make: *** [Makefile:573: config.status] Error 126 
 I have tried to chown -R <myusername>:<mygroup> ./ to the whole directory but it still gives me the permission denied.
 Any ideas how I might accomplish this task?
 Thanks!

 "stack ghci .\Factors.hs" can correctly load it.
 I install package by: stack install parallel
 It is so confusing, I configure the dev environment for hours, still not working.
 I uninstall and install GHCup already, I have no idea how to install Haskell and parallel package correctly.
 my WSL ubuntu is also broken, by removing stack.yaml will make the error disappear but still has the same problem that cannot recongnize parallel package.

 Now, I want to setup a correct dev environment.
 Looks like vscode or hsl extension don't knokw the stack package.
 How to make stack package can be found by vscode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently had a situation where I wanted all maximal elements of a list. Base has maximum but that just gives a single element. A maximal function that gives all maximal elements would be a straight forward generalization with the added benefit that it’s defined for the empty list. Then one could just have
 maximum = head . maximal 
 On Hoogle I couldn’t find something like this. Neither in base nor any package. 
 Very often when I think "why is this not in base?" it turns out that there actually is something and what I wanted is just a special case. Or you can trivially compose it out of other functions. Does this apply here?
 I also noticed, when I tried to define maximal for Foldable instead of lists, I did not know how to do it without specializing the return type (ie list). Is that possible? And if not, is that maybe the problem why it’s not in base?

 I've encountered a significant issue: whenever I enable python-ts-mode, Emacs consumes all my system's memory and crashes. While I've managed to use a more basic setup that limits tree-sitter to syntax highlighting only, I can't shake the feeling that I'm missing out on some great functionality.

I am running on a Mac
 The bare minimum to reproduce this problem is on the following gist: https://gist.github.com/hnarayanan/a6397d6723fce19e2802d4305071e611
 I happen to use Emacs from MacPorts, but to double-check, I also attempted to download it from https://emacsformacosx.com and it crashed in the same way
 This seems to happen independent of the language server used in the backend. I intend on using python-lsp-server, but it fails even if I don't have it installed.
  
Has anyone faced a similar problem and found a solution? Perhaps I am doing something very wrong with my config? I'm eager to learn from your experiences and would greatly appreciate any advice or tips you can offer.
 Thank you!
 ⚠️Edit⚠️
 This appears to be something inherently broken with tree-sitter as installed by MacPorts (or the particular language grammar for Python). I decided to dig into this and built both tree-sitter and Emacs from scratch, and they work really well together without my memory problems.

 could someone please explain how to get org-caldav to work with a radicale-server as I don't know what I am doing wrong...
 Or maybe give an org-mode noob a tip on how to debug such issues as I have tried and given up on orgmode several times in the past.
 So I have a radicale server that works with my android-clients and I am trying to sync with org using this in my init.el:
  (use-package org-caldav :ensure t :config (progn (setq org-caldav-url "http://10.10.10.100:5232") (setq org-caldav-calendar-id "mh") (setq org-caldav-inbox "/home/mh/test/calendar/cal.org")) ) 
 But when I then run org-caldav sync I am prompted for username and password and the eventual message "CalDAV sync finished. Nothing was done".
 So how do I get this to work?
 Many thanks!

 The roadblocks to this plan seem to be:
  
ScalablyTyped/Converter doesn't (yet) support the generation of Laminar Web Components, but only React and Slinky. The path of least resistance is to augment this tool to generate Laminar Web Components, too, but I have no clue how to do that (yet), or even if this is the optimal path.
 I'm fairly new to this ecosystem, so I'm looking for pointers, effort estimates, existing implementations, help, ideas, etc. before I launch in this direction. I'm surprised this doesn't exist already because, to me, it is a winning combination! path.

 Existing things I've researched but I'm not interested in (so please don't bother suggesting them):
  
Things like the incomplete and archived Laminar Web Components because it is unmaintained, outdated, and based on a complicated generator that is only known to work on Material UI 3
 The st-material-ui repository because it only generates for ReactJS or Slinky right now, although the approach used by this library is nearly exactly what I want if it only supported Laminar Web Components
  
Thanks in advance for any thoughts you may have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Calc'c elisp functions (imho) all have the prefix calcFunc-. So in order to use a calc function like vlen in an org table lisp formula, one could use calcFunc-vlen. That's nice.
 What bothers me is the lack of "on-line" documentation (i.e. usable with eldoc or completion frameworks).
 All calc functions are nicely documented here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html , thats good.
 It is possible to modify a elisp's function documentation. e.g. like so:
 (put 'calcFunc-vlen 'function-documentation "Computes the length of a vector. The length of a non-vector is considered to be zero. Note that matrices are just vectors of vectors for the purposes of this command.") 
 Now calcFunc-vlen would have a nice "on-line" documentation, usable with C-h f, autocompletion and eldoc.
 Has anyone already bothered to gather some of those strings from the manual, in a more machine processable form? So I could save some work to create "on-line" documentation of the calc functions?
 Edit: following screenshots are intended to make it clear, what I want it for:
 company completion and echo help
 ivy ivy-rich and function docstrings

 instance FromJSON FromJSONColumn where

 Read more about the release here: https://simplex.chat/blog/20231125-simplex-chat-v5-4-link-mobile-desktop-quantum-resistant-better-groups.html
 Thanks to work of u/angerman we now can compile mobile apps for iOS and Android with 9.6.3, but iPhone 7 (and earlier) and Android 10 are not supported yet with this build, so it uses GHC 8.10.7 for mobile apps and 9.6.3 in desktop apps.
 Some observation about 9.6.3 on mobile: it seems to have reduced overall CPU usage, but made apps much less responsive. Surprisingly, it was resolved by moving hs_init call to background thread - nothing in the docs suggested that it would made any difference, but it made the apps much more responsive on iOS (yet to test on Android).
 Does anybody know why it could have happened?
 We now use these RTS options that also help responsiveness and reduce memory usage by 10% (when the usage was large): - -A16m (chunk size for new allocations) - -H64m (initial heap size) - -xn (non-moving GC)
 Let me know if you have any comments on these!
 Thank you!

 ( [x | x <- [1 ..], x > 173 && x < 300, x `mod` 3 == 0] :: [Integer] ) 
 Problem is this infinite list version goes crazy because it's not being overruled. Is there a way to, e.g., take just the numbers in the following range clause?

For whatever reason, feeling some order in the midst to the chaos, seemed out of my grasp without spending a lot of time figuring things out. So, I thought to myself, "What if I just started over, and tried out folgezettel even though I think @Sascha has convinced me it shouldn't be necessary?"
Well, I have to report early that, while I feel like someone that should be able to workout without the need for a personal trainer, I like the personal trainer... a lot.
I don't know what it is! But, there is something about the id's and just needing to loosely relate one to the next one that helps to create focus and clarity.
I'm sorry for this moment, leaving: 20231125055521 -- At least for now. Maybe one day, I'll be able to exercise without a personal trainer. But, today, I'm just happy I'm working out.]]></summary>

 Given that I'm writing a library, when interacting with this library as a consumer would you expect to interact with it in the context of a monad, or is there some pattern that avoids this?

 I am not sure if many people are using alerts for the appointments, I do, I like the behavior where it brings Emacs to the front and shows a message in the mini buffer. However, when I am quickly writing in another application I sometimes end up writing in the active buffer. I am contemplating creating a function which puts the buffer in read only mode before showing switching to Emacs, if it was not already Read Only, and restores it when the reminder disappears. That should be enough to avoid accidental writing.
 Before I embark in that task I would like to know if anybody has done anything like that, or any other creative ideas to avoid contaminating the current buffer.
 Thanks!

 Lennart gave a presentation about combinators and graph reduction at the FP seminars at Chalmers a few months ago. He wrote a little implementation to demo at the talk, and just never stopped writing code. Today he came back and gave a presentation about MicroHaskell. It is an "extended subset" of Haskell, which is compiled to combinators and evaluated via graph reduction, implemented by a runtime-system written in 2500 lines of C.
 Here is a recording of the presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk5SJ79nOnA
 Here is his repo: https://github.com/augustss/MicroHs
 I hope some of you find it as interesting as we did :)

 hi all,
 I installed emacs using
  
brew install --cask emacs
  
when I launch Emacs from the terminal with
  
emacs
  
None of the keystrokes respond in emacs and all show up in the terminal window.
 I'm running:
  
Macbook pro m3 max
 Sonoma 14.1 (23B2073)
  
Never had this problem when emacs was previously installed on my macs. Any ideas on what the issue might be?
 thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Commit Mono font has a feature that it calls "smart kerning". Monaspace has a similar feature that it calls "texture healing." Characters are moved around slightly, or swapped out for a slightly larger or smaller character to even out the spacing, for example, when a wide character like an 'm' is followed by a narrow character like an 'l'. 
 The effect looks nice on their web sites. It worked in VSCode, but not in Emacs. The "smart kerning" / "texture healing" features did not seem to be activated when I tried the fonts in Emacs. 
 How would I get this to work in Emacs? The Monaspace docs say you have to add "'calt'" to "editor.ligatures" in the VSCode Settings. Commit Mono just worked without changing the settings.
 I might end up hating the moving around, but I'd have to try it for a few hours to see. I'm just not sure how to set that up in Emacs, or if Emacs supports that sort of thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm running into an issue where Emacs (Spacemacs if relevant) would complain about invalid UTF-8 characters in the temp file buffer that was generated when saving a file I was editing with EPA. Telling me to select a fallback coding system.
 ``` These default coding systems were tried to encode the following problematic characters in the buffer ‘ temp file’:
 Coding System Pos Codepoint Char
 utf-8 1 #x3FFF84 �
 ... ```
 I don't think this makes sense, obviously the encrypted file would have bad UTF-8 characters but why would Emacs complain about this? This file is an org-mode file that was encrypted with GPG. The warning pops up reliably a few seconds after I save, and sporadically when I'm editing. It is making it unusable because it pops up even after I select an option.
 Any suggestion on where I could even begin to try fixing this?

 I wrote another beginner-focussed blog about the Table based testing in ScalaTest. 
 https://yadukrishnan.live/effective-test-parameterization-with-scalatest-tables
 This might be too basic for experienced developers. However, during code reviews and other discussions, I have noticed that a lot of test could be converted into Table-based test to improve the readability and maintainability. Hence thought of writing this.
 Please have a look and let me know if you find this useful.
 Thanks!

Plus, I'm worry about locking myself in one app, so I'm exploring the possibility of using Neovim or Emacs, but I'm aware there's a learning curve, and before investing time, I wanted to know if I'm using the right tool.
 I need to do the following in a quick way:
 1- Encrypt a whole folder, and acces it. This folder will keep other folders with pictures and text files.
 2- Set a number of columns for the page, like 80 or 100.
 3- Have a tree-like explorer on the left, to navigate the files with the entries.
 4- Do bold, italics, and different colors.
 5- Make an index or a different way to navigate the entries, besides the tree explorer.
 6- Export everything in case I want to change the program I use to read my entries.
 7- Inserting an image from a folder, like a picture I took. It can be a miniature to click and open the original picture.
 Can Emacs do that? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who have reservations about the syntax of comprehensions, and there are a few, here's one possible alternative
 The approach is to extend an existing function to handle additional argument types, so that it replicates a comprehension via a single function call. For instance a function of two integers is among other things extended to also apply to two ranges of integers. There are some similarities with vectorization (see R, MATLAB, Julia and the like), although here you don't have to mix row vectors and column vectors.
 It's a kind of Polish notation for comprehensions: you're saying the same thing as before, but everything has been rearranged, and the main function comes first. Perhaps not unlike the original Polish notation, it takes some getting used to, and won't be to everyone's taste. But there are arguably a few advantages:
  
no need for specialized syntax: no on-the-fly variable bindings, so no left-arrows (or "for" or "yield")
 generally more concise notation that meshes well with Scala's use of underscores for lambda functions
 a direct style that can be used with effect handling, e.g. with Cats or ZIO
 a clear distinction between independent and dependent terms, determined by the static types
  
This last property means that by default the library is a bit of a hybrid of David Turner's original list comprehension (which can handle any case, but always returns a sequence), and a more Julia-style array comprehension when things are "rectangular". This makes it straightforward to plot a function (via JavaScript and plotly). It also means an inherent distinction between the parallelizable and the sequential, i.e. applicatives and - the term was bound to crop up eventually - monads.
 Essentially it's a function-centric version of comprehensions, for those who would prefer not to use specialized syntax or macros, or maybe just want comprehensions in Java.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/emacs! First-time poster here!
 I recently wanted to visualise some data in org-mode using a Python source block to generate an image, which was then rendered directly in the buffer.
 It took my a couple of goes to work out how to do it. 
 Given some data like this:
 ```org
 +begin_src bash :results output file :file data.njson
 echo '{"name": "Spock", "editor": "Emacs"} {"name": "James Kirk", "editor": "Vim"} {"name": "Dr McCoy", "editor": "Vim"} {"name": "Scotty", "editor": "Emacs"} {"name": "Worf", "editor": "ed"} {"name": "Geordi LaForge", "editor": "Emacs"} {"name": "Data", "editor": "Emacs"} {"name": "Jean-luc Picard", "editor": "VS Code"} {"name": "Wesley Crusher", "editor": "VS Code"} {"name": "William Riker", "editor": "Vim"} '
 +end_src
 ```
 A visualisation can be rendered as follows:
 ```org
 +begin_src python :results output file :file usage.png
 import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import sys
 df = pd.read_json("data.njson", lines=True) axes = sns.histplot(df, x="editor") axes.get_figure().savefig(sys.stdout.buffer)
 +end_src
 ```
 The main trick here is to set the :results output file header argument to write the output to a file, and to save the figure to sys.stdout.buffer from Python.
 I've written about this on my blog too, where you can see the [unsurprising] results of the analysis!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr why do my org links not have a space before them (e.g. check out thisLINK)? I feel I'm missing something very basic here.
 I was using org-roam today in doom emacs and forgot how irritating adding a new node is while writing. 
 It nestles nicely up to the text before it - with no space in between. After posting on r/orgroam a kind soul told me this might be a wider issue - at least related to org itself, and maybe doom.
 Does anyone know how to get a leading space before the node name / link? For example; my nodes come out looking like:
 something interesting is in thisNODENAME/LINK check it out
 For the love of RMS I want a space between this and NODENAME
 I'm clearly being dumb, but can't figure this out. Surely enough people use emacs / doom emacs / org mode, and they are not all adding links everywhere with no leading space?
 A suggestion on r/orgroam was put a double space before a link - is that it?

 Solution 2 gets accepted but Solution 1 gets timedout for 2 test cases. They look and feel exactly the same, so wth is going on? What compiler black magic is under hood for this one?
 Solution 2 literally generates the frikin pascal tree and then indexes into that, shouldn't this be slow compared to the bottom up approach which only looks at the previous row entry of size k?

symbols away from C/C++ build artifacts to save space and time when building
large codebases. Note that we want to retain access to the debug symbols if and
when they are needed at a later date, hence we don’t want to merely remove
(aka strip) the debug symbols.1
This exploration is largely inspired and based on what I have learned in various
places around the web, most notably:
Improving C++ Builds with Split DWARF, by Martin Richtarsky
Building for Linux, the smart way, by Leszek Godlewski
along with various experiments of my own, outlined below.
This article will focus on ELF files on Linux.
For other formats and platforms, things are likely to be
quite different. The compiler/toolchain below is based on GCC, but…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FunFixture class looks like it works well when you have one or two indepenent items that need to be set up for the test. However, in my more complicated tests, I tend to have many things that need to be set up and which depend on each other.
 At the moment, using an ad-hoc set up like
 ​
 class MySuite extends munit.FunSuite: var foo: Foo = null var bar: Bar = null var quz: Quz = null var xyzzy: Xyzzy = null override def beforeEach(context: BeforeEach): Unit = foo = Foo() bar = Bar(foo) quz = bar.getQuz xyzzy = Xyzzy(foo, quz) widget = Widget(foo, bar) test("complicated") { val results = widget.doStuff(xyzzy) assertEquals(results, xyzzy + foo.use(bar).use(quz)) } 
 I'm not seeing a good way to write this with FunFixture My best guess is something like
 class MySuite extends munit.FunSuite: val foo = FunFixture[Foo](setup = _ => Foo()) val bar = FunFixture[Bar](setup = _ => Bar(howDoIGetTheValueOfFoo())) val quz = FunFixture[Quz](setup = _ => somehowGetBar().getQuz val xyzzy = FunFixture[Xyzzy](setup = _ => Xyzzy(getFoo(), getQuz()) val widget = FunFixture[Widget](setup = _ => Widget(getFoo(), getBar()) // Make everything into one fixture with some impressively ugly code val everything = FunFixture.map2(FunFixture.map2(foo, bar), FunFixture.map3(quz, xyzzy, widget)) // Run the test. Make sure you get the parentheses nesting right! everything.test("complicated) { ((f, b), (q, x, w)) => val results = w.doStuff(x) assertEquals(results, x + f.use(b).use(q)) } 
 By this point, ad-hoc is looking simple and clean. And that's assuming that howDoIGetTheValueOfFoo can even be written and doesn't make it look even more complicated. And I'm not even certain you can unwrap the parameters like I did, so there may be more boilerplate just trying to get the actual values out.

 so my question is, Is it worth it?
 like what is the level of mastery do i need to achieve to start implementing custom elisp in my configs to enhance my emacs experience?
 and how exactly can i improve my emacs experience if i learned elisp?
 in other words, how rewarding it would be

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was solving a couple of problems on hackerrank using haskell and I came across a question where the Data.Vector package might be useful. So ideally what I would like is since vector is not available by default, is to install it where ghc and ghci is able to see it and import Data.Vector and :m Data.Vector just works and call it a day. Kind of like in c, where you sudo apt install <package>, and #include <package> works.
 Apparently for some reason it seems like a very difficult task to do. Every website/forum which I read suggest to set up a full fledged application with cabal init and then cabal install. 
 I learned that cabal packages and ghc packages are two different things (cabal list --installed and ghc-pkg list). Both maintain their own package databases (installed packages) and ghc and ghci can only see and work with ghc packages. Theres this command cabal install --libs but people on github are saying it can cause some issues and suggest against it (with one person saying it outright "evil"). 
 I couldn't find a straightforward solution to this except years old articles and tons of open issues on github with people having similar problems.
 Is there no simple way to achieve this than to manually download or cabal init?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I get deeper into learning haskell I have noticed what seems to be "Imperative Creep" for the lack of a better term.
 It seems as the code gets more "real world" it becomes ever more imperative. In many examples across the web I see code very similar to the imperative style of a language like python. I'm not really understanding the point of all the great functional aspects of the language if you can't write functional code for real world use cases.
 I't's very confusing for a beginner to wrap their brains around the functional paradigm. Then, almost immediately after understanding this new programming concept you're hit with the Monad and all the educational literature starts you a new with imperative code - it's maddening. Every tutorial explains that "do" notation makes it easier to grok the monad by allowing a more imperative approach. WTF.
 I'm not changing any minds for certain. But, honestly I think this "crutch" has hampered my absorption of the learning material and perhaps increased the learning curve. Additionally this also makes the beautiful syntax of haskell look more like some JS crap with all the "do" "if" and "case", I mean really you can't use functors, applicatives or monads with "pattern-matching", "guards" and "where". Perhaps I have not learned anything of functional programming?
 I'm just ranting, apologies for the negative vibes. Probably delete post after some self-reflection.

 So far, Metanote has comprehensively supported the customization options for Org mode's Agenda view, including settings for tags, properties, subtasks, and most of the major InBufferSettings. I won't list them all here, but you can find detailed documentation.
  
InBufferSettings
 Agenda views
 A Simple and Effective GTD Workflow
  
This weekend (November 24-27), I hosted a promotional event. If Metanote has brought convenience and value to your life and work, this might be a good time to get it.
 Upcoming Features:
  
Custom Capture
 Visibility Cycling and Rich Text
 Roam Research and Backlinks
  
Thank you all.

 I think I can explain the functions pretty well, but I’d love to have a definition of an F-algebra that someone outside of the abstract-algebra/category theory bubble could grok.
 I should say, I’m also outside of those bubbles and only have a functional understanding of it. I can write you a type which is the F-algebra of another with no idea of what that means, only why I’d want to!

I rechecked load-path lists and move packages to another one directory mentioned in load-path lists, which is loacted in Emacs installtion directory named site-lisp. THEN (use-pakage xxx) returned to normal and didn't rose a warning.
 It's so weird, and I just want to set a custom packages load-path. Does anyone know what goes wrong?

 Is that behaviour unique to helm's completing read implementation, or do other such functions exist?
 I need to create an SQL command from a selection from a long list of databases and need something that can pick them individually with highlighting, so once I press Enter, the selection is passed to a function.
 The default completing-read-multiple of typing a match and adding a comma is not suitable for this.
 UPDATE
 After some more searching I've come across this Embark discussion which may help me in what I need. I just need that kind of functionality in a completing-read command, basically something which lets me mark a list of items from a list and apply some arbitrary action to them.

Lately I have been using VScode, as the notebook experience for data science is very good and emacs cannot really compete here as notebooks are web based since the beggining, and vscode is an electron app. Packages like ein was just an ok replacement. Also I have been using logseq instead of org-mode, as the android app is very good and allow me to add stuff from the camera and using the pen with the whiteboard. I am mainly using org-mode to define large project files and leaving logseq for note taking.

 A few times, I would like to do that with probability distributions. It's rarer, but if I had a handy tool, I'd do that a lot of times.
 A range or a distribution could not have a valid Num instance (mostly because it has no notion of sign), but it could have a perfectly valid Field instance. Is there such a library already?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I would like to implore the gurus around here, could you show me some magic to make this declaration shorter?
 I have this code: ~~~ getSearchV2 a = withRequestEncrypted a proc
 where
 proc :: ProcEncrypted {} (Array Int)
 proc c b zgCode cred = do
 pure $ Just [12]
 ~~~
 It would be nice if I can make it like this: ~~~ getSearchV2 a = withRequestEncrypted a $ \c b zgCode cred -> do
 pure $ Just [12] ~~~
 but I got the error: ~~~ The inferred type 
 forall t274. ReadForeign t274 => Config -> Context -> Effect Unit 
 has type variables which are not determined by those mentioned in the body of the type: 
 t274 could not be determined 
 Consider adding a type annotation.
 ~~~
 I suppose ReadForeign comes from the definition of ProcEncrypted. So the question is: - How should I annotate the type ProcEncrypted {} (Array Int) ? - Is this can be used for forall a b. ProcEncrypted a b ?
 Thank you very much for your kind responses dear Gurus, may your light shone brighter and clearer everyday...

 Steps: 1.

A buffer opened on the right side, but the directory is still using the default-directory in step 1 instead of the buffer's directory, causing the buffer to visit ~/lisp/init-lib.el instead of ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-lib.el.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope my question makes sense.
 I am using Doom Emacs for a while now and have become fairly proficient. But I feel like whenever I am browsing emacs content online there are still many topics for me to discover. So I was wondering if there is anything that I might be "missing" yet which might help with my productivity or improve my development skills.
 Sofar I what have learned, on top from my head:
  
Org/Org Agenda (refile etc.)
 Magit
 Vterm
 LSP Commands
 Multiple Cursors
 Literal Config
 Navigating Emacs itself (which key, debugging, reading Emacs-Lisp (abit))
 Using Language specific commands, i.e. send buffer to repl 
 Using Undo with Vundo
  
Only thing I know that I still need to learn is beeing more proficient with vim keybindings, but with that I know where to start.
 I know the question is quite broad, but maybe there some "killer features" worth to explore which I am not aware of yet.
 I'd appreciate any input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am confused of what the workflow when developing with Haskell is these days.
 For example I am not sure whether I should from the very beginning of a project have a .cabal file, i.e. whether I should start all projects by running cabal init first. Shouldn't building a package be one of the last steps in a project?
 What do people do if they, say only want to try out a package? With python for example you would probably create a virtual environment, install the package in it, import it in your source file and go.
 The analog to that solution would be sandboxes I assume, but as far as I understand those are depreciated these days.
 I used Haskell ~3 years ago, always installed packages globally, and then worked mainly with ghci. This was probably not ideal back then, but seems to not even work quite the same way today (cabal install <package> says <package> is not exposed or something along these lines).
 From what I read here, it seems that a "python like workflow" maybe works when working with nix (instead of cabal?).
 Can somebody help lift my confusion? I find it very difficult to get started with Haskell these days, bc I find the tooling and the documentation really confusing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, it's not a troll post.
 I just spent an hour in a tute with our lecturer trying to honestly convince us that emacs/orgmode is literally the best tool for everything ever. Even after someone asked him to add an image to his little demo and it took literally FIVE MINUTES and then he cant even format it or move it on the page.
 Every Youtube tutorial is the same - people typing and typing and tying for 20 minutes at a time to do what I can on my phone in literally 30 seconds. Endless Endless ENDLESS obscure shortcuts and menus inside menus beneath submenus - all with no intuitive or conceptual link to navigate between disconnected dumps of unformatted text.
 Even within a single page, theres never anything resembling a visual cue to explain what youre doing to what. And even when you do figure out what one peice of random highlighting means, you can't get anywhere without typing MORE obscure "shortcuts". HOW is this better than point and click? Who in their right mind would abandon ~30 years of interface progress for this demonstrably worse navigation method?
 I WOULD say it's the worst UX I've ever seen on any utility, ever - except there literally is not UX . All you end up with, everywhere, is a nigh-on-useless bricks of text, only clumsily navigated through with MORE STUPID SHORTCUTS . How anyone could be expected to manage anything with this is beyond all of us.
 Now he expects us to bring lesson summaries to the tute every week in this incomprehensible garbage, and literally NOBODY in the class has ANY idea how to organise anything in what as far as we can tell is just a glorified notepad, or why it even exits.
 What am I missing?
 EDIT: Well, from the look of the downvotes and cope in the comments, this is going to be one of THOSE "open source" communities. So I think I'll drop the course for something useful instead. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neo emacs is a configuration for GNU Emacs which is based on doom emacs and focuses on the java web application coding environment. Here is a detailed tutorial to teach you how to install doom emacs for beginners. And here have many common configurations for beginners too.
 ![img](https://github.com/sincebyte/neo-emacs/blob/master/image-use.png) 
 Neo emacs has the following features:
  
Code completion: Lsp-java supports maven and gradle project.
 Http client: Rest-client is a tool to manually explore and test HTTP REST webservices just like Postman.
 SQL client: Ejc-sql turns Emacs into a simple SQL client which supports various databases.
 Redis client: Eredis Non-blocking Redis client with focus on performance and robustness.
 Terminal emulator: Emacs-libvterm (vterm) is fully-fledged terminal emulator inside GNU Emacs based on libvterm.
 Knowledge management system: Org-roam borrows principles from the Zettelkasten method, providing a solution for non-hierarchical note-taking.
 doomorgstyle: An org html style template similar to doom doc.
  
Here I follow the rules, Try to keep the configuration of doom and enhance it. As a veteran, you may not use neo emacs directly. But the configuration here may also be useful to you! Thanks for the support!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if the following seems dumb. I’m trying to figure something out with cats-effect-3 and scala. I have the following class structure:
 ``` trait Resource { def execute(): F[Output] }
 class A[F[_]] extends Resource { override def execute(): F[Output] = ??? }
 class B[F[_]](a: A[F]) extends Resource { override def execute(): F[Output] = { a.execute().flatMap(…) } } ```
 Each Resource type has an execute method whose output I want to memoize. So that dependent classes (there may be a third class C that can call a.execute) may call it multiple times in any order but they will all get the same value as a result. This would be pretty straightforward with scala’s Future (if I use It instead of F).
 I‘ve seen Async.memoize. However, that changes the signature to F[F[Output]] and I can only execute the “outer” flatMap once, or the results are re-calculated. In this case, I’m not sure how I would allow the dependent classes to use the memoized output.
 I’m relatively new to the Typelevel ecosystem, and I’m not sure if I’m thinking about this correctly. How would I modify the code such that my effect gets executed only once, no matter how many times I call it?
 Should I use the non-typelevel concurrency primitives to handle this outside the effect-system and then wrap it in F?
 I know I can probably orchestrate the “graph” of execution without having each dependent class doing this. But I need to chain the calls these way for the time being.
 ——
 UPDATE [2023/11/20]: For now, I’m going with an AtomicCell that wraps an Option value, and setting it to Some if it’s None (the initial value) using evalUpdateAndGet. This doesn’t seem very elegant though.

The first 2 share some overlap, don't know if I should combine them. Tried to stay true to the 1 idea per note thing. All tips are welcome so dont hold back!

Quote:


Communication with a zettelkasten favors an open system without hierarchy, structure and/or order, but instead focuses on making connections. While communicating with your zettelkasten the openness could lead to unexpected connections/insight. This is were the power of the zettelkasten lies.

I've been using Logseq for some time but find the interface too sluggish. I found "ekg" emacs plugin but it's missing a few features to replace Logseq. I would like for all my notes to be combined into a single graph where they can be directly edited/manipulated without having to open up another buffer. Any other plugins aside from ekg that would give me a Logseq-like experience? (no org-mode, no note titles) Thanks!

 Left-Mouse-Click: The same as Pressing Enter
 Right-Mouse-Click: close current buffer and go to last visible buffer
 ​
 thus you can left click on entry, then go back with right click which is super fast and handy. Try it out !!!
 (I am using evil, but you can easily bind the keys with :
 (define-key dired-mode-map .... )
 code:
 ​
 (defun my/dired-jump (event)
 (interactive "e")
 (mouse-drag-region event)
 (dired-find-file))

 (defun my/dired-jump-close ()

 -- the (-.) is just a flipped (.) ensure :: (Validation v, ValType v ~ a) => Parser a -> v -> Parser a ensure parser validator = (parser >>= validate validator -. maybe (fail $ errMsg validator) pure) `parserCatchError` \path _ -> do let !_ = traceShowId @JSONPath path undefined class Validation v where type ValType v validate :: v -> ValType v -> Maybe (ValType v) errMsg :: v -> String data NotBlank = NotBlank instance Validation NotBlank where type ValType NotBlank = Text validate _ txt = guard (not $ T.null txt) $> txt errMsg _ = "can't be blank" 
 and with basic usage like so:
 newtype Action = Action { body :: Text } deriving (Show) instance FromJSON Action where parseJSON = withObject "Action" $ \v -> Action <$> v .: "body" `ensure` NotBlank 
 which is all fine and dandy but when it does fail from my own manual fail calls, it doesn't pass the JSONPath to the error handler
 λ> eitherDecode @Action "{ \"body\": 3 }" [Key "body"] λ> eitherDecode @Action "{ \"body\": \"\" }" [] -- No path to be seen :( 
 I know I could manually pass in the key/path to the validation types (like v .: "body" 'ensure' NotBlank "body"), but like, that takes extra characters to write, and I don't have the time for that :)
 I've tried looking around but there's basically zero info on this sort of thing. Any suggestions/solutions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 I'm mostly a Java dev who ran into Scala 2 a few years back and now I wanted to try out version 3, just for fun. My IDE of choice is IntelliJ, so I tried to make it work there, but so far, not very successfully.
 The first attempt was "the way I know" - build using Maven and use the IntelliJ Scala plugin for everything. But there was basically no help from the IDE (no autocomplete etc.).
 So I tried doing it "the Scala way" - installed SBT, created a project using the official guide, imported as a BSP project into Intellij using this guide and everything seemed to work - I can run the thing at least :-)
 But when I try to Ctrl+Click something from the standard library (like Seq or max on an Iterable), the IDE navigates to sources of 2.13 instead of 3.3.1. I tried enabling the BSP logs and the classpath SBT is returning is something like
 [ "file:~/IdeaProjects/my_project/target/scala-3.3.1/classes/", "file:~/IdeaProjects/my_project/target/scala-3.3.1/test-classes", "file:~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala3-library_3/3.3.1/scala3-library_3-3.3.1.jar", "file:~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.10/scala-library-2.13.10.jar" ] 
 is it OK that it's sending both Scala 2 and 3 jars? How can I make IntelliJ go to the Scala 3 stdlib on Ctrl+click?
 I'm sure I must be doing a simple msitake somewhere, but I'm out of ideas what to try. I already tried creating a new project from scratch, updating Intellij to the latest version, reinstalling SBT, nothing helps...
 Thanks in advance for any help or pointers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a way to preview the results of a grep search within files as well as fold the output when there are multiple matches in the same file.
 helm-projectile-ag is my current grepping tool but doesn't seem to offer such a facility, unless I haven't read the docs well enough.
 My issues are:
  
It can present a lot of hits in the same file it but lists each one separately. A good option would be to fold the output when there are multiple matches, then I can use the Tab keep to expand the fold and scan through the previews and even edit them right away.
 
The search panel is modal. It doesn't create a result buffer which you can save and then return to later to continue to select files to edit. Once you lose focus it is gone. It doesn't even seem to retain the search term so you can use it later.
 
It would be nice to have a window that shows the actual CLI command passed to the search utility. I see them once in a while but it would be good to show them up front or make them easily accessible.
 
 Do any of the project grep tools or helm-projectile-ag itself offer such features?

Now I am wondering, is there any way to proof that if N >= 0, then S[N] >= 0 in compile-time? I.e. can I derive an instance of S[N] >= 0 =:= true from the instance of N >= 0 =:= true?
 I've tried a naive way to implement this using inline given:  inline given snGeq[N <: Int](using ev: N >= 0 =:= true): (S[N] >= 0 =:= true) = summonInline  however the compiler cannot type check it in case when I try to use this implicit on type level, e.g. ``` import scala.compiletime.ops.int.* import scala.compiletime.*
 inline given snGeq[N <: Int](using ev: N >= 0 =:= true): (S[N] >= 0 =:= true) = summonInline
 sealed trait SizedList[+A, Size <: Int](using Size >= 0 =:= true) case object SNil extends SizedList[Nothing, 0] case class SCons[+A, TailSize <: Int](head: A, tail: SizedList[A, TailSize]) extends SizedList[A, S[TailSize]] ``` does not type check.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using cs-ts-mode, it incorrectly forces me to use paranthesis. For example:
  if (whatever == -1) 
 it won't auto-indent the next line unless I use braces {} with the if statement, even if there is just one statement with a semi-colon after the if. Also, as I'm typing, it weirdly indents my functions as I type them.
 Any way to fix these?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The following code works as I would expect, printing 4:
 do return 4 >>= print 
 However, I was surprised to find that this works just as well:
 do return 4 >>= print 
 Naively, since both lines are at the same indent level, I expected this code to be equivalent to do { return 4; >>= print } which does not typecheck, as expected. 
 Apparently, the correct equivalence is do { return 4 >>= print }. It seems that the two separate lines have been treated as one, despite being at the same indent level in a do block.
 What is the rule that governs this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from new language sources that the community can contribute at any time, this package feels more or less feature complete now.
 v1.0.0 on GitHub
 For those who don't know, treesit-auto enables automatic detection, installation, and usage of tree-sitter grammars and modes in Emacs 29+. Vanilla Emacs exposes some variables and functions that facilitate this behavior, but without treesit-auto it's up to you to check when tree-sitter is available and configure how Emacs behaves when it is (or isn't). This package takes that work away from you and is designed to fit what the vast majority of users would expect from automatic use of tree-sitter in Emacs.
 This started out as just my own configuration to treesit-language-source-alist, major-mode-remap-alist, and auto-mode-alist, but now has a lot of features that didn't exist just under a year ago when I first announced it.
  
Automatic detection and installation for built-in tree-sitter modes, such as rust-ts-mode, yaml-ts-mode, toml-ts-mode, typescript-ts-mode, and go-ts-mode. You can get this behavior through the treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist function (the name is too long...I know)
 Less buggy behavior overall, such as ensuring we switch to the tree-sitter mode after installing it
 Detecting and installing grammars required by the current mode, such as TypeScript and TSX requiring each other
  
This package isn't perfect. It's honestly still a bit of a hack, and many parts of the code are too clever for my own liking. It does its job, though, and I've been a happy, daily user of it for the last 9 months or so. Of course, a big thank you to all who have supported the project and contributed to it along the way!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I sometimes run into this slightly annoying situation when I'm building up a programme, in which I would like to eliminate, add, or swap arguments around in a function definition.
 I'm going to talk about this from the perspective of this simple set of definitions:
 ``` newtype Person = Person { name :: Text } data Lang = EN | FR
 hello :: Lang -> Text hello EN = "hello" hello FR = "salut"
 greet :: Person -> Lang -> Text greet person lang = hello lang <> " " <> name person ```
 Let's take the Helix editor (which I'm playing with as my daily driver). It's annoying because, even if I use the treesitter integration to, say, select the object, delete it, move to the other side of the arrow, and paste it in, I still have to go and write/delete a load of ->. Admittedly, this isn't a big deal, but I remember when I was playing with clojure many years ago in vim, and I sort of loved the ability, via vim-sexp, to move things around -- into lists, out of lists, forward and backwards within a list, etc..
 I was therefore thinking: "I wonder if it's possibly to do this in my editor", and wanted to start with something as simple as "can I move the argument backwards / forwards", by which I mean, with respect to the greet function defined above: "can I swap the Person and Lang arguments so instead of greet myPerson EN I do greet EN myPerson?"
 I thought maybe treesitter would be a nice way to achieve this, but I really have no idea where to start (and if there is a better way). Any ideas?

 I use the heck out of tuedachu/ytdl. One thing I would like to improve about it is that when you queue a download with ytdl-download it appears to be a synchronous call and it freezes emacs until youtube-dl/yt-dlp is able to start the actual download.
 I've yet to dive into the code to see what synchronous function is being called -- I'm very aware of the "single-threaded" nature of Emacs -- but I use other libraries that are likely shelling and they do not hang like this and so I would like to see if there's a way to I can bring whatever technique they are using over to a PR against tuedachu/ytdl.
 Appreciate any advice from the crew here.

 Everything is working fine, but today i decided to install it on my desktop. Im using all the settings from my laptop, but for some reason when i press enter on a link for example, emacs just goes down a line similiar to me pressing the down arrow/j key. This happens on all the links.
 Any idea what the issue could be? This doesnt happen on my laptop
 Edit: Just to clarify, clicking on the link with my mouse works normally.
 Edit 2: Okay so apparently i needed to just do a doom sync since no profile was loaded i think. It said "generating profile" and now it works :) Noob misstake, but ill let this post still be here if anyone runs into the same problem in the future

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a bit off-topic because it's not necessarily using Haskell but it's connected enough that I hope it's ok that I post here.
 I'd like to write proofs about category theory, and I'd like to mechanize them, so that the compiler/type checker will check the proofs for me. Think, for example, of writing the proofs for the usual exercises you find in category theory books (e.g., from Benjamin Pierce's book, page 35, "Show that in any Cartesian closed category, B{AxA'} is isomorphic to (BA )A'", or page 41, "Show that if an F-algebra (F a) is initial in the category F-Alg [defined before] then a is an isomorphism").
 What would be good languages to write such proofs? Idris? Lean? Agda?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a number of edits I need to do to yaml files. I'd like to drive emacs in the following way: mapcar over a list calling a function that opens a file, searches for a match, switches to interactive mode so I can adjust point, inserts some pre-formatted data specific to the match, allows me to edit the insertion to fix the inevitable typos that exist and, when I'm ready, saves the file and moves to the next element. I'm automating the file and buffer navigation as well as the content insertion but doing precise placement and editing by hand. Sadly, I did this once previously years ago but I don't remember how.
 Relevant rant: this stupidity's only necessary because yaml's flexibility for too many ways to do the same thing so reading the yaml in, adjusting the data structures and writing it back out make pull requests horrific as minute semantic changes can have massive syntactic ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i'm pretty sure i'm overthinking this but why does doom emacs have
 SPC-c c for compiling
 and SPC-c C for recompiling
 i thought it should've been other way round as i generally put the command for compiling and then just keep recompiling repeatedly and i believe doing SPC-c c is faster than pressing SPC-c C
 ​
 when so you either have four keys to press by doing SPC-c c <CR> to recompile
 or you have to press four keys by doing SPC-c <shift>c assuming you press shift for C
 what i prefer doing is using SPC-c c for recompiling only three keys to press 
 and SPC-c <shift>c for compiling normally
 ​
 it's just a little thing annoying me whenever i go from one config of doom emacs to another
 every person i've seen doesn't reconfigure this. but they do seem to be bothered by this they do realize how annoying it is but don't want to go through the hassle to remap that
 ​
 what do you guys think am i too paranoid about this is my OCD kicking in or do you feel the same ?

 I've also learnt they are actively hiring (Bloomberg in general) but at least for entry level positions there is a team matching where you can find a team that uses Haskell in production.
 Thought it might be interesting to some other Haskell fans in search of jobs! :)

 I use org-attach a lot in my notes. And I also have a default temp folder on my disk where everything I collect lands in (created automatically by emacs at startup, using the date as variable for its name).
 When I try to attach a file using org-attach, the default folder shown is the root of my note folder, it varies according to the notes.
 What can I do to have my default temp directory (created using '(make-directory mydailytempdir)' ) to be the first goal shown when opening an 'org-attach' process looking for new attachments?
 I tried to look into the elisp file 'org-attach.el', but my elisp-fu is not good enough...
 I guess using embark could help, but it would add many keypresses... I'd like to avoid it.
 is there a way to have a selection of path to choose from when opening org-attach (that could be defined in the init.el)??

When I first open an org file this changes to (rmail-after-save-hook) despite not using rmail. This is normal though based on this answer from Eli. In other org buffers the (buffer local) value is (diff-hl-update t) whether under version control or not as global-diff-mode is enabled. For python files the (buffer local) value is (diff-hl-update t ws-butler-after-save) as ws-butler-mode is enabled in the prog-mode-hook. What am I missing that could cause this behaviour? It is occurring irrespective of the buffer and only if there are changes to be saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say I'm using Shardcake 2.1.1 which has a dependency on Caliban 2.4.0, which has zio-http 3.0.0-RC2 as a dependency.
 In the same app I want to also use zio-http 3.0.0-RC3 directly for an API, and want that version specifically because it has some features I really want (namely the new routes DSL). It's compiling just fine, but I'm getting run time errors:
 java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: no further information: localhost/[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]:8087 
 Is there a way to handle this without having to fork and/or compile my own versions of Shardcake and Caliban locally until a release or snapshot is made with zio-http-RC3 (or some other future version that has the features I want)? I think I remember having a similar issue in the past because I wanted to use tapir with Caliban and each had a dependency on a different version of zio-http... I got it to compile and then run by breaking up the project into several sub-projects making sure there were no overlaps in dependencies, but this was kind of unwieldy considering it was a fairly small project, so I'd rather not do that again.
 Do correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've read this isn't an Scala-only thing and also affects Java, so I'm wondering if there's a commonly known workaround for this that I don't know of (maybe some eviction policies in the sbt file, or in Java's case pom file?).

 I wish to abstract away from all MATLAB code writing by creating a code generator in Haskell. I am curious if you know of any projects that deal with similar problems I could use for inspiration. For now, I have a scope for the problem:
 The generator should be able to produce algorithms dealing with arrays and linear algebraic objects. Combining the right types from the vector-space and linear libraries, it should be possible to
  
operate on types like SquareMatrix, which get translated to an if condition with error on the start of the MATLAB function- evaluate linear functions, operators, maps and folds as imperative code from some basic building blocks.
 These computations will likely be in their own possibly monadic type and it should be possible to evaluate actions into either MATLAB code or direct execution as if it were a (almost) pure haskell function.
 Actions can be used to define MATLAB functions. Code generated from computations using a defined function should not repeat code, but generate the correct call instead

 I've used Emacs off and on for many years at this point. Throughout that time there have been periods where I really leaned in to it and tried to use it for everything, and there have been periods where I only used it for org and/or magit, etc. I've learned lots of things about it and I've forgotten lots of things about it, but I've never been what I would call an "expert" or even a "power user". So, when I feel like something isn't working well in Emacs, I almost always default to the assumption that I'm doing something wrong or misunderstanding something, etc. 
 So, it very well may be that I'm wrong/crazy in my recent conclusion that use-package might not be the ideal abstraction for managing Emacs packages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning,
 I recently have become enamored of Typst for document creation. It's fast, it's approachable, it's cross platform, and it's extremely capable even in preview beta. I never really got the swing of LaTeX with all the backslash/curlybrace mayhem. 
 In any event, I find myself actually working on a long technical document in Typst in Emacs. There does exist typst-ts-mode so thanks tree-sitter and all those people who manage the grammar libraries for it. However I'm finding myself in need of a better way of navigating the huge document to get to sections I want to do.
 I looked into the baked-in bookmarks and I could probably use that capability, though I was hoping for more of an customizeable outline mode. Manually setting the bookmarks for an entire document seems tedious. I mainly just want to navigate by headings and that would be sufficient.
 What do people use for this sort of thing (possibly in the LaTeX world?) Just bookmarks with some sort of automated way of populating the bookmarks? I did check the typst-ts-mode and while there are some functions there for compiling, there don't seem to be any functions for navigating by semantic structures. Perhaps that's baked into tree-sitter itself?
 Anyhow, any help greatly appreciated here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/emacs,
 I'm excited to share my new package with you that I've been working on - EMT (Emacs MacOS Tokenizer).
 EMT leverages macOS's built-in NLP tokenizer by dynamic module to tokenize and handle CJK words in Emacs. It also introduces a minor mode (emt-mode) that remaps functions forward-word, backward-word, mark-word, kill-word, and backward-kill-word to their CJK compatible versions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So after my struggles getting this setup going I'm really enjoying this setup.
 Thought I'd post here as there is quite a bit of intersectionality between the emacs, Arch, Steamdeck, Nix and Mechboards communities.
 Spec as follows:
  
Steamdeck (LCD);
 SteamOS 3.5 Preview (Arch based and compatible with Nix packages);
 Emacs 29 (via Nix package);
 DooM config + some tweaks of my own; and
 Corne Light v2 with random DSA caps.
  
Ambitions for this setup are:
  
Better emacs-fu (thanks to everyone here with their help so far);
 RGB underglow on the keyboard for 90s vibes;
 Printed keycaps in jazzy colours;
 Better keymap (maybe Miryoku or something with homerow mods)

 I was thinking how we can solve the ctrl+c "problem", I found that the ctrl+c with cua-mode is working as copy when a region is selected and it is working az prefix when there is no region selected.
 I would like to ask that is possible to change the ctrl+c in the "c" codebase easily or I don't know where ?
 It can be a patch and create a custom build to myself ...
 Or I just live with it and there is no way to put this "user prefix" to an other key combination ?
 thanks for the answers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The context here is, I'm working in a company environment that is using https://trunk.io in its dev environment, which is kind of a meta-linter for many languages. It wraps a bunch of backend lint tools and combines their results, and enforces a company wide policy on all of them. They provide integrations for a few IDEs, but nothing specific to emacs yet. What they do provide is an LSP proxy to their tool. I have been looking if there is any support in flymake or flycheck to use a generic LSP server as the checker backend, and I haven't found anything. Does anyone know if this is possible? Or if there's an existing backend that's close enough that could be tweaked to do this? I've attempted to duplicate the trunk configuration using individual flymake backends, and the maintenance is just too much. It would be way easier to just make use of the tool directly.

 I just had the problem again. I made sure the edits are very far away, many lines in the same org-buffer. Neither goto-last-change-reverse nor goto-last-change does find them. But when I use undo-redo, all my "forgotten" edits are found and subsequently undone. How can that be?
 Do you use a different function for going back to the last edits? Or am I using goto-last-change in a wrong way? The variable glc-default-span is set to 8, and I am using Org mode version 9.6.9 and Emacs 29.1. Thank you for any advice!
 Edit: I also use undo-fu-session, could it be that this interferes with goto-last-change?

 What is less well-known is that Applicative is a similar monoid with a different tensor.
 Monad = MonoidalOf (~>) Identity Compose Applicative = MonoidalOf (~>) Identity Day 
 These are explained in "Notions of Computation as Monoids": https://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/~mauro/pubs/Notions_of_Computation_as_Monoids.pdf.
 Here is a compilation I have made of other monoid typeclasses, I haven't seen a more complete list elsewhere. I put the focus on structuring them clearly to elucidate the pattern.

 (global-set-key (kbd "C-q") 'cmd) (global-set-key (kbd "C-Q" | "C-S-q" | "C-S-Q" | "C-\S-q" | "C-\S-Q" | ...) 'cmd-2) 
 and swapping the lines.
 I never manage to get the intended behaviour – it keeps translating the uppercase to lowercase or vice-versa. And sometimes it doesn't – there seems to be no pattern.
 Could someone help me out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried looking at org-ql and found it to be a little overcomplicated for my more limited use cases.
 I felt like something simpler should exist, so I'm thinking of creating a mini query language that can be used to reference specific notes.
 Some examples:
 mynotes.org/0 -- grab first note in mynotes.org, a file in the current directory.
 /0/0 - grab first note of the first note of the current file.
 ../sibling note -- subnote of parent of current note with title "sibling note".
 /0/0/1 -- relative to current file, 2nd note of the first subnote of the first subnote.
 ./0/1 -- 2nd subnote of the first subnote relative to current note.
 ../0/0 -- 1st subnote of the first subnote relative to the 
 The query function would have "find one" and "find all" functions. find one would fail if there were 0 or 2+ results.
 This query language would be focused around the following needs:
  
Ability to straightforwardly pass a reference to a note from one command line app that reads org mode to another.
 Ability to programmatically reference one note from another by relative or absolute location. There are some command line applications I'd like to build around org mode which would need something like this.
 Simplicity. I could add all sorts of bells and whistles to this but it would overburden it.
  
The other idea I had was to just use xpath but apply it to org mode. xpath is well known but I think it's not so well liked, and the above queries would be possible but a lot more gnarly.
 Does this seem like a good idea? Bad idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just in case someone else also stumbles over this: Somewhere between 27.1 and 29.1, the behavior of format-spec has changed, when the substitution is a symbol.
 Prior to upgrading to from 27.1 to 29.1, invocations
 (format-spec "Hello %a!" '((a . world))) 
 would evaluate to the string
 "Hello world!" 
 As of 29.1, the behavior depends on whether a function is bound to world: If no function is bound to world', the same result as in 27.1 will be obtained, but if a function is bound toworld', it will be invoked without arguments, and the return value will be used instead of the symbol name.
 This has bitten me in my `.emacs', where I had code using 
 (format-spec "[...] `%s-p' [...]" `(... (?s . ,type-name) ...)) 
 to generate a doc-string, and got an unexpected error
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (1 . 1) 0) 
 upon start-up, due to a function some-type-p being called without arguments under the new behavior, instead of interpolating it as symbol-name.
 Order of execution
 This was especially confusing, due to the introduction of a dependence on the order of execution. E.g. create a file /tmp/test.el with contents 
 ;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*- (format-spec "Hello %s!" '((?s . foo-p))) (defun foo-p (obj) t) (princ "Done.\n") 
 then 
 >>> emacs --batch --load /tmp/test.el Done. 
 but
 >>> emacs --batch --load /tmp/test.el --load /tmp/test.el Wrong number of arguments: ((t) (obj) t), 0 Done. Error: wrong-number-of-arguments (((t) (obj) t) 0) mapbacktrace(#f(compiled-function (evald func args flags) #<bytecode 0x19e0e4c019aef0c7>)) debug-early-backtrace() debug-early(error (wrong-number-of-arguments ((t) (obj) t) 0)) foo-p() format-spec("Hello %s!" ((115 . foo-p))) eval-buffer(#<buffer *load*> nil "/tmp/test.el" nil t) load-with-code-conversion("/tmp/test.el" "/tmp/test.el" nil t) load("/tmp/test.el" nil t) command-line-1(("--load" "/tmp/test.el" "--load" "/tmp/test.el")) command-line() normal-top-level()

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using optparse-applicative I'm trying construct a parser that collects everything after the first argument into a list of strings. My goal is to write a tool that wraps another tool, adding a few commands and passing all unknown commands on.
 I'd hoped to find that strArgument would take anything and turn it into a string, i.e. that something like this would work:
 ``` main :: IO () main = do execParser optParser >>= print
 data Opts = OptFoo String [String] deriving (Show)
 optParser = info (fall <*> helper) fullDesc where fall = OptFoo <$> strArgument (metavar "CMD" <> help "git command") <> many (strArgument mempty) ```
 It works nicely for ordinary arguments:
  ❯ cabal exec test -- baz silly OptFoo "baz" ["silly"] 
 but it doesn't work with options
 `` ❯ cabal exec test -- baz silly foo --bar Invalid option--bar'
 Usage: optparse-applicative-tst CMD ```
 and it also picks up --help
 ``` ❯ cabal exec test -- baz silly --help Usage: optparse-applicative-tst CMD
 Available options: CMD git command -h,--help Show this help text ```
 I suspect optparse-applicative simply wasn't written with this use case in mind and I'm failing to see any way of writing such a parser. Is there a way to do this using optparse-applicative, or should I look at other option/argument parsing packages?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr - see Question below
 Background / my setup
 So I've used a GTD-like setup in org-mode for a few years now. I'm very much still a noob.
 One thing I feel is slowing me down, particularly at weekly reveiw, is needing to duplicate project headings for tasks (or maybe I'm making a fundamental mistake in my workflow).
 For example, I'd write something like the below and need to type "Big/Small Important Work Project" a number of times with my big fat fingers:
 ``` ** Big Important Work Project
 *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Big Important Work Project :computer:
 *** TODO: book room on 5th floor for meeting about Big Important Work Project
 ** Small Important Work Project
 *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Small Important Work Project :computer:
 *** TODO: book room on 4th floor for meeting about Small Important Work Project
 ``` (Note, I don't actually use TODO keywords, except DONE)
 In org mode I can simply use folding to see what project the task is for, however, my reminders are either in Orgzly (agenda widget), or via tasker popups on my phone 
 I therefore get tasks like "call amit" or "book room" a lot, devoid of context.
 Question:
 Is there a way the a project (X-level) heading can be inherited by its children? Maybe appended to them?
 I realise this is not nessecarily an Org, or emacs, problem but I hope I can solve it programatically in emacs.

 Erules is a lightweight, simple, and functional Scala library for rule evaluation. In this article, we will explore how to use this library to define and evaluate rules efficiently. Follow step-by-step for a detailed and hands-on understanding of use cases.
 What is Erules?
 Erules is a library that provides a rule evaluation engine in Scala. It is designed to be straightforward, typed, and functional, leveraging the power of Cats core. With Erules, you can define rules clearly and evaluate them on various data types concisely.
 Step 1: Import the Library
 To get started, add Erules as a dependency to your Scala project. You can do this in the build.sbt file with the following declaration:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there some way to make visual-line-mode more smart about line-breaks? As depicted in fig.1, visual-line-mode doesn't really handle overly-long lines (e.g. due to URLs) well. Disabling it entirely makes a bad overall trade-off in files containing mostly textual lines (fig.2).
 It could improve by allowing line-breaks on some non-whitespace characters (like "-" or "/") or simply disabling visual-line-mode entirely for "words" that anyway need more than one line. Better yet, for any word exceeding a maximum character-length (e.g. 50) in order to better handle lines containing a few words, but also a moderately long URL (e.g. when using the markdown syntax [link name](link url)).
 I've found no existing options in the M-x customize interface, nor any relevant packages in M-x package-list-packages (including MELPA).
 Fig.1 When breaking long \"words\" like URLs, visual-line-mode is not very smart about where to break the lines.
 Fig.2 For URLs, having no visual-line-mode line breaks active would be preferable, but the disadvantage of disabling visual-line-mode for lines with actual text is too big to just disable visual-line-mode entirely.

 haskell foo :: String -> Int -> State Int () foo global local | local >= 10 = put 100 | otherwise = do if (ord local) `elem` global then do put (local) foo global (local + 1) else do return () 
 Note: This program means absolutely nothing. This is a very basic structure of a program I am working on. As you see that the first parameter is a read-only global variable which I wish to abstract out in a Reader monad. I know I have to work with StateT.
  newType State s m a = State { runStateT :: (s -> m (s, a)) } -- where m is the inner monad 
 My understanding is that I should change my function signature to:
  foo :: Int -> StateT Int (Reader String ()) foo = undefined -- I don't know how to implement this

I.e., I want to use a monospace font for all strings of the form \(...\) or \[...\], where ... may include newline characters as well, as is common for equations written in math display mode. 
 I'm an Emacs newb, so the best I could come up with was a regex-based font-lock:
 (progn (setq-local font-lock-keywords `((,(rx (group (or "\\[" "\\(") (zero-or-more anything) (or "\\]" "\\)"))) (1 'fixed-pitch)))) (font-lock-fontify-buffer)) 
 And then running this on an org-mode-hook.
 But this is definitely wrong. Not only does it remove all the nice org-mode styling applied to things like section headers, but it's also applying the fixed-pitch font to more than just the intended math fragments, suggesting issues with the regex at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there some package in Emacs, that works as a web server, that can be used for testing the project, that you are currently working on?
 For example, I have a project folder, that's currently opened in Emacs with html, css and js files is there a package, that will run a web server on the project's working path.
 I mean, it's possible to just open files on the web browser, but, there are situations in HTML5, that are prohibited without using web server, i.e. AJAX and WebSocket and some other technologies. Also, if you use local version (not the web server), you cannot use absolute paths to files in the project, because they will differ from those on the web server.
