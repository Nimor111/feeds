        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty new here to the singleton library and currently trying to refactor some code that I previously hacked together using Data.Dynamic. To keep the problem as simple as possible, I've boiled down my application to the following (nonsensical) example:
  data Foo = A | B deriving (Eq, Ord) genSingletons [''Foo] class MyConstraint (t :: k) instance MyConstraint 'A instance MyConstraint 'B f :: forall k . (forall (t :: k) . MyConstraint t) => () f = () v = f @Foo -- this does not work, even though forall (t: Foo) . MyConstraint t 
 Basically, I have some function f which for a given kind k (or at least a given list of types of kind k) needs to know that all types belonging to that kind (or in that list) satisfy some constraint. Conveniently, I can express this using QuantifiedConstraints, and make properly make use of that constraint in the function's body. The problem is that I never seem to be able to call that function in a way that it satisfies this quantified constraint, and I don't know how to tell Haskell that it does actually satisfy this constraint forall t :: Foo in this case. Any ideas/suggestions?

 I run ibus with `ibus-daemon -dxr --verbose`, it show that ibus don't capure keypress in emacs windows anymore even when it is new frame, only in new emacs process windows, I could type chineses or japaneses.
 The other apps like chrome, xterm, neovim ... work as normal, the logs in verbose mode show keypress as normal, it seems like ibus hates emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya! 
 I would like to share with you all a little package package I've written here https://github.com/JasZhe/window-stool for code context. 
 There's a few similar packages out there like lsp/eglot breadcrumbs, treesitter-context, and topsy to name a few but most of them use header-line (or in the case of treesitter-context, a childframe) which is limited to a single line.
 I really liked how context.vim had a sort of "cascading" context style and I didn't find anything similar to it so I figured I'd give it my own shot here. 
 To achieve that, this package uses overlays and so it may not be as performant as others, but I haven't experienced too much slowness personally, even on a pretty old 2017 Macbook. 
 It basically constantly moves an overlay to be at the top of the window to act like a pseudo multi-line header-line. I also opted to use a simple indentation based heuristic for figuring out the context as a default. There's customization options to specify different kinds of context functions depending on the major mode. I've included a simple one for org-mode using headings. 
 In the future, I might try to add some tree-sitter support when I get a chance to dig into it.
 I named it window-stool cause it acts like a little stool that you can use to glimpse the contents above what your window can normally see.
 I've been using it for a little while, ironing out kinks along the way so hopefully there aren't too many issues with others using it, but I'd appreciate any feedback for problems that crop up. Thanks emacs community!

 Scala can be an advanced version of Java. It is more expressive. You can write neat code. All this comes with an acceptable learning curve. Valid choice.
 If you use Scala+Cats, it means you want to do advanced FP. Then why not just use Haskell? Instead of using a tool to turn stones into gold, you can just pick gold...
 And Cats can't make pure gold for you, because there is no linting tool in Scala to enforce the purity. Your teammate can still write functions that have side effects. A mix of pure + impure code is confusing and error-prone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-mode for keeping notes, and have used it to plan projects I led in the past. Now I am managing a team of people, each of whom have their own projects, I am struggling to scale it to this task. I use org-journal to keep notes from meetings, org-capture to add my individual todos. I try and tag the meetings with the relevant projects, but meetings are with people, and sometimes people work on different projects. I have been tagging meetings/todos with people's names, but recently tried org-secretary to add their names as properties, which seems a nicer idea (cleaner, more organised) but also seems less searchable than tags. 
 I would really like to get
 1. an individual overview, that called up for each person the most recent meeting notes and any todos with their name as a tag or property, and then
 2. an overview of overviews so I can scan through - when did we last meet, any outstanding TODOs (for me) or TASKs (for them), and then dip into the individual overview for each. 
 Ideally I could do this by project too (which would just be another tag), but the people view seems most urgent. 
 Are there any suggestions how I could go about this?

Using the native Wayland Linux App (pgtk build), it is possible to restore the lost window, sometimes, by clicking on the Emacsclient icon but often you just have to kill Emacs which sucks when you have Python/Julia/R REPLs or other buffers open that you want to continue working on.

 If I have this in my init.el:
 ``` (require 'package)
 (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
 (load-theme 'manoj-dark)
 ```
 then performing this:
  M-: (getenv "TERM") 
 or this:
  C-x d 
 crashes emacs
 Commenting out the top two lines, or the last line allows the getenv command to work.
 Any ideas?
 EDIT:
 Visiting any file before I perform the getenv allows it to complete successfully The graphical emacs works fine, only when I lauch with -nw does it exhibit this behaviour.

 I am a new Emacs user. What is driving me to do this is that Emacs is sometimes crashing or closing unexpectedly and I would like to know the reason why this happens so I can prevent it.
 I have tried Googling this question, searching in Reddit and the Emacs documentation, and using Chatgpt to no avail. I am clearly missing where this information is, so any help is most appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I recently have started learning emacs. I did the built-in tutorial and followed a couple of SystemCrafters’s “Emacs From Scratch” videos, and I’m facing a dilemma right now.
 Of course, evil-mode is hugely popular and has a lot of support, often being called the best vim emulator. Even SystemCrafters uses it, which to me, is a big vouch for using it.
 However, in reading some other reddit posts about others asking this same question, many people said that it had compatibility issues with some plugins, and relying on vim emulators has always left a bad taste in my mouth from other editors. Also, as a new emacs user, I don’t know how much of the emacs experience changes with evil-mode, and I don’t have the knowledge to be able to thoroughly understand and debug any issues that might come up from using it.
 So, I’m mostly just looking for some affirmation and anecdotes, good and bad, about evil-mode: if it will hurt me as a new user, and generally any heads-ups that could help me. Thank you!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 The Haskell Foundation Technical Working Group (TWG)  serves as an advisory organization for both the HF management and the Haskell community as a whole, by evaluating specific proposals for projects that can have broad, ecosystem-wide effects. These proposals can be:
  
Community RFCs that seek the community’s input on a project
 Community projects that will be executed primarily by the proposer, but seek administrative or financial support from the HF
 HF projects that a community member would like us to execute
 Other topics of relevance to the community
  
Volunteers wanted!
 We presently have three openings on the working group, and we’re seeking volunteers. Members are expected to attend a monthly meeting, to participate in and moderate discussion threads regarding specific proposals, and to evaluate proposals for their technical merits. From time to time, committee members may also be asked to help a community member revise their proposal. The ability to communicate well and respectfully is important for any potential member.
 These discussions have a real impact on the Haskell ecosystem, so this is an opportunity to give back in a meaningful way.
 If you are interested, or if you know someone who might be, please get in touch with me at director@haskell.foundation! You don’t have to be a long-term Haskeller, or someone who is deeply embedded in Haskell development - we have members with this background already. If you are unsure as to whether you would fit in, please get in touch, and we can have a chat about it. We would like to have members with diverse backgrounds, professional experiences, and knowledge. All self-nominations must be submitted by the end of the day on Jan 12th 2024.

The problem that I have is that, for whatever strange reason, this code triggers a compiler warning: [E029] Pattern Match Exhaustivity Warning for a specific case class.
 I've done some research into compiler options but the options related to macros have been removed in scala 3. See: https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/migration/options-lookup.html and search for -Ymacros.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I suppose the solution to my problem must be fairly easy, but I've only recently started using Emacs for both coding and org mode, and I need some help with my config file.\
 Basically, I have a ".emacs" file that I started configuring through tutorials about a month ago. At the time, all I did was assemble together different elisp snippets from different configurations that I found online and liked. Inevitably, I accidentally created a kind of Frankenstein. My main problem is that I have contradictory information in (custom-set-faces) and (custom-theme-set-faces). Now, when I try to change something, it starts accumulating contradictory information and randomly selecting which one to pick.
 I want to clean up my config file, possibly try literate configuration. The problem is that I fear losing all my current configuration and being left with nothing, having to restart from scratch. Can anybody lend me a hand or share some resources?
 Here's my configuration, if you'd like to take a look. Thanks a lot.

 This does not work, the cursor color is not yellow when Emacs starts. If I evaluate this piece of code after startup, the cursor will shift to yellow. I suspect this is caused by set-cursor-color setting the cursor color for the selected frame, only.
 The documentation for set-cursor-color says;
 You can also set the text cursor color, for all frames, by customizing the cursor face. 
 I have tried to figure out how to do this, without success. How do I change the cursor color for all frames?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm really excited about this idea of how you can maintain referential transparency and still perform real mutations/effects without having to force something into a monad that you can't "break out" of.
 In Clean, as in any language, monads are possible, but you are not dependent on them and can get the value back at any time, so the complex combination of different types of monads is unnecessary. Monads in Clean are therefore just a helpful tool to facilitate sequences of computations. In Haskell, however, monads like IO seem a bit hacky with their lots of magic in the background, where only the compiler developers themselves probably know how they actually work. This magic has always irritated me and distorted the idea of monads.
 This brings to mind the idea of creating a resource like a file completely referentially transparent as a mere program object, and manipulating it, just as you can do with numbers or other simple values, without actually causing anything outside of the programming. You're just describing the transformations. And only when you actually want to perform all these operations in the real world you add “*World” and continue working with an unique object standing for an entity in the real world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 As described in the title, I have problems with table alignment in my org files, as you can see in the following example:
 | 1 | 22 | 333 | 4444 | 55555 | 666666 | 7777777 |
 |------+------+------+------+-------+--------+---------|
 | Data | | | | | | |
 | | Data | | | | | |
 | | | Data | | | | |
 | | | | Data | | | |
 | | | | | Data | | |
 | | | | | | Data | |
 ​
 These are my related settings in ~/.emacs
 ;; Normal text fonts. Both variable and fixed pitch
 (custom-theme-set-faces
 'user
 '(variable-pitch ((t (:family "ETBembo" :height 130 :weight thin))))
 '(fixed-pitch ((t ( :family "Fira Code Retina" :height 130))))
 '(org-block ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))))
 '(org-code ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
 '(org-document-info ((t (:foreground "dark orange"))))
 '(org-document-info-keyword ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
 '(org-indent ((t (:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch)))))
 '(org-link ((t (:foreground "royal blue" :underline t))))
 '(org-meta-line ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)))))
 '(org-property-value ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))) t)
 '(org-special-keyword ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)))))
 '(org-table ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch :foreground "#83a598"))))
 '(org-tag ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch) :weight bold :height 0.8))))
 '(org-verbatim ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch))))))
 ​
 ;;Trying to fix tables
 (set-face-attribute 'org-table nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch)
 ​
 ;; Set variable pitch as normal
 (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'variable-pitch-mode)
 ​
 ;; Make me select paragraph size myself
 (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode)
 ​
 I tried changing many different settings, but have seen no improvement yet. Even if I force fixed-pitch with M-x, the tables still won't align properly. Could someone help me figure out what I'm doing wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
I've been getting around the Zettelkasten method for about 2 years, but never dove in.
I've tried several formats.
I've tried a file per each note and numbering it, such as 1.a, 1.a1, 2.a, and so on, but soon all the notes appeared the same to me, and I found hard to detect the paths of the notes
So I've tried a single outline (see the screenshot) because I'm a visual person, hoping to have a visual clue of the structure of the chains of thoughts, but again I feel confused when I see all of those lines.
Furthermore, I need a fast way to insert the new note into the System, because I have no time to get the extra hour each day in order to review the notes (I'm always on the rush).
I also tried a kind of PARA method, thinking of the opportunistic strategy, but I fear I'll have difficulties when searching for older notes.
Any advice is accepted.
PS: a screenshot of the outline...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! Haskell noob here. I don't know the right terms here so please bear with me if I misuse any terms. Thanks! 
 I am looking for an async programming model like boost asio (the proactor design pattern) in haskell. I am not sure how to articulate it for a web search but essentially what I am looking for is to translate a toy asio server in C++ with callbacks to haskell. 
 I can (and did) implement this using forkIO + Chan but I am curious if the following has a name in haskell.
 type Context mkSocket :: Context -> IO Socket recvData :: Socket -> (Buffer -> IO a) -> IO () runContextFor :: Duration -> Context -> IO () 
 Here, each Context should be able to manage its own event backend (epoll, select, IOCP) without depending on the haskell runtime. Ideally, I should be able to run the event loop every once in a while manually. Am I going in the right direction here?
 In spirit of the X-Y problem, what I am trying to solve is a reader on a socket forkIO $ forever (recvFrom sock 512 >>= doSth) should be interruptible and I should be able to interrupt this "blocking" wait on the thread. I guess I can do the following but they don't feel clean
  
by closing the socket and forcing an exception on all readers
 set a socket receive timeout and exit the "blocking" wait periodically
 use a System.Timeout.timeout on a read and poll

 However, mtl doesn't have a MaybeT. It seems there's MonadState instead, but there's no documentation on how to actually use it. In fact, I've searched far and wide, and all I see are articles like "let's make our own instance of MonadState" or "define MonadState from scratch" followed by some fictitious code. After an hour, I feel like punching in their faces and screaming, "FFS don't reinvent the wheel, show me a real example instead".
 Sorry for the rant, but libraries like mtl and articles like the above are cancer for the Haskell community. The only silver living are the good people in the community, that's who I've turned to for help.

 This may or may not emit a conflict issue on Syncthing side, which does not goes into the details of wheter the edited parts of the document are disjointed or not. So the question: do you use another synchronization technique that is more reliable regarding this aspect?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a non-programmer who uses emacs for writing (a dissertation) and research. Originally I was writing in LaTeX, now I write in org mode.
 I've found org mode to be a great tool for writing but I'm pretty new to it. I'm curious how other writers incorporate the task functionality of org mode into the writing process.
 So far, I've kept things separate. So I have my document I'm writing in (say a chapter) and I have a separate outline in a different document that I add my TODO tags to (see image).
 However, with this method, if I make changes to the writing document outline (which happens a lot), I have to update my tasks document. Is there a way to have the TODO tags in my writing document and be able to see those headlines in a separate buffer?
 Or is the another way you use TODO tags to keep track of writing tasks?
 All advice is welcome.
 ETA: I should also say that I use narrow/widen quite a bit, which I can do with a separate tasks file. Would be interested if other methods can similarly narrow in.

This is captured in my ZK, in a purposeful way but with random timing.  Each zettel covers one thought or memory and is written following the normal process for producing a pithy, well-considered note.  So far, I have written 35 such zettels covering a variety of topics and all organized (yes, I admit it) using a structure note.
I have let random memories trigger the note writing, which probably explains why the overall process has been, well, random.  Recently, I’ve been thinking I’d like some more discipline and consistency in the process.  You know the saying - be careful what you wish for!

I followed the instructions and verified that my emacs is compiled with tree-sitter flag (I downloaded emacs binary from fedroa repos). I have libtree-sitter and libtree-sitter-devel installed from system package manager. Following is my configuration of tree-sitter
 (use-package treesit :ensure nil :custom (treesit-language-source-alist '((c++ "https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-cpp") (python "https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python") (c "https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c"))) (major-mode-remap-alist '((c++-mode . c++-ts-mode) (python-mode . python-ts-mode) (c-mode . c-ts-mode))) (treesit-font-lock-level 4)) 
 Though I cannot pin point exactly what I did but for some reason while before I simply got a nil for 
 (treesit-language-available-p 'c++) 
 but now I am getting this for some reason 
 *** Eval error *** Wrong type argument: stringp, nil 
 What is even more confusing that c-ts-mode and python-ts-mode are working fine. 
 Here are my contents of ~/.config/emacs/tree-sitter
 . ├── libtree-sitter-c++.so ├── libtree-sitter-c.so └── libtree-sitter-python.so 
 Any help would be appreciated : )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past decade, pixel density of displays has increased significantly. On Mac, the "Retina" display concept represents a doubling of display density, from ~100 to ~200ppi. On HDPI Retina displays, applications are presented with and work in "virtual" pixels of 2x2 physical screen pixels, so that font sizes, icons, etc. remain "normal". Then raster, vector and font drawing can make use of all the tiny pixels, for higher quality. My question is, how does Emacs on different systems handle HDPI display?
 My build (emacs-mac) provides some limited support for varying DPI. You can provide parallel high-res versions of image files named like file@2x.ext which are substituted for low-DPI images (without the @2x) automatically. You can similarly embed the text property :data-2x in generated image data. But standalone high density images (like Retina screenshots) must be scaled appropriately (often by 0.5x) to "light all the pixels" and not appear overly large.
 What do other ports do to accommodate high-DPI? Nothing? Do you just select very large font sizes? What if you have multiple displays with significantly different pixel density connected? How is image display handled? This seems like an area where some coherent treatment and documentation would be very helpful. But perhaps the underlying OS/display systems vary so greatly in their treatment of HDPI it limits this kind of progress?

 This is my first Reddit post so please let me know if I’ve done anything wrong. 
 I started with no experience in software developing a few years ago into a Scala environment so Scala is all I know. 
 I would say I am at a middle level point and trying to further my knowledge but I am struggling on making my learning efficient as I seem to go round and round reusing the same solutions. 
 Somebody who started with me went through Rock the JVM and he said it was the best thing he done. I’m thinking of starting that. 
 Has anybody got suggestions or recommendations on how to learn new things more effectively? 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi everyone
 I want org-ellipsis to display the number of subheadings.
 that's because of two reasons.
  
I want to add meaning to the decorations. 
 I want to get some information of big picture even if it's folded.
  
It's something like this: 
 * test (23)
 * testtest (3)
 I think you can understand the big picture of the file faster if you have numbers...
 (I think it's useful to display some information individually, even if not just numbers.)
 ​
 So, I tried to implement this.
 I thought of assigning a unique value to ellipsis for individual lines by assigning a conditional value to org-ellipsis.
 but I couldn't figure out the conditions to identify the ellipsis displayed on individual lines...
 and I read some code related to org-ellipsis, but I couldn't figure out the mechanism to specifically display org-ellipsis.
 (All I found out was that the ellipsis value was stored in something like some archetype when collapsing headings...)
 ​
 if anyone has any hints please let me know !
 Also let me know your thought on the idea of adding information to org-ellipsis. 
 Apologize for my bad English and stupid attempt. thank you for long reading!

Some information about me: I have graduated in computer science and used to work one and a half years as a junior developer. At the moment I'm travelling through different countries, but I would love to also learn something related to development. Because I will continue my traveling and it's more about learning something new (Haskell and functional programming), I'm not looking for a long term position, but more an internship. I'm happy to hear from you guys if you are interested. Greetings Micha😊

When I debug Rust code I don't get syntax highlighting under certain inactive code (specifically when statements like #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] appear). I tried adding a line to my .cargo/config to enable these features features but rust-analyzer doesn't seem to pick it up. I feel like there's a basic option for this, so apologies if I've missed something but I'm rather new to emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I followed the mastering emacs guide to installing tree-sitter but am left a bit confused about what actually these additional major modes are and have some questions.
  
What is the difference between the installing the package tree-sitter and building emacs with tree-sitter? Which one should I use given both options? 
 Do these new ts major modes serve to replace existing modes or do they sit on-top of the regular modes? So If I was using rustic package for rust development, does rust-ts-mode essentially replace the rustic package or would I still need it? 
 How would you tell emacs to use tree-sitter mode if there are no default major modes for the language to begin with? For example rust or go don't have built-in modes like python or bash do so a command like (setq major-mode-remap-alist '((go-mode . go-ts-mode))) would not work unless you explicitly install the go-mode package.

 Or you guys use a pure FP library such as http4s (I guess)? 
 I was thinking that using super mature web frameworks like Springboot + using FP for the service layer makes sense. 
 Hopefully this post doesn't trigger too much the pure FP devs. I'm getting started with FP. I have a Java & Python background. I did some Spark jobs in Scala also.

I want to:
this project, and not another one, or when I'm focused on following a different trail in this project).
I'm curious how you all handle these in your workflow.
Should I drop a zettel with the info in the appropriate place and hope I'll resurface it at the right time? My issue here is that I often don't know what information is going to come out of the article until I've read it.  Should I just take my best guess? (am I just overthinking it)?
Should I keep it on a separate task list or someday/maybe list?  My issue here is that I almost never get to the things on my someday/maybe list because I'm never looking at it when I'm working on a current project, and my task lists quickly get cluttered if they aren't immediately actionable.
Other ideas?  Thanks!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CUDA is a language that, by default is unsupported by treesit in emacs.
 It has a grammar defined in https://github.com/theHamsta/tree-sitter-cuda.
 I have followed https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tree_002dsitter-Major-Modes.html and https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto to come up with the following:
 (use-package treesit-auto :custom (treesit-auto-install t) :config (add-to-list 'treesit-auto-recipe-list (make-treesit-auto-recipe :lang 'cuda :ts-mode 'cuda-ts-mode :url "https://github.com/theHamsta/tree-sitter-cuda" :ext "\\.cu\\'")) (treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist 'all) (global-treesit-auto-mode 1)) (define-derived-mode cuda-ts-mode prog-mode "CUDA[ts]" "Major mode for editing CUDA with tree-sitter." (when (treesit-ready-p 'cuda) (treesit-major-mode-setup))) 
 Unfortunately, I have problems with the code:
  
When I open a .cu file, it is opened in Fundamental mode
 When I manually M-x cuda-ts-mode, it is enabled but I do not get syntax highlighting
 The CUDA parser is not automatically installed; I had to install it via M-x treesit-install-language-grammar and build the recipe interactively because it didn't find my provided recipe
  
What is wrong about the code?
 Thanks and I wish you all a happy new year!
 EDIT: I was able to get syntax highlighting working by calling (treesit-parser-create 'cuda) before (treesit-major-mode-setup) and by deriving from c-mode instead of prog-mode. Is this the correct solution?

It is organized by indentation, so it can be folded or hoisted to only show relevant sections by the two editors I use on it most frequently (vim and taskpaper). I just dump in there anything I think of, and freely re-organize (move up and down, indent, create headers and groups).  I keep tasks in taskpaper syntax, but essential to the model is the fact that anything can go in.

 Haskell is notoriously not very pretty when it comes to tooling and dev-environment.
 What would be, in your opinion, the cleanest way of setting up your toolchain and interacting with it? Consistent, sensible file locations, organized packages, and anything else you can think of.
 We're not going to get Cargo, but we can definitely do better than what I've seen a lot of people doing.
 Attempting to use as few tools as possible that accomplish as much as possible. 
 What is your minimalist, sane environment and tooling?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always had the scrollbars disabled in Emacs because they kind of stand out in an ugly way and they are visible on every window even if not needed (even in the minibuffer window). As the toolkit scrollbars in Emacs are nevertheless handy, I tinkered a bit to solve both problems: * 1: on-demand-scroll-bar-mode is an alternative to scroll-bar-mode that shows vertical scroll bars only when needed https://github.com/florommel/on-demand-scroll-bar * 2: custom-css allows to load arbitrary CSS snippets to style Emacs's GTK widgets. It comes with a dedicated mode to change the scrollbar visuals, as this requires special care. However, you can also adapt all other GTK widgets inside Emacs (menu bar, tool bar, context menus). The package requires a C module to be built and loaded and works only with GTK builds of Emacs. https://github.com/florommel/custom-css
 Both packages are experimental. Of course, they can be used independently from each other.

 My dream is to eventually build my own text editor with very simple features, but for now, I just want to get started using something other than Gedit. Emacs seems right because of the simplicity of setting custom key bindings, and the tables and code output in files.
 I understand that I need a theme.elfile and to place it in a folder. Then, I need to run some code to let Emacs know that the theme is there. However, I can't find the theme.el file, and I don't know which folder to place the theme in or what command I need to run. Help, please.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming out of EmacsConf, I'm converting over to lsp-bridge. Right now I'm doing mostly golang and WASM stuff and so I'm trying to figure out how to effectively use lsp-bridge with gopls. Looking at the lsp-bridge docs, it sure looks like gopls is first-class supported. However, I'm not getting anything lsp-bridge-y when I'm editing go code.
 Anyone care to share their working config snippet(s) for gopls and lsp-bridge? I would share mine except its such a moving target right now while I'm trying to get things working that I'm not sure it would produce productive feedback and probably just confuse folks who read the post a year from now.
 I'll make everyone a deal, I'll post my config once it's resolved however I will warn I'm a literate config person so it'd not only be elisp but also some other tooling for making sure all of the Python dependencies etc are installed. I guess folks would be free to copy/paste/modify as they see fit for their setup.
 Thx!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently using eglot for LSP and markdown-mode to render markdown in eldoc buffer.
 When I click on a link in an eldoc buffer for a rust project, it stops, flashes and then prints progn: Beginning of buffer in the *Message*.
 So, I figured maybe if I turn on toggle-debug-on-error I can find out where the error is happening. But, clicking the link does not trigger the error for debugging.
 So, I decided to put a message call at the beginning and end of the markdown-follow-thing-at-point (which is executed when you click on a link) like this:
 elisp (defun markdown-follow-thing-at-point (arg) "Follow thing at point if possible, such as a reference link or wiki link. Opens inline and reference links in a browser. Opens wiki links to other files in the current window, or the another window if ARG is non-nil. See `markdown-follow-link-at-point' and `markdown-follow-wiki-link-at-point'." (interactive "P") (message "markdown-follow-thing-at-point sos") (cond ((markdown-link-p) (markdown-follow-link-at-point)) ((markdown-wiki-link-p) (markdown-follow-wiki-link-at-point arg)) (t (let* ((values (markdown-link-at-pos (point))) (url (nth 3 values))) (unless url (user-error "Nothing to follow at point")) (markdown--browse-url url)))) (message "markdown-follow-thing-at-point sis")) 
 When I evaluate the defun and then click on the link again, it only prints the "markdown-follow-thing-at-point sos" which might imply that the function broke at some point, but I can't see why with toggle-debug-on-error.
 I ideally would like it if it at least open the url in a web browser :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Haskell community,
 I'm currently working on a Haskell project and have come across a challenge I hope you can help with. I've written several instances of functors in my source code, and I'm looking for an efficient way to ensure they comply with the Functor laws.
 Up until now, I've manually written tests for this purpose. You can see an example in my GitHub repository here: HaskellRank Functor Tests.
 Additionally, here's how I've been running these tests:
 (base) dewi@DewiJones:~/code/hask_tacer/hask-tracer2$ stack test --test-arguments='--match "/HaskellRank.HaskellRankJson/"' hask-tracer2> test (suite: spec, args: --match /HaskellRank.HaskellRankJson/) HaskellRank.HaskellRankJson Your Test Suite should pass the Functor Identity Law [✔] +++ OK, passed 100 tests. should pass the Functor Composition Law [✔] +++ OK, passed 100 tests. Finished in 0.0084 seconds 2 examples, 0 failures hask-tracer2> Test suite spec passed 
 While this approach works, it's quite manual and time-consuming. I'm wondering if there's a tool or a feature in GHC/Stack that can automatically scan all functor instances in my source code and check if they adhere to the Functor laws. Any suggestions or advice on how to streamline this process would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance!

 Linking to C code works fine, but with C++ I get a bunch of "undefined symbol ..." spit out by ld.lld.exe during cabal build. Using dumpbin.exe I can see the symbols are present in the lib I'm trying to link to. So I assume this is C++ ABI incompatibility MSYS2 and VC++.
 Can I somehow configure my build to use the VC++ ABI when building my Haskell code?

 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library for refined types in Scala. You can attach predicates (also called "refinements") to type and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive = 5 val y: Int :| Positive = -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] = -5.refineEither //Left("...") 
 Check the README for further information.
 Main changes
 Doobie & Skunk support
 You can use Iron types in your query and tables. Here is an example using iron-doobie:
 ```scala import doobie.* import doobie.implicits.*
 import io.github.iltotore.iron.* import io.github.iltotore.iron.constraint.all.* import io.github.iltotore.iron.doobie.given

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wolfram Mathematica can apparently function as an lsp server now https://github.com/WolframResearch/LSPServer and the official notebook editor gives the user a dexterity of code manipulation on par with notepad, so I put 2 and 2 together and attempted to make emacs use the lsp server with mixed results.
 I simply took the command to start the lsp server from the wolfram plugin of vscode and added it to eglot like
 (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '('xah-wolfram-mode "/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/13.3/Executables/WolframKernel" "`kernel`" "-noinit" "-noprompt" "-nopaclet" "-noicon" "nostartuppaclets" "-run" "Needs[\"LSPServer`\"];LSPServer`StartServer[]")) 
 With this, the eldoc and the flymake integration part of eglot works, but I'm not getting most of the rest of the functionality, in particular 'completion-at-point'.
 I also tried adding the same lsp server command to lsp-mode instead of eglot, but that just didn't work at all.
 (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(xah-wolfram-mode . "wolfram")) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection '("/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/13.3/Executables/WolframKernel" " `kernel` "" -noinit" "-noprompt " "-nopaclet" "-noicon" "-nostartuppaclets" "-run Needs[\"LSPServer`\"];LSPServer`StartServer[]")) :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on "wolfram") :server-id 'wolfram) 
 Does someone have any idea how to troubleshoot this? I'm really more interested in the eglot route because that is what I use otherwise. I do completion with corfu and it works in the languages that eglot supports by default. The problem is that I'm not really getting any error messages even with everything in 'eglot-strict-mode' turned on, so I have no idea what else to try.

 It's happening in `jsonrpc-events-buffer`, and I notice that there is no eglot events buffer in my emacs. (`eglot-events-buffer` says it can't find an Eglot events buffer.)
 `clangd` does start OK from the cmd line, as does my python language server.
 I'm not sure where to dig in to debug it.

 First, a little backstory.
 I have started getting interested in note-taking and knowledge bases about a year and a half ago. I first stumbled upon Notion, but quickly abandoned it due to its online-only nature. Then I started looking at alternatives like Obsidian and Logseq. Logseq caught my attention since it provided some nice features like daily journaling and "Everything is a node" strategy. I liked it. Then I learned that it was a watered down version of Emacs's org-mode. That is when I started looking into Emacs. This was a year ago.
 I fell in love instantly. It was mind boggling to me that you could change anything and nothing was off limits. This was a year ago and I still change things on a daily basis. I think I may have fallen into the rabbit hole of endless customiza…]]></summary>

 It's been a while since I've wanted to share my personal Emacs configuration. Either because I managed to configure something and someone needed help (like typescript on a React environment) or I needed help doing something and I was "afraid" of sharing it.
 Unfortunately my dotfile (yes, it was a ~/.emacs file) was ugly, old, slow and full of personal stuff.
 I managed to make it faster (0.6 seconds loadtime with ~95 packages on Linux), somewhat organized and (I hope) free of personal stuff.
 This config focuses on having the SAME (or close) user experience on both TUI and GUI. 
 Nowadays you can do things on tmux, for example, and you want to use Emacs as a sole editor with `emacs -nw` (the same fashion Neovim users do), others times you may want Emacs also as your terminal emulator and project organizer, you may want to start several instances of Emacs for gnus, ERC or other stuff, on either TUI or GUI. This config aims this situations, so nothing should be missing from GUI to TUI. You can even start it as a daemon and use at the same time on terminal and GUI without breaking anything.
 On this screenshot we have TUI (left) and GUI (right):

 It is made in a single file, using as much of default Emacs as possible, so you can fork it, customize or get inspired. It is not, by any means an "Emacs Distro".
 I'd love some nice feedbacks (preferably on Github issues so we can track and reuse issues).

Swimming with Ideas
This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Please be courageous and add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
Tags can either be used to categorize notes or give an idea of the note's theme. My subatomic is a short summary or theme that replaces a theming tag. Tagging is unnecessary overhead.  Tag for note status and grouping only. Let structure notes and linking dominate.
Web Historical Trails breadcrumbs, GPS adventure breadcrumbs, and how the metaphor can be applied to how I explore my journey with life.
Focusing attention is a skill much like wood carving. Focusing takes time to develop. It can be learned. There are better and worse ways to practice. A mentor boosts progress. This habit is susceptible to the usual biases—especially the Dunning-Kruger Effect.
Things I'm reading:
Calvino, Italo. The path to the spiders' nests. 1947.
Garmus, Bonnie. Lessons in chemistry. 2022.
Parrish, Shane. Clear thinking: turning ordinary moments into extraordinary results. 2023.
Voltaire. Candide. 1759.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, everyone! I'm so glad to have discovered this forum.
A question has been nagging me ever since I started my ZK journey, and that is: what do I do if I'm into multiple topics?
My interests are all over the place: I'm into photography, sociology, history, theology, philosophy, linguistics, and education.
I am not sure whether I should have one giant slip box for everything or multiple ones for topics that have stuff in common. But that would also raise a conundrum. I'm into photography, and I'm into art history, so those two topics could be in one slip box. But then I'm also into history in general, so should art history be a part of the box with history or photography? Again, this is just an example, not an actual dilemma.
I'm going through Ahrens' book but I don't know if it will touch on this particular topic. He does mention that Luhmann wrote on all sorts of subjects, which seems to indiciate he had a single slip box system for everything.
Has anyone here dealt with this?]]></summary>

 ​
 TL;DR I didn't like how Cassava/Aeson forced me to proliferate newtype wrappers for different kinds of date formats. The recipe pattern is about allowing me to specify different date parsing formats for each record type without newtype wrappers and keep generic derivation of record parsers.

 All the displayed icons are the same \"save\" icon. Note the wrong icon next to \"test.el\" file name. The icon only shows correctly in the lower scratch buffer.
 When invoking C-u C-x = I see this:
  position: 4 of 7 (43%), column: 3 character:  (displayed as ) (codepoint 57697, #o160541, #xe161) charset: unicode-bmp (Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (U+0000..U+FFFF)) code point in charset: 0xE161 syntax: w which means: word category: L:Strong L2R, j:Japanese to input: type "C-x 8 RET e161" buffer code: #xEE #x85 #xA1 file code: #xEE #x85 #xA1 (encoded by coding system utf-8-unix) display: by this font (glyph code): mac-ct:-*-Hannotate TC-regular-normal-normal-*-13-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#x8AA8) 
 It looks like it uses "Hannotate" as a font, which seems incorrect. However I am not sure how to change this.
 What I have tried or looked at:
  
I have both all-the-icons and nerd-icons fonts installed with their respective commands. I also don't think this is the issue as I can see the correct icon in the scratch buffer.
 I have tried the solutions suggested in this reddit thread. However, it doesn't work for me. I also tried to do (set-fontset-font t 'unicode (font-spec :family "all-the-icons") nil) (i.e. without 'append), and whilst this works for the mode-line it messes up my icons in other places (e.g. dired buffers) as well. 
 Related to the thread above, I also don't have any set-fontset-font in my config, nor any mention of unicode. So I don't think I am changing any fonts in my config in this regard.
 
 I have looked at other similar reddit threads as well, and despite there being many on this topic there hasn't been a solution that has worked so far.
 For whatever reason, the same config works on my other laptop which is also a Macbook with the same Emacs installation.
  
If it matters, I am on MacOS using emacs-plus (29.1).
 Any help is appreciated!

 it "gets the chapter name" $ do Chapter.name chapter `shouldBe` "Protection of Children from Abuse and Neglect"

 Hi, for the life of me I can't figure how to use Memotrie or any other method to memoize, say, an HTML parsing function. I want to memoize it so I can write a bunch of Hspecs without re-parsing the HTML for each spec.
 IOW, I need a memoized test fixture. There used to be something on the Hspec site but it was removed.
  
Somehow I accidentally deleted the rest of my post. The important stuff is up there. :-P

 I've downloaded Doom Emacs and configured so it would have support for JavaScript, Python, Rust, and Web, but when I run the command doom doctor it tells me:
  > :lang python ! Couldn't find black. Code formatting will not work. ! Couldn't find pyflakes. Import management will not work. ! Couldn't find isort. Import sorting will not work. ! Couldn't find pipenv. pipenv support will not work. ! Couldn't find nosetests. Running tests through nose will not work. ! Couldn't find pytest. Running tests through pytest will not work. > :lang web ! Couldn't find tidy. Code formatting in HTML modes will not work. ! Couldn't find stylelint. Linting for CSS modes will not work. There are 8 warnings! 
 This are things that I have in my system, for example: 
 kelisei@Debian:~/.emacs.d$ pip list | grep black black 23.12.1 kelisei@Debian:~/.emacs.d$ npm -v tidy 9.2.0 
 I've tried searching but no one seems to have this particular error, some info that would be relevant:
  
Python version: 3.12.1
 Distro: Debian 12 
 NPM version: 9.2.0
 I've installed it from the package manager: emacs-gtk/stable,now 1:28.2+1-15 amd64 [installed]
 Thank you!

 Special thanks to u/eli-zaretskii for guiding me through this problem. Original post is here 
 First it's important to note that as of today <29-12-2023>, on Emacs 29.1, it is NOT possible to have a colored emojis in Emacs. However it is possible to have black-and-white emojis, so here is a guide. 
 First make sure you have the right version. Open Emacs and check the version with: M-x version RET

 Elisp doesn’t use namespaces or private variables. This means you’re basically living in the Wild West. The only thing that prevents constant name collisions is that people are responsible about naming everything with appropriate prefixes.
 EDIT: The specific use-case I'm considering is color-coding tabs for buffers. I know there are a couple packages that support tabs for buffers, and I'm currently using centaur-tabs. However, centaur-tabs has no color-coding options. I anticipate it will take a decent amount of work (and a better understanding of emacs/elisp than I have now) to achieve the color-coding that I want.

 I know there have been a few posts on eglot setup lately, but had trouble making things work as they should using all the advice there.
 Briefly, I was able to make eglot work for built-in package such as `os` or `sys` (though not consistently), but was never able to make completions work for installed packages (such as numpy or pandas). 
 I strongly suspect that the lsp server is not using the right Python version (I tried all servers, pyls, jedi, etc.). How can I coerce eglot and the underlying server to use the right Python version, and to load the right PYTHONPATHs? 
 In general, I use pyenv, and I use 
 (setq python-shell-interpreter "/Users/$USER/.pyenv/shims/ipython" 
 python-shell-interpreter-args "-i --simple-prompt")
 ​
 Thanks for the help!

 I'm wondering why I keep coming back to custom code snippets on StackOverflow whenever I need to colorise a buffer that has ANSI colours in it. Here's a sample from a Rails app:
  Parameters: {"id"=>"27"} [1m[36mUser Load (1.0ms)[0m [1m[34mSELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = $1 ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT $2[0m [["id", 2], ["LIMIT", 1]] ↳ app/controllers/application_controller.rb:27:in `set_establishment' [1m[36mEstablishment Load (0.7ms)[0m [1m[34mSELECT "establishments".* FROM "establishments" WHERE "establishments"."id" = $1 LIMIT $2[0m [["id", 2], ["LIMIT", 1]] 
 Are ANSI escape sequences trickier than they seem? I'm going to resort to a custom bit of code (thank you people of StackOverflow) but I was wondering why log-view-mode or compilation-mode don't have it built-in?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the documentary Kevin Hart & Chris Rock: Headliners Only (Netflix, 2023) while preparing for a portion of their tour, Kevin Hart admires a portion of Chris Rock's stand up comedy method and calls it "a science". Chris Rock writes headlines for his jokes on slips of paper and then arranges them on either tables or small bulletin boards to outline his set list for presenting jokes for his performances.


If there are interesting contemporaneous news items which appear, he'll include a newspaper or other material to represent the related joke for inclusion into his set. This makes a fascinating means of outlining his material and seems to fall within the realm of my search for zettelkasten output processes. Even if Rock doesn't use index cards to write or store his jokes like comedians in the past have, he's using a slip-based method for outlining and arranging them as part of his output process.

Kevin Hart: Chris, I'm so... I'm so, uh blown away by what I'm discovering that is your process.
Chris Rock: My process.
Kevin Hart: This all your shit?


Chris Rock: Well, this here would be, uh, bullet points for tonight. Every card represents a joke or a reference that I choose. I don't wanna forget. You know what I mean? Like, you can remember all your jokes, but some nights, I'm like, 'ehhh, I'm not gonna close with this one. I'm gonna close with that one'.
Kevin Hart: You have it down to a science where you can bullet point the time.
Chris Rock: You can. And by the way, sometimes, something happens in the news.
Kevin Hart: You got jokes on the bench.
Chris Rock: I have jokes on the bench.

Kevin Hart: I'm going to tell you I'm not only impressed by that, but I'm disappointed in myself. Because, uh, whatever I got, got to to fly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm talking about row level multi tenancy, where each row in your relational database has a tenant_id column. You could solve this by using different schemas or database or whatever else but we have Haskell at our disposal, so let's focus (but not constrain) the discussion on that.
 The goals are:
  
Make it very hard (but maybe not impossible) for tenants to access each other's data
 End up with a convenient interface
 Use an already established DB library
  
I've worked on a few projects with such multi tenancy and have never really been "satisfied" with how we've done this.
 Project 1 used template Haskell to generate "repository" code that had the filtering built-in. We were lucky enough that for our usecase this was fine. TH was not very pleasant to use and the approach is rather limiting.
 Project 2 was simply relying on the developers to not forget to add the appropriate filter.
 Project 3 uses a custom database library that has quite a lot of type level wizardry but it basically boils down to attaching the tenant id filter at the end of each query. The downside is that we basically need to reimplement everything that already exists in established DB libraries from scratch. Joins are a pain so we resort to SQL views for more complicated queries.
 Is there an established way people go about this? Maybe some DB libraries already can handle it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on the graph problems from the famous Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems. Most of the problems involve searching/traversal of the graph, and I'm pretty confused about how to approach the solutions idiomatically. I'm looking for some help in evaluating one the following options:
  
Basic recursion: Pass the state around during recursive calls, and use if-then-else to prune/terminate as necessary. This is the simplest choice, but results in similar-looking boilerplate code. 
 Same as above but using the State monad.
 Model a search problem as a tuple of (start value, expanding frontier function, terminating condition), and provide implementations of the 2nd and 3rd items for each algorithm. This model is shown here and looks promising in reducing boilerplate.
 Read a novel academic paper, like Structuring Depth-First Search Algorithms in Haskell or Backtracking, Interleaving, and Terminating Monad Transformers and come up with an implementation. FWIW, it seems like the Data.Graph library implementation is based on the former paper (but for the purposes of the exercise I shouldn't use).
 Logic and Continuation: This option is mentioned in passing in some places but there is exactly zero online literature available as far as any practical examples go. None whatsoever. I don't even know why would I choose this option, other than it potentially reducing boilerplate. The H-99 problems aren't for infinite graphs, and ask for all answers, not the first one, so, fairness/interleaving isn't really a concern.
  
A somewhat related question had been asked before, although it focussed on a specific advent of code problem and lacked the research I've laid out above. Nothing against the question, just saying that the comments there don't preempt my question.
 What would be the most elegant option? If there's one that's not listed above, please do tell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm about a month into my emacs adventures with a primary focus with using it for org documents. I am on MacOS and use doom emacs currently as my distro. 
 When exporting with LaTeX pdf I get: "zsh:1: command not found: pdflatex" in my Org PDF LaTeX Output buffer. LaTeX is installed on my machine and the export works fine from terminal emacs (emacs -nw) so from what I've read this is likely a PATH issue. However, the whole setting a PATH so that emacs can see where LaTeX is is over my head with my current knowledge as I have little experience in terminal. 
 Is anyone able to explain how to go about letting emacs see where LaTeX is installed? Or maybe insight into a solution if this isn't the issue?
 I know where pdflatex is by running "which pdflatex" in terminal but do not know next steps.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are in the company of friends.
The time between the solstice and the new year is a time for introspection, reflection, and gratitude. It's a time to look back on the year that has passed and think about what we have learned and achieved. And more importantly, it's a time to look forward to the new year and set intentions for ourselves.
I am grateful for the inspiration I receive from your posts and comments and for seeing what you are studying. We can brainstorm, debate, and explore new ideas together. By doing so, we can push the boundaries of our thinking and gain a deeper understanding of the world around us.
A forum post can be the starting point for a stream of ideas.
Thank you, everyone. (Including, you transient lurkers.)]]></summary>

 Lets say I have this emacs lisp snippet:
 (defcustom my-file-custom-variable "/home/user/my-file.txt" "Path to my file." :type 'file) 
 Emacs manual(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Simple-Types.html) mentions this about the file widget type:
  
The value must be a file name. The widget provides completion.
  
But I cannot get my emacs to perform autocompletion on file path. Is there something wrong with my elisp snippet? is there any key binding to trigger autocompletion? Is there some additional setup required for autocompletion in customize buffer? Or do I simply misunderstand the emacs manual?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've been using org-roam for a while now, but I recently started to go a bit deeper with customization and wanted your opinion on my current workflow and possible ways to automate and improve it.
 Basically, I'm trying to use org-roam as an issue tracker with issue, task and time management, similarly to tools like redmine.
 Currently my workflow is as follows:
  
I have an issues.org file containing all issues and their state (TODO, STRT, etc.)
 Every time a new issue comes in, I add it to that file and assign an id with `org-id-get-create`
 For that new issue, I also create a new org file specific to that issue to track description, comments, etc. and roam-link the original TODO item to it
 I use org-roam-dailies to then reference the TODO item from issues.org, clock spent time and add tasks as sub items.
  
This is working mostly fine for me, I'm able to build precise monthly reports over the issues I've been working on, however, there's a bit of a "disconnection" between dailies and the overall issues file.
 As the issue state is only recorded in issues.org, the agenda never shows the actual state of the issue when I clock-in, as that's only a roam-link to the original issue. Conversely, time tracking only happens at the daily-level and it's never reflected back to the original issue. Also, having tasks as sub-items in the dailies makes it easy to track all tasks by searching for roam back references, but at the same time it creates a lot of duplication because sub tasks are not carried over to the next day for example.
 Here I'm asking for your opinion, because I'm not sure if I'm just using org and roam the "wrong way" and I'm not supposed to try to achieve any of this, or if it's a somewhat valid approach and I just need to automate it.
 Thank you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am reading the book "Algorithm Design with Haskell" and have some questions relating to greedy algorithms.
 The book introduces a nondeterministic "greedy condition" as follows:
  gstep x (MinWith cost cs) ← MinWith cost (map (gstep x) cs) 
 gstep x refers to a "greedy step" that optimally extends a candidate by the component x.
 In page 162, it asserts that this condition holds if we can prove the following monotonicity condition
  cost c ≤ cost c' ⇒ cost (gstep x c) ≤ cost (gstep x c') 
 for all c and c' (where c' comes after c in the list of candidates cs)
 In page 181, it says that the greedy condition is satisfied if the monotonicity condition holds for all c and c' (regardless of their positions in the list, I assume).
 My questions are
  
Which version is correct?
 If the first one is correct, then for cost c = cost c', does cost (gstep x c) < cost (gstep x c') violate the monotonicity condition?
 If the second one is correct, then for cost c = cost c', does cost (gstep x c) have to equal cost (gstep x c')?
  
Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use tabspaces + project.el so each tab in the tab bar represents its own project. Like this:
 https://preview.redd.it/pxku3u4x3p8c1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bc23614698024dd7232b689707c1eb48fc067ec
 I've only made some trivial customisations but not sure where to go to make it a little bit more helpful. This is basically it.
 (setq tab-bar-close-button-show nil) (setq tab-bar-tab-hints t) 
 Every example I've seen so far seems to be specific to a config framework like Doom or Nano. No complaints there but would be keen to see some other unique examples in the wild.
 What have you got, if you use tabs? Since we're in emacs I figured they could do a lot more than this, as with the modeline and minibuffer.

I have tried to (setq w32-alt-is-meta nil), but this does not seem to work. For example, setting (global-set-key (kbd "A-x") #'execute-extended-command) does not let me use Alt+x to execute a command. Instead, A-x is mapped to insert-char, and it actually inserts a multiplication sign! I get similar output for Alt+ other characters on windows. Is there a way to get Emacs on Windows to read "A-x" as "A-x"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to define a function - calcLayer - that performs matrix-vector multiplication and adds biases to the resulting product.
 module Neural where import Linear data DenseLayer = DenseLayer {weights :: Linear.Matrix Float, biases :: Linear.Vector Float} calcLayer :: Num dataType => Linear.Vector dataType -> DenseLayer -> Linear.Vector dataType calcLayer ingress layer = Linear.vecSum (Linear.matVecMul (weights layer) ingress) (biases layer) 
 ​
 This will not compile. When I remove the function's "Num" type constraint everything builds just fine:
 module Neural where import Linear data DenseLayer = DenseLayer {weights :: Linear.Matrix Float, biases :: Linear.Vector Float} calcLayer :: Linear.Vector Float -> DenseLayer -> Linear.Vector Float calcLayer ingress layer = Linear.vecSum (Linear.matVecMul (weights layer) ingress) (biases layer) 
 ​
 I'm not exactly sure how to justify to myself why this worked as a solution. In my head, the previous version said that "datatype" is restricted to the "Num" typeclass. Doesn't "Float" fall under that umbrella?
 ​
 I'm trying to keep everything as general as possible, so preferably I would even like my DenseLayer definition to be able to accept other types belonging to the Num typeclass (not just Float), but I'm not sure if there is a way to do that with record syntax.
 ​
 Beyond shedding some light on why this worked, any criticism or advice will also be greatly appreciated.

 I'm a digital ASIC/IC designer using SystemVerilog/Verilog to design digital logic HW. I got started learning Clash to model digital logic hardware since this week since I wanna feel the power of functional programming in hardware design. However, I don't have any functional programming background and thus I jumped start from modeling shift-registers with length N in Clash by the assistant of ChatGPT. It goes well but I cannot feel the power of functional programming in the context of digital hardware to be honest. Thus, I'm here to hear from your suggestion. What minimum design case example can show the value of Clash against VHDL/Verilog? Or what's the realistic benefits of Clash against traditional RTL HW description language? Thank you

 ​
 Still new to the Emacs space and slowly making my way through the emacs mastering book :)
 ​
 I was wondering on a few things.
 1: How do people avoid hurting their fingers using the default emacs keybindings, i.e. using control and meta keys so frequently.
 a. I understand people use vim keybindings to avoid this
 b. But want to know if people just bare it/its not as bad as its made out to be (i.e. classic emacs pinky)
 2: What keyboard do you use and does it help avoid finger contortions with the control and meta key.
 a. Sorta wondering how the custom keyboard space merges with the emacs space, i.e. is the miryoku layout with homerow mods helpful etc.
  
For those who use intellij, how has emacs influenced your workflow. I see there's IdeaVim and IntelliMacs alongside the Emacs intellij keybindings, how have you setup IntelliJ in light of your emacs usage
  
Thanks for your time!

 emacs 29.1 has eglot baked in, and M-x eglot asked for access to an executable provided by python (pylsp)
  
pip install "python-lsp-server[all]" into a dummy venv
 Add the venv's bin/ to $PATH
 And M-x eglot connects to the language server!
  
eglot now finds indent errors, syntax errors, highlights all instances of variables, and gives guidance on functions like print (although is in the minibuffer and not well formatted for my eyes)
 But it does not give command or variable completion which I think is supposed to come from jedi.
 My question is - how to get eglot to speak to jedi? 
 Is completion supposed to come from 
  
pylsp (in the python venv) speaking with python jedi,
 through eglot speaking directly to jedi (in the python venv) or
 directly between emacs buffer hook and emacs jedi (which I cant find in the package-list)
  
Tried with emacs 28 - but eglot wasn't in the package-list
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I somehow didn't managed to insert the picture in the post, so here it is as a link to imgur.
 As you can see in the picture, I've succeeded to get Icon rendering in Dired on Windows 10, however emojis do not work at all.
 Seems weird that I'm able to render icons and not emojis. I understand they are different, but I'm not getting why the one is able to be displayed and the other is not.
 I've read every article I could find on this sub and google about Emojis in Emacs on Windows, but most articles are either 2+ year old, or have some broken links and succeeded to fix this issue.
 I'm running native Emacs on Windows, I'm not using WSL. I'm using Emacs 28.2.
 I have installed all-the-icons. I also have installed "Noto Color Emoji" and put this in my ~/.emacs:
 (set-fontset-font t 'symbol "Noto Color Emoji")
 And evaluated. I've also tried with "native" windows emoji font: Segoe UI Emoji, but same story.
 I'm getting the emoji in the buffer, but it's invisible. If I copy it from, say, emojipedia and CTRL + y in a buffer, the cursor moves as if something was inserted, but nothing is shown as if I inserted a SPC.
 However if I CTRL+a CTRL+k and then paste it in, say, my browser, I get all the emojis I've inserted in the buffer.
 My question is - Has the Windows API changed(that is the reason, allegedly, why it didn't work in the past as I've read about this issue on this sub) or is there some other way to display emojis in Emacs buffer on Windows 10 that bypasses this API problem or whichever other problem there is.
 On my Linux machine everything works fine, however, unfortunately, sometimes I'm forced to use Windows and thus want to make it work here as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently using org-roam, org-roam-bibtex, citar, and citar-org-roam and embark. When I have a citation link in my org file, I click on it and it opens embark showing all the actions I can take. Since it is a new note, I click on citar-open-notes, which automatically extracts the title and author and populates it into my capture template:
  (org-roam-capture-templates '(("n" "literature note" plain "%?" :target (file+head "${slug}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n#+filetags: :paper:\n#+author: ${author}\n#+created: %U\n#+STARTUP: latexpreview\n") :unnarrowed t))) 
 Now, my bibtex file contains information about the paper's year, and journal and I was hoping to extract it automatically just like it does with the ${title} and ${author}, but it does not appear to be the case. So I was wondering how this can be achieved such that citar automatically extracts the other pieces of info in the citation. I tried searching the citar-org-roam github, but I was not able to find something like this in the documentation. So currently, I am just using the following:
 (use-package citar-org-roam :straight t :after (citar org-roam) :config (citar-org-roam-mode) ) ;; You can also use citar-org-roam to plugin to org-roam-bibtex, like so: (citar-register-notes-source 'orb-citar-source (list :name "Org-Roam Notes" :category 'org-roam-node :items #'citar-org-roam--get-candidates :hasitems #'citar-org-roam-has-notes :open #'citar-org-roam-open-note :create #'orb-citar-edit-note :annotate #'citar-org-roam--annotate)) (setq citar-notes-source 'orb-citar-source)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to use code that I wrote in one file in a separate org file. I'd like to use this in combination with the ability to chain org blocks together. What I am imagining is there being a thing like #+include: to import any code I want to use from there to my org file, without actually exporting the contents of the first file. So, for example, if I have a file one.org with the contents...
 #+name: test #+begin_src python x = "Hello World" #+end_src 
 I would like to be able to use this in another file two.org in a way like...
 #+include-but-dont-export: pathto/one.org #+begin_src python :include test print(x) #+end_src #+results: : Hello World 
 Is there anything like this, currently? Thanks.

 I have several mail configured in gnus and smtp-multi, as I couldn't get the smtp separated sending with only the posting styles. It is pretty simple really and it works with application passwords,
 ​
 However, I recently have to be checking now an Exchange work mail, and the reason I was using GNUS in the first place is not to have external dependencies like with mbsync... Is there any configuration that I can do to still get this mail?, or am I doomed to go to another app or use davmail?,

 Likewise, I'm currently running a high-bandwidth Haskell application on http-client, but the program keeps on crashing (without exceptions).
 I think we've been generally aware that Haskell networking has been a bit retrograde for quite some time, but it'd be nice if someone (else, not me) would help step up to get Haskell's networking libs back on track.

 This blog entry doesn't really convince me why I should prefer type families over Fundeps, especially since functional dependencies seem more elegant to me instead of introducing additional types or even another extensions like "type family dependencies".
 Here is a "radical suggestion" that fits this topic well:
 https://typesandkinds.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/what-are-type-families/
 Accordingly, functional dependencies seems less problematic…

 I am, for some reason, writing a screen play, and taught it will be helpful to distinct different elements of scripts by applying different background colour to blocks.

 I think maybe it should be like this, but I don't know what to put instead of "org-src-block-faces".

 I'm using Doom Emacs, and according to this, if I have something tagged :important: And something else tagged :important:chore:
 I should be able to do a tag search like important-chore or +important&-chore to be more explicit. But the negation doesn't seem to work at all when I do the search, it works the opposite. If I do +important&-chore it ONLY shows me things marked :important:chore: 
 I would think that it's completely broken, but it IS searching the org files correctly and finding tags. 
 Match tag search
 Search for important
 Try to negate chore

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My work involves a fair amount of time spent in the terminal, in docker containers, on remote machines via ssh, and sometimes in containers on remote machines. To support this, I’ve developed a customized terminal experience on kitty. Basically, if I open a new tab, it will clone my current environment, including the container/remote, current directory, and current bashrc. And it also color-codes tabs based on the type of environment I’m in. 
 I’m curious if it would be possible/interesting/desirable to recreate this setup in emacs, with the ultimate goal of using emacs as a customized ide + terminal emulator. 
 Does anyone have thoughts on this? The first issue that I see is that so far, I haven’t found a tab bar for emacs that supports customizing the colors of the tabs. I’m sure this is possible, but I’m too new to emacs to know how difficult it would be (I have experience coding in multiple lisp dialects, so needing to code in order to customize is not a drawback). Thanks.
 (EDIT: I guess this is partly a question about customizing emacs and partly a question about using emacs as my primary terminal emulator.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two days ago I wrote a small experiment that lets me include Lisp as a template placeholders. It looks something like this:
 1 + 2 = {{ 3 }} 1 + 2 = {{ (+ 1 2) }} 1 + 2 = {{! escaped }} 
 I used Mustache-like syntax, to basically just delimit Lisp region from the rest of the text. However, due to Lisp paranthesized syntax it is possible to simplify it. I have now re-written it so it just needs one marker to mark which expression is to be evaluated as Lisp:
 1 + 2 = %%3 1 + 2 = %%(+ 1 2) 1 + 2 = %%!escaped 
 Due to Emacs being a text processing toolkit and a Lisp repl/environment, that basically let us use Emacs Lisp as a template language in text files. The intended use is file and code generators.
 The simplified syntax turnes out to be slightly harder to process than the one with start and end delimiters, however I think it might be worth, so here is an experiment to test the idea.
 Download and details about the usage details are in online repo.
 I appreciate critique and discussion, especially if you find a bug or some fundamental problem.

 Blamer.el

 Blamer.el is a minor mode for Emacs that shows the last modification date and the author of the current line or the current region in the overlay from git.
 The package can be slow on very large repositories, so I'm testing asynchronous functionality now and plan to make a release early next year.

 I've been using fzf, an excellent tool for searching through bash history. It employs an interactive fuzzy finder that's activated with CTRL+R, making it easier to find what I am after.
 I'm wondering if there's a similar tool available for GHCI. Such a tool would ideally offer an interactive, fuzzy search method for sifting through GHCI history.
 Many thanks in advance for any suggestions! :)

 Do some themes have a way of adjust the cursor colors to match at runtime or there none whatsoever?

 pandoc test-export.org -t markdown --o test-export.qmd 
 test-export.qmd then looks like
 ``` python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` ``` python plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) ``` ``` {.python eval="no"} print("Hello World!") ``` 
 The problem is that Quarto expects 
 ```{python} 
 to denote Python code blocks. (I can understand that pandoc makdown conversion should not know to convert :eval no to #| eval: false in the code block but that is secondary).
 I could write a post-text-processing script to handle this but I wonder if there is a more direct way to at least get the language specification to be {python} instead of python or {.python ...}. I have also tried exporting to other Markdown flavors using pandoc, and using Org-mode's built-in Markdown exporter. I guess the built-in exporter targets the original Markdown
 # Table of Contents import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) print("Hello World!") 
 so is even further away from the Quarto form.
 AFAIK the Quarto documentation only defines the Quarto -> Org transformation and not the other way around. 
 Thanks for your suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I wrote org-roam-pygraph, a small Python library to extract the natural graph structure associated to a collection of org-roam nodes.
 Recently I took up a project of running some data analysis on my org-roam collection. In the process, I decided to write a more featureful Python library to assist in all the grunt work of extracting information from the org-roam database.
 Features
  
Several "indices" are provided, which are dictionaries with roam-node IDs as keys and some data pertaining to that node as values. Indices provided are 
 Title index (data: title of node)
 Filename index (data: where the node is located)
 Tags index (data: tags the node has)
 Backlink index (data: list of roam-node IDs a node links to)
 Org link index (data: list of org links that are not backlinks to other nodes)
 Node body index (data: the body text of the node)
 Math snippets index (data: list of LaTeX snippets in the body of a node)
 Source block index (data: list of src blocks in body text, tagged by language)
 
 networkx representation of your org-roam collection. You can use networkx to do all kinds of graph analytics on your collection, including visualization, which is how I made the cover image for the git repo.
 Basic manipulations of the collection 
 Filter collection by tags
 Remove orphan nodes
 
  
The code can be found at https://github.com/aatmunbaxi/orgroamtools, and the code is documented at https://aatmunbaxi.github.io/orgroamtools. The package is available on PyPI, and can be installed with pip install orgroamtools.
 PRs and issue reports are welcome.

 Is there a way to check all sub items at once, not C-c C-c them all one by one?
 C-c C-c on Things to dojust gives error message
 org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c: Cannot toggle this checkbox: unchecked subitems
 I looked up the manual page for Checkboxes, and one way seems to mark all the items you like to check and C-c C-c, but wondering if there is an easier way for a checkbox subtree?

For some reason any time I <tab> complete imports in typescript files, company-mode (I assume) is appending a $1 to the end of the name. For example, if I were to type import {Rec and then press <tab> to complete I would expect the result to be import { Recipe } from './recipes/recipe.model where Recipe is the name of the class. Instead my tab-completion is imported as import { Recipe$1 } from './recipes/recipe.model'; 
 This additional $1 only occurs when importing packages- not when using tab completions for anything else. Happy to provide any pieces of my init file that would be of use to help me solve this!

 I want to read mail list provided by nntp and gmail. It seems that both the way by offlineimap and dovecot and the way by leafnoe are needed. Is that correct? Or the combination of offlineimap and dovecot can also help fetch nntp mail.
 It would be great if anyone can help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Emacs speedrun videos, I have a lot of org docs stacked up that needs recording.
 However, especially with subjective choices with lots of valid options, community breadth is more valuable that individual depth.
 What are habits, tools, configuration choices, fundamental and advanced, that you would recommend to a programmer to ramp up quickly, all the way to becoming productive at working on Elisp packages?
 Videos are around 5-10min and count on the viewer to do the work but try to let them know when to go deep and what on.
 I'll go first: * Intrinsic types in Emacs (and how to relate it to understanding the UI) * Apropos and small tricks to use docstring conventions to search for types * Byte compiling * Structural editing of some variety * Evaluate in other buffer, all the evaluation workflows and their tradeoffs * Persistence, be it org mode, saving scratch, writing modules, or ielm history * All the bells & whistles in the helpful package, including using it to quickly find the right manual contents * Fuzzy searches for symbols and important search keys like "-hook$" and "-functions?$" etc * Edebug & debug * LLM prompting to overcome lack of proper vocabulary & language barrier * Shortdocs * The built-in Emacs glossary * Macrostep * Tests * Process, JSON-RPC, HTTP * Probably some CL because I think the built-in loop structures are just anemic, but I want to stick to bread & butter cl-lib. That said, what do you consider bread & butter?
 Even if I don't share your views, I will try to make sure that sources of high value with at least a significant fraction of users are represented. It costs very little extra time to mention something like, "If you are doing X a lot or when you get to Y, people say try adopting Z."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to create a habit where I run three times a week. So I decided to set a org habit that is set to every 56 hours as follows using org-gtd:
 ** Running SCHEDULED: <2023-12-22 Fri 23:00 ++56h> :PROPERTIES: :ID: Running-2023-12-22-22-02-57 :STYLE: habit :END: [2023-12-22 Fri 21:57] 
 In the org manual, it says that I should be able to do this. But when I open the agenda view, I am hit with the error: Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Invalid duration string: ++56h")
 Why is it not possible to do this? Or is there another way to achieve this?

I can get this example to work by omitting the fac :: Int -> Int line but this error in particular is really starting to bug me.
 The following gives a parse error at |fac 0 = 1:
 fac :: Int -> Int |n :: Int |fac 0 = 1 |fac n = n * fac (n-1) main = print (fac 42) 
 This gives a parse error on '::' at n :: Int:
 fac :: Int -> Int n :: Int fac 0 = 1 fac n = n * fac (n-1) main = print (fac 42)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i have been training for a job in the medical field (maybe a bit of an understatement in regards to the cost and mental toil, but saying i'm in med school has its implications because i'm really not.) and about two-and-a-bit months ago, i decided to start a zettelkasten. i learned all about it and wrote notes about the underlying philosophy in the zettelkasten itself, and things started off fantastic! MOCs and hub notes feel like a dream for my personal organization. higher-order learning seemed extremely necessary. disregarding the idea of separate disciplines in lieu of an understanding rooted in existing knowledge seemed very helpful.
now it's been a couple months and my zettelkasten contains over 100 zettels; i'd say about 20 regarding personal knowledge management and then about 80 medical notes. that is the problem, though. i look at other notemakers' obsidian graphs and they're one big ideaverse of notes radiating from the center. my notes, conversely, are separated into blobs by discipline or level of abstraction from reality. (e.g. anatomy [tangible] vs. study concepts [intangible]) in essence, i want to keep watching my zettelkasten grow--it is helping me retain information--but i'm a bit scared that i'm not implementing higher-order learning correctly.
this is making me unsure whether a traditional, luhmann-esque zettelkasten is the best idea for medical study. what do you think? does anyone else have trouble connecting tangible, business-related zettels to more abstract zettels?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, Flyspell highlights every single word, even if it's correct and if it exists in the dictionary. At first, I thought it's an issue with aspell, so I switched to hunspell, but the behavior is the same. I do have hunspell installed on the system, dictionaries too (using Romanian language), running hunspell -D in console shows that the dictionaries are loaded:
 LOADED DICTIONARY: /Users/claudiu/Library/Spelling/ro_RO.aff /Users/claudiu/Library/Spelling/ro_RO.dic 
 This is my spellcheck config bit from init.el:
 (setenv "DICTIONARY" "ro_RO") (setenv "DICPATH" (concat (getenv "HOME") "/Library/Spelling")) (setq ispell-program-name "hunspell") (setq ispell-really-hunspell t) (setq ispell-dictionary "ro_RO") (setq ispell-local-dictionary "ro_RO") (setq ispell-dictionary-alist '(("ro_RO" "[[:alpha:]]" "[^[:alpha:]]" "[']" nil ("-d" "ro_RO") nil utf-8))) 
 Every single word in the image below exists in the dictionary and shouldn't be highlighted. Anyone have any idea why this is happening?

 I'd hoped that typescript-ts-mode (ts for treesitter) would work for editing .js files containing jsx, but reformat at least doesn't work. It could well be my set-up, but is there anyone here using tree sitter versions of js modes successfully with react/jsx from emacs 29? If not, what is the current "best thing" - googling js/jsx with emacs opens pandora's box and I'm really pretty confused as to how best to move forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I'm a Haskell novice and have been challenged to make something like a chess engine. I love the idea of doing it in Haskell and also doing it properly™ (i.e. overengineering the hell outta it lol).
 I already have a program (involuntarily written in Java) to store/output the board state and determine whether someone won.\ What I intend to create is the following: 1. a protocol between the Java program and 2. (see below)\ this will contain things like "NEWGAME", "TURN xy", "RESPONSE zw", etc. 2. a Haskell program that implements that protocol to actually generate a good next move and send it back to the Java application, which 3. I will modify to be able to talk to my "engine"
 So what is your folks' opinion on how to structure the Haskell code / protocol?\ I came up with this: - CECP-/UCI-like protocol: one move sent at a time, my program would need to store that somehow\ however, I don't have any idea on how to elegantly do this in Haskell and wonder whether it can even be done idiomatically - get the complete board state as input each time and output the next move / new state; as easy as it gets and seems to fit really well with the functional paradigm BUT extremely inefficient and not what I would do if I was programming it in another language (also apparently not how most protocols work…)
 Dear, epic, most valued, mathematically blessed computer scientists, can you bestow some advice upon me, so I can maybe become worthy of joining your ranks one day?
 Thanks in advance and happy holidays! :)

 I've noticed that when I start the interpreter (using run-python), the interpreter doesn't have any of my variables: os.environ shows a bunch of useful variables but none of the ones I've set in my shell-config file (~/.zshrc).
 I've been digging through the code and it seems that the python interpreter process is ultimately started by make-comint-in-buffer. What is the preferred solution to ensure that this function picks up all the variables I want before starting the process?

 (global-unset-key (kbd "C-w")) (global-set-key (kbd "C-w") 'delete-window) 
 Edit: Looks like evil-mode added a whole bunch of keybindings for working with windows that all start with C-w. I think I'll try actually using those.
 One things I'm still unclear about: Did global-unset fail to remove these because they aren't global? Or did it fail because you'd have to unset each binding that begins with C-w individually? 
 I'm hoping it's not the second one. That's a lot of commands, if you have to unbind each one individually.

Since then single ESC isn't respected in tui (-nw) but works fine in gui. Same for the arrow keys. They're fine in gui but in tui they force me into insert mode (with a flash of M-o being undefined) and type ABCD.
 I get the same behaviour with -Q and then eval (require 'evil), so it's something that's changed upstream and not in my config.
 Anyone else affected and have found a solution?

 https://preview.redd.it/ny5s3y04iu7c1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2eedd6ef87a036c1b0c9e931c135b4de3c63d0a
 I can get rid of it using toggle-fullscreen-mode, but that also hides the system menu. I don't want fullscreen, I just want the bar gone.
 Any way to do that?
 Thanks!

 But I don't understand state monads, functors or monad transformers. I tried "scala with cats" and gave up after a few chapters. So I don't know how to use cats-core
 Now can I jump to learn cats effect or zio ? For now I don't want to learn advanced Haskell-like FP concepts, but focusing on writing pure functions and handling IO in an FP way. Just don't know if cats effect or Zio require understanding of these concepts (I just want to use cats effect or zio, not trying to understand what's behind the scenes)
 And if you think it's ok, which one is simpler in you opinion? Some also say Future is enough, do you recommend I just learn how to use Future as a monad to solve real world problems?

 I don't know what Doing vfork means, all i know is that some file is missing. But how do i find out WHAT file is missing? Non of the buffers (lsp log, lsp stderr etc.) say something meaning full... how do i debug this? --debug-init is useless i think because the error dose not occur during init.

 I can't figure out how the pointfree expression type checks (it does). I understand each of the following functions individually, but combined they're hurting my brain. Can you deconstruct the pointfree expression and explain it to me?

I'd like to introduce you to yet another way to organize a knowledge base in Emacs. This is the howm package by Kazuyuki Hiraoka. Package available on Melpa.
I've been using howm daily for a year and a half now, and I can confidently say that it is a simple and elegant solution for taking notes. Howm, much like "The Archive," utilizes links as a search trigger, among other similarities.
The package is almost 21 years old, but Hiraoka continues to actively support it. I've spent the past year creating a guide for howm, and I'm glad to show you what I've come up with.
The tutorial on howm is free and you can find it in English and Russian here:

 However, I'd like not to renounce (yet?) to the comfort of GUI mail clients (Thunderbird, Evolution, Geany, any is good for me...) in some situations. So the question: is there a way to make them share the same inbox, without having to download the mail twice?. Maybe with a separate process that fetches the emails, so that Gnus does not get stuck doing network operations.
 Additional info: My mail provider is Proton Mail. The question applies mainly to Linux systems. It would be useful to have a similar setup even using Emacs for Android - but I guess it's a chimera.

 Especially to those interested in various Emacs-based note-taking systems. 
 This year, my goal has been to make a guide on using the howm package.
 Some of you might already know about this wiki-like system created by Kazuyuki Hiraoka.
 The language barrier hase made it difficult for the howm package to reach a wider audience outside of Japan.
 I hope my humble contribution can somewhat address this situation, especially because howm really deserves more attention.

 One of the new features in the recent IntelliJ Scala Plugin release is the X-Ray editor mode. It displays hints next to your code without adding too much clutter, and only when you want it. Even though X-Ray was already mentioned in the release note, we - the IntelliJ Scala team - decided it's interesting enough to write about it a bit more.
 So, here's a blog post: https://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/2023/12/21/the-x-ray-mode/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Haskellers,
 I have a question about streaming libraries (streamly, conduit, streaming, etc.). I am trying to write a little application to remap user input events (keyboard, mouse, etc.) so I am dealing with low-volume, lazy streams. Additionally, the actual remapping will depend on a user configuration file. 
 I have gotten suggestions to use a streaming library to represent the basic datatype in my app, something I did look into but quickly abandoned because of a rather daunting amount of choice and considerations. However, now is the time for me to make a decision, since going back and refactoring everything after the fact is going to be a huge time-sink. So:
 I am currently under the impression that the biggest benefit of the streaming libraries is speed, and that that speed is generated by doing ghc-optimization tricks. I am also under the impression that speed is not that important in my domain, and that since I don't know which stream-transformations I will be composing at compile time (since I'll be reading the transformations from user-config), I wouldn't even be able to benefit from these performance gains.
 Is my understanding correct? Am I missing something? My home-rolled solution uses binary and a Chan and async to set up different event readers by parsing from lazy bytestrings, writing to the chan to merge the results, and then represents the input as a lazy, infinite list that then gets passed to my pure remapping engine. It seems to work fine. Am I setting myself up for some unforeseen disaster in the future? 
 The reason I've been avoiding these solutions is also just because my productive time is limited and very unreliable, so the cognitive overhead of a completely new set of abstractions comes with its own cost.
 Thank you for any advice you may proffer.

Yet none of them have really caught on with me, especially when it comes to practicality. I get that if some wrapper (List, Option, IO etc.) should be able to be called a Monad, it has to have some properties, and some laws that it should fulfill. But that still doesn't help me understand it really well, and I will forget the laws the next second and probably won't know how to implement or use a Monad in practicality. 
 Do you happen to have one golden source that made Monads 'click' for you both in what it is from a theoretical point of view, but also how to implement and use them? (Exercises would also be greatly appreciated, but I first need to understand it)

It's used for "ad hoc polymorphism" - how does this help with make a function pure and handle side effects, which I was told to be the focus of FP ? 
 And its implementation in Scala heavily relies on implicit keyword. After doing lots of implicits you can finally replace foo(bar) as bar.foo(). To me this just looks like a way of creating syntax sugar. How is it FP? 
 So I guess it's not FP by itself, but just a way to implement FP feature such as monads. Make sense?

 This is easy stuff but i don't understand how ys is concatenated with the first list. I understand that each character is broken down in the first and the recursion stops once xs is empty, but how does xs join with ys?
 ​
 Thanks :3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I was doing my research for an alternative to The Archive in Windows being unhappy with the mainstream options I found Denote. After working with the archive for 2 years and reading a bunch of times the Getting Started I can say this one ticks all of the boxes for me. Yes the downside is learning emacs, although maybe not A LOT of emacs and just what's necessary to feel comfortable with Denote. Also, it doesn't rely on org-mode so you don't need to also be familiar with how org mode works and just stay within emacs for your note taking needs. Another big win is that of course its free.
I'll leave a link to a video from the developer here.
What do you think about it?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started using Haskell as a replacement for Python, for "ad hoc computing". I guess, rather hope, I'll also write production programs in it some day, but for now I'm just enjoying this beautiful set of well thought out primitives that mathematicians and the countless people behind Haskell have laid at my hands (Thank you all!).
 Recently, GHC has started whining about using head. Now, I understand the motivations etc behind this (or I think I do), and I can see why in certain corporate settings, having a coding convention to disallow the use of head might be a totally appropriate thing to do.
 But I don't think such verboten-ness belongs to the language itself. Haskell is not a monoculture of non-partial programs, I feel it has a wider community than that. When I'm tinkering with stu…]]></summary>

My job is all walking and running, and since the injury happened on my own time, tough luck. Moved back in with the parents, so not to worry on the starving/freezing part. I have a decent local reputation in my industry, too, so long story short, this is just a very annoying setback. That's the bad news.
 Good news is that obviously, my schedule's freed up. Wanted to get back into reading forever, you can bet that's happening. And lots of things I've wanted to sink my teeth into, but never did for one reason or another. Two of them are emacs, and recreational math.
 My hope is that the reason I've never been able to sit down and work my way through the Petersen book was that I was just too sapped from work and life stuff. And apparently I got six months or so, so I'll have plenty of time to digest it. But. In case it turns out that I'm just lazy and weak, plan is to go through his beginners guide, and follow his advice of having a goal with emacs. I have two:
  
I want to learn how to do Bullet Journal-type of stuff. Make plans, write pieces for myself, that sort of thing. Heard that org-mode isn't any good for longer entries, though, so advice here would be appreciated.
 Something I can practice my math in. From taking notes, to copying out math problems and solving them, so on. I have no clue what this would look like, so again, advice appreciated.

 I'm not a developer but have worked around developers and with technology for decades. I thought I was pretty tech savvy before today.

I thought I'd enjoy the challenge of Emac's infamous learning curve and ascend that steep mountain with a cocky grin on my face and pride in my bones. 
 Then I installed the sucker. 
 From my Mac's Terminal via Homebrew, I might add. (Yes, yes, I was quite proud of my accomplishment when the program ran without a hitch.) I was able to swim smoothly through the Tutorial, thinking all the while, "THIS. Where has this been all my life??"

 I need to add scripting capabilities to one my software, i.e. give the user the possibility to write it's own "script" and have the program execute it. Ideally, being able to write such a script as an Haskell EDSL would have been great but I don't think it is possible (or easy). So before rolling out my own language, I was wandering what are the best options ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a condensed version of a problem I've encountered in a rewrite of a project to use associated types instead of multiparameter typeclasses. I want the type signatures in the API to be as clean as possible, and avoid the need for so many type ascriptions in code using the API, which is why I'd like to make this work somehow.
 I have a typeclass A with a non injective associated type Context
 class A a where type Context a 
 so many instances of A can have the same Context.
 Some instances of A are also instances of the class AA, that has two additional associated types, B and C.
 class (A a) => AA a where type B a type C a problematic :: Context a -> B a -> C a -> a 
 The intention is that given a Context, the combination of B a and C a uniquely identify a, but I don't know how to express this.
 I know it's possible to make constraints like
 class A a where type B a = b | b -> a 
 , but what I need is some kind of constraint with multiple parameters, like (Context a, B a, C a) -> a. How can this be achieved?

To calculate all the sums and formulas, I do org-table-iterate-buffer-tables, which works fine, but naturally takes a while.
 Could I exempt the older parts of the org file by adding the ARCHIVE tag to the old headings? Or does it only exempt them from agenda views and exporting, as it says in the org manual? It would be great if there were a function to exempt parts of a file when calling org-table-iterate-buffer-tables.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working my way through the exercises in "Function Programming in Scala, 2nd edition", and currently at chapter 11, Monad. The book defines its own Monad trait, and asks for some implementations. I want to verify that my implementations satisfy the Monad laws, so, I'm attempting to create some tests.
 Let me first show a test I wrote for testing Monoid left identity law.
 trait Monoid[A]: ... trait MonoidLaws { this: AnyFunSpec & ScalaCheckPropertyChecks => def leftIdentityLaw[A: Arbitrary: Monoid]: Unit = val instanceM = summon[Monoid[A]] 
 The tests are called as shown below:
 describe("Integers form a Monoid under addition"): import MonoidInstances.intAddition leftIdentityLaw[Int] rightIdentityLaw[Int] associativityLaw[Int] 
 Along the same lines, Monad and Monad laws:
 trait Functor[F[_]]: ... trait Monad[F[_]] extends Functor[F]: ... def leftIdentityLaw[A: Arbitrary, B: Arbitrary[A => F[B]]](using mA: Monad[F]): Unit = it("should satisfy the left identity law"): forAll { (x: A, f: A => F[B]) => mA.unit(x).flatMap(f) shouldBe f(x) } 
 However, the leftIdentityLaw test doesn't compile. What would be the corect type signature for it?
 Edit:
 After some trial and error, I found the a working solution, but I don't like it having an unused arbAToFB name.
 trait MonadLaws[F[_]] { this: AnyFunSpec & ScalaCheckPropertyChecks => def leftIdentityLaw[A: Arbitrary, B: Arbitrary](using arbAToFB: Arbitrary[A => F[B]], mA: Monad[F]): Unit = it("should satisfy the left identity law"): forAll { (x: A, f: A => F[B]) => mA.unit(x).flatMap(f) shouldBe f(x) }

 I just started trying org, org-roam, and org-roam-bibtex for my note-taking workflow, and I found them fantastic. However, I ran into one problem that I cannot customize them to open the corresponding paper pdf of any org-roam file using Google Chrome.
 What I want to achieve is that after pressing C-c C-o on the following ROAM_REFS, 
 https://preview.redd.it/jn4cx4qeha7c1.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=53bbf2a567aeb177afaa81f37124273c0d017337
 by pressing p in the following popup window, the pdf will be opened in Google Chrome.

 What I tried is to modify the variable org-file-apps, like below.
 https://preview.redd.it/b5d4n5oxha7c1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac1bb850b6a37a510dc88a127e7a450514fee13e
 What I observed is that now when I export my org-roam notes to pdf, e.g. pressing C-c C-e l o, it will be opened in Google Chrome. But when I press p in the popup window, the corresponding pdf of the original paper is still not opened in Google Chrome.
 How could I solve this? I appreciate any help you can provide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are things about data engineering I've really enjoyed, but after 2 years it has started to become quite stale and boring. The part of the job I have enjoyed the most is when I get to work with python and spark (the more software engineery stuff with data engineering). So given that scala is the language spark was written in, and what many data engineers had been using for a long time (and some still do), I decided it could be worthwhile learning.
 Also, I'd really like to transition into a more software engineering centric role in my next job, and have been learning Scala as a means by which to achieve this. My logic was that if I learn Scala the worst case scenario is that I get better at coding, (data engineering with python will only take you so far in terms of developing software engineering skills), and even though it is dying out as a language for DE in favour of python, it might help with employability for DE jobs. The upside is I may be able to get a Scala Developer/Engineer role that pays better, and which I may be better suited to and enjoy more.
 After reading a lot of posts on this subreddit, it seems people are growing increasingly pessimistic regarding the employability of scala, so I wanted some general advice regarding my approach. My current plan has been: Learn Scala -> Personal Projects -> Scala Data Engineer / Scala Engineer -> Scala Engineer/Developer. From what I have seen online Scala Engineer Jobs in my area (London) are very lucrative but I imagine there is a high barrier to entry, and worry that this transition isn't realistic.
 I'm currently working through the Scala RocktheJVM course and am enjoying what I have learnt so far, and will likely continue regardless. Any advice/thoughts would be much appreciated.

Swimming with Ideas
This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Please be courageous and add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
WikiLinks - how to format them, how to convert them from one format to another, why they are formatted the way they are.
Working with the garage door open.
How to get more than 3.8% of the zettelnauts who view this thread to post a quick response sharing their battles with note-taking. How's the ZK journey going for you?
How the transience of thought relates to international deep, geo, and aerospace industries.
The goals and structure of a revolving 'Continuous Review/Refactoring of Structure Notes"
Things I'm reading:
Calvino, Italo. The path to the spiders' nests. 1947.
Garmus, Bonnie. Lessons in chemistry. 2022.
Parrish, Shane. Clear thinking: turning ordinary moments into extraordinary results. 2023.
Sencea and Gioia, Dana. Sentences from Seneca. 2023.
Music I'm listening to:
Peter Pearson
Jeff Oster
Emancipator
lofi beats

The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a recurring issue for me when I do Advent of Code, which I do in Haskell - some problems are really suited for using memoization. I tried to condense my confusion to as close to the pain point as possible, and I am hoping someone here can help me understand where my thinking goes wrong. Here is a code block with a few different ways of calculating a Fibonacci sequence:
 import Data.Function.Memoize main :: IO () main = do -- slow print $ fib 35 -- fast print $ fibMemo 35 -- slow print $ (memoize fibMemo2) 35 fib :: Int -> Int fib 0 = 1 fib 1 = 1 fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2) fibMemo :: Int -> Int fibMemo = memoize fib' where fib' 0 = 1 fib' 1 = 1 fib' n = fibMemo (n-1) + fibMemo (n-2) fibMemo2 :: Int -> Int fibMemo2 0 = 1 fibMemo2 1 = 1 fibMemo2 n = (memoize fibMemo2) (n-1) + (memoize fibMemo2) (n-2) 
 Note here that two functions are really slow - both the first and last one. But in my mind, the second one (which is fast) is exactly the same as the third one (which is slow). What is the difference here? Both of them recursively call memoize on themselves, which tells me I am missing something critical.

For the past several years, I’ve been primarily using and writing notes on my laptop. When I needed to access these notes on the go, I used 1Writer. I treated this as a read-only exercise. I didn’t really trust the syncing, and so I would use Drafts to jot down something that I wanted to add to my notes later. 1Writer was initially terrible for searching 10,000 files, and so made even read-only access somewhat pointless. However, a note to the developer improved things significantly, and then learning to sort by title rather than by other attributes, made 10,000 notes workable. Still, this was always going to be my last resort platform.

I don't really like Evernote's aggressive in-app marketing, and I'd like to find an open-source alternative that integrates to some extent with orgmode. I'm sure there is such a thing? Or, even without a direct integration, what is a good Evernote alternative that I can export orgmode to through, say, Pandoc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm doing monoids from CIS 194. Below are functions/data I will talk about: ``` {- For learning purpose I have rewritten Monoid to Monoid' and mempty with mappend to mempty' and mappend' -}
 newtype Product a = Product {getProduct' :: Integer} deriving (Show, Ord, Eq, Num)
 instance Num a => Monoid' (Product a) where mempty' = Product 1 mappend' = (*)
 getProduct :: Product Integer -> Integer getProduct (Product x) = x
 prod :: [Integer] -> Integer prod = getProduct' . mconcat' . map Product ``` Now the problem I have is, if I use getProduct' from record syntax, I have error in prod function "Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘mconcat'’ prevents the constraint ‘(Monoid' (Product a0))’ from being solved." but If I use getProduct, that is function defined under Product, everything works. Why is it like that, is record syntax is hiding something from me?
 EDIT: Added Monoid' (Product a) instance on comment request.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I wrote a quick minesweeper clone in scala.js w/ laminar to test them out. Website is here, code here.
 Besides the code not being the cleanest (beginner programmer – all advice welcome), there's one bug I haven't been able to crush: on Firefox you can accidentally right-click a cleared square and get a context menu popup. This is not desirable, as it at best slows you down and at worst leads to accidentally leaving the page via said menu.
 Relevant code from Main.scala:
 dom.document.addEventListener("contextmenu", e => e.preventDefault()) 
 On Chromium things work as expected – no context menu anywhere, ever.
 What I've tried:
  
onContextMenu --> { e => e.preventDefault() } literally everywhere: buttons, tbody, table etc.
 onContextMenu --> { e => println("here") } similarly everywhere to find out that when right-clicking a disabled button, nothing on the page seems to receive the pointer event, meaning there's nothing to block it, which then leads to Firefox opening the context menu
 pointer-events: none; for disabled buttons, which breaks things on (at least some) mobile browsers since the browser thinks that a tap on a disabled button was "really" meant for its neighbour, which is... not good!
  
So, is this something that needs to be fixed in Firefox, or am I missing something obvious?
 Thanks.
 edit. This is a Firefox bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1543196 
 Minimal reproducible example for this particular case just because:
 <!DOCTYPE html> <head> <style> body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 100vh; } </style> </head> <body oncontextmenu="return false;"> <button>No context menu</button> <button disabled="true">Context menu :(</button> </body> </html>

 I watched a video by Alexis king about laziness but I don’t have patience for videos so didn’t finish it.
 Can you please give me an idea of what benefits laziness brings to Haskell? And can you share of a paper or a good blog post that talks about this? Thanks

 When org-footnote-section set to nil, footnotes will be placed locally in each headline, but footnote numbers are shared between all headline(, which means I can't have two headlines use the same number, says [fn:1]), 
 and the exported html file collect all footnotes together again(, which I don't want).
 So, does it possible that every entry/headline has it's own footnote number?

It's not about intelligence, but rather standing on the shoulders of giants—open source maintainers, content creators, the Scala Centre, EPFL and everyone that makes this community welcoming for people like me.
 I want to express my sincere appreciation to the entire ecosystem and the individuals who contribute to it. Scala changed my life for the better and for all the trash it gets sometimes, it made me fall in love with programming again, and it is great to get paid for something you would do for free either way.
 Amidst the ups and downs, Scala has been a source of inspiration, reminding me of the joy of playing with math and computers for a living. Thanks to everyone who makes this possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there!
 I have recently made the switch from Obsidian to Emacs Org-mode, and it's been a delight. Yet, I found one important issue that keeps bugging me: 
 I tried to install org-roam from MELPA, which caused my org to be automatically updated from my current version (9.3) to the more recent one (9.6). 
 The problem is, whenever this happens, I lose all my configurations, together with functionality of org-mode, web-mode and other stuff I've installed. Instead, I am greeted by this: (invalid-function org-assert-version), and a message saying there was a problem in loading the configuration file. Running Emacs --debug-init on the terminal would create a long list of errors. The only way to solve this is by going into my ~/.emacs.d/elpa/ directory and manually removing the files for the updated org mode version.
 For reference, all my configurations are in a ~/.emacs document.
 How can I update org-mode without loosing all my configs?
 Thanks a lot!
 P.S. I'm fairly new to programming and Emacs, sorry if this was not properly oriented or if there is information missing.

Equivalence problems with StreamGraph by Jonathan Dowland
The StrIoT Logical Optimiser applies a set of rewrite rules to a stream-processing program, generating a set of variants that can be reasoned about, ranked, and deployed. The problem I’ve been tackling is that a variant may appear to be semantically equivalent to another, but compare (with ==) as distinct.

        <updated>2023-12-13T22:51:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
I come to you, specialists and sages of the Zettelkasten, in a quest to understand something I cannot wrap my head around… 
I've read How to Take Smart Notes, I've practiced the method successfully for writing fiction, but there is something I cannot yet figure (or maybe need validation to implement?).
How do you manage that which you know you do not know, or do not know enough, or realize you did not know? That is:
How do you manage questions, which can be ongoing on life? ("How to be a good man in the 21st Century?")
How do you navigate and evolve forming practices? (Like: the Zettelkasten method, which you hone in through practice, and evolve insight: "this works for me, I should pay attention to that")
How do you walk back on ideas that do not serve you anymore, or that you realize were false? (like an early 20st Century scientist witnessing the ether being disproved, meaning all theories and constructs pertaining to it become completely irrelevant apart from scientific history)
I guess the underlying issue is "transient" content, which is a little bit at odds with the concept of permanent / evergreen note / Zettel. Now I know a Zettelkasten is personal, that truth is unattainable and everything is potentially transient – please bear with me here 🙂 I also know, in Luhmann's words, that the Zettelkasten is a "septic tank".
And yet. What would be best practices for capturing accruing, unformed ideas and questions, which would free the user by knowing they will not pollute the system down the road if they turn out to be dead ends?
Is it a simple matter of trusting that linking will isolate irrelevant content? Or should you prune links later, remove notes – but potentially destroying the path of thinking that led you to where you are now? Is it a much simpler matter of redirecting the energy of the system simply by altering the geometry of structure notes?
Any insight and especially technical approaches would be hugely appreciated. Thank you!]]></summary>

I did found some sty files, but all of them have multiline definitions, so I cannot just put a #+LATEX_HEADER: behind every line. neither can I just make a macro and deal with it manually as it is more than 1000 lines long.
 Is there a way to use it directly or any convenient way to change it? Any other way to write proof trees would also work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey
 I've working for the past couple of days on a tree-sitter based major mode for TLA+.
 From Wikipedia
  
TLA+ is a formal specification language developed by Leslie Lamport [the La of Latex] It is used for designing, modelling, documentation, and verification of programs, especially concurrent systems and distributed systems. 
  
And PlusCal 
  
PlusCal (formerly called +CAL) is a formal specification language, which transpiles to TLA+. PlusCal most resembles an imperative programming language
  
The mode offers syntax highlighting for most TLA+ / PlusCal Syntax, and basic imenu navigation. Code formatting is work in progress (TLA+ having significant indendation is in my point of view a significant challenge).
 Any feedback is welcome.
 The work is inspired by tla-mode, and this page  has been an invaluable help.
 PS. No idea how advent of code submission work here, so feel free to edit the title to use as as submission if it makes sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of curiosity, has anyone gotten the pdf-tools package work in Windows (specifically 10)? I've found a few options:
  
Trying to build with msys2 -- doesn't seem to like my msys2 configuration from Chocolatey. At the very least, it won't install and run make successfully.
 Tried out a precompiled pdf-tools -- this is about 5-6 years old at this date, and while there's libraries, and I added it to load-path and brought it in with require, it still was not particularly happy. It acted as if it'd never been properly installed.
  
Just curious. The baked in DocView is adequate for my needs as if I were to print it properly, I'd use a full PDF viewer like Sumatra. However DocView is pretty grainy in rendering and my eyes would appreciate it if I found a slightly better solution.
 I'm editing Typst documents with live PDF update, so it's nice to have another pane with the rendered document on the fly (mostly -- it's not the live update their website Rust app has, but it's close enough for me for now.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I am an IT student, and was given the task to install Leancheck. I managed to do that by following the instructions on: https://github.com/rudymatela/leancheck/blob/master/README.md
 Now it works if I do "ghci" and then "import Test.LeanCheck". 
 My problem arrised when I tried to do "stack ghci", which also is required by my professor. Typing "stack ghci" opens ghci, with the following message: 
 PS /filePath/> stack ghci
 ​
 Note: No local targets specified, so a plain ghci will be started with no package hiding or package options.
 ​
 You are using snapshot: lts-21.24
 ​
 If you want to use package hiding and options, then you can try one of the following:
 ​
 * If you want to start a different project configuration
 than /filePath/\stack\global-project\stack.yaml, then you can use stack init to create a new
 stack.yaml for the packages in the current directory.
 ​
 * If you want to use the project configuration
 at /filePath/\stack\global-project\stack.yaml, then you can add to its 'packages' field.
 ​
 Configuring GHCi with the following packages:
 GHCi, version 9.4.8: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/ :? for help
 Loaded GHCi configuration from /filePath/\stack\ghci-script\2a3bbd58\ghci-script
 ghci>
 Typing "import Tests.Leancheck" results in: 
 <no location info>: error:
 Could not find module `Tests.Leancheck'
 It is not a module in the current program, or in any known package. 
 ​
 my stack.yaml file: 
 packages: []
 extra-deps:
 - leancheck-1.0.0
 resolver: lts-21.24 
 My config.yaml file is fully standard.
 ​
 I have to get the imports to work on a global basis. So I should be able to cd into anny directory, start "stack ghci" and then be abl to use "import Tests.Leancheck". 
 Thanks for the help fellow IT wizards :)

That way my notes look visually appealing. But currently I have not found a way to do this in org-mode. Is this a futile cause and impossible?
 For example, I want to center the two images or place the two images side-by-side in the following note:
 https://preview.redd.it/9tyh172cel5c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=74582a8bd4f76c2f37f2ef30314bae0181bb41e2
 EDIT: Is this kind of feature not generally desired in the emacs community? I thought anyone who takes notes and organizes things in org-mode would have value in having this option. Or maybe it is too much of a headache?

 Hiya! Mainly been a lurker here (also just a lurker in general) during my emacs journey the past few months.
 Hurl is a cli tool for sending HTTP requests (using cURL under the hood) in plain text format similar to https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el but can be used outside emacs and also has some additional testing utilities built in. For more info see the hurl home page: https://hurl.dev/ 
 Hurl does have an emacs mode included but I wanted a few more features than what was already provided like graphql/json fontification, so I gave my own shot at trying to create a major mode as well as an exercise to learning more elisp.
 Thought I'd open up a new repo for this so I can incorporate any feedback from the community faster and then maybe see if I can incorporate this into the main hurl repo.
 Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've switched from vim to emacs recently with evil mode. It's been a great experience so far however, I'm facing an issue with js2-mode syntax highlighting. I appreciate that web-mode is designed for mixed syntax files, if you're say working with templates for front-end web-dev, however I have found it provides far superior syntax highlighting than js2-mode. I haven't noticed any other difference between js2-mode and web-mode apart from this, I guess I've only scratched the surface. I primarily work with js and json files for node.js back-end development and only touch front-end, where I guess web-mode would be excellent a minority of the time. The error highlighting seems to be same for both, driven by lsp-mode. I haven't touched ESlint yet (been using ts-ls so far), only just installed it.
 I guess my questions boil down to:
 Why should I use 1 over the other especially given the syntax highlighting preference?
 How does flycheck / flymake play into this, what are the differences?
 Is it fine to run 2 language servers for lsp-mode / how does that work? Using lsp-describe-session shows both of them running?
 As a side-note does anyone have a config with lsp-ui and peek that they're willing share for some inspiration / things I've missed.
 I also have tern running is this required?
 Thank you in advance.

 He goes on to add that some of his complaints are hyperbole and goes on to create his own fork of Emacs - for real?
 Then all hell breaks loose here and on HN
 Come on guys, there is war in Palestine with thousands dying a more to come, some earthquakes occurring here and there, climate crises, chronic hunger, starvation and what nots in many parts of the world.
 Try to maintain some perspective.
 Do some people know what hyperbole means? Have they never bothered to look it up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I just finished a computational physics class at university. They used Python. We had a browser based program that used a VM to store our files, and we edited everything on jupyter notebook. I basically had everything setup for me in the class at school. I didn't initialize or setup any of the programs.
 ​
 The class inspired me to try and code more here at home, I just got a book, Learning Physics with Functional Programming. They use Haskell as the language. I've got a macbook, and I have no idea how to set anything up. I barely understand what I'm doing. Believe me I've been watching tutorial after tutorial, but there's always some error I get that these tutorials don't address. I'm trying to become code literate.
 ​
 In that case I thought maybe I could get help here? I went to Haskell.org, and used the terminal command from there to install GHcup. Afterwards, I opened up VScode and downloaded the Haskell extension. Then, I tried to start a new project and begin working along the book I bought. 
 The problem is that anytime I set Haskell as my language for a new note in VScode, it gives the error that "Project requires GHcup but it isn't installed. Source: Haskell (extension)"
 ​
 I've tried going into my ~bash file to inspect the path of the GHcup file, but the terminal denies me access to it. I'm not even sure if that's what would help fix this either, but I saw a lot of reference to this on Haskell Troubleshooting forum links from VScode.
 ​
 Sorry for my incapability... this kinda makes me want to keep using my whiteboard for physics but I really want to be able to do bigger calculations on a computer, and not on Python.
 ​
 If I could get any help I'd appreciate it a lot

I've been really busy, and emacs have been nothing but trouble, debugging and configuration. It just stopped me from working efficiently. I finally understood what people mean by "Don't let your editor get in your way". It just stopped me from learning this new technology, and had me configuring and finding good packages that allow me to program with it in emacs, and occasionally debugging the previously installed packages like lsp, because either the autocompletion box doesn't show up, or lsp just spits some errors and shuts down.
 Then I used vscode, and wow! Everything just worked and I didn't need to config anything. But vscode is a pain too. It's not foss, and you have to use your mouse a lot.
 My rant is finished. Do you have any advice/roast for me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: I managed to fix it by changing after-init-hook to after-init. Can someone just explain why that is?
 I am trying to set up company and can't get it to autoload with use-package. Here is what I have based on the company docs:
  (use-package company :ensure t :hook (after-init-hook . global-company-mode)) 
 This does not seem to enable company mode. 
 I tried adding :config (global-company-mode 1) which seemingly did nothing. In either case, if I C-x C-e I see global-company-mode at the bottom of my screen, but C-h m shows that it is not enabled.
 If I run M-x global-company-mode it shows that global company mode is disabled. If I run it again, it says that it's enabled and I can confirm it is working.
 What am I missing here?

 How exactly do I get a Haskell job? I’m in the US. No professional experience so I’m entry level.
 What backend web framework should I learn? Yesod or servant? Or snap? Or some other one?
 And what do I need to know?
 I’ve implemented a linear algebra library in Haskell with a servant api. But I want to invest some time into Haskell to get a job.

It was meant to be tongue-in-cheek, but karma has it that this mind virus has now caught hold of my thoughts. Not the fork part of course, but definitely the STM part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know one way to do this, but hoping there's something simpler or more general. clangd (C++ LSP server) is over-aggressive about adding "helpful" #includes during completion. The way to turn that off is to pass -header-insertion=never on its cmd line.
 In eglot with recent trunk emacs, the C-related modes are configured by default like this, in eglot-server-programs:  ((c-mode c-ts-mode c++-mode c++-ts-mode) . ,(eglot-alternatives '("clangd" "ccls"))) 
 So I could splice that out and replace it, for sure. But then I lose the alternative of using ccls if that's what's installed, and it seems fragile with all the ts- stuff happening these days. So my question is, is there a way to configure eglot to say "when invoking clangd, always pass -header-insertion=never? And if not, would that be a useful addition? (Maybe a filter function to process the results of eglot--guess-contact?)

Judging by popularity, my most useful packages are:
  
devdocs.el: Documentation reader with quick and handy lookup commands. It is similar to the built-in Info reader, but has a different (likely larger) document coverage.
 code-cells: Utilities to work with “lightweight notebooks”, that is, source code which is split into cells by special %% comments. Also allows you to transparently edit Jupyter notebook (ipynb) files.
  
Combined with the above, these two packages can help setting up a nice Python editing environment (although there's nothing Python-specific about them):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/emacs. I've been using Emacs for a few years now but please, treat me as a total beginner!
 Magit is one of the most incredible tools available but it is frustratingly slow on big git repos, especially when they're located on a slow file system. I very often find myself giving 2-3 commands in a row and only seeing the output in a few seconds.
 E.g. I'd type (1) f u to fetch all, then (2) r e to trigger rebase elsewhere and then start typing (3) /mast so the counsel wrapper can find origin/master and then I press Enter. I basically do all steps (1)-(3) and will only see any output >5s later.
 This definitely breaks the workflow and I would at least expect Emacs not to freeze between inputs (1), (2) and (3) and just give me clues that there's a process running in background.
 Is it something possible or should I try to use some optimisation tricks to do less on every magit operation?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a followup post for https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/14dej62/please_help_collecting_statistics_to_optimize/
 Thanks everyone who submitted the data!
 I have now summarized everything. You can find the analysis in my EmacsConf2023 presentation - https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/gc/ and https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10213384 (reproducible analysis).
 The key takeaways from the above analysis:
 For users:
  
Emacs freezes due to GC are real
 … but not for all users
 When GC does get Emacs slower, it is either 
 slow startup ⇒ increase gc-cons-threshold to 20-80Mb check gc-elapsed after startup
 slow and frequent GC ⇒ increase gc-cons-percetage to 0.2-1.0 but watch Emacs RAM usage
 
  
For Emacs devs:
  
GC problem is very real for many users (9% of GCs are both frequent and slow)
 It is worth bumping gc-cons-threshold temporarily during startup
 Ideally, we should switch from Mark&Sweep to something more performant
 May increase gc-cons-percetage, but need to get user data for optimal numbers
  
Further plans:
  
With the collected data we can hopefully continue emacs-devel discussion on changing GC defaults and get somewhere. https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/20230310110747.4hytasakomvdyf7i@Ergus/
 
emacs-gc-stats package has now served its purpose, but I think that it might still be useful for people who want to toy around GC settings. I plan to add some kind of "session summary" command that will display the key statistics of current user session. It should help understanding the effects of GC customization on the performance.

 This little minor mode will switch between two themes (usually dark and light) at sunset/sunrise or at user specified time. It will also switch you system theme.

 I wrote this package because I didn't know circadian.el existed.

 BTW I'm not a programmer and know very little about elisp.

And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
I have been contemplating the concept of intelligence density and its implications. My focus has been on my own intellectual capacity and how to make improvements. I have noticed a significant lack of intellectual richness in what little media I'm exposed to.
A note requires a UUID, but the need to have it in the filename is unclear. Is this just forced on us because of a past nostalgic habit?
My productivity is negatively impacted by a decline in focus in the evening hours. I plan to implement a new routine scheduled for 8:00 PM to steer my performance consciously. We'll see if this approach is successful.
I'm done with Air Quality, Pollution & Smoke GEOL454, onto Young Adult Literature EDCI445 university class. I have a short winter break in which to focus on programming and woodworking.
Things I'm reading: all fiction for a change.
Difficult loves. Calvino, Italo. 1970. - Relationships
Heartburn. Ephron, Nora. 1983. - Food/relationship Fiction
The path to the spiders' nests. Calvino, Italo. 1947. - WW2 Youth Literature
Lessons in chemistry. Garmus, Bonnie. 2022. - Humor
Music I'm listening to:
Adele
Tone Ranger

The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Error: The title should be Do Emacs regular expression libraries have the ability to create named abbreviations? 
 This what I mean by abbreviations the actual terminology may be different,eg.
 [[:alnum:]], [[:upper:]], [[:space:]], [[:xdigit:]] etc, to show some of the ones at regex101.com.
 Recreating the exact sequences I use for my own purposes can be difficult, so I would like to extend these kind of abbreviationss with some of my own sequences, ie give them a short name which is recompiled into the rx library.
 Does the rx library and any others have such features?
 UPDATE:
 I just noticed an rx-extra macro at Emacs Wiki: rx which has such a feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's create an Emacs Advent calendar! It would be nice if for every day till Christmas someone takes the opportunity to showcase their Emacs work. It will be interesting to see what you are all working on.
  
I swear it was December 7 when I started writing this post. :)
 By far my three most popular packages are:
  
orderless. A highly configurable completion style that matches multiple patterns in any order against minibuffer completion candidates.
 embark. The one I always struggle to explain, so instead go read u/karthink's wonderful blog post about it! Prodded by u/minad-emacs, I just released version 1.0! 🎉 
 marginalia. Informative annotations for minibuffer completion candidates, co-written with u/minad-emacs.
  
Packages I haven't put on MELPA or GNU ELPA, but I know some people use:
  
math-delimiters. Provides a nice command to insert LaTeX math delimiters and to toggle between inline and display versions of them.
 placeholder. On the fly ephemeral snippets: need to send a bunch of similar emails just this once so you don't want to bother making a skeleton, tempo or yasnippet template for them? Use placeholder!
 epithet. Give descriptive names to buffers.
  
Tiny, tiny packages in my personal configuration that I think someone may want to steal:
  
block-undo. Have keyboard macros undo in a single step (something vi gets right!).
 ffap-eshell. Make ffap correctly guess in more cases the directory containing a file name you find in an eshell buffer.
 shr-heading. Navigate between headings in an eww buffer (or more generally, shr buffer), also enables imenu.
 eval-region-advice. Advise evaluation commands to evaluate the region if active.
  
Finally, something useless which I've found fun (but haven't grown as much as I thought I would):
  
luggage. A Largely Undesired Gadget: a Generative Art Gallery for Emacs.
  
Previous advent calendar days: day 6, day 5, day 4, day 3, day 2, day 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For work, I sometimes need to forward emails I receive in HTML format, and I need the forwarded email to include the original HTML format. Do folks have a way to do this in mu4e they could share? 
 I can, using org-mime, compose HTML emails if I need to. I also can view HTML emails using xwidgets. And I can attach the HTML email to an outgoing message using mu4e-action-capture-message and mu4e-compose-attach-captured-message. But is there a way to make the HTML content of the original email so that it's rendered inline as it were? (Sorry, I'm not sure I got the terminology right here...)
 I tried looking at the raw message I capture with mu4e-action-capture-message, thinking I might be able to (a) open that file, (b) find the HTML content I need, and (c) insert it as an html part. But I didn't have much luck. (For one thing, the HTML bit of the raw email doesn't render the same as the original one somehow.) 
 I'm close to a sort of working solution, by just replacing disposition=attachment with disposition=inline in the output of calling mu4e-compose-attach-captured-message. But I feel like I don't quite understand what I'm doing and would appreciate any pointers or suggestions.
 (I've searched around and found a few discussions of issues related to this, but nothing there seemed to help with my particular issue---there's an issue at the mu repo which prompted me to use the capture+attach workflow I mentioned above, but that's the closest I've got to an answer so far...)

The Scala Days talk on YouTube.
 A Hello World project made by Alvin Alexander.
 A mill-scala-hello Gitter template.
 The ScalaCon talk on YouTube.
  
I had filed a GitHub ticket, but it was closed as "out of scope". I'm not sure why the maintainers insisted on perpetuating the ambiguity, and would like to know your opinion about the following. None of the references above answer these very basic and very important questions.
  
A recommended single-module project structure including unit tests and a non-default package (i.e. files not directly under src). The assumption is that a multi-module project is simply a collection of several single-module (potentially interdependent) projects.
 Separation of Java and Scala source code in a mixed project.
 Separation of unit and integration tests in a multi-module project.
 Separation of main and test resources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just recently, GNU Emacs maintainer Stefan Kangas mentioned in his talk on Emacsconf 2023 that contributions to the Tree-Sitter based modes are very welcome and much appreciated. I agree with this very much.
 Built-in and external JS-related modes
 JS-related modes built into Emacs core:
  
js-mode
 js-jsx-mode
 js-ts-mode
 typescript-ts-mode
 tsx-ts-mode
  
External modes that replace and/or build on core modes:
  
js2-mode: https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode
 rjsx-mode: https://github.com/felipeochoa/rjsx-mode
 js3-mode: https://github.com/tamzinblake/js3-mode
 web-mode: https://web-mode.org/
 jtsx: https://github.com/llemaitre19/jtsx
 tsx-mode: https://github.com/orzechowskid/tsx-mode.el
 ultimate-js-mode: https://github.com/guillaumebrunerie/ultimate-js-mode
  
An external minor mode: https://codeberg.org/ckruse/tsx-ts-helper-mode
 Request to Contribute to Emacs Core
 Instead of splitting our efforts, let's bundle our resources and make Emacs core better. I appeal to all external JS-related package maintainers to contribute parts of their packages to Emacs core. Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Install GnuGP version 2.4.1. or higher.
 
From the command line, symmetrically encrypt a test file.
 $ echo 'test' > test.txt $ gpg --symmetric test.txt
 
Open the file encrypted file, test.txt.gpg in Emacs version 29 or higher. You should be prompted for the passphrase you used to encrypt the file in the previous step.
 
Edit the file.
 
M-x toggle-debug-on-quit
 
Save the file. Emacs will hang. C-g to quit. You will see a backtrace which indicates Emacs was stuck in a loop inside epg-wait-for-status.
 
Execute the following well-intentioned advice found scattered throughout unofficial Emacs support channels:
 (fset 'epg-wait-for-status 'ignore)
 
Save the file again! Horay! It saved!
 
You now have a corrupt symmetrically encrypted file! Try decrypting it!
 $ gpg --decrypt test.txt.gpg
 
Now you don't ever have to worry about the file again! Remember to do this to your backups if you'd like to corrupt those as well.
 
 The real solution is to downgrade GnuPG. DO NOT USE (fset 'epg-wait-for-status 'ignore)! It's the equivalent of blowing through a stop sign and hoping your car doesn't get hit.

Currently, I find it very annoying to use readSTRef, writeSTRef, modifySTRef, and all the monad functions. It would be nice to have a "lifted" function that could accept values of 'ST s a', 'STRef s a', and 'a' and return the result 'ST s b'.
 Is there a package that already accomplishes this? If not, it would be nice to have a helper lift function that allows something like
 lift :: (a -> b) -> m -> ST s b lift' :: (a -> b -> c) -> m -> n -> ST s c -- example lifted functions not' = lift not (^>^) = lift' (>) 
 I have tried couple of implementations for lift but have not been successful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although I have been studying functional programming in Haskell (and Agda) as part of my university course for over a year now, and we’ve covered the basics and more advanced topics like monads, states, writing interpreters etc., I’d like to start from scratch to revise and strengthen my knowledge, thus I composed a list of books to do so.
 Stage 1: Basics - Programming in Haskell
 Stage 2: Advanced topics - Real World Haskell - Haskell in Depth
 Stage 3: Specialised topics - Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell - Functional Design and Architecture (early-access)
 To those who have read some (or perhaps all) of these books, would you recommend them in this order? Individual book opinions are welcomed too, or if you think I should take a look at another, non-mentioned book, feel free to share!
 Thank you in advance!
 PS: I am familiar with the book ‘Haskell Programming from First Principle’, which AFAIK covers not just the basics, but advanced topics as well. My only issue with it, and consequently the reason why it is not on the list, is that it has no physical edition available anymore, and I’d like to stick with those books that have one. About ‘Learn You a Haskell for Good!’; it had some rather poor reviews on the sub so I ditched it. ‘Programming in Haskell’ seems more professional and serious anyways. But if you’ve read both of them, do tell your experience.

 I'm using vscode with haskell plugin and it's driving me mad.
 It seems to be working every now and then, or with some features seemingly broken, or it's behavior doesn't reflect the latest change.
 Also in the extension output it generates a lot of errors, and I have no ideas if that's normal.
 I don't even know it is supposed to work. How can I know that whether it's really working properly, all the time, with every feature working?
 For example, how can I jump to functions defined in src/Lib.sh from reference in App/Main.hs? In other languages I just use ctrl+] (I'm using vim plugin).
 And suppose I want to use Data.ByteString.Base64.encode, is there supposed to be a shortcut to import it, instead of manually typing the statement?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks in advance for the help!
 I have a couple very long org files that are essentially dumping grounds for notes for large projects. I'd like to refactor them into smaller files in subfolders. One, for example, is for a book project, and there are characters, scenes, background notes, etc., and it would be much nicer to break it up into many files. However, when doing this, I want to be able to quickly find all the files relevant to a specific topic, even if they aren't currently open.
 I don't see a way that searching by tags or similar looks for files that are not currently open in a buffer.
 I've been using org-roam more and more these days, mostly because finding notes in it is easier. One solution might be to simply convert 100% of my org files over to org-roam and essentially use org-roam as a search / file open tool.
 But is there a way in more "pure" org-mode to quickly search through a whole mess of files and bring up only the ones with specific tags?

 I am trying to be able to edit or view org files in the Google drive mobile app. 
 My set up is a folder synced with rclone to Google drive. But the problem is that the mime type of org files is inode and not txt. So I think if I tell rclone to sync and set the .org files mine type to txt, that can work.
 If you have any better solution or the method on changing the mime type of org files to txt, I am all ears. Looks like Google drive is horrible in Linux. 
 All in all, thank you for your time!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Haskellers,
 I've been struggling with some really weird behavior for the last few hours now and I can't seem to figure it out, maybe that someone here can help? I've narrow the actual problem down to 2 very stripped down scenarios, 1 that works, and 1 that doesn't. Both are being run in exactly the same simple IO function that just grabs a lazy bytestring that is being generated from an evdev file and feeds it to the function and tries to print the result.
 works :: L.ByteString -> [ByteString] works = L.foldrChunks chomp [] where chomp b acc = b : acc doesnot :: L.ByteString -> [ByteString] doesnot = fst . L.foldrChunks chomp ([], []) where chomp b (acc, bcc) = (b : acc, b : bcc) test :: IO () test = do withEvdev "/dev/input/by-id/usb-Technomancy_Atreus-event-kbd" $ \byts -> do mapM_ print $ works byts -- mapM_ print $ doesnot byts 
 The first function works as expected, it returns a lazy list of strict bytestrings that accumulate as keyboard events are generated. And the testing function prints out data as it comes in. The second function simply will not ever run. I've covered it with trace statements and changed the accumulator to undefineds and the pattern matches to underscores. Doesn't change anything. Somehow changing the accumulator to a tuple seems to turn the whole handling of the loop strict?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can somebody help me with this: I'm trying to bolt sbt-native-packager onto an existing project. The instructions make it seem easy, just add this to the plugins.sbt file:
 addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-native-packager" % "1.9.16")
 ...and then add some configuration to build.sbt
 I'm failing at the first step. I get this error when trying to sbt reload:
 [error] (update) sbt.librarymanagement.ResolveException: Error downloading com.typesafe.sbt:sbt-native-packager;sbtVersion=1.0;scalaVersion=2.12:1.9.16
 I'm actually using Scala 3.3.1 , so why is it picking up the packager for a much older version of the language? And this seems pretty suss... the MVN Central page for SBT Native Packager:
 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.sbt/sbt-native-packager_2.12_1.0
 Seems to have a version that might also correspond to an old version of Scala. What am I misunderstanding here? Can I not use Scala 3 with this packaging tool?

 ​
 I use Gnus for pretty simple stuff for centralising 5 mails and, 2 more to come, I know that Gmail and outlook work without issue, and I've fixed some notifications issue in MacOS, since growlnotify is not working in my latest MacOS version.
 ​
 For the two more two go, I will be implementing in one of them Outlook, in which I wonder if you guys have any configuration I can take a look at, since I haven't done anything regarding outlook and posts about it seem to be pretty old. Perhaps it may just be the simple 'get an application password' like Email.
 ​
 Aside from that, I have pretty simple mail sending capabilities and no contacts support, so I only use it to reply and, have posting styles so I always reply to the email I got the email from.
 ​
 Another thing I would also love to fix is that, I'm using gnus-demon-add-handler 'gnus-demon-scan-news to scan for mail every x minutes, which blocks Emacs since, I have gnus open all the time, but knowing that some emails I could get are critical I do need it all the day, aside that I would be working and, having some mini blocks is annoying.
 ​
 Thank you, I would love to hear if anyone uses Gnus extensively!.

 TLDR. Gnus Configurations and improvements

☝️ Following u/minad-emacs' cue, here's some stuff I've worked on.
 "Apps" for Emacs:
  
elfeed-tube: Youtube integration for Elfeed -- "live" transcripts, imenu support and more for Youtube subscriptions.
 wombag: A Wallabag client for Emacs. Wallabag is a read-it-later service.
 gptel: An LLM chat client for Emacs, supports ChatGPT and local LLMs (via Ollama, GPT4All or llama.cpp)
  
Packages that make using Emacs more convenient:
  
popper: Summon, dismiss or cycle through "popup" buffers. Like drop-down terminals (guake, yakuake etc) but in Emacs and for any buffer, not just shel…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm having an issue with find-file and tramp. When I initially connect to a server over tramp, then attempt to open up a local file the host and username are always prepended to the file path and I can't delete them. For example the file path will look like
 Find-file: /ssh:host: path/to/file
 and the furthest I can go back is
 Find-file:/ssh:host:
 I've attempted to type in ~ and // as suggested in another reddit post, however, this just takes me back to the home directory on the remote.
 Is there any way to remove the host info from the beginning of the file path?
 ​
 Edit: The issue seems to be with ivy and the way it alters the "completing-read-function" as mentioned here https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/45929/disable-ivy-for-find-file , this is enough of a reason for me to try vertico instead.

 I have forked and cloned GHC onto my machine. I was able, after correcting a few problems, build GHC using ./boot && ./configure and hadrian/build -j as instructed in the README.
 But when I try to run the tests (hadrian/build test), the compiler is failing. It is failing despite the fact that I have not made any changes to it whatsoever. I have attached the build-summary results.
 SUMMARY for test run started at Tue Dec 5 18:26:56 2023 1:31:28.360659 spent to go through 9836 total tests, which gave rise to 48054 test cases, of which 38037 were skipped 0 had missing libraries 9880 expected passes 106 expected failures 0 caused framework failures 0 caused framework warnings 0 unexpected passes 2 unexpected failures 0 unexpected stat failures 29 fragile tests Unexpected failures: /tmp/ghctest-i15kidsy/test spaces/libraries/ghc-compact/tests/T16992.run T16992 [bad exit code (137)] (compacting_gc) /tmp/ghctest-i15kidsy/test spaces/libraries/ghc-compact/tests/T16992.run T16992 [bad exit code (137)] (normal) Appending 242 stats to file: build_results.txt user error (tests failed) Build failed. 
 Quite frankly I am a bit stumped. First, on why so many test cases were skipped. Second, I have absolutely no idea what could be causing this error or how to fix it. Have any of you had trouble getting GHC running and have encountered something similar? I am using ghc-9.4.7.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Reddit,
 I'm encountering an issue with my Haskell project where modules placed in subdirectories aren't being recognized during the build process. Here's a glimpse of my project's structure:
 src/ ├── Lib.hs ├── Lib2.hs ├── Lib3.hs ├── source │ └── SourceLib5.hs 
 The specific problem arises with SourceLib5.hs located in the source subdirectory. When I attempt to build the project using the following command:
 rm hask-tracer2.cabal && stack clean && stack build --test 
 I receive an error indicating that SourceLib5 cannot be found:
 [Error Output] /home/dewi/code/hask_tacer/hask-tracer2/test/Dewi5Spec.hs:11:1: error: Could not find module ‘SourceLib5’ Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. 
 This error occurs despite the attempt to import SourceLib5 in Dewi5Spec.hs
 import SourceLib5 (getMiddle) 
 Further investigation revealed that SourceLib5 is not listed in the generated hask-tracer2.cabal file:
 exposed-modules: Lib Lib2 Lib3 other-modules: 
 Could anyone help me understand why the module in the subdirectory is not being included in the build and how to resolve this issue? For reference, you can find the project on GitHub: hask-tracer2 (sub-dir-test branch).
 Thank you in advance for your insights!

 I am storing some information about Emacs files in a database and when the a file name is selected in the application, I want an specific Emacs instance to open the file in a chosen frame and window. 
 The Emacs instance could communicate with the app about its state and the app would send the commands to windows.
 The application could be a native application or a web page.
 Are there some functions which can get a file to open in a particular window and a particular frame on some specific instance of Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I get the feeling that learning Elisp as your first Lisp doesn't help with learning Lisp or is even helpful with Emacs itself because the focus of Emacs is too narrow, as though fixating on use-package and other editor configuration code isn't bad enough.
 e.g. when it comes to UIs text prompt and some other wierd font-locking stuff is the usual way, whereas with other Lisps you would be working on a wide variety of GUI and TUI interfaces and other libraries.
 Do those with an experience of other Lisps in feel this way, although learning Lisp may have involved learning Emacs as well because it is the go to Lisp development environment?
 I have seen a number of general Lisp tutorials I want t try, eg https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/w37hyj/video_kavehs_common_lisp_lesson_01/

a. Maybe
 b. []
 c. Validation
 b is the correct answer but I don't understand why. Validation is a type that's defined in the course, but we can ignore it for this question, and consider options a and b only.

 Let's say I start hyperdrive gateway on one machine from within Emacs; if I'm using another machine to connect to that specific hyperdrive, I can only do it read-only (the file is opened in a read-only buffer). Can I have full access to the shared files, from all the machines connected to it? Can I designate, in some way, which clients can have full control?
 Another question would be if it's possible to start a hyperdrive gateway on a Linux system, with no Emacs installed on it, and use Emacs-es on various other machines to connect to that node, also having full control over the files, for all (hand-picked) clients?

 Recently I wanted to get back to Emacs, and as with any text editor I use, installed the Gruvbox theme.
 The problem is that even though the colors are the same, different types of keywords are colored differently which bothers me deeply. Is there an easy way to configure it to the way I'm more used to? Aside from the rainbow brackets which are fine and unconnected to my knowledge.
 Also tried doom-gruvbox bundled with Doom Emacs, and it looked even worse.

 Some of you may still find as I do that it jiggles the neurons in interesting ways to read and hear about others' paradigms and setups.

 I regularly paste text from other sources (e.g. a bit of Wikipedia text for a stub note, or highlighted text from a PDF via org-noter) into my notes and what I am looking for is a way to find/indicate existing org-roam entries in those pieces of text.
 For example, if I have existing org-roam entries for genetic variants and LD, then if I copy a piece of text like
  
Genetic variants that are in LD need to be pruned
  
into a new node, I would like to have some way to highlight/find/link these two potential org-roam links. This doesn't need to happen automagically. Manually calling a function that parses the new node would also be fine.
 So this is basically some sort of "unlinked references", but the other way around. When I manually type text into my nodes, completion does its work, but for pasted text, that is (understandably) not the case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought a new compact "75%" "gaming" keyboard and it turns out it is a US layout keyboard, if that is what it really is. It has lights on all the keys and it doesn't even have Caps Lock and Num Lock indicators as all the keys are lit. If there is a way to indicate the status of the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys I'm yet to discover it.
 There are other similar types whose light patterns programmable, but on this one they appear to be permamently lit.
 It seems that the keyboard vendors charge a hefty premium for a "gaming" keyboard with a UK layout, and my view is that if I have to reprogram the keyboard whether UK or US then I might as well stick to the cheaper US one and reprogram it.
 I got this one for all of £7.99 in baby pink because I could use the color therapy and I love the tactile feedback. I'm not sure how it will last though because one of the keys came off easily.
 UK keyboards have a smaller Left-Shift key with the key for \ and | next to it, before the Z, and on this keyboard \ is activated by Alt-Shift - and | is activated by Alt-, below theESC` key.
 I want to use Alt-= for the | key to keep it closer. Currently pressing Alt-= produces nothing until it is pressed again after which it produces ¸, some kind of tiny right-angled character.
 I have read a few guides which are general and are targetted for Linux from bottom up, but I'd prefer something Emacsy if there is one, and if EXWM requires additional consideration.
 PS. I got another even smaller one in baby blue with 61 keys which I also need to program, but that may have to wait, and boy I never had a glimmer of what Emacs pinky could feel like until I tried to use the basic navigation keys which require the Function and Alt keys to activate them.

 I have used Emacs for years at this point but in a relatively unsophisticated way. I use it basically the same way I would use VSCode or any other editor. I am looking for tutorials on Emacs that will help a user who already knows their way around Emacs to get the most of it, that discusses features which might be overwhelming for a beginner while skipping over basic stuff like navigating around the buffer.
 People always say "Emacs is infinitely customizable!" This is only helpful if you come to Emacs thinking "*My* editor can do X, Y and Z/my editor can't do X, Y and Z, but I want it to. Can Emacs do X, Y and Z?" Then, you can say "Yes, you can write X, Y and Z in elisp." This is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for ideas on ways to improve my workflow using Emacs that I wouldn't have thought of myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering if a similar library to hmatrix exists which can use GPU(s) to do the computations in haskell (i.e. ising ROCm or CUDA). If such library exists, I was hopeful you could provide me with more insight or a link.
 I already did some research, but it was unsuccessful so far, so help would be appreciated, even of the kind "it unfortunately does not exist". I am aware of accelerate, but I was hoping that there is a library with the most common LinAlg functions already built in, similar to hmatrix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seeing there is a move to promote Emacs package/code development as an Advent activity, I present Advent of Code Helper. There are a few examples of Elisp libraries which already fulfill this niche, and I'd like to add mine to that list! So far it's missing a few things (the main one being answer submission.)
 Hopefully either someone finds this useful, or else is inspired by the code to write their own in-house version (which is what I effectively did.)
 (At u/cottasteel's recommendation, I deleted my post marked "Day 4" and reposted this as a Day 5 entry.)

Try very hard to avoid partial functions
  
Why? Because they produce thunks?
