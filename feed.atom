        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I'm wonder if I'm doing something wrong or misunderstand but I'm currently facing some issues on my NixOS system.I'd like to use something like direnv to load flakes. My setup below works great when just launching emacs, but when using emacsclient, it seems to not be working, even though I'm not really receiving any errors from the envrc buffer. It loads the .envrc, build the flake input and export. It just looks like the path does not work afterwards.
 So I've configured Emacs to run as a services using services.emacs.enable = true. For my shell I added programs.zsh.shellInit = ''emulate zsh -c "$(direnv hook zsh)", but I've also tried eval "$(direnv hook zsh)".
 Direnv is installed using the nix-direnv installation instructions under "Via configuration.nix in NixOS".I read some recommendations that envrc.el is a better alternative then direnv.el, and after some testing I have to agree.(envrc-global-mode) is enabled in my config. This works perfectly with a normal emacs instance.
 For some reason it just does not seem to work with the emacsclient.Starting emacs --daemon specifically with a emulated zsh shell does not seems to work.Executing envrc-reload and direnv-update-directory-environment also don't seem to solve it.
 I honestly don't know why this does not work. That's also why I'm posting here and not in a github repo, since I'm not sure where the issue is occurring from. Most of the time I just run normal emacs, but the bigger the config become, the more I'd like to switch to running the daemon.
 Any info is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I put together quickly a binding to the NNG library, it's simply a fork of the existing binding to Nanomsg updated to work with NNG using the "compatible API" plus some bug fixes. For basic usage seems to work pretty well:
 nng: https://github.com/jimenezrick/nng-haskell
 The original nanomsg-haskell bindings are from Ivar Nymoen and Ben Gamari, thanks to them!
 I think the Haskell ecosystem needs a big push in terms of improving its offering of supported RPC/messaging libraries, hence I wanted to have some basic bindings in a workable state.
 For context, if you are familiar with ZeroMQ, Nanomsg and NNG (its evolution) are equivalent RPC/messaging libraries with some technical differences, but in essence the same concept. These are in my opinion a bit a more lean technologies compared to the more bloated gRPC ecosystem.

 I don't like the default dired behaviour of directories' buffers persisting even after you leave them, so I've set it up to always reuse the same buffer.
 The problem that I have now is that it does it even when just visiting some files and that makes it long and difficult to go back to the place I was before doing that.
 For some context: I have configured my dired-map to move upward and inward using h and l (on the lines of distrotube's config, I'm an evil doom-emacs user).
 For the outward movement I'm using this:
 (kbd "h") '(lambda () (interactive) (find-alternate-file "..")
 Taken from http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/emacs_dired_tips.html 
 For the inward movement I'm using this:

 For example, if I have somewhere in my multi-file and sprawling config the statement:
 (require 'elisp-settings) 
 then, the next call to (require 'elisp-settings) will catch that this file has already been provided, and skip re-loading that content.
 ​
 However, every time that I call:
 (literate-elisp-load "elisp-settings.org") 
 It will keep loading all that configuration code. Does anyone have a way to only load each literate config file exactly once?

Working with big files without line feeds can be slow. The standard specifies records and uses a character to indicate the end of such records. I thought if I could make Emacs interpret that character as a line feed, I could then better work with files.
 I tried using an Emacs display table to replace the ^] with \n but it did not seem to improve performance, even though it did visually change the display of text. So, I assume I need to work at a lower level. Does that seem correct?
 Do I need to create a new coding system to get Emacs to consider that end of record character as a line feed? I had also thought of some kind of hook that replaced ^] with \n upon every read and vice versa with writes. Any other suggestions? I would prefer it be a seamless process for other users because I may write a mode to handle such files. Thanks.

 Maybe I approach is wrong, is there other place to search? 
 Or maybe most Scala jobs in those countries are Visa supported but not mentioned on JD, so I should try them also even though they didn't mention about visa or relocation support?

Almost a year ago, when I was on an early stages of learning emacs, I realized that the most clickable key (CTRL) is also the most annoying to use. I tried maybe the most popular approach - to remap ctrl to caps, but that pinky movement was making the whole left part of the keyboard almost unusable in a combination with ctrl, maybe because of the muscle memory, or maybe because of small hands. After a little brainstorm, I decided that this very important key deserves the best place on my keyboard - on the SPACE key, and came up with this changes to the layout:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering if there is a package that can do the few things listed below for braces and parenthesis? I recently had to use Intellij and noticed it had some features by default which I would love to get working in Emacs.
 ​
 Make braces/parens in pairs.
 ​
 When a pair of braces/parens are made, with the cursor in between, hitting enter makes it so the bottom brace goes down two lines and my cursor is in the same position as if I'd hit enter once
 ​
 When on a bottom brace, show the name of the function of statement that is attaches to. An example for this would be if I had a brace for a function that is longer than my screen, when I put my cursor on the bottom brace, something would pop-up (or mini-buffer) saying something like def test() or for etc.
 ​
 Edit:
 So I found electric-pair-mode which solves the first two problems. Anyone know of a package that does the third?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am getting annoyed by automatic formatting rules which I don't know where they come from, every time I press RET on a line with a function declaration. Modes in the buffer:
 Minor modes enabled in this buffer: Auto-Save Company Eldoc Flymake Font-Lock Lsp-Completion Lsp-Diagnostics Lsp-Headerline-Breadcrumb Lsp-Managed Lsp Lsp-Modeline-Diagnostics Lsp-Modeline-Workspace-Status Whitespace Word-Wrap-Whitespace The major mode is C++//l mode defined in cc-mode.el: 
 Example:
 void test()<cursor, pressing RET> // gets formatted into void test() // 4 spaces added // removed 4 spaces added previously, // added one curly brace, and hit RET: void test() {<pressing RET> // gets formatted into void test() { // curly brace moved up one line // 2 spaces added 
 In my .emacs however, I have explictely set:
 (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook (lambda () (setq c-syntactic-indentation nil) (setq indent-tabs-mode t) (setq tab-width 4))) 
 Asking for help with C-h k <RET> gives me:
 RET (translated from <return>) runs the command newline (found in global-map), which is an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’. It is bound to RET. (newline &optional ARG INTERACTIVE) Insert a newline, and move to left margin of the new line. With prefix argument ARG, insert that many newlines. If ‘electric-indent-mode’ is enabled, this indents the final new line that it adds, and reindents the preceding line. To just insert a newline, use M-x electric-indent-just-newline. 
 However, toggling electric-indent-mode or just calling M-x electric-indent-just-newline makes zero difference in behavior.
 TLDR: I don't want emacs to try to be smart about formatting, I can't detect what particular mode / variable needs to be changed in order to just insert newline.

 This would basically be my first major foray into Haskell beyond the LYAHFGG book, and, thus, my first time trying to get as close to purely functional as possible in the embedded space. 
 My current startup strategy is pretty meh in my opinion, which was to just use the generated assembly from a *.hs and link it together with some other tooling, but that somewhat goes against the spirit of what I’d like to do, which is to approach “provable embedded software”. 
 If there are any good books or text based tutorials out there that you can recommend it would be much appreciated.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple weeks ago I posted a little bit of code for getting Emacs 29 to automatically switch between major modes and their tree-sitter enhanced versions, and I couldn't be more thrilled with the response it got. Since then, I've spent some time refining the package, getting it on MELPA, and adding a couple features that I felt were missing. In particular, I wanted Emacs to install and use a grammar as soon as I visit a file that has a tree-sitter version available. treesit-auto 0.3 introduced the treesit-auto-install variable, which can be nil, t, or 'prompt. I like to set it to 'prompt, in case my internet connection isn't great. This is what it looks like when I visit a Rust file without the grammar. If treesit-auto-install is t, it will skip the prompt and install the grammar right away. 
 Otherwise, when this variable is nil (the default), it will try to fall back to one of the original major modes, such as python-mode, js-mode, or rust-mode. The exact details on how it finds a fallback are documented in the README on GitHub.
 Thank you to all who have contributed so far! It's been a fun project to work on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been going id crazy with links to my daily plan file (ala rainer's udumy course). It's been great, but there is one gnarly bug I need to squash that comes up randomly.
 TL;DR: I need a way to force org to rebuild the db. org-id-update-id locations doesn't get it done. org-element-cache-reset doesn't help.
 Repro: I'm not sure exactly what I do, but several undos and a save of my personal.org file got my follow from agenda to stop working (only some items, old items that used to work). Maybe I moved some orders around. But I'm looking right at a top level headline that i can't org-id-goto, even when I copy paste the id I'm staring right at in.
 ​
 Test: Refiling to another file and then trying the update and goto doesn't fix it. It's like the item is bugged. So here is the item just in case I'm being blind (note, this item was not touched recently and seems random that this wound up bugged... along with many others)
 * Test ** NEXT call xxxx for haircut SCHEDULED: <2023-03-01 Wed> A line with name and number (notes text anytime) :PROPERTIES: :ID: 272A86E5-E711-469C-8059-C7D11A4C8717 :END: :LOGBOOK: - State "DONE" from "WAITING" [2023-01-19 Thu 08:35] \\ haircut yesterday - State "WAITING" from "TODO" [2023-01-16 Mon 14:00] \\ texted - State "TODO" from [2023-01-15 Sun 08:47] :END: 
 Thanks for any and info. I don't use org-roam, and the only mentions of this issue seemed centered on that.
 ​
 EDIT: Another oddity, when trying to jump to the id in another file it would just fail to find it. After a restart I get the option to create the heading in the current file. So it seems to have gone from half broken to full broken.

 This works, but notice that isValid tediously repeats the argument x for all functions on the right. I'm wondering if there's a way to avoid this. I thought of the &&& Arrow operator, but as per my understanding, it'll output a 3-tuple, and I've to combine the values manually.

 for one of my college courses im using haskell, and the lecturer asked us to use quickcheck on a set (list) of functions, problem is, i don't know how i should check the property to the list, and GHC (ver 9.4.4) throws me errors each time i try to compile or change the type signature of the prop function to (Natural -> Natural)
 ​
 this is how the main function should look like according to the proffesor
 main :: IO () main = quickCheck $ prop_fac [fac1, fac2, fac3, fac4, fac5] 
 btw, for anyone interested, the quickcheck is for verifying all functions in the list are valid implementations of the factorial

 Often when working on a project there are a number of different org headings that are relevant. These headings are spread across files, and may even be children of each other.
 What I’d like is the ability to add headings to a group (possibly named) and then be able to either switch between them (like ido-switch-buffer) or open up all of them at once (in indirect buffers), or search within just those headings.
 You could go through and tag all of the headings, but this seems cumbersome, and it feels wrong to modify the heading rather than just pointing to it.
 All of my headings have ids, so I’m not worried about ambiguous references.
 I’ve seen packages that work in similar ways for collections of files, or buffers. But I haven’t seen one whose object is a heading.
 Do you know of a package that already exists like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, let me just say that I had written a huge text explaining what I was trying to do, but realized it was too much text and nobody has time for that. So I'll resume it as:
 I have this constructor:
 data Fruit = Apple {quantity :: Int, price :: Double} | Banana {quantity :: Int, price :: Double} | Grapes {quantity :: Int, price :: Double} 
 I have this list of lists:
 [["apple", "2", "1.50"], ["banana", "5", "2.15"], ["grapes", "4", "1.00"]] 
 I'm trying to build a function that iterates through the list of lists and that leverages the constructor above to access the second and third item in order to compute a total:
 total :: [[String]] -> [[Double]] 
 The result would be a list of lists of doubles:
 [[3.00], [10.75], [4.00]] 
 Questions
 Is something like this below valid or am I going in the wrong direction and should use instead some list comprehension or the map function, etc ?
 Notes:
  
qty = quantity
 p = price
 I assume I'll have to convert my list of lists to match the constructor types, or change my constructor to all String, and then convert right before computing numbers.
  
What I want it to do:
  
Grab first list.
 If "apple" is in the first list, then use getters to access the quantity and price.
 Call some function to compute the two numbers and add the result to first list of lists.
 Recursive call on the rest, which should be the next to lists with banana and grapes
  
​
 total :: [[String]] -> [[Double]] total (x : xs) | "apple" 'elem' x = computeFunction(qty, p) : total(xs) | "banana" 'elem' x = computeFunction(qty, p) : total(xs) | "grapes" 'elem' x = computeFunction(qty, p) : total(xs) 
 Something like this behavior --> [3.00] : [10.75] : [4.00] : []

Today we are announcing another update to the API, a new project name, jupyenv, and new features on the site.
You can now find the new site at jupyenv.io.
Why the name change?
We want to reach a bigger audience.
If you are a regular Nix user, jupyterWith is a good name.
It is analogous to the python.withPackages function in nixpkgs.
But outside of the Nix ecosystem, the with naming scheme is non-existent.
To better target people outside the Nix ecosystem, we are changing the name that emphasizes Jupyter environments (hence jupyenv).

 I am stuck at a crossing road between Emacs, ERT, Geiser, SRFI 64 and Guile ! Too much for my current knowledge.
 I would like to evaluate a temporary buffer with Geiser. The said buffer is filled with a Guile script that should write to a file how many tests have been run with a SRFI 64 test suite.
 All of this is part of an ERT test that finally reads from the written file a number to compare to the expected.
 Unfortunately, my script does not seems to write anything to a file.
 If my explanations are not that clear, here is the script I am working on :
 https://framagit.org/Jeko/emacs-srfi64/-/raw/master/srfi64-test.el
 And here is the command line I use to run the ERT test :
 emacs -batch -l ert -l srfi64-test.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit 
 Thank you for anything you could bring to my attention !

 I started using god-mode and I'd like to be able to tell if it's on or not. However, I don't want to use the fringe for that (it's just too far down my screen)
 I was thinking about flipping the colour of the cursor but it doesn't seem to be possible without some ugly hacks. Also, I was thinking about flipping the theme itself but I think it's a bit too extreme
 For now I just switch cursor type to bar (from default box) but that's too subtle
 Any other suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title of the question may not do the justice for what I am seeking so I will try to describe my intent.
 I am already familiar with core functional programming concepts (ADT, pattern matching, lists, error handling, types, etc.) and I have been playing with Haskell for last few weeks and I am now comfortable with syntax and overall ecosystem.
 Now, I want to embark on the journey of solidifying my understanding of Haskell and theory behind it - basically trying to understand why things are the way they are. I understand that this puts me in mathematical domain (I did some intermediate maths in my higher college but mostly centered around physics - calculus, linear algebra, etc.).
 After endlessly trying to search for right starting point, I found myself stuck in Discrete Mathematics, Lambda Calculus, Set Theory, Category Theory and Abstract Algebra. I am vaguely familiar with these branches but absolutely have no clue how they or which one connects the dots with Haskell. I saw some introductory category theory video but it is just too abstract to understand at this stage.
 To reiterate, the goal is to get better understanding of Haskell concepts from more theoretical perspective and build a better mental model. The literature is literally countless. Where should I begin assuming good programming background but very little mathematical background?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched from Helm to Vertico+Consult+Marginalia, and so far I love almost everything about it. The one thing I really miss is having things set up so that when I execute a command that asks for a file, the completion defaults to a file at point.
 I know I can use M-n or PgDn to get to the next item in future history, which may be the eligible thing at point. But I orchestrate a lot of my work from an org file which has bare filenames in it, and it's handy to be able to do C-x C-f RET and open one of these files. Or C-x g (magit-status) RET and go straight to a git repository listed in the file.
 That said, I always had a little trouble when I tried one of these commands and point was on something I didn't want suggested, and I could never remember how to get back to whatever things would be like if it weren't. So maybe I should just deal with this. But more often than not, immediately suggesting the thing at point is what I want.
 I also tried Embark, and it immediately gave me errors, so I turned it off. Plus, I think I'd like to keep doing this in an action-suggest-enter mode rather than what Embark allows.
 Any suggestions for how to do what I want efficiently?

 My wife is preparing to open her medical practice in the next year. We've discussed that it would be nice to have a website where patients can book apppointments, receive reminder e-mails, read her medical notes, etc. I think it would be fun to do it myself.
 In the past, I've played around with Yesod to build simple prototypes, mostly for learning how to build web applications. However, back then, my biggest hurdle was deployment; I didn't know how to deploy and maintain a web application.
 My question is: what platform do you recommend I use to deploy a Haskell-based web application and a small database? I've taken a look at Heroku, and I've estimated the cost at about ~75$/mo. 
 Should I instead learn Nix and rent a dedicated server?

 I would like to learn how to parse JSON in Haskell with the aeson library. 
 I have the following JSON: 
  { "parameters": [ { "name": "restart", "type": "enum<string>", "required": false, "values": { "enumValues": [ "month", "year" ] }, "description": "The restart period.", "notes": [ "Note.", "Note 2." ] }, { "name": "operations", "type": "uinteger", "required": true, "values": { "min": 10, "max": 800 }, "description": "Short description." } ]} 
 You can see that it's a bit weird, but it's close to a JSON I was working with at work.
 I wrote the following code to parse the JSON:

Is that a error of native compiled Emacs?, there is not much information on web about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s anything all the discourse and posturing of the last week has made abundantly clear: the Scala community needs an S-tier IDE.
 I am proud to announce a community initiative to achieve this goal. I am hoping this thread be a transparent forum for us to set the agenda going forward, and offer some suggestions to get the discussion going:
 - Let’s not re-invent the wheel. I propose we start with Ensime:TNG. This project is the seminal work of one of the most respected men in our community. The obvious alternative would be Metals, but let’s be real: Metals has made their bed with Scala Center, and Scala Center has proven to value Political Correctness over Commercial Success.
 - Minimize Distractions and Getting Stuff Done. I propose after this thread conclude we band together under a private github organization. This will prevent bad-faith actors from sabotaging our work, and it will protect you from being canceled for being a collaborator. I have already squatted some github orgs and domain names that could be used. Since I am the owner of these I will obviously benevolently administrate them.
 - Market the IDE. I’ve offered enough suggestions and I HATE marketing. Maybe others have an idea about how we do this. Perhaps a conference CFP? Does anyone know of any conferences happening later this year that will soon be accepting proposals?
 Looking forward to a fearless future with a grade “A” Scala IDE, long live Scala!

 main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "What number for multable?" input <- getLine let num = (read input:: Int) multable num multable :: Int -> IO () multable = do map inc[1..x] [1..x] inc :: [Int] -> Int -> IO () inc list i = do print (foldl (*) i list) 
 I think the problem is with the inc function where it needs bot list and integer input but I'm still completely baffled by haskell syntax..
 Help and feedback would be appreciated!

 I have two questions. 
 (1) Are these features available within Emacs?
  
Bi-directional linking between pages and blocks (paragraphs), feature that is present in Roam, RemNote and Logseq
 Graph representation of all the connections between pages (concepts)
  
(2) Judging by my needs, is it worth it for me to devote my time to learning Emacs? How is "bad" the learning curve?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I mentioned that it would be nice to have some large example org files for testing, and to satisfy people that modern org deals very well with large files. I created such a file based on XML versions of all of Shakespeare's plays. It has about 33k headings, 150k lines, and a million words. I included the simple python parser in case people would like to play. The file itself consists mostly of nested headings with some styling. It might be good to add drawers, COLUMN properties, etc.
 On my org (emacs-mac 28.2, org 9.5.5, slow laptop) everything is super fast, except org-indent-mode, which takes ~30s to initialize; perhaps that could be done more lazily ala font-lock. Feel free to use or link to this however you like.

 Calling play-sound-file returns "no usable sound device driver found"
 The only thing that comes up in my searches is this reddit thread from 3 years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fro9jy/no_usable_sound_device_driver_found/
 aplay -l returns the following:
 **** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices **** card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC662 rev3 Analog [ALC662 rev3 Analog] Subdevices: 0/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 7: HDMI 1 [LG Ultra HD] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 8: HDMI 2 [HDMI 2] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 9: HDMI 3 [HDMI 3] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 1: Microphones [Blue Microphones], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 
 I also have pulseaudio installed.
 The OP of that reddit post found a workaround by running (start-process "aplay" nil "aplay" "/home/xyz/sounds/message.wav") but that doesn't seem to work for me either.
 i am using Manjaro if that helps.
 I would love to be able to use my chronos setup again! Any assistance or insight would be greatly appreciated!
 edit: the file plays fine outside of emacs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Veautiful (my little front-end Scala.js library) 0.3-M6 has been pushed to Maven Central.
 com.wbillingsley %%% veautiful % 0.3-M6
 com.wbillingsley %%% doctacular % 0.3-M6
 This release will probably also get called "0.3.0" soon. As we get closer to the new (Australian) academic year, my focus tends to shift from updating the library to updating my educational sites / OERs that use it. So, it will probably make sense to give this version the 0.3.0 moniker as several sites with materials will move to it.
 The most noticeable change is that DeckBuilder and Challenge are now in the doctacular package. Rather than having to, somewhat undocumented, import veautiful.templates.
 Some additional methods were also added to make it very quick to write and publish a single slide deck (e.g. from a scala-cli script). Roughly
 import com.wbillingsley.veautiful.html.* import com.wbillingsley.veautiful.doctacular.* import installers.* val root = mountToBody(<.p("loading")) given root.installMarked() DeckBuilder(1920, 1080) .markdownSlides("*Markdown text*") .veautifulSlide(<.div("Some components")) .mountToRoot(root) 
 Naturally, you can also install marked via webpack or any other means (as many of my sites do), but root.installMarked() which is available as an extension method in doctacular.installers provides a very short way to get a markdown parser in if you're just trying to publish a single deck from a script.
 Release notes here https://github.com/wbillingsley/veautiful/releases/tag/v0.3-M6
 API docs are on javadoc.io
 Documentation on https://www.wbillingsley.com/veautiful/ is slowly improving.
 Another example of something built with Veautiful is also up: the hour of code session run as part of the "Science Experience" outreach in Armidale on Jan 18th. Go on, see if you can win at Cards of Doom, or land your lander on the Moon.

 As a member of the Swarm developers, I am happy to announce a new release:
  
https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/releases/tag/0.3.0.0
  
Swarm is a 2D terminal programming game with its own language based on polymorphic lambda calculus.
 The big new feature is an LSP OnHover handling, so you can inspect the types of variables and description of predefined functions in Swarm language. The handler lives in LSP.hs and the code itself is in Hover.hs.
 ​
 OnHover demo with return command.
 Another fun thing is that the playable scenarios can now use arbitrary boolean expressions in their objectives (must form a DAG) so you can have alternative endings or lose early.
 Finally, a rather academic (but useful) improvement is pretty printing of the CESK machine that is used to execute Swarm code. If you run into a bug, at least you will be able to read what happened. :)
 There are many other fixes and improvements including several new playable scenarios and challenges. If you have any questions, feel free to ask here or raise an Issue.

Emacs, the text editor that lets you read mail and play Tetris, is often cast in opposition to the Unix philosophy of “do one thing well” and “combine small programs”. It’s a false dichotomy. Emacs can do a lot on its own and be combined usefully with other programs. 
 run‑command makes the combination convenient through a simple configuration format and an interaction flow that stays out of your way. Instead of reaching for a shell or a specialized major mode, you give run‑command a simple “recipe” and you get a contextual command palette where you can browse, select, and run commands without leaving Emacs.
  
Demo:
 https://i.redd.it/aufb2k4q2dfa1.gif
 I use this daily for compilers/linters in watch mode (think npm test:watch, cargo watch -x run, etc), development servers, and some one-off's (e.g. looking up the word at point in wordnet). For other examples of practical applications, check out the cookbook. For installation, quickstart etc see the website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-babel, org-mode code blocks with bits ofPython code, and switch to the interactive Python shell buffer to debug functions and look at the help documentation for modules. 
 If I do help(numpy.random), for example, the shell prints the line WARNING: terminal is not fully functional, and hitting RET then prints out the relevant documentation page by page, with a prompt at the end in the form of :.
  
  
1. How am I supposed to quit this documentation view? I usually hit q RET at the : prompt, which works, but I get a message reading NameError: name 'q' is not defined.
 
2. I can scroll down the help documentation using C-d (or hitting RET repeatedly), is there anyway to scroll up? Page-up just moves the buffer up, rather than scroll. I guess not, as even in a non-Emacs terminal running the interactive shell there isn't a way to do this. Is there a guide to motion/scrolling in inferior-shell-modes in general?

 What is the best way to write key combinations and commands to type when you document something. Let's say I want to write

 Do you use =verbatim= or ~code~ or [square brackets]?
 As I said, I don't need it to export it. Just so it looks nice and consistent across my documents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got started with Doom Emacs and have barely scratched the surface. I don't even know how to describe this problem in a search engine friendly way. I tried, I promise.
 This is what I typed and what shows in the terminal if I cat the file:
  (package! simpleclip :recipe (:host github :repo "rolandwalker/simpleclip")) 
 But from within Emacs, it changes what it displays to:  (package! simpleclip :recipe (:host github :repo "rolandwalker..."))  It basically truncates the string literal using an ellipses. I think this is confusing and I don't want it, but I've looked through docs and Google. Ultimately, I don't know what to even call this feature, so I can't really find out how to turn it off.
 Would someone please point me in the right direction?

Some of my diffs show multi-line regions of text that I know have moved into another file with a different file name. I suspend my ediff and find the other copy/copies of the moved text using helm-ag.
 Usually I would use compare-windows to compare the two buffers. However, often the org-mode headings are at a different level. E.G. everything might be promoted a level higher in one buffer than in the other.
 How can I compensate for this? Can I narrow a buffer to a temporary heading level? Or do I have to actually change the headings levels to match and then change them back afterwards?
 It's quite possible that one hunk of text will have been pushed into multiple other files, so I can end up comparing quite a few different files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I am in the process of learning a bit of Haskell and am trying to work out what is possible and impossible when playing with infinite lists.
 One "toy" problem I came up with was the idea of listing out all the possible integer-sided right triangles up to a max length.
 Of course, this is easy if I "pre-define" a triangles list with the max length already a part of it
  triangles maxLength = [(a, b, c) | a <- take maxLength [1..], b <- take maxLength [1..], c <- take maxLength [1..]] 
 and then use an "isRightTriangle" function as a filter for a rightTriangles maxLength function.
 But is it possible to have an infinite triangles list
  triangles = [(a, b, c) | a <- [1..], b <- [1..], c <- [1..]] 
 that is then later truncated for each tuple element? By that I mean essentially
  take 10 triangles 
 but where a take function operates on the individual infinite tuple elements? The above would of course give  [(1,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,1,4),(1,1,5),(1,1,6),(1,1,7),(1,1,8),(1,1,9),(1,1,10)] 
 rather than the combinations of (a, b, c) where each has had take 10 applied
 I understand this would not really be a great way to define things, but I am curious if this is doable or not.

A major contribution from the last few years is the Haskell Language Server (HLS). I wanted to learn more about GHC internals, and the general compilation pipeline. What better way to learn about these than to work on HLS, helping further improve Haskell tooling in the meanwhile?
In this post I will discuss the experience working on HLS during my internship at Tweag.

What is Haskell Language Server?
Before we move on to digging into the inner workings of HLS, let’s first take a look into what HLS is. Quoting the HLS documentation:
The haskell-language-server (HLS) project is an implementation of a server (a “language server”) for the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is the simplest way to add a list of strings to be considered as possible autocompletions when I try to autocomplete text within org-mode?
 In particular, I notice that in org-mode, M-TAB ultimately tries to autocomplete using the ispell dictionary. Is the best way therefore just to install ispell and add my strings to a user-defined ispell dictionary? That seems awkward.
 Or is it preferable simply to use lazy-completion-table to define a table, and then to define a custom completion function try-my-list which searches that table? Or does that depend on completion.el, which is the wrong thing to use in the textual context of org-mode?
 Basically, I'm confused by the variety of existing autocompletion and template technologies: abbrev, dabbrev, hippie-expand, skeleton, tempel, yasnippet, corfu, cape, etc.. I now use vertico, orderless, and marginalia, but I'm not sure which technology will fit best into this mix.

 I'm setting up a notes system in emacs using denote and related tools. I had been configuring consult-notes and saw a section on embark support in the readme. However, when I added that code to my init file, I get an error. (I don't know that this functionality is fully necessary but I figured it wouldn't hurt to add)
 Here is the code:
 (defun consult-notes-open-dired (cand) "Open notes directory dired with point on file CAND." (interactive "fNote: ") ;; dired-jump is in dired-x.el but is moved to dired in Emacs 28 (dired-jump nil cand)) (defun consult-notes-marked (cand) "Open a notes file CAND in Marked 2. Marked 2 is a mac app that renders markdown." (interactive "fNote: ") (call-process-shell-command (format "open -a \"Marked 2\" \"%s\"" (expand-file-name cand)))) (defun consult-notes-grep (cand) "Run grep in directory of notes file CAND." (interactive "fNote: ") (consult-grep (file-name-directory cand))) (embark-define-keymap consult-notes-map "Keymap for Embark notes actions." :parent embark-file-map ("d" consult-notes-dired) ("g" consult-notes-grep) ("m" consult-notes-marked)) (add-to-list 'embark-keymap-alist `(,consult-notes-category . consult-notes-map)) ;; make embark-export use dired for notes (setf (alist-get consult-notes-category embark-exporters-alist) #'embark-export-dired) 
 And the warning received when I start up emacs is "Symbol's function definition is void: embark-define-keymap"
 ​
 Is there something I need to change about the code? Or do I need to add something to my configuration of embark (which I can paste into a comment if requested)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 ​
 We've put together a small addition to the hasql ecosystem: hasql-listen-notify (GitHub source).
 ​
 Users may be already familiar with hasql-notifications, the first library in the hasql ecosystem to provide asynchronous notification support. So here are a few reasons you may consider switching:
 ​
 - More "hasqly" API featuring Session where appropriate.
 - No dependency on hasql-pool.
 - Safer identifier escaping that uses PQescapeIdentifier() rather than a custom Haskell implementation.
 - More minimal/fundamental poll / await combinators for receiving notifications, rather than a monolithic waitForNotifications that accepts a callback.
 - Correct reconnection handling: it's possible for a libpq connection object to be temporarily disconnected from Postgres, and this library will not throw an exception in this case.
 - Backend PID from notification payload is not thrown away.
 ​
 Thanks and don't hesitate to file an issue or ask a question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I teach a survey of programming languages course. We cover 5 languages, one of which is Haskell. In each language, I show students a program that computes and prints Fibonacci numbers.
 All 5 of these programs do exactly the same thing: print "Fibonacci Numbers", then "F(0) = 0", "F(1) = 1", and so on, up to "F(19) = 4181".
 My Haskell version is below. It works fine, but I'm not a Haskell expert, and I'm wondering how others would do it. So, how would you write this and/or do you have any comments on my code? (Keep in mind that I want my code to be nicely organized, modular, and understandable to relative newbies; this isn't code golf.)
 module Main where -- fibo -- Given n >= 0, return Fibonacci number F(n). fibo n = currfib where (currfib, nextfib) = fibopair n -- fibopair -- Given n >= 0, return a pair of Fibonacci numbers: (F(n), F(n+1)). fibopair 0 = (0, 1) fibopair n = (nextfib, currfib+nextfib) where (currfib, nextfib) = fibopair (n-1) -- printListWithName -- Print items in given list, each preceded by "NAME(#) = ", where NAME -- is the first parameter, and # is an increasing index starting at the -- second parameter. The third parameter is the list. -- -- Example usage: -- printListWithName "Square" 2 [4,9,16] -- Output: -- Square(2) = 4 -- Square(3) = 9 -- Square(4) = 16 printListWithName _ _ [] = return () printListWithName name i (f:fs) = do putStrLn $ name ++ "(" ++ (show i) ++ ") = " ++ (show f) printListWithName name (i+1) fs -- main -- Print some Fibonacci numbers, nicely formatted. main = do putStrLn "Fibonacci Numbers" printListWithName "F" 0 my_fibo_list putStrLn "" where how_many_to_print = 20 my_fibo_list = take how_many_to_print $ map fibo [0..]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For consult users (or the consult curious) minad just added a wonderful new feature to consult: consult-info. I bind it to M-s i. You can choose one or more info manuals to search (comma separated), and then it acts much like consult-grep and friends, searching over the info nodes. 
 Really great for quickly peeking at some topic without the usual rigamarole of entering Info. It's also simple to bind a key to a command to go right to searching your most used info nodes.
 If you add embark into the mix, the power amplifies again: you can narrow down to just the search terms you want using the regular consult "two stage" filtering (e.g #process#async), then embark-export these live filtered results to a Collections buffer, effectively building your own clickable custom index (or three) for the topic(s) you are investigating.
 Clearly the fastest way to RTFM. Take that Google.

 Here, say in project A, I open many files: fileB, fileC, fileD...etc. Let's say I have fileB takes up the whole window (via C-x 0) . I can then easily switch between existing files that I have opened with projectile-display-buffer . I can then choose the buffer/files I want and press Enter. This is all good.
 The problem is this would switch to that buffer but split the screen horizontal. Using the current example, I have fileB and using projectile-display-buffer and pick fileC would result in a horizontal split: fileB on the left, fileC on the right. How do I customize this behavior, i.e. what if I do not want it to split or if I want it to split vertically instead of horizontally?

 I never saw it in any language I tried before, even full bloated node projects can build the first time faster that It took me to run a hello world. 
 There is any trick/config/black magic to speed it up?
 It will take all this time each time I add new dependencies or change sbt version? 
 It's not just my connection with maven central since it took a lot of time on the "(this may take some time)" thing before even start downloading jars, I also work with Java I never saw it before.
 Edit: I deleted some sbt caches and tried to run it with gnomon and I had this output 
 ``` sbt run | gnomon 4.1159s copying runtime jar... 167.3534s copying runtime jar...-sbt sbt 1.8.0 (this may take some time)... 168.2152s copying runtime jar...2.17 (for sbt)... 0.6487s [info] welcome to sbt 1.8.0 (N/A Java 17.0.6) 0.1416s [info] loading project definition from /home/OP/projects/th eunamed/project 7.4709s [warn] jline-2.14.6.jar no longer exists at /home/OP/.cache /coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/jline/jline/2.14.6/jline- 2.14.6.jar 0.0947s [info] loading settings for project theunamed from build.sbt ... 204.1043s [info] set current project to TheUnamed (in build file:/home/OP /projects/theunamed/) 1.4517s [info] compiling 1 Scala source to /home/OP/projects/theuna med/target/scala-3.2.1/classes ... 0.1659s [info] done compiling 0.0638s [info] running helloWorld 0.0223s Hello, world 0.3625s [success] Total time: 206 s (03:26), completed Jan 30, 2023, 11:55: 52 AM 0.0001s

 More than 6 minutes and seems that It even doesn't need to download the project dependencies, It loaded jars and configurations related to sbt only in the slowest steps.

Convince yourself of the previous claim (that the lifting operation can be generalized) about 'ReaderT' by writing and comparing several MonadMn instances for 'ReaderT'.
  
Here's the instance for MonadError found online.
 liftThroughReaderT :: m a -> ReaderT r m a liftThroughReaderT x = ReaderT $ const x class (Monad m) => MonadError e m | m -> e where throwError :: e -> m a catchError :: m a -> (e -> m a) -> m a instance (MonadError e m, MonadError e ((->) r)) => MonadError e (ReaderT r m) where throwError e = liftThroughReaderT $ throwError e catchError m h = ReaderT $ catchError (runReaderT m) (runReaderT . h) 
 I understand the notation m -> e means "e is determined by m". What does e ((->) r) mean?

 I would like to share a couple of packages I have been using for some time for FPGA/ASIC design and verification:
 - https://github.com/gmlarumbe/verilog-ext/
 - https://github.com/gmlarumbe/vhdl-ext/
 These add some extensions to SystemVerilog/VHDL and are built on top of Emacs `verilog-mode' and `vhdl-mode' respectively.
 Here are some of their current features:
  
Tree-sitter support (requires Emacs 29)
 Improve syntax highlighting
 Hierarchy extraction and navigation (verilog-ext)
 LSP configuration for `lsp-mode` and `eglot`
 Support for many linters via flycheck
 Improve imenu entries: detect instances, classes and methods
 Code navigation functions for RTL and Verification environments
 Beautify modules and instances (verilog-ext)
 Extended collection of custom and yasnippet templates insertion via hydra
 Additional misc utilities (e.g. code formatter integration for Verilog)
  
Looking forward to receiving some feedback! And contributions are of course also welcome! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am confused by the Tramp documentation regarding the auto save feature. According to the documentation (emphasis mine):
  
4.20 Auto-save, File Lock and Backup configuration 
 To avoid TRAMP from saving backup files owned by ‘root’ to locations accessible to others, default backup settings in backup-directory-alist have to be altered. 
 Here’s a scenario where files could be inadvertently exposed. Emacs by default writes backup files to the same directory as the original files unless changed to another location, such as ~/.emacs.d/backups/. Such a directory will also be used by default by TRAMP when using, say, a restricted file /su:root@localhost:/etc/secretfile. The backup file of the secretfile is now owned by the user logged in from TRAMP and not ‘root’. 
 When backup-directory-alist is nil (the default), such problems do not occur. 
  
First, it states that the default value of backup-directory-alist must be changed to avoid saving root files as a normal user in a local directory.
 But then, it says that it does not happen with the default value.
 When running Emacs (both -q and -Q, master from Dec 4th), it behaves like the first paragraph: when opening a file using su (or remote ssh+su), it warns about writing a local backup and aborts opening if you say no. Therefore, it looks like the last sentence "When backup-directory-alist is nil (the default), such problems do not occur. " is wrong.
 Is it actually wrong, or am I misunderstanding it?

 Iron is a refined types system. It enables the user to attach constraints to types, checkable at compile-time or/and runtime.
 scala val x: Int :| Positive = -1 //Does not compile! 
 This is especially useful to avoid invalid domain values:
 ```scala case class User(name: String :| Alphanumeric, age: Int :| Positive)
 User("John", -35) //Does not compile! User("John_", 35) //Does not compile! User("John", 35) //Compiles ```
 Or, at runtime using Eithers:

It loaded my config just fine using M-x load-file RET ~/.emacs.d/init.el, but when I close and reopen Emacs, it just gives me the default config without any warnings at all, but it will load just fine if I execute the aforementioned command. I've done this entire process on several different machines, but for some reason this one just doesn't work. Any ideas on how to fix this?

 Is there some programmatic way of knowning which keys or key combinations are not used in a particular window?
 Of course they will be some additional modes which might be using other keys not used by normal/evil, so should be accounted for as well.
 I'm looking for keys on the main row, ie excluding the Function, Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys and numeric keys. That will be limiting, but any routine which can list unused keys in any mode will be fine.

 I bought a MacBook, but it has very little storage space. I learned that emacs can use configuration and rich plug-ins to achieve many functions, such as code editing, document editing, markdown editing, rendering and so on. In addition, I am a programmer, and I usually write some java, scala, python, shell, Go, Rust, nodejs, and a very comprehensive code language assistance is also very useful! Any caring veterans here to tell me how I should be able to start this journey? Or a configuration to let me just dash forward?
 I'm so so sorry about my poor english,
 But I think everyone can feel my appeal, thank you again!

 would make the list into [2,4,6,8] in ghci but what if I wanted to premake the list [1,2,3,4] so that when I call doublemap it will become [2,4,6,8] without having to add the list on ghci.

 This is for a homework question but it isn't close to the actual problem and I am just learning Haskell. I hope this doesn't break the rules.

 I'm learning haskell and also interested in functional programming relatively newly. I used to develop in many programming languages such as Rust, Ruby, Python, C++, C#, Java, Kotlin and Swift. So I got used to all those programming approaches, design patterns etc. After all, I had seen the functional programming way and really loved the idea and that gave me another way of thinking. I'm still learning. 
 I think I understood what a monad is, even that knowledge helped me in oop way of programming. And now I'm learning about monad transformers. I have read a few blogs and pages about them but they are still not that clear to me. 
 Could anyone please explain those to me? Maybe with examples or comparisons to oop. 
 Because such questions always have answers out there but they are usually either so high level therefore only the ones who have experience in the field can understand or so basic examples and information that no one can properly understand the "needs" and the importance of it so it becomes useless. It is why I'm asking here to the community. 
 Thank you for your answers in advance

 Before adding the above line everything in my config was fine. But now it messed up all the formatting in my config.org file like the following example:

 It now creates errors when I load up doom emacs since the config.org was tangled into config.el. I am trying to figure out how to fix the formatting and I am not sure why some of the brackets are red since I never had any issues before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 tldr; Probably a total noob Q, but I need to edit my config.yaml file on the headless pi running my HA instance. That file needs to be accessed as my home assistant user (not the regular user of my local or remote machine)
 I can:
  
Edit the file remotely:
  
 $ ssh me@raspberry_pi $ sudo -u homeassistant -H -s $ nano /filepath 
  
Visit my regular user's files in emacs:
  
``` SPC .
 /ssh:me@raspberry_pi:/file/path ```
 I am struggling to understand what I need to do within emacs to replicate (1). 
 The main issue I'm finding baffling is the logical jump from editing as my normal user, to editing as the HA user (a user setup with no password). 
 Is anyone able to explain to me like I'm 5?
 Also, maybe a doom emacs issue, but tramp crashes emacs a lot. For example if I mistype a password or file path. Which during trying to figure out the above has caused me to enter many a killall emacs into my terminal emulator

 I am trying to create an Elisp link in an Org document that would display an agenda view matching a particular tag in the current buffer.
 Here is what I could do so far:
 [[elisp:(org-agenda nil "m" t)][test]] 
 This opens a "match" agenda view with a restriction on the current buffer. However I still have to choose the tag.
 Is there any way to pass the tag programmatically? I'd prefer to avoid tricks such as executing a saved keyboard macro.
 Thanks :)

 I understand that Martin Odersky is an academic and his job is to do language research, not necessarily support industry or Scala adoption, so it's not for me to say that Caprese isn't the best way to do that. However, I think it would be much better for it to be released as a completely separate language as opposed to the next version of Scala. Scala 3 is awesome as a language but it was disruptive to commercial efforts in Scala. I am not sure we can take another hit like that.

 - People mention webdav, are people still rolling their for this?
 - Working Copy would work but then everything has to go through a commit, which seems silly. (I use github, but not for everytime I check off an item).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have written a python function that takes a string input and performs a semantic search in my org-roam-directory and outputs the results in the following format after 2 seconds of computation:
  
[{'score': 0.9137982130050659, 'file:': '/Users/user/org/example.org', 'content': 'In this article, we introduce a new algorithm.'}, {'score': 0.9033759832382202, 'file:': '/Users/user/org/statistical_model.org', 'content': 'Statistical Model for Denoising.'}]
  
So it is essentially a list of dictionary with score, file location, and content. I can call the python function in the command line by invoking: /Users/user/org/anaconda3/bin/python /Users/user/org/sentence-transformer.py "algorithm and model" and then it gives me the above printed output in the terminal.
 I want to present this output in the emacs minibuffer just like consult-ripgrep, and be able to select one of the options and open the file's content in another buffer.
 I am currently trying to do this in elisp as follows:
 (defun open-file-from-python-script (input-string) (interactive "sEnter input string: ") (let* ((python-script-path "/Users/user/org/sentence-transformer.py") (output-string (shell-command-to-string (concat "/Users/user/org/anaconda3/bin/python " python-script-path " " input-string))) (output-list (json-read-from-string output-string)) (file-path (completing-read "Select a file: " output-list :key #'cdr :predicate #'stringp))) (find-file file-path))) 
 However, it does not work and only outputs: Bad String Format: 10
 I am not too familiar with elisp so I was wondering how to do this properly?

I restarted, and when I opened a .rs file, it said sh Server rust-analyzer:4308/starting exited ( check corresponding stderr buffer for more details). Do you want to restart it?  No matter how many times I press yes, it doesn't work. When I check the stderr, it says sh /nix/store/1ir4vjclva3bzvyz2n0axh87kyv3hzr1-emacs-28.2/bin/emacs: /home/nixolas/.emacs.d/.local/etc/lsp/rust/rust-analyzer: No such file or directory  Even though when I navigate there, there is a file there named rust-analyzer. Any ideas? I've been trying to fix this for 2 hours now.
 EDIT: I found out that the rust-analyzer file isn't actually either a directory or a file. I deleted it and reran it, and looked at the log, and this is the rust-analyzer output.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellows, I am using this repo to build emacs on aarch64 mac. During the building, there are a lot of warning messages like: 
  
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/install_name_tool: warning: changes being made to the file will invalidate the code signature in: /Users/Desktop/build-emacs-for-macos/builds/Emacs.2023-01-26.d865e18.master.macOS-13.arm64/Emacs.app/Contents/Frameworks/libexpat.1.dylib 
  
And after the build finished, the Emacs failed to open with the crushing message that EXC_BAD_ACCESS (Code Signature Invalid). 
 I found a temporary solution that re-signs the emacs (I guess?) with codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/Emacs.app. 
 But, why these warning messages appear, and what's going on about those dylib? Do you guys have met the same issues on your side?

 I changed this before so that I could have emphasized text between a word.
 Now there is an issue that my special blocks (for latex) underlines the text between the #+begin_<environment> and #+end_<environment> lines. Additionally, if I want to caption something w/ attr_latex: :options{caption] the begin_<environment> line becomes begin<environment>. Since neither SRC or EXAMPLE blocks have this issue, I am wondering if there is a solution to fix my issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 I'm relatively new to org mode but find it very useful so far. I am wanting to move away from Obsidian and bring my notes into org. I was able to convert my markdown files to org, using pandoc and following some online answers about removing the property drawers that pandoc creates and automating the conversion.
 The admittedly vague question that I have is how to use the tools of org mode to help organize the information. In obsidian I used tags, included nested tags. (I also had some "structure notes" for topics linking to notes) But I wonder what is a good way to do this in org. I'm focused right now on transferring my literature notes, which are notes on one article, book, or chapter. Should I use properties instead of tags? 
 Would anyone be willing to share how they structure their literature notes (or anything similar)? Examples would be great.
 I should also say that I'm currently using citar and am considering using denote (and citar-denote). So if anyone is using those tools and have advice on setting that up, it would also be appreciated.

What does Text and IO in above type definition signifies? Can I build my own type using ScottyT with some different behavior? Also, I understand the the M letter at the end means monad by convention, what does letter T at the end of type name suggest?

 I can make it bring up the completion frame at point, but the frame is just an empty box. I can see it's doing something in the background since CPU usage shoots up, but it's just stuck. If I press C-g a few times, it will eventually render the completion options, but the frame is still frozen.
 I've tried using corfu-terminal as well, in case it was something funky with child frames, but it's the same.
 company-mode seems to work fine.

 I've written a post about Erlang and what, I think, makes it great for implementing reliable distributed systems in:
 https://github.com/stevana/armstrong-distributed-systems/blob/main/docs/erlang-is-not-about.md#erlangs-not-about-lightweight-processes-and-message-passing
 The reason I post it here is because I think it doesn't necessarily look anything like the distributed-process effort and I've started working towards a different approach in Haskell.
 I've already shared some bits of this work in the past couple of weeks, and I got the code for supervised state machines and hot code swappable state machines mostly done. Some more work is still needed on documentation, then I'll post about that here as well.
 As always, I'm curious to hear your thoughts, comments or questions!

 This is called form another function like (maybeAuthorDoc author)where author is a Maybe String. The problem is that now I have to create the same code for directors
 Instead of writing the following (used by calling (maybeDirectorDoc director))
 maybeDirectorDoc :: Maybe String -> Doc maybeDirectorDoc = maybe empty (\content-> text "> Director:" <+> text content) 
 How can I generalize this?
 Should I use a new datatype?
 data Person = Author (Maybe String) | Director (Maybe String) 
 If so, how can I pull out the Author or Director in a generalized function?
 maybePersonDoc :: Person -> Doc ??? but then maybe is gone MaybePersonDoc...?

 I suspect Emacs doesn't have anything like clojure.spec and those fancy utilities mentioned there, but for someone new to TDD in any language whatsoever, how do I go about writing tests for my Emacs-lisp code?
 My tests now are to make up for the for the lack of types in Emacs first because that is what bites me the most. I know that is the way it is with dynamic languages, whether Lisp, Javascript, Ruby or whatever and that is how these languages get some of their power, but it gets truly frustrating.
 The correctness of the logic comes later as my understanding of Lisp improves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was messing around with a toy compiler concept and had this idea I’ve been wanting to ask about. 
 (Also I suppose it’s not strictly related to Haskell, so feel free to delete this post, but the Haskell community is very lively with new language ideas so it seemed like a good place to start I suppose.)
 TL;DR
 Anyway, some languages have syntax to turn a valid prefix function into an infix function, and could you do so at the type level?
 Such as,
  f :: from X to Y 
 Which denotes that ‘f’ should be between some given ‘x’ and ‘y’. I.e. x f y.
 The idea was to try to mimic methods from OO languages. 
 Furthermore what if we had something like (note the words between fn and the type signature, the function name itself is has name),
  fn has name :: from Person to String -> Bool 
 Such that you could do,
  result = person has name “Colbyn” :: Bool 
 Pretty sweet syntax I’d say, but is this possible?
 Would this be possible to infer and type check? 
 Because idk maybe it's a dumb idea (I was just playing around).
 Thanks! 🙂

I remember when I started using Emacs one of the things that I found very awkward was the way Emacs handled the resizing of windows. So I've created a way that is more "intuitive" to me and may be useful for those just starting out in Emacs.

The font seems sharp everywhere else except some aspects of the modeline as shown in the screenshot below. I'm using my own configuration from scratch and i want to note that the blurriness happens even in the default modeline. The blurriness also persists even if i make the font a lot bigger.
 The way i have set my font is the following:
 (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "JetBrains Mono" :height 120) 
 I'm quite new to emacs and i was wondering, maybe i'm setting it the wrong way? Any input as to what might be causing this is very welcome.
 Thank you for your time!

One thing I'd like to be able to do though, is pass the results of a custom find command to counsel. The idea would be that I could fuzzy find over the results of a recursive file search. At the moment, counsel only lets me fuzzy find the current directory, and i have to press C-j each time I want to go deeper into the file tree, which can be a bit slow.
 On the command line I can do something like find ~/ | fzf with some flags to deselect directories or files etc
 Is that achievable with counsel, or do I need to look at a different completion system?

 What I would like is one of two options:
  
Open the agenda view to see when I am free, and then to schedule an event directly from a focused day on the agenda view. Of course I could use a capture, but then from the capture I'd have to open a date picker and navigate to the same date that I already found via the agenda view, so navigating to the same day twice.
 
Have information about existing events displayed in the date picker.
 
 I'm sure there's an easy way to do this but I haven't found it yet!

 When I call the function (my/custom-elfeed-colors) the changes don't get applied, but if I go manually to the end of the first line "Highlight starred feeds" and select eval-last-sexp doing it manually applies the change.
 I will make those hex values change depending on the theme, a hook will fire which will change the hex values when changing the color scheme, but it works on the idea that the function is called each time the theme is changed and if the function doesn't apply the face rules then nothing works.
 I'm pretty sure Elisp is aware of the code inside the function but after calling the function it behaves like it is parsed but discarded. Maybe there is another way that tells Emacs to run those line when called no matter what?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently designing a programming language. One of my goals is to have a similar ecosystem of typeclasses like haskell - functors, applicatives, etc.
 I’m curious about the haskell community’s opinion of what could be done better when it comes to infix operators for these sort of functions. How could it be made more intuitive? Make more sense? And anything similar.
 Basically, if you had the chance to redesign haskell’s stdlib binary operators from the bottom up, what would you do?
 Any input would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

All you need is higher kinded types by Las Safin
Haskellers (and even worse, dependent type brained people) are prone to making complicated types to maximise abstraction and correctness. However, you might be surprised to know that you (technically) need nothing more than ADTs, HKTs, and rank-N types to do almost all of the magic you need.

 Have a few use-cases that I feel could do with some additional structure inside org.
 So, first, I know I can use properties; I know I can use org-ql. I'm not a wizard with agenda views and you might broadly consider me a beginner.
 I'm debating between org, a folder full of YAML, and a full-on database, for basically cataloguing various items (possessions, books, papers, movies, games, restaurants, brands, social media posts, online essays, podcasts, etc.). I want to be able to store metadata about these items, link to relevant files, and so on. I'm feeling the limitations of currently using different apps for interaction with some of these. For example, I currently use:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been attempting to define two sum types and then compose them into a single type. I view this operation as defining two type constructors, each with a set of data constructors of cardinality greater than one, and attempting to form a new set that is their union. I thought this would be fairly straightforward.
 Here is a distilled version of my attempt:
 data As = A1 | A2 | A3 data Bs = B1 | B2 | B3 type A = As type B = Bs 
 And then, despite the appearance of various syntactic innovations, I've had no success. Essentially, I'd like to do something of the sort: type C = A | B, but that does not work.
 So my questions are:
  
If there is a way to properly do this, how to do so?
 
If there is not -- why not? Haskell is very well thought out and so there must be some reason for disallowing such action. Perhaps it's not so much that the action is itself problematic, but that it would interfere with other language semantics. In any case, I'm curious what the reason is. 
 
 Edited: As an aside: the project I'm working on involves parsing. As such, I wanted to create a simple parse tree for a basic 'arithmetic grammar', as in "3 + 2 - 5", etc. To start off, I wanted to create a binary tree and within that tree I wanted the nodes to be able to hold types that were either binary operations or numbers. I don't think this is optimal, but it was what was driving the original attempt. The project is in large part for learning as well. So upon trying to do something like: type NodeVal = Op | Val, errors arise. I'm adding this aside for some context.
 Thank you.

Essentially, between consecutive special block definition lines (eg. #+begin_definition above #+end_definition) I end up with the contents in the middle being underlined, and any other special blocks are font-locked to normal text (I'd like these lines to look like the lines of an SRC or EXAMPLE block's definition lines).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have a small function that changes the color of the TODO keywords depending on the theme.
 (defun my/todo-keywords () (setq org-todo-keyword-faces `(("SOMETHING" . (:foreground ,(ef-themes-with-colors bg-main) :weight bold))))) (add-hook 'ef-themes-post-load-hook #'my/todo-keywords) 
 The result after checking C-h v org-todo-keyword-faces is:
 Value (("SOMETHING" :foreground "#fcffff" :weight bold)) 
 and the hex value changes every time I change the ef theme to a different one.
 But still doesn't take effect. I need to restart Emacs to see the color applied. Is there a function that does a refresh for the org todo keyword faces without having to restart Emacs or Org mode?

I can't really find anything about this, so either I seem to be the only one running into it or this is the intended behavior. Instead of wrapping the tooltip when it is near the right side, I would expect it to just offset the entire box to the left.
 Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Some context: ki is a lightweight structured concurrency library. You can find a previous release announcement here on Discourse or here on Reddit.
 ​
 @TristanCacqueray has discovered a small correctness bug affecting ki-1.0.0 and ki-1.0.0.1; now ki-1.0.0.2 has been uploaded to Hackage, the only version not known to contain any bugs ;)
 ​
 In short, a child thread that throws an exception during cleanup induced by its scope closing would likely fail to propagate its exception, leading to deadlock (usually if not always detected by the GHC runtime, which would then blast out BlockedIndefinitelyOnSTM exceptions).
 ​
 Here is the issue: https://github.com/awkward-squad/ki/issues/19
 And the patch: https://github.com/awkward-squad/ki/pull/20
 ​
 Please update your dependencies accordingly and happy new year!

 I use evil-mode. When testing my config locally by launching emacs through emacs -nw, I can enter insert mode, and exit via <esc>. However, when running emacs in ssh-ed server in console-mode, I'm unable to exit insert mode with <esc>. From my understanding, it's a terminal issue. However, I'm not sure why it works locally vs not over ssh.
 Does anyone know how to map <esc>?

 Maybe somebody has an idea what I might change in my large setup in order to get rid of this issue ...

 I've researched the problem as best I can, but none of the relevant posts seem to have an answer. People seem to be asking the question, but the answers seem like they're answering something different. Maybe I'm just misunderstanding them.
 The behavior I want is to use ESC to "escape" commands and stuff. I hit M-x or C-x or M-x M-f, realize I didn't mean to, then hit ESC to make it go away. I do not want ESC to ruin my window layout. I honestly can't comprehend why anyone would want that to be the default behavior anyways.

It will continue to keep growing and I have begun to wonder the most efficient way to retrieve the information. I could use ripgrep or rg.el to find the notes efficiently, but I imagine that if the database is very huge and I don't have the correct regular expression in use, then I might not retrieve the correct files. 
 Inspired by chatGPT, I was impressed at how it retrieves info from the internet and speeds up my time for finding information even when I do not know the correct keywords. I figured a NLP model primarily trained on my database would be an easier task and I was wondering if someone had already created something like this or how would they go about it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been spending far too much time trying to figure this out. I want to have a single shortcut I can trigger so that the active region is wrapped in a pair of characters, e. g. text (selected in the active region) becomes ³text³.
 So far I have this but it doesn't do what I want:
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") (lambda () (interactive) (query-replace-regexp ".*" "³\&³")))
 I also have a suspicion that this will draw on the entire buffer rather than just the active region, even though I read somewhere that query-replace-regexp should only affect the active region when there is one.
 I know there are other ways of doing this but I've settled on regex replace as that is a single step and I can also undo it in one step. I'd like this to be as non-interactive as possible (e. g. not having to press 'y' to confirm) apart from the command working only on the active region.
 Many thanks!

 Based on this answer, I need to load minted with the newfloat environment. If I try to do this in my setupfile, I end up with an options clash for minted.
 My configuration is sort of a mess too, so I have multiple places where I load the minted package, and I'm not sure how to combine these or which are really necessary to keep... ``` (add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("" "tikz") "minted" "xcolor") (setq org-latex-listings 'minted org -latex-packages-alist'(("" "minted")) org-latex-minted-options '((...options here...))) (add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("cache=false" "minted"))
 ```
 After exporting to pdf, the associated tex code for the #+src block looks like...  \begin{listing} \begin{minted} // code here \end{minted} \caption{ caption } \end{listing} 
 What I would like is to just be able to write in an org-file ```
 +caption: my caption
 +begin_src <insert language>
 // code
 +end_src
 ```
 and have it export appropriately, where in the pdf I have the caption above my code block in the algorithm style.
 Any help is appreciate. Thanks in advance.

 I have this code right now, and I'm sort of stuck. On ghci, this works using reifyNat {- int -} fizzString, but if I take out the -- on the FizzBuzz u, I can't coerce the Nat into a Symbol usefully, because ConsSymbol apparently is not instanced into KnownSymbol.
 ​
 I've asked around on IRC, and I was told that there's no way to usefully instance the FizzBuzz because type-level information disappears at runtime, but I really don't want to have to try to learn Singletons. It's working as long as I don't have to do a type-level show for Nat, but doesn't this suggest that I can somehow finagle the code to work without having to resort to Singletons?
 ​
 
 ​
 Edit: gah, got a regression. I can't even get this code to work without the NatToSymbol stuff. Seems as though I've forgotten something.

I tried asking ChatGPT because I get to torture it indeinitely until I understand, lol. I think I figured it out, but I need confirmation from actual qualified people:
  
We have the category of endofunctors, which in the context of Set/Hask are just all functors (because we’re limited to a single category).
 For any m <= Monad m, we take all morphisms of type Identity a -> m b (natural transformations between functors Identity and m) and make them a separate category.
 That category is a monoid, with (<>) = (>=>) :: (Identity a -> m b) -> (Identity b -> m c) -> Identity a -> m c (Kleisli composition), and mempty = return :: (Identity a) -> m a, where the Identity monad is simply elided for out convenience.
  
Did I get it all right? And if so, wouldn’t the correct definition be “a monad is a monoid in the category of morphisms from the category of endofunctors”? Upd: Or is it what monoid as a category already implies?

 \( \) start/end of group \{3\} previous character or group, repeated 3 times \{3,\} previous character or group, repeated 3 or more times \{3,6\} previous character or group, repeated 3 to 6 times 
 But brackets do not:
 [...] any character between brackets [^..] any character not in the brackets [a-z] any character between a and z 
 Now, in the minibuffer I can use these rules, BUT in Elisp code I have to use double backslashes where I need only one in the minibuffer.
 Questions
 Can someone please explain, why we need a backslash in front of some characters to begin with? Are they otherwise interpreted?
 Next, why the doulble backslash in Elisp code?

 But suppose also the eval-expression (M-:) command still works for me, and I can still evaluate Emacs Lisp commands.
 In this situation, is there a function or command could I run to set the running Emacs Lisp image back to the state it was in when Emacs first launched (up to loading of init.el) but without loosing any of my open unsaved buffers or halting any running child processes?

 Sometimes I find it annoying to keep track of which prompt caused which output, especially if there are many lines of output for each prompt, meaning I often have to scroll way up (or run comint-previous-prompt) just to check the prompt, and then get back down.
 So, I wrote this pretty simple package that creates a header at the top of a shell-buffer, displaying the prompt above the window. This makes it easier to keep tracks of prompts because you'll always see the prompt associated with every line of output currently visible in the buffer. (see screenshot)
 Here's the package repo with a more detailed README. Feel free to reach out with any questions/critiques/feedback :)

 So I need to browse and work on a very large codebase (LLVM). I am not a power user of Emacs with C++, but for what I understood LSP with clangd is now pretty mature. Moreover, IIUC, LSP provides code navigation via Emacs' xref.
 Historically the usual way to explore code was using a tag utility, like ctags, etags, rtags or gtags. I've tried searching online, but the resources I found are pretty outdated, and I suspect they are not even aware of LSP.
 So the question is:
  
would you say an external program is still the best way to explore C++'s code on Emacs, or is clangd + xref enough? Is it becoming the de facto standard? Is there something that a tag program can do but clangd can't (or viceversa)?
 
I have heard that C++ code can be quite difficult to index, due to complex include nests, preprocessor directives and what else (because C++!). Is this problem still relevant in 2023? If yes, what solution handles it best?
 
 Thanks!

 I'm thinking of something like org-agenda-goto-date, except that it queries for a regex that matches the headline text, and goes to the next chronological match.
 I often want to search forward in the agenda to see when a particular appointment is, and what else is going on that day. The nearest thing I've found is to call org-agenda, do a keyword search, find the entry I was looking for, and then call org-agenda again and jump to that date. I'm sure there's an easier way of doing this, but I haven't found it.

 But when I hit S-RET in the leftmost cell in the last row, the next row isn't started with 2023-01-21, but with 2024-01-20.

 How can I make org-table-copy-down work with the days instead of the years? The variable org-table-copy-increment was set to t, I tried setting it to 1, but that didn't help.

# Web and Internet Are Different Terms

It is common to observe people using the terms _Web_ and _Internet_ in such a way that it appears that both define the same concept: a giant invisible network that interconnects people and realities. However, it is important to understand that both terms have different meanings, although they are connected.

The Internet is the medium through which all information travels between servers and users. This information, being very general, needed to be contained in standards so that all connected devices could understand and communicate with each other. Therefore, the Internet is made up of applications that exercise this function of regulating communication through protocols.

The Web is an Internet application. It allows users to interact with servers through websites: interactive pages that allow navigation between files and pages present on the server.

 I'm happy to announce the third part of a five part tutorial on property-based testing stateful systems in general, and distributed systems in particular:
 https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial/blob/main/docs/Part03SMContractTesting.md#readme
 In the previous part we introduced concurrent state machine testing to test for race conditions using linearisability.
 In this part we will build upon the second part and show how to test bigger systems in a modular way. We introduce the property-based testing equivalent of fast and deterministic integration testing against fakes and show how to ensure that the fakes are faithful to the real components.
 I hope to announce part four on fault-injection next week.
 Any questions, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using straight.el to manage Emacs packages, however for some reason I have incorrect Tramp version, at least this is how Tramp reports it via tramp-version command. The reason I ask about this is Ivy stopped working with su:: if I use Tramp installed by straight.el.
 If I put this in my config, then tramp-version reports 2.5.1.1 and Ivy doesn't work when I type su:: prompting an error:
 (straight-use-package 'tramp) 
 If I remove this line, then Tramp reports a newer version (the one that comes with Emacs 28.2 which I use), then Ivy works correctly.
 I checked files manually at straight/repos/tramp and it seems that the Tramp version should be 2.6.0, but for some reason it isn't. I can't even find a string 2.5.1.1 in the whole repo of Tramp so I'm not sure where it's coming from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using the hint package to evaluate an arithmetic expression.
 type Assignment = [(String, Integer)] evalExpr :: Expr -> Assignment -> IO (Maybe Integer) evalExpr expr a = Ex.handle handler $ do i <- I.runInterpreter $ do I.setImports ["Prelude"] let stmts = map (\(var, val) -> var ++ " <- return " ++ show val) a M.forM_ stmts $ \s -> do I.runStmt s I.interpret (show expr) (I.as :: Integer) return $ E.either (const Nothing) Just i where handler :: ArithException -> IO (Maybe Integer) handler DivideByZero = return Nothing handler ex = error $ show ex 
 Problem is, in spite of handling the DivideByZero exception, it still throws the exception. Following is one example.
 (((32 * 45) `div` (41 `div` (20 * 8))) 
 Expr is a Rose tree, but that's irrelevant to the question since the evaluation happens on a string.
 I don't understand why the exception is not caught.

 My hope would be that by either writing #+caption: or #+attr_latex: :name [] above the #+SRC block that the desired effect would be reflected in the .tex file and ultimately the PDF.

 If you have read both books, can you pick me one option from the following: 
  
Read SICP only - (my guess: it's a great book about FP so you don't need to read "Functional Programming in Scala" any more) 
 Read "Functional Programming in Scala" only - (my guess: This book covers most of the general FP concepts in depth so no need to read SICP any more)
 Read SICP then "Functional Programming in Scala" - (my guess: "Functional Programing in Scala" doesn't tell FP thoughts in an easy-to-understand way so you want to read SICP at first)
 Read "Functional Programming in Scala" then "SICP" - (my guess: "Functional Programming in Scala" is in depth enough, but it doesn't cover FP topics outside Scala. So you want to read SICP later)

 I'm not sure it's possible after thrashing on it a bit last night and some googling, but I'm trying to come up with a boolean query that looks for anything with a Start >= 2022-01-01 and where the Fin date is >= 2023-01-01 or where the Fin date is /not/ present.
 So, as pseudocode: (start >= 2022-01-01) AND ( Fin >= 2023-01-01 OR Fin ""))
 Something like:
 tags "Type={.}+Start>="<2022-09-23>"+{ Fin>="<2023-01-01" \| Fin = "" }"
 So, first off,
  
Not quite sure to ask for a second condition (ie. >= and !=) on a prop. I've only seen +Fin={this \| that} example-wise
 How is a NOT done (I had assumed it was !=) but that does not give (my =] ) expected output. Can you even query on the non-presence/no-value of a property?
 Also, not sure those queries honour math order of ops?
  
Is there a way to create that query with those 3 properties or do I need to add another prop like Done: false to get around the above issues? (ie. Start in 2022 AND (Fin since 2023 OR DONE=false) )

I understand it's possible to pass a table and some other data types into a python script, but I can't find anything about passing headlines or the content of org files. 
 So in short it'd be cool if I could pass an inline python script a headline :ID: (or its name in the worst case) literate-programming style and then access its child headlines (and maybe even its :PROPERTIES: tags) as a structure to generate a graph from. 
 Does anyone know if this is possible, or if there's a way to achieve something similar? Thanks.

 Alas, running org-protocol needs to be authorized in Firefox. However, it used to ask for permission "once and for all", but after I made a fresh OS install, now Firefox asks for permission on every site I want to run org-protocol in, which is certainly inconvenient.
 I'm not sure the newer OS got me a more recent Firefox version (current is 109.0) for which the policy changed, or if something in my settings was lost along the way. Does anyone else get the same behavior? Does anyone know how to tell Firefox to just run org-protocol whatever the site?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm new to emacs, and still going through a lot of tutorials. I'm trying to make some shortcuts in dired, but I seem to be missing something basic:
 ​
 (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c gdl") '(find-alternate-file "~/downloads")) 
 ​
 When i run this I get an error "Wrong type argument: commandp".
 ​
 Does anyone know what I am doing wrong? Maybe it has something to do with interactive and non-interactive functions (I only do a little coding as a hobby so I haven't learnt about that yet)?
 ​
 Also, I'd rather not use C-c as a prefix, but just use 'g' as a prefix for jumping to shortcuts in dired. Is there a way to set that up?
 ​
 Thanks.

 I also came across this link where the video shows the user's buffer changing to the contents of the file their cursor is hovering over and they can just cycle through the results and see the contents of each automatically. Currently, I use counsel-rg and then I move my cursor to the results, and then press enter to see the contents. I wanted to replicate the effect in the link but I am unsure how to make that happen. The following is the function that I call when using counsel-rg:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am wondering whether the following is possible in Scala:
  
Given some vector x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) in R^n and a function f that maps R^n to R, I would like to replicate this concept in Scala. The idea of Scala's partial function/currying should hold here (i.e. when applying a single value x_i, return a function that is defined only for a subset of its input domain). For example, when n = 2 define f(x, y) = sin(x + y), then trivially, f(2, y) = sin(2 + y).
  
However, the dimension (n > 0) may vary from case to case and may even be provided in input. Partial application for n = 2 is:
 def leftPartialFunction(f: (Double, Double) => Double)(x: Double): Double => Double = f(x, _) 
 but how can this be generalized for arbitrary n?
 For example, how can I apply the function in position i?Something like this I assume would not work ...
 def partialFunction(f: IndexedSeq[Double] => Double)(xi: Double): IndexedSeq[Double] => Double = .... // cannot work well with indexed seq as they are not "disjoint"

 I'm making a project-specific shell each time I make a new project. An example being:  {pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {}, ...}: let projGhc = pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithHoogle (hpkgs: with hpkgs; [ JuicyPixels massiv ]); in pkgs.mkShell { buildInputs = [ pkgs.haskell-language-server projGhc ]; }  I then autoload this shell with lorri/direnv and hls works perfectly with lsp-mode, displaying haddock docs for the packages. But the "Documentation" and "Source" buttons just open an empty buffer. The minibuffer says File not found and directory write-protected.
 For example, trying to get to the docs for massiv's makeArray function opens a buffer titled Data-Massiv-Core.html#v:makeArray, located somewhere in the nix store. Checking, the file Data-Massive-Core.html does exist. However the docs do not show. Is the idea that the docs open in an external browser, or in emacs?

 Basically the title. When I execute the following code in a Julia repl, 
 a=[0 0.5 0.5;0.75 0 0.25;0.75 0.25 0]; print(map(x->getindex(a^3,x),[1,4,7])) 
 I the definition for a is empty, as I've silenced the output with the semicolon.
 However, when I run this code from within org-mode, I get the following output: 
  #+RESULTS: : 3×3 Matrix{Float64}: : 0.0 0.5 0.5 : 0.75 0.0 0.25 : 0.75 0.25 0.0 : [0.1875, 0.40625, 0.40625] 
 That last row is the one I actually wanted to print, whereas the Matrix definition output should definitely not be there.
 I assume one of two things is happening: either org-mode is ignoring the semicolon when it executes the src block, resulting in this error, or julia is wigging out in the org-minibuffer since it's not in a vterm (which apparently matters to julia for some reason).
 I've referred to the julia specific docs, as well as the org-mode evaluation of code blocks and results of code execution docs, with no solution. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

To record timelapses of drawings, just use the camera with the left hand while you paint with the right and record a couple of seconds.
Paul Heaston (@paulheaston) shared on Instagram that he's not using tools to hold his camera while he's recording sketches most of the time instead of using a table mount.
Usually, he picks up the phone mid-sketch with the left hand, draws with the right, and records the drawing process for a couple of seconds only to capture something interesting on video. Finally, combine the clips into 1 video.]]></summary>

 or use MaybeT like
 (>>=?) :: Monad m => m (Maybe a) -> (a -> m (Maybe b)) -> m (Maybe b) xm >>=? f = runMaybeT $ do x <- MaybeT xm MaybeT $ f x 
 but the pattern seems common enough that I feel like there would be a "best practice" or accepted way to do so, or some existing operator, that I'm unaware of. It also feels like there should be some way to generalize Maybe to any instance of MonadFail but I haven't been able to figure that out.
 Is there a less verbose way of doing this, or are the two options above what I should stick with, or are there existing implementation(s) somewhere in some library/libraries that are accepted as the idiomatic way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So emacs has mainlined eglot, it is apparently the future default emacs language server client. I tried switching over from lspmode to eglot, however it was missing the very helpful Haskell Language Server (HLS) type hints. The ones where you type a function without a signature, and it suggests, correctly most of the time, the most generic constraint or typing for what you are trying to do. Does anybody know how to get such behaviour with eglot/HLS?
 Thanks

I am unsure why this may have happened (and the fact is, I can add in the emojis but the file is a bit broke at the moment.
 Eg. 🐧 to \360\237\220\247 
 Is there any particular reason why this would have happened, and more to the point, is there a way to prevent it? (I should point out I'm on OSX and these were default emoji from Apple's font.). It's the first time I've seen it happen in files (though I recently changed my config which, for example, removed the Apple emoji front from being defaulted.). I'm on emacs 29.0.60. Latest version of org-mode and using org-roam.

To be honest, I'm finding it has only one advantage over ALE + Vim + the now defunct Intero – namely, it offers auto-completion – and has a number of drawbacks (no way to get a variable's type, that I can see, and requires an entire Node.js installation). Is there some killer feature of HLS that I'm missing?
 tbh, most of what I'd want out of HLS can already be got from ghci (using the :type-at and :loc-at commands), so I'm thinking of writing a small Vim plugin to hook ghci into Vim similar to what Intero did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using eglot for coding c++, which is lightweight and provides just enough functionalities for me (Glad it's integrated into emacs 29!)
 One thing I'm not 100% satisfied is the diagnostics when the cursor is hovering on a symbol. By default it shows the information in the echo area through eldoc, which is not quite convenient because usually it's far from where the cursor is. A better solution is provided by eldoc-box, which shows information in a child frame, like this.
 As can be seen in the screenshot, the child frame blocks some part of the window. I'm wondering if possible to set the child frame transparent so that I can see the code below. I tried to set eldoc-box-frame-parameters with (alpha . 0.5) but it has no effect. What do I miss?
 Moreover, the eglot shows the information with some formatting. There is a long line separating different kinds of information, which is fine for the echo area, but in the child frame, it is wrapped into several pieces, occupying additional lines. I'm curious if there is a way to change the format. 
 Another question which is related is that the documentation is truncated. I'd rather to see a long child frame to show all the information, which is usually possible if there is no redundant things like the wrapped line. I cannot find an option in eglot to turn off the truncation. Is there any solution for this problem?
 Thanks for reading this long post!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm trying to setup my emacs to edit markdown files. Ideally I'd like to have links, emphasis, images, equations, etc. previewed inline when the point is not inside them, and displayed as raw source code when the point is inside them (the functionality provided in org-mode by org-appear and org-fragtog).
 Does anyone have a setup like this? I found this, but I'm wondering if there's a solution that works per fragment instead of per line (and isn't a "quick and dirty proof of concept", as the author describes it).
 Thanks!
 edit: add links to org-appear and org-fragtog

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Emacs 28 was about to come out, I remember John Wiegley said something like it took on average about 30 minutes for a user to natively compile it. Later on I also came across one online article saying it takes a lot more time to do native compilation.
 But according to my experience, on my mediocre desktop, it probably takes less than 10 minutes for native compilation. And I wonder if I'm doing it in a correct way. I run `./configure --with-native-compilation` then `make -j$(nproc)`. I also tried `make NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1 -j$(nproc)` per EmacsWiki. But the compilation time is always very well under 10 minutes. After compilation, the evaluation of (native-comp-available-p) returns t.
 Am I doing it correctly or am I missing something?

 Here TxGVNN/guxti is my Guix channel to maintain packages and patches.
 Pros
  
Patches are centrally stored, easy to see what is patch and don't need to fork any source to modify.
 Reproducible, I can roll back any point (time traveling).
 It will be easy to install package need external libs like vterm, telega(Telegram client), tree-sitter,...
 Build your ELPA by elpa-mirror power tool. I exported to my giaelpa TxGVNN/giaelpa@master, so it still works well for my dotfiles without GUIX
 Keep working with use-package style.
 With guix pack --format=deb I can install all of them (emacs version, packages, 3rd libs) on debian machine without GUIX
 When cloud IDEs are using more (Gitpod, Codespace), it helps me to a certain uniform environment. I implement on my Gitpod dotfiles, you can have a look TxGVNN/gitpod@701546
  
Cons
  
Heavy and slow, I think

I want it to be a vertically-displayed completing-read menu over some sources (recent files, recent buffers, bookmarks, etc.). I can write the completion command easily enough (and I already use vertico, so I would get the standard vertical display), but I want the completion candidates to fill the a whole window, a bit like vertico-buffer does. Importantly, I only want this to happen for this one thing -- the dashboard -- I don't just want to enable vertico-buffer generally. If I switch to another buffer and invoke a minibuffer command, it should show up at the bottom like usual.
 It would be really great if invoking any minibuffer-using command while in the dashboard buffer would reuse the dashboard buffer for completion, but that might be a separate issue.

 Over time Emacs has seen useful standard library additions, for example additional string-* functions or the new keymap-* functions in Emacs 29. Compat provides many of these new functions and closes the gap between Emacs core development and package development outside of Emacs, since new Emacs additions become available early for all package developers.
 Packages outside of Emacs core can be written in the same style as Emacs core packages by relying on Compat. Vice versa Emacs core packages can use Compat for their separate GNU …]]></summary>

 I have two ideas to install this package:
  
git clone to one of the load-paths and just use-package. cons: I need install the dependencies first.
 use straight.el (maybe? I just start to read its long readme).
  
Then I find there is a ejira/ejira-pkg.el file in the repo, is that the package definations? Can I use this file directly to install the ejira with all its dependencies automaticly?

 manager' <- newManager defaultManagerSettings res <- runClientM (<object> :: ClientM Type) (mkClientEnv manager' <url>) 
 where <object> is some big tree like structure which needs many requests to build. The problem is that the lichess API is rate limited (here they say: only one request at a time and wait for a minute after receiving 429). Is there a way to slow down servant-client (or http-client) so that they obey these restrictions?
 I haven't found anything in the docs of servant-client or http-client, and googling only gives result for the server side part. servant-rate-limit has a client module, but when you look at the code you see that it doesn't do anything. managerConnCount and managerIdleConnectionCount don't help either.

 ie instead of being (a b c d e) I accidentally made it ((a b) a b c d e) and the problem was easily fixed by (setq savehist-additional-variables (cdr savehist-additional-variables)). However this was only possible because the(a b)` was the head of the list.
 The functions delete|remove, delq | remq remove an element from the list, with the former using equal to compare and the latter eq to compare.
 According to the docs equal

eq
  
Return t if the two args are the same Lisp object.
  
(delete '(a b) ((a b) a b c d e) works and (delq '(a b) ((a b) a b c d e)) doesn't.
 Why do eq and equal treat the (a b)/'(a b) comparison differently?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! For some time I've been developing a package to integrate the TMSU file tagging system with Emacs and dired. While I find TMSU great, I didn't really like its UI, so I've turned Emacs into a subjectively better one.
 https://github.com/vifon/tmsu.el
 While not a full replacement for more intricate TMSU CLI use cases, tmsu.el handles all the regular workflows such as tagging, tag modification and tag based queries (with results in dired, similar to M-x find-dired).
 It was one of my goals to integrate tmsu.el with the Emacs ecosystem as well as possible:
  
tag editing uses the standard completing-read-multiple (or any frontend to it, such as vertico)
 most dired features are usable in the query results
 the queries can be saved both with the Emacs-native bookmarks (C-x r m) and the org-mode links (M-x org-store-link)
  
Here is a screenshot of an example query made with M-x tmsu-dired-query:
 https://preview.redd.it/m3frsus24fda1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1bbe0270074bf8186bb416fb86c6529d3ba4d866
 tmsu.el was usable for quite a while, but only recently I've published it as a separate project (previously it was just living in my ~/.emacs.d/) and consider its feature set relatively complete and stable. Hopefully someone else will find it as useful as I do!
 Any further input is very appreciated.

 In this post I’ll describe how to write a minimalistic Haskell persistence layer (on top of HDBC). My approach will rely heavily on Generics (Data.Data, Data.Typeable) and Reflection (Type.Reflection).
 The overall design goal is to avoid any boilerplate code for the API user.
 The library is by no means complete. Right now it’s just a proof of concept. But it shows that it is possible to use Generics to eliminate a lot of handwritten code for API users.
 I’m explicitely asking for your feedback here:
  
Do you regard such a persistence library as useful?
 Do you have any suggestions for improvements?
 Which feature would you like to see most urgently?
 Do you think it makes sense to extend this proof of concept to a full fledged solution, or are there already enough libraries out there that do the same?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see that a lot of people have moved into org mode, and say org mode is amazing as task management solution. So I've been convinced org mode is the ideal task management tool for geek.
 Then I discover that org mode miss some essential basic feature for task management. For instance, I estimated the effort for a project. After finishing some tasks, I try to track the remaining effort to complete the project. I discover that there is no straightforward solution to do that in org column view, org column view can only display estimated effort. I should write a custom function for this basic and essential feature of task management. No built-in solution or elisp package exists for that. Only a advanced emacs user (who masters elisp) can do this basic and essential action. I suppose probably that it exists maybe other basic and essential feature aren't implemented in org mode.
 That make me to doubt when so many people says org mode is a amazing task management tool. Did they used really org mode in production for task management? I can't understand how people can survive in task management without such feature.
 Org mode is maybe a good platform to build a task management tool, but it isn't a mature task management tool.
 Fortunately,org can export to taskjuggler, I intent to explore the taskjuggler solution.

 Is bringing up Todos with priority A, but also those with no priority. I can filter those no priority ones out with an org-agenda-skip-entry-if command (notregexp to drop anything that’s not explicitly [#A]) but that seems like it should be unnecessary.
 And then, I can’t figure out how to show anything due today/overdue with no priority in a separate search. What’s the best command for that?
 Any thoughts for me?
 —-SORT OF SOLVED—-
 I set the default priority to “D” (which is not one of the priorities I cycle through) and set up a search for that priority. Not sure if that’s the orthodox solution, but it works.

 I left some notes in the Elisp so you can figure out where to customize further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a mathematics graduate student who has been dabbling with Emacs for a little under a year, on and off. I have the following use case, and I've felt a little overwhelmed at the possible choices of packages, so I'd like some advice on how to set up something that works for me.
 In my studies I often find myself encountering problems and ideas that I had thought about a long time ago, but can no longer reconstruct. What I'd like to create is a system where I can dash off my summary of a theorem or proof technique that I encounter, and be able to link these documents to each other. More specifically, I'd like to have a big folder filled with LaTeX files (or org files) that are tagged somehow so I don't have to keep track of them myself. I want to be able to refer to specific theorems/definitions/equations in other files in the system, as I would in LaTeX. And, importantly, I want to be able to produce a nicely formatted PDF from a selection of these files, with all the internal links to equations, definitions etc. working properly. So for example if this semester I'm studying harmonic analysis, I want to produce notes on all the theorems and techniques I pick up, and by the end I should be able to stitch them together in a PDF. If next semester something I'm studying relies on one of those theorems, I want to still be able to point to the corresponding file and again include it in a different PDF. A nice plus would be the ability to smoothly manage citations and references to books, papers etc.
 There are packages in the so-called personal knowledge management ecosystem (org-roam, deft, org-brain, Zetteldeft etc.) that seem to do what I'm looking for. I'd appreciate anyone who's tried out a bunch of them giving their opinion on what makes the most sense to do. If anyone's done something similar, any advice, links or helpful blog posts describing your setup would be very appreciated.

I would like to make the days of the week different colored, but since conky is just reading the file it's not possible (at least I couldn't do it, please tell me I'm wrong)
 The TODO and priority levels are really annoying (this is easier to deal with, but still)
 I have multiple files for different tasks. While I do want all the tasks to be listed and, when I'm on agenda view, from which file they come from, again, is really annoying on conky
  
Have any of you guys dealt with this before? How would you implement that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I was wondering if there is a better way to determine the directory location for an elisp script.
 When running as a script I used (file-name-directory load-file-name), but that is nil when running the file with eval-buffer etc.. So for those cases I use the default-directory variable. This is my current solution:
  (defun my/get-script-directory () (if (null load-file-name) (expand-file-name default-directory) (file-name-directory load-file-name)) 
 My main concern is that default-directory does not always point to the same directory that the file is in since it can be changed with cd. 
 Thanks in advance!

 I am looking for the functionality like a search box on this page: https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/search.html?q=test&check_keywords=yes&area=default
 EDIT: both search or fuzzy search functionality will be great to have.
 EDIT2: I found org-info-js which is said to be outdated. 
 Ideally to be used across several subpages, beyond the way Read-The-Org simple wiki page layout. Use case: for knowledge base building, and quick access. I explain something to a co-worker and, using their computer, I can quickly search a topic I am explaining, and this topic is present on my website with my openly available notes.
 I could not see a search box in the pages generated from org to html.Someone said a few years ago that this required JavaScript to run, and that was not a feature of org to html conversion at a time.
 What are the solutions today?Thank you for your help and support. Please point me to right direction if I missed something obvious.

I know I need to add a funcall and I'd get that for places where I get passed a procedure from a variable or something but this is a macro. Those should get expanded before evaluation, so why if -cut expands to the exact same code does it behave differently in this case? And do ELisp macros have more quirks other lisps' don't?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, been using emacs and Org Mode for a few years now. global-auto-revert-mode used to work fine -- if I changed a file remotely, the emacs process would pick it up and revert that file's buffer.
 Around 6 months or so ago it became only 'intermittently' working... maybe 1 out of 5 or 10 times, it will notice the file has changed and revert the buffer. Most of the time (almost always) it doesn't. I find myself now doing 'C-x x g' to revert by hand, before I start modifying my Org agenda, otherwise I'll have a conflict when I try to save.
 I have this in my .emacs:
 '(global-auto-revert-mode t)
 I have also tried it with '1' instead of 't' but made no difference.
 My setup is:
 - Fedora 37 as a Virtualbox VM (running under a Windows 10 host)
 - emacs version 28.2
 - file in question is being synchronized via Syncthing (the remote device is an Android phone, as my main use case is Orgzly)
 I've done some searching but haven't found an answer for this scenario so far. Can anyone give some pointers on what else I might look for, or any means of directly troubleshooting this?

 (setq default-frame-alist '((top + -334) (left + -3769) (width . 230) (height . 75))) (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 230 75) 
 The result is it pops from the laptop to the main monitor, but the height is clipped to the height of the laptop. And the minibuffer and modeline are gone/hidden, like the bottom of the frame is truly clipped. Any meaningful interaction in this state, like expanding an org headline, results in a crash/core dump.
 I need to drag the bottom a bit with the mouse to snap emacs out of it and get the minibuffer back and leave the crash-ready state.
 Executing the set-frame works fine when the frame is already on the second monitor, but i can recreate the same issue by moving the window to the laptop and executing the size and then dragging the window back.
 Anyone experience this? Ideas for a fix? Thankyou for any info.

 I would like to tell helm~ag to ignore showing files that have the extension ".org_archive", and probably later also ".html".
 Based off the sample configuration on the github readme...
 (custom-set-variables '(helm-ag-base-command "ag --nocolor --nogroup --ignore-case") '(helm-ag-command-option "--all-text") '(helm-ag-insert-at-point 'symbol) '(helm-ag-ignore-buffer-patterns '("\\.txt\\'" "\\.mkd\\'"))) 
 ... I figured that that would require me to add the following to my emacs init.el file:
 (custom-set-variables '(helm-ag-ignore-buffer-patterns '("\\.org_archive\\'" "\\.html\\'")) '(helm-ag-ignore-patterns '("\\.org_archive\\'" "\\.html\\'")) ) 
 I probably don't need both. However this doesn't seem to be true. I.E. it doesn't exclude those files, although I do see my customisations via customize-group.
 Can someone please tell me what I'm failing to understand?

 I sometimes accidentally create new captures with wrong inputs by mistake or choose the wrong template. I then try to abort the capture process (C-c C-k or org-capture-kill). Unfortunately, this still creates an empty file for that capture and performs a find-file on it. 
 I added :no-save t to my templates (inspired by this thread), but this makes aborted captures' buffers to stay open. Adding :kill-buffer t somehow causes org-capture to write the file to disk on abort (ignoring :no-save t). 
 Is there a way to not create an empty file and to close the capture buffer when aborting an org-capture process?

 I'm looking for a Scala counterpart to Haskell's constructor sequential application, and it's surprisingly difficult to find a documentation page where this topic would be covered. Basically, I'm looking for a way to achieve this in Scala:
 ```haskell data Object = Object Int String deriving Show
 main = print object where object = Object <$> Just 1 <*> Just "one" ```
 If it isn't supported by the core language, I'd appreciate links to libraries implementing this functionality via FP primitives.

 I'm currently trying to switch from Neovim (with a Neochad-based config) to a from-scratch Emacs. I'm pretty happy with my config, but I'm uncomfortable with the C-? and M-? way of doing things in Emacs. Since I employ Evil for everything, could I change to a <Leader>? based config to reduce stress on the finger joints. Ergonomics is very important to me. 
 I saw many plugins promising it, but I wondered what the right way of implementing this is. 
 Thanks for your help :)

 I am currently intensely looking for my first job position as a developer where I will work with python and Django.
 My question is - should I mention in my CV and be proud of that I am using Emacs as my text/code-editor/note taking app/calendar/etc, because that will show, that I like to tweak things not only for work, but for my own pleasure, I don't feel the need to use what everyone else is using, I like to understand the tools that I am using, I value efficiency(after using emacs for almost a few years, I can not imagine writing code and using my mouse or arrow keys often) and etc... 
 Or... it will show that I am weird for using some ancient editor and it's going to be too hard to blend me in a team of other developers using vscode and stuff.
 Curious to know what you think.

 There I was also visually adviced to write an elevator pitch to quickly explain the central point (thanks, u/tonicinhibition). You can read that here now: Project Mage: The Elevator Pitch.

 Does M-x org-roam-capture-templates RET support to have a key to create directories?
 It would be good to have something like M-x org-roam-node-find RET p RET active RET paper RET, where p corresponds to some template and a projects directory.
 Now there is another problem, when one does
 mv projects/active/paper.org projects/done/paper.org 
 org-roam-node-find would not find paper.org. Edit: nevermind, had to org-roam-db-clear-all and org-roam-db-sync.
 TLDR how to have an org-roam-template choice with a recursive directory/filename choice? Found out, that I can move files in my org-roam-directory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was using neovim - but had some issues related to indentation that I couldn't fix, and the community also seemed to agree that it was a known issue, and so I moved to using doom emacs.
 ​
 So I moved to doom emacs - tested the indentation, and it was flawless, exactly how I wanted it to perform.
 ​
 What I want, which was working:
 - If I open a block, auto indent ready for typing based on where the block currently is
 - If I delete all indentation in front of a line, and hit tab, autoindent that line to it's correct indent level
 - If I have a line indented correctly, and hit backspace at the beginning of that line, remove 1 indentation (even if this would be incorrect to what is expected)
 - If I have a line indented correctly, and I tab at the beginning of the line, indent that line once (even if this would be incorrectly indented)
 ​
 This is pretty much exactly how VSCode handles indentation for PHP, it's very practical and flexible.
 ​
 I want to know how I can get back to this, because today after opening my emacs, if I hit tab, the editor will just check if the line is correctly indented, and fix it as per it's own opinion. 
 I do not want this aggressive style of controlling indentation, because it is not at all practical of what I actually need from emacs
 ​
 For context - I work on an eCommerce site, the entire project is 7 million lines of code, and not one single file has been well mantained - some of the files are 30 thousand lines long.
 ​
 Of course - one option would be to try and indent the entire file, but then I can't get my PRs approved on GitHub.
 ​
 Accepting the aggressive indentation is not an option for me, I need to be able to have flexible control over it.
 ​
 Can anyone suggest ideas for this?
 ​
 Currently, C-h k is set to c-indent-line-or-region

 many Emacs users don't use eshell very much.
 Many users of other shells, are not familiar with eshell's features and capabilities.
 On a Slovak Linux site a while ago I published an article about eshell, aimed at a wider audience who don't use Emacs, and I mentioned some of the features that make it interesting and attractive.
 Maybe it makes sense for English-speaking users (of PC, Linux), so I made a translation of it (note: English is not my native language, so please forgive mistakes and awkward expressions).
 (BTW: I use eshell as a daily tool and I can't imagine going back to another shell. )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm evaluating scala3 for the type of applications I do (business logic in logistics, e-commerce) and I'm looking to scratch an itch I've been having with other languages and their ecosystems.
 First some definitions
  
a clean domain model is a package/module/layer which does not depend on anything but the language and itself
 no external libraries, in-line annotations (eg javadoc) or off-line annotations (eg xml) are allowed in the domain model
 the domain model can provide contracts that other models/modules can implement in order to pass data into the domain model; data can also be injected by constructing model entities outside of the model and passing them as parameters to the model
  
With all this in mind, I landed at the first candidate: slick from https://scala-slick.org/ that you all probably know.
 Given my requirements, I have an issue with the example on their front page
  class Coffees(tag: Tag) extends Table[Coffee](tag, "COFFEES") { 
 because their abstraction requires me to pass into the model an abstraction specific to the library (a table), but I need to pass into the model the Coffee type defined above (supposedly defined in the domain model).
 Basically the extends gets in the way. I would envision my requirement being met if the slick abstractions would be mixins, and my class StorableCoffee would extend Coffee and mix into itself the storage features from slick.
 Then I would be able to pass into the domain model StorableCoffee, but to the model that would just be a Coffee.
 So since I've never coded in scala, my questions are:
  
is it possible to achieve my goal without convoluted scala3 artifacts and slick or another library?
 if not, what are the possible hacks I could employ?

 type DbQuery = Text

 getConfig :: m DbConfig
 My aim was with it to read data from db use the readDb method and return with any type.
 I would like to determine the exact type where I create the instance of that class.
 the implementation:
 data DbRow = DbRow Int Text deriving (Show)
 instance FromRow DbRow where
 fromRow = DbRow <$> field <*> field
 instance Db IO where
 readDb queryStr = do
 sqlitePath <- dbPath <$> getConfig
 conn <- open sqlitePath
 let q = read (unpack queryStr) :: Query
 res <- query_ conn q :: IO [DbRow]
 close conn
 return res
 I got this error:
 typecheck [-Wdeferred-type-errors]: • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘DbRow’
 Expected: IO [a]
 Actual: IO [DbRow]
 ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
 the type signature for:
 readDb :: forall a. DbQuery -> IO [a]
 at /home/lajbo/Projects/haskell-projects/test1/src/DbImpl.hs:17:3-8
 Please clarify what I dont' understand and why the DbRow is not Any type ...

 Of late, I do not know why, but the hard disk space on my Windows machine is close to being fully utilized. I notice that there are multiple apps that seem to be updating by default -- such as Acrobat reader, McAfee Software, Browser Updates, etc. 
 I am considering emacs and was wondering if emacs has this issue at all? I believe that there is a pdf reader built in, web browser built in, etc.
 So, hypothetically, if one were to install emacs, what other Windows applications can be removed -- Acrobat reader. Chrome / Microsoft Edge browser, etc.?
 What Windows applications are hard to replicate in emacs? Can people here tell me which Windows applications you still have to use after installing emacs?
 Thank you.

I see plenty of posts share abstract advice for linking Zettels together and implementing Folgezettel.
Each link should create knowledge
Create a new Zettel when you're starting to branch into a second idea
"Find" Zettels that match your topic (but don't you dare use the Search function to do it!)
You need Folgezettel / you don't need Folgezettel (I personally like the structure, so I've chosen to keep it)
What I'd like to learn from experienced users is this: What are the PHYSICAL steps you take when you've completed a Zettel and you're linking it to your other Zettels?
By physical steps, I mean what you actually do, GTD-style Next Actions.
For instance, here's my physical action steps.
Search my index for the topic of interest
Look within that cluster to find a Zettel that's either a source of that idea or similar to that idea.
Number the new Zettel after the one I chose from #2.
Use the Obsidian search function for a few keywords within my Zettel to find relevant links, adding context phrases as I do so.
But the problem is that as my Slipbox grows, I'll slowly forget the Zettel clusters and may make less-than-ideal connections. Any guidance here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!]]></summary>

Scholar and historian S.D. Goitein built and maintained a significant collection of over 27,000 notes in the form of a card index (or zettelkasten1) which he used to fuel his research and academic writing output in the mid to late twentieth century. The collection was arranged broadly by topical categories and followed in the commonplace book tradition though it was maintained on index cards. Uncommon to the space, his card index file was used by subsequent scholars for their own research and was ultimately digitized by the Princeton Geniza Project.

  (defun that () "newvalue") `(defvar ,(make-symbol (that)) 10 "a docstring") 
 evaluation the second line results in
 (defvar newvalue 10 "anothername") 
 which I want to execute directly.
 What command should I wrap around the defvar to execute it directly?
 I'm also looking the eval function which seems to be the way to execute valid elisp like the generated defvar above after it has been converted to a string.
 Can the same thing be done in an eval way?
 PS. After scratching my head a bit and remembering a few things such print being what you had to do to read stuff and chancing across some old stuff this is what I have come up with.
 (defun my/eval-string (string) "Eval elisp code of STRING." (eval (car (read-from-string (format "(progn %s)" string))))) (my/eval-string (prin1-to-string `(defvar ,(make-symbol (that)) 10 "another name"))) 
 It works fine but isn't there a simpler way? This seems convoluted.
 It must be possible to execute the expansion of `(defvar ,(make-symbol (that)) 10 "another name") without converting it to string prefixed with progn, reading it and executing it again.

What I'm Working On
I've fallen into a rabbit hole. I'm programming a ZK tool for The Archive that will bring notes together in a way that exposes their connecting ideas. Looking at the history of this project, it is something I've been working on and off again for a year, and it is so close to releasing into the wild, I'm having a hard time sleeping. We'll see.
11 New Zettel in the Last 7 Days.
Titles and one-sentence summary/meaning of atomic zettel. These are the ideas I'm currently wrestling with. They represent a 7-day window of new notes.
This is generated with nothing held back. I can use help. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list or answer any questions. If any of this is of interest to you, please start a thread here, DM me, or get in touch via email.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is my org-mode file foo.org:
 | Category | Points | |-----------+--------| | Minecraft | 13 | | Tetris | 6 | | Bricks | 1 | |-----------+--------| | | 20 | #+TBLFM: @>$2=vsum(@I..@II) | Game | No | |--------+----| | Mario | 1 | | Pacman | 1 | | Zork | 1 | |--------+----| | | 3 | #+TBLFM: @>$2=vcount(@I..@II) 
 I place the point somewhere inside the 1st table and press C-c *. Nothing happens. This is good.
 Then I place the point somewhere inside the 2nd table and press C-c *. It gets misaligned like this:
 | Category | Points | |-----------+--------| | Minecraft | 13 | | Tetris | 6 | | Bricks | 1 | |-----------+--------| | | 20 | #+TBLFM: @>$2=vsum(@I..@II) | Game | No | |--------+----| | Mario | 1 | | Pacman | 1 | | Zork | 1 | |--------+----| | | 3 | #+TBLFM: @>$2=vcount(@I..@II) 
 It looks like it mistakenly took a column width of 8 for the last row, 2nd column. I suspect that this column width of 8 has been mistakenly taken from the column width of the 2nd column of the first table which is also 8.
 Following my suspicion I try a different experiment now. I press TAB on the 2nd table to realign. Then I place point somewhere in the 1st table and type C-c * and now the 1st table gets misaligned like so:
 | Category | Points | |-----------+--------| | Minecraft | 13 | | Tetris | 6 | | Bricks | 1 | |-----------+--------| | | 20 | #+TBLFM: @>$2=vsum(@I..@II) | Game | No | |--------+----| | Mario | 1 | | Pacman | 1 | | Zork | 1 | |--------+----| | | 3 | #+TBLFM: @>$2=vcount(@I..@II) 
 You see it has incorrectly set the column width of last row, 2nd column to 4 which is also the column width of 2nd column of 1st table.
 Is this expected behavior? Or is this a bug? Any workarounds to prevent this kind of misalignment from happening?

 I read about #+STARTUP: but it does not support executing arbitrary elisp code. So how can I modify my org file such that it always runs (make-list) on startup.

 Recently I've created a simple guitar fretboard cheatsheet for Emacs. I don't know how many guitar beginners we have in the Emacs community, but maybe someone will find it useful. See the screenshot on Github to get the idea of what it does.
 Currently it depends on symbol-overlay.el for simplicity, but this dependency probably will be replaced with calls to highlight-regexp.
 Don't hesitate to say what additional functionality would make sense, assuming it wouldn't be too difficult to add.

 import Data.Aeson import Data.ByteString.Lazy (ByteString) encode :: ToJSON a => a -> ByteString 
 I read many articles specifying that lazy Text and lazy ByteString are not to be used or should be used in very few specific situations. So, what advantage does it bring for aeson to use lazy version?
 Also, as far as I know ByteString is binary data, so when aeson encodes the some record to a JSON string, how does it know that it should use UTF-8 instead of something else? Is it the default behavior? Is there some way I can specify the character encoding behavior when using aeson for decoding and encoding a record?

Maybe the idea is not well formulated. So I rewrote the post to better explain my idea.
 Core idea
 In org, The TODO keyword expresses an expectation (we want realize something); when it changes to DONE, the expectation is met. But the org mode does not have the concept of whether we have enough resources to achieve the expectation and how to consistently allocate them. In tasks management, I think budgeting a project, and analyzing its feasibility and cost, task allocation is essential.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there an easy way to have my orgmode agenda respect regular orgmode formatting, such as +thing+ being a strike-through format? Right now I can format the title and, though it looks decorated in the input view, it is unadorned in the agenda view and I just see the raw plus signs or other markups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by Nicolas Rougier's mu4e-dashboard, I tried to create a similar dasboard for my org-agenda. The links in the dashboard open an agenda search window in the middle window, which by default shows a weekly agenda. This combined with the side window on the right (mostly taken from Rougier's task agenda) makes for a rather nice setup, I believe.

 on two of my systems simply starting emacs seens to have resulted in packages being updated and that resulted in in the "Invalid function: org-assert-version`, my installation is currently broken.
 The workaround seems to be to start emacs with -Q and reinstall org but I don't know how to do that.
 I have tried (with emacs -Q) to configure the melpa-client but when I then try to run (package-install 'org) it simply says "org is already installed".
 How to proceed?
 Many thanks!

 I'm a university student, and am out and about more than I am home, lately, and at times, when I want to play with an idea, or practice some concepts, I typically have to wait until I'm home to open up a project specifically for that purpose.
 I've looked around, but haven't found anything regarding whether or not it is possible to use codespaces for Haskell. 
 Does anyone know whether it is possible? Additionally, does anyone have a repo I can clone for this purpose, or a resource to explain the setup?
 Thanks, all!
 Edit: my main issue is that I require ghcup, and the extension in vscode doesn't work like it normally would out if the box.

And large texts get somewhat fatiguing to scan vs serif fonts. 
 For people who are doing lots of writing in org-mode, particularly professional writers, bloggers, or scientists and who abuse proportional rather than fixed font, I'd be curious as to what people is working for people (and why).

 Rates - from $45/hr w2( VERY junior) up to $100/hr w2 depending on the seniority level of the role. 
 The projects are cool, a lot of one and done interviews, but so many fraudulent candidates out there its hard to find the folks actually in need of work right now online.

itself to static analysis. These are all “good things” for building
robust software, which inevitably lead us to using languages such as
Haskell, OCaml and Rust. However, it would be remiss of us to snub
languages that don’t enforce the same disciplines, but are nonetheless
popular choices in industry. Ivory towers are lonely places, after all.
Last time I wrote about how Python’s1 type system

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a CLAP audio plugin host for Haskell and running into issues when trying to use the C FFI on Windows. The same code works on Linux, so I'm assuming this is a longstanding Windows issue given all the warnings I've seen about using Haskell on Windows. And the same thing happens on every GHC version I've tried (8.8.4, 8.10.7, 9.2.5, and 9.4.4).
 The error message is `Access violation in generated code when executing data at 0x7ffd3aa06366` with a stack trace that points to an invocation of a method inside a struct field. The weird thing is that if I call the same method in the same Haskell function that the struct is created, it works fine. Which makes it sound like the struct got destroyed or relocated in memory. But if I print the C struct's address and the address of all of its method field, they're exactly the same as when it was created.
 My first thought was that the garbage collector had freed up its space, but that shouldn't be possible since there is a persistent reference to the struct stored in an `IORef`. And using `StablePtr` didn't have any impact.
 Anyone run into something like this before, or have better ideas how to debug it? And if not, where would be a better place to report this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I would like to understand something about elisp that I have now struggled with for days and simpy cannot figure out - so I hope for some wizzard here...
 This is part of my configuration (it' about replacing the language-names of source-blocks with svgs - but that is not what this posting is about):
 (setq svg-tag-tags '( ("#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(elisp\\)" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) ("#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(perl\\)" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) ) ) 
 As you can see the lambda expression for the languages is exactly the same in both cases, so I wondered if it was possible to factor that out and try something like this:
 ​
  (fset #'mh/myl (lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)) (setq svg-tag-tags '( ("#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(elisp\\)" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) ("#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(perl\\)" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) ("#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(python\\)" . (#'mh/myl) ) ) 
 So the idea is to store the lambda in the function-slot of a symbol and then use that symbol instead of the lambda but for reasons that are beyond me it does not work. (If it worked for python you would of course use this approach for all the other languages as well and then would only need to update one place should you ever want to change the appearence of the svgs).
 I have tried every conceivable permutation of quoting (or not quoting), of sprinkling in some call to symbol-function etc but I cannot make it work. Some variations compile fine but in the end none of them work.
 And I wonder: Why does this not work? What is it that I do not understand about symbols and lambdas?
 And what would be the proper way to do that (provided it is possible at all)?
 Many thanks!

 It allows everyone (since 2022, before that it was only students) to contribute to projects for a stipend. However, in order to do that, we need to have some ideas of what to contribute to.
 In the past, this has led to many improvements for GHC, Cabal, HLS, Hasktorch... and it can include your project as well! This is a great way to find contributors for your project (even after the summer ends) -- many past participants have become involved long-term.

 , get char and write value to cell currently pointed at

 without problem, but when trying to implement the loops I got stuck, more specifically, when handling nested loops and the accumulated instructions (one-layer loops are executed correctly at the moment).

 in elisp if I have '(+ 1 1)' and i have the cursor on the last ')' C-xC-e will give me 2.
 however in cider running eval last sexp on the ending ')' will only evaluate the sexp one char to the left of the ')', in this case 1. to get it to eval 2 I'd need to jump one char to the right with my cursor, ie outside of the ')', is this intentional?

 I'm looking for a library to read / write on any process memory in Scala.
 In node, we have "memoryjs" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/memoryjs) for example that does that rather easily (drop a package.json with one dependecy, and you are up and running !).
 Is there any librabry available that can do that in Scala (I've juste spent one hour searching on the net without success ...) ? Thanks ! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been learning Haskell with the dream of developing beatiful functional models. I've gone through the exercise of models from scratch. I am now interested in porting over some of my deep learning models from PyTorch. For this to work, I would want automatic differentiation and GPU execution. I've peeked at Hasktorch and the Tensorflow Haskell bindings, but I'm really interested in the slick interface of the backprop package. I'm not sure if it's a viable path given the repo has posted issues regarding GHC 9.0 and accelerate compatibility. Does anyone have recent experience with backprop and accelerate? Are there alternative recommendations for automatic differentiation?

Exercise 7.1. Write the Functor and Monad instances for Either e. By convention, a successful return value is encoded by Right.
  
My implementation following the other examples in the book:
 data Either e r = Left e | Right r instance Functor (Either e) where -- fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b fmap _ (Left x) = Left x fmap f (Right x) = Right (f x) instance Applicative (Either e) where -- pure :: a -> f a pure = Right -- (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b Right f <*> Right x = Right (f x) _ <*> Left x = Left x instance Monad (Either e) where -- return :: a -> m a return = pure -- (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b Right x >>= f = f x Left x >>= _ = Left x 
 But I don't understand why the instances are defined using only one type e where the constructor has two types, e and r.

But I find it really hard to avoid the increasing right indentation without making the code hard to understand because of runExceptT and the likes everywhere. To give you a bit more info before clicking the repository link: in the actual app, m would be the application monad (think ReaderT pattern), and so you might often see m (Maybe String) or m (Either String) being returned. It's then hard to compose two functions like that. I'm aware that you can do MonadPlus m and MonadError String m but I can't get this to work while still preserving the error messages depending on where I got a Nothing value.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I noticed on this post mention of Meta decommissioning Sigma, their spam fighting tool, which is written in Haskell.
 If true, this news is very bad, since it's an example of a major corporation we can no longer point to and say, 'See! Haskell is used in industry!' And it's quite likely I'll have to write more weakly typed PHP and JS code, as a result as clients will refuse to take Haskell seriously.
 So does anyone know if this is true? Does anyone have any links?
 Apologies for making a new post about this, I didn't get to comment on the other one in a timely manner.

 Until now, the Tour of Scala repo has always been open source (https://github.com/leobenkel/tour-of-scala) but only regarding the design. The articles were hosted on my own website and just displayed differently on Tour of Scala but not editable by anyone.
 As of today, all the content is also open source!
 💻 Every exercises can be edited by opening a PR on those files (https://github.com/leobenkel/tour-of-scala/tree/main/pages/scala)
 I am looking forward to seeing everyone involved in this community fixing minor mistakes that I could have let slip in, adding more content, adding exercises for Scala 3, for ZIO, and more challenges, and adding new features! 🎉

 I'm happy to announce the second part of a five part tutorial on property-based testing stateful systems in general, and distributed systems in particular:
 https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial/blob/main/docs/Part02ConcurrentSMTesting.md#readme
 In the previous part we introduced state machine testing building only upon QuickCheck.
 In this part we will build upon the first part and add concurrent state machine testing support and linearisability checking (same technique as used by Erlang's closed source quickcheck eqc and Jepsen.
 I hope to announce part three on integration and contract testing next week.
 Any questions, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xeft is a note searcher like Deft, with less features but much faster, especially for larger note collections. It uses a dynamic module to index your notes and provide search results.
 It has been around for a while now. I initially planned to extend Deft to use the dynamic module as a backend and keep Xeft to myself, but it turns out there are too many Deft features that I can't make to work with the dynamic module backend. I still think this is really cool and want to share it, so I made Xeft publicly available on ELPA.
 In particular, I think it'll work pretty well with Denote.
 I hope someone will find the dynamic module useful and come up with cool use cases for it beyond Xeft.
 Xeft: https://git.sr.ht/~casouri/xeft
 Dynamic module: https://git.sr.ht/~casouri/xapian-lite
 ​
 A demo
 Q: Why not org-roam/rg/etc?
 A: Because they don't fit my bill. If you use Deft but it lags, try Xeft, otherwise stick with what works for you.

It describes a fairly common problem of trying to get a value gracefully from a monadic action that is restricted to MonadFail
 It introduces a new FailT library that provides a good solution to the above problem
  
Please let me know of other libraries that improve usability of MonadFail type class. Also I'd be very happy to get some feedback on the FailT implementation and design choices.

 haskell instance Functor (Flip x) where fmap g s = case s of Flip (Left a) -> Flip (Left (g a)) Flip (Right x) -> Flip (Right x) 
 This is from A Type of Programming, and I know that this is only a stepping stone to introducing bimap and Bifunctor to achieve the same thing, but just can't wrap my head around it.
 I know that Flip has kind *->*->*, just as Either, but I also don't get how the flipping actually happens. Also, how do we even get that kind signature from this definition?
 haskell data Flip b a = Flip (Either a b) 
 I get that the type variables are flipped so should I simply imagine that (Right 7) :: (Either a Int) can be perceived as
  (something not chosen |) Right 7 
 and Flip (Right 7) :: (Flip Int a) as
  Right 7 (| something not chosen)  ?
 Probably overthinking this whole lot...

 I have learned to create svg programmatically in emacs and when you do that you get some sort of data-structure that represents the xml that a svg is made of and one can feed that into svg-tag-mode, fine.
 But what I cannot figure out is how to read an existing svg-file into an elisp-variable: I mean not as the raw xml-content but the parsed data-structure that is used to represent it.
 Is that possible? Does anybody know how? 
 I can't find any docs or examples...
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am trying to get svg-tag-mode to use a previously created svg and can neither make sense of the documentation nor find example code anywhere...
 The documentation says:
 You need first to set svg-tag-tags that is a list of item here each item has the form (KEYWORD (TAG COMMAND HELP)) where: .... TAG is either a SVG image that will be displayed using the 'display property or a function that accepts a unique string argument (match-string 1) and returns an SVG image. 
 The second part about the function in TAG is clear and that is what all of the examples use.
 But what does " a SVG image that will be displayed using the 'display property" mean?
 Assuming mysvg is a variable holding an svg I would have guessed that it should be one of this variants but none work:
 (setq svg-tag-tags '( ("PATTERN1" . ((lambda (tag) (mysvg)))) ("PATTERN2" . ('display mysvg)) ("PATTERN3" . mysvg) ) ) 
 Here is the code for mysvg:
  (setq mysvg (svg-create 80 80 :stroke-width 5)) (svg-circle mysvg 40 40 25 :stroke-color "red") 
 So how is that supposed to work - does anybody understand this?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a good emacs citizen I've been delving deeper and deeper into integrating emacs to my tasks. Fiddling with some basic elisp (not a programmer) I could facilitate a lot of repetitive stuff I got to do in my masters and in my professional work. It's beautiful.
 Now, there's another thing I would like to do. As a masters student, it's important to always check a lot of websites from the government and research institutions to look for opportunities. There might be some useful notice about a financial support, or a important upcoming event etc. Looking for these, I have to manually check at least a couple dozen websites weekly, and I'm getting tired of doing all this work manually. It usually goes like this: copy a link from a list, paste into the browser, leading to a news page from some research institution, check if there's a new entry, go to the next link...
 Does anyone have a cool idea of how this could be done more easily? I thought about RSS feeds, but a lot of the websites don't have them. Also thought about doing some scripting with EWW, in a way that it goes jumping around a given list of websites so that at least I can speed up all the checking. It would also be really cool if there's a way to check if a given link has changed overtime, maybe by downloading the html's to a temp directory and comparing the files?
 Either way, it's something that would be really useful for years and years to come. Does anyone have a suggestion?

 I primarily use a laptop at work (my personal laptop) and run org mode with my notes, todos, and schedule here.
 ​
 Given the travel I might be facing, I'm looking at getting a tablet. I've only really got a few requirements in mind as a whole. Mostly I want to be able to consume movies, books, reading, etc. But mostly I'll be working with it as well. 
 I'm hesitant to go back to an i-pad for one primary reason. Mostly I'm more secure conscious these days and I prefer plain text where ever possible and self hosted everywhere else.

 Android isn't much better on the security front, but I'm heavily considering it. I do currently use an iPhone, though…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 many modes (let's take rainbow-mode as an example) can be toggeled by calling the function that turned it on again. So in M-x I can toggle rainbow by calling (rainbow-mode) again and again.
 Now let's say I want to do that via a keybinding.
 I have this function in my config:
 (defun mh/toggle () (interactive) (message "here") (rainbow-mode) ) 
 And have bound this function to a key. When I press the key I can see the message written - so it gets called, however the rainbow-mode is not toggeled. 
 I have also tried to run (rainbow-mode nil) to turn it off from the function but that does not work either. I have also tried some construction with "with-current-buffer", all to no avail...
 So why is that? What is the proper way to do such manipulations from a function?
 Please note that this is not about rainbow-mode as such (I just use it as an example) but it's about functions in elisp.
 Many thanks!

The parallelism is greatly improved and more general, there are several stability improvements, and it is faster than ever. Kind, the dependently typed programming language, keeps evolving. Kindelia, which was a currency-less p2p computer based on HVM that I never officially announced, has been paused to let me focus on HVM and Kind, but will be resumed in the future.
 I'm so positive and enthusiastic about the future of HVM that I believe it must have a much bigger team to thrive. With that in mind, I'm launching a tech startup - the Higher Order Company - which will focus entirely on pushing HVM to the next level, building valuable products around it, and paving the way …]]></summary>

 Other videos and books I've been reading discuss FP fundamentals which are distinctly different than OOP practices and it would be helpful to see how "effects free" and "invariable data" would best be incorporated into that list of Best Practices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce the release of Kele 0.2.0. Changelog is viewable here.
 This release's marquee feature is kele-get, Kele's answer to kubectl get. With kele-get you can interactively specify the kind and name of the resource that you'd like to get and display its manifest in a separate buffer. What's more, it supports custom resources right out the gate -- a long-standing functionality gap in kubernetes-el (for which I'm a co-maintainer so pardon the candor).
 GIF time!
 See How-Tos > Usage > Working with Resources in the Kele documentation for more details. It's very much an MVP so there are some rough edges. Please open an issue for any peculiar behavior that you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you wanna chat or throw ideas around.

 I have one of the following stanzas in my config:
 (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook org-mode) (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode)) (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode . rainbow-mode)) 
 As far as I understand the documentation they should all be equivalent and should turn rainbow-mode on in org. 
 But they don't. None of these versions work at the moment. No error, just no rainbow-mode (I can turn it on manually without problem).
 But here is my problem: They did work yesterday. 
 I have not changed anything about rainbow-mode but I must have changed something else that seems to have a side effect.
 This is driving me crazy now, I don't care about rainbow mode at all - all I want is to understand what is going on here...
 I am new to emacs and have no clue on how to attack this - does anyone have an idea?
 My config is an org-file that gets tangled when it's written but this mechanism seems to work ok, the generated el-file is in sync with the org...
 I would be grateful for every tip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to understand WAI and warp web server. I am going through this video by Michael Snoyman where he explains the problem.
 Initially, he presents the core data types here in the video. The Application type should be:
 type Application = Request -> IO Response 
 This feels intuitive but it is not especially when it streaming of the data using lazy bytes as explained here in the same video. And, then it concludes that the Application type is actually of:
 type Application = Request -> (Response -> IO ResponseReceived) -> IO ResponseReceived 
 What I don't understand is how lazy Bytestring works! Where the the back-pressure is in the lazy part? And, why does the file handle gets closed before sending the response? The sample code from the video is:
 type SimpleApp = Request -> IO Response simpleRun :: Int -> SimpleApp -> IO () main = simpleRun 8000 $ \request -> withBinaryFile "big-file.csv" ReadMode $ \h -> do lbs <- BL.hGetContents h pure $ responseLBS status200 [("Content-Type", "text/csv; charset=utf-8")] lbs 
 So, isn't the Bytestream being fed at lbs <- BL.hGetContents h line and then used at the very last line? The function withBinaryFile is being called in the callback function and that would wait till the response is sent at pure $ ... line, won't it?
 Any conceptual model I can imagine to better understand and visualize this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Right now, the buffer for org-roam-node-find lists only the title and tags. I'm trying to add the create date of the node to this list as well. After reading high and low, this is as close as I've gotten:
 (cl-defmethod org-roam-node-date ((node org-roam-node)) (org-roam-node-file-mtime node))
 (setq org-roam-node-display-template "${title:*} ${date} ${tags}")
 When I do this I get "wrong type argument: sequencep, xxxxx" when trying to find or insert a node.
 Any ideas on how I can make this work?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been learning org mode and this year is the ear I want to fully dump my notion based system and migrate into org-mode. Most things I have figured out how to solve but I wanted to get a temperature check on how best to save myself duplicate data entry as I manage my daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly reviews. 
 The Goal
 Each day I will use org-roam daily capture template to generate a form with two main sections: 
  
Morning Stack
 Evening Stack
  
These will be largely data capture and routine outlines for myself. I'll likely utilize a 'metric' capture with gnuplot for things like my weight, sleep rating, mood etc. Direct links to my repeated routines i.e. mindset, gratitude type stuff. 
 In Notion I currently will use the relational database system to have each thing nested and rolled into each other so for example my weekly review has each of the 7 days of that week linked into it and I use a database roll up to grab the data entries for easy review that week. 
 In this at the end of each week I have a baseline of information of what happened that week ready to review, it also has some of its own higher level routines & processes built in there too. 
 I've considered using org-refile copy but its a little bit more of a manual process. I'm thinking some of that might be able to be automated either through some elisp or macros. However, before I go through doing all of that I figured I'd ask here for any insight since many of you are much more familiar with org and its tricks than I am.
 Ultimately I want to roll from daily into annual. (Daily -> Weekly -> Monthly -> Quarterly -> Annually)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been reading through this article https://emacs.cafe/emacs/orgmode/gtd/2017/06/30/orgmode-gtd.html. It's not lost on me that it's a bit old but I've failed to figure out any solution to a question I had.
 ​
 I had to make an adjustment to the capture template as it was creating each new TODO in as a sub-level of tasks.
 (setq org-capture-templates '(("t" "Todo [inbox]" entry (file "~/org/gtd/inbox.org") "* TODO %i%?") ("T" "Tickler" entry (file+headline "~/org/gtd/tickler.org" "Tickler") "* %i%? \n %U"))) 
 Now I've working through refile and I've noticed that refile only allows me to move the current item to a sub-item in the existing defined file. This makes sense in some cases, however, I think it'd be more useful to be able to create new top level headings in the gtd.org file. Say a new project emerges is one case....
 ​
 I have tried change the max level setting, to no avail as well as setting 
 org-outline-path-complete-in-steps 
 which did appear to work at first, but this was unsuccessful as well. 
 ​
 So I'm curious, am I thinking about this the wrong way (as a general practice in org-mode... ) or have a messed up some settings here.
 ​
 I'll add that I'm completely open to advice in org mode and even my GTD process (I'm new to both.... although I read the book years ago)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I'm editing some non program files such as documentation for instance, there are times when I need completion for function names or variables of one language or the other.
 For example I many need completion for some functions and variables from some C or Lisp project I am editing, and I need to trigger it momentarily or temporarily for names from the project then turn it off after I get the names I want.
 It would be a good to have a some file-local variables that hold a list of project directories and file types that would provide the completion canditates then toggle them on and of when needed.
 One of my configurations had a completion that showed a list of groups that the completion at point could be based on, but it hasn't been coming up of late.

 (use-package svg-tag-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode svg-tag-mode)) 
 And this DOES work.
 So what is the f... difference?
 Many thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the info, "The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is disabled." 
 I would like my hook to behave in one way when the mode is enabled, and differently when it's disabled. What is the best approach for that? Is there any way to make the hook aware of its context?
 ​
 Some more info about my use-case: this is for my work-in-progress package sticky-shell, whose main purpose is to define a minor mode in a shell buffer, displaying a header with the latest prompt. This makes it easier to keep track of which command was run, even in cases where the command has many lines of output. I've noticed that, some times, the command can be quite long and not fit within a single header-line. For these cases, I've come up with `sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode', which is an additional mode shortening the header.
 I would like this additional mode to be "tied" to the sticky-shell-mode, so that when sticky-shell-mode is disabled, sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode is also automatically disabled. 
 I'd also like users to be able to turn on/off shorten-header-mode whenever they want, and choose whether to run a sticky-shell-mode hook to automatically enable the shorten-header-mode every time they enable sticky-shell-mode.
 In my mind, all of these features would be accomplished by keeping the two as separate modes, and constructing a hook for sticky-shell-mode that will be context-aware, so that when sticky-shell-mode is enabled the hook automatically enables shorten-header (if the user opts in to this feature), and when sticky-shell-mode is disabled, the hook automatically disables shorten-header.
 ​
 Does anybody have suggestions for this? Should I try a different approach instead?

 For the past I_do_not_know_how_many years, I have constantly been switching between Vim/NeoVim and Emacs. Recently, NeoVim was my editor of choice due to the blazing fast development pace. In a very short time, we gained a very powerful scripting language, tree-sitter support, LSP, etc.
 From the user's point of view, Emacs seemed stalled. Since I did not participate in the development, Emacs was just a colossal inertia going on in a uniform movement for me.
 However, things did change A LOT in the last few years. Emacs 29 is just amazing! We have tree-sitter support, LSP support, native compilation, etc. The community packages are fantastic (as always) and very well-integrated. The experience could not be better.
 I would like to thank all the devs for their amazing work.
 I also need to mention Doom emacs, which helped me with a fantastic set of sane default configurations.

 Does anyone have any idea why the authors just didn't implement something like:
 data Tuple4 a b c d = Tuple4 a b c d 
 This obviously removes the nesting. But it seems like since Data.Tuple.Nested is its own library there must have been a reason...
 Is this nesting better for some reason?

 The entire scenario boiled down to to planning the first turn correctly. I shudder to imagine doing so without Org-mode to reduce complexity.
  
First I iterated the list of operations by studying the map.
 Then I grasped the strategic plan of 4 main heroes each clearing a surface quadrant.
 Then I iterated the tactical logistics of turn 1 to transform a haphazard landing zone into a well-supported blitz.
  
The outline simplified the process of deduction in #1-2, allowing me to focus on execution with a clearly-defined goal in #3.
 This YouTube Org-mode demo video shows how I used a single outline to
  
study the map
 iterate operations and tactics
 publish my results
 follow up.

 Longer explanation: In my setup, I assign the TODO status while doing weekly review to tasks I intend to do this week. Thus, I do not want to add a TODO status to inbox items, since I would have to remove it in most occasions before I refile the task. Problem is: I also would like for inbox items to be shown in agenda, since I have to act (refile) on them. But agenda is for tasks only, as far as I understand. 
 Of course, I could assign some tag like ::INBOX:: to inbox items, but it makes no difference, since I would have to remove it later too, or write a custom refile function which removes it. 
 Is it possible to force agenda to display all not-scheduled, not-task items from a particular org-documents only?

Now every time I try to create a new entry in the journal, all carryover tasks are getting added.
 I also tried configuring  (setq org-journal-carryover-items "-carried")  but after adding this one, org-journal started to tag my non-todo items with that and include the non-todo items as carryover tasks which I don't want. This solved the issue of adding carryover tasks though.
 I just want only todo tasks to be carried over the next day once when I create new journal entry.
 If possible I want to mark the task as DONE for older entries also one I mark the carried over tasks as DONE in my current journal entry (:P)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I have been using Emacs for a while now, and had set it up very well to suit my old Ubuntu system (used Emacs 27.1). Now having switched to Mac, I am facing several issues. I am unsure whether it is due to the usage of the 28.2 Emacs version or the Mac that is causing these issues. I have listed them all below. Please provide any help you can for any of the issues.
  
When I do C-x 5 f , the new frame which is opened has the default settings of font and not what is on my ~/.emacs . However the theme (cobalt-blue) is as defined on my init file. The piece of code I use for font is (set-frame-font "Monospace Bold") . Is this sufficient to keep the font same across all buffers and frames I open on my Emacs? If not, how do I fix this issue? If you think there is something else that is overriding this command and leading to my problem, please let me know. I will provide more details from my init file.
 To open Emacs from terminal I followed the steps provided here. However, I am unable to open a specific Emacs file from my terminal. Whenever I try to do emacs file.py it opens the only the emacs GUI front page without loading the contents of file.py. It says on the terminal -bash: .emacs: Permission denied. How do I fix this issue and open the file.py on Emacs?
 The keyboard for Mac is different from the one I used for my Ubuntu system. The Command key plays the role of the Control key here, but has many more features. I added the line (setq mac-command-modifier 'control) to map my Command key to Emacs control key. However, this messes up everything because the fundamental operations using Command key (such as closing files using Command-q ) is not working. So is there a good key mapping (For Control and Meta keys) for Emacs for MacOS that someone can suggest?

 How can I prevent this and why is it happening? 
 I usually install the latest org package, but this happens even when I use thr org package bundled with emacs (that I built just today):

 ​
 For those not familiar with the auto close tag / auto rename tag extension, it works like this:
 ​
 I type <b>

 I get <b></b> immediately, as soon as I type the trailing >.
 ​
 And if i edit the first <b> to be let's say <a>, then immediately the second </b> becomes a </a>.

 There are still many things that are better in org-mode, but unless we can give people a way to use it without telling them that they need to use emacs as well, we'll be fighting an uphill battle.
 I was thinking of something recently and wanted to pick the communities brains a bit:
 Is there something like a "command-line emacs translator" that can take an org-mode file, execute it and retrurn the HTML or PDF, or ...
 A bit like Quarto, but for org-mode. Does such a thing exist?
 Or is there an emacs version, that's fully set-up, so the user doesn't need to know anything about it to use it?
 I don't mean Doom Emacs. That's what my config is built on, but that's still too complex for most people.

 I really, really like many things I can do in orgmode, e. g. assigning many different todo states, filtering items for printing with the noexport tag, using refile for quick archiving etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the first release that was executed via the new GitHub CI. Everything went smoothly, except for an unexpected packaging bug on windows due to text-2.0 linking against libstdc++ by default.
 If you're affected by this and have a defunct binary, simply run the installer again.
 We're also delighted to announce integration with errors.haskell.org, which already has a couple of GHCup codes documented, e.g. https://errors.haskell.org/messages/GHCup-00010/
 How to update/install
 Follow the instructions here: GHCup 
 Or run ghcup upgrade for existing installations.
 ChangeLog
  
restore proper support for FreeBSD and Linux armv7
 integrate with errors.haskell.org, wrt #434
 allow to overwrite distro detection via config wrt #421 
 this is particularly useful for e.g. Ubuntu derivates, where ghcup doesn't pick the optimal bindist, also see the GHCup documentation on overriding distro detection
 
 Add proper support for mirrors wrt #357
 fix a (harmless) bug in ghcup nuke on windows
 improvements to ghcup add-release-channel wrt #708
 fix building newer GHC from source wrt #433
 Fix ghcup install hls -u on windows
 Fix failure with --isolate=dir --force
 Add --metadata-fetching-mode arg, fixes #440
 Add content-length property to downloads
 Fix a grave bug on armv7 during installation wrt #415
 improve many warning/error messages (contributions by @taylorfausak)
 some minor optimization in ghcup whereis ghcup
 improve --keep=always to not clean up directories in certain circumstances
  
Not there yet
  
TUI on windows has a prototype, but it has performance issues that makes it of questionable usability... needs more investigation
 compiling HLS from within the TUI? This needs more discussion

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for ways to split my configuration into multiple files that would work with byte and native compilation. For the past year, I have been using init-loader to load my el files. However, native compilation has always produced many errors like "Assignment/reference to free variable" or "function not know to be defined". I assume that's because each file is compiled separately and some files might depend on packages that are loaded in other files (in other words, I load them in order, but they are compiled separately).
 These warnings haven't bothered for the most part, but every once in a while I run into issues because a "function" is actually a macro and it needs to be expanded correctly for native compilation to produce the right results.
 What is the correct way to split configuration into multiple files while making sure that byte and native compilation works?

 The tree is represented as a list of pairs that represent the edges of the tree: for example
 [(1,2),(1,3)] will be the following tree:

 Is there a simple way to calculate the diameter of a tree in O(n)?

 newbie here.
 There are cases (eg. in svg-tag-tags) where you cannot specify (say) a background color, but instead you specify a face to use.
 Now my question is: What face do you use in such cases?
 What I currently do is use a face that is already defined but not used in my document (usually I use org-level-8) that I tweak with custom-set-faces.
 However I feel that this a bit of a hack and it would make more sense to define my own face (that however I don't yet know how to do).
 So should this be the way to do it: How would I define a new face that is based on an already existing face and only adjusts some attributes?
 I hope that was understandable....
 Many thanks!

 Recently I've been trying to understand how Erlang's bit syntax works, and in the process wrote a library which does something similar:
 https://github.com/stevana/bits-and-bobs#readme
 The readme is written a bit like a blog post, providing motivation, showing how to use the library and explaining how it's implemented. I'm especially interested in how we can go beyond what Erlang does when it comes working with binary data, I mention some ideas in the last part of "contributing" section.
 I hope you find it interesting, and please let me know if you got any feedback, questions or comments!

 While I found this response to the fact that new files are not added to org-agenda-files I was a bit surprised a save hook of some sort could not be used to do this automagically and without having to resort to inotify or manual triggering of a function or evaluation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading through https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/04/async-exception-handling-haskell/ where the author claims it is never safe to recover from asynchronous exceptions. The safe-exceptions package also claims it.
 Now, I'm not sure what recovering means here, but if it really means catching an exception, doing something and not re-throwing it all the way until the program exits, it sounds extreme. One practical example is as follows: a chat application attempts to send a message to another user, but delivery times out asynchronously, i.e. a caller-imposed timeout. Or perhaps the user cancels the action by pressing a button. Whatever was trying to send the message should do its own cleanup and rethrow, via bracket. However, at some point the application is going to have to present an error gracefully to the user and ignore the exception, not just clean up and crash. Or maybe it wants to reattempt delivery at a later point.
 So, what does it really mean that recovering from async exceptions isn't safe? In the previous example, it's true that one might not trivially know whether the action completed, failed or did something inbetween, but recovery is still theoretically possible, e.g.: explicit state syncing or reporting back what step failed (did we receive an acknowledgement from the server or did we cancel before?). Perhaps it means that recovery cannot always happen locally and you might often need to propagate exceptions upwards. But taken to the extreme, it seems to imply that async exceptions must always result in a crash, albeit a safe one.

 I'm re-working some MS Azure Labs in powershell and bash to improve my understanding.
 Doing this in org-mode, be gentle, I've been using org for a while but babel not so much. I'm thinking of blogging my solutions.
 When I run some of the commands they echo things that I don't want the world to see. I want the text of the output but with some of the fields obfuscated.
 This needs to be as automated as possible and repeatable.
 example:
 When I log in to Azure I see something like the following. I'd like to edit the email address and the last part of the Tenant ID as I have done here 
  Account SubscriptionName TenantId Environment ------- ---------------- -------- ----------- email@outlook.com Azure subscription 1 29aa18ee-fdf4-49f7-b5f2-xxxxxxxxxxxx AzureCloud 
 I have a notion of running an emacs lisp code block over the output but have not come up with a way to achieve that. 
 Thanks
 Steven.

 The main impetus for this was having lots of icloud files, trying to open them from within Emacs, and Emacs opening the local ".icloud" file, causing me to have to open Finder and download the file from there.
 So I wrote up a quick package to help with these cases: automatically download an iCloud file when trying to open it, plus some additional utilities, like downloading a list of files or any file matching a regexp within a given directory. As far as I know these aren't easily achievable from Finder or the command line, so it's nice to have an Emacs interface for them.
 Sharing here in case people are interested: it needs some more work (see some of the TODOs in the code for example), but I could turn this into a proper package. Any feedback on the code is welcome.
 I'm also wondering if people can think of different ways to achieve this: Emacs has been around for a long time so I'm sure it has some functionalities to deal with remote files already. Maybe it'd be possible to use those built-ins for this purpose as well?

I'll share some behind the scenes with you. The notes on forgetting started as one note then I saw that they were about different aspects of forgetting. I had critiqued @ctietze's note and suggested explosion, so I eat my own dog food, as we say colloquially.
This morning a note in my review cycle stimulated the creation of a hub to bring the ideas about 'Prompts'  together in a bumper car fashion. Ideas around creating prompts and their use have cropped up in recent readings, and the note that kicked me in the butt was dated December 19, 2020. It seemed like I couldn't not make a hub. The 'Prompts' hub currently organizes 17 notes on the topic.
What I'm Working On
12 New Zettel in the Last 7 Days.
Titles and one-sentence summary/meaning of atomic zettel. These are the ideas I'm currently wrestling with. They represent a 7-day window of new notes.

 As it turns out, FP is apparently very popular with JSers, given that JS is a semi-functional language due to its inheritance from Scheme. There have actually been JSers who've said:

 https://www.zerotohero.dev/learn-haskell/
 ​
 Around some community Discord servers, I meet quite a few JS devs, and I think a few prominent Haskellers actually came in from JS.
 ​
 The problem is, well, the typical Haskell problem. People come in, learn some degree of Haskell, use pure Functional Programming to improve their baseline programming skills, then go back to whatever language they use, often taking concepts back to them in order to improve the language.

 In the JS case, though, is there any way …]]></summary>

 I have hard time actually understanding the internal documentation of emacs - a similar feeling I had with linux when I started. That made me realise how the most valuable resources for learning linux were community created guides and users explaining how they do things: and especially how they refer to documentation.
 Where can I find similar resources for emacs? I mainly am interested in personalising orgmode, like creating templates and macro commands. But also more fundamental things such as where to store work-files, and how to separate personal use of orgmode.

 flatten :: (??? t1, ??? t2) => t1 (t2 a) -> t1 a flatMap :: (??? t1, ??? t2) => (a -> t2 b) -> t1 a -> t1 b 
 where flatten is a generalized version of concat and catMaybes, and flatMap is a generalized version of concatMap and mapMaybe.
 And more generally, input lists can usually be replaced by Foldable, but how do you get rid of output lists? I know Traversable lets you repackage stuff back, but it’s the wrong way around for this case.
 Solved:
 flatten :: (Alternative m, Monad m, Foldable t) => m (t a) -> m a flatten = (>>= foldr append empty) where append = (<|>) . pure (.:) :: (c -> d) -> (a -> b -> c) -> a -> b -> d unary .: binary = (.) unary . binary infixr 8 .: flatMap :: (Alternative m, Monad m, Foldable t) => (a -> t b) -> m a -> m b flatMap = flatten .: fmap 
 Upd: Alternative versions if you just want an iterator instead of repackaging:
 flatMap :: (Foldable t1, Foldable t2) => (a -> t2 b) -> t1 a -> [b] flatMap f = concatMap $ toList . f flatten :: (Foldable t1, Foldable t2) => t1 (t2 b) -> [b] flatten = flatMap id

 Given an array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return the maximum between the number of positive integers and of negative integers (0 is considered neither negative or positive). 
 The video presents a haskell solution iterates over the list twice:
 maximumCount xs = on max length pos neg where pos = filter (>0) xs neg = filter (<0) xs 
 and a commenter presents an optimisation using span and dropWhile. 
 Out of the presented solutions, only C++ used std::equal_range, which performs binary search to find the solution. In wondering if there was an elegant haskell alternative I found the linked article.
 Are there any other idiomatic ways to efficiently approach this problem in Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning,
 I have been struggling with company for awhile and have read the docs on company and still haven't come up with the solution to the problem I've got. I've searched for solutions to this, but not unexpectedly, searching for emacs company doesn't really get to frequency discussions of the company.el module because company is such a common business word. Anyway, I am open to other suggested completion methods or frameworks, I'm not married to it. First I'll describe the problem:
 I'll be writing code and it'll try to suggest completion. I don't have a good screenshot of this, but sometimes I want to complete something like: my_long_signal_name. I start typing and the suggestions and the completion company provides is my_loNG_SIGNAL_NAME. It doesn't appear to correctly maintain the case of the original it's retrieving the suggestion from. 
 I thought this was something to do with the dabbrev module, but honestly I thought I told it how to handle cases in the configuration and this clearly isn't helping.
 (message "---- Company") (use-package company :config (setq company-dabbrev-ignore-case 'keep-prefix) (setq company-dabbrev-downcase nil)) (use-package company-statistics :hook (after-init-hook . global-company-mode) (after-init-hook . company-statistics-mode)) 
 For awhile I just got rid of it. Emacs vhdl-mode has tab-completion that works pretty well, just doesn't provide the dropdown which is nice if there's some confusion as to selection.
 Anyone have a SANE company setup that preserves the case of the suggestion? I have thought maybe I ought to use the etags backend perhaps, and like I said, I've gotten rid of it for awhile, though I do like it's path name suggestions in other non-source code documents so I'd kind of like it back.
 Also open to other completion modules, company just is generally frequently recommended.
 Any ideas on how to properly setup company or another module for this behavior? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are specific solutions for eww and Firefox (see below), but I'd love a fully general solution that just transforms the clipboard content. Ideas on that?
  
For yanking from eww, there's the command org-eww-copy-for-org-mode (part of the module ol-eww), although it only preserves hyperlinks, no italics or anything else.
 
For Firefox there is the addon Org Capture -- but for me it just copies plaintext! I already wrote a quick setup guide, if you want to give it a spin, but it doesn't satisfy me:
 
  
Org Capture web extension
 Step 1. Add these init lines
 (require 'org-protocol) (server-start) 
 Step 2. Make sure you have a member of org-capture-templates that goes something like
 ("p" "Firefox capture" plain (file "/tmp/captures.org") "* %a\n%i%?") 
 Step 3. Run the appropriate one-time command found at https://github.com/sprig/org-capture-extension#register-emacsclient-as-the-org-protocol-handler -- it may look involved but most of it doesn't apply to you, just find the bit that does, and copy paste it into M-x shell.
 Done, now you can capture anything by clicking the toolbar button.

Currently in org-mode when I type this inline it is subscripting to $start_{date}$ which is, well... not great. 
 Is there a way to disable this behaviour (or better yet, enable it when I want it? ... like with markdown where inline math gets rendered as above denoted by single $ bracketed formulae? This is weirdly something markdown seems to get right over org-mode near as I can tell (as well as the ease of having inline code blocks. denoted by backticks in a line.
 Hunting in the docs I could not see a way to granularly control this without turning off prettier_entities completely which would impact a lot of niceties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello people.
 I have a small annoyance when opening Emacs. I currently have a home brewed config that's simple enough for my usage that I don't need to rely on the daemon to speed up opening a frame. It should take less than a second but recently for some reason when I open Emacs on KDE the task bar shows the icon for Emacs that then closes to give place to what I think it's the Emacs Client simply because the title bar shows "Emacs (Client) *scratch\*" but every process monitor shows it's a regular Emacs instance.
 This didn't happen before. I've been using Emacs frequently and after about a month of continuous usage I began experiencing this behaviour. No matter how I start Emacs, from command line, from the apps menu, from a key combo shortcut. Always the same.
 I tried hiding the emacsclient.desktop file from my user's menu with no luck. This happens in KDE regardless of distro. I have an Arch, Manjaro, Garuda and openSUSE TW, all with KDE and all behaving the same. Even when I completely remove my customization files, the regular, old, white Emacs shows the same behaviour. None of these machines have used the daemon/emacsclient in their current installations so I know there's no lingering config from the past.
 Any idea where I can look and/or explain this behaviour.

 I thought to share this with this forum because, on the slide where he compares runtime performance, Scala is the worst. Now, I had no expectations given the need for a JVM to start that Scala was going to be anywhere near the most performant languages, but I am kinda shocked it's literally in last place.
 The author does give caveats that these performance numbers come from the LeetCode editor and even suggests the entire section could be ignored. But I still thought this would be an interesting topic to discuss.

That issue can only be addressed with great effort. For this reason, many contributions are necessary to tackle the problem from several angles.
In this post I’d like to summarise what Tweag is doing in this space. In particular, there are three projects we are working on to help make Haskell adoption and usage a little bit simpler and more straightforward:
the Haskell at Work training course, offered through SkillsMatter;

That is an Emacs feature or package that allows me to hide all the code outside of the function I am currently working on while keeping that function visible. This is not the traditional code folding method, which allows toggling visibility of multiple functions or classes at once.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I used to be a Scala dev, and I came back to my home country, Korea because of COVID situation.
 Now I'm thinking of working in abroad again, because I'm about 40, and it's 'RELATIVELY' old to find a DEV job in Korea. Surprisingly, age is a huge deal breaker when finding jobs, especially DEV jobs in Korea. And it's hard to find Scala jobs in my home country because only few people are using it, and I prefer to work in English environment.
 I would say my skill is in somewhere between beginner and mid level (hoping it's learning toward to mid). I have limited experience in Cats or IO like that, but I am happy to use it and learn it more. And I can do some front-end dev also.
 Is there any good countries to find Scala jobs more easily? In my view defining 'GOOD' is,
  
places where plenty of find jobs exists
 gives working visa easily
 decent salaries
  
I think 1 and 2 is most important, 3 is somewhat negotiable.
 I know economy is not good recently, but what else I can do, I need money.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not a good Elisp hacker. When I started using ChatGPT more often, I started experimenting with letting it write Elisp code. 
 I am completely blown away what it can do!
 Example Query
  
Write an Emacs Lisp function that will do two successive regular expression search and replace functions. First it should search for this regular expression ^- and replace by ##, next it should search for this regular expression: ^[ \t]+- and replace by -
  
Result
  
Here's an example function that performs the two search and replace operations you described:
  
 (defun my-search-replace () (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward "^- " nil t) (replace-match "## ")) (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]+-" nil t) (replace-match "- ")))) 
  
This function can be called with M-x my-search-replace, you can also assign it to a keybinding, like this (global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") 'my-search-replace)
  
It even EXPLAINS the answer! Wow!
 I'll start hacking more Elisp now that I have a patient teacher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working with a server that requires a password and one-time code to log in over ssh (no key-based login possible), and this does basically work with tramp after adding the OTP-prompt to `password-word-equivalents`.
 However, tramp is having trouble filling in the password automatically even though it does find a corresponding entry in `auth-sources` (I'm using the `pass` backend which works fine). I think the issue is that the server _first_ asks for the one-time code, and _then_ for the password.
 Thanks to the power of the recursive minibuffer, I'm able to call `password-store-otp-token-copy` and `password-store-copy` when tramp asks for one-time code and password, search for the right entry, then paste the code/password back to the prompt.
 Ideally, I would like to "teach" tramp to find the password on its own so I don't need to manually find and paste it every time. Is there a way of telling it which secret to use for which prompt? Alternatively, would it be possible somehow wrap the login process in an elisp function that automates the task?
 I'm asking here since I'm a little bit stuck on where / what to look for in the tramp / auth-source source code; I've read the manual pretty extensively but can't find much on the topic. Luckily it's not a huge issue since the ssh connection is re-used for subsequent logins so I only have to do this once or twice a day, but automating the login process would still be a nice improvement.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to get a Jupyter-like experience in org mode using org mode. I mostly followed the "Replacing Jupyter Notebook with Org Mode" blog post by sqrtminusone and added some additional config to have conda-environment-aware IDE features in Python mode. You can see my current config here: https://github.com/martibosch/snakemacs 
 The issue is that, although python-mode is activated within jupyter-python src blocks, I do not get proper indentation when I use the tab key. This is expected since org-src-tab-acts-natively is set to nil in my config (following the config by sqrtminusone. However, if I set it to t, everytime I use the RET and TAB keys (bound to org-return and org-cycle respectively) within jupyter-python src blocks, I get the switch-to-buffer behavior (e.g., conda environment activation from conda.el), which makes the editing slow and completely unpractical (tons of "Switched to conda environment" messages). 
 How can I get TAB indentation in my jupyter-python blocks without having this switch-to-buffer behavior? Thank you.

 By "VERY good", I mean ALL of the following are satisfied:
  
up to date
 
official or at least de fact standard
 
general syntax is fully described (variables, arrays, strings, class, functions, loops, etc)
 
it takes tens of hours to read through it (In other words, it should be much detailed than a simple "Getting Started" tutorial.)
 
 Currently, I can write more than 10 languages: Rust, Go, Java, C, C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript etc. And for many of them, there is a VERY good resource.
 Rust has the official the Book. TypeScript has the official Handbook. Go has the unofficial Learning Go - O'REILLY, which was released 1.5 years ago but almost up-to-date except for the generics support.
 How about Haskell? haskell.org lists some documentations but I can't tell if they satisfy the conditions above (especially for whether or not they are up-to-date).

 Kele (可乐, kě lè, or kə-ˈlə) (“Kubernetes Enablement Layer for Emacs”) is a Kubernetes cluster management package. It empowers you to perform operations as coarse or fine-grained as you need, fast, and get back to your work. 
 For a peek at what's currently possible, visit the documentation site, in particular the Usage section. For this initial release, it has feature parity with kubectx and kubens and that's about it, but there's lots of room for growth.
 It also comes with “batteries included,” containing several integrations with noteworthy packages, in particular Embark, that you can take advantage of for nimbly interacting with your configs and clusters.
 It's now on MELPA, so feel free to give it a try and leave your thoughts in the discussion board!

 I am new to emacs and just discovered emacsclient.
 What I would now like to have is a shell-alias that would run an emacsclient that automatically starts a server if there isn't one but I just cannot figure it out...
 This is what I have tried:
 emacsclient -c -a "emacs --daemon" emacsclient -c -a "" ALTERNATE_EDITOR="" emacsclient -c -a "" 
 In all these cases the client starts and the server gets started but the client does not connect to the server -it only prints "Waiting for emacs" to the console...
 So is there a way to have a command that simply always works - ie. if there is a server it simply connects, if there is no server it starts one and connects?
 Many thanks!

 I was wondering what is the intuition behind the .compile() method of fs2 streams in scala. One thing I notice from examples that some methods are enabled once .compile() is called, for example one could do .compile().count() to count the number of elements of streams. But what does the compile actually do ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I wanted to show off a project that I'm using to learn Haskell language: a "hello" web browser.
 https://github.com/acerion/hello
 The project is based on Dillo web browser (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillo): it's an existing project with C and C++ code base, being slowly re-written by me in Haskell. The biggest part written in Haskell is responsible for parsing and matching of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) but there are also other bits of code re-written in Haskell. This is just a side project that I do in spare time, so don't expect too much from it :)
 I decided to use an existing project (Dillo) and re-implement parts of it in Haskell because:
  
 I wanted to have a constant feedback on whether my code works or not (a web page either displays correctly or stops being displayed correctly),
 I wanted to see how much more compact Haskell code can be compared to original C and C++ code (so far code stats show no significant improvements in code size, probably due to my lack of knowledge of Haskell),
 I wanted to eventually end up with some "real world" program that has large parts of it in Haskell, and a web browser seemed "real world" enough.
  
​
 The project is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/acerion/hello
 The Haskell code is in this sub-directory: https://github.com/acerion/hello/tree/master/src/Hello
 If you have any feedback or suggestions then I'm happy to hear them (just be aware that it will take a lot of time for me to take them in, this project is just a big experiment ran in spare time).

Some example lines insured are property, marine shipping/cargo, energy, cyber security, and political violence. We successfully raised a £9.5M Series A mid-last year.
 As part of our digitisation effort, we developed our own (non-embedded) DSL (in Haskell, of course) called Brossa, with which we can describe insurance products. This approach allows us to build insurance specifics into our programming language as first-class concepts to model structured data capture, data augmentation/enrichment, appeti…]]></summary>

 Also eshell doesn't work outside emacs, so I cannot carry over my knowledge of eshell when I have to use some other terminal emulator. There should be an elisp interpreter outside of emacs so that I can write some small scripts within it instead of using python.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm trying to transition from imperative languages to functional ones, specifically Haskell, and started doing the challenges in HackerRank at the same time that I learn. It's a little hard when you come from imperative languages 😓.
 Currently, I'm struggling with the challenge Compare the Triplets. I've already spent some hours to have this:
 input = "5 6 7\n3 6 10" [a', b'] = map words $ lines input a = (map read a') :: [Int] b = (map read b') :: [Int] score :: (Num a, Ord a) => a -> a -> (a, a) score x y | x > y = (1, 0) | x < y = (0, 1) | otherwise = (0, 0) scores = zipWith score a b sum' :: Num a => [(a, a)] -> (a, a) sum' [] = (0, 0) sum' (x:xs) = (fst x + fst (sum' xs), snd x + snd (sum' xs)) main :: IO () main = print $ sum' scores 
 It works, but I'm stuck trying to get rid of input and use interactive instead to get the data. So my questions are:
  
May someone help me with the input part?
 I'm sure it can be done better, but I'm not able to figure out how, unless using an imperative approach. May someone point me to a more elegant/haskable way to solve it? (I'm planning to use a fold for the sum, for example).
  
Many thanks in advance.

Once you get used to it, going back to editing other languages feels terrifically slow and constraining. (Aside: I'm really hoping the tree-sitter era brings this kind of power to most languages.)

 I'm happy to announce the first part of a five part tutorial on property-based testing stateful systems in general, and distributed systems in particular:
 https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial#readme
 I think it's a resource that's missing, not just for Haskell but the larger (property-based) testing community. Given that I've tried to strike a balance between being general and abstract in the motivation and how it works sections so that people unfamiliar with Haskell can get something out of it, while being concrete in the (Haskell) code sections.
 I hope to announce part two on concurrent testing next week.
 Any questions, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

 When opening a Python file everything is unfolded.
  
I do evil-close-folds (<kbd>z</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd>) to close all folds.
 Then I do evil-toggle-fold (<kbd>z</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>) to re-open the current fold (e.g. a class ...).
 And then I go in the next line and do M-x hs-hide-level.
  
The result may look like this:
 class Foobar: def folded_method():... def next_folded():... 
 I don't know how to reach that result with less keys presses. This isn't the focus of this question but maybe you have a hint? IMHO there is no vi-like "(un)fold-all-in-this-level" function.
 But I would like to add a vi-like (z plus something) shortcut to hs-hide-level also.
  
I'm not sure which shortcut I should use.
 I don't know how to configure vi-like shortcuts.
  
My config looks like this currently
  (use-package evil :init (setq evil-want-integration t) (setq evil-want-keybinding nil) (setq evil-want-C-i-jump nil) :config (evil-mode 1) ;; Use visual line motions even outside of visual-line-mode buffers (evil-global-set-key 'motion "j" 'evil-next-visual-line) (evil-global-set-key 'motion "k" 'evil-previous-visual-line) ;; Set "normal" vi-mode in specific buffers (evil-set-initial-state 'messages-buffer-mode 'normal) (evil-set-initial-state 'dashboard-mode 'normal) )

Intro: best game meets best editor
 Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is a turn-based strategy game released in 1999 that is still has an active multiplayer scene. It is the #1 turn-based strategy videogame of all time, according to Ranker.
 HoMM3 is a superb game for demonstrating iterative strategy refinement and documentation writing using Emacs Org Mode, because of HoMM3's ergonomic hotkeys and autosaves.
 HoMM3's hotkeys are honed by the multiplayer community, which plays timed turns, as in speed chess. The HD+ Launcher makes daily saves in tournament mode, allowing one to revert to any previous day. This is primitive version control for text, but excellent for a videogame.

 The top comments were about the problems at the PHP site, so please read past them.
 I just looked at the shortdocs examples in Emacs and I see how define-short-documentation-group can be a great help if shortdocs are developed and shared collaboratively.
 All you have to do is to visit the site, browse them, select those you want, download and incorporate them into your system, and add yours if you consider them superior.
 If there is some voting the best groups in each set rise to the top to make it easier.
 Is the FSF going provide some infrastructure for this, or will it have to be Github or Gitlab?

 I use Emacs mostly for LaTeX. I would like Emacs to indicat lines where multiple usepackage commands with the same package in a project are used or at least in the same file; either using \usepackge[...]{...} or \RequirePackage[...]{...}. Does anyone know of there is any package for that?
 Currently, I test files using Python script because I am total noob at ELisp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have any elisp or package recommendations on calculating lead and cycle time for todo items? I'd like to also include estimate vs actual effort. 
 I'd like to be able to review a list of tasks (buffer only or across multiple files) to determine the difference between when they were created, time to completion, and time active (in a certain state). I'd like to leverage :LOGBOOK: properties. 
 My goal is as part of a weekly review see where my time got chewed up, refine my estimates of effort and become more efficent with my planning. Ideally I'll extend this to include tags so I can add another layer like "how long is it taking me to get to items tagged :admin: on average". 
 I'm new to elisp and happy trying to work on it myself but some tips or starting points of the best way to address the problem would be appreciated! 
 Example:
 * DONE An important task CLOSED: [2022-05-22 Sun 20:00] :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:30 :END: :LOGBOOK: - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2022-05-22 Sun 20:00] CLOCK: [2022-05-20 Fri 10:00]--[2022-05-20 Fri 10:15] => 0:15 CLOCK: [2022-05-22 Sun 19:30]--[2022-05-22 Sun 20:00] => 0:30 - State "TODO" from [2022-05-15 Sun 20:00] :END: * Report | Task | Effort | Clocked | Missed | Lead Time | Cycle Time | |-------------------+--------+---------+--------+-----------+------------| | An important task | 0:30 | 0:45 | -00:15 | 7d | 1d |

#podcast #children #memorabilia
Make a podcast with kids: maybe share with the family, but not public.
Then you have memories to look back on later as the kids grow up. Meanwhile, the family has something to listen to once in a while without needing to visit. This could e.g. keep grandparents that don't live nearby in touch with their grandchildren, and a kind of conversation going. (Depends on the age of the child.)
Ideas for topics:
what questions (about life, the world) do you want answered?
what happened last week/month?
what are you playing right now?
just: what's on your mind? -- free form talk
Idea from this story:

  
When my daughter was 8 we made a six episode podcast together just talking about stuff. We didn't keep going, but revisiting the episodes is so nice. A couple of episodes had her 4 year old siblings too and hearing their tiny little voices and enthusiastic stuttering is bringing us joy.
I'm glad we did it, and I am now wishing we had more of these sorts of memories.
https://mastodon.social/@screenbeard@aus.social/109630263269445123
@nighthawk it was just at an age where they had heaps of questions and I could explain stuff to the best of my knowledge. We sat down and wrote down a bunch of questions on cards and then picked a card for each episode.

Describe a zettelkasten.
The zettelkasten system was developed by the German sociologist and philosopher Niklas Luhmann, who used it to store and organize his notes and ideas as he wrote and researched. The name "zettelkasten" comes from the German word "zettel," which means "slip," and "kasten," which means "box."
In a zettelkasten, each note is given a unique identification number and can be linked to other notes through the use of cross-references. This allows for the creation of a web of interconnected ideas that can be easily navigated and explored.
The zettelkasten system has gained popularity in recent years as a tool for organizing and managing knowledge, particularly among writers and researchers. It is seen as a way to facilitate creative thinking and problem-solving by allowing for the easy access and retrieval of ideas and information.]]></summary>

 #+name: clean #+begin_src emacs-lisp :var in="" (flet ((clean (in) (if (listp in) (mapcar #'clean in) (if (stringp in) (replace-regexp-in-string "¦" "|" in) in)))) (clean in)) #+end_src #+name: regexps | first | (a¦b) | | second | (1¦2) | #+begin_src perl :var a=clean(in=regexps)[0,1] :var b=clean(in=regexps)[1,1] $a; $b; #+end_src #+name: : (1|2) 
 I've read flet is deprecated for being dynamic-global and not lexical -- or because cl is deprecated. Obviously, in the end it's just replacing ¦ for |, but how can this be redone for these "modern" lexical times? In general, where can I learn modern lexical, cl-* oriented elisp? Pre- and post-lexical is confusing.

Of course this breaks basically every package, and makes my emacs workflow unusable. I'm very confused how this could've happened though, as I thought this was a core emacs function. Does anyone know what I should do? Wipe and reinstall emacs?

 (scroll-left 10)
 would scroll left by 10 chars, but only if the current text scale is 0. If I zoom in with C-x + / (text-scale-adjust)), then the same command would scroll less than 10 chars.
 I might be terribly wrong, but from this I infer that scroll-left's argument is not the amount of characters. Indeed, the documentation says scroll-left's argument 
  
Value is the total amount of leftward horizontal scrolling in effect after the change.
  
This begs the question: how can I scroll left 10 chars, regardless the current text scale?
 I tried playing with text-scale-mode-amount and text-scale-mode-step, miserably failing.
 Any hint? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm perennially confused about use-package declarations and keywords, but what I want to do is the following:
  
  
Defer a package e.g. citar so that it doesn't load at init time (but the function definitions are known).
 When I do call the package, it loads the other packages as well, i.e. citar also loads citar-org-roam and the associated :config setup.
  
 
 Here is what I have now:
 (use-package citar :ensure t :defer t :custom ... ) (use-package citar-org-roam :ensure t :diminish t :after citar org-roam :no-require :custom (citar-org-roam-subdir nil) :config (citar-org-roam-mode) ...) 
  
 Is the right answer to use :requires citar-org-roam in the first citar macro?
  
  
 
 I am trying to speed up my init time, which was on the order of 20s, and now is around 9s, by deferring/lazy-loading some packages. I use Emacs in daemon/server-client mode anyway, so I don't need superfast init times, but small changes help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi everybody, 
 I am learning Japanese and I am tired of having to switch input-method in the OS (linux and MacOS) and then switch back to be able to run any emacs command. As long as I am typing Japanese the OS method works well, but the moment I want to run a Ctrl- or M- command, the moment I have to swich OS input method.
 So I noticed that toggle-input-method seems allows japanese input while allowing romaji commands without switching.
 If you use emacs for Japanese, what is your recommendation regarding Japanese input? Should I stick with the OS one, or use one of the many Japanese input-methods?
 Basically, I am looking for advice from people who have to deal with Japanese within emacs.
 thank you in advance,

 I took just a couple minutes to scratch an itch I've had for a while now. I find my org agendas growing too large sometimes. I hesitate to remove things from my schedule because I don't want to forget them. But sometimes I just don't want to see it RIGHT NOW.
 Enter dired. I love dired-do-kill-lines to pare down my directory listings as I work on them.
 In the same spirit, I wrote the following (naive) function for getting rid of lines in the org-agenda.
 (defun alec-org-agenda-kill-line () "Kills a line from an org agenda, like `dired-kill-line'. It does so naively, so be careful using this!" (interactive) (read-only-mode -1) (delete-region (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position)) (delete-char 1) (read-only-mode 1)) (define-key org-agenda-keymap (kbd "M-k") #'alec-org-agenda-kill-line) 
 I've used it a bit and love it so far. For now I've just got this function for killing one line at a time. If I decide I want this to stay in my workflow, next comes more things "inspired" (copied) from dired like regexp marking and killing. Feedback welcome!

 Should I just leave it like this and use as a standalone function? Is it more normal to write the whole Bifunctor instance when you need it for a less common monad? Wouldn't I get an orphaned instance error if I tried to define this instance since I cannot add code to ExceptT nor Bifunctor libs?

(when (and (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'html) (string-match ".\+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id local :skip-empty-rows t" string)) (replace-regexp-in-string ".\+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id local :skip-empty-rows t" "" string))) (add-to-list 'org-export-filter-final-output-functions 'org-html-remove-spurious-dynamic-block-code)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a GHC plugin that lets you take things like the following code:
 main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "Which argument would you like to print?" index <- fmap read getLine arg <- fmap (!! index) getArgs putStrLn arg 
 and instead write this code:
 main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "Which argument would you like to print?" putStrLn $ !getArgs !! read !getLine 
 This is heavily inspired by Idris's !-notation, the main difference being that this plugin only allows you to use ! inside of existing do-blocks, whereas Idris will insert a do if it doesn't exist.
 It currently works with ghc 9.4. You can find it here:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have any advice as to how to easily leverage any sort of concurrency in elisp?
 To be more specific, I periodically do a package list refresh and reload and my underyling package tech is straight.el. Even with the git commits for each repo limited to only 3 the process of pulling and applying updates locks up my emacs session for several minutes at a time. ( Let's not talk about the complexity of my .emacs, mkay? ;) ) I'm hoping that I can defun a local function that might wrap that process up in some form of concurrency so I don't have to go make coffee when I'm doing an Emacs package update.
 I've looked at just scheduling the refresh via midnight-mode but I don't really want to make updates that frequently. I've also looked at idle timers but I don't see a way to make the straight.el pulls pre-emptible and once the timer trips you are then along for the ride until the process completes. Lastly, I've looked into aio but I'm not good enough with elisp/maybe not smart enough to understand that API.
 Thoughts? Advice?

 I have been using eglot (built-in LSP client implementation) for a long time now, but recently have started to think about DAP, the debugger protocol. My workflow at work would be to write most if not all my code in Emacs, but when debugging, I would turn to Intellij.
 This is mostly because there is no built-in implementation of the DAP protocol in Emacs. Yes, there's dap-mode, but it's so strongly connected to lsp-mode that there have been multiple instances in time where people have shown interest in having DAP connected to eglot, the efforts have gone nowhere. 
 I'm not interested in starting a war between lsp-mode and eglot users, but as an eglot user myself, I would love to see these two communities work together to have a working and built-in solution. 
 Thank you all!

 I got type M s = ReaderT (PuzzleState s) (ST s), and a function canSolve :: Int -> Int -> Int -> M s Bool. In that function:
 case () of _ | assigned -> if sumDigit == i then canSolve 0 (col + 1) (carry `div` 10) else return False 
 The above works, but this doesn't:
 fmap (sumDigit == i &&) $ canSolve 0 (col + 1) (carry `div` 10) 
 This doesn't work either.
 pure (sumDigit == i &&) <*> canSolve 0 (col + 1) (carry `div` 10) 
 Both the expressions produce wrong recursion result. Why?

 in Scala cats effect, lets say I have a function that takes an integer and returns its double. I want to write a functional program that calls this function and prints to the console the return value. More precisely I have the following simple code:
 def f(x: Int): Int = 2 * x def program: IO[Unit] = { val y = f(2) // 4 IO(println(s"result is $y")) // println has side effects } 
 My goal is make the program as generic as possible like the following:
 def program[F[_]]: F[Unit] = { val y = f(2) F(println(s"result is $y")) } // won't compile, what is F? 
 however of course this will not compile because is generic and we do not now what is F(something). How can specify some behavior on F and what should that be behavior be ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a PostgreSQL only database library that can be easily used by Haskell beginner. It is not for me specifically but few of the college undergraduate students I intend to mentor. They would be building a typical multi-tenancy system, so you can expect typical, `tenant`, `user`, `emails`, `clients`, etc. kind of models/tables. And of course, the application domain entities.
 Avoiding the cost of learning EDSL that many Haskell DB libraries provide, I found out that only postgresql-typed and postgresql-simple allow to write only raw SQL queries easily. As I extensively use pgtyped for production Node.js application, I am thinking about using postgresql-typed. While I could find many resources for postgresql-simple, the same cannot be said try for postgresql-typed.
 I was able to get running with postgresql-typed and execute typical CRUD operations, but I fear that it may not support few of the important PostgreSQL constructs down the line. Also, the database must exist at the time of compilation of the project which is different from pgtyped as it generates TypeScript files at development time which we commit in the repository. I also get the feeling that after a while compilation time could increase exponentially as more queries gets added. I am already counting 50+ queries (Good thing is that the queries are not dynamic).
 So, my questions are:
  
Are my concerns valid about using postgresql-typed? (Slow compilations, need for DB at compile time, etc.)
 Lack of literature/articles around it? (Building own connection pool abstraction, etc.)
 Or any other recommendation? (Sticking to plain SQL and not EDSL)
  
​
 P.S - Kindly redirect me to right forum if this is not a right place. I am just a trespasser in a Haskell community :D

 is is possible for Enter to open the current headline when you are in normal evil mode?
 In normal mode Enter does nothing, so I suppose one could remap it without risk?
 Many thanks!

 im starting out with org-mode and want code-blocks to be syntax-highlighted.
 On my system that works for some languages (e.g. python) but does not work for others (e.g. kotlin).
 What do I need to install and/or configure to get syntax-highlighting for kotlin?
 Many thanks!

 I wonder how you guys think intuitively about fs2 streams with an effect F of the form fs2.Stream[F, Int]. From my understanding, F could be the IO monad of cats effect. But I can't make sense of how IO is related to the stream. 
 Appreciate any hint :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[lsp+dap mode works pretty well on very simple projects, I was able to lunch it and add breakpoints for main code. But I'm not able to configure dap for tests. With VSCode it's only a couple mouse clicks, but when I run dap-debug-edit-template it give me this strange struct
 (dap-register-debug-template "Test function" (list :type "go" :request "launch" :name "Test function" :mode "test" :program nil :args nil :env nil)) 
 I have no idea what all these properties means and where are no documentation or examples about them. I was no able to find articles in medium or youtube videos, like this how to debug go tests in emacs with dap mode. My working project has very strange, legacy structure and dap give me Warning (emacs): Initialize request failed: Failed to launch error message.
 Please share your configuration or at least explain what all these properties means.

I installed ivy-prescient do that my counsel-M-x will list recently used commands as first choices (instead of alphabetical sorting initially), but now, projectile-find-file shows me all files under project root, including build artifacts, which takes a noticeably longer time to build the list before I can start entering my substring of interest.
 I tried to look through projectile options, as well as prescient options, but could not find anything that can help me limit projectile-find-file to just git-ls files. Does anyone have experience with this?

I have been following a course offered by the university of helsinki which uses stack for mostly running standalone programs. I am now undertaking my first project on haskell and wanted to know which package manager I should start with - stack or cabal. Since I am starting out, I want to do it right. I am also interested in being a cardano developer and they mostly use cabal and nix (not sure what nix is) as far as I know therefore, would like to think about that too. Please tell me which is better as a beginner.
 Cheers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've a strange problem. I modified some code with a continuation (where the input parameter is a class), but the code now forces the type within the continuation. And it doesn't work anymore.
 My example reduces to (this is not the real example)
 ​
 oldFunction :: Num n => (n -> Int) -> n -> Int oldFunction f n = f (n + 1) 
 compiles
 newFunction :: Num n => (n -> Int) -> n -> Int newFunction f n = f (floor n + 1 :: Int) 
 Doesn't.
 It wants f to be of type Int -> Int. I am surprised. I though the callee decided on the instance of the typeclass. If a f can take a Num it could take a Int . What am I missing ?
 (here is the full error)
 old.hs:5:22: error: • Couldn't match expected type ‘n’ with actual type ‘Int’ ‘n’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: newFunction :: forall n. Num n => (n -> Int) -> n -> Int at old.hs:4:1-46 • In the first argument of ‘f’, namely ‘(floor n + 1 :: Int)’ In the expression: f (floor n + 1 :: Int) In an equation for ‘newFunction’: newFunction f n = f (floor n + 1 :: Int) • Relevant bindings include n :: n (bound at old.hs:5:15) f :: n -> Int (bound at old.hs:5:13) newFunction :: (n -> Int) -> n -> Int (bound at old.hs:5:1) | 5 | newFunction f n = f (floor n + 1 :: Int) | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Failed, no modules loaded.

        <updated>2023-01-07T09:15:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have released a slightly updated version of labrat, a simple command-line program for printing labels with little cermony and that can be invoked from within Emacs or from a shell.
 You can read about it and how to install it on github here.
 This is from the README:
 
  
Motivation
  
I need to print labels. And in my case, mostly I need file folder labels. I typically want to print to a Dymo LabelWriter, of which I own several variants. The problem is that I work almost entirely in Linux, but the simple task of printing a file folder label has required opening a GUI application, such as the very fine glabels, or worse, switching to a machine running Windows or to a Mac to run Dymo’s proprietary GUI. The Dymo GUI is particularly irksome because it takes a long time to start up and demands that you register every time you open it.
 I wanted a way to print a file label from the command line, or even better, from within my editor, Emacs. After giving up looking for such a thing without success, I decided to write my own. Hence labrat. With it—after due configuration—printing a file folder label is as simple as:
 $ labrat 'First Line of Label-->And the Second Line'
 Or, you can preview the label in your previewer of choice (mine is qpdfview) by adding the -V flag:
 $ labrat -V 'First Line of Label-->And the Second Line'
 Even better, I have included with labrat an elisp file (labrat.el) that will invoke labrat to form a label with the text of the paragraph at or before point. So within Emacs, you can bind keys to the commands, labrat-print and labrat-view to print or view the current or prior paragraph as your default label. Thus, in Emacs, I have C-z C-l C-l bound to labrat-print and C-z C-l C-v to labrat-view, and I can type a label in any buffer and get it generated with very little ceremony.

But I‘m sure, AI will help. It‘s a great area of application. Mem is already trying. More will follow.
Until then I‘ll just patiently record in a simple way whatever I find valuable. The current tool is not important, eg Roam or Obsidian or Mem or Notion. In the end the content can be either used across tools or exported so the AI can process it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to setup a note-making system with Emacs+org-mode. 
 I have already set up a MediaWiki installation for note-making. Here is a view of categories, subcategories and wiki page. It's very easy to navigate to any page I want by traversing the category tree. Organically, the categories and subcategories evolve over time. A wiki page can be under multiple (sub) categories.
 Category Tree in MediaWiki
 But installing MediaWiki means I need webserver+php+mysql stack, which I want to avoid if possible. If I have to backup, replicate, migrate, and update MediaWiki to a new machine it's not going to be easy. On top of this MediaWiki wiki syntax also sucks. Despite all these headaches, I still see this setup as valuable for providing me with category tree navigation and knowledge hierarchy.
 I know there is org-roam but it's not providing me these kind of dynamic category trees and allow a page to have multiple parents. For me these category hierarchies are more important than back links.
 I can use projectile + nested folders but I want the ability to one sub category available under multiple parent category. Creating and managing symlinks may work but it won't scale if I have 300+ wiki pages which should be filed under multiple parent categories.
 MediaWiki also provides a breadcrumb of clickable category links like below:
 Wiki > Subjects > Computer Science > Programming Languages > Clojure
 Is it possible to achieve 
  
similar Category hierarchy, 
 navigable dynamic category tree and
 multi-parent subcategories (i.e a category or page can belong to multiple parent categories)
  
any ideas/pointers to solve this with Emacs?

 Where is the point of intersection usually? At the 6 month mark? 1 year? 2? Certainly it may be subjective depending on what one finds difficult or tedious but aiming for a generalization here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all!
 ​
 Edit: I tried solving this by adding an autoload to `smudge-connect-player-status` which seems to have possibly fixed THIS issue, but there is another problem with Oauth that makes the whole thing hang and I'm not sure.
 I'm using Pop! OS, with Emacs installed from terminal, emacs 27.1.
 I posted a few months ago about getting Vuiet set up. I liked it a lot, but it was very minimalistic. Really only good for mindlessly playing a handful of tracks, and at that, you kinda had to know who you were looking for. It also had a few weaknesses, like constantly throwing up my debugger every time a particular song's lyrics couldn't be found.
 I finally gave in and switched to Spotify from YT Music since my partner uses it, and also I discovered Smudge, which looks awesome!
 ​
 Thing is, it doesn't actually work, because some functions are not defined yet. Something something spacemacs lazy loading. I'm not sure how to fix this but I know Spacemacs has some behavior which causes packages to not be completely loaded if they're not invoked - I think somehow this is what's causing the issue.
 So, I try to run: `global-smudge-remote-mode`
 This is the output:
 `smudge-connect-player-status` not defined.
 Any attempt to run another smudge function then causes emacs to hang indefinitely and it must be killed (That's dangerous!!!)
 I also noticed that when I first launch emacs, I only have access to functions which are defined in `smudge.el`, not ANY of the dozen or so other .el files included with this repository.
 Only smudge.el functions on startup.
 So I'm hoping this is a relatively simple configuration change I need to make in order to load this package properly and prevent the crashes. Thanks everyone!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I think state machines of the type Input -> State -> (State, Output) are great. They are easy to reason about, and if run on a separate thread with access to a queue of Inputs they perform well too.
 Sometimes the state machine might need to do some blocking I/O before producing the output though, this slows down the processing of inputs.
 I've recently implemented and documented an experimental way of how we can write the state machine as if the I/O is blocking, but actually it's non-blocking and inputs can continue to be processes while we wait for the I/O action to complete:

 Any feedback, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In exwm, I often start up one sub-emacs process, using M-& emacs. Most often this is for running my Telega. In every case, the buffer names of this sub-emacs process is "E: <BUFFER-NAME>", where that BUFFER-NAME is changes to whatever buffer is being visited in the sub-emacs at this time.
 Now, my goal is to have a key that will switch-buffer to that sub-emacs process whatever it is running, optionally starting the process if it hasn't begun yet. What is the best way to switch to my "E:.*" buffer?

Window 1 - Emacs
 Window 2 - Kitty Terminal with Tmux
  
In my Emacs frame. It is split into 3. On the left I have 2 panes with code and on the right I have the repl.
 This setup is fixed. As in, it doesnt really change much. 
 I use the terminal heavily for a bunch of coding and non-coding things while I am coding. Having the terminal on a separate window is very quick for me to switch and do something.
 I am curious what other peoples terminal workflow is. How do you integrate the terminal into your workflow? If you use term or v-term, how do you make switching easy and seemless?
 Thanks

 I can't seem to get it to work correctly. The syntax highlighting is all off.
 It does not seem to respect "@php" / "@endphp" and all other blade tags. 
 When I set the web-mode engine to php it only works if I use the "<?php" tags.

 Do you guys run Emacs on Android? And I don't mean just in terminal. I want a full-blown GUI that supports all the things Emacs 29 has - sqlite, etc. Is that possible or I just want too much?

 "Why did the Emacs user switch to Vim? Because they wanted to be able to exit the editor."
 "Why was the Emacs user upset when they lost their cursor? Because they couldn't find their point."
 "Why was the Emacs user excited about the new release of their editor? Because it had a cut and paste feature."
 "Why was the Emacs user upset when their editor crashed? Because they lost all their parenthesis."
 I hope these jokes bring a smile to your friend's face! Just be sure to keep in mind that everyone has different senses of humor, so it's important to be mindful of your friend's feelings and to not overstep any boundaries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This has annoyed me for quite some time now and I've never found any solutions for it online. I'm using lsp-mode for C/C++, and I have some dependencies specified in a CMakeLists.txt.
 The problem: Emacs keeps complaining (I think it's the language-server who is complaining about this?) about c-headers for the dependencies specified in CMakeLists.txt not being found.
 The solution I've been using so far is to manually put the include paths to these dependencies in a compile_flags.txt file. For example:
 ``` -std=gnu99 -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include -I./include
 Deps produced by cmake
 -I./build/_deps/webp-src/src -I./build/_deps/vec3_static-src/include -I./build/_deps/cglm-src/include ```
 However, it's kind of annoying to keep fiddling with these files all the time. Is there anyway to configure lsp-mode or whoever is complaining about missing C-headers to actually look inside the _deps folder created by cmake, without using a compile_flags.txt?
 Like a global system-wide compile_flags.txt ?
 Thanks!

 I don't care if there is a running process there - in fact I probably want it to run to update my email. I assume that's what it is doing.
 /shrug. 
 I mostly ignore it, but from time to time it grabs focus when I'm typing in another buffer and I need to re-focus the other buffer which is very annoying. The only way to make it go away is to quit and re-start emacs entirely, and to not run mu4e anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm new to emacs and I've just started using org-agenda and I have a question for you.
 Let's suppose I've courses every Tuesday and Fridays from 10:00 to 12:00, starting on January 30, 2023, and up to march 18, 2023. I'm trying to enter this so that it shows in my org-agenda. I've done this in the following way:
 * TODO Biology class <2023-01-31 Tue 10:00-12:00 +1w> :PROPERTIES: :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-03-18 Sat 0:00] :END: * TODO Biology class <2023-02-03 Tue 10:00-12:00 +1w> :PROPERTIES: :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-03-18 Sat 0:00] :END: 
 When I activate the agenda view and go to yearly view (via the command org-agenda-year-view) I see the entries every Tuesday and Friday at the right time, but I also see them appear well beyond the LAST_REPEAT date that I fixed inside the PROPERTIES section.
 So my question is: am I understanding wrong the usage of LAST_REPEAT? Is this the expected behavior? What should I do to make those entries not show beyond a given day (i.e., once my courses are over)?
 Besides my particular question, I'm open to any suggestions as to how I could be doing this in a better/more practical way. I'm reading the manual online and this is what I've came up with, but it might be far from optimal.
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

 $ ls /usr/lib/libtiff* /usr/lib/libtiff.so /usr/lib/libtiff.so.6 /usr/lib/libtiff.so.6.0.0 /usr/lib/libtiffxx.so /usr/lib/libtiffxx.so.6 /usr/lib/libtiffxx.so.6.0.0 
 I usually update my OS before I turn off the computer. Started computer today and Emacs refused to start due to lbtiff.so.5 not found.
 Quick
 $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libtiff.so.6.0.0 /usr/lib/libtiff.so.5 
 (or recompile Emacs :)) fixes the problem; if anyone is experiencing the same issue.

This usually puts me in the position of having out-of-sync git repositories, and I have to hard reset the repos that I don't want to push. What I'm wanting is basically to have one continuous emacs session in which I can just jump over to my laptop and continue where I left off. Is this possible? Is it simple to achieve?

 People say 'Learning Scala' by Jason Swartz is good but way too outdated as it is from 2015.
 Others say 'Programming Scala' by Dwan Wampler os too difficult to begginers and uses Scala 3.0, which is not widely used yet.
 And some say 'Scala Cookbook' by Alvin Alexander is good but misses fundamentals as it contains only recipes and assumes you already know the basics.
 Anything I'm missing here? Any recommendations?

 We are looking for anything that you think might be interesting for a wider audience and that is Scala related:
 ✨ Maybe you are using Scala in a novel way? 
 🧑‍💻 Or you wrote an interesting open-source library? 
 🦾 Or you have a use case to share from a project you are working on? 
 ⚙️ Or maybe you just want to show what can be done with the Scala language and existing Scala tools?
 Our main goal is to start some interesting discussions during the breaks and the after party, and inspire people to explore Scala and the Scala ecosystem later at home 💭
 Hence we are aiming at 30-minute presentations. We expect the audience to be familiar with the Scala language and its basic concepts. You don't need to have any previous speaking experience 👶
 In case of any questions or doubts, write us at scalar@scalar-conf.com
 We'll be happy to help ❤️

Dfinity: Their job ads are all Rust now. Anyone know why they abandoned Haskell in favor of Rust?
 Tsuru Capital: No longer Haskell. Here I can ask further about their "code sample" problem. That problem seems like the perfect use-case for Haskell (reading & parsing large files in constant memory using the streaming and parsing libraries), yet they still abandoned Haskell. How can you do the same in Rust? I thought your only option is going back to manual for-loops.
  
Do you have other examples? A growing trend or just 2 anomalies?

 SEND MORE ----- MONEY 
 This equation has a unique solution:
 9567 1085 ----- 10652 
 A non brute force solution is to use backtracking with memoization. My choice is to use the State Monad along with mutable Vectors. What I'm having trouble with writing is the part where a number is assigned to a letter. The steps for doing that are:
  
Find the currently unassigned numbers.
 For each unassigned number, add it to the solution, and recurse.
 If step 2 returns true, return true. Otherwise, remove the number from the solution.
