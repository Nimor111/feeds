 ​
 Likewise, I'm currently running a high-bandwidth Haskell application on http-client, but the program keeps on crashing (without exceptions).
 I think we've been generally aware that Haskell networking has been a bit retrograde for quite some time, but it'd be nice if someone (else, not me) would help step up to get Haskell's networking libs back on track.

 This blog entry doesn't really convince me why I should prefer type families over Fundeps, especially since functional dependencies seem more elegant to me instead of introducing additional types or even another extensions like "type family dependencies".
 Here is a "radical suggestion" that fits this topic well:
 https://typesandkinds.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/what-are-type-families/
 Accordingly, functional dependencies seems less problematic…

 I am, for some reason, writing a screen play, and taught it will be helpful to distinct different elements of scripts by applying different background colour to blocks.

 I think maybe it should be like this, but I don't know what to put instead of "org-src-block-faces".

 I'm using Doom Emacs, and according to this, if I have something tagged :important: And something else tagged :important:chore:
 I should be able to do a tag search like important-chore or +important&-chore to be more explicit. But the negation doesn't seem to work at all when I do the search, it works the opposite. If I do +important&-chore it ONLY shows me things marked :important:chore: 
 I would think that it's completely broken, but it IS searching the org files correctly and finding tags. 
 Match tag search
 Search for important
 Try to negate chore

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My work involves a fair amount of time spent in the terminal, in docker containers, on remote machines via ssh, and sometimes in containers on remote machines. To support this, I’ve developed a customized terminal experience on kitty. Basically, if I open a new tab, it will clone my current environment, including the container/remote, current directory, and current bashrc. And it also color-codes tabs based on the type of environment I’m in. 
 I’m curious if it would be possible/interesting/desirable to recreate this setup in emacs, with the ultimate goal of using emacs as a customized ide + terminal emulator. 
 Does anyone have thoughts on this? The first issue that I see is that so far, I haven’t found a tab bar for emacs that supports customizing the colors of the tabs. I’m sure this is possible, but I’m too new to emacs to know how difficult it would be (I have experience coding in multiple lisp dialects, so needing to code in order to customize is not a drawback). Thanks.
 (EDIT: I guess this is partly a question about customizing emacs and partly a question about using emacs as my primary terminal emulator.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two days ago I wrote a small experiment that lets me include Lisp as a template placeholders. It looks something like this:
 1 + 2 = {{ 3 }} 1 + 2 = {{ (+ 1 2) }} 1 + 2 = {{! escaped }} 
 I used Mustache-like syntax, to basically just delimit Lisp region from the rest of the text. However, due to Lisp paranthesized syntax it is possible to simplify it. I have now re-written it so it just needs one marker to mark which expression is to be evaluated as Lisp:
 1 + 2 = %%3 1 + 2 = %%(+ 1 2) 1 + 2 = %%!escaped 
 Due to Emacs being a text processing toolkit and a Lisp repl/environment, that basically let us use Emacs Lisp as a template language in text files. The intended use is file and code generators.
 The simplified syntax turnes out to be slightly harder to process than the one with start and end delimiters, however I think it might be worth, so here is an experiment to test the idea.
 Download and details about the usage details are in online repo.
 I appreciate critique and discussion, especially if you find a bug or some fundamental problem.

 Blamer.el

 Blamer.el is a minor mode for Emacs that shows the last modification date and the author of the current line or the current region in the overlay from git.
 The package can be slow on very large repositories, so I'm testing asynchronous functionality now and plan to make a release early next year.

 I'm wondering if there's a similar tool available for GHCI. Such a tool would ideally offer an interactive, fuzzy search method for sifting through GHCI history.
 Many thanks in advance for any suggestions! :)

 Do some themes have a way of adjust the cursor colors to match at runtime or there none whatsoever?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I also posted on Posit's community portal but maybe better to ask the Org-mode crowd.
 I'm interested in exporting Org-mode documents to Quarto. For instance, I have the following document called test-export.org
 #+title: Quarto export test #+begin_src python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #+end_src #+begin_src python plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) #+end_src #+begin_src python :eval no print("Hello World!") #+end_src 
 I first try using pandoc to just export to markdown format:
 pandoc test-export.org -t markdown --o test-export.qmd 
 test-export.qmd then looks like
 ``` python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` ``` python plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) ``` ``` {.python eval="no"} print("Hello World!") ``` 
 The problem is that Quarto expects 
 ```{python} 
 to denote Python code blocks. (I can understand that pandoc makdown conversion should not know to convert :eval no to #| eval: false in the code block but that is secondary).
 I could write a post-text-processing script to handle this but I wonder if there is a more direct way to at least get the language specification to be {python} instead of python or {.python ...}. I have also tried exporting to other Markdown flavors using pandoc, and using Org-mode's built-in Markdown exporter. I guess the built-in exporter targets the original Markdown
 # Table of Contents import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) print("Hello World!") 
 so is even further away from the Quarto form.
 AFAIK the Quarto documentation only defines the Quarto -> Org transformation and not the other way around. 
 Thanks for your suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I wrote org-roam-pygraph, a small Python library to extract the natural graph structure associated to a collection of org-roam nodes.
 Recently I took up a project of running some data analysis on my org-roam collection. In the process, I decided to write a more featureful Python library to assist in all the grunt work of extracting information from the org-roam database.
 Features
  
Several "indices" are provided, which are dictionaries with roam-node IDs as keys and some data pertaining to that node as values. Indices provided are 
 Title index (data: title of node)
 Filename index (data: where the node is located)
 Tags index (data: tags the node has)
 Backlink index (data: list of roam-node IDs a node links to)
 Org link index (data: list of org links that are not backlinks to other nodes)
 Node body index (data: the body text of the node)
 Math snippets index (data: list of LaTeX snippets in the body of a node)
 Source block index (data: list of src blocks in body text, tagged by language)
 
 networkx representation of your org-roam collection. You can use networkx to do all kinds of graph analytics on your collection, including visualization, which is how I made the cover image for the git repo.
 Basic manipulations of the collection 
 Filter collection by tags
 Remove orphan nodes
 
  
The code can be found at https://github.com/aatmunbaxi/orgroamtools, and the code is documented at https://aatmunbaxi.github.io/orgroamtools. The package is available on PyPI, and can be installed with pip install orgroamtools.
 PRs and issue reports are welcome.

 If you have a plain list with checkboxes, like

 Is there a way to check all sub items at once, not C-c C-c them all one by one?
 C-c C-c on Things to dojust gives error message
 org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c: Cannot toggle this checkbox: unchecked subitems
 I looked up the manual page for Checkboxes, and one way seems to mark all the items you like to check and C-c C-c, but wondering if there is an easier way for a checkbox subtree?

For some reason any time I <tab> complete imports in typescript files, company-mode (I assume) is appending a $1 to the end of the name. For example, if I were to type import {Rec and then press <tab> to complete I would expect the result to be import { Recipe } from './recipes/recipe.model where Recipe is the name of the class. Instead my tab-completion is imported as import { Recipe$1 } from './recipes/recipe.model'; 
 This additional $1 only occurs when importing packages- not when using tab completions for anything else. Happy to provide any pieces of my init file that would be of use to help me solve this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Emacs speedrun videos, I have a lot of org docs stacked up that needs recording.
 However, especially with subjective choices with lots of valid options, community breadth is more valuable that individual depth.
 What are habits, tools, configuration choices, fundamental and advanced, that you would recommend to a programmer to ramp up quickly, all the way to becoming productive at working on Elisp packages?
 Videos are around 5-10min and count on the viewer to do the work but try to let them know when to go deep and what on.
 I'll go first: * Intrinsic types in Emacs (and how to relate it to understanding the UI) * Apropos and small tricks to use docstring conventions to search for types * Byte compiling * Structural editing of some variety * Evaluate in other buffer, all the evaluation workflows and their tradeoffs * Persistence, be it org mode, saving scratch, writing modules, or ielm history * All the bells & whistles in the helpful package, including using it to quickly find the right manual contents * Fuzzy searches for symbols and important search keys like "-hook$" and "-functions?$" etc * Edebug & debug * LLM prompting to overcome lack of proper vocabulary & language barrier * Shortdocs * The built-in Emacs glossary * Macrostep * Tests * Process, JSON-RPC, HTTP * Probably some CL because I think the built-in loop structures are just anemic, but I want to stick to bread & butter cl-lib. That said, what do you consider bread & butter?
 Even if I don't share your views, I will try to make sure that sources of high value with at least a significant fraction of users are represented. It costs very little extra time to mention something like, "If you are doing X a lot or when you get to Y, people say try adopting Z."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to create a habit where I run three times a week. So I decided to set a org habit that is set to every 56 hours as follows using org-gtd:
 ** Running SCHEDULED: <2023-12-22 Fri 23:00 ++56h> :PROPERTIES: :ID: Running-2023-12-22-22-02-57 :STYLE: habit :END: [2023-12-22 Fri 21:57] 
 In the org manual, it says that I should be able to do this. But when I open the agenda view, I am hit with the error: Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Invalid duration string: ++56h")
 Why is it not possible to do this? Or is there another way to achieve this?

I can get this example to work by omitting the fac :: Int -> Int line but this error in particular is really starting to bug me.
 The following gives a parse error at |fac 0 = 1:
 fac :: Int -> Int |n :: Int |fac 0 = 1 |fac n = n * fac (n-1) main = print (fac 42) 
 This gives a parse error on '::' at n :: Int:
 fac :: Int -> Int n :: Int fac 0 = 1 fac n = n * fac (n-1) main = print (fac 42)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i have been training for a job in the medical field (maybe a bit of an understatement in regards to the cost and mental toil, but saying i'm in med school has its implications because i'm really not.) and about two-and-a-bit months ago, i decided to start a zettelkasten. i learned all about it and wrote notes about the underlying philosophy in the zettelkasten itself, and things started off fantastic! MOCs and hub notes feel like a dream for my personal organization. higher-order learning seemed extremely necessary. disregarding the idea of separate disciplines in lieu of an understanding rooted in existing knowledge seemed very helpful.
now it's been a couple months and my zettelkasten contains over 100 zettels; i'd say about 20 regarding personal knowledge management and then about 80 medical notes. that is the problem, though. i look at other notemakers' obsidian graphs and they're one big ideaverse of notes radiating from the center. my notes, conversely, are separated into blobs by discipline or level of abstraction from reality. (e.g. anatomy [tangible] vs. study concepts [intangible]) in essence, i want to keep watching my zettelkasten grow--it is helping me retain information--but i'm a bit scared that i'm not implementing higher-order learning correctly.
this is making me unsure whether a traditional, luhmann-esque zettelkasten is the best idea for medical study. what do you think? does anyone else have trouble connecting tangible, business-related zettels to more abstract zettels?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, Flyspell highlights every single word, even if it's correct and if it exists in the dictionary. At first, I thought it's an issue with aspell, so I switched to hunspell, but the behavior is the same. I do have hunspell installed on the system, dictionaries too (using Romanian language), running hunspell -D in console shows that the dictionaries are loaded:
 LOADED DICTIONARY: /Users/claudiu/Library/Spelling/ro_RO.aff /Users/claudiu/Library/Spelling/ro_RO.dic 
 This is my spellcheck config bit from init.el:
 (setenv "DICTIONARY" "ro_RO") (setenv "DICPATH" (concat (getenv "HOME") "/Library/Spelling")) (setq ispell-program-name "hunspell") (setq ispell-really-hunspell t) (setq ispell-dictionary "ro_RO") (setq ispell-local-dictionary "ro_RO") (setq ispell-dictionary-alist '(("ro_RO" "[[:alpha:]]" "[^[:alpha:]]" "[']" nil ("-d" "ro_RO") nil utf-8))) 
 Every single word in the image below exists in the dictionary and shouldn't be highlighted. Anyone have any idea why this is happening?

It could well be my set-up, but is there anyone here using tree sitter versions of js modes successfully with react/jsx from emacs 29? If not, what is the current "best thing" - googling js/jsx with emacs opens pandora's box and I'm really pretty confused as to how best to move forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I'm a Haskell novice and have been challenged to make something like a chess engine. I love the idea of doing it in Haskell and also doing it properly™ (i.e. overengineering the hell outta it lol).
 I already have a program (involuntarily written in Java) to store/output the board state and determine whether someone won.\ What I intend to create is the following: 1. a protocol between the Java program and 2. (see below)\ this will contain things like "NEWGAME", "TURN xy", "RESPONSE zw", etc. 2. a Haskell program that implements that protocol to actually generate a good next move and send it back to the Java application, which 3. I will modify to be able to talk to my "engine"
 So what is your folks' opinion on how to structure the Haskell code / protocol?\ I came up with this: - CECP-/UCI-like protocol: one move sent at a time, my program would need to store that somehow\ however, I don't have any idea on how to elegantly do this in Haskell and wonder whether it can even be done idiomatically - get the complete board state as input each time and output the next move / new state; as easy as it gets and seems to fit really well with the functional paradigm BUT extremely inefficient and not what I would do if I was programming it in another language (also apparently not how most protocols work…)
 Dear, epic, most valued, mathematically blessed computer scientists, can you bestow some advice upon me, so I can maybe become worthy of joining your ranks one day?
 Thanks in advance and happy holidays! :)

 I've noticed that when I start the interpreter (using run-python), the interpreter doesn't have any of my variables: os.environ shows a bunch of useful variables but none of the ones I've set in my shell-config file (~/.zshrc).
 I've been digging through the code and it seems that the python interpreter process is ultimately started by make-comint-in-buffer. What is the preferred solution to ensure that this function picks up all the variables I want before starting the process?

 (global-unset-key (kbd "C-w")) (global-set-key (kbd "C-w") 'delete-window) 
 Edit: Looks like evil-mode added a whole bunch of keybindings for working with windows that all start with C-w. I think I'll try actually using those.
 One things I'm still unclear about: Did global-unset fail to remove these because they aren't global? Or did it fail because you'd have to unset each binding that begins with C-w individually? 
 I'm hoping it's not the second one. That's a lot of commands, if you have to unbind each one individually.

Since then single ESC isn't respected in tui (-nw) but works fine in gui. Same for the arrow keys. They're fine in gui but in tui they force me into insert mode (with a flash of M-o being undefined) and type ABCD.
 I get the same behaviour with -Q and then eval (require 'evil), so it's something that's changed upstream and not in my config.
 Anyone else affected and have found a solution?

 I've got the menu-bar and tool-bar hidden. But I can't figure out how to get rid of this gray bar at the very top of emacs:

 I can get rid of it using toggle-fullscreen-mode, but that also hides the system menu. I don't want fullscreen, I just want the bar gone.
 Any way to do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read 'Functional programming simplified' by Alvin Alexander, and I think I understand pure function, side effects, IO monads, type classes pretty well(although I dislike its implementation)
 But I don't understand state monads, functors or monad transformers. I tried "scala with cats" and gave up after a few chapters. So I don't know how to use cats-core
 Now can I jump to learn cats effect or zio ? For now I don't want to learn advanced Haskell-like FP concepts, but focusing on writing pure functions and handling IO in an FP way. Just don't know if cats effect or Zio require understanding of these concepts (I just want to use cats effect or zio, not trying to understand what's behind the scenes)
 And if you think it's ok, which one is simpler in you opinion? Some also say Future is enough, do you recommend I just learn how to use Future as a monad to solve real world problems?

 I don't know what Doing vfork means, all i know is that some file is missing. But how do i find out WHAT file is missing? Non of the buffers (lsp log, lsp stderr etc.) say something meaning full... how do i debug this? --debug-init is useless i think because the error dose not occur during init.

 pointfree.io converted it to:

 Here, xs is [a] and chooseInt is from QuickCheck.
 I can't figure out how the pointfree expression type checks (it does). I understand each of the following functions individually, but combined they're hurting my brain. Can you deconstruct the pointfree expression and explain it to me?
 liftM2 :: Monad m => (a1 -> a2 -> r) -> m a1 -> m a2 -> m r (<$>) :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b (,) :: a -> b -> (a, b) 
 I even get (<$>) (,) (chooseInt . (0 ,) . length), which is a function wrapped in a Functor, but liftM2??

I'd like to introduce you to yet another way to organize a knowledge base in Emacs. This is the howm package by Kazuyuki Hiraoka. Package available on Melpa.
I've been using howm daily for a year and a half now, and I can confidently say that it is a simple and elegant solution for taking notes. Howm, much like "The Archive," utilizes links as a search trigger, among other similarities.
The package is almost 21 years old, but Hiraoka continues to actively support it. I've spent the past year creating a guide for howm, and I'm glad to show you what I've come up with.
The tutorial on howm is free and you can find it in English and Russian here:

 However, I'd like not to renounce (yet?) to the comfort of GUI mail clients (Thunderbird, Evolution, Geany, any is good for me...) in some situations. So the question: is there a way to make them share the same inbox, without having to download the mail twice?. Maybe with a separate process that fetches the emails, so that Gnus does not get stuck doing network operations.
 Additional info: My mail provider is Proton Mail. The question applies mainly to Linux systems. It would be useful to have a similar setup even using Emacs for Android - but I guess it's a chimera.

 This year, my goal has been to make a guide on using the howm package.

 The language barrier hase made it difficult for the howm package to reach a wider audience outside of Japan.

 Sorry to spam you a bit recently. I promise this is the last time, at least until the New Year ;)
 One of the new features in the recent IntelliJ Scala Plugin release is the X-Ray editor mode. It displays hints next to your code without adding too much clutter, and only when you want it. Even though X-Ray was already mentioned in the release note, we - the IntelliJ Scala team - decided it's interesting enough to write about it a bit more.
 So, here's a blog post: https://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/2023/12/21/the-x-ray-mode/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Haskellers,
 I have a question about streaming libraries (streamly, conduit, streaming, etc.). I am trying to write a little application to remap user input events (keyboard, mouse, etc.) so I am dealing with low-volume, lazy streams. Additionally, the actual remapping will depend on a user configuration file. 
 I have gotten suggestions to use a streaming library to represent the basic datatype in my app, something I did look into but quickly abandoned because of a rather daunting amount of choice and considerations. However, now is the time for me to make a decision, since going back and refactoring everything after the fact is going to be a huge time-sink. So:
 I am currently under the impression that the biggest benefit of the streaming libraries is speed, and that that speed is generated by doing ghc-optimization tricks. I am also under the impression that speed is not that important in my domain, and that since I don't know which stream-transformations I will be composing at compile time (since I'll be reading the transformations from user-config), I wouldn't even be able to benefit from these performance gains.
 Is my understanding correct? Am I missing something? My home-rolled solution uses binary and a Chan and async to set up different event readers by parsing from lazy bytestrings, writing to the chan to merge the results, and then represents the input as a lazy, infinite list that then gets passed to my pure remapping engine. It seems to work fine. Am I setting myself up for some unforeseen disaster in the future? 
 The reason I've been avoiding these solutions is also just because my productive time is limited and very unreliable, so the cognitive overhead of a completely new set of abstractions comes with its own cost.
 Thank you for any advice you may proffer.

Yet none of them have really caught on with me, especially when it comes to practicality. I get that if some wrapper (List, Option, IO etc.) should be able to be called a Monad, it has to have some properties, and some laws that it should fulfill. But that still doesn't help me understand it really well, and I will forget the laws the next second and probably won't know how to implement or use a Monad in practicality. 
 Do you happen to have one golden source that made Monads 'click' for you both in what it is from a theoretical point of view, but also how to implement and use them? (Exercises would also be greatly appreciated, but I first need to understand it)

It's used for "ad hoc polymorphism" - how does this help with make a function pure and handle side effects, which I was told to be the focus of FP ? 
 And its implementation in Scala heavily relies on implicit keyword. After doing lots of implicits you can finally replace foo(bar) as bar.foo(). To me this just looks like a way of creating syntax sugar. How is it FP? 
 So I guess it's not FP by itself, but just a way to implement FP feature such as monads. Make sense?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started using Haskell as a replacement for Python, for "ad hoc computing". I guess, rather hope, I'll also write production programs in it some day, but for now I'm just enjoying this beautiful set of well thought out primitives that mathematicians and the countless people behind Haskell have laid at my hands (Thank you all!).
 Recently, GHC has started whining about using head. Now, I understand the motivations etc behind this (or I think I do), and I can see why in certain corporate settings, having a coding convention to disallow the use of head might be a totally appropriate thing to do.
 But I don't think such verboten-ness belongs to the language itself. Haskell is not a monoculture of non-partial programs, I feel it has a wider community than that. When I'm tinkering with stu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had a sports accident a couple weeks ago, looks like my knee's gonna be outta commission for half a year. My job is all walking and running, and since the injury happened on my own time, tough luck. Moved back in with the parents, so not to worry on the starving/freezing part. I have a decent local reputation in my industry, too, so long story short, this is just a very annoying setback. That's the bad news.
 Good news is that obviously, my schedule's freed up. Wanted to get back into reading forever, you can bet that's happening. And lots of things I've wanted to sink my teeth into, but never did for one reason or another. Two of them are emacs, and recreational math.
 My hope is that the reason I've never been able to sit down and work my way through the Petersen book was that I was just too sapped from work and life stuff. And apparently I got six months or so, so I'll have plenty of time to digest it. But. In case it turns out that I'm just lazy and weak, plan is to go through his beginners guide, and follow his advice of having a goal with emacs. I have two:
  
I want to learn how to do Bullet Journal-type of stuff. Make plans, write pieces for myself, that sort of thing. Heard that org-mode isn't any good for longer entries, though, so advice here would be appreciated.
 Something I can practice my math in. From taking notes, to copying out math problems and solving them, so on. I have no clue what this would look like, so again, advice appreciated.

 I need to add scripting capabilities to one my software, i.e. give the user the possibility to write it's own "script" and have the program execute it. Ideally, being able to write such a script as an Haskell EDSL would have been great but I don't think it is possible (or easy). So before rolling out my own language, I was wandering what are the best options ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a condensed version of a problem I've encountered in a rewrite of a project to use associated types instead of multiparameter typeclasses. I want the type signatures in the API to be as clean as possible, and avoid the need for so many type ascriptions in code using the API, which is why I'd like to make this work somehow.
 I have a typeclass A with a non injective associated type Context
 class A a where type Context a 
 so many instances of A can have the same Context.
 Some instances of A are also instances of the class AA, that has two additional associated types, B and C.
 class (A a) => AA a where type B a type C a problematic :: Context a -> B a -> C a -> a 
 The intention is that given a Context, the combination of B a and C a uniquely identify a, but I don't know how to express this.
 I know it's possible to make constraints like
 class A a where type B a = b | b -> a 
 , but what I need is some kind of constraint with multiple parameters, like (Context a, B a, C a) -> a. How can this be achieved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a large file with tables and calculations, and when a part of it is not needed anymore, I like to keep it in the file for later reference. To calculate all the sums and formulas, I do org-table-iterate-buffer-tables, which works fine, but naturally takes a while.
 Could I exempt the older parts of the org file by adding the ARCHIVE tag to the old headings? Or does it only exempt them from agenda views and exporting, as it says in the org manual? It would be great if there were a function to exempt parts of a file when calling org-table-iterate-buffer-tables.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working my way through the exercises in "Function Programming in Scala, 2nd edition", and currently at chapter 11, Monad. The book defines its own Monad trait, and asks for some implementations. I want to verify that my implementations satisfy the Monad laws, so, I'm attempting to create some tests.
 Let me first show a test I wrote for testing Monoid left identity law.
 trait Monoid[A]: ... trait MonoidLaws { this: AnyFunSpec & ScalaCheckPropertyChecks => def leftIdentityLaw[A: Arbitrary: Monoid]: Unit = val instanceM = summon[Monoid[A]] 
 The tests are called as shown below:
 describe("Integers form a Monoid under addition"): import MonoidInstances.intAddition leftIdentityLaw[Int] rightIdentityLaw[Int] associativityLaw[Int] 
 Along the same lines, Monad and Monad laws:
 trait Functor[F[_]]: ... trait Monad[F[_]] extends Functor[F]: ... def leftIdentityLaw[A: Arbitrary, B: Arbitrary[A => F[B]]](using mA: Monad[F]): Unit = it("should satisfy the left identity law"): forAll { (x: A, f: A => F[B]) => mA.unit(x).flatMap(f) shouldBe f(x) } 
 However, the leftIdentityLaw test doesn't compile. What would be the corect type signature for it?
 Edit:
 After some trial and error, I found the a working solution, but I don't like it having an unused arbAToFB name.
 trait MonadLaws[F[_]] { this: AnyFunSpec & ScalaCheckPropertyChecks => def leftIdentityLaw[A: Arbitrary, B: Arbitrary](using arbAToFB: Arbitrary[A => F[B]], mA: Monad[F]): Unit = it("should satisfy the left identity law"): forAll { (x: A, f: A => F[B]) => mA.unit(x).flatMap(f) shouldBe f(x) }

 I just started trying org, org-roam, and org-roam-bibtex for my note-taking workflow, and I found them fantastic. However, I ran into one problem that I cannot customize them to open the corresponding paper pdf of any org-roam file using Google Chrome.
 What I want to achieve is that after pressing C-c C-o on the following ROAM_REFS, 
 https://preview.redd.it/jn4cx4qeha7c1.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=53bbf2a567aeb177afaa81f37124273c0d017337
 by pressing p in the following popup window, the pdf will be opened in Google Chrome.

 What I tried is to modify the variable org-file-apps, like below.
 https://preview.redd.it/b5d4n5oxha7c1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac1bb850b6a37a510dc88a127e7a450514fee13e
 What I observed is that now when I export my org-roam notes to pdf, e.g. pressing C-c C-e l o, it will be opened in Google Chrome. But when I press p in the popup window, the corresponding pdf of the original paper is still not opened in Google Chrome.
 How could I solve this? I appreciate any help you can provide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are things about data engineering I've really enjoyed, but after 2 years it has started to become quite stale and boring. The part of the job I have enjoyed the most is when I get to work with python and spark (the more software engineery stuff with data engineering). So given that scala is the language spark was written in, and what many data engineers had been using for a long time (and some still do), I decided it could be worthwhile learning.
 Also, I'd really like to transition into a more software engineering centric role in my next job, and have been learning Scala as a means by which to achieve this. My logic was that if I learn Scala the worst case scenario is that I get better at coding, (data engineering with python will only take you so far in terms of developing software engineering skills), and even though it is dying out as a language for DE in favour of python, it might help with employability for DE jobs. The upside is I may be able to get a Scala Developer/Engineer role that pays better, and which I may be better suited to and enjoy more.
 After reading a lot of posts on this subreddit, it seems people are growing increasingly pessimistic regarding the employability of scala, so I wanted some general advice regarding my approach. My current plan has been: Learn Scala -> Personal Projects -> Scala Data Engineer / Scala Engineer -> Scala Engineer/Developer. From what I have seen online Scala Engineer Jobs in my area (London) are very lucrative but I imagine there is a high barrier to entry, and worry that this transition isn't realistic.
 I'm currently working through the Scala RocktheJVM course and am enjoying what I have learnt so far, and will likely continue regardless. Any advice/thoughts would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a recurring issue for me when I do Advent of Code, which I do in Haskell - some problems are really suited for using memoization. I tried to condense my confusion to as close to the pain point as possible, and I am hoping someone here can help me understand where my thinking goes wrong. Here is a code block with a few different ways of calculating a Fibonacci sequence:
 import Data.Function.Memoize main :: IO () main = do -- slow print $ fib 35 -- fast print $ fibMemo 35 -- slow print $ (memoize fibMemo2) 35 fib :: Int -> Int fib 0 = 1 fib 1 = 1 fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2) fibMemo :: Int -> Int fibMemo = memoize fib' where fib' 0 = 1 fib' 1 = 1 fib' n = fibMemo (n-1) + fibMemo (n-2) fibMemo2 :: Int -> Int fibMemo2 0 = 1 fibMemo2 1 = 1 fibMemo2 n = (memoize fibMemo2) (n-1) + (memoize fibMemo2) (n-2) 
 Note here that two functions are really slow - both the first and last one. But in my mind, the second one (which is fast) is exactly the same as the third one (which is slow). What is the difference here? Both of them recursively call memoize on themselves, which tells me I am missing something critical.

For the past several years, I’ve been primarily using and writing notes on my laptop. When I needed to access these notes on the go, I used 1Writer. I treated this as a read-only exercise. I didn’t really trust the syncing, and so I would use Drafts to jot down something that I wanted to add to my notes later. 1Writer was initially terrible for searching 10,000 files, and so made even read-only access somewhat pointless. However, a note to the developer improved things significantly, and then learning to sort by title rather than by other attributes, made 10,000 notes workable. Still, this was always going to be my last resort platform.

I recently discovered the Zettelkasten method and was instantly intrigued. Currently I am in school studying Software Development and have always wanted to learn Game Development on top of that.
I've been looking for how to notes from schooling and game development and turn it into a Zettelkasten to help me along my journey but can't find a lot of resources on it and the few I do, it doesn't make sense to me.
Any help is much appreciated!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm doing monoids from CIS 194. Below are functions/data I will talk about: ``` {- For learning purpose I have rewritten Monoid to Monoid' and mempty with mappend to mempty' and mappend' -}
 newtype Product a = Product {getProduct' :: Integer} deriving (Show, Ord, Eq, Num)
 instance Num a => Monoid' (Product a) where mempty' = Product 1 mappend' = (*)
 getProduct :: Product Integer -> Integer getProduct (Product x) = x
 prod :: [Integer] -> Integer prod = getProduct' . mconcat' . map Product ``` Now the problem I have is, if I use getProduct' from record syntax, I have error in prod function "Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘mconcat'’ prevents the constraint ‘(Monoid' (Product a0))’ from being solved." but If I use getProduct, that is function defined under Product, everything works. Why is it like that, is record syntax is hiding something from me?
 EDIT: Added Monoid' (Product a) instance on comment request.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I wrote a quick minesweeper clone in scala.js w/ laminar to test them out. Website is here, code here.
 Besides the code not being the cleanest (beginner programmer – all advice welcome), there's one bug I haven't been able to crush: on Firefox you can accidentally right-click a cleared square and get a context menu popup. This is not desirable, as it at best slows you down and at worst leads to accidentally leaving the page via said menu.
 Relevant code from Main.scala:
 dom.document.addEventListener("contextmenu", e => e.preventDefault()) 
 On Chromium things work as expected – no context menu anywhere, ever.
 What I've tried:
  
onContextMenu --> { e => e.preventDefault() } literally everywhere: buttons, tbody, table etc.
 onContextMenu --> { e => println("here") } similarly everywhere to find out that when right-clicking a disabled button, nothing on the page seems to receive the pointer event, meaning there's nothing to block it, which then leads to Firefox opening the context menu
 pointer-events: none; for disabled buttons, which breaks things on (at least some) mobile browsers since the browser thinks that a tap on a disabled button was "really" meant for its neighbour, which is... not good!
  
So, is this something that needs to be fixed in Firefox, or am I missing something obvious?
 Thanks.
 edit. This is a Firefox bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1543196 
 Minimal reproducible example for this particular case just because:
 <!DOCTYPE html> <head> <style> body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 100vh; } </style> </head> <body oncontextmenu="return false;"> <button>No context menu</button> <button disabled="true">Context menu :(</button> </body> </html>

 I watched a video by Alexis king about laziness but I don’t have patience for videos so didn’t finish it.
 Can you please give me an idea of what benefits laziness brings to Haskell? And can you share of a paper or a good blog post that talks about this? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, I had a moment of reflection and realized how fortunate I am to be part of a community that embraces functional programming as a livelihood. It's not about intelligence, but rather standing on the shoulders of giants—open source maintainers, content creators, the Scala Centre, EPFL and everyone that makes this community welcoming for people like me.
 I want to express my sincere appreciation to the entire ecosystem and the individuals who contribute to it. Scala changed my life for the better and for all the trash it gets sometimes, it made me fall in love with programming again, and it is great to get paid for something you would do for free either way.
 Amidst the ups and downs, Scala has been a source of inspiration, reminding me of the joy of playing with math and computers for a living. Thanks to everyone who makes this possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there!
 I have recently made the switch from Obsidian to Emacs Org-mode, and it's been a delight. Yet, I found one important issue that keeps bugging me: 
 I tried to install org-roam from MELPA, which caused my org to be automatically updated from my current version (9.3) to the more recent one (9.6). 
 The problem is, whenever this happens, I lose all my configurations, together with functionality of org-mode, web-mode and other stuff I've installed. Instead, I am greeted by this: (invalid-function org-assert-version), and a message saying there was a problem in loading the configuration file. Running Emacs --debug-init on the terminal would create a long list of errors. The only way to solve this is by going into my ~/.emacs.d/elpa/ directory and manually removing the files for the updated org mode version.
 For reference, all my configurations are in a ~/.emacs document.
 How can I update org-mode without loosing all my configs?
 Thanks a lot!
 P.S. I'm fairly new to programming and Emacs, sorry if this was not properly oriented or if there is information missing.

Equivalence problems with StreamGraph by Jonathan Dowland
The StrIoT Logical Optimiser applies a set of rewrite rules to a stream-processing program, generating a set of variants that can be reasoned about, ranked, and deployed. The problem I’ve been tackling is that a variant may appear to be semantically equivalent to another, but compare (with ==) as distinct.

        <link href="https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2756/question-evolving-ideas-contradictions-how-to-manage-non-truth-in-a-zettelkasten"/>
        <updated>2023-12-13T22:51:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
I come to you, specialists and sages of the Zettelkasten, in a quest to understand something I cannot wrap my head around… 
I've read How to Take Smart Notes, I've practiced the method successfully for writing fiction, but there is something I cannot yet figure (or maybe need validation to implement?).
How do you manage that which you know you do not know, or do not know enough, or realize you did not know? That is:
How do you manage questions, which can be ongoing on life? ("How to be a good man in the 21st Century?")
How do you navigate and evolve forming practices? (Like: the Zettelkasten method, which you hone in through practice, and evolve insight: "this works for me, I should pay attention to that")
How do you walk back on ideas that do not serve you anymore, or that you realize were false? (like an early 20st Century scientist witnessing the ether being disproved, meaning all theories and constructs pertaining to it become completely irrelevant apart from scientific history)
I guess the underlying issue is "transient" content, which is a little bit at odds with the concept of permanent / evergreen note / Zettel. Now I know a Zettelkasten is personal, that truth is unattainable and everything is potentially transient – please bear with me here 🙂 I also know, in Luhmann's words, that the Zettelkasten is a "septic tank".
And yet. What would be best practices for capturing accruing, unformed ideas and questions, which would free the user by knowing they will not pollute the system down the road if they turn out to be dead ends?
Is it a simple matter of trusting that linking will isolate irrelevant content? Or should you prune links later, remove notes – but potentially destroying the path of thinking that led you to where you are now? Is it a much simpler matter of redirecting the energy of the system simply by altering the geometry of structure notes?
Any insight and especially technical approaches would be hugely appreciated. Thank you!]]></summary>

I did found some sty files, but all of them have multiline definitions, so I cannot just put a #+LATEX_HEADER: behind every line. neither can I just make a macro and deal with it manually as it is more than 1000 lines long.
 Is there a way to use it directly or any convenient way to change it? Any other way to write proof trees would also work.

 this is a sample piece of code from the tikz automata library.
 Also I use Doom Emacs, and I am sort of new.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey
 I've working for the past couple of days on a tree-sitter based major mode for TLA+.
 From Wikipedia
  
TLA+ is a formal specification language developed by Leslie Lamport [the La of Latex] It is used for designing, modelling, documentation, and verification of programs, especially concurrent systems and distributed systems. 
  
And PlusCal 
  
PlusCal (formerly called +CAL) is a formal specification language, which transpiles to TLA+. PlusCal most resembles an imperative programming language
  
The mode offers syntax highlighting for most TLA+ / PlusCal Syntax, and basic imenu navigation. Code formatting is work in progress (TLA+ having significant indendation is in my point of view a significant challenge).
 Any feedback is welcome.
 The work is inspired by tla-mode, and this page  has been an invaluable help.
 PS. No idea how advent of code submission work here, so feel free to edit the title to use as as submission if it makes sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of curiosity, has anyone gotten the pdf-tools package work in Windows (specifically 10)? I've found a few options:
  
Trying to build with msys2 -- doesn't seem to like my msys2 configuration from Chocolatey. At the very least, it won't install and run make successfully.
 Tried out a precompiled pdf-tools -- this is about 5-6 years old at this date, and while there's libraries, and I added it to load-path and brought it in with require, it still was not particularly happy. It acted as if it'd never been properly installed.
  
Just curious. The baked in DocView is adequate for my needs as if I were to print it properly, I'd use a full PDF viewer like Sumatra. However DocView is pretty grainy in rendering and my eyes would appreciate it if I found a slightly better solution.
 I'm editing Typst documents with live PDF update, so it's nice to have another pane with the rendered document on the fly (mostly -- it's not the live update their website Rust app has, but it's close enough for me for now.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I am an IT student, and was given the task to install Leancheck. I managed to do that by following the instructions on: https://github.com/rudymatela/leancheck/blob/master/README.md
 Now it works if I do "ghci" and then "import Test.LeanCheck". 
 My problem arrised when I tried to do "stack ghci", which also is required by my professor. Typing "stack ghci" opens ghci, with the following message: 
 PS /filePath/> stack ghci
 ​
 Note: No local targets specified, so a plain ghci will be started with no package hiding or package options.
 ​
 You are using snapshot: lts-21.24
 ​
 If you want to use package hiding and options, then you can try one of the following:
 ​
 * If you want to start a different project configuration
 than /filePath/\stack\global-project\stack.yaml, then you can use stack init to create a new
 stack.yaml for the packages in the current directory.
 ​
 * If you want to use the project configuration
 at /filePath/\stack\global-project\stack.yaml, then you can add to its 'packages' field.
 ​
 Configuring GHCi with the following packages:
 GHCi, version 9.4.8: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/ :? for help
 Loaded GHCi configuration from /filePath/\stack\ghci-script\2a3bbd58\ghci-script
 ghci>
 Typing "import Tests.Leancheck" results in: 
 <no location info>: error:
 Could not find module `Tests.Leancheck'
 It is not a module in the current program, or in any known package. 
 ​
 my stack.yaml file: 
 packages: []
 extra-deps:
 - leancheck-1.0.0
 resolver: lts-21.24 
 My config.yaml file is fully standard.
 ​
 I have to get the imports to work on a global basis. So I should be able to cd into anny directory, start "stack ghci" and then be abl to use "import Tests.Leancheck". 
 Thanks for the help fellow IT wizards :)

 https://preview.redd.it/9tyh172cel5c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=74582a8bd4f76c2f37f2ef30314bae0181bb41e2
 EDIT: Is this kind of feature not generally desired in the emacs community? I thought anyone who takes notes and organizes things in org-mode would have value in having this option. Or maybe it is too much of a headache?

 Hiya! Mainly been a lurker here (also just a lurker in general) during my emacs journey the past few months.
 Hurl is a cli tool for sending HTTP requests (using cURL under the hood) in plain text format similar to https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el but can be used outside emacs and also has some additional testing utilities built in. For more info see the hurl home page: https://hurl.dev/ 
 Hurl does have an emacs mode included but I wanted a few more features than what was already provided like graphql/json fontification, so I gave my own shot at trying to create a major mode as well as an exercise to learning more elisp.
 Thought I'd open up a new repo for this so I can incorporate any feedback from the community faster and then maybe see if I can incorporate this into the main hurl repo.
 Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've switched from vim to emacs recently with evil mode. It's been a great experience so far however, I'm facing an issue with js2-mode syntax highlighting. I appreciate that web-mode is designed for mixed syntax files, if you're say working with templates for front-end web-dev, however I have found it provides far superior syntax highlighting than js2-mode. I haven't noticed any other difference between js2-mode and web-mode apart from this, I guess I've only scratched the surface. I primarily work with js and json files for node.js back-end development and only touch front-end, where I guess web-mode would be excellent a minority of the time. The error highlighting seems to be same for both, driven by lsp-mode. I haven't touched ESlint yet (been using ts-ls so far), only just installed it.
 I guess my questions boil down to:
 Why should I use 1 over the other especially given the syntax highlighting preference?
 How does flycheck / flymake play into this, what are the differences?
 Is it fine to run 2 language servers for lsp-mode / how does that work? Using lsp-describe-session shows both of them running?
 As a side-note does anyone have a config with lsp-ui and peek that they're willing share for some inspiration / things I've missed.
 I also have tern running is this required?
 Thank you in advance.

 Someone writes a blog post talking about some changes made to Emacs he didn't like and how his efforts to ameliorate the effects have been seemingly rejected, and how that seems to be a sign or major change in the Emacs development culture.
 He goes on to add that some of his complaints are hyperbole and goes on to create his own fork of Emacs - for real?
 Then all hell breaks loose here and on HN
 Come on guys, there is war in Palestine with thousands dying a more to come, some earthquakes occurring here and there, climate crises, chronic hunger, starvation and what nots in many parts of the world.
 Try to maintain some perspective.
 Do some people know what hyperbole means? Have they never bothered to look it up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I just finished a computational physics class at university. They used Python. We had a browser based program that used a VM to store our files, and we edited everything on jupyter notebook. I basically had everything setup for me in the class at school. I didn't initialize or setup any of the programs.
 ​
 The class inspired me to try and code more here at home, I just got a book, Learning Physics with Functional Programming. They use Haskell as the language. I've got a macbook, and I have no idea how to set anything up. I barely understand what I'm doing. Believe me I've been watching tutorial after tutorial, but there's always some error I get that these tutorials don't address. I'm trying to become code literate.
 ​
 In that case I thought maybe I could get help here? I went to Haskell.org, and used the terminal command from there to install GHcup. Afterwards, I opened up VScode and downloaded the Haskell extension. Then, I tried to start a new project and begin working along the book I bought. 
 The problem is that anytime I set Haskell as my language for a new note in VScode, it gives the error that "Project requires GHcup but it isn't installed. Source: Haskell (extension)"
 ​
 I've tried going into my ~bash file to inspect the path of the GHcup file, but the terminal denies me access to it. I'm not even sure if that's what would help fix this either, but I saw a lot of reference to this on Haskell Troubleshooting forum links from VScode.
 ​
 Sorry for my incapability... this kinda makes me want to keep using my whiteboard for physics but I really want to be able to do bigger calculations on a computer, and not on Python.
 ​
 If I could get any help I'd appreciate it a lot

I've been really busy, and emacs have been nothing but trouble, debugging and configuration. It just stopped me from working efficiently. I finally understood what people mean by "Don't let your editor get in your way". It just stopped me from learning this new technology, and had me configuring and finding good packages that allow me to program with it in emacs, and occasionally debugging the previously installed packages like lsp, because either the autocompletion box doesn't show up, or lsp just spits some errors and shuts down.
 Then I used vscode, and wow! Everything just worked and I didn't need to config anything. But vscode is a pain too. It's not foss, and you have to use your mouse a lot.
 My rant is finished. Do you have any advice/roast for me?

 I am trying to set up company and can't get it to autoload with use-package. Here is what I have based on the company docs:
  (use-package company :ensure t :hook (after-init-hook . global-company-mode)) 
 This does not seem to enable company mode. 
 I tried adding :config (global-company-mode 1) which seemingly did nothing. In either case, if I C-x C-e I see global-company-mode at the bottom of my screen, but C-h m shows that it is not enabled.
 If I run M-x global-company-mode it shows that global company mode is disabled. If I run it again, it says that it's enabled and I can confirm it is working.
 What am I missing here?

 How exactly do I get a Haskell job? I’m in the US. No professional experience so I’m entry level.
 What backend web framework should I learn? Yesod or servant? Or snap? Or some other one?
 And what do I need to know?
 I’ve implemented a linear algebra library in Haskell with a servant api. But I want to invest some time into Haskell to get a job.
 Thanks

 When issues pertaining to multithreading inevitably came up in a talk, I made a low-brow passing comment about an "Emacs-STM" fork. It was meant to be tongue-in-cheek, but karma has it that this mind virus has now caught hold of my thoughts. Not the fork part of course, but definitely the STM part.
 If we take a longer view, say multi-decade ("the next 40 years"), do we expect the collaborative form we have now to be the ultimate resolution? I ask because some would readily dismiss the topic altogether, whereas a longer-term view may induce looking beyond the more urgent and immediate, I would think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know one way to do this, but hoping there's something simpler or more general. clangd (C++ LSP server) is over-aggressive about adding "helpful" #includes during completion. The way to turn that off is to pass -header-insertion=never on its cmd line.
 In eglot with recent trunk emacs, the C-related modes are configured by default like this, in eglot-server-programs:  ((c-mode c-ts-mode c++-mode c++-ts-mode) . ,(eglot-alternatives '("clangd" "ccls"))) 
 So I could splice that out and replace it, for sure. But then I lose the alternative of using ccls if that's what's installed, and it seems fragile with all the ts- stuff happening these days. So my question is, is there a way to configure eglot to say "when invoking clangd, always pass -header-insertion=never? And if not, would that be a useful addition? (Maybe a filter function to process the results of eglot--guess-contact?)

Judging by popularity, my most useful packages are:
  
devdocs.el: Documentation reader with quick and handy lookup commands. It is similar to the built-in Info reader, but has a different (likely larger) document coverage.
 code-cells: Utilities to work with “lightweight notebooks”, that is, source code which is split into cells by special %% comments. Also allows you to transparently edit Jupyter notebook (ipynb) files.
  
Combined with the above, these two packages can help setting up a nice Python editing environment (although there's nothing Python-specific about them):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/emacs. I've been using Emacs for a few years now but please, treat me as a total beginner!
 Magit is one of the most incredible tools available but it is frustratingly slow on big git repos, especially when they're located on a slow file system. I very often find myself giving 2-3 commands in a row and only seeing the output in a few seconds.
 E.g. I'd type (1) f u to fetch all, then (2) r e to trigger rebase elsewhere and then start typing (3) /mast so the counsel wrapper can find origin/master and then I press Enter. I basically do all steps (1)-(3) and will only see any output >5s later.
 This definitely breaks the workflow and I would at least expect Emacs not to freeze between inputs (1), (2) and (3) and just give me clues that there's a process running in background.
 Is it something possible or should I try to use some optimisation tricks to do less on every magit operation?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a followup post for https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/14dej62/please_help_collecting_statistics_to_optimize/
 Thanks everyone who submitted the data!
 I have now summarized everything. You can find the analysis in my EmacsConf2023 presentation - https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/gc/ and https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10213384 (reproducible analysis).
 The key takeaways from the above analysis:
 For users:
  
Emacs freezes due to GC are real
 … but not for all users
 When GC does get Emacs slower, it is either 
 slow startup ⇒ increase gc-cons-threshold to 20-80Mb check gc-elapsed after startup
 slow and frequent GC ⇒ increase gc-cons-percetage to 0.2-1.0 but watch Emacs RAM usage
 
  
For Emacs devs:
  
GC problem is very real for many users (9% of GCs are both frequent and slow)
 It is worth bumping gc-cons-threshold temporarily during startup
 Ideally, we should switch from Mark&Sweep to something more performant
 May increase gc-cons-percetage, but need to get user data for optimal numbers
  
Further plans:
  
With the collected data we can hopefully continue emacs-devel discussion on changing GC defaults and get somewhere. https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/20230310110747.4hytasakomvdyf7i@Ergus/
 
emacs-gc-stats package has now served its purpose, but I think that it might still be useful for people who want to toy around GC settings. I plan to add some kind of "session summary" command that will display the key statistics of current user session. It should help understanding the effects of GC customization on the performance.

I would like to introduce my first emacs package (and my first public code, please be gentle): emacs-goodnight
 This little minor mode will switch between two themes (usually dark and light) at sunset/sunrise or at user specified time. It will also switch you system theme.
 ​
 I wrote this package because I didn't know circadian.el existed.

Previous advent calendar days: day 7, day 6, day 5, day 4, day 3, day 2, day 1.

I've found the variable impacting this behaviour called `content-dir` in the `~/.local/straight/repos/ox-hugo/ox-hugo.el` but modifying the code doesn't seem effective.
 I guess I'm not doing the right way. How to customize the packages and make it effective?
 BTW I'm not a programmer and know very little about elisp.

This talk outlines what LBM is today, what people use it for, how it works internally and how it performs.

Swimming with Ideas
This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Please be courageous and add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
I have been contemplating the concept of intelligence density and its implications. My focus has been on my own intellectual capacity and how to make improvements. I have noticed a significant lack of intellectual richness in what little media I'm exposed to.
A note requires a UUID, but the need to have it in the filename is unclear. Is this just forced on us because of a past nostalgic habit?
My productivity is negatively impacted by a decline in focus in the evening hours. I plan to implement a new routine scheduled for 8:00 PM to steer my performance consciously. We'll see if this approach is successful.
I'm done with Air Quality, Pollution & Smoke GEOL454, onto Young Adult Literature EDCI445 university class. I have a short winter break in which to focus on programming and woodworking.
Things I'm reading: all fiction for a change.
Difficult loves. Calvino, Italo. 1970. - Relationships
Heartburn. Ephron, Nora. 1983. - Food/relationship Fiction
The path to the spiders' nests. Calvino, Italo. 1947. - WW2 Youth Literature
Lessons in chemistry. Garmus, Bonnie. 2022. - Humor
Music I'm listening to:
Adele
Tone Ranger

The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

 This what I mean by abbreviations the actual terminology may be different,eg.
 [[:alnum:]], [[:upper:]], [[:space:]], [[:xdigit:]] etc, to show some of the ones at regex101.com.
 Recreating the exact sequences I use for my own purposes can be difficult, so I would like to extend these kind of abbreviationss with some of my own sequences, ie give them a short name which is recompiled into the rx library.
 Does the rx library and any others have such features?
 UPDATE:
 I just noticed an rx-extra macro at Emacs Wiki: rx which has such a feature.

I swear it was December 7 when I started writing this post. :)
 By far my three most popular packages are:
  
orderless. A highly configurable completion style that matches multiple patterns in any order against minibuffer completion candidates.
 embark. The one I always struggle to explain, so instead go read u/karthink's wonderful blog post about it! Prodded by u/minad-emacs, I just released version 1.0! 🎉 
 marginalia. Informative annotations for minibuffer completion candidates, co-written with u/minad-emacs.
  
Packages I haven't put on MELPA or GNU ELPA, but I know some people use:
  
math-delimiters. Provides a nice command to insert LaTeX math delimiters and to toggle between inline and display versions of them.
 placeholder. On the fly ephemeral snippets: need to send a bunch of similar emails just this once so you don't want to bother making a skeleton, tempo or yasnippet template for them? Use placeholder!
 epithet. Give descriptive names to buffers.
  
Tiny, tiny packages in my personal configuration that I think someone may want to steal:
  
block-undo. Have keyboard macros undo in a single step (something vi gets right!).
 ffap-eshell. Make ffap correctly guess in more cases the directory containing a file name you find in an eshell buffer.
 shr-heading. Navigate between headings in an eww buffer (or more generally, shr buffer), also enables imenu.
 eval-region-advice. Advise evaluation commands to evaluate the region if active.
  
Finally, something useless which I've found fun (but haven't grown as much as I thought I would):
  
luggage. A Largely Undesired Gadget: a Generative Art Gallery for Emacs.
  
Previous advent calendar days: day 6, day 5, day 4, day 3, day 2, day 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For work, I sometimes need to forward emails I receive in HTML format, and I need the forwarded email to include the original HTML format. Do folks have a way to do this in mu4e they could share? 
 I can, using org-mime, compose HTML emails if I need to. I also can view HTML emails using xwidgets. And I can attach the HTML email to an outgoing message using mu4e-action-capture-message and mu4e-compose-attach-captured-message. But is there a way to make the HTML content of the original email so that it's rendered inline as it were? (Sorry, I'm not sure I got the terminology right here...)
 I tried looking at the raw message I capture with mu4e-action-capture-message, thinking I might be able to (a) open that file, (b) find the HTML content I need, and (c) insert it as an html part. But I didn't have much luck. (For one thing, the HTML bit of the raw email doesn't render the same as the original one somehow.) 
 I'm close to a sort of working solution, by just replacing disposition=attachment with disposition=inline in the output of calling mu4e-compose-attach-captured-message. But I feel like I don't quite understand what I'm doing and would appreciate any pointers or suggestions.
 (I've searched around and found a few discussions of issues related to this, but nothing there seemed to help with my particular issue---there's an issue at the mu repo which prompted me to use the capture+attach workflow I mentioned above, but that's the closest I've got to an answer so far...)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're using the Mill build tool, are you similarly frustrated about the lack of a standard project structure? The following sources each use a different structure.
  
The Scala Days talk on YouTube.
 A Hello World project made by Alvin Alexander.
 A mill-scala-hello Gitter template.
 The ScalaCon talk on YouTube.
  
I had filed a GitHub ticket, but it was closed as "out of scope". I'm not sure why the maintainers insisted on perpetuating the ambiguity, and would like to know your opinion about the following. None of the references above answer these very basic and very important questions.
  
A recommended single-module project structure including unit tests and a non-default package (i.e. files not directly under src). The assumption is that a multi-module project is simply a collection of several single-module (potentially interdependent) projects.
 Separation of Java and Scala source code in a mixed project.
 Separation of unit and integration tests in a multi-module project.
 Separation of main and test resources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just recently, GNU Emacs maintainer Stefan Kangas mentioned in his talk on Emacsconf 2023 that contributions to the Tree-Sitter based modes are very welcome and much appreciated. I agree with this very much.
 Built-in and external JS-related modes
 JS-related modes built into Emacs core:
  
js-mode
 js-jsx-mode
 js-ts-mode
 typescript-ts-mode
 tsx-ts-mode
  
External modes that replace and/or build on core modes:
  
js2-mode: https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode
 rjsx-mode: https://github.com/felipeochoa/rjsx-mode
 js3-mode: https://github.com/tamzinblake/js3-mode
 web-mode: https://web-mode.org/
 jtsx: https://github.com/llemaitre19/jtsx
 tsx-mode: https://github.com/orzechowskid/tsx-mode.el
 ultimate-js-mode: https://github.com/guillaumebrunerie/ultimate-js-mode
  
An external minor mode: https://codeberg.org/ckruse/tsx-ts-helper-mode
 Request to Contribute to Emacs Core
 Instead of splitting our efforts, let's bundle our resources and make Emacs core better. I appeal to all external JS-related package maintainers to contribute parts of their packages to Emacs core. Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Install GnuGP version 2.4.1. or higher.
 
From the command line, symmetrically encrypt a test file.
 $ echo 'test' > test.txt $ gpg --symmetric test.txt
 
Open the file encrypted file, test.txt.gpg in Emacs version 29 or higher. You should be prompted for the passphrase you used to encrypt the file in the previous step.
 
Edit the file.
 
M-x toggle-debug-on-quit
 
Save the file. Emacs will hang. C-g to quit. You will see a backtrace which indicates Emacs was stuck in a loop inside epg-wait-for-status.
 
Execute the following well-intentioned advice found scattered throughout unofficial Emacs support channels:
 (fset 'epg-wait-for-status 'ignore)
 
Save the file again! Horay! It saved!
 
You now have a corrupt symmetrically encrypted file! Try decrypting it!
 $ gpg --decrypt test.txt.gpg
 
Now you don't ever have to worry about the file again! Remember to do this to your backups if you'd like to corrupt those as well.
 
 The real solution is to downgrade GnuPG. DO NOT USE (fset 'epg-wait-for-status 'ignore)! It's the equivalent of blowing through a stop sign and hoping your car doesn't get hit.

Currently, I find it very annoying to use readSTRef, writeSTRef, modifySTRef, and all the monad functions. It would be nice to have a "lifted" function that could accept values of 'ST s a', 'STRef s a', and 'a' and return the result 'ST s b'.
 Is there a package that already accomplishes this? If not, it would be nice to have a helper lift function that allows something like
 lift :: (a -> b) -> m -> ST s b lift' :: (a -> b -> c) -> m -> n -> ST s c -- example lifted functions not' = lift not (^>^) = lift' (>) 
 I have tried couple of implementations for lift but have not been successful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although I have been studying functional programming in Haskell (and Agda) as part of my university course for over a year now, and we’ve covered the basics and more advanced topics like monads, states, writing interpreters etc., I’d like to start from scratch to revise and strengthen my knowledge, thus I composed a list of books to do so.
 Stage 1: Basics - Programming in Haskell
 Stage 2: Advanced topics - Real World Haskell - Haskell in Depth
 Stage 3: Specialised topics - Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell - Functional Design and Architecture (early-access)
 To those who have read some (or perhaps all) of these books, would you recommend them in this order? Individual book opinions are welcomed too, or if you think I should take a look at another, non-mentioned book, feel free to share!
 Thank you in advance!
 PS: I am familiar with the book ‘Haskell Programming from First Principle’, which AFAIK covers not just the basics, but advanced topics as well. My only issue with it, and consequently the reason why it is not on the list, is that it has no physical edition available anymore, and I’d like to stick with those books that have one. About ‘Learn You a Haskell for Good!’; it had some rather poor reviews on the sub so I ditched it. ‘Programming in Haskell’ seems more professional and serious anyways. But if you’ve read both of them, do tell your experience.

 I just changed theme to modus-operandi-tinted, and I really like it. One thing I would like to change is to make the background color of the line numbers face the same color as the background color of the buffer. I tried looking in the documentation (https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes), but I can only find how to change the styling of the line numbers (6.2.21. Make line numbers use alternative styles).
 Any help is appreciated!

 I'm using vscode with haskell plugin and it's driving me mad.
 It seems to be working every now and then, or with some features seemingly broken, or it's behavior doesn't reflect the latest change.
 Also in the extension output it generates a lot of errors, and I have no ideas if that's normal.
 I don't even know it is supposed to work. How can I know that whether it's really working properly, all the time, with every feature working?
 For example, how can I jump to functions defined in src/Lib.sh from reference in App/Main.hs? In other languages I just use ctrl+] (I'm using vim plugin).
 And suppose I want to use Data.ByteString.Base64.encode, is there supposed to be a shortcut to import it, instead of manually typing the statement?

In my opinion, this could be handy as some functions can really be better thought of as properties of a datatype, and doing so doesn’t preclude you from also using it as a function in cases where it reads more naturally (and of course, pass it on to higher order functions).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks in advance for the help!
 I have a couple very long org files that are essentially dumping grounds for notes for large projects. I'd like to refactor them into smaller files in subfolders. One, for example, is for a book project, and there are characters, scenes, background notes, etc., and it would be much nicer to break it up into many files. However, when doing this, I want to be able to quickly find all the files relevant to a specific topic, even if they aren't currently open.
 I don't see a way that searching by tags or similar looks for files that are not currently open in a buffer.
 I've been using org-roam more and more these days, mostly because finding notes in it is easier. One solution might be to simply convert 100% of my org files over to org-roam and essentially use org-roam as a search / file open tool.
 But is there a way in more "pure" org-mode to quickly search through a whole mess of files and bring up only the ones with specific tags?

 I am trying to be able to edit or view org files in the Google drive mobile app. 
 My set up is a folder synced with rclone to Google drive. But the problem is that the mime type of org files is inode and not txt. So I think if I tell rclone to sync and set the .org files mine type to txt, that can work.
 If you have any better solution or the method on changing the mime type of org files to txt, I am all ears. Looks like Google drive is horrible in Linux. 
 All in all, thank you for your time!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Haskellers,
 I've been struggling with some really weird behavior for the last few hours now and I can't seem to figure it out, maybe that someone here can help? I've narrow the actual problem down to 2 very stripped down scenarios, 1 that works, and 1 that doesn't. Both are being run in exactly the same simple IO function that just grabs a lazy bytestring that is being generated from an evdev file and feeds it to the function and tries to print the result.
 works :: L.ByteString -> [ByteString] works = L.foldrChunks chomp [] where chomp b acc = b : acc doesnot :: L.ByteString -> [ByteString] doesnot = fst . L.foldrChunks chomp ([], []) where chomp b (acc, bcc) = (b : acc, b : bcc) test :: IO () test = do withEvdev "/dev/input/by-id/usb-Technomancy_Atreus-event-kbd" $ \byts -> do mapM_ print $ works byts -- mapM_ print $ doesnot byts 
 The first function works as expected, it returns a lazy list of strict bytestrings that accumulate as keyboard events are generated. And the testing function prints out data as it comes in. The second function simply will not ever run. I've covered it with trace statements and changed the accumulator to undefineds and the pattern matches to underscores. Doesn't change anything. Somehow changing the accumulator to a tuple seems to turn the whole handling of the loop strict?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can somebody help me with this: I'm trying to bolt sbt-native-packager onto an existing project. The instructions make it seem easy, just add this to the plugins.sbt file:
 addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-native-packager" % "1.9.16")
 ...and then add some configuration to build.sbt
 I'm failing at the first step. I get this error when trying to sbt reload:
 [error] (update) sbt.librarymanagement.ResolveException: Error downloading com.typesafe.sbt:sbt-native-packager;sbtVersion=1.0;scalaVersion=2.12:1.9.16
 I'm actually using Scala 3.3.1 , so why is it picking up the packager for a much older version of the language? And this seems pretty suss... the MVN Central page for SBT Native Packager:
 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.sbt/sbt-native-packager_2.12_1.0
 Seems to have a version that might also correspond to an old version of Scala. What am I misunderstanding here? Can I not use Scala 3 with this packaging tool?

 ​
 I use Gnus for pretty simple stuff for centralising 5 mails and, 2 more to come, I know that Gmail and outlook work without issue, and I've fixed some notifications issue in MacOS, since growlnotify is not working in my latest MacOS version.
 ​
 For the two more two go, I will be implementing in one of them Outlook, in which I wonder if you guys have any configuration I can take a look at, since I haven't done anything regarding outlook and posts about it seem to be pretty old. Perhaps it may just be the simple 'get an application password' like Email.
 ​
 Aside from that, I have pretty simple mail sending capabilities and no contacts support, so I only use it to reply and, have posting styles so I always reply to the email I got the email from.
 ​
 Another thing I would also love to fix is that, I'm using gnus-demon-add-handler 'gnus-demon-scan-news to scan for mail every x minutes, which blocks Emacs since, I have gnus open all the time, but knowing that some emails I could get are critical I do need it all the day, aside that I would be working and, having some mini blocks is annoying.
 ​
 Thank you, I would love to hear if anyone uses Gnus extensively!.

 TLDR. Gnus Configurations and improvements

When I initially connect to a server over tramp, then attempt to open up a local file the host and username are always prepended to the file path and I can't delete them. For example the file path will look like
 Find-file: /ssh:host: path/to/file
 and the furthest I can go back is
 Find-file:/ssh:host:
 I've attempted to type in ~ and // as suggested in another reddit post, however, this just takes me back to the home directory on the remote.
 Is there any way to remove the host info from the beginning of the file path?
 ​
 Edit: The issue seems to be with ivy and the way it alters the "completing-read-function" as mentioned here https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/45929/disable-ivy-for-find-file , this is enough of a reason for me to try vertico instead.

 SUMMARY for test run started at Tue Dec 5 18:26:56 2023 1:31:28.360659 spent to go through 9836 total tests, which gave rise to 48054 test cases, of which 38037 were skipped 0 had missing libraries 9880 expected passes 106 expected failures 0 caused framework failures 0 caused framework warnings 0 unexpected passes 2 unexpected failures 0 unexpected stat failures 29 fragile tests Unexpected failures: /tmp/ghctest-i15kidsy/test spaces/libraries/ghc-compact/tests/T16992.run T16992 [bad exit code (137)] (compacting_gc) /tmp/ghctest-i15kidsy/test spaces/libraries/ghc-compact/tests/T16992.run T16992 [bad exit code (137)] (normal) Appending 242 stats to file: build_results.txt user error (tests failed) Build failed. 
 Quite frankly I am a bit stumped. First, on why so many test cases were skipped. Second, I have absolutely no idea what could be causing this error or how to fix it. Have any of you had trouble getting GHC running and have encountered something similar? I am using ghc-9.4.7. 
 Some additional information from running the failing tests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Reddit,
 I'm encountering an issue with my Haskell project where modules placed in subdirectories aren't being recognized during the build process. Here's a glimpse of my project's structure:
 src/ ├── Lib.hs ├── Lib2.hs ├── Lib3.hs ├── source │ └── SourceLib5.hs 
 The specific problem arises with SourceLib5.hs located in the source subdirectory. When I attempt to build the project using the following command:
 rm hask-tracer2.cabal && stack clean && stack build --test 
 I receive an error indicating that SourceLib5 cannot be found:
 [Error Output] /home/dewi/code/hask_tacer/hask-tracer2/test/Dewi5Spec.hs:11:1: error: Could not find module ‘SourceLib5’ Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. 
 This error occurs despite the attempt to import SourceLib5 in Dewi5Spec.hs
 import SourceLib5 (getMiddle) 
 Further investigation revealed that SourceLib5 is not listed in the generated hask-tracer2.cabal file:
 exposed-modules: Lib Lib2 Lib3 other-modules: 
 Could anyone help me understand why the module in the subdirectory is not being included in the build and how to resolve this issue? For reference, you can find the project on GitHub: hask-tracer2 (sub-dir-test branch).
 Thank you in advance for your insights!

I have the issue when in editing mode at the end of a line if autocorrect disagrees with the word and I press enter to go to the next line then it selects the first autocorrect suggestion. Not ideal, anyone have a quick solution? Im also a noob so it may be as simple as making me aware of a different keybinding to add another line while in editing mode.

 I am storing some information about Emacs files in a database and when the a file name is selected in the application, I want an specific Emacs instance to open the file in a chosen frame and window. 
 The Emacs instance could communicate with the app about its state and the app would send the commands to windows.
 The application could be a native application or a web page.
 Are there some functions which can get a file to open in a particular window and a particular frame on some specific instance of Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I get the feeling that learning Elisp as your first Lisp doesn't help with learning Lisp or is even helpful with Emacs itself because the focus of Emacs is too narrow, as though fixating on use-package and other editor configuration code isn't bad enough.
 e.g. when it comes to UIs text prompt and some other wierd font-locking stuff is the usual way, whereas with other Lisps you would be working on a wide variety of GUI and TUI interfaces and other libraries.
 Do those with an experience of other Lisps in feel this way, although learning Lisp may have involved learning Emacs as well because it is the go to Lisp development environment?
 I have seen a number of general Lisp tutorials I want t try, eg https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/w37hyj/video_kavehs_common_lisp_lesson_01/

For which Applicative do the expressions pure x <* pure y and pure x <|> pure y produce different results?
  
a. Maybe
 b. []
 c. Validation
 b is the correct answer but I don't understand why. Validation is a type that's defined in the course, but we can ignore it for this question, and consider options a and b only.

 Let's say I start hyperdrive gateway on one machine from within Emacs; if I'm using another machine to connect to that specific hyperdrive, I can only do it read-only (the file is opened in a read-only buffer). Can I have full access to the shared files, from all the machines connected to it? Can I designate, in some way, which clients can have full control?
 Another question would be if it's possible to start a hyperdrive gateway on a Linux system, with no Emacs installed on it, and use Emacs-es on various other machines to connect to that node, also having full control over the files, for all (hand-picked) clients?

 Recently I wanted to get back to Emacs, and as with any text editor I use, installed the Gruvbox theme.
 The problem is that even though the colors are the same, different types of keywords are colored differently which bothers me deeply. Is there an easy way to configure it to the way I'm more used to? Aside from the rainbow brackets which are fine and unconnected to my knowledge.
 Also tried doom-gruvbox bundled with Doom Emacs, and it looked even worse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using org-roam to keep my notes, which generally works well for me. There's one thing I am missing and I'm wondering if I just overlooked it, or whether it simply doesn't exist.
 I regularly paste text from other sources (e.g. a bit of Wikipedia text for a stub note, or highlighted text from a PDF via org-noter) into my notes and what I am looking for is a way to find/indicate existing org-roam entries in those pieces of text.
 For example, if I have existing org-roam entries for genetic variants and LD, then if I copy a piece of text like
  
Genetic variants that are in LD need to be pruned
  
into a new node, I would like to have some way to highlight/find/link these two potential org-roam links. This doesn't need to happen automagically. Manually calling a function that parses the new node would also be fine.
 So this is basically some sort of "unlinked references", but the other way around. When I manually type text into my nodes, completion does its work, but for pasted text, that is (understandably) not the case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought a new compact "75%" "gaming" keyboard and it turns out it is a US layout keyboard, if that is what it really is. It has lights on all the keys and it doesn't even have Caps Lock and Num Lock indicators as all the keys are lit. If there is a way to indicate the status of the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys I'm yet to discover it.
 There are other similar types whose light patterns programmable, but on this one they appear to be permamently lit.
 It seems that the keyboard vendors charge a hefty premium for a "gaming" keyboard with a UK layout, and my view is that if I have to reprogram the keyboard whether UK or US then I might as well stick to the cheaper US one and reprogram it.
 I got this one for all of £7.99 in baby pink because I could use the color therapy and I love the tactile feedback. I'm not sure how it will last though because one of the keys came off easily.
 UK keyboards have a smaller Left-Shift key with the key for \ and | next to it, before the Z, and on this keyboard \ is activated by Alt-Shift - and | is activated by Alt-, below theESC` key.
 I want to use Alt-= for the | key to keep it closer. Currently pressing Alt-= produces nothing until it is pressed again after which it produces ¸, some kind of tiny right-angled character.
 I have read a few guides which are general and are targetted for Linux from bottom up, but I'd prefer something Emacsy if there is one, and if EXWM requires additional consideration.
 PS. I got another even smaller one in baby blue with 61 keys which I also need to program, but that may have to wait, and boy I never had a glimmer of what Emacs pinky could feel like until I tried to use the basic navigation keys which require the Function and Alt keys to activate them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many good Emacs tutorials to help you getting started with Day 1.
 I have used Emacs for years at this point but in a relatively unsophisticated way. I use it basically the same way I would use VSCode or any other editor. I am looking for tutorials on Emacs that will help a user who already knows their way around Emacs to get the most of it, that discusses features which might be overwhelming for a beginner while skipping over basic stuff like navigating around the buffer.
 People always say "Emacs is infinitely customizable!" This is only helpful if you come to Emacs thinking "*My* editor can do X, Y and Z/my editor can't do X, Y and Z, but I want it to. Can Emacs do X, Y and Z?" Then, you can say "Yes, you can write X, Y and Z in elisp." This is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for ideas on ways to improve my workflow using Emacs that I wouldn't have thought of myself.

 I already did some research, but it was unsuccessful so far, so help would be appreciated, even of the kind "it unfortunately does not exist". I am aware of accelerate, but I was hoping that there is a library with the most common LinAlg functions already built in, similar to hmatrix.

 Hopefully either someone finds this useful, or else is inspired by the code to write their own in-house version (which is what I effectively did.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I was having an issue with loading packages with the elpaca package manager that depend on vterm (vterm-toggle & multi-vterm). Loading my configuration from scratch, all the packages get downloaded, however, vterm-toggle and multi-vterm seem to require vterm-module and require it to be compiled. I have to answer yes or no to compile the module, however, from the elpaca-log menu I can't figure out how to give that answer. 
 I know that there is variable "vterm-always-compile-module" that should skip this question, however, it doesn't seem to be working for me. I have tried placing that in multiple different sections of the use-package block, however, confirmation always seems to be required. 
 (use-package vterm :ensure t :commands vterm :custom (vterm-shell "/bin/zsh") :config (main/leader-keys "o T" '(vterm :wk "Vterm"))) (use-package multi-vterm :init (setq vterm-always-compile-module t) :requires vterm ) 
 Here is the relevant part of my config. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Either a way to bypass the compilation question altogether or a way to answer yes on the elpaca-log menu. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to be able to directly query org tables using sqlite src blocks. I want to create an elisp function in my config, which I could use in an src block like...
 #+begin_src sqlite :db ":memory:" :var sqltbl=my/orgtbl-to-sql(tbl=<orgtbl>) SELECT * FROM sqltbl #+end_src 
 My hope would be that the function my/orgtbl-to-sql would basically just run the following SQL code...
 drop table if exists <orgtbl>; .import $<orgtbl> <orgtbl> 
 essentially just importing the named org table as an sql table of the same name.
 Any help on accomplishing this is appreciated. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been experimenting with using GNUS for email. I have several emails configured thus far and seem to have only one strange issue. For example, here is an obfuscated portion of the config:
  (use-package gnus :ensure nil :custom (gnus-select-method '(nnnil nil)) (gnus-summary-exit-hook 'gnus-summary-expire-articles) (gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnimap "mymail" (nnimap-address "mail.mymail.com") (nnimap-server-port "imaps") (nnimap-stream ssl) (nnir-search-engine imap) (nnmail-expiry-target "nnimap+mymail:Trash") (nnmail-expiry-wait immediate))) 
 In particular I want messages to expire immediately and be moved into my Trash folder. When I am inside a group summary, I can manually mark messages as Expired with E. Then I could manually expire them with B e or M-x gnus-summary-expire-articles. When I exit the summary buffer the messages appear in the Trash folder as expected. However I also have the gnus-summary-exit-hook set to call the same function. This configuration is actually unnecessary since that is the default setting. When I just exit the summary buffer, I see Expiring articles...done . . . but they aren't moved to the Trash folder. 
 I am pretty confused by this behavior as I see no difference between the two invocations of gnus-summary-expire-articles. My config is also almost a mirror of most recent GNUS guides/configurations so I feel like I must be missing something simple or everyone else would experience the same behavior.
 Has anyone else had this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs Community!,
 ​
 I'm trying to configure Emacs as an Email client, currently using IMAPS correctly. Issue being that, when I'm trying to send mail with the configured mail, I get asked the SMTP server, even though I have configured it through smtpmail-multi.el.
 I'm using Emacs Doom with Emacs 29.1. And Gnus IMAPS is using the auth-sources configured (maos-keychain-generic) correctly. Reading the smtp Emacs documentation, it apparently can use .authinfo?, which I'm not using but, another way in auth-sources that works when fetching but someone not when sending. This authentication also works when using IRC circe.
 ​
 Here's my configuration:
 (add-to-list 'smtpmail-multi-accounts '(gmail . ("mymail@yes.com" "smtp.gmail.com" 587 "mymail@yes.com" starttls nil nil nil))) (add-to-list 'smtpmail-multi-accounts '(gmail . ("mysecondmail@no.com" "smtp.gmail.com" 587 "mysecondmail@no.com" starttls nil nil nil))) (add-to-list 'smtpmail-multi-associations '("mymail@yes.com" gmail)) (add-to-list 'smtpmail-multi-associations '("mysecondmail@no.com" gmail)) (setq smtpmail-servers-requiring-authorization "\\.com") ;; More Sending configurations (require 'org-mime) (setq org-mime-library 'mml) (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'org-mime-confirm-when-no-multipart) (setq gnus-dribble-ignore t) 
 Also, these mails have each a lot of contacts that I would need for auto complete, or at least get my mails autocompleted. How do you manage contacts?.
 ​
 TLDR. Updated way to use the integrated SMTP send with different mails.

 I don't currently have TODO states for my goals as they are larger projects, but I could add them if required to get them to show up in the agenda. 
 What I'm looking for is some sort of tutorial or guide to how exactly custom agenda functions work.

Laminar says "Easy to understand: no macros", while Kyo emphasizes "Note: defer is currently the only macro in Kyo. All other features use regular language constructs." It seems that using less macros is something library users will like.
 While I understand that macros were a problem in the past (Scala 2), and that using them, even in their present form is not for the faint-hearted. My understanding is that, for the user, that should not be a problem (if the macros/libraries are well written). The black magic that macros can introduce, should make the user's life easier. Do you avoid libraries that use macros? Why?

 So far I've only succeeded by doing the following: - Move my custom elisp to a new file (emacs-lib.el) which starts with (provide 'emacs-lib) - Manually run emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load while visiting that file - Change my init file to load the library:
 (setq elisp-dir "~/config/elisp") (add-to-list 'load-path elisp-dir) (require 'emacs-lib) 
 After restarting Emacs, I've checked that many of my custom functions are indeed native-compiled.
 It would be nice if I could have my init file take care of compiling the library when missing or outdated. Even better if I didn't need the separate file, but that's no big deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an org mode document that consists pretty much entirely of top level headlines with properties.
 So far, I have written a couple functions to grab individual properties and grab all properties, then a wrapper that uses completing-read to let me pick a headline and return all properties. Currently, that wrapper only lets me search by headline, because I'm using completing-read to grab the headline then feeding that headline into my "get-all-properties" function. 
 I've been trying (and failing) to find a way to search by property as well as headline - i.e. If I have headline 'A', 'B', and 'C' with property ':GROUP:' equal to 'test' , and 'D', 'E', and 'F' with ':GROUP:' equal to 'answer', I want to show the list of headlines as usual (A,B,C,D,E,F) but type 'test' into the minibuffer, and narrow the options down to just A B and C. 
 The closest option to this that I found was the 'alt-completing-read' function (defined more here) but that only seems to let you search by the first element in the alist, not the second.
 If anyone knows of a way to achieve this, I'd appreciate any advice, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a cabal project all the modules must be explicitly listed for building in the .cabal. This would usually result in a very long list of modules. Is there a way/work in progress for regex support to efficiently list them? Like say Utils.* which would recursively include all modules?
 If no or if this might be an anti pattern for some reason, how do very large projects manage this efficiently? Do they copy paste the path by hand for literally every single module?
 I have also seen some projects on github like ShellCheck which first make a library, expose all the modules and then simple add that do build-depends of the final executable. Is this the recommended approach than having just one executable and adding all the modules to other-modules:?

 alphapapa, tarsius, and I just released v0.3.0 of hyperdrive.el!
 Prot and I are presenting the new features at EmacsConf tomorrow!
 Highlights of v0.3.0:
  
Added a new interface to hyperdrive-mirror which uses new features from Transient v0.5.0
 Redesigned the *hyperdrive-mirror* buffer to use taxy-magit-section
 Added support for starting and stopping hyper-gateway from within Emacs on machines without systemd
 Add customization options for displaying hyperdrives using format-spec
  
Some more goodies:
  
Basic Embark integration
 find-file-at-point integration
 Support following relative links in hyperdrive markdown files
 Internally, hyperdrive.el now uses shorthands.el
  
For the full set of changes, please check out the hyperdrive.el CHANGELOG.
 By the time the talk airs, v0.3.0 should be available on NonGNU ELPA and MELPA!
 I'm excited to see what other projects folks are working on this Emacs Advent!
 Join us for the second day of EmacsConf!!!

 The problem is now that this seems to interfere with orgmode because in the date-picker that you get when inserting a time-stamp S-<left> is now bound to evil-backward-word-begin and not to the function that moves the date one day back (the same happens for S-<right>. S-<up> and S-<down> work as expected).
 Is there a way to have evil-mode in the minibuffer yet use the usual orgmode keybindings in the date picker?
 Many thanks!

The University hasnt given us any tutorial on how to do it and every youtube video does it very differently, so im really unsure on what i have to do.
 So is there any good tutorial/better way of getting haskell onto my Windows Laptop?
 Any help is appreciated! (Also sorry if my english is weird, its my 3rd language)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's create an Emacs Advent calendar! It would be nice if for every day till Christmas someone takes the opportunity to showcase their Emacs work. It will be interesting to see what you are all working on.
 I'll make a start - at the first of December I finally released stable versions of multiple of my packages. The Consult package provides search commands with live preview. Some of the commands run asynchronously. Consult reached version 1.0, a little more than three years after the first release 0.1 and with 2211 commits in the repository. These are the stable versions I have tagged today:
  
Consult 1.0: Search commands with live preview
 Corfu 1.0: Completion popup for code and text
 Cape 1.0: Completion backends for in-buffer completion
 Tempel 1.0: Template expansion
 Jinx 1.0: Spell checker based on Enchant
 OSM 1.0: OpenStreetMap viewer
 Org-Modern 1.1: Org styling
  
Furthermore I have released new versions of Vertico and Marginalia:
  
Vertico 1.5: Minibuffer Completion UI
 Marginalia 1.4: Minibuffer annotations, co-authored with Omar Antolín Camarena
  
All the packages are available from GNU ELPA and MELPA. I'll refer you to the changelogs for the details regarding the releases. I am happy to hear your feedback. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friend of mine was perusing through her late father-in-law's paper files over Thanksgiving break. She found fascinating research.
 I imagine my kids sifting through my stuff 50 years from now. If it's all in Emacs, they won't be able to sift through ANYTHING, because it's not intuitive, not navigable. You can't click on anything. They would have to learn a few dozen key commands to do ANYTHING. I get that they're just text files, but I don't think my family would know that. Evernote, on the other hand, while proprietary, is stupid simple to navigate. (FWIW I tend to use one big file with all my notes as org-headings. Maybe individual files would be more non-emacs-user friendly?)
 I know it's weird and morbid, but I think about these things. Anyone else? I guess I'm thinking about long-term archival in a digital system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graal Native Image is a technology to compile Java code ahead-of-time to a lightweight native binary executable, which has the advantages of smaller resources, starts in milliseconds, no warmup needed, and reduce attack surface. The serialization in graalvm is tricky and slow since it doesn't support reflection, jit, and bytecode manipulation. Many performance optimization can't be applied in graalvm.
 In Fury 0.4.0 version, Fury can run on GraalVM native image efficiently and is super easy-to-use. Neither reflection nor meta config are needed. Fury generates all code for Fury JIT framework and MethodHandle/LambdaMetafactory at graalvm native image build time. Then use those generated code for serialization at runtime without any extra cost, the performance is great.
 Compared to native JDK serialization, Fury can be 46x faster than JDK, and less than half of the serialized size.
 See https://github.com/alipay/fury/blob/main/docs/guide/graalvm_guide.md for example and benchmarks.
 This is a big step for jvm serialization, please give it a try and share us with your feedbacks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! 👋 I've been pondering the idea of diving into Scala and wanted to reach out to the community for some insights. If you've got experience with Scala or have opinions on it, I'd love to hear from you!
 Why should I learn Scala? What are the pros and cons?
 I've heard that Scala is a powerful and versatile language, but I'm curious about the real-world experiences of those who have used it. What advantages does Scala bring to the table, and are there any drawbacks that one should be aware of?
 Here are a few questions to get the discussion going:
 Pros:
  
What specific features of Scala do you find most beneficial in comparison to other languages, especially Java?
 Have you found Scala to be particularly well-suited for certain types of projects or domains?
 How has Scala's support for functional programming influenced your coding style and project architecture?
  
Cons:
  
Are there challenges or pitfalls you've encountered while working with Scala that newcomers should be aware of?
 How does Scala's learning curve compare to other languages, and what resources would you recommend for someone starting out?
 Are there any specific scenarios or types of projects where Scala might not be the best fit?
  
Feel free to share your experiences, tips, or any resources you think would be helpful for someone considering learning Scala. I'm excited to hear your perspectives! 🚀

 i am starting out with orgmode and would like to be able to see (and ideally sync 2-way) todos and appointments to my android device.
 So far I have looked into syncing calendar entries and have come up with this:
 Etar as calendar app, ICSx⁵ for syncing it with caldav, radicale as caldav server and org-caldav to sync orgmode.
 This setup works but looks ridiculously complex for such a simple use-case and so I wonder if this is really the way to do it.
 So my question is:
 What is your solution to the problem of getting your orgmode-stuff onto your phone? What apps do you use and how do you sync?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/haskell, we are a research team at Monash University, interested in interactive tools for functional programming. For one of our projects, we created a Haskell puzzle game called Zero to Hero. 
 Here, we invite you to explore 10 unique puzzles; each challenges you to implement a seemingly impossible function. The only help you have is a handful of strange-looking helper functions and your own wits. The game starts easy but quickly elevates into total madness. 
 You can choose to participate in the study or play for fun without any data collection at all. No stress. More details are explained on the landing page. 
 I hope you enjoy the game! I will answer any question in this thread.

 I have a large number of org-mode appointments that depend on the date of Easter. They are currently in the form of diary sexp, but I don't really care what form they're in; what I'm really trying to find is a general solution to "When today is X days before Easter, show arbitrary message 'X' in the org agenda. When today is Y days after Easter, show arbitrary message 'Y' in the org agenda." (In all of my cases, Easter means "the Easter within the current calendar year".)
 Emacs elegantly figures out the correct date for Easter, but Emacs also has a hard-coded list of Christian holidays that aren't useful to me. Instead of a new hard-coded list of holidays, I'm looking to make arbitrary and changeable use of the Easter calculation - compared to today - without showing any holidays at all.

 My solution for today:
 ``` calculateSumOfAllCalibrationValues :: String -> Int calculateSumOfAllCalibrationValues x = sum . map parseCalibrationInput $ lines x
 parseCalibrationInput :: String -> Int parseCalibrationInput = read . (\x -> [head x, last x]) . filter isNumber
 calculateSumOfAllCalibrationValues' :: String -> Int calculateSumOfAllCalibrationValues' x = sum . fmap (parseCalibrationInput . parseSpelledOutDigits) $ lines x
 parseSpelledOutDigits :: String -> String parseSpelledOutDigits x = foldr ((x, y) acc -> replace x y acc) x [ ("one", "1"), ("two", "2"), ("three", "3"), ("four", "4"), ("five", "5"), ("six", "6"), ("seven", "7"), ("eight", "8"), ("nine", "9") ]
 replace :: String -> String -> String -> String replace original new whole@(x : y : xs) = if original isPrefixOf whole then replace original new (x : new <> xs) else x : replace original new (y : xs)
 replace _ _ [x] = [x] replace _ _ [] = []

 I've been using neovim for awhile but have been increasingly frustrated with not being able to understand how things work when they break down. Hoping to learn emacs for fun and maybe to even replace/improve my nvim workflows.
 Things went well at first. I followed the tutorial and got used to some basic navigation as well as window and buffer navigation. I LOVE being able to `C-h` for functions, keys, and variables.
 I decided it was time to start trying to configure things and installing packages. I'm not patient enough to watch 10 hours of system crafters videos and didn't really want to buy Mastering Emacs, so I decided to do some googling…]]></summary>

I started to learn vanilla Emacs (and Elisp) week ago, and write simple notes in Emacs, the majority of my note taking is still done in Obsidian however. One feature I miss is a sidebar outlining the contents of the current file. I tend to have very big files and the sidebar makes it easy to navigate it.
 ![Like this sidebar on the right](https://i.imgur.com/uUSh5XR.png). I didn't find the solution for this yet. I don't aim to replicate my Obsidian setup fully, but I wonder if there is a plugin to this. Or maybe another alternative to navigating big org files.

 My goal: 
 Use Orgmode to customise my emacs and init files while using the Dropbox directory. I would also like to use a custom named init file so it's like eckoinit.el instead of init.el (For easier recognition and modification).
 Overall, I'd like to sync and use emacs from different computers using the same configs.
 I know one of my current snags is I can't remember how to tell emacs from Orgmode to use a differently named init file. I feel like this should be an obvious answer that I should have found by now and I feel silly. 
 Thanks for your time!

Is there a VSCode addon that would just perform a predefined Haskell GHC compilation task (like Microsoft's C/C++ addon does). I don't need any other properties. So far I've just been manually compiling (command line) but it would be easier to avoid jumping into the console every time I want to compile.
 I won't be installing anything on this computer so please do not talk about anything else than just the GHC task.

 This is my first post every on reddit I hope I don't get RTFM ed.
 Problem: Until about a week ago I used to use a doom emacs config I got off of the internet with some modifications just for references in latex. this week I finally decided to code my own literate gnu emacs config but there is one feature I am sorely missing. In the image attached in a org-mode document there is syntax highliting for latex code outside of src_code blocks I want that but I don't know how to get it into my new config. Further information can be provided on request.

 First exercise:
  
Using a state of type [(a,Int)] we can keep track of the numbers of occurrences of elements of type a. For instance [('a',1),('x',3)] means that we've seen one 'a' and three 'x's. 
 Implement a State monad operation count that registers the occurrence of the given value. 
 That is, the operation count x should fetch the pair (x,n) from the state, and replace it with the pair (x,n+1). If no such pair is found, the operation should add (x,1) to the state.
  
Examples:
  runState (count True) [] ==> ((),[(True,1)]) runState (count 7) [] ==> ((),[(7,1)]) runState (count 'a') [('a',1),('b',3)] ==> ((),[('a',2)…]]></summary>

 I am struggling like crazy trying to understand this piece of code. 
 do word <- ["Blue", "Green"] number <- [1,2,3] return (word ++ show number) ==> ["Blue1","Blue2","Blue3","Green1","Green2","Green3"] 
 What is going on here? The result looks like a nested for loop, but I don't get how is it possible? I know the do notation is syntactic sugar, but somehow for IO operations it makes much more sense to me that for lists... 
 I am a total beginner in Haskell, so sorry if this is a very silly question.

 ​
 I'm a long time Emacs user, right now using the Doom framework and, I recently took a look at the power Nix, specifically the devenv.sh project. I wonder if someone is using it in some manner. As it being quite powerful and allowing having separate development environments. 
 ​
 Are there any packages for this?, and if not, how complicated would it to be to for example, once entering a project, Emacs gets all of its PATHs (languages like NodeJS and other niceties) so that little by little, the project can be replicated and used completely with devenv and Emacs without having to installing anything globally.
 ​
 Thank you, I would love to hear your workflows!, just wanting to be sure I'm getting the best of the best in my environment, I will be coding in Javascript, Angular and so on.

Whats up with that? Is it shenanigans involving using Int instead of Integer?

 From what I learned we get the above error when a function get a nil value while expecting a string but I don't understand why the function will get a nil value when i selected the correct executable with appropriate compiler flags.
 I would appreciate any help in the matter.

 I created a template for AoC targeting beginners who want to jump straight to coding and don't want to mess with cabal / stack / dependencies / exectuables ... It main features are:
  
A sensible set of “light” dependencies for AoC (It could be lighter though).
 A very simple bash command-line interface (CLI) which erase the usage of cabal: 
 Create Haskell executable files for each new Advent of Code day.
 Run solutions for each day with ease.
 Automatically manage Cabal files, reducing setup hassles.
 
 VSCode tasks for seamless interaction with the CLI. Press CTRL+Shift+P to open the command panel and type “run task” to see all available tasks.
  
It follows some different approaches than other templates. Mainly
  
each day is a single self-contained executable instead of modules
 you don't have to touch cabal file If you don't want to
 has built-in integration with VSCode, via tasks
 Has more dependencies
  
None of the above guarantees a better experience
 VSCode integration
 This is how vscode task look like:

I used it for a long time (and I'm still using it in the evenings), but I'm not totally happy with it. I'd like to spend a little more time on it, changing some colors, updating the slightly outdated screenshots in the readme and so on. While I'm at it, I could have a look at packages that don't work well with it as well. I have some other ideas for themes, and an improved naga would also give me a better base to work from for these.
 I'd be glad if some of you could maybe test-drive it and give me feedback, especially if it perhaps breaks or looks plain bad with some packages you use.
 The main idea of the theme was to get a "more modern retro green" theme, with high contrast, but a non-standard foreground color -- green in this case.
 Thanks in advance!

In other applications fullscreen omits the entire top height of the notch, but for some reason Emacs fullscreen isn't like other native fullscreen - the Emacs frame occupies the entire screen but is still in the Desktop space. So I lose words in the middle of the top line. How can I avoid this situation? I don't see a ns-use-native-fullscreen variable (or any variables containing the words "ns", "native", or "fullscreen" that are useful).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello emacs and Lisp enthusiasts,
 I remember seeing an article that talked about the superfluity of parenthesis in Lisp code, and how non-Lisp programmers were overwhelmed by them, but Lisp programmers had trained their eyes to look at indentation structure and didn't see the parenthesis, and it showed an image of Lisp code without and with the parenthesis faded. I don't have a link to the article, but even as a slightly seasoned Lisper I thought the fainter parenthesis improved readability. 
 So I'm wondering if/how it's possible to achieve this effect in emacs. Is there already a minor-mode for it? Would it involve a font-lock/face for parenthesis? I've tried to navigate the syntax highlighting code before and was a bit turned off by the apparent complexity, so any form of introduction would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ultra-scroll-mac: scroll like lightning
 Emacs-mac is a beautiful port, and was the first to offer pixel-precise smooth scrolling nearly a decade ago. But with modern high-resolution trackpads and high density displays, I found its scrolling handlers just couldn't keep up. On large, full-screen buffers in a heavy mode, trackpad scrolling verged on painful, and, maddeningly, was much worse in one direction than the other. And no wonder: modern trackpads deliver scroll events >50⨉ per second! The other key problem with all known smooth scrolling packages is they tend to stutter and loop back as you try to scroll across images taller than the window.
 This package solves both of these problems:
  
Scrolling performance has been increased 25-50⨉ — you move your fingers, the page responds, instantly.
 Large image handling has been worked around so you can scroll right across them without any hiccups.
 As a bonus, dumb mice get pretty good smooth(-ish) scrolling too.
  
I'll be contributing the core scrolling functions upstream, so hopefully pixel-precision-scroll-mode (which inspired this package, and is recommended on other builds) can make use of some of these improvements in the future.
 Finally, this was all (to me) surprisingly hard to achieve, which you can read all about if you are a glutton.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a Haskell course that has the following question.
 ​
  
Below you'll find a type Result that works a bit like Maybe, but there are two different types of "Nothings": one with and one without an error description. 
 Implement the instance Functor Result
  
data Result a = MkResult a | NoResult | Failure String deriving (Show) 
 My solution:
 instance Functor Result where fmap f (MkResult x) = MkResult (f x) fmap _ NoResult = NoResult fmap _ (Failure desc) = Failure desc 
 Notice that NoResult and Failure are both passthrough, but replacing those with fmap _ x = x produces the following compilation error.
  • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘b’ Expected: Result b Actual: Result a ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: fmap :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> Result a -> Result b at Set12.hs:57:3-6 ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: fmap :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> Result a -> Result b at Set12.hs:57:3-6 • In the expression: x In an equation for ‘fmap’: fmap _ x = x In the instance declaration for ‘Functor Result’ • Relevant bindings include x :: Result a (bound at Set12.hs:58:10) fmap :: (a -> b) -> Result a -> Result b (bound at Set12.hs:57:3) | 58 | fmap _ x = x | ^ 
 Is there a way to avoid the boilerplate pattern matching?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just playing around with Haskell and there are a few things I couldn't understand about the syntax rules of let and do blocks.
 Consider the following code:
 listings = [x | i <- [0..10], let x = i * i, x > 20] -- [25,36,49,64,81,100] 
 I was thinking instead of using this sugar, why not use a do block, which is a more common sugar. So I came up with this, following this:
 listing = do i <- [0..10] let x = i * i guard (x > 20) return x 
 I actually prefer removing the do sugar as well, like this:
 listing = [0..10] >>= (\i -> let x = i * i in guard (x > 20) >> return x) 
 This got me thinking, can I use do so that I can avoid >>= and >>, but also keep it a one liner. So I followed this, this and this and got the following to work:
 listing = do {i <- [0..10]; let {x = i * i} in do guard (x > 20); return x} 
 But I was hoping for something like this, which did not work:
 listing = do {i <- [0..10]; let x = i * i; guard (x > 20); return x} 
 I am not really sure why. But I figured it might be because of let. I tried to get rid of it but I wasn't able to, unless I just remove all sugar and have something like this:
 listing = [0..10] >>= (\i -> (\x -> guard (x > 20) >> return x) (i * i)) 
 Which is, funnily enough, shorted then the do version. Long story short, I don't understand the rules of do and let. Can someone explain in simple terms? By the way, is let also sugar, it doesn't seem like it to me, because my lambda seems to make a dependency on the ordering of variables, but I'm not sure. I didn't consider using where so I'm not sure of it's behavior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 as nvim-user I am just starting out with orgmode and want to use emacs on 4 systems: 2 linux-boxes and 2 android-systems.
 The linux-boxes run emacs 29, on android (in a termux/proot environment) the emacs version currently is 27.
 I am using emacs only for orgmode with evil-mode and the modus-themes.
 What I want is to have the same environment on all machines and so this is my plan:
 I will use syncthing to sync all my org-files as well as the init.el between all machines and in the init.el I will only load packages with use-package.
 So the idea is that when I e.g. introduce a new package on one machine, the new config is synced to the other machines and when I start emacs there the package is installed automatically - everything stays in sync.
 My question: Would that work in practice or are there pitfalls I am not aware of?

 The book was written for Scala 2, so it can be cumbersome to translate it page by page to a newer syntax, and I wanted to ask:
 Is there any book that gives you introduction to up-to-date language features as much as giving you full overview of language as in "Programming in Scala"?

 every time I try to get into orgmode (which is great) I have to deal with emacs (I ususally use nvim) and I feel that regardless of any productivity boost orgmode may give me, I will never recover the time I have wasted with emacs configuration issues - it seems to be just a very, very fragile ecosystem...
 Here is the latest problem:
 I want to use the modus-operandi theme and have added a use-package clause copied from the documentation.
 But now when I open emacs I get a prompt, informing me that loading a theme can run lisp code and if I wanted to proceed, I say yes, I am asked if this theme should be deemed safe for future sessions, I say yes and then the theme loads fine - but only for this sesssion.
 When I close emacs the whole thing starts again, so my question is: How can I get rid of this annoying prompt?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr I'm a noob using DooM and it seems I don't understand variables
 Firstly; please forgive the gratuitous image of my RGB Steamdeck / Corne / DOOM Emacs "coffee shop" setup - I'm just enjoying it at the mo, and have a burning desire to share.
 After a quick play with Zone I'm trying to setup zone-matrix as my "screensaver"
 I did the following:
  
Pulled the files from zone-matrix githib to .emacs.d/zone/
 Added the following to my in my config.el. I realised I was comitting heresy for copying another person's config (from a stackexchange answer) and braced myself for errors; 
  
``` (defun tabbar-mode () (lambda (x) (message "%s"))) (add-to-list 'load-path (concat dotfiles-dir "zone")) (require 'zone-matrix) (require 'zone-matrix-settings) (require 'zone-settings)
 (setq zone-programs [zone-matrix]) (zone-when-idle 60) ```
 After a doom sync I get an (to be honest expected) error void-variable dotfiles-dir.
 The issue I have is with the definition dotfiles-dir - I clearly don't have that variable set, and wonder which of the following is the least-worst approach:
  
Because I'm on DooM there is probably already a similar variable set linking to .config/doom/ am I better putting the zone directory in there? If so, do I hard-code the path in the line containing dotfiles-dir?
 
Should I define a dotfiles-dir or zone-matrix-dir instead? I assume that flies in the face of dotfile conventions?
 
 I'd love to hear your thoughts

 I've been importing csv files as tables and one of the columns stores links but they're quite long and making things awkward looking so I'd like to replace them with some shorthand.
 Sorry, probably a noob question, still new.

 https://git.sr.ht/~sebasmonia/emacs-utils
 Story below:
 I've had versions of a piece of code to pull info from JIRA, in private repos associated with different jobs, for years now.
 When I started my current gig I realized I should put that code in a public place, and maybe someone would write a "proper" JIRA package out of it. If anything, this lets you read details and comments (doesn't do inline images nor attachments). I find it useful in its current state and maybe some of you will too. 
 And last weekend I wrote a Confluence reader. After being BEYOND ANNOYED that you can't read pages without JS.I remember the old (and good) versions of Confluence that didn't force the fancy editor down your throat and you could write everything in wiki markup...anyway.
 The reader detects when a link isn't external, so it doesn't send you to EWW. It doesn't work in 100% of the cases, will probably revisit that code. 
 Oh and both JIRA and Confluence support Emacs' bookmarks, thank to EWW's implementation and our beloved editor being open in the truest sense of the word.

 When I'm viewing an email in emacs, I sometimes want to be able to find it in outlook, maybe I want to reply using outlook or maybe it would look better in outlook.
 Previously I would copy the message-id of the email with emacs, then use a VBA function in outlook to find and open the same email in outlook, which works fine, but it's a bit slow and convoluted.
 Then I found out recently instead of doing that, I could just copy the maildir file as an .eml file and use outlook to open it(here it is necessary to change the line ending to CRLF).
 Maybe I'm just stating the obvious here :)

 I try to use org-modern together with org-indent and the modus-operandi theme.
 Tables seem to work fine when org-indent is off, but when I turn it on the "beautified" tables somehow acquire an extra empty row below every horizontal line.
 Is there anything I could try to make these two packages play nicely together?
 Many thanks!

 My best guess is that these refer to colour depths, but I'm feeling a bit out of my depth here (hah!). My questions are as follows:
  
How does Emacs decide which colour/depth to use?
 Are these fields all required, or are they customary/nice to have?
 Why are some colours hexes and others strings? Do the strings refer to some table somewhere with more hexes?
  
I would be extremely grateful for any clarity and/or links to relevant documentation where I can learn more!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 at my alma mater we are holding a course on Haskell for the students, and one of the initiatives as part of that course is that students can optionally participate in solving Advent Of Code in Haskell, where they can discuss on our Discord how they solved the tasks, ask for help, and learn together, with other students but also with us teachers. It is a way to get them a bit more excited about Haskell and give them a taste of how Haskell fares on a competition like this.
 In order to make it easier for them to get going with it, and to save them from pitfalls of setting up a project in Cabal, I created this template github repo: https://github.com/Martinsos/aoc-2023-haskell-template .
 I am sharing it here in case anybody has some feedback on how it can be improved, and maybe it also helps somebody else here to get started with AoC in Haskell!
 Regarding improvement advice: keep in mind that we want to keep it simple for relative newcomers to Haskell (so no Nix :D!).

 Are there any generally recommended approaches for React development with Emacs? Language server, minor modes, tree-sitter, etc? There seem to be a lot of options and modes available.
 The codebase is currently JavaScript and JSX, but I'm considering Typescript and TSX down the line. Should I just default to the TypeScript tooling?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, sometimes I try something new to compare with already used packages, this weekend I wanted to try Eglot, however, I ran into a number of problems. One of them is autocomplete.
 For example, when I write in vue, I want to autocomplete a watch function. This function is available in the following packages
 import { watch } from 'vue'; import { watch } from 'fs'; import { watch } from 'fs/promises' ... etc 
 But when I use autocomplete in eglot I only see the first candidate - importing from the fs package. Is there any possibility or workaround to display all possible candidates?
 Example of autocomplete with eglot
 https://preview.redd.it/tlgtg5imw43c1.jpg?width=2930&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f0cd2ff1b6733ec26021b77b6e5e392f26921df
 Example of autocomplete with lsp-mode

 ​
 I also know that lsp-mode in conjunction with corfu has a similar problem, but it is impossible to solve it there as the authors of both packages think that the problem is not on their side 😅 Is the situation with eglot the same?

What is the difference between cabal install <package> vs adding package name to .cabal and then cabal run/build?
 Where are cabal package dependencies for a project installed (after cabal init)? Couldn't find them in the current directory. I read it can be found in ~/.cabal/packages, but then if they are installed in a common location, how does it manage versions across them? Does it install for every version and use as required for a project? Why not a node-modules like structure?
 Does cabal install behave differently depending on whether .cabal is present in the current directory or not?
 What if after adding a package .cabal, I decided to change my mind and remove it. In the next cabal run/build, will the package be uninstalled from wherever it was stored?
  
Thanks.

 This Doom Emacs install is on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS, and I have also tried Ubuntu 23.10.1 (Mantic Minotaur) and still the same error.
 This is my org-roam configuration:
 (use-package! org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory "~/RoamNotes") (org-roam-completion-everywhere t) (org-roam-dailies-capture-templates '(("d" "default" entry "* %<%I:%M %p>: %?" :if-new (file+head "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n")))) :bind (("C-c n l" . org-roam-buffer-toggle) ("C-c n f" . org-roam-node-find) ("C-c n i" . org-roam-node-insert) :map org-mode-map ("C-M-i" . completion-at-point) :map org-roam-dailies-map ("Y" . org-roam-dailies-capture-yesterday) ("T" . org-roam-dailies-capture-tomorrow)) :bind-keymap ("C-c n d" . org-roam-dailies-map) :config (require 'org-roam-dailies) ;; Ensure the keymap is available (org-roam-db-autosync-mode)) 
 This is the backtrace of the error:
  set-buffer(#<killed buffer>) (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (org-reveal '(4))) (closure ((buf . #<killed buffer>)) nil (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (org-reveal '(4))))() apply((closure ((buf . #<killed buffer>)) nil (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (org-reveal '(4)))) nil) timer-event-handler([t 25958 838 237811 nil (closure ((buf . #<killed buffer>)) nil (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (org-reveal '(4)))) nil nil 85000 nil]) 
 I have tried the following:
  
Delete the org-roam-db and then run org-roam-db-sync.
 Going into emacsql directory >> sqlite and running make.
  
Thank you all in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example, let's say I were to change backward-delete-char-untabify-method for prog-mode buffers. Naively, I'd write something like,
 (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local backward-delete-char-untabify-method 'hungry))) 
 but the documentation recommends against using lambdas in add-hook calls (which makes sense). I can, of course, just make a named function instead of a lambda and pass that to add-hooks. But, rather than do that, is there any other option for setting variables automatically for modes besides a hook like this?
 Also, as a bonus question, if I wanted to also do something like enable show-paren-mode for all prog-mode buffers, which of the following do you consider "better" (assume that this is not something that is likely to change frequently):
 ;; option 1 (defun my-prog-mode-settings () (setq-local backward-delete-char-untabify-method 'hungry)) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'my-prog-mode-settings) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'show-paren-mode) ;; option 2 (defun my-prog-mode-settings () (setq-local backward-delete-char-untabify-method 'hungry) (show-paren-mode)) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'my-prog-mode-settings) 
 Obviously, I realize that it's not really important, but I feel like bike-shedding this morning.

I have never done anything in lisp before and still struggle to understand how single quotes signify a function or what ever.
 With that said, i was also planning on doing AoC this year. Originally i wanted to look into zig or go, but now think that this might be the opportunity to dive into lisp for a bit.
 But with knowing basically nothing: Is this even "viable", or advisable? Should i be looking at common lisp instead? Or would you say that's a pretty dumb idea and i should rather learn it in a different way?

 The ways I've found:
  
Console. An easy way, I've implemented it, but it's too simple. I want graphics.
 
GUI app. Yes, that's what I need. But, I find writing GUIs in Haskell very boring. Also, the user should download and launch an application, which I don't really like
 
 Web-based ways:
  
Web server and application in Haskell. Yes! There are frameworks. But I need a free hosting for Haskell applications. Which, currently, I haven't found.
 
(Haskell code -> JS library) + NodeJS. Perfect. I have no problem that the computation is performed at user side. Currently exploring this way. (And I can't use PureScript)

I’ve developed a new library to filter local files in Nix

This post requires some familiarity with Nix and its language.
So if you don’t know what Nix is yet,
take a look first,
it’s pretty neat.
In this post we’re going to look at what source filtering is,
why it’s useful,
why a new library was needed for it,
and the basics of the new library.
This post notably won’t really teach you a lot about the new library,
that’s what the official tutorial
and the reference documentation is for.
But if you’d like to know some background and motivation, please read on!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! :)
 Im quite new so please excuse my ignorance.Im currently running doom emacs, and REALLY love it, but i have a few problems which im trying to tackle one at a time.
 The current problem i have is that when i mark a TODO as "DONE", it still shows up in org agenda weekly schedule view. I did some googling, and have currently tried this:
 (setq org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t) (setq org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t) (setq org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-done t) (setq org-agenda-skip-function-global '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done)) 
 None of these options have helped me so far :/
 Worth to point out is that Im using custom labels in doom emacs, so ill paste them here as well, just to double check that the issue isnt there:
  (setq org-todo-keywords ; This overwrites the default Doom org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO(t)" ; A task that is ready to be tackled "ASMT(a)" ; Assignment "EXAM(e)" ; Exam "PRESNT(p)" ; Presentation "MAIL(m)" ; Mail "MEET(M)" ; Meeting "IDEA(i)" ; Ideas to be done "PROJ(P)" ; A project that contains other tasks "CHORES(c)" ; Chores that needs to be done "LEISURE(l)" ; Leisure / Hobby stuff "APPOINTMENT(A)" ; Scheduled appointments "REMINDER(r)" ; Reminder "WAIT(w)" ; Something is holding up this task "|(k)" ; The pipe necessary to separate "active" states and "inactive" states "DONE(d)" ; Task has been completed "CANCELLED(c)" ) ; Task has been cancelled (sequence "[ ](T)" "[-](S)" "[?](W)" "[X](D)" ) (sequence "OKAY(o)" "YES(y)" "NO(n)" )) org-todo-keyword-faces '( ("TODO" .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 So I know if emacs is lagging I should run the profiler for a bit while it's lagging and then review the report. However, I'm not sure what to do next. 
 It looks clear that company / completion is responsible for the laggy behavior here, especially a jsonrpc-request made by completion. That makes sense, there's a slow network call somewhere in the works that's gumming things up.
 I'm using eglot for lsp and would expect that would be the source of a slow jsonrpc call, maybe eglot trying to get completion candidates on every keystroke through the LSP server? But I don't understand the stack here well enough to know how to proceed in debugging or fixing things.
 Would love any help. Knowing what to fix is great - but also I'm really interested in knowing how to know what to do next in general in this scenario.
 Thanks!

This is an idea I've been experimenting with for a few years, and I'm happy to finally release it! I've used this approach on multiple professional projects, and it is currently being used at the National Solar Observatory. It combines the best ideas of Tailwindcss and Elm-UI with Haskell.
  
Github
 Hackage
  
​
 myPage = col (gap 10) $ do el (bold . fontSize 32) "My page" button (border 1) "Click Me" 
 Instead of relying on CSS's poor programming features, we can use normal Haskell functions to factor and reuse our app's styles
 header = bold h1 = header . fontSize 32 h2 = header . fontSize 24 page = gap 10 myPage = col page $ do el h1 "My Page" ... 
 It has more features, including
  
Intuitive Layouts with `row`, `col`, `grow` and `space`
 Embedded page-specific CSS
 Stateful styles (like hover) and responsive designs
  
Any and all questions or feedback welcome! The reasoning behind using utility classes for CSS is explained well here. Also, stay tuned in the coming weeks for the upcoming release of Hyperbole, a server-only interactive web-framework that leverages this library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often want a block of quoted text at the top of something I'm writing, but I find the #+BEGIN_QUOTE: markup somewhat obtrusive. Does anyone have a trick or a package that you use to remove the visible #+Begin and #+END markup and maybe add italics and even a left-side bar to the quote as an alternative visual cue? Though I live in Emacs, sometimes I miss the kind of simplicity that a web-based editor or a messenger like Slack could provide. Thank you!

 http://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_functions
 I see this as problematic, because whether a function is partial is mostly a question of type. But to ensure valid values for a specific type, for example all numbers from zero to 2^16 - 1 (unsigned 16-bit integer) or "Natural" as a subset of Haskell's "Integer", you need a smart constructor that produces an error message for incorrect number arguments; a function that behaves partially relative to the values of an original type such as "Integer". Would it be practical here to always work with an optional type, Haskell's "Maybe"? I don't think so! Because that would result in almost all types being "maybe" and the code be littered with unnecessary pattern matching.

 Scenario:
 I'm sitting in dired and want to rename a file. How does one do that again...? I know I've made notes on this before, but I can't remember which file in which folder. I remember I tagged it with :dired:, though.
 What would be the fastest way to search for this? Is there a way to do a search like rename tag=dired, or similar, in a folder w/subfolders, across all my org-mode notes?
 I should also mention that I really don't want to install any extra packages for this.

 Thing is, this does not happen when I'm on the vpn for work!
 My two other computers at home experience the exact same issue. These two don't have any vpn software installed, just plain debian. The computer with the vpn is a Windows 10 with WSL2 running debian as well. I use cntlm when on the vpn and I set my proxy accordingly. On my plain debian home boxes I don't use any proxy. I use the same .emacs file on all three machines.
 Was it a debian apt-get update that did this to me? I have no idea. Anyone here with a similar issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I thought I was being very clever by creating a virtual machine build environment so I didn't have to litter my main computer with 100s of packages to build emacs. So I built it in a gnomebox and set the prefix to $home/.local/opt/emacs as I saw someone do. It runs fine in the virtual machine
 The issue is now, I'd like to move the install or the built files to my host machine and run it, but it won't run. If I just try to move the $home/.local/opt/emacs folder to my own computer, and run it I get the following:
 ./emacs-29.1.90: error while loading shared libraries: libgpm.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 When I try to move the whole directory (source code and the build directories inside there) out of the virtual machine into the Host and try to run make install (this is after make and compilation completed) it says 
 make install if [ -x ./config.status ]; then \ ./config.status --recheck; \ else \ ../configure --cache-file=/dev/null; \ fi /bin/sh: line 4: ../configure: Permission denied make: *** [Makefile:573: config.status] Error 126 
 I have tried to chown -R <myusername>:<mygroup> ./ to the whole directory but it still gives me the permission denied.
 Any ideas how I might accomplish this task?
 Thanks!

 Capture text from Safari into your inbox.

 A simple hack to right click on selected text and capture it (with URL if this is Safari) to your OrgMode Inbox.
 I hope someone else will find this useful.
 This works pretty much in all apps on macOS (e.g. Mail)
 The hack is composed of workflow for Automator and a small Python script (that might need some adjustment for your case)

 "stack ghci .\Factors.hs" can correctly load it.
 I install package by: stack install parallel
 It is so confusing, I configure the dev environment for hours, still not working.
 I uninstall and install GHCup already, I have no idea how to install Haskell and parallel package correctly.
 my WSL ubuntu is also broken, by removing stack.yaml will make the error disappear but still has the same problem that cannot recongnize parallel package.

 Now, I want to setup a correct dev environment.
 Looks like vscode or hsl extension don't knokw the stack package.
 How to make stack package can be found by vscode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently had a situation where I wanted all maximal elements of a list. Base has maximum but that just gives a single element. A maximal function that gives all maximal elements would be a straight forward generalization with the added benefit that it’s defined for the empty list. Then one could just have
 maximum = head . maximal 
 On Hoogle I couldn’t find something like this. Neither in base nor any package. 
 Very often when I think "why is this not in base?" it turns out that there actually is something and what I wanted is just a special case. Or you can trivially compose it out of other functions. Does this apply here?
 I also noticed, when I tried to define maximal for Foldable instead of lists, I did not know how to do it without specializing the return type (ie list). Is that possible? And if not, is that maybe the problem why it’s not in base?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts,
 I'm reaching out to see if there's anyone here who's successfully integrated a modern development environment within Emacs for Python programming. Specifically, I'm interested in a setup that incorporates eglot, tree-sitter and company.
 I've encountered a significant issue: whenever I enable python-ts-mode, Emacs consumes all my system's memory and crashes. While I've managed to use a more basic setup that limits tree-sitter to syntax highlighting only, I can't shake the feeling that I'm missing out on some great functionality.
 To help with investigation:
  
I am running on a Mac
 The bare minimum to reproduce this problem is on the following gist: https://gist.github.com/hnarayanan/a6397d6723fce19e2802d4305071e611
 I happen to use Emacs from MacPorts, but to double-check, I also attempted to download it from https://emacsformacosx.com and it crashed in the same way
 This seems to happen independent of the language server used in the backend. I intend on using python-lsp-server, but it fails even if I don't have it installed.
  
Has anyone faced a similar problem and found a solution? Perhaps I am doing something very wrong with my config? I'm eager to learn from your experiences and would greatly appreciate any advice or tips you can offer.
 Thank you!
 ⚠️Edit⚠️
 This appears to be something inherently broken with tree-sitter as installed by MacPorts (or the particular language grammar for Python). I decided to dig into this and built both tree-sitter and Emacs from scratch, and they work really well together without my memory problems.

 Can you help me to set it up correctly.
 I am new to Emacs and still trying to figure it out.

 could someone please explain how to get org-caldav to work with a radicale-server as I don't know what I am doing wrong...
 Or maybe give an org-mode noob a tip on how to debug such issues as I have tried and given up on orgmode several times in the past.
 So I have a radicale server that works with my android-clients and I am trying to sync with org using this in my init.el:
  (use-package org-caldav :ensure t :config (progn (setq org-caldav-url "http://10.10.10.100:5232") (setq org-caldav-calendar-id "mh") (setq org-caldav-inbox "/home/mh/test/calendar/cal.org")) ) 
 But when I then run org-caldav sync I am prompted for username and password and the eventual message "CalDAV sync finished. Nothing was done".
 So how do I get this to work?
 Many thanks!

 The roadblocks to this plan seem to be:
  
ScalablyTyped/Converter doesn't (yet) support the generation of Laminar Web Components, but only React and Slinky. The path of least resistance is to augment this tool to generate Laminar Web Components, too, but I have no clue how to do that (yet), or even if this is the optimal path.
 I'm fairly new to this ecosystem, so I'm looking for pointers, effort estimates, existing implementations, help, ideas, etc. before I launch in this direction. I'm surprised this doesn't exist already because, to me, it is a winning combination! path.
  
I'm fairly new to this ecosystem, so I'm looking for pointers, effort estimates, existing implementations, help, ideas, etc. before I launch off in this direction. Basically, I'm surprised this doesn't exist already because to me, is a winning combination!
 Existing things I've researched but I'm not interested in (so please don't bother suggesting them):
  
Things like the incomplete and archived Laminar Web Components because it is unmaintained, outdated, and based on a complicated generator that is only known to work on Material UI 3
 The st-material-ui repository because it only generates for ReactJS or Slinky right now, although the approach used by this library is nearly exactly what I want if it only supported Laminar Web Components
  
Thanks in advance for any thoughts you may have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Calc'c elisp functions (imho) all have the prefix calcFunc-. So in order to use a calc function like vlen in an org table lisp formula, one could use calcFunc-vlen. That's nice.
 What bothers me is the lack of "on-line" documentation (i.e. usable with eldoc or completion frameworks).
 All calc functions are nicely documented here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html , thats good.
 It is possible to modify a elisp's function documentation. e.g. like so:
 (put 'calcFunc-vlen 'function-documentation "Computes the length of a vector. The length of a non-vector is considered to be zero. Note that matrices are just vectors of vectors for the purposes of this command.") 
 Now calcFunc-vlen would have a nice "on-line" documentation, usable with C-h f, autocompletion and eldoc.
 Has anyone already bothered to gather some of those strings from the manual, in a more machine processable form? So I could save some work to create "on-line" documentation of the calc functions?
 Edit: following screenshots are intended to make it clear, what I want it for:
 company completion and echo help
 ivy ivy-rich and function docstrings

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm new in Haskell. Currently I'm working on a "SQL" project and I got stuck on deserializing JSON file contents. This is how the file looks like:
 {
 "Table":"flags",
 "Columns":[
 {"Name":"flag", "ColumnType":"StringType"},
 {"Name":"value", "ColumnType":"BoolType"}],
 "Rows":[
 [{"Value":"StringValue a"}, {"Value":"BoolValue True"}],
 [{"Value":"StringValue b"}, {"Value":"BoolValue True"}],
 [{"Value":"StringValue b"}, {"Value":"NullValue"}],
 [{"Value":"StringValue b"}, {"Value":"BoolValue False"}]
 ]
 }
 And this is what I've been working with:
 data FromJSONColumn = FromJSONColumn {
 deserializedName :: String,
 deserializedDataType :: String
 } deriving (Show, Eq, Generic)
 ​
 instance FromJSON FromJSONColumn where
 parseJSON (Object v) =
 FromJSONColumn <$> v .: "Name"
 <*> v .: "ColumnType"
 parseJSON _ = mzero 
 And I don't understand why I'm always getting this error:

 Could somebody explain how to write instances for such files (files that contain tables) ? How should I do it? I'm truly lost.
 P.S. This is the DataFrame I'm working with: 
 data ColumnType
 = IntegerType
 | StringType
 | BoolType
 deriving (Show, Eq)
 data Column = Column String ColumnType
 deriving (Show, Eq)
 data Value
 = IntegerValue Integer
 | StringValue String
 | BoolValue Bool
 | NullValue
 deriving (Show, Eq)
 type Row = [Value]
 data DataFrame = DataFrame [Column] [Row]
 deriving (Show, Eq)

 Read more about the release here: https://simplex.chat/blog/20231125-simplex-chat-v5-4-link-mobile-desktop-quantum-resistant-better-groups.html
 Thanks to work of u/angerman we now can compile mobile apps for iOS and Android with 9.6.3, but iPhone 7 (and earlier) and Android 10 are not supported yet with this build, so it uses GHC 8.10.7 for mobile apps and 9.6.3 in desktop apps.
 Some observation about 9.6.3 on mobile: it seems to have reduced overall CPU usage, but made apps much less responsive. Surprisingly, it was resolved by moving hs_init call to background thread - nothing in the docs suggested that it would made any difference, but it made the apps much more responsive on iOS (yet to test on Android).
 Does anybody know why it could have happened?
 We now use these RTS options that also help responsiveness and reduce memory usage by 10% (when the usage was large): - -A16m (chunk size for new allocations) - -H64m (initial heap size) - -xn (non-moving GC)
 Let me know if you have any comments on these!
 Thank you!

 Given that I'm writing a library, when interacting with this library as a consumer would you expect to interact with it in the context of a monad, or is there some pattern that avoids this?
 Edit: the example mentioned above is shown here https://stackoverflow.com/a/58908135

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Other than EMURGO Academy, are there any instructor led Haskell courses/bootcamps? I’m on a waitlisting for a cohort in January and I’ve got a feeling I’m not gonna make it. So in the likely event I’m forced to wait until spring, does anyone know any alternatives?
