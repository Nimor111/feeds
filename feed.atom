        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Emacs for maybe six months now on both my Windows and Linux machines for all my programming, word processing, and personal organization. Couldn't be happier with my productivity, and the community is great! Tons of tutorials, terrific documentation on almost all the packages I need, and just generally cool, helpful folks. I've followed the community's advice on a whole lot of matters, including keybindings: I read people saying that CUA bindings would interfere with the bindings of many Emacs packages, that made sense to me, so I've learned and ingrained Emacs bindings into my brain. It's great! Until those terrible, dark times when...I need to leave Emacs.
 And discover that Emacs has trashed my muscle memory.
 Whenever I'm in a browser (can't use EWW for everything...right??), I find myself constantly closing tabs when I meant to cut text. I save files when I mean to search. If I use another app for long enough, I eventually do adapt back to CUA, but if I'm rapidly switching back-and-forth between Emacs and anything else, I start making mistakes the moment I relax into autopilot.
 How do y'all handle this? Do you extend Emacs bindings out to the rest of your system (and does that work across platforms)? Do you suck it up and tread carefully outside Emacs? What do you do when you face an app that can't be easily brought into the Emacs ecosystem?

 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/changelog
 Please give it a try. Here is a cabal.project template: https://gist.github.com/Bodigrim/9834568f075be36a1c65e7aaba6a15db
 This work would not be complete without a blazingly-fast UTF-8 validator, submitted by Koz Ross into bytestring-0.11.2.0, whose contributions were sourced via HF as an in-kind donation from MLabs. I would like to thank Emily Pillmore for encouraging me to take on this project, helping with the proposal and permissions. I'm grateful to my fellow text maintainers, who've been carefully reviewing my work in course of the last six months, as well as helpful and responsive maintainers of downstream packages and GHC developers. Thanks all, it was a pleasant journey!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have often been in the position of giving advice to a novice programmer on what text editor to adopt for their day-to-day programming. Needless to say, I always recommend Emacs.
 I estimate that I have given such recommendation to 30-40 people over the years.
 AFAIK, my success rate so far is 0.00%. 1
 I would like to improve this abysmal success rate.2
 Hence I would like to ask those of you who resisted adopting Emacs at first, but ultimately did so, what took you so long? What were the barriers?
 And to those who have a better success rate than 0.00% at getting others to adopt Emacs, what is your secret?
 1 What is even more bewildering, some of these programmers, who ended up choosing a different editor, have later told me that they wished that they could do with their editors the things that I can do with Emacs. (To hear them say such things one would think that they had had to settle for a less powerful editor, because Emacs had not been an option for them, somehow.)
 2 My motivation here is not mere proselitism. Some of the people in question are actually co-workers, and I just want them to be more productive. It pains me to see how unproductive they are on account of the editors they use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When providing a type to users, a library can also provide lenses for that type without actually depending on lens. This is because Lens is a type synonym, so you can simply write a function with the correct signature and export it, to be used like a Lens. And even though there is a wide variety of lens packages (lens, optics, microlens, etc.) such a function is likely to work with most of them.
 This is all preamble to my actual question: how can a library do the same for streams? There are a number of streaming libraries out there (conduit, pipes, streaming, streamly, etc.) and a hypothetical library author would might like to provide streams or stream combinators to users that are compatible with as many of them as possible, but don't explicitly rely on those libraries. Does anyone have any information about what this could look like (assuming its even possible)?

 After a lot of trial and errors from my config, I pinpointed to the good-scroll package which seems to behave weirdly on wayland or maybe it's on pgtk or native-comp, i am not so sure. It does not show up when running on Xorg.
 just to make sure I am not insane I have made a video :

 Inspired by this post, I am recreating the Unity 2D tutorial in Haskell using apecs and apecs-gloss. I am nearly done: The graphics are rendered correctly, the levels are generated appropriately, the player responds to keyboard input, etc.
 As an extra, I want to be able to control the game with the Nintendo Switch joy cons. I have successfully connected the joy cons and I'm reading the input in the stepping function (6th argument of play - called periodically) instead of the event handling function (5th argument), as the latter only recognizes keyboard and mouse input. Here is an excerpt of what I'm doing in the step function, the full details of handleSwitch can be seen here (essentially read input if the buttons are pressed when the stepping function is called, interpret the input and update the scene).
 stepGame :: Float -> C.System' () stepGame dT = do ... ASTM.forkSys (Switch.handleSwitch dT) ... 
 Unfortunately, the player may respond to the first few inputs but then the game crashes. I thought it was a race hazard so I wrapped handleSwitch in forkSys (creates a new thread for switch input) but the issue persists.
 Any ideas on what might be going wrong and how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've long been a bit jealous of Mac users with the Choosy application that prompts the user for which browser they'd like to use every time they open a link. The only open source Linux alternative I've found is Braus, but I struggled to get it working. So, I let the matter drop - it wasn't important enough to me at the time. 
 However, it's starting to feel a bit more necessary in Emacs (for me). My entire life is in org files - both personal and professional. I tend to use separate browsers for work and personal use, so I'd love if anyone has clever solutions for this every time I open a link in Emacs. I should add, there are also times when I just want to use eww if I'm just looking up some documentation or static content. 
 I'm guessing I could either create some bindings for each browser function or I could manipulate the browser function to actually run a custom elisp function that opens a prompt. I'm just a bit curious if anyone else has felt the same way and if you have any insights you might be willing to share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, First time experience running Haskell, I wanted to spend some time learning the fundamentals during these holidays break. 
 I installed the Stack installer for windows to a Win10 core i5 (late 2019) laptop with 8 gigs of ram. I then proceeded to create an 'hello world' project - - stack downloaded GHC 8.10 and created a cabal file (very confused between cabal and stack differences but, I'll go with the flow). 
 The machine behaves well with other programing platforms. however, with Haskell/stack it seems very slow... I'm running stack build and stack test and it takes up to 1 minute in both cases if there is any change to compile (without recompilation, still takes about 30 secs).
 Was just wondering if this slowness is expected? I remember using it on a Ubuntu machine and didn't notice it being so slow. Maybe it has to do with the underlying C compiler arch?

If I try to file an issue on the emacs-helm github, I get this: An owner of this repository has limited the ability to open an issue to users that are collaborators on this repository. So how do I file issues? The issue might not even be with helm. The issue is when I run helm-make-projectile, it doesn't register targets as targets if they are followed by a '\' character. Not a huge deal. Just wanted to make it known. Just don't know how.

The low contrast is easier on my eyes, especially in low-light settings which I prefer to work most of the day.

 I have updated my package, dtache, to version 0.2 today. In short the major improvements compared to 0.1 are:
  
Support for macOS users
 A single completion interface with support for (improved) annotations, out of the box
 The dtache-env is optional and not required for the package to work
 Better error handling
  
I made a short video going through the changes as well as showing how to use the package. The video can be seen as a continuation on the previous video about the package: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De5oXdnY5hY
 The package can be found at: https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache

I heavily rely on tags to organize the notes and a feature that I wasn't able to find in org-roam is the possibility to have a list of all the tags I created, so that I can select a tag from this list and obtain a list of files with that tag. I know I can use org-roam-node-find, type the name of a tag and filter the files with that tag. However, given the large amount of tags I'm using, it's very hard to memorize all of them and I don't always know the exact name of the tag I'm looking for. Therefore, having a complete list with all the tags would be very helpful for me. Do you know if there's a way of having this feature in org-roam?

 :ID: 6dc9fdfe-d24a-4eaf-8152-1f663ba70a2e
 :END:
 #+title: example 
 * Header
 [[attachment:filename]]
  
Here the file filename is in the folder that is named based on the ID value: .attach/6d/c9fdfe-d24a-4eaf-8152-1f663ba70a2e, and I can link to the file without any issue.
 After I run org-id-get-create for * Header, I had a new ID added for the header, and it becomes something like below
  
* Header
 :PROPERTIES:
 :ID: cd858afc-45ca-4f3d-bde8-a6f68c8acad0
 :END:
 [[attachment:filename]]
  
Now the attachment link to the file filename does not work any more, I have to move the file to a new folder for the new ID created, i.e., .attach/cd/858afc-45ca-4f3d-bde8-a6f68c8acad0.
 This is annoying and I just wonder if there is a way to let the header * Header to search attachment in its parent's attachment folder as well? I tried to set org-attach-use-inheritance or set org-use-property-inheritance to t, but neither works.

 I shared Magit, Embark + WGrep, Hydra menus, Hammerspoon's editWithEmacs, and finally some functions I've written to help automate common tasks in writing pull requests (conformant to our company's Github PR template).
 I explained that while VS Code might be an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), I find Emacs to be an Integrated Computering Environment (ICE).
 I'm finding the more I use Emacs, the more I think about how I interact with files and text. I didn't convert anyone from VS Code to Emacs, but then again were I "only writing software" I probably would be using VS Code.

I don’t quite understand how to debug the Elixir LSP features (I’m mostly an elixir dev) and I don’t really know elisp to this point. I’m probably doing a bunch of awful shit and not realizing how much I could make my life easier. Plug-ins are weird, the docs confuse me. I want to learn emacs for real, and the idea of hand-rolling a vanilla config is kind of overwhelming and crazy to me. How can I dive into the world of emacs in little, manageable doses without biting off way more than I can chew or getting in over my head so far I just walk away?

 I've just set up emacs on a new machine using a configuration file that I am using already without any particular issues. 
 On the new box, every time I start up emacs, there is always the request to define the "fridge indicator" and it presents me 2 options:
 "Always"
 "Only When Focused"
 Once I pick up one choice the buffer get closed but it is quite annoying.
 What could be the cause of it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear friends,
I'm releasing phi-notes, an emacs package implementing a minor mode to work with a flavour of the Zettelkasten system I've been using for some years now.  It has the following characteristics:
Notes are identified by unique, sequential numbers (0001, 0002 etc.).
Notes may be linked using the wikilink syntax ([[0001]]).
Notes may have "parent" and "descendant" notes; they may also be linked to project notes.
Bibliographical annotation is supported with BibTeX references.
Notes may have tags (identified by #hashtags).
Notes have a YAML(ish) frontmatter to keep metadata and are (preferably, but not necessarily) written in Markdown.
The aim of this project is to develop features to ease the creation, navigation and linking of notes in one or multiple note repositories.
A sidebar functionality makes the minor-mode particularly useful for working with structure notes:

Other functionalities include: creating descendant notes, integration with helm, helm-ag and helm-bibtex; "killing" and "yanking" to notes, searching for tags and backlinks; navigation commands for visiting the parent, following links.
Some details of the implementation might be too personal, but the code may at least be useful as a starting point. I'm calling it a phi minor mode because this is how I named my system long ago.
More information and a setup guide are available on the GitHub project documentation.

 (defun consult-better-jumper () (interactive) (consult--read (better-jumper--get-jump-list) :prompt "Jump to: " :annotate (consult--line-prefix) :category 'consult-location :sort nil :require-match t :lookup #'consult--lookup-location :history '(:input consult--line-history) :add-history (thing-at-point 'symbol) :state (consult--jump-state))) 
 When I run this with M-x consult-better-jumper I get the following error:
 cl--assertion-failed: Assertion failed: (or (functionp candidates) (obarrayp candidates) (hash-table-p candidates) (not candidates) (stringp (car candidates)) (and (consp (car candidates)) (stringp (caar candidates))) (and (consp (car candidates)) (symbolp (caar candidates)))) 
 Upon investigation this error clearly comes from consult--read
 I guess my question boils down to how I can turn the list returned from `better-jumper--get-jump-list) into a data structure that consult can understand?

I’ve taken python which I found decent and enjoyable but I’ve heard mixed reviews about Haskell. I’m taking another programming class but I know myself and once it starts getting harder I might fall behind since I heard Haskell is extremely hard to learn. 
 I have about a month before classes resume and would love to do something productive with my time. So I’m wondering if anyone knows any good platforms or sites that do a really good job at teaching Haskell.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am going through Typeclassopedia, and currently got stuck at the first set of exercises in the Monad section, namely the 3rd one:
  
Implement Functor and Monad instances for Free f, defined as data Free f a = Var a | Node (f (Free f a)) You may assume that f has a Functor instance. This is known as the free monad built from the functor f.
  
I got the Functor instance for Free f, but with my Monad instance I am getting this error when trying to load it into ghci:
 • Could not deduce (Applicative (Free f)) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: Functor f bound by the instance declaration at Freemonad.hs:22:10-36 • In the instance declaration for ‘Monad (Free f)’ 
 My guess is that that's due to this part in the monad definition in Control.Monad
  
class Applicative m => Monad m where
  
which it seems like it wasn't always there.
 So:
  
Is there some other way around it, or do I have to provide instance of Applicative for Free f first? Bonus question: should Typeclassopedia be updated to include this information?
 I can't figure out how to implement Applicative for Free f, any hints?
  
In case it matters, here is my Monad instance, that I have convinced myself on paper that it should work
 instance Functor f => Monad (Free f) where return = Var (Var x) >>= g = g x (Node x) >>= g = Node $ (fmap.(flip (>>=))) g x 
 but I have also tried implementation from this stackoverflow answer and got same error in ghci.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a program in Emacs Lisp that turns a decimal number into a base-256 number. The numbers involved are very large, so here's the logic of it, where base256 is an array of unicode characters, myNum is a number in the septenseptuagintacentillions, and output is an output variable initially set to nil:
  (while (>= myNum 1) (setq output (concat output (aref base256 (mod myNum 256)))) (setq myNum (truncate (/ myNum 256)))) 
 I want to rewrite it in Haskell, but I'm having some trouble. Obviously, I can't use the same logic in Haskell, so here is what I have so far: ``` -- Builds an array of integers by taking the modulus of each iteration of dividing a number by 256 buildNum num = [mod x 256 | x <- (iterate trunkDiv num)] where trunkDiv l = truncate $ div l 256
 -- Create an array by accessing the item in my array of symbols that corresponds to a number in an array of integers mapNum nums syms = [syms !! y | y <- nums]
 main :: IO () main = do putStrLn $ mapNum (buildNum myNum) base256 ``` Now, as far as I can tell, what I need is to stop iterating when the truncated product of my number and 256 reaches 1, but I don't know where to even begin looking for that information.
 Could anybody give me some pointers on getting this to work?

This package empowers dired by giving it a modern UI in a unintrusive way. Emacs users deserve a file manager better than those popular ones on terminal such as ranger, vifm, lf since Emacs is not limited to a terminal.
 dirvish-minibuffer-preview.el is an extension for dirvish, it provides dirvish-minibuf-preview-mode, which is a feature to preview file when narrowing file/directory candidates using minibuffer.
 In dirvish, you can mark files across multiple dirvish buffers, and paste/move marked files/directory to current directory with one keystroke (dirvish-yank).
 The name dirvish is a tribute to vim-dirvish.

 If anyone is inclined to pick up where we left off, or start a brand new branch using some or all of what we did, please do! Please communicate your intent on the PR itself so if there are others who want to also work on it, you don't have to duplicate their work.
 There's another new tool in this same space, Stack Lint Extra Deps. The maintainer was kind enough to get on a phone call with us on Monday to discuss pros and cons of working on SLED vs Renovate, and the consensus is we'd all like to see Renovate support Haskell first. But Renovate is written in TypeScript and SLED is written in Haskell so if you'd like to help but don't like/know TypeScript, SLED is a good candidate to hack on :D

 (my question is not 100% emacs related, posting it here cause there are lots of programmable keyboard users on the sub and discussion might be useful)
 I am new to keyboard layouts, could you help me with the following?
  
Layer toggles vs combos
  
Let say i want to have navigation on ijkl,
 I could toggle on / off navigation layer when modifier button is pressed
 or i can make combos: modifier+i = up, modifier+j = left, etc.
 Which approach is better and when each of them should be used?
 With first you have to be mentally aware about current “modes” you are in, with second you have to keep modifier button pressed.
  
Modifiers vs different keys to express degree of action.
  
Let say i have following 3 actions: (emacs related)
 delete char
 delete word
 delete line 
 I could make them
 Modifier1 + d, Modifier1 + w, Modifier1 + e
 Or i can make them
 Modifier1 + d, Modifier2 + d, Modifier3 + d
 Which approach is better / more logical? How would you do it and why?
  
What writer/programmer friendly layouts you can recommend for inspiration? (40% or 60%, not bigger). I am not interested to learn about letter layouts (qwerty, dvorak, etc) but more about positions / layering of universal keys (delete, backspace, enter, navigation, numbers, etc) I saw miryoku layout, is there smng else to learn from?
 
Are there other resources you can recommend related to above? 
 
 p.s. I have all modifiers under thumbs

 I wonder how many people are still using ledger for their personal finance given there are a lot of online services with good phone apps.
 One of my goals in 2022 is to keep my finance in a good shape. I previously used ledger and org-capture to log transactions and reporting. but it's a lot of work given the number of transactions per week. this is one of the reasons i give up. If i continue to use emacs/ledger, i need to simplify the workflow, maybe import from CSV and convert to ledger once a week/month or something. 
 ​
 another reason I gave up is that i have joint accounts, using emacs/ledger makes it harder to share.
 ​
 any comments on how you use Emacs or not use Emacs for personal finance would be greatly appreciated!

For example if I have a file ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt and I type C-x C-f ~/foo/qux, ido-mode automatically searches ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt and autocompletes it in the find-file minibuffer.
 But when I do the same thing with fido-mode, nothing happens. In fido-mode, I am required to type the complete path like C-x C-f ~/foo/bar/baz/qux and only then it autocompletes the path to ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt.
 It seems that ido-mode can search for filename matches recursively in subdirectories. How can I get the same result in fido-mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 When folding in org-mode, if I'm not on a heading, I use outline-up-heading to move to the parent heading of the content and fold the heading using org-cycle. However, in doing so, the cursor becomes trapped in the invisible region of the heading's content, as shown by invisible-p (point), in such a way that, if I quickly change my mind and want to unfold the heading again, I can't just org-cycle again; I have to manually move the cursor into a visible region of the header, like the beginning of the line, then org-cycle to unfold.
 So basically my question is: How do I move the cursor to a visible region after folding a heading, and not get stuck in an invisible region, and be forced to move the cursor manually?
 Thank you kindly for the help!
  
UPDATE: I've solved this using (while (invisible-p (point)) (backward-char)), but it seems a tad inefficient; is there a better way to do this?

 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2021-12/msg00463.html
 Lot's of interest, judging from the epic threads that have ensued since then.
 There aren't many programming languages or systems where you can just assume the existence of a built-in relational database. The IBM AS/400 was one such system from the 80s. Emacs could become one if the SQLite plan is executed.
 Looking forward to org-mode tables that are backed and fed from RDBMS tables.

 I just came across this one (from here) and I wonder how I ever did without it.
 (defadvice kill-line (before kill-line-autoreindent activate) "Kill excess whitespace when joining lines. If the next line is joined to the current line, kill the extra indent whitespace in front of the next line." (when (and (eolp) (not (bolp))) (save-excursion (forward-char 1) (just-one-space 1)))) 
 Another great one that springs to mind is Radian's find-file advice that automatically creates and deletes parent directories of new files.

 I thought about using DataKinds and KindSignatures to set if the Item can be used in trades and i thought about putting the class of a mage like if he is a Mage as a Phantom type. I dunno if it's a dumb but i want to learn creative ways to enforce some properties.
 What are the cool mechanics that u can enforce using types in Haskell? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, i just started to be a good citizen and write some regression tests for my code.
 Considering i have some error-type and a function that might result in an error:
 ```haskell newtype Username = Username{unUsername::Text} data UsernameError = ErrorNameLength | ErrorNameIllegalCharacter
 -- smart constructor for username newUsername :: Text -> Either LoginError Username newUsername name = ... -- inspects argument and might return Left ```
 in my HUnit test, how would I assert that e.g. newUsername with "" results in ErrorNameLength?
 My thoughts is to do it with pattern matching in do notation, relying on the MonadFail instance of IO. While this works, i see that HUnits assertion-functions allow to provide a descriptive error message in case of failure.
 Therefore I am questioning wether this would be the correct way.

 ```\documentclass[12pt]{article}
 \usepackage{minted} \begin{document} \begin{minted}{haskell} --type Stack a = [a] --push :: Stack a -> a -> Stack a --push xs x = x:xs
 --pop :: Stack a -> (a, Stack a) --pop [] = error "Empty List" --pop (x:xs) = (x, xs)
 data Stack a = Stack [a] instance Show a => Show (Stack a) where show (Stack [a]) = show [a]
 push :: Stack a -> a -> Stack a push (Stack xs) x = Stack (x:xs)
 pop :: Stack a -> (a,Stack a) pop (Stack xs) | null xs = error "Empty List" | otherwise = (head xs, Stack xs)
 \end{minted} \end{document} ```
 It was showing the error
 ``` line 3: Package minted Error: You must invoke LaTeX with the -shell-escape flag. \begin
 line 3: Emergency stop. \begin{document}
  : shell escape is disabled, so I can only detect \ifwindows. 
 ```
 Why it is happening and how to overcome it ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my continued attempt to get mstksg's AOC template working, I temporarily gave up on my MacOS attempt (thanks again /u/simonmic for the help so far!) and switched to my Linux box. After a long failure trying to use apt-get install haskell-platform and getting unfixable (by me) dependency errors, I switched to using ghcup (why do we even have haskell-platform if it's not going to work?), and things seem to be compiling and running.
 But now I have some (hopefully basic) questions. - The "Interactive" section of the documentation says I should be able to import an AOC.Run.Interactive package. I do not see how to do this. Where / how do I run ghci to import this? I can see the Haskell file in src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs, but import AOC.Run.Interactive fails with ghci run in either the top level or down in src. If I :l src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs I get Illegal lambda-case (use LambdaCase), but I didn't think that was the right thing in the first place. I assume I'm missing something simple and obvious here? - The "Executable" section of the documentation says I should be able to get a plain old runnable executable aoc-dev. How do I get this? Right now I'm using cabal run aoc-dev run 1 a for instance. (If I do build an executable, do I need to rebuild it when I change a day's solution?)
 As always any help is most appreciated.

Only within the myproject repository there is a subdirectory source/projects/myproject.
 Problem Statement: I want to edit the common code only within the master branch. How can I have Emacs default to read-only mode when opening files from myproject/source/shared and myproject/source/common-applications, but not from myproject/projects/myproject?
 FWIW, I am using treemacs and would love to find/create some sort of hook within that context.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An opening for a Post Doctoral position on hardware acceleration of functional programming languages (specifically, Haskell), at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
 The role will involve developing a special purpose processor for Haskell, aimed at outperforming the throughput and energy performance of CPUs. The project is inspired by graph reduction machines like GRIN from the 1980s, and modern FPGA/ASIC protypes PilGRIM and Reduceron.
 Candidates should have a background in hardware design and FPGA programming. Hardware engineering experience should include circuit design, developing processor architectures, memory hierarchies and/or instruction sets. Candidates should have some understanding of functional programming. Programming language implementation experience is desirable, but not essential. The project has close industry ties with Xilinx in Ireland and QBayLogic in the Netherlands.
 It is a three year project, starting in May 2022.
 The HAFLANG project:
 https://haflang.github.io
 Job details and application form:
 https://enzj.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX/job/1716/
 The application deadline is 28th February 2022.
 Contact the project's Principle Investigator, Rob Stewart ([R.Stewart@hw.ac.uk](mailto:R.Stewart@hw.ac.uk)), with inquiries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asking this for u/Lucky-Lambda since he is a new user and has been waiting for days for moderators to approve his post:
 ==== QUOTE START ====
 I am trying to test a Stack project that contains an exe, lib, and tests. We have tests for lib now (with lib listed under test `dependencies:`), and exe depends on lib in the same way, but there is an aspect of the exe I'd like to test.
 I have tried to use `verbatim` in my package.yaml to get hpack to pass along `build-tool-depends`:, which should allow me to reference a `project:executable`. I do see it does include it at the bottom of that `test-suite` in the generated Cabal output, but I still get a `Could not find module` in the test file itself (what I am importing there is listed in the `executable` section `other-modules:`) when running `stack test`.
 I have also tried referencing the exe in the new test with `build-tools:`. It makes it into the cabal file, but without the project name prefix I originally included, and does not seem to help either.
 Any possible things I am missing or should try instead? It generates a cabal file with what I thought should work, but it does not seem to be exposing the module I am trying to import from exe in the test. Thanks so much! 
 Versions: * Stack resolver: lts-18.15 * Cabal: Cabal-3.2.1.0 * Running on a M1 Mac 12.1 in a Rosetta terminal (should not be ARM related, as it builds/tests just fine without the above attempt, just giving for context)
 ==== QUOTE END ====
 Remark from me (u/Martinsos): We also read that one solution is to move all the exe code to the lib and then exe just becomes an extremely thin wrapper. However, I love having this separation between exe and lib, on one hand to make sure that lib doesn't in any way depend on exe, and also because external/hackage dependencies are nicely separated, so I would rather avoid that if there is a nicer way to do it.

 There wasn't a followup given to this statement in the book I am reading and I am trying to wrap my head around it. It is easy to follow how a Num must be Eq, but why does it also have to be a Show. If anything I would imagine conforming to Read would be required. 
 So when you do 5 * (6::Double), internally do a read as Double for 5. 
 Is it that compiler does (read (show 5)::Double) * (6::Double)?

 I recently replaced my ssh-agent by gnupg (https://opensource.com/article/19/4/gpg-subkeys-ssh). This works fine outside of emacs (I can ssh server and it uses the gpg key). This part (replacing ssh-agent with gpg) especially does not work inside emacs, other parts (decrypting a file with gpg) work fine.
 This is all from withing emacs -nw -Q. This is all in the terminal, emacs not graphical.
 I am able to use emacs to edit an ecrypted .gpg file from within emacs, it asks for the password in the minibuffer and I can enter it: https://i.imgur.com/SON3tM6.png
 However I also use my gpg keys to access other computers through ssh (enable-ssh-support in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf), and it seems emacs can't handle it well. The prompt in this case is broken and it doesn't detect my keystroke…]]></summary>

Since we don't have nice IDEs like Visual Studio on Linux and using Vim(the editor I usually use) as an IDE looks like a really stupid idea since bloating it with a bunch of plugins will make it slow and unpleasant to use, I am turning to Emacs which is more than a text editor(how much more I don't know, I just know it isn't just a text editor) and you can bloat it with plugins without really slowing it down much. I chose DOOM Emacs because I played with it half a year ago and liked the fact that it used the Vim key bindings by default, so I didn't really have to re-learn how to edit text files, and the fact that it comes pre-configured in a nice way, saving me a lot of time.
 Anyway, what I want to ask is if I can turn Emacs into a nice C ID, and if it is possible, how do I do that. Thanks in advance.

just a repository or tarball containing a file named flake.nix that
specifies dependencies on other flakes and returns any Nix assets such
as packages, Nixpkgs overlays, NixOS modules or CI tests.

 I use emacs mostly for academic writing. As a beginner, I thoroughly enjoy org-mode. However, for practical reasons (journal submission, co-authoring, etc.), I need to create a word document (.docx) more often than I thought. I've used pandoc to convert .tex to .docx, which I am more or less satisfied with. 
 I wonder if anyone has a nice workflow for academic writing, which often needs to end up with a word document. For example, if a bibliography is included, which, markdown or org-mode, gives you a better experience? Or are there other options? Any suggestion will be welcome!

To give you some context, I never professionally worked with Scala so I have a lot of assumptions which certainly aren't applicable.
 My first question would be about Tagless Final and ZIO. Because ZIO embeds its own Error type as ZIO[R, E, A], if using ZIO as a Tagless Final, it becomes possible to abstract and hide away one layer or Errors. So I have been trying to separate System errors from Business errors in the sake of having a Domain layer curated of error handling for the System errors.
 System error would be, what I qualify as lower level and environmental errors, as network connection drop, remote service being unreachable, etc. Business erro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am interested in creating a "filtered" switch-to-buffer function. I was looking into the read-buffer function as its 4th argument PREDICATE mentions
  
Optional arg PREDICATE, if non-nil, is a function limiting the buffers that 
 can be considered. It will be called with each potential candidate, in 
 the form of either a string or a cons cell whose car is a string, and 
 should return non-nil to accept the candidate for completion, nil otherwise.
  
To my understanding, the predicate function needs to take one input argument which is a string or cons cell and when read-buffer is called it will pass every open buffer to the function and will only output those buffers that returned a non-nil value. At least this is what I understand from the docstring. 
 However, in practice, how exactly would you call read-buffer with this function as its 4th argument. I couldn't find any info online about it so I was wondering if this community had any clue how it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/hashkell !
 I'm working on a programming assignment where I'm asked to speed up a BFS type algorithm (a N-puzzle solver to be specific) with parallelism. I've tried using parMap to evaluate the next the potential moves and their costs in parallel. But this has only made my program slower. Is there something wrong with my approach?
 I'd also like to run the actual path finding recursion with all candidates (or the best two) at the same time but I've heard this isn't really possible due to the function returning an IO(). Is there anything I can do to make this part of the program go faster?
 Ideally I want something like this:
 for each state in possible_future_states: new thread(target=BFS, args=variables updated with this state being chosen) 
 Thank you for reading this. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

 I thought I'd solved this by (following some instructions at the bottom of this link) installing LLVM using homebrew and adding `/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin` to my path; in fact, I even seem to have one repo where it's working and another where it isn't, and I have absolutely no clue why. Can anyone offer any suggestions, or suggest other forums to ask?
 I note that opt is definitely in the path:  % which opt /opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/opt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have decided to spice up my holiday coding session consisting of nigths between 22/12-07/01 by swapping VIM for Emacs, so I have a couple questions.
 Premise for the setup; I'll start from vanilla Emacs and I aim to have a minimal set of packages enabling me to write some C/C++ with completion (lsp and/or deep stuff not necessary) and a nice (simple) way to browse project related files.
 Questions:
  
What packages do you recommend and why?
 Configuration recommendations/snippets?
 Keybindings you can't live without?
 Suggestions on good/must reads on the topic?
  
I've set up a repo containing some initial configuration which you can find here: https://codeberg.org/0xedd1e/dotfiles
 So far I've found Emacs to be really interesting and the package management seems superb (and easy). I also want to mention that I will not install evil-mode, at least not during this period.
 Ps. Not interested in an Emacs dist, I like keeping stuff clean and understandable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i tried to write a program with a gui and decided to use gloss to render it. But when i try to import the module, Graphics.Gloss it says it's not found. So then i tried to cabal install gloss but it outputs the following error message:
 cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library: * Missing (or bad) C library: GL This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that provides this library (you may need the "-dev" version). If the library is already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags --extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where it is.If the library file does exist, it may contain errors that are caught by the C compiler at the preprocessing stage. In this case you can re-run configure with the verbosity flag -v3 to see the error messages. cabal: Failed to build OpenGLRaw-3.3.4.1 (which is required by gloss-1.13.2.1). See the build log above for details. 
 So naturally i tried to install the library with cabal, OpenGlRaw but that gave the same error message except the gloss part. I tried to find information about this library but couldn't find anything useful for me, I am using nixos but the error appears on a secondary computer with fedora as well. I have opengl installed through my NixOS configuration and i have tried several c compilers or other openGL packages. This may not have to do with haskell but i assume i will get just as much help here as on r/NixOS 
 I am glad for anyone taking their time to help me.

 I am using the vscode css-language-server binary with eglot, and it's working great in css files, but when I open up sass files, it does not work with the current sass syntax that does not have braces or semi-colons. When I type the css-ls auto-completion does not work correctly, and syntax errors get thrown even though the syntax is correct and sass code compiles fine without any errors.
 Any tips on how to fix this issue?
 I'm guessing that sass-mode needs to get installed and configured with css-ls/eglot in use-package(my setup)?
 Thanks in advance for the help

 It started when I realized that Info-mode was presenting links with an illegibly bright cyan, which I realized was #00ffff. This is despite the fact that modus-themes supports info-mode, defines a cyan which is not that color, and I have no other theme loaded.
 So why was info-mode using the "wrong" cyan? Or do I need to take special steps to configure modus-themes to apply to info-mode?
 For that matter, how come I can't see modus-theme's cyan anywhere in the list shown by list-colors-display? And where do the other named and defined colors on that list come from?
 How do I even get the color of the character at point?
 I realize these are basic questions but I'd appreciate any pointers on how to understand this are better.

 I found ng2-mode in this github repo and a minimal layer setup for it in another random repo here.
 I added and angular folder to the layers directory and added it into the loaded layers in .spacemacs config file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't figure this out...
 I use a basic org-capture template:
 (setq 
 org-capture-templates
 \(`
 ("t" "Task" entry (file "~/.config/emacs/journal/tasks.org")
 "* TODO %?\n\n %U\n %a\n %i" :empty-lines 1)
 ("i" "Idea" entry (file "~/.config/emacs/journal/ideas.org")
 "* IDEA %?\n\n %U\n %a\n %i" :empty-lines 1)
 ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/.config/emacs/journal/journal.org")
 "* %?\n %i\n")
 )
 )
 When I start the capture and select 'j' to create a Journal entry, my first line has 7 stars. This causes the entry to start too far to the right and it looks weird. I can't figure out why so many stars? Instead of 7, I expect maybe 4 stars:
 * Year
 ** Year-Month
 *** Year-Month-Day
 **** new journal entry goes here
 In an effort to learn elisp and try to fix the problem, I tried to modify org-datetree.el in the ~/.emacs/elpa/org-9.5.1 directory and recompile via emacs-lisp-recompile function after visiting the file. My modifications change the output (I removed tabs for example), but then it removes all of the dates! I don't want to mess too much with the el file as my configuration is getting to a nice stable state.
 Any ideas why so many stars? Thanks in advance for looking at this!

 I use Emacs for writing scientific texts in LaTeX, and so a spell checker/grammar checker is obviously important. I have yet to find a solution that I am happy with, so I would like to hear if anyone has some good suggestions.
 I have earlier used flyspell, but it falls short compared to Grammarly, LanguageTool and Trinka, as it only corrects words, and has no "contextual" understanding.
 I have tested lsp-ltex, which worded quite well, but I found it way too intrusive. Sure, I could probably have gotten it to work if i tinkered enough, but I feel like something so essential as a spell checker should be simple. For reference, below are two other threads related to this, but I did not find the answers there satisfactory; in particular I feel like many of the solutions are made for pure programming languages, and then bodged together to work with LaTeX.

 I'm a regular Emacs user, testing the version 28 for some months ago (right now in 28.0.90). 
 Looking at the git repo and the devel mailing list, I was wondering if there are criteria/policies/requirements to declare a branch stable enough to be released. 
 The nearest example is, of course, Emacs 28, but I don't know if there are some guidelines for any future release (28.2, 29, etc). 
 Thanks.

 On my keyboard now with left thumb i can press comfortably first closest to space bar modifier, somewhat comfortably second closest to space modifier; with right thumb even first closest to space modifier is not comfortable.

It looks like a svg problem to me, when I open and view the code of these svg's the one I created and exported has a slightly strange ending. Do you know where there is a good place to create these images with the "real svg"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to figure what is done to figure out the searched symbol name when xref-find-definitions is called.
 The problem is the following. When I'm in org mode and in elisp source code block I try to use xref-find-definitions when my cursor is located on a string ";; `own-variable'". Then emacs says "no definitions found for "own-variable'". So it somehow falsely thinks that the final single quote is also part of a symbol name. How do I find what is being used to decide what's the searched symbol name?
 I tried profiling, and debug-on-entry for xref-find-definitions but that seems to be too late. The symbol name is already been made.
 I have an impression that Org mode uses "pcomplete-completions-at-point" for this completion but I did not manage to use debug-on-entry for that. I found the pcomplete-completions-at-point function by evaluating "completion-at-point-functions" in the buffer.
 Any tips would be welcome.
 EDIT: I'm able to jump to the definition with the following combination: M-x find-variable RET RET.

 I am currently an intern at a bank that's using Java and Spring for almost all of its backend services. My mentor tasked me to explore the basics of Scala for backend services so I'm here to ask for recommendations how one would build backend services as I've read around Scala doesn't depend as much on frameworks as Java does. 
 I've read on some 'frameworks' for Scala such as Play and Http4s, but the resources on those are quite scarce, and I've tried Http4s but I can't get my head to wrap around dependency management using sbt.
 Are there any recommendations you would give me for learning?
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running the following with stack script --resolver=ghc-9.0.1 works, but running with stack script --resolver=ghc-9.2.1 results in a stack overflow. Oddly, it works on ghc-9.2.1 compiling with -O2 but hangs when compiling with -O0.
 This behavior is surprising to me because, to my understanding, UndecidableSuperClasses carries the risk of infinite loops when type-checking, but at compile-time, it should concretize m and FooM m and the constraints should be erased. Is this not what happens? And did anything change in GHC 9.2 regarding UndecidableSuperClasses?
 I've also dumped out -ddump-tc for both -O2 and -O0, but I don't see any meaningful differences.
 Repro:
 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-} {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-} {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableSuperClasses #-} import Data.Kind (Type) class (Monad m, MonadFoo (FooM m)) => MonadFoo m where type FooM m :: Type -> Type runFoo :: FooM m a -> m a newtype MyMonad m a = MyMonad { runMyMonad :: m a } deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad) instance Monad m => MonadFoo (MyMonad m) where type FooM (MyMonad m) = MyMonad m runFoo = id main :: IO () main = runMyMonad foo foo :: MonadFoo m => m () foo = runFoo $ return () 
 Update: It seems reproducible with even main = runMyMonad $ runFoo $ return ()

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given a set of coins and an amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount.
 Note: a coin with a unit value is always assumed to exist in the given set of coins.
 Examples:
  
 Coins Amount min. no. of coins 
  
 {1,5,10,25} 1 1 
  {1,5,10,25} 4 4 
  {1,5,10,25} 5 1 
  {1,5,10,25} 6 2 
  {1,5,10,21,25} 63 3 
 
  
Say we are given a set of coins Cs = {1,5,10,21,25} and we want to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up 63, then the algorithm below essentially translates to the following:
  answer = min_coins(Cs, 63) = minimum ( min_coins(Cs, 62) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 58) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 53) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 42) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 38) + 1 ) 
 A direct haskell implementation of the above strategy is:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been a happy Gnus user for years. Recently, though, it was persuasively brought to my attention that threads are fundamental to how emails work, so I have introduced some redundancy to my system in order to make the threads work. Now I find myself conflicted about how to resolve these three constraints:
  
Make "sent" messages visible anywhere, as sometimes I use a different computer at a different location. For this, I've made an email account which has the sole purpose of receiving BCC of all emails I send, and so I subscribe to this SENT inbox to get those messages.
 
I use the GCC field to store a local version of my email upon sending, which has the advantage of storing the BCC recipients that are omitted from my SENT emails (especially useful when I send an "undisclosed recipients" email).
 
I wish to see things in both my Sent folder and in-thread in my usual inbox location. This is working except that I end up with duplicates of message I've sent. I expect one in my sent folder and another in my inbox, but I am receiving two in my inbox, and (gnus-summary-ignore-duplicates t) doesn't seem to make any noticeable difference, even though one of the messages I end up with in my inbox states "this is a duplicate".
 Any improvements or alternatives that meet the needs of synchronizing mail across machines, maintaining a "sent" box, and allowing email threading in my inbox?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working with lsp and company and found a very annoying feature that i would like to disable, when there is only one thing that can be suggested it is displayed like the image below, basically the word or symbol is "auto completed" on its own if i press tab if it is only a single suggestion. The problem is when i type too fast, for some reason this auto complete lags behind and actually affects the characters i input. So if i start typing sudo like below, if i am fast enough it will end up ignoring some of my input characters and i end up with suo or sdo sometimes. This placeholder is nice, to see but i dont want it to affect my actual keyboard input because it is slower than my type speed.

 EDIT: The issue did not seem to be related to the tooltip, nonetheless the answers below offer a perfectly good solution to replacing the tooltip with either nothing or the default company auto complete box (with only one suggestion). The problem was for some reason related to only typing the character "t" (for some reason) and the binding to (tab) i used to trigger auto complete in addition to enter (<return>). 
 (define-key company-active-map (kbd "tab") #'company-complete-selection) 
 This above was causing the character "t", when typed in the buffer while company was filtering, to somehow lose focus from the buffer and stop typing in it.
 (define-key company-active-map [tab] #'company-complete-selection) 
 This however works fine, and tab also does what it is supposed to be doing - completing the marked suggestion.

For example, the code block below I have added some lines to the initial implementation but, I am not sure, wether this is practical since some updates later will ament the code added in the file. 
 I hope I am clear, but to add some clarification, while I am adding/editing the code in the package's implementation found in the installation, would there be a more efficient way to call this instead of editing the file here. 
 Example below -commented lines are the ones I have added in the original file- after updating the package they will be lost
 (defun sclang-switch-to-workspace () (interactive) (let ((buffer (get-buffer sclang-workspace-buffer))) (unless buffer (setq buffer (get-buffer-create sclang-workspace-buffer)) (with-current-buffer buffer (sclang-mode) (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (set-keymap-parent map sclang-mode-map) (sclang-fill-workspace-mode-map map) (use-local-map map)) (let ((line (concat "// " (make-string 69 ?=) "\n"))) (insert line) (insert "// SuperCollider Workspace \n") ;; (insert "// " (current-time-string) "\n") ;; (insert "// Ready to do thy Biding Master " (user-login-name) "\n") ;; (insert line) (insert "// using HTML Help: C-c C-h as usual, then switch to w3m buffer\n") (insert "// and do M-x sclang-minor-mode in order te enable sclang code execution\n") (insert line) (insert "\n")) (set-buffer-modified-p nil) cwd to sclang-runtime-directory (if (and sclang-runtime-directory (file-directory-p sclang-runtime-directory)) (setq default-directory sclang-runtime-directory)))) (switch-to-buffer buffer)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forgive the title, but I'm going crazy here. I have spent 14 hours trying to get this to work and no luck.
 The issue is back-links won't show up in my org-roam buffer.
 This is my config:
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") t) (setq org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/org-roam")) (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) (require 'org-roam) (org-roam-setup) 
 I have installed org-roam, and org-roam--sqlite-available-p is set to t.
 I created the nodes with org-roam-node-insert and can follow the links just fine with org-open-at-point.
 You can see my org-roam folder here (and my config file is in there too).
 https://github.com/thread314/org-roam-troubleshoot
 I've deleted my .emacs.d folder and run emacs -Q, same result. I've even tried it on a completely fresh virtual machine, backlinks still won't show up.
 I am running Emacs 27.2, Org 9.4.4 and Org-Roam 2.1.0.
 I have tried asking for help on the org-roam discourse and on the org-roam slack, no luck with either.
 I must be doing something wrong, but I just can't figure out what. Can anyone help?
 I'd be happy to make a donation of $200 AUD to a charity of your choosing if you can help me with this (if that helps sweeten the pot).

 haskell newtype AppM a = AppM { runAppM :: Handler } deriving ( Functor, Applicative, Monad, MonadIO, MonadUnliftIO -- This fails to compile ) 
 The problem is that Handler cannot derive MonadUnliftIO as it's a newtype over ExceptT ServerError IO a, which does not have an instance for it.
 In order to get derive an instance, here's a possible solution: ```haskell {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}
 module Lib where

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been going through the University of Finland MOOC course on haskell, and this example popped up:
 ​
 someLetters :: Gen String someLetters = do c <- elements "xyzw" n <- choose (1,10) return (replicate n c) *Examples.QuickCheck> sample someLetters "yyyyyyyy" "zzzzzzzzz" "xxxxxxxxx" "yyyyyyy" "yyy" "ww" "xxxxxx" "yyy" "yyyyyyy" "xxxxxxxxxx" "y" 
 My question is how is this 'someletters' fn a pure fn? It will always return a List of strings, but the strings will always be different. If it was modified to pass in a starting string, it would still produce a list of random length strings, so the even if the parameter is the same, the results will be different almost all of the time.
 Or is it not a pure fn, and is it then fairly easy to write non-pure functions in Haskell?
 TIA

 When I tangle, I want this output:

 But what I get is this; the second block is dedented, which produces broken output:

 Is there some way to get Org to preserve whitespace in source blocks?

 I am looking to solve the following problem. I am using org-agenda to view items marked as TODO. This presents a list. The list is long and it's a bit difficult to scan. Ideally, I would like to have an interface where only the first item would load, I would hit "n" and then the next and the next and so on until there are no items left.
 Is this possible to do? What are the steps to take to achieve this?
 Thanks very much!

 Should I always prepare them beforehand to have a consistent look (e.g. to have the same width through all the notes)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! :)
 I wanted to share a package that I have developed. This package makes it possible to run, and interact, with shell commands that are run completely detached from Emacs. The name of the package comes from dtach, which is the program that makes this package possible. 
 As a user you start shell commands in dedicated sessions using dtache. Here is a list of some of the features that these sessions offer:
 - The user have access to all of the output from a session
 - The user gets a notification when a session has finished
 - Sessions are automatically labeled success or failure
 - Sessions can be started on remote hosts
 - The user can easily rerun a session
 - Sessions can be opened in a compile mode, which effectively makes it mimics M-x compile
 For a more thorough walk through of the package, and how to use it, you can watch this video which I have created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if1W58SrClk
 And the package itself you can find at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellow 'macsers, and in particular, hej fellow hyperbole users,
 I recently started using Hyperbole as a knowledge base and must say I am quite satisfied. I have in as an org extension so I get the benefit of being able to hide/show contents while retaining the functionality of hyperbole/hyrolo (I believe, correct me if I'm wrong).
 However, there's one thing that really annoys me, and I would like to know how to change that. Whenever I come out of a hyrolo-fgrep query, my hyrolo file is in read-only mode. Which means that I have to change out of it every time I made an edit. I C-s'ed through the Hyperbole manual but couldn't find it mentioned anywhere.
 Since I am not yet very proficient with the inner workings of my kitchen-si *ahem* batteries-included computing environment I don't even have a good idea on how to debug it. Thus, any more or less general considerations are also warmly welcomed!
 Have a good day, fellows :)

contributors get together to fix as many build failures as possible
for the new release. The event is, as per tradition, called Zero Hydra
Failures, or ZHF for short.
This year, me and fellow hacker cab404
had organized a hackathon to help the cause and spread the Nix love
around. The basic premise was, quoting cab404:
Go—go—go!
We wanted to fix as many builds as possible, right before the
branchoff. Fixing the broken builds would allow NixOS 21.11 to have a more complete package
set.
The main point of this post is to share the experience with people
looking to organize similar events.

Due to the current lockdown in Moscow, we

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to match generic implicit conversion with quotes. Minified example:
 case class Wrapper[T](i: T) given converter[T]: Conversion[Wrapper[T], T] with def apply(wrapper: Wrapper[T]) = wrapper.i conversionParser { 1 + Wrapper(2) } 
 with
 // Want it to print "Success" def conversionParserImpl[T: Type](expr: Expr[T])(using Quotes): Expr[Unit] = println(s"Matching ${expr.show}") expr match case '{($a: Int) + ($b: Int)} => println("Addition") conversionParserImpl(a) conversionParserImpl(b) case '{$a: Int} if a.value.isDefined => println(s"Literal: ${a.valueOrAbort}") case '{converter.apply($a)} => println("Success") case _ => println("Not matched") '{()} inline def conversionParser[T](inline expr: T) = ${ conversionParserImpl('expr) 
 But output is:
 Matching 1.+(Main$package.converter[scala.Int].apply(Wrapper.apply[scala.Int](2))) Addition Matching 1 Literal: 1 Matching Main$package.converter[scala.Int].apply(Wrapper.apply[scala.Int](2)) Not matched 
 If the converter is changed from generic to concrete Int, then the quoted code matches without any changes to the macro. Tried case '{converter[Int].apply($a)} in the generic case, doesn't fix it.

 Also, maybe related, when trying to run fzf from the *shell* it doesn't provide the autocomplete list, even though it does so in windows cmd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a while I've been lurking on the development of cell-mode [1], an Emacs mode created by David O'Toole. The blurb says:
  
Cell-mode is an object-oriented spreadsheet control for GNU Emacs. It provides a major mode for spreadsheet-based user interfaces; it can be further extended by defining application-specific Emacs Lisp minor modes which supply new cell and spreadsheet classes via Emacs’ included object system, EIEIO.
  
I decided to create this post because I am not sure how widely known this mode is, and I'd like to raise attention to it. Personally, I think it is an amazing idea - a magit or org-mode-like "killer app" for Emacs. It may sound like I'm exaggerating (and perhaps I am), but just off the top of my head I can think of a few really interesting use cases:
  
integrate it with org-mode as a table editor. You could edit the table in cell-mode and then see the ascii representation.
 integrate it with modes such as SQL mode and the like, so that you could visualise the table output as a cell-mode spreadsheet.
 as just a plain old spreadsheet. Most of my use cases for excel would probably go away with it plus Emacs lisp.
 easy CSV (etc) editing.
 derived modes (see mosaic [2] by the same author).
  
I'm sure many more use cases would quickly emerge by integrating it with other modes. If you use cell-mode or know of similar modes in this space do let me know on the comments.
 Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with David O'Toole or cell-mode development, just a regular Emacs user.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favorite parts of Org-mode is the customizable colored headers; personally, it makes me extremely motivated to work and makes Org-mode so much more beautiful. Here's a quick script I made to make changing those colors easier, and hopefully, someone finds this helpful!
 ​
  
First, generate a palette you like from this color palette generator: https://coolors.co
 Copy the RGB color codes, separated by hyphens, from the url
 Paste it into the list in the same format as I have in the below code snippet
 Copy the code into your init file somewhere
  
Essentially, the code splits the string into a list of codes, then the face attributes set the org header colors to the corresponding list colors.
 I'd like to turn this into a package one day, but that's a project for another time (or if someone wants to help me, I'd love to work with them). And finally, if anyone uses this, drop your color palettes below!

I always run it in GHCI, and when I was using Stack I'm pretty sure I could rebuild incrementally. But then it stopped building in Stack, so I switched to Cabal, which only lets me rebuild incrementally for one subproject at a time -- if I make changes to another subproject, I have to quit and rerun cabal ghci. So suddenly compilation was taking a long time.
 I ducked the problem by just making it a monorepo again. But it made me wonder -- how hard would it be to make compiled code content-addressed, like Unison does?

        <updated>2021-12-14T13:32:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[List comprehension is a very appealing feature in Haskell. It could support a form of non-deterministic computation. 
 For example,
  [[x,y] | x <- [0..2], y <- [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] 
 However, this construct is too static. I mean that these two generators (x <- [0..2] and y <- [0..2]) are solidified in the code. If the number of generators is unknown (e.g. List of generators as input), there is no way to use the List comprehension gracefully. 
 One way to solve the problem is using Traversable:
  sequenceA [[0..2], [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] 
 Now we have a List of generators. So far so good.
 The drawback of this approach is that it cannot handle the variables' references in a generator's body.
 For example, 
  [[x,y] | x <- [0..2], y <- [10*x..10*x+2]] 
 We cannot represent [10*x..10*x+2] in sequenceA.
 Question:
 Is there any general way to do this job in Haskell? Maybe something like sequenceA, but can handle variables' references. Or do we have to write a small interpreter?
 Thanks
  
Edit:
 Some one possibly misunderstand my question.
 For example, if we just using List comprehension (or do-notation), how do we represent the following pattern in general way?
 ``` [[x1] | x1 <- [0..2]]
 [[x1,x2] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2]]
 [[x1,x2,x3] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 <- [100x2..100x2+2]]
 [[x1,x2,x3,x4] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 <- [100x2..100x2+2], x4 <- [1000x3..1000x3+2]]
 -- and so on ```
 It could be solved by code generation and interpreter pattern, but I hope a better way. It would be nice if code can be seen as data (e.g. List).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firstly doom emacs is great and God bless hlissner. But there's one issue I've not yet been able to solve. 
 In doom emacs when the cursor is on a string, it highlights the entire string. But this really slows the app down and makes the editing process really annoying in the case of long strings. 
 Example
 In the above link, I am trying to edit a graphql schema which is a multi line string. And the entire string being highlighted every moment makes it really laggy and nearly impossible to edit. 
 So my question is how do I turn of this string highlighting feature in doom emacs? Thanks
 PS: I have googled for this but I couldn't find te solution to this exact problem. Most of the solutions were to disable the hl-line mode which I don't have a problem with.

 ​
 Applications must go via these links:
 Warsaw: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=128083
 London: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100029752
 ​
 The Warsaw position is open to both contractors and direct employment, whereas the London one is only open for direct employment. Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll (PL or UK in this case), and after an initial 3-month in-office period (where circumstances allow). We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful employment applicants.
 Note that the first step of the application is a Valued Behaviours Assessment and it is quite important: our team won't be able to see your application until you pass this assessment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I'm currently writing up my PhD thesis using org-mode, and it is a joy in comparison to my past experiences writing raw LaTeX. 
 I'm simultaneously attempting to write up some of the thesis chapters in paper form for publication, and have been creating the papers by selectively #+INCLUDE -ing the thesis chapter .org files. I very much dislike the idea of maintaining the same text in multiple files (fix a typo or re-word something in one, will I remember to propagate those changes throughout?), however the text required for the papers needs to be somewhat more concise than what appears in the thesis. So far I have handled this by having org files containing the core text for a section, which appears in both the thesis and the paper, and another org file that expands on the core and appears in the thesis only. 
 This approach works well enough, but falls down when I want to interleave concise text and extended text. I could use the line number option for the include command to achieve this, however the text is changing too often for this to be practical. The natural conclusion seems to be to break things down even further, and to have separate org files per paragraph of text, and to construct larger documents out of these. 
 Does anyone here have any experience of something like this (maybe there are packages which could help?), or perhaps better ideas (i.e. am I being a lunatic)?
 Thanks!

 Is my assumption correct? Is there a cache somewhere?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading a discussion about keyboards and decided that maybe this is something that would benefit others.
 I have been pressing Ctrl with my palm for years (just below left pinky). It only works with external keyboards, and it does not work very well for all Ctrl combinations (e.g. Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-X is at the limit of doable, in that case I use the right ctrl).
 but it has saved my pinky from being overworked
 (and yes, I tried dvorak, but I could not get used to emacs ctrl sequences no matter how much I tried... i was able to get to around 40-50 words a minute for text, but like 1 emacs command per minute --after 59 wrong commands).
 Aside from mapping CAPS lock to Ctrl, are there any other tricks people use with the typical keyboard?
 Edit: somebody mentioned that this is probably useful only for small sizes of hands. When fully extended my hands are 21cm from tip of thumb to tip of pinky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Transient documentation:
 "The command can also be a closure or lambda expression, but that should only be used for dynamic transients whose suffixes are defined when the prefix command is invoked. See information about the :setup-children function"
 So according to that I tried the following:
 (defun set-children (children) '((1 transient-suffix (:key "o" :command normal-func)) ;; OK (1 transient-suffix (:key "k" :description (lambda () "All ok") :command (lambda (message "hey")))))) (transient-define-prefix my-transient () ["Description" :setup-children set-children]) 
 I'm getting (wrong-type-argument (command symbol) (lambda nil "hey"))
 So it seems that it only accepts symbols
 Any ideas? thanks in advance

While I like emacs, the keybindings are brutal to my old worn tendons. I know I can change them, but I lack the wherewithal to undertake a radical rebuild. I'm perfectly comfortable with vi but prefer something that's not modal. Are there any other total redesigns of keybindings or editing I should look at?

 I've been using ghcup to manage and install ghc, stack, and cabal on my mac. Now I tried installing ghc on windows with Chocolatey and Haskell Platform. It installs version 9.2.1 by default with `choco install haskell-dev`. I need version 8.10.7 installed since some packages that I'm using are not yet supported under 9.2.1. What's the recommended way to install 8.10.7. Is ghcup a viable alternative? I tried it and it seems not to have "tui" available on Windows for some reason.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! I've heard a lot of good things about Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason, but I've also heard a lot of good things about Functional Programming, Simplified by Alvin Alexander. I was wondering if anyone had any opinions on either book, or if people would recommend one over the other or something like that. Any insight is appreciated!

 Currently when i want to reference webpage in note (org-mode) i simply put url as link, but this method is not future proof. (website/company can die, url change, etc)
 How do you save / archive web pages?
 Do you use bookmarking tools like wallabag, shiori, etc?
 Or do you simply save webpage as pdf, epub etc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have prettier set to show errors when the format isn't correct. But in Emacs it shows an additional (formatting?) string. I don't know where I should report this to. In vscode and the terminal it shows just the Delete ';' part. Is this an ESlint or LSP error?

 I hope this makes sense
  
EDIT. In the meanwhile I removed eslint-plugin-prettier and installed prettier.el. I don't really need linting hints showing up as errors as it gets fixed on save, so this is great

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am trying to play around with semantic highlighting in lsp, and what i was trying to do is properly highlight usages of a function's argument/parameter within a given scope (say, code block, function etc.), and not only at the declaration point. It seems that lsp does understand scopes, looking through the source i found out that faces such as lsp-face-highlight-write/read/textual - which do actually highlight the variable when i hover over it with the cursor. Now i am looking at doing the same but make it permanent, not only when you hover over the symbol. Trying to do that for both member variables and function argument variables. Lsp has lsp-face-semhl-member & lsp-face-semhl-parameter which are only coloured at the point of declaration.
 In the example below, crude, but member variables are purple, while the ones passed as function arguments are underlined-pink. (The Styling is just a sample)

 ​
 I have brew (3.3.7), stack (2.7.3), and Cabal (3.6.2) installed, and I thought something as simple as "cabal update" or "brew update" or "stack update" would somehow magically work.
 ​
 For context, I am used to archlinux where arch documentation, a simple pacman -Syu or grabbing from the AUR solves 99.98% of my problems. But I am relatively new to apple hardware for development.
 Thanks a ton, and I apologize for the ignorance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use emacs on various machines. I run the same init.el and set of packages everywhere, but different versions of emacs itself. In particular I want my setup to support a relatively old version of emacs (26.3) which I can find or easily install on random machines.
 As a result, I'd like to upgrade my packages but only when they are compatible with this maximum allowed version of emacs itself.
 I can hit "U" in the package list to mark all packages which can be upgraded up to my current emacs version. What I do now is manually inspect the upgrade list, checking the dependencies of each marked package, and removing items which require a too advanced version of emacs. But this is cumbersome.
 Is there a command or a programmatic way to restrict this list to show only the upgrades which are compatible with the maximum allowed emacs version? I can't find any commands for this. I looked for package functions for querying a package's dependencies by package name, but it seems like most of the functions in package.el need a package-desc as input, and I'm not sure how to get that struct only from a package name and for available rather than installed versions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am trying to write a function for prettifying symbols on a per-mode basis. The idea is to accept the mode-hook and a list of substitutions, and then to create a hook and engage it with the mode-hook. The function looks like this:
  (defun +xx/prettify-symbols-set-hook (mode-hook symbol-list) (interactive) (add-hook mode-hook (lambda () (mapc (lambda (pair) (push pair prettify-symbols-alist)) symbol-list) (global-prettify-symbols-mode 1))) (message "Hook set.")) 
 An example of the intended use would be:
 (+xx/prettify-symbols-set-hook 'org-mode-hook '(("#+BEGIN_SRC" . ?») ("#+begin_src" . ?») ("#+END_SRC" . ?«) ("#+end_src" . ?«))) 
 I get no errors, but the hook does not seem to work. When I open new buffers of the given mode, the pretty-symbols do not appear. Any comments/suggestions would be very welcome as I am have very limited elisp experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I don't understand how to get an index of locally available documentation and installed packages.
 I added the flag: "Documentation: True", and indeed if I navigate to: '~/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/attoparsec-0.14.3-a88f9f2009aaf50ec4de28c96eaab575e97e192943bebbfec18a608dffd670fd/share/doc/html', all the docs are there, and they even link back to the ghc documentation (in 'file:///home/jurjen/.ghcup/ghc/8.10.7/share/doc/ghc-8.10.7/html/libraries'), which is great!
 But navigating or exploring to such funky directories is unwieldy and I cannot find a generated index and they are not linked into the standard index living in 'ghcup/.../share/doc/ghc-8.10/html' which is annoying since that is my main source of information for installed packages.
 I tried to set the options 
  docdir: /home/jurjen/.ghcup/share/doc/$abi/html/libraries/$libname htmldir: /home/jurjen/.ghcup/share/doc/$abi/html haddockdir: $htmldir 
 But that didn't seem to do nothing. Anyone know how to make a global index of all (user) installed packages with cabal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings from Canada 🙂
I was using nvAlt and Simplenote together for about 10 years and recently migrated to my own app, Hyperdraft, which I consider a web remake of Notational Velocity; my app is not based on files, but it supports markdown and you can own your data.
I'm interested in the idea of 'turning your text notes into a website' and have been cultivating a digital garden / personal wiki for about a year now, inspired by Andy Matuschak; in the same place as my private notes, I have other ones that are 'public', and they appear as pages on this website (wiki links become public URLs).
Learning about Zettelkasten over the last few years, it feels like I've been practicing it with todos and building projects, but not as much with 'knowledge'—my notes about the work of others 'slip away' because they are not interconnected and I don't put them in my note taking app. (I'm looking for an app that approximates manual sorting of index cards).
The 'searchable left-list' pattern is quite functional for me, and so I tend to incorporate it into all of my apps in some way. If you're interested to know more, check out my presentation called Wetware of writing and doing, where I also go into how I use Hyperdraft to make things happen.
Hope to hang out here more often as I have more to learn about Zettelkasten and maybe some apps to make 😉.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After learning Haskell for some time, I would say that grasping most libraries and using them to build applications is a doable task, what really puzzles me is how to cultivate the mindset to enable one to build complex libraries. Some examples would be servant (type-level concept), scotty (monad transformer concept), opaleye (profunctor concept), and a lot more. Many Haskell libraries use sophisticated techniques to achieve DSL, but we seem to lack learning materials (the design parts, not the practical usage parts) that are accessible to everyday programmers.

 I have a python setup with lsp, mspyls and company is used in the background for documentation completion (I think). For nearly all Numpy functions, company-show-doc-buffer returns an empty or sometimes wrong buffer. All other functions such as Scipy, built-ins or user-defined work perfectly well. Also, Code completion with company works fine for Numpy which is a bit weird.
 Has anyone encountered this as well? I read somewhere that Numpy added some decorators that might interfere with some APIs, but this also happens for old Numpy packages in a Python 3.5 environment.
 Please help :)

 I am in the lengthy process of learning several lispy programming languages, one of them being guile scheme. I've installed the guile3 package using AUR on Manjaro successfully. Its binary resides in /usr/bin/guile3, and I am able to run it from the terminal no problem.
 For Scheme hacking, I want to use the Geiser package of which I heard only good stuff. I can use it with MIT Scheme and Guile-2.2.7, the implementation that is chosen when installed from official Manjaro repos. However, Geiser does not find guile3. When I try M-x geiser, it says "Cannot find guile3 implementation".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is probably a super basic beginner question, but I'm struggling a bit to figure it out. I'm trying to make a simple web app to learn frontend development, and wanted some functionality supporting dropping files into the app, but I can't seem to figure out how to get the literal contents of the file dropped to send it over to Haskell. My Haskell server is set up with Servant, and the Purescript side with Payload, and I'm looking at the documentation for Web.File.File, but the types are all abstract, and I don't see how to get the actual contents of the file. I'm assuming it's stored as a Blob, but there aren't any functions for consuming blobs and Payload can't transmit them.
 So I thought maybe I need to use the Javascript FFI, and was looking at this page, but I see there are quite a few different ways to consume the files, and I'm not sure what the difference is, or what Purescript types they would translate to. I'm assuming the problem isn't actually super complex, but I'm just not quite sure what to try, as I seem to spend the majority of my development time trying to debug issues with the Haskell/Purescript sides communicating with one another, so I'm hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction to avoid wasting any more.
 Basically I'm looking for something File -> ByteString, so that the server can save/retrieve the file for later, without knowing the Purescript equivalent of ByteString.
 Alternatively, I mostly intend to have both the server and application running on the same machine, so if I can get the full filepath then I can just transmit that, and have the server read the file directly, but I can only seem to get the filename, and some googling seems to suggest the directory simply isn't stored in a DragEvent.
 Is there any easy way to do what I'm trying?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tagged it as AoC since my question came up doing one of those problems but its more of a general question I'd say.... 
 So I learned about Advent of Code and wanted to use it to learn some more Haskell.
 I did the first day, which went well. However I struggle with the second one...
 In theory it shouldn't be too complicated.. My approach was as follows:
  
Read the lines
 Split the lines in 3 different lists (depending in the first character)
 Sum up all values
 ---
  
1.-2. were no problem.
 With 3 I thought I can just use foldl like that 
 foldl (\ p c -> p + read (last c)) 0 testInputf
 where testInputf is a list of Strings ([String]).
 For me it would make sense that c is the whole String and last c is the last element of the String... However this doesn't seem to be the case here... if I write it like that Haskell throws an error saying, that 
  Couldn't match type ‘Char’ with ‘[Char]’ Expected type: [[String]] Actual type: [String] 
 And I can't figure out why... Is there anything Im missing? Is there a general way of getting all last elements out of the Strings in a String List?
 For testing purposes Ive also tried using map 
 map (read . last) testInputf 
 which throws the same error and I can't figure out why...
 Thank you very much!

It doesnt need to be opened in emacs, I write stuff in org but I export as latex then as pdf; so the on Linux qpdfview takes care off that. Anyway, the command to insert the pdf file, if you expand it is:
 [[file:/home/user/someplace/file.pdf][some description]] 
 This would generate a some description and I can click on it (either inside emacs which opens the PDF with Docview or qpdfview if I export it org to pdf). I check this, https://orgmode.org/guide/Hyperlinks.html and tried to change the code to:
 [[file:/home/user/someplace/file.pdf::6][some description]] 
 so that it automatically opens to page 6 of the pdf. This does not seem to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, r/haskell,
 I am working on Chameleon, an experimental visual type debugging tool for Haskell. A couple of months ago I posted an advertisement for a user study for Chameleon. After that post, I was overwhelmed by a very generous amount of participation and constructive feedback from the wholesome r/haskell community. This time I want to conduct the study with more complicated code challenges. Some of the code I took from real-life Haskell projects, such as Cabal, hledger, xmonad,etc.
 If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming research, or you want to check out our Haskell type debugging tool, please click this link to proceed https://sup.ercu.be. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 20 - 30 minutes to complete. But in turn, it will help us immensely.
 I am happy to answer any questions regarding Chameleon in this thread.
 Thank you,
 Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team

 I am a big fan of the Eyebrowse package, it is a cornerstone of my Emacs usage.
 I have just one issue with it - under some circumstances, I lose all my window configurations when restarting Emacs. It really hurts, so I wrote a small package called eyebrowse-restore that automatically saves Eyebrowse window configurations for all your Emacs frames and allows you to use them again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am looking for a way to override faces globally. For example force a face to inherit from another face all of its attributes. And want to avoid doing what i am doing below. What i do right now is something like the block below. But this is annoying. I looked into the Faces Wiki on Emacs found the remapping functionality - https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Face-Remapping.html. But it works just for the current buffer as far as i know. I want to avoid hooks for buffer switches to use the remapping, and preferably have this in my config, execute once, override the faces and be done at that point.
 What I am trying to achieve is force a few packages, which use custom face attributes (i.e helm-rg) to use the default attributes of my theme (i.e make the helm-rg-preview-line-highlight face force inherit/override itself from my mode-line face styles etc.). I am using doom-one theme - https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes (on vanilla emacs, not doom)
 (set-face-attribute 'dst nil ;; This is Just a sample, there are more attributes not specified here :underline 'unspecified :slant 'unspecified :weight 'unspecified :height 'unspecified :family 'unspecified :foreground 'unspecified :background 'unspecified :inherit 'src)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit:
 Based on the comments by u/p3tr4gon, u/psycotica0, I kind of understand how this partially applied type constructor works like.
 My little example use-case:
 type IntMap v = Map.Map Int v --says IntMap is a Map with an Int key and some type v Value --my toy example function to return an IntMap String intMap :: Int -> String -> IntMap String intMap num str = Map.singleton num str --and from the original question this also worked someAssocList = [(1, "John"), (2, "Lisa"), (3, "Mary"), (4, "Sandra")] myIntMap = Map.fromList someAssocList :: IntMap String --------------------------------------------------------------------- --ghci output below Prelude> :r [1 of 1] Compiling Shapes ( ch8_types.hs, interpreted ) Ok, one module loaded. *Shapes> intMap 2 "Noah" fromList [(2,"Noah")] *Shapes> myIntMap fromList [(1,"Noah"),(2,"Lisa"),(3,"Mary"),(4,"Sandra")] 
 And I agree that this is a toy example that probably does not have many use cases.
 Original question:
 In Learn You a Haskell 8.5, they have this example
 --partially apply type constructor type IntMap v = Map.Map Int v type IntMap' = Map.Map Int 
 How would I use this? I only know how to make a so-called IntMap like this
 import qualified Data.Map as Map someAssocList = [(1, "John"), (2, "Lisa"), (3, "Mary"), (4, "Sandra")] myIntMap = Map.fromList someAssocList --deleted due to typo please see edits above

Digging a little I see that org-return will only call org-open-at-point if (org-return-follows-link is non-nil and) calling (org-element-context) would yield something of the form "(link (:type...". Since calling (org-element-context) yields something like "(citation-reference...", org-open-at-point is never called when point is on a citation and I call org-return. 
 So... any easy way to do this, short of redefining org-return? (Or better, perhaps, to write a wrapper that will call org-open-at-point when point is on a citation and call org-return otherwise?) It seems to me that it would be convenient to have citations treated much like file:// expressions, but maybe there's a reason for not doing this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the title says it. Basically, I have a buffer full of babel code blocks that I don't want to run when I first load the buffer in Emacs. I see org-babel-execute-buffer, but how do you make sure it's off? I think the default behavior is already not auto-evaluating the blocks, isn't it, so I don't need to worry. So yes, how do you definitively control the org-babel-execute-buffer behavior on or off? It seems though, that an export to HTML etc. does try to run evaluate all blocks. How can that be turned off?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I've been trying for 2 days to get this to work. This is obviously not the right way. I get *invalid* in the mode-line and the CPU total usage is instead displayed in the minibuffer. Also it does create a *Shell Command Output* buffer. That buffer is not desired. 
 Im aware that I need setq-default but for the purpose of testing I use with only setq. I test in the scratch buffer. Before someone comes and ask why? And say "Emacs is a text editor!" I run EXWM and I need the CPU/MEM total usage to be displayed all the time. I've been looking for a package that would display these info rather in the mode-line or in the systray. I've found nothing :( However, I did find a package that does display these info in the minibuffer. The minibuffer is not the best place for this tho. Also that package was making my Emacs slow af. Dont ask for the name of the package, I dont recall. Plus, I dont want to hit on someone else work. I cant even write this function alone, so ya. 
 So if you want to help, please do and thank you :) Also, Im pretty sure this little function could be appreciated by other Emacs users. 
 Here's what I came with so far for the CPU:
 (defun cpu-usage-3 () "Display CPU Usage" (shell-command "ps -A -o pcpu | tail -n+2 | paste -sd+ | bc")) ;; Found that ps command line on the internet. I did not create that. (setq mode-line-format (list '(:eval (cpu-usage-3))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My situation: I offer lots of training. Around a training, several date-sensitive activities need to happen, that I would like to see in my agenda e.g.
  
a week before the training I need to order materials and exams
 the day before I need to set up the online whiteboard
 the day of the training, I need to conduct the training (and would like this to be reflected by a due date)
 one day after the training, I want to send a link to a feedback form
  
You get the gist.
 I'm wondering if there's a way to set up a capture template so that I enter "Training on subject X, on date Y", and org will automatically calculate the corresponding due dates for these surrounding activities and stick them into the newly captured structure.
 Any suggestions on how to accomplish this?

 I have created a simple hello-world app and running `sbt publishLocal` works fine. It seems like I need 2/3 different plugins for publishing to a remote repo? 
 If anyone has a simple example, it would be much appreciated! As long as I can run sbt publish from my terminal I'm happy
 Here is my code so far:
 ​
 build.sbt:
 scalaVersion := "2.13.3"
 name := "hello-world"
 organization := "ch.epfl.scala"
 version := "1.0"
 publishTo := Some("Hello-world app" at "<url>")
 libraryDependencies += "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-parser-combinators" % "2.0.0"
 ​
 plugins.sbt:
 addSbtPlugin("com.github.sbt" % "sbt-native-packager" % "1.9.4")
 addSbtPlugin("se.marcuslonnberg" % "sbt-docker" % "1.8.2")
 addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "x.y.z")

The changes I've made so far are pretty obviously good, and make a big difference in even the most informal testing. But to make decisions about smaller points, I really need benchmarks, and the package has none. Does anyone know of a benchmark suite for priority queues? One that includes algorithms that involve persistent queue use would be particularly desirable, but I'll take anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was musing about the following:
  
Would a language version*, where 'in the case of a newtype everything (that's derivable, including with language extensions, like GeneralizedNewTypeDeriving) is automatically derived, unless a manual derivation or a manual instance is defined (or manually suppressed, with a new syntax)' be more ergonomic?
  
I was thinking about this, because I noticed that with quick problems I was often reaching for type instead of newtype. The latter would afford more type safety, but even manually adding the relevant deriving ... clauses felt like a chore for the Advent of Code problems.
  
*) I don't pretend that would still necessarily fall under Haskell2010 + a new extension; maybe this would need to be a hypothetical Haskell derivative, because of semantic changes down the line.
  
Would this even be viable? Would there be undesirable consequences? Would it indeed improve ergonomics, or was that stray thought just a wrong impression?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love emacs as a text editor for programming. But I am trying to build a GTD system using emacs orgmode and calendar and the search lists and calendar displays on emacs always end up looking like a nightmarish wall of text that makes looking at them a pain, a bit too information-dense, making it hard to focus on things. My eyes just bounce around the screen without focusing on anything.
 Is there a way to build similar calendar and search screens on emacs that have instead a lot of white space and separation between items, and focusing in readability rather than on information density?
 I basically would like more structure and less text on screen.
 Some examples:
  
http://doc.norang.ca/block-agenda-nonproject.png
  
This is a task list, but it just presents line after the other of tasks with very little structure and forces you to read through everything to find things rather than having more structure and less crowded text.

Very crowded week-calenday-view with the tasks of one day just piling on top of the tasks of the next day and making it hard to get a clear, temporal view of the view.
 I haven't been able to find any examples with more readable and less crowded views. Has anybody built anything like this? Or is emacs the wrong tool for this and maybe more centered for users that like to see a lot of information at once rather than more structured information? I realize it may be difficult to do what other task and calendar applications do with pure text, so I may be looking at the wrong tool.

 Turns out this doesn't work when called via:
 (ct/with-notmuch-as-compose-mail (compose-mail)) 
 What does work, though, is a macro!
 (defmacro ct/with-notmuch-as-compose-mail (&rest body) `(progn (advice-add 'compose-mail :override #'notmuch-mua-mail) (unwind-protect (progn ,@body) (advice-remove 'compose-mail #'notmuch-mua-mail)))) 
 I don't understand the reason.
 Can anyone explain why the function doesn't do its thing?

I have a function (caesar) that shifts right, e.g. caesar 1 "abc" would result in "bcd", that works as intended.

I would love an explanation on why the shiftLeft functions behave like they do :)

I eventually failed(succeeded, thank to a performance hint of /u/jitwit), because my approach (build graph -> remove all vertices that have a lower neighbour -> count the value of the remaining vertices) relies on neighbours :: Ord a => a -> Graph a -> Set a, which has an inefficient implementation (folds the whole graph, hence my algorithm is at least quadratic.) It still works for the example input tho! :)
 I would be glad about answer or general feedback about the my solution:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to separate my daily tasks with appointments and all from the (embarrasingly) long list of badly maintained tasks -- overdue ones, soon-to-be due ones, and those that are schedule for a past date.
 It was simple enough to hide the overdue stuff from today's timeline:
  (agenda "" ((org-agenda-overriding-header " ") ;; Non-empty string to get empty line (org-agenda-span 'day) (org-agenda-ndays 1) (org-agenda-sorting-strategy (quote ((agenda time-up priority-down tag-up)))) ;; Do not include scheduled, due or overdue items here (org-deadline-warning-days 0) (org-scheduled-past-days 0) (org-deadline-past-days 0) (org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t) (org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-done t) (org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t))) 
 But I cannot get that output to appear elsewhere, e.g. farther down, out of focus. This does display all overdue etc. taks, but also everything with a timestamp for today:
  (agenda "" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Overdue") (org-agenda-time-grid nil) (org org-agenda-remove-timeranges-from-blocks t) (org-agenda-show-all-dates nil) (org-agenda-format-date "") ;; Skip the date (org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil) (org-agenda-span 'day) (org-agenda-ndays 0) (org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done)) ;; Show overdue items (org-scheduled-past-days 999) (org-deadline-past-days 999) ;; Ignore upcoming deadlines (org-deadline-warning-days 0))) 
 How can I get the bottom part to only show overdue etc. tasks, not those that are scheduled for today? 
 Do I have to write a (org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done)) replacement in elisp that filters elements by date, i.e. "not today"? (How? :))

 I have some text with selected phrases marked within asterisks ("*") because org-mode syntax helps to visualize them inside the text, and I'd like to extract those phrases to another buffer.
 As I understand after some searching, one way is to use occur.
 However, I'm struggling (to say it lightly) to find a working regex for this occurrence that is "whatever is between asterisks". I tried txt2regex but no success still...
 Does anyone knows a way to do this; or been in this situation and found a different approach? My lisp/regex fu is very much near the bottom, but I'm happy to learn.
 As always, thanks a lot for your time and attention. :)
 Best regards...
 ​
 PD: I'm thinking about ways to do semantic analysis with org-mode. If anyone's interested on this we can arrange some collaboration. :)

For some reason only recently have I started actually thinking about how I can make my computer-life easier; and Emacs is the one tool which poses least resistence when I try to. 
 I am kinda mad at myself for not doing this sooner, but also very happy that I finally did. I didn't know where else to share this :-)
 In last few days, I have written 2 small bits of Elisp code (which took me embarassingly long to write, but the exercise was very rewarding).
  
First was publishing org subtrees as github issues; so I can stay in org-mode where I am very comfortable thinking and documenting my thoughts, and also push them to Github for colleagues. I can mark an issue as "DONE" and it closes the github issue, or change its content, or labels. 
 And a few minutes ago I wrote a little code to insert my org-roam notes as rust documentation comments
  
It's not much, but it is honest work and I am happy I am finally doing it.

 And even if you have a good answer to the first question, why is there no variable that makes it possible to activate the behaviour 99% of users would except?
 I think naming funktions "org-<key>" is a horrible design, and that is mostly unique for org-mode I know no other package that does that, so it's breaking standard coding practises in emacs, but then also add such bad defaults and no way to configure it in a sane way drives me insane.
 It's a enourmous effort to not use standard keys, but please I am not willing to press some finger destroying C-c C-o, my health is to important to me to want that, and in no case I ever want to behave <return> to jump to the next line when the cursor is on a link. Does really somebody want this behaviour this way? You prefer pressing C-c C-o over <return>?
 Sorry for the rant, I need to make some tea... cheers.
 org-return-follows-link is set to <t> in this example btw, so normally return would open the link, just not in a table.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to investigate text log files a lot. Emacs with auto-revert-tail-mode does the job almost fine, except when there are long lines (JSON/XML dumps, 1-40kb large).
 In that case Emacs lags a lot.
 I use fundamental-mode + add few font-lock-add-keywords by (highlighting for INFO/DEBUG/ERROR & for date/time):
 http://hg.defun.work/dot-emacs/file/tip/mylisp/log4-hi-mode.el
 Even with plain fundamental-mode Emacs is unresponsible. I tried debug on error on C-g and the stacktrace is only native rendering function redisplay_internal.
 Just writing the post I tried so-long-mode instead of fundamental-mode and it is much better but still noticeably lagging. Few extra font-lock-add-keywords in so-long-mode doesn't have huge impact: movement is just a bit slower than without.
 I don't like to open Notepad++ just for log files, though it might be the proper solution...
 Any suggestions on debugging long line issue?
 Could we expect Emacs rendering of long lines improved? 
 I'm with Cygwin Emacs W32 27.2. Almost the same situation with Emacs 27.1 in WSL1 terminal. so-long-mode provides better experience, few font-lock-add-keywords ruin smoothness of movement.
 UPDATE I really need some highlighting for log files (date/time + INFO/DEBUG/ERROR): I expect some help from the tool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 As the title says, I'm trying to move to Emacs 28, from Emacs 27, but I'm having all kinds of weird problems with the packages I use.
 This is my config BTW: https://github.com/croqaz/dotfiles/blob/main/emacs/Emacs.org
 Basically I have "random errors" with random packages.
 First there's IVY and the suite of packages, the error is:
 custom-initialize-reset: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, ../../../../../../.emacs.default/straight/build/ivy/ivy
 I comment ivy, counsel, swiper, ivy-rich, then I get the same error about another package. I comment it and I get another error, etc until I comment: centaur-tabs, doom-modeline, dimmer, which-key, maybe a few more.
 Then I delete ~/.emacs.default/straight/build/ivy and re-enable ivy AND move it immediately after use-package initialization and now it works!
 Then I re-enable all of them, one by one until they all work again!
 It's like one package in there is causing some problems and makes all the other packages after it, to go crazy, that's why I have to move them higher to make it work.
 I tried this so so so many times, that I made it work, but it's a huge pain!
 Anybody else that understands the new version, that can help me?
 Thank you in advance!
 EDIT 1: Other than the problem with packages that I just mentioned, upgrading from Emacs 27 to 28 was painless.
 EDIT 2: Actually I also had the same trouble with yasnippet, company, js2, typescript and LSP packages...

 I can write a simple command line (save-excursion (newline-and-indent)) but I'd love to know if there are any existing ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello again,
 I have a custom keyboard shortcut for moving quicker in VIM (for Emacs I use EVIL) where I hold down CTRL and press HJKL I move faster in the direction.
 Like this:
 ;; Movement changes - BUG: When I release CTRL it still does one last 5 line jump when pressing one of my keys (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-h") (kbd "h5")) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-j") (kbd "j5")) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-k") (kbd "k5")) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-l") (kbd "l5")) 
 However, in EMACS when I use this, it does work. But once I let go off CTRL it does ONE last 5 jump, despite that it should have stopped. It also feels a bit like there is a small delay when doing this.
 Does anyone know a possible solution for this to make it more responsive and NOT have a "last" jump after letting CTRL go.
 Thanks in advance.

 I'm back with some more question for my quest to move over to emacs. This time it's only about HELM (there will be more questions I'm sure of it), but this thread is only for HELM. 
 I have a couple of question I'd love to get some help with. I've tried googling for them, but only found answers that didn't really answer the question, or I couldn't actually understand how the answer worked. :(
  
Is there a way to make helm-find-file to also look in sub-directories? When I googled for this, most people suggested Projectile with helm, but I could not get that working at all. There was no error or such, but it did not search in sub-directories. 
 
Is there anyway to make helm open a new window (or frame, not sure what it is called in emacs) at the center of the screen? There was some old questions here on this reddit for it, but they were 5 years old and then it seems like it wasn't possible. However, I saw on the official documentation that it should be possible. I just can't get it to work for me. I tried using Shackle to solve it as well, and that improved it, but still does not feel as good. 
 
 I believe that was my two helm questions I was mostly struggling with. 
 Thanks in advance

 I want to go through a specific category and want to get those in one single buffer (search or otherwise) with the contents.
 So let's say I have a category country, I want to revisit all the details under this category.
 I am using spacemacs and projectile. A project search or org-roam-find usually lets me search the header but doesn't say whats in the content.
 Options I know of - 
  
Creating an index of country headers and creating its own org-id for org-roam and visiting them manually
 
org-transclusion, where I could include all the same categories in one buffer and that would let me explore the content.
 
 What I am looking for specifically is something that would not require me to make changes like above which would require creating org id for categories which I can use in a buffer. I want a simple approach where a search query would give me what I am looking for in a separate buffer.
 Thanks in advance!

 I was using Emacs to edit some code for an upcoming deadline, I fat fingered something, Emacs exited to terminal. Usually this would be fine, I'd lost a few minutes of work, BUT it appears the files were rolled back to near when I started the Emacs session that terminated (multiple hours)
 I saved tens of times during the session, but nevertheless all my work appears to be gone. Of course it was as I was about to make a commit and push.
 I would really appreciate any insight into what could have possibly happened. My best guess is a shortcut for `git reset --hard`, but even my GitHub repo is more up to date than my local files now (but still at least an hour behind).
 With or without knowing what happened, is there a way to get these files back? Any help would be obviously be appreciated.
 Edit: change first line status to solved

a certain level of familiarity with how GHC generates, manipulates and solves constraints.
In this post, we will attempt to demystify this constraint solving process, as well as review
a few aspects of type-family reduction, to facilitate the development of type-checking plugins.
This post will serve as a reference, when we start writing our own type-checking plugins in Part III.
Don’t worry: you don’t need to know everything before you start writing your own plugins!
It’s only when debugging a type-checking plugin that the rubber hits the road:
a few skills become rather important, such as the ability to understand the different types of constraints,
to read Core (and, in particular, coercion…]]></summary>

 Problem Description
 I'm trying to have the same .org file exported to LaTeX and ox-hugo. I use the template docsy template to export to which uses an alert shortcode to render an alert/info area.
 In LaTeX I use awesomebox to render a similar block.
 The LaTeX output works perfectly when I am using

 Now I want that noteblock to render into the following when using the ox-hugo export:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there guys.
 So, I've recently got the source for Emacs 28.0.90 from https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git and built and installed it following the instructions. More specifically, I ran the following:
  
./autogen.sh
 /configure --with-native-compilation=yes --with-json=yes --with-gnutls=yes --with-x-toolkit=lucid --with-mailutils=yes --with-rsvg=yes
 make -j4
 sudo make install
  
The compilation and install were successful, as well as the Doom install. However when I try to run Emacs I get the following error message:
 error: Invalid hash table rehash size, 1.0
 When I try to run an Emacs client (after successfully starting a daemon) I get a more elaborate error message:
 *ERROR*: Error in a Doom startup hook: server-after-make-frame-hook, doom-init-theme-h, (error "Invalid hash table rehash size" 1.0)
 The same happens when build and install Emacs 27.2 (source also from Savannah), without, of course, the native compilation flag on configure.
 I saw that some Spacemacs users ran into the same problem and submitted this issue. I tried, as suggested there, to run an apt upgrade, but had no success.
 Btw, I'm using Ubuntu 20 and Emacs works fine in the terminal.
 Has anyone ran into the same issue? How can I fix this? 
 Thanks in advance!

 I installed the ts-ls server without issue, and it runs just fine on *.ts files, but it's also running for *.js files. Even stranger is that eslint is running at the same time! Now that both of them are running at the same time for a single file, syntax highlighting doesn't work (although I get warnings and errors underlined as I expect). How do I configure this so that I don't have both running?

Memory Maintenance
Considering notes as proxies for memories, as the size and matrix of the archive grows, more time is spent maintaining existing notes. New notes should be created with abandon. Integrating them into the archive as wholly as I do. Editing them with abandon.
My new note-taking/zettelkasting mantra is: Create and edit with abandon. Trust that magic will happen.

  
I realized that in a few months, let alone years, at this rate most of my time would be spent on the maintenance of memories [notes]. I, as others have found, would be too busy maintaining these memories to use them. 1


What does it mean to "use" a memory? I can use a note's contents, and its idea can be reignited in me. It can spark new and novel ideas.

Would this be accurate? And then the combinatorics product rule also seems at play here. I would appreciate any theoretical explanation of what a list comprehension is about.
 Edit: Looking at the Report I can see and understand the details, but somehow that list of facts in the "Translations" box implies, results in the Cartesian product. I'd like to know how and why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been learning Scala for quite sometime now and found it a nice language. Coming from the background of JavaScript and Python, I found Scala to be a really cool language.
 What I want to ask this community is that how many of you use Scala especially to build microservices using Play Framework... I feel like diving super deep into it but I plan to learn typescript as well... Now I know typescript is definitely a big game player but Scala is something I have been enjoying a bit...
 Is it worth learning Scala in 2022 or should I go with something like golang or Rust? I know it depends on what things I am dealing with but in that scenario javascript and python are answer to almost all my questions Unless performance walks in and now even modern optimized frameworks are handling that well too.
 As a developer, keeping all your love and affection for Java based languages aside do you think it's worth investing in Scala and Play Framework?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear r/scala,
 I am a big fan of SBT that is my main tools for debuging while coding. However, sometimes I can have like 30 errors at once. It is required to debug from first to last since the last errors may be consequent to the firsts one. In this case I have to scroll back to find the start of the error thread which I feel is a lost of time. 
 Do you know a way to reverse this error thread, so that the first errors are shown at the bottom? Or to limit the number of errors shown?
 ​
 Thx

 I visit a dired buffer, all details are hidden as per my config, but after 3 seconds or so, it suddenly shows all my details. Pressing 'g' reverts it to the original setup, only to get overridden again after 3 seconds. I've singled it down to bookmarks+, since de-installation removes this bug.
 I'm posting it in this sub-reddit, since I couldn't find a github for bookmarks+.

 Doom, for some reason isn't replicating this functionality. I see that in my JS file it's using rjsx-indent-line as the indent function, and when I call that via elisp, I see the expected behavior, but when I repeatedly press tab, the line indents further than it should.
 Anybody know how to turn that off?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I am looking at something similar to what other IDEs support, and that is searching for a Classes(Java, Cpp etc) within the included libraries and the project itself through maven(for Java) or Cmake (for Cpp) for example. It is clear that the language servers know about them, because they are able to properly find and import them, but i would like to be able to explicitly search for them by name (like C-x C-f).
 Is there a generic lsp feature / is that part of the spec , or each server is different in that aspect. Any help is appreciated, thanks !
 Another additional question - how does the language server access those symbols, say the Java language server, is it doing that through maven's m2 repository or does it keep a stash on its own.

 been trying to solve this issue for quite a while now (google, posts). I swear, I did everything short of asking it here.
 Different terminal emulators as well (Terminal, iTerm2, kitty). I am on macOS.
 I would love to use my arrow keys in the non gui version of Emacs but they seem to be weirdly mapped:
 ​
 UP:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then A
 (GUI Emacs: evil-previous-line)
 
 Down:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then B
 (GUI Emacs: evil-next-line)
 
 Right:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then C
 (GUI Emacs: evil-forward-char)
 
 Left:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then C
 (GUI Emacs: evil-backward-char)
 ​
 ​
 I have tried few remapping by suggestions that do not work at all – currently:
 ​
 (unless (display-graphic-p)
 (progn
 (defvar arrow-keys-map (make-sparse-keymap) "Keymap for arrow keys")
 (define-key esc-map "O" arrow-keys-map)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map "A" 'previous-line)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map "B" 'next-line)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map "C" 'forward-char)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map "D" 'backward-char)))
 ​
 Nope. Doesn't work.
 HELP.

Mostly because I do common lisp development, but I have 2 relative big issues regarding my workflow. First, on every project I have a script that builds tmux session with corresponding services running (redis, postgresdb, vim, custom services, etc) I guess I can simulate this using a elisp file on each project? Is that possible? . Second, I use a lot M-x compile command, but my root keeps moving on each window. It's different than vim, that the root is where I executed vim. On the other hand, SLIME is really cool, and I'm really eager to use org-mode more when I solve this 2 issues. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[File links break all the time, for instance after reorganize your directory structure. This can take many time to fix broken link manually. I need a solution to prevent all file reference in my org-agenda-files are broken.
 My current solution to prevent the issue is to use hardlink in org-agenda-files ```
 assume I want add /a/b/c.org into emacs variable org-agenda-files
 mkdir ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files
 create hardlink of c.org in dir org-agenda-files
 ln /a/b/c.org ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org 
 add ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org to emacs variable org-agenda-files
 ```
 However, this solution has some limit. For instance, - the absolute path of "c.org" become ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org. So its relative link are broken.
 LinkTek propose a much better solution: https://linktek.com/do-this-one-trick-and-never-worry-about-broken-file-links-again/
  
LinkTek creates an additional association between the parent file and each of its child files. LinkFixer Advanced uses that secondary association to quickly and automatically fix all the links that get broken by whatever changes someone makes to your files.
  
What solution you use for the problem of broken link? Exist an implementation of solution proposed by LinkTek for org mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by recent, well-known articles on Embark and on Avy, I've started testing Embark over the past few days - and it's already turning into the interface I always wanted and only sort of knew I needed. While it's extremely useful out-of-the-box, I've already found a few cases where I would want to use it but can't, because it doesn't understand the construct at point. Examples:
  
Org mode timestamps - to provide operations like activate/inactivate, change, pop calendar to that date, bump by repeater, etc.
 
Org mode headlines - pretty much everything you can do on those, that Org mode has bound to countless weird keys. Including "speed commands", most of which could work without quitting the Embark "prompter", the way e.g. navigating to next/prev symbol works.
 
Org mode tables - embark-cycle could be able to switch between cell, row, column, whole table (perhaps also stopping at "rowgroup", "column group" and "subtable", which would be rectangular areas that are bound by hlines and column group markers) - each of those would have its own contextual commands available. For example, "eval formula", so one doesn't have to remember reference syntax and how many times to press C-u before pressing C-c =.
 
Syntactic elements and expressions in programming language modes, allowing for e.g. language-specific actions.
 
 From the looks of it, it's not that hard to write any - the tricky bit being target classifiers. I'm going to take a stab at adding some classifiers and action keymaps for things I commonly interact with - but I'd like to avoid repeating work that might already be done better. Hence my question: are there any "extension packages" that enable Embark to recognize more target types? Or, are any of you already using hand-written ones (and if yes, can you share them)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have all seen Emacs be described as so many different things: a text editor, not just a text editor, an operating system, a Lisp interpreter, and a *million other things.
 Describing what Emacs is can be super difficult, as it is different things to different people. Some use it for programming or general writing, some for organisation, project management, email, web browsing, controlling media, and a **million more things. Basically, people use Emacs for whatever they want, which is fantastic! 
 This makes it difficult to describe what exactly Emacs is to people outside our friendly little circle. Other editors can be described nearly completely with a short familiar phrase. Vim is an efficient text editor, VSCode is a powerful modern IDE, Vi is a last resort. But Emacs doesn't have a consistent and universally agreeable short description. 
 My question is, what is Emacs to you? How would you describe it succinctly to someone who has heard about it, but not sure what all the fuss is about? 
 My humble submission would be: "the whatever you want text interface."
 *Mild exaggeration, but you get the picture
 ** Under exaggeration :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NOTE: I usually use emacs in the CLI, not in the GUI.
 I found out about emacs some months back. When I initially tried out emacs; it felt complicated to use. After I practiced emacs over time; I started to like emacs.
  
I could use lynx inside emacs to form a psuedomultitab browser. Eventually I learned that emacs has a built-in browser eww. I favored that browser over lynx.
 
It was nice to be able to containerize workspaces, like for programming, school work, miscellaneous stuff, and just general browsing without having to deal with floating windows.
 
 I have Autism and ADHD; emacs helps with dealing with Autism, because it does not give much lack of sensory information; emacs is hyperresponsive, unlike VSCode, so it does not hurt my eyes when I try to do heavy-load tasks.
 emacs also helps with ADHD, since I can easily organize stuff with org-mode. I can also easily navigate buffers without a pointing device; I am uncomfortable with pointing devices (mouses and touchpads), despite using them for 11 years. Pointing devices seem to really mess with me and I can't control them as well (as I can with a keyboard).
 EDIT: My only complaint is that I wish I could display images in CLI emacs, like running viu on links to images after eww finishes loading. That complaint is not a criticism on emacs itself though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I'm doing Python web development in emacs using lsp-mode(I want to switch over to eglot-mode eventually when the pull-requests get pushed and html/css/js work automatically with elgot-mode, so keep this in mind) as the IDE for the Python and HTML files, which is working great. But when doing Jinja/Django specific syntax(for example in an HTML file), the auto-completion does not work? Is there an lsp-mode/eglot-mode for this to be used with use-package?
 If not then is there a way to declare web-mode in a use-package, where this functionality can be set, in which the corresponding Jinja/Django engine is activated based on a corresponding hook?
 I'd prefer to stick with the .py and .html extensions, but if that's not possible, the I could try out extensions like .djhtml to be used in the web-mode hook in the declared use-package.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use ebib and citar. Both are awesome, but have different defaults when creating notes files for bibliographic entries. I wanted to unify them (so that my notes would always be of the same format). So I defined a wrapper function:
 (defun my/citar-ebib-notes-format-wrapper (key _entry _filepath) "Wrapper so that citar's notes function can inherit from ebib's. 
 Passes KEY to ebib--notes-fill-template', along with the value ofebib--cur-db' if defined, or the first item of `ebib-preload-bib-files' if not. _ENTRY and _FILEPATH are ignored." (require 'ebib-notes) (if-let ((cell (ebib--notes-create-new-note key (or ebib--cur-db (car ebib-preload-bib-files))))) (progn (display-buffer (car cell)) (goto-char (cdr cell)))))
 This only works while ebib is running. While it's not running I get an error message format-spec: Invalid format character: ‘%T, which is strange, because the formatting seems to rely on ebib-notes-template-specifiers, which I don't change, and which is initialised in ebib-notes.el (so should be available when the body of the function runs). Changing the notes template variable so that it doesn't include %T helps, and iterating on this reveals that the formatter errors for all specifiers except %K, which it handles fine. I'm very confused.
 I've tried everything I can think of to get this to work, to no avail. What's going on? Any help greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just today I startted getting the following errors after using straight to pull the most recent version of org.
 Error (use-package): org/:config: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-element-cache-reset [2 times]
 Error (use-package): evil-embrace/:catch: Symbol’s value as variable is void: org-org-menu
 WARNING: No org-loaddefs.el file could be found from where org.el is loaded.
 You need to run "make" or "make autoloads" from Org lisp directory
 The only notable parts of my config related to installing org are as follows:
 (require 'package) (setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("nongnu" . "https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/"))) 
 and
 (straight-use-package 'org) (straight-use-package '(org-contrib :type git :host github :repo "emacsmirror/org-contrib")) 
 I Know there have been some recent changes with org mode installation and I have seen some posts here but I have gotten confused and can't seem to figure out what I am doing wrong. Notably, I have not changed anything in my config lately that I would imaging would have anything to do with installing org....
 ​
 EDIT: I take it back. 
 I did recently add 
 :hook (org-mode . turn-on-org-cdlatex)
 and removing that line does seem to fix things but I have no idea why. 
 Any help would be most appreciated.

 What does it mean when I start its daemon:

 ?
 I also feel that ~/.emacs.d/init.el isn't executed when I start the emacs, because I added (desktop-save-mode 1) in it, and when I exit and start emacs daemon again, it doesn't reopen the files that were opened when I exited it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[data Letters = A | B | C deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded, Enum, Show) instance (Eq a, Ord a, Bounded a, Enum a) => Enum [a] where succ = reverse . succ' . reverse where succ' :: [a] -> [a] succ' (x:xs) | x < (maxBound :: a) = (succ x) : xs | x == (maxBound) && xs /= [] = (minBound :: a) : (succ' xs) class (Eq a, Ord a, Enum a, Bounded a) => Buildable a where build :: a -> a -> [a] build start end = reverse $ build' start end [] where build' :: a -> a -> [a] -> [a] build' x y l | x >= (minBound :: a) && x <= y && x < (maxBound :: a) = build' (succ x) y l++[x] | x >= (minBound :: a) && x <= y && x == (maxBound :: a) = l++[x] | otherwise = l instance Buildable Letters 
 I have defined succ so that it can be applied to all permutation of [Letters] with a ordered sequence like this:
 succ [A,A,A] = [A,A,B] succ [A,A,B] = [A,A,C] succ [A,A,C] = [A,B,A] ... succ [C,C,B] = [C,C,C] -- succ [C,C,C] is not defined 
 build in Buildable is given the start and end value, it builds a ordered list of every element in the set including start and end:
 build A B = [A,B] build B C = [B,C] build A C = [A,B,C] 
 ​
 How do I apply Buildable on [Letters] such that I can call build like this:
 build [A] [B] = [[A],[B]] build [A,A] [B,B] = [[A,A],[A,B],[B,A],[B,B]] build [A,A,A] [A,A,C] = [[A,A,A],[A,A,B],[A,A,C]] build [B,B,C] [B,C,C] = [[B,B,C],[B,C,A],[B,C,B],[B,C,C]] 
 It seems like I have to define what maxBound and minBound is for [Letters] if I do instance Buildable [a]. How do I do that?

 Endless bridges the gap between Cats Effect and Akka Cluster Sharding.

 (defun my/dired-do-flagged-delete (&optional arg) (interactive "P") (let ((delete-by-moving-to-trash (xor arg delete-by-moving-to-trash))) (dired-do-flagged-delete))) (defun my/dired-do-delete (&optional arg) (interactive "P") (let ((delete-by-moving-to-trash (xor arg delete-by-moving-to-trash))) (dired-do-delete))) 
 All I have to do now is bind these functions to x and D in dired-mode-map
 Of course after that, the default reaction to prefixes is lost. Personally I don't care, because I never used it. Others might think differently about that.

 I'm having an issue where emacs seems to freeze randomly on me (with no error message viewable from the GUI). It doesn't seem to be related to a particular command (most recently it happened while I was just navigating the cursor around a buffer). Is there anything I can do / try to get a more helpful error message?
 Sorry if that's a silly question, I'm new here.
 Some info about my setup in case it's relevant:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title may not be the appropriate way of solving this issue but I feel it may be a way to the solution.
 I have a function that takes in something and returns a list of that something changed in multiple ways.
 The way it is changed is by checking the input against many if statements, the if statements only differ by the fact the values within them increment up and down. However, I don't think this is a good solution to this.
 The way that it is changed shows a pattern so I think I should be able to solve it recursively but I can't figure out how.
 I will give an example of a situation similar to mine, this function is useless and is just an arbitrary example of my situation:
 function :: Shape -> [Shape]
 function shape@(Triangle sidea sideb sidec) =
  [if length sidec <= (7) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (2) then changeSideC shape (2) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec <= (6) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (3) then changeSideC shape(3) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec <= (5) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (4) then changeSideC shape (4) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec <= (4) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (5) then changeSideC shape (5) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec <= (3) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (6) then changeSideC shape (6) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec <= (2) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (7) then changeSideC shape (7) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec <= (1) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (8) then changeSideC shape (8) else Triangle [][][]]
 I have put the recurring pattern in brackets so you can see what I am talking about. How would I reduce this function down so that it would work even if you made the numbers much larger? Is there a recursive way of doing this?
 I feel that this is possible but I am at a loss on how to implement this.
 This is my first post so go easy on me if I'm missing something.

 I am a PhD student in Earth Sciences currently trying to switch all my Python programming from Spyder to emacs (because emacs is just all I need). 
 I am pretty sure more people than enough tried to make emacs as close as Spyder for me to find somewhere an el file ready to use with the Spyder theme and just the few useful things I need (basically an iPython console in another window, autocompletion, black formatting on save, cell highlighting and few other things)... However I can't find anything. Thefore I'm pretty sure I am not looking at the right places. Do you know where I could find such a file? Or at least part of it (like the spyder theme)?
 Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently using lsp-mode with Haskell in Doom Emacs. Unfortunately, when I try to open my Xmonad config in Emacs, my memory usage spikes due to the Haskell language server(takes apprx. 1.8GB) and my screen is filled with recommendations as in the image. 
 I wish to remove the gray inline requests and only keep the light-bulb requests on the right. I have looked through this page: https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/how-to-turn-off/ but I cannot find out how to remove the inline requests. Any help with this is greatly appreciated. I have also noticed that the inline requests are actually duplicated, which is even more confusing. 
 For the high memory usage, I don't even know where to begin with reducing it. It's so high that it completely eclipses the memory usage of the rest of Emacs. 
 Thanks in advance for any help

I just learned these new functions, map, filter, foldr and foldl, but i cant seem to understand when to use fold and what both of them do, in which way i want to apply them, specially with more complex functions associated, i can understand the fold (+) for example. 
 Can anyone elucidate me about these functions, im kind of stuck here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a data scientist, I work in python with pandas for manipulating data on a daily basis. I love emacs but there is one feature that makes me open up Pycharm every day instead and that is its “sciview”, which displays dataframes in a “spreadsheet” manner which really helps when debugging/exploring.
 EIN has a function to do exactly this and visualize the dataframe in SES mode: https://github.com/tkf/emacs-ipython-notebook/blob/d62dc59869d436385efa940ba20a737bb8b9e5fd/lisp/ein-pytools.el#L222 . It relies on a jupyter kernel to retrieve the data, I would like to adapt that to dap-mode (or any standard python process accessible through a REPL) but my elisp-fu is way too poor.
 Has anybody here solved this problem before?

 in the context of this comment https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/issues/732#issuecomment-986043891 from the same ticket.
 So then, my question would be, how would link a cider session? My guess is that the (cider-completion-get-context) value isn't returning the cider session.

 Is there a way to make lsp-ui-doc display documentation in the same way it does in the first case, everywhere? Sorry if this has been asked before, I couldn't find anything about it while googling. Here is my settings file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to know what you people do in these situations.
 Namely, I'd like to have coherent and consistent keybindings accross different modes, and I'd like to have this information quite visible in one place so that I can generally decide for all prog-modes or text modes what are the best keybindings for me.
 Right now I have defined a macro that kind of does this for me, a minimal example for markup languages would be
 emacs-lisp (defcustom ale-markup-mode-maps '(:org org-mode-map :latex latex-mode-map :tex TeX-mode-map :md markdown-mode-map) "Maps to be added to the markup ale mode" :group 'ale) 
 Here I define in a plist the maps that I am interested in and the keyword is important. Later I can define the keybindings and I can override the functions for different maps according to the keywords I defined in the plist above.
 ```emacs-lisp (ale-define-key normal ale-markup-mode-maps "C-i" (:md markdown-cycle :all org-cycle) ;; images "C-c C-i C-l" org-latex-preview "C-c C-i C-t" (:all org-toggle-inline-images :md markdown-toggle-inline-images) "C-c C-i C-i" #'org-redisplay-inline-images
 ;; references "C-c C-r C-d" papis-extract-citations-into-dblock "C-c C-r C-i" papis-org-ref-insert-citation-from-query "C-c C-r C-o" (:all org-ref-insert-cite-link :tex reftex-citation :latex reftex-citation) "C-c C-r C-r" (:all org-ref-insert-ref-link :tex reftex-label :latex reftex-label)) ```
 How would you do this, is there a canonical way of doing this that I am missing out?
 Just to be clear, I don't mean defining a minor mode where to have a set of keybindings, because the keybinding will be different depending on the mode that I'm in, but if I'm in org or markdown I want semantically =C-i= to mean cycling, but the function is different.
 Thanks people!

 Is there some way to set this in the file's Org headers instead?

 Like I've written in another post about Omnisharp and LSP, I'm back to trying to use Emacs as my main GUI.

This is where Emacs comes in. I'm setting up Emacs to be close to VIM (but not using SpaceMacs or DoomEmacs since they are incredibly slow on Windows, especially compared to "Vanilla Emacs"), with EVIL and some other helping functions. I have some beginner questions I'd love to get help with to be happy inside of Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find Haskell an amazing language but I have difficulties integrating it into my daily workflow. I work as a professional programmer and do Python all day long.
 I started the "Learn you a Haskell" book to tease my brain and learn to approach problems from a different angle. And I have learned a lot and I think my Python code has benefited from it.
 But I got stuck at the Monad chapter and lost interest. But it's still in the back of my mind to get back to it.
 However, the biggest roadblock I am facing is that I can't seem to find something useful to do with Haskell. Probably due to the lack of my knowledge/experience in that language.
 But I can't bring myself to write Haskell at work as I would be the only one being able to maintain the code (no other Haskellers around).
 So I am turning to you folks: Do you have any ideas of writing something that will end up being something useful? Maybe some starters for implementing a HTTP/REST layer between a JS-Frontend and a database? Or something else I would love to play around with (but I'm not sure whether it's even possible): Writing a Python extension in Haskell, or, if that's not doable, a .so shared library which could be called from other code so I could use Python's ctypes module (not sure if that is even possible either).
 Any ideas? Tips?

Recently, however, I have met quite a few developers that I respect who are using eglot and say that it is less buggy than lsp-mode.
 I have found that many of the bugs I have encountered while using emacs have been root caused to lsp-mode and lsp-ui. I am wondering if more experienced emacs users have an opinion on these two different packages (or sets of packages in the case of lsp-mode, dap-mode, lsp-ui). I am interested to hear about feature parity and stabability - and also using eglot when editing remote files with tramp.
 Also as an aside, it would be great to have an LSP client package added in the standard distribution of emacs.

 I'm again (tried this before but ended up leaving this since I couldn't get it working) trying to use Emacs as my "IDE". I'm a evil user, but I don't believe that has anything to do with my current problem. 
 I'm trying to get LSP working in emacs. Specifically Omnisharp with Unity3D. 
 I have installed lsp-mode and the Omnisharp server through the lsp-install command. When I look for the installed servers it also states that it is installed. However, when I try to use Emacs with my Unity project I get no auto-completion for anything related to Unity things (e.g. GameObject, Transform, etc.). I only get auto-completion for my own variables and such within my script. 
 I get this error message: 
 "Warning (lsp-mode): Unable to calculate the languageId for buffer ‘acPlMovement.cs’. Take a look at ‘lsp-language-id-configuration’. The ‘major-mode’ is fundamental-mode"
 It also says something about "(Special LSP[Disconnected] company)". 
 I did read this page, but didn't find that I should need any special setup for the omnisharp server. - https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/installation/
 I assume I'm missing something in my setup, but I haven't been able to google what I'm missing or what the problem could be. 
 Could anyone here help me with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. I'm a Haskell dev, but I use Kotlin in my day job. 
 For those not familiar, Jetpack Compose is a compiler plugin for Kotlin which allows for a declarative React/VDOM style of UI programming by composing so-called "composable functions" (which is funny to me as a Haskell dev, because what is a function if not composable?) to build up the UI.
 The kicker is, at compile-time, these composable functions are eliminated -- and (as I understand it) compiled to some imperative code that updates the UI appropriately in a reactive manner as it's inputs change.
 Svelte works similarly, but for JavaScript.
 So in other words, you get something that looks a lot like a VDOM/React style UI -- but without the overhead of an actual VDOM!
 This is a fascinating idea to me, and I'd love to learn more about how such approaches work -- but at least in terms of compiler/DSL/PL-type features (basically anything that manipulates an AST), I find Haskell far easier to understand and read. So I was wondering if anyone has implemented anything similar in Haskell (or even a related language like Purescript).
 I know there's gi-gtk-declarative and Halogen (on the Purescript side) -- and while these are both excellent libraries for declarative UI programming, as far as I know, both of them are implemented via a VDOM -- not with a compilation step.
 Does anyone know of anyone who's attempted such a compile-time approach to declarative UIs in Haskell?

I am starting with Python and hopefully implement it for other languages when I successfully implement this. The parser part is easy, but the problem is that most of the file is not relevant and I want to ignore it. Is there way to jump to the part of the file/text that is potentially parseable or is relevant to the task.
  There is some text that I don't care about... ... <actual text that I want to parse and insert some texts before or after> ... Maybe more irrelevant text. 
 I tried using getPosition and setPosition but it didn't behave like I expected, maybe I am using them wrong?
 Any advice would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
I’ve been lurking for a while now but thought it was time to post and say hello. I’m a PhD student in Archaeology, and I stumbled upon the world of Zettelkasten while trying to find a better way to make notes at the start of my PhD.
I’ve jumped around quite a few different tools over the past year but there’s always been something that’s got in the way - apps were either too bloated or complicated or too buggy, or in some cases had awful font rendering.
My most recent favourite was iA Writer, and I think I was so attracted to it because I’ve learnt that I want something simple, minimal and distraction free.
For me, most options people seem to be using have too many bells and whistles and I want something that just gets out the way and leaves me with my text. iA Writer fit this bill perfectly but I found moving between notes and linking too cumbersome.
SO I’ve purchased The Archive this week and I absolutely love it! Just as minimal and “clean” but with ease of navigation built in.
I’m still in the process of getting familiar with The Archive but it seems to do everything I want it to. Before I was using subfolders but I’m thinking that I’m happy to lean in and just put all my notes in a single folder, and use tools like structure notes and other forms of hypertext to maintain connections and groupings where necessary.
The only thing I’m currently unsure of is how much to keep in my Zettelkasten. For example, my primary use case is academic writing, but I also want to keep notes relating to more personal topics of interest, e.g. notes about personal development, note taking, language-learning, etc. I’m not sure whether to combine everything or whether to keep my other interests separate.
Anyways, looking forward to learning more from you all and getting to grips with the method and The Archive in greater depth. Thanks for all the wisdom I’ve already gained from the forums!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/contextual/conversions.html and I'm left with some questions. In Scala 2, we create a companion object, e.g.,
 object Fraction { def IntToFraction(n: Int): Fraction = Fraction(n) } class Fraction(numer: Int, demon: Int = 1) { private val gcd = // TODO: Calculate GCD(numer, denom) val numerator = numer / gcd val denominator = denom / gcd def apply def +(addend:Fraction) // etc. } 
 Is a companion object unnecessary in Scala 3?
 I could just try it on my other computer as I have Scala 3 on that one, but I would still appreciate some pointers on this.

I've tracked the issue down to `compile-goto-error` and then `next-error-internal` in simple.el, but I can't seem to find the relevant code. I've tried a few configuration options, including `next-error-recenter` (which seems to just stop recentering/scrolling on the destination buffer) but can't seem to figure it out.
 Any advice would be much appreciated, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been mostly happy keeping no emacs custom-file using Drew Adams' cus-edit+. This means that all my customization is kept in my use-package statements, so it is fully reproducible. The only downside in my year+ of doing this has been that sometimes I get warnings or "buttons" in messages that pop up, such as "disable showing" in a pop-up warning, and I don't know how to "disable" it permanently. Normally it would put a line into my custom file and I could use that to update my :custom sections in my init.el. Now, though, it saves it in running "state" if I click the (eg) "Disable showing" button, but I have no idea what I should write to make it permanently remember not to show that thing.
 Any solutions? How can maintain no custom file, but still capture the code that would be written by interface interactions like errors "disable showing", or certain customizer settings, etc?

 docker exec -it keycloak sh && extit || exit the input device is not a TTy. If you are using mintty try prefixing the command with `winpty` helm-M-x-execute-command: Tramp failed to connect. If this happens repeatedly, try `M-x tramp-cleanup-this-connection`

I checked that the test' function does indeed get called, I triple checked my guards etc. Any help would be much appreciated :)

 If I schedule something in an org-journal entry for a date in the future, the file is created. But there are no carryover items at the time. 
 When items do carry over, the file is already created, so they don’t get added to the existing file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all
 We are thrilled to announce the release of Ogma, a new open-source NASA tool, written in Haskell, to generate hard-realtime C runtime monitoring applications from high-level specifications.
 Ogma takes the output of existing tools, like NASA's requirements elicitation tool FRET [2], and produces monitors in Copilot [3], a runtime verification language that can be compiled to hard-realtime C99.
 Ogma is also able to produce monitoring applications for NASA's Core Flight System (cFS), which can be compiled alongside existing applications to flag requirement violations. 
 FRET requirement being monitored inside the XPlane flight simulator by taking the code generated by Ogma and making it accessible to the simualtor via a custom on-screen plugin
 Ogma takes high-level specifications produced from requirements by NASA's FRET tool and converts them into Copilot runtime monitors that can be converted into hard-realtime C99 code.
 This is research software (Class E) and it has not been certified for use in aircraft or UAVs. We are currently using it for upcoming experiments at NASA Langley.
 We'd like to also take this opportunity to publicly thank the team that creates BNFC, for their tool, their response to technical questions during the development of Ogma, and for accommodations made to help us speed up our release process.
 If you have any issues, feel free to open a ticket in the github repo directly.
 Happy haskelling,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest problem is the difficulty using programming tool on the code, because the code is wrapped in org file, programming tools can't access to code.
 In order to integrate org babel code to programming tools ecosystem. 2 possible solutions: - import/export solution, like myuhe/org-gcal.el. For instance, we compile org file to .java, and recompile .java to .org. But this solution has a lot of drawbacks. When recompile .java to .org, a new org file is generated by the compiler, we lose the data organization, and all the info that are not exported of original org file. - bi-directional synchronisation solution like dengste/org-caldav. For instance, only code block of org file is exported to .java file, and all modification on java file will repercut on org code block. This is the best solution for the problem.
 However, I don't see either of the 2 solutions used in the org mode literary programming tutorials. But they are used to integrate org agenda to another calendar ecosystem. Is there a reason?

For example, these two features are missing: - Highlighting of cited text with different cases. - The ability to display attachments in a buffer using gnus-mime-copy-part.
 Is there a way to configure notmuch to have this gnus functionality?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You've almost certainly all heard this sentence before. As a new Emacs user and someone who does want to really get to know Emacs, I want to hear about all the pros and cons I have heard so far, from you guys. I'm really surprised how friendly this community is. I've never seen a more friendly online group ever. 
 I am the guy that asked about "Emacs-Lisp functions beneath the surface" a few days ago. 
 Anyway, I was watching this video and there is something that caught my attention more than anything else. And that is the sentence at 14:00 : 
  
" Emacs is 12 MB, core with none of the Lisp extensions." 
  
Is this really true? Why is Emacs considered a bloat Software, in some communities, then? 12 MB doesn't seem much. 
 And what do people mean when they say that Emacs is bloat or memory intensive? Is the core bloated?
 There are definitely people that are more for debating than actually addressing problems or having a discussion. So I'm really curious, is it that there is actually a real reason they are saying it, or is it just that it's a common "saying" of Vim users and users who find Emacs "too difficult"? 
 Or is it that an average user uses so many packages that Emacs becomes CPU and/or memory intensive? 
 What do you consider a bloat software?
 Also, even the guy in the video said that at 18:20: 
  
"All these things that people have said about Emacs having a big footprint and being memory intensive blah blah blah it's all true" 
  
I would love to hear your perspective on this commonly brought up "contention".

I was wondering if anyone else is using Emacs to write Python 3.10 code, specifically using the new match and case keywords. When I try to use them, Emacs doesn't recognize them as keywords, and so doesn't understand that it should indent the following lines.
 If I understand correctly, this is handled by python.el. Has there been any movement on adding support for the new keywords? And where could I go to find out, follow progress, or possibly contribute?
 For reference, I'm using Emacs 27.2 and the built-in python.el. Thank you!

It works well except that when exporting to ODT or even Org-mode with chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl as the CSL style I get a reference without date. So for citation [cite:@fabianTimeOtherHow2014 p. 7;] I get:
 For ODT 
  
[1]Johannes Fabian, Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object (Columbia University Press, n.d.), 7
  
for Org-mode
  
[fn::Johannes Fabian, /Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object/ (Columbia University Press, n.d.), 7]
  
As you can see, in both cases the date is missing. As per this reply to this issue on citeproc-org's Github it seems that the date field is not a recognized bibtex field. If I change manually in my .bib file a particular entry from date to year then I do get the correct reference.
 My question is: how can I solve this issue without changing the date field of all the entries in my .bib file to year?
 This is what I have at the top of my org file:

I know the masters program uses languages like C, C++, Java, Python, etc so I'm wondering how much of a gap I'll be left with to transfer the knowledge I gain to implementing in Haskell. Is there a better roadmap to learning more advanced topics and applying them in Haskell or other pure functional languages than enrolling in a masters program? It's fully online so courses only, no thesis. Should I get a job doing something within reach and self-study these concepts and trying to implement in Haskell? I'm still a novice in Hasekll but feel as though I'm falling behind already as the trend towards pure functional languages seems to be accelerating. Should I try to enroll in a graduate program that is focused on functional languages like the one at Tsukuba University?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evaluating (window-text-width) for a fullscreen window returns 238, which indicates that 238 columns of characters should be able to be displayed on one line. However, using count-words-region, I can see that I can actually only fit 234 characters on a line without it causing wrapping (I'm using global-visual-line-mode, although this problem persists when it's off). This causes problems with any functionality that tries to right align content - for instance, org-agenda will try to align content so that the last character in a heading's tags is on column 238 (i.e. on the right side of the screen), but since column 238 is actually beyond the right side of the screen, the tags end up on the following visual line. Instead of
 * TODO my task a :@home: * TODO my task b :@work: 
 I end up with
 * TODO my task a :@home: * TODO my task b :@work: 
 ...which is significantly less information dense and generally uglier. I was content to set org-agenda-tags-column to 0, but I've recently picked up ledger, and this issue has also started messing up the formatting in its reports. This also happens regardless of how I split windows - if I split vertically, window-text-width reports a width of 118, but I can actually only fit 114 columns. Has anyone run into this before, or have tips for where to start looking? This seems like such a finicky, low-level thing I don't have much hope - especially since I haven't futzed around with any obvious culprits like font settings.

 The reason I ask is that terminal only , there are problems displaying graphics e.g. matplotlib plots. So my workaround for this is Jupyter lab: jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=9090. My question is… is there any way to view plots in emacs given my setup? I’d prefer to have freedom to use emacs org mode and render plots than be forced to use Jupiter lab notebooks .
 Does anybody know, if possible, how I can display images in emacs using cloud vm?
 Thanks

  echo -e "1\n2" | runghc main.hs 2>/dev/null 1 2  (instead of 1\n1\n).
 Does this happen because IO String is a monad around a reader handle (stdin in this case), and so multiple binds on the same value cause successive reads on the handle?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What to call these? Patterns like Ap themselves follow a meta-pattern which specifies applicative lifting where the operations all have the form opn = liftAn opn.. give or take lifting constants. Assume simplified classes and liftA0 = pure
 instance (Applicative f, Semigroup a) => Semigroup (Ap f a) where (<>) = liftA2 (<>) instance (Applicative f, Monoid a) => Monoid (Ap f a) where mempty = liftA0 mempty instance (Applicative f, Bounded a) => Bounded (Ap f a) where minBound = liftA0 minBound maxBound = liftA0 maxBound instance (Applicative f, Num a) => Num (Ap f a) where (+) = liftA2 (+) (-) = liftA2 (-) (*) = liftA2 (*) abs = liftA abs .. fromInteger = liftA0 . fromInteger 
 The pattern is somewhat simple but with no way to capture it, except by repeating it for every algebra. The instance head cannot be a type variable
 instance (Applicative f, cls a) => cls (Ap f a) where ?? 
 What would such a solution even look like? I don't want to get distracted by if the instance are all lawful, just capturing this meta-pattern the emerges. 
  
A generic representation for type classes to parallel Generic for datatypes. 
 It can be implemented as a GHC plugin, like Evoke (blog, reddit, reddit)
 
Or created on the fly by GHC, which is privy to the internal structure of type classes

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So most of my work, I have used hell lot of JavaScript and Python and a littlebit of TypeScript. In my new Job, I am supposed to learn Scala and I already had a hard time understanding Generics and all such concepts. Additionally the functional way of Scala, stuff like accumulator based recursion and tail recursion, lazy variables also got my head spinning.
 I am planning to Dive even deeper into this but I wanted to know from all of you that should I rather go and learn Java or TypeScript in depth before going to Scala? Actually I don't have a lot of time grasping all of the concepts and so I began with basics of Scala and till now my experience is neither too good nor too bad.
 ​
 As of 2021 (or we can say almost 2022), what would be your advise for a beginer with statically typed language and how should I go about learning Scala so that I get a good grip in it?
 ​
 Additionally, when we say Java there are two things: 1. Pure Programming Side of Java, 2. JVM and of-course here I am not referring to the JVM side as I understand, since Scala anyways runs on JVM, that's a necessary thing. What I need to know is that do you need to go through Java Programming or any such language before getting Scala really well?

Assessing Haskell by Nyeogmi
I considered trying to assess Haskell without mentioning my own opinions at all. I don’t think that’s fair or possible, nor do I think that would lead people to an accurate assessment of Haskell.
Fallback of actions by Magnus Therning
In a tool I’m writing I want to load a file that may reside on the local disk, but if it isn’t there I want to fetch it from the web. Basically it’s very similar to having a cache and dealing with a miss, except in my case I don’t populate the cache.

 I have been asked for the PDF of my org-reveal presentation.
 I'm aware I can use the:
 ?print-pdf 
 and
 Ctrl+P 
 Method in my browser to generate a PDF, but that doesn't do what I need.
 It doesn't retain the formatting of the presentation. It simply displays a small amount of black text on a white blank page. This looks unprofessional and is hard to read.
 Am I missing something obvious here?

 The error is

 so I tried putting `or` there instead but I just get another error.
 Am I missing an import?
 At the top of my file I have

 and I swear I have been following the book line by line so did not miss any other imports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, is anyone using org-ql with a big number of files, probably in combination with org-roam, instead of say deft? How well does it scale to thousands of files? I know that org-agenda can get pretty sluggish around a thousand files, but it's my understanding that org-ql is faster, although maybe not that faster. Any experience? Thanks!
 NOTE: this is not for TODOs but for general search, I've seen workarounds that exclude files not containing tasks nor projects from the search, but that's not what I'm interested in, I want to search every file and ideally using more structured queries like those of org-ql (vs deft).
 EDIT: I've been experimenting a bit with this:
  
I cloned this big nonsense ZK which is designed to stress-test note-taking apps.
 I converted all notes from md to org using pandoc: for f in *; do pandoc --to org "$f" > "${f%%.md}.org"; done. Not really necessary for what it follows, except for the file extension part, but anyway.
 Now, searching for some text with ripgrep is very fast, as expected, for example with 56/10000 matches:
  
```
  
time rg -c "to queer noises" *.org | wc -l 56
  
real 0m0.317s user 0m0.195s sys 0m0.316s ```
  
Now with org-ql the same search setting org-directory to be the ZK folder, requiring no grouping and just random order, and doing a (regexp "to queer noises") freezes, at least I've been waiting for minutes now for it to end. Repeating the search in a subset of that ZK with just a few hundred notes, it ends after some seconds, but it's still borderline usable.
  
So I guess the answer is a sound NO, org-ql can't be reasonably used in a setup like this one. u/github-alphapapa do you have any objection to my methodology here? Thanks!
 EDIT: deft has also been terribly sluggish with this same ZK, both in generating the deft buffer and in searching through it, so the best option seems to be something like consult-ripgrep.

 What is the proper procedure to install themes? A post on stackoverflow mentions the need to disable themes before applying a new theme. Trying this sometimes works and sometimes does not. It does change the mixing but there is still mixing

This is something to celebrate, but also an occasion to look back and see what this addition means, implementation wise.
This new feature required indeed some deep changes both in the high-level algorithm describing the build loop (and also as a consequence in its low-level details) as well as in the “plumbing” code around it.
Note: Because it touches the implementation, this post will be more technical than the others, and will also assume that you’re somewhat familiar with what content-addressed derivations means, and how it works.

 tldr:

 The stated purpose of Avy, jumping to things, makes it sound like a (contextually) faster Isearch. But jumping is only one of many possibilities. Avy's "Act" part (“dispatch list”, a collection of actions you can perform on a candidate) is where it truly shines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curious about people's use of Org agenda. I initially was really enamored by the idea of using one system for notes, writing, and task, time, and project management, but found Org-agenda a bit too clunky and requiring too much thinking about how to set it up rather than using it. 
 I'm interested in developing some more Org-centric apps in the future, and was wondering whether a note-focused Org app would be used at all if people heavily relied on TODOs and such sprinkled within their notes. Personally I think a separate application (possibly also utilizing Org-mode) for such things would be better, but that's just me!
 Let me know your workflows!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just randomly did "M-x notes" and the auto completes showed something called org-add-notes! I thought this is something similar to remember-notes, and immediately decided to write a note using this. I did that a few more times and stored them with C-c C-c.
 Now the problem is I don't know where to get them! Where are they stored? I have not set this up in any way in my init.el. I didn't even know about the existence of this command a few minutes ago.
 The documentation of this command does not give me any hints. Also, directly searching through org-mode info command index does not give anything. I can see the code for this in org.el but I am not a pro in elisp code reading and cannot figure out where exactly my notes are being saved.
 I do have the feeling from the code that this is actually not similar to remember-notes but perhaps has something to do with adding comments/notes to any org file item... but I may have understood wrong.

You can configure the list using the following format:
Full path:Some description:spacemacs-theme

The image above displays text in olivetti-mode, using the great iA Writer Duospace font.
And this is the macro (I bind it to ^⌘J D):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All *** TL:DR my experience*** I have been a part time emacs user for a decade now, with only 2/3 packages + maybe 30 lines of configuration added over the years.
 Lately i have been furstrated my my c++ IDE at work. I tried rtags a few years back but it crashed frequently. When checking the state of things recently I noticed LSP was getting big so I decided to give it a try to switch full time. I installed a few more packages like lsp, helm (love it). I even read the beginner's elisp intro to understand its syntax.
 That's when the rabbit hole started and i read about spacemacs and doom emacs
 *** doom/spacemacs : an overwhelming layer *** I get the reason for those distributions : having a curated set of packages preconfigured to work together + load time optimisations for an out of the box working experience. (+vim like experience for those who like it) 
 My issue was that after installing i did not know where to start. These 100+ packages must be worth learning right ? I expected a kind of interactive walkthrough like emacs's own tutorial but ended up on the web documentation instead, which was also overwhelming.
 I wonder how people who have never used emacs/vim can get started easily on this. Do they use only 1% of the available features ? Is there a master tutorial somewhere that i missed ? 
 And for people who like tinkering/debugging with their config to have exactly what they want, i find it much easier on a minimalistic example than when 100+ plugins are involved.
 ** who are those distributions for ? *** I have the feeling that beginners would be better off with a simple config with discoverability improvements like which-key/helm
 And for seasoned user who like tinkering with the defaults, i find that building your config helps you understand how to use the plugin you're using
 So fellow doom/space users, what made you jump on that train ? How did you get to "master" this complex environment ? 
 Cheers

 I recently discovered power of literate devops concept and for many cases it works great but I have problem with completion if I am connected to remote server over SSH (but not TRAMP but in Org babel session).
 E.g.:
 #+begin_src sh :session server ssh server1 #+end_src 
 C-c C-c to evaluate code block to establish SSH connection with server1 creates a shell buffer with the same name. Now C-x b, switch to that buffer in shell major mode and bash completion doesn't work properly. It means if I want to cd /etc/ and the press TAB twice it doesn't prompts content of /etc directory of my remote machine but my local. If I want correct completion of remote shell I have to use TRAMP session. Does anyone fix that problem and found workaround? Babel shell sessions are more comfortable for me.

 When I invoke dired, helm wants to know which directory I want. It shows the current directory as a starting point. My question is how to edit this input. C-a takes me to the beginning of the line. C-S backspace clears the line, but how would I delete a word at a time? I'm currently backspacing a character at a time and that's just annoying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I followed the discussion in a recent thread about people handling effects in Haskell. Many people seem to rely on a combination of some environment and IO, in one way or another (RIO, ReaderT env IO, IO + explicitly passing some environment, Handle Pattern, record-of-functions in the environment, ...).
 I am currently experimenting with a slightly different approach and I am quite happy with the results so far. More concretely, instead of combining an environment with IO, we can combine it with a continuation-based version of IO (aka ContT/Codensity/Managed) like ...
 newtype Program e a = Program (e -> forall b. (a -> IO b) -> IO b) 
 ... with instances for Applicative, Functor, Monad, MonadIO, etc. One can read the type as "a program running with an environment of type e and producing a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I want to make two customizations to lsp-ui-imenu, when using python + pyright. First, running lsp-ui-imenu returns function names as well as all variables. I want it to return only function name so that I can jump to the top easily when using consult-imenu. I have looked into filtering this list in the source code but haven't found how to do it. Second, is there a way for lsp-ui-imenu to show entries from the entire git-repo? It would be amazing if I could use this to jump between files, rather than having to first open the correct file then searching for the function name.
 Any help or pointers appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I've posted this on r/functionalprogramming. In short: I'm not smart enough for Haskell, so I'm looking for other alternatives where immutability and pure functions are, if not mandatory, at least encouraged.
 In just a few days I hopped to Elm, Ocaml, back to Typescript and, finally, there and back again to Javascript(is programming-language hopping a thing?), after this book got me excited to give it a try. After reaching to chapter 8 with a certain hopelessness regarding (lack of) types, I ended up to this article with quite strong arguments against using JS if you want strong typing and functional proogramming facilities ("Functional programming. Types. JavaScript. Pick two"). The article mentioned PureScript and here I am. From Haskell syntax to strong typing, the language seems to have everything I'm looking for mentioned right at its home page.
 While learning Haskell, I liked pretty much almost everything. I really, really liked its syntax, the ways we can define types and type classes, its simplicity, and I think it was relatively easy to learn that. What got me really overburdened was how to "change states" and IO. From that point of view, is there something along the way that disapoint me?
 EDIT: this is being helpful: https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Differences-from-Haskell.md

 I use ivy-switch-buffer bound to C-x b to switch to another buffer. Is it possible to assign numbers to the buffers so that pressing a number from the buffer list will automatically switch to that buffer? This will save a few keystrokes compared to moving up and down / fuzzy search for the buffer name and then press Enter.

 It seems that if I type out the abbrev really quickly and press M-', then it works, but inserts a dash after the needed expansion. If I type it out slowly, and then press M-', it just places the dash after the thing that I need to expand. Then, if I quickly typed the thing and expanded it with M-', I can expand it second time if I type it out and press C-x '. If I JUST type it out and press C-x ', nothing happens. I also tried doing it using hippie-expand, and it works, on the second time, printing "Using try-expand-all-abbrevs" in the echo area.
 I tried doing the same thing with completely clean emacs config (emacs -Q), and the results are the same. My version of emacs is 28.0.50. What am I doing wrong?

 I wanted to disable the hideous wall of text next to the code that was showing actions and diagnostics, and simply use lsp-ui-sideline-apply-code-actions to see them in the minibuffer or a side display buffer/window. I was able to hide the text but not able to make list of available actions for a symbol show, with the config below, lsp-ui-sideline-apply-code-actions says - No code actions on the current line. While using lsp-execute-code-action shows the list of all actions not just the ones available for the symbol (in the context of the current symbol, while it works fine when lsp-ui-sideline-show-code-actions t) which is quite bad. I just can't understand why there is no way to hide just the actions as text in the work buffer while retaining the ability to fetch the relevant actions on demand only.

Zettel Crafting Checklist v.3
If surgeons and airline pilots can benefit from checklists, they probably will help me. 1
It is essential to keep any formal checklist flexible and straightforward. 
There is a difference between the structure of a zettel and its content. A checklist supports the completion of the physical form of the zettel. A checklist can only provide prompts to complete the knowledge assimilation. This knowledge assimilation comes from contextual deep thinking that focuses on the second-order meanings exposed by the idea in the zettel.
My idea of a zettel-making-checklist is that it focuses on the structure, thereby freeing up cognitive cycles so I can focus on the zettel content. And heaven knows I need all the cognitive cycles I can muster.
New Note Checklist
YAML Frontmatter [[202003231450]]
Body
Actual zettel (may include one or more of the following)
Argument
Counterarguments
Factual claim
Reference (to other text)
Quotation (only the pithiest)
Metaphor (a figurative comparison)
Summary of idea
Definition
Question posed by the author
Questioning the author
An idea #2do
Mentally elaborate on the concept. Elaborate on both the text you are reading and on your understanding. Use these elaborations as the search query for exploring the zettelkasten and not just the keywords and phrases in the body of the text. You'll be rewarded with connections that sparkle, these connections are the macronutrients of knowledge.
[ ] Connect to an existing structure note or make this the first zettel connection in a new structure note?
Footer/References/Citations/NOtes
This is only a draft. Refactor, Refactor, Refactor!
@Nick stimulated a bunch of ideas/elaborations for the contextual deep thinking section with this comment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to everyone. I have a little problem, I have used Neovim Coc while learning Javascript and I want to know is if there is a way for lsp-mode to behave like Coc. For example, when typing the next in Neovim:
 button.addEventListener("click", (e) => { alert("THIS IS A BUTTON!!!!"); e.target.style.background = "blue"; }); 
 If I ask for completion for e.target.... in Coc, I get style option and background, etc. When I want to do this in lsp-mode in Emacs, I don't get any candidate.
 Another example is if I select an HTML element by putting their class or id:
 let test = document.querySelector(".this-is-a-class");
 let test2 = document.querySelector("#this-is-an-id");
 when I ask for property completion in Coc for test and test2, I get candidates corresponding to the HTML element. In lsp-mode I don't get any of these.
 I don't know if Coc works like this or if lsp-mode doesn't have this feature. Sorry but English is not my first language.

I'd like to be able to add a couple of todos to my todo file and immediately have them version controlled.

My approach is to initialize the file with #+OPTIONS: toc:nil... (among other settings) and then later define #+TOC: headlines 2 where I want the table of contents to appear.
 My problem is that with the above approach, I get two tables of contents - one at the beginning of the file and another where I declared the #+TOC:... Is there something else in org-mode with precedence over the #+OPTIONS: statement? Is there a way to "force" the suppression of the top-of-file toc?

Don't get me started on all of the things I hate about this..BUT, one of the things I am disliking intensely the most is that I can no longer just type "emacs filename" at the command line, and invoke plain old non-GUI emacs. I've installed the GUI emacs from emacsformacsosx, and I have an alias so I can invoke it by typing "emacs filename", but of course it still invokes the efmo GUI version. I'm competent enough to sudo and follow clear step-by-step instructions (yeah, I'm one of those users that every sysadmin dreads..I know *just* enough to f everything up), but everything I've found assumes that you already have 'brew' or some other one (I forget the name)...and that's where I'm stymied. Does anybody have pointers to step-by-step directions for getting regular emacs back on my computer? (There are a lot of sites that say "emacs comes already installed but it's not the best version" but if that is true for Big Sur out of the box, for the life of me I can't find it (lots of files with emacs in the name do turn up when I do a 'locate' but none that seem to be actually executable).
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 First post here, long time emacs user, I hope I understood the rules correctly.
 I'm trying to use pkcs11 client authentication from within emacs (the new way if possible, i.e. without disabling the internal gnutls support).
 On the command line it's possible to use client certificates from a hardware token via e.g --provider /usr/lib64/libeTPkcs11.so and by passing the appropriate strings for --x509certfile= and --x509keyfile (obtained via p11tool).
 From https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html#Help-for-users I gather that it should be possible to set those strings in ~/.authinfo.gpg but I guess the only thing that's missing would be the --provider switch. Any idea how to add that one?
 Thanks in advance for any kind of suggestion!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! So I've been interested in Haskell for quite a while now: I know how to use monads, transformers, some type level programming too... However I have no idea when to use these. For example, I once wrote a twitch chat bot in Haskell. How do I decide whether to do sendMsg :: TwitchBot -> Text -> IO () Or sendMsg :: Text -> TwitchBotM () ? The latter seemed tempting, but in practice I rarely chained anything, and I mostly worked in MonadIO, so it just bloated the code as I had to do runTwitchBotM twitchBot (...) everywhere.
 How can I learn to make these kinds of decisions beforehand?
 Thanks :)

 Now, for rust, there is cargo-aoc which minimizes friction to a great extend.
 Is there something similar for Haskell available, too? Or at least a decent project template where I can focus on solving the tasks without fighting the tooling?
 EDIT: Searching for one brought up this thread, but one of them is down and I can't judge the quality of the other one in there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using vterm a lot, and really like entering vterm-copy-mode. However, sometimes (I haven't figured out under what circumstances) the following sequence of commands leads to weird behavior:
  
I enter copy mode
 
select a word in the middle of a line using the normal emacs commands
 
yank that word
 
exit copy mode
 
paste that word
 
 For instance, I use ps to enumerate processes, select a process ID using copy mode, then try to kill $my-selected-id.
 What happens is the whole line is pasted instead of the single word.
 Anyone experienced this and has a way to fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I felt like telling my experiences of using org-mode for school as a new emacs user.
 So to begin, I am a long-time vim user, but not a power user. I used vim to edit smaller files (like config files, etc.). I primarily used a graphical IDE for my "real" work (JetBrains tools specifically). After watching some videos on emacs (shout-out DistroTube), I decided to give emacs a try. I went for doom emacs since it seemed to be the most popular, and it had vim-like keybindings (evil mode). Once I learned the basics of org-mode, I decided that this would be amazing for taking notes in class. 
 After a few weeks of taking notes in class, I am very happy with org-mode for taking notes. I really like the customizability of emacs (not org-mode specifically). 
 Some of the features I use the most are:
  
Inserting LaTeX snippets for complex math/comp. sci notes.
 Folding headers to keep my notes clean
 Adding TODO tags (with org agenda) to log assignments/exams
 Exporting org files to other formats (especially HTML) to share with classmates
  
What other features do you guys like to use for this purpose? And is there any feedback you can give me to make my experience even better?

 I did not really find was I was looking for so I did this while watching the conference this weekend ;)
 Maybe this is useful for someone else too, plus I'd appreciate comments. I'm still figuring out how I really want it to be like and to use it, but it should be ready to go for most purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to post this as a comment but it wouldn't let me post screenshots.
 The local Scala 3.0 REPL does have a command line option for no colors. It only applies for the ensuing session.
 In a few cases, the colors do really help things pop, like for example, error messages:
 More \"arrows\" make it easier to spot the mistake.
 It also does make tab completion a little more obvious:

 Still, it's good to know I can turn the colors off if I think they'll be too distracting for a particular session.
 As for the thing with val and var, it seems to depend only on how you declared that particular item, without regard for whether the class itself is mutable or immutable.

 ​
 Both quick fixes thanks to u/pepeiborra

 Also it fixes some long standing bugs in the hlint plugin due to comments being ignored (see [#2366](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2366))

I have almost everything setup, with lsp. Evil is giving me slight problems. My problem is that for certain minor modes like view-mode, I can't use my space bar as the leader key anymore, since it is remapped by view-mode to scroll. I also can't use my space bar in dired. The major info mode also doesn't integrate very well with evil. If someone could tell me a solution or share their configs, that would be great ! :)

 Often i see navigation pattern similar to following:
  
- Word/Line movement (backward-word, forward-word, move-beginning-of-line, move-end-of-line) 
 - Bigger Jumps (isearch-forward, isearch-backward, ace-jump-mode, avy-goto-char-timer) 
 - Fine-tuning (previous-line, next-line, left-char, right-char)
  
Does this also apply for org-mode or are you using more org orientated commands like org-shifttab (S-TAB), org-next-visible-heading (C-c C-n), etc to move around?

 Hi, I've recently been red pilled into Linux and currently am running Fedora.
 I find navigating my computer via a 'Terminal' (if that's the correct terminology) to be the ultimate way to use a computer for my use case of simplicity and productivity.
 Being new to Linux, how would I go about having a similar 'setup' as shown in this video, being able to navigate my computer via this 'terminal' with a file directory and have multiple windows etc?
 (I've found I'll like to settle on using emacs if that helps/is relevant)
 Thank-you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example, suppose we had a relation on records where A ≤ B exactly when B has all the fields that A has and possibly some extra fields. That is to say, let the relation on records be induced by the subset relation on the sets of field labels.
 Example:
 data A = A {x, y: Int} data B = B {x, y, z: Int} 
 Here, B has an extra field z, so we are justified in saying that A ≤ B.
 Now:
  
A function that takes A can also take B (and ignore all the extra fields).
 In other words, if f ∷ A → Y and b ∷ B, then f b ∷ Y is well-typed.
 
A function that gives B can also give A (and forget all the extra fields).
 In other words, if f ∷ X → B and x ∷ X, then f x ∷ B is well-typed.
 
 This can currently be done by writing boring code, so having it as a feature would reduce the amount of boring code, which is good. In real life, records tend to be big, so the reduction is substantial.
 A dual construction can be offered for sum types: for example, a function that can take A + B can handle an A or a B as well.
 Is this less than ideal? What are the problems? In a dream world of infinite possibilities, where you can add subtyping to Haskell, how would you go about it?
  
I imagine there are some people here that know everything there is to know about type systems, some people that have no idea of what a type system with subtyping looks like (me — I only know C and Haskell), and many people somewhere in between. So hopefully this conversation can be a common ground. I realize that the presentation above is already too technical for some and unbearably naïve to others. Please ask questions, and please correct my errors, thank you!

 I want setup emacs to do the same thing my vim does or close:
  
Have typescript/javascript support
 Have HTML, CSS, SCSS etc support - I think this is webmode?
 Fuzzy finder
 Indent guides
 Sexy colorschemes :) (non-negotiable lol)
 I prefer to work in the terminal so if I can get icon support in terminal that would amazing. I know this is possible... if vim can do it then emacs can.
 Vim keybinds.. again, non-negotiable.
  
I feel like this might be a bit too much lol.. but primarily would like to have really solid support for web development.

 Jet is a structural editor for JSON.
 That is, it's an editor which is aware of the structure of JSON and allows you to manipulate it directly. As a result, the document is always in a valid state. 
 $ cabal update && cabal install jet $ jet my.json 
 Hit '?' for the key bindings. Maybe back up any important files first. 
 Give it a go and let me know what you think https://github.com/ChrisPenner/jet
 ​
 The implementation uses a zipper over a Cofree tree, which should be pretty adaptable to most recursive structures (e.g. ASTs). You can find the Cofree Zipper here: https://github.com/ChrisPenner/recursive-zipper#readme
 ​
 To head off the "just use a text-editor" comments; yes, you should probably just use a text editor. This was mainly written as a research exercise for more complex structural editors, and also because I couldn't find many good resources on writing structural editors and wanted to see what the abstractions might look like. Hopefully you enjoy the experiment as much as I enjoyed writing it 😄

 Cheers!

 I'm getting the annoying org-mode migration notice, and 5 second delay that other people are experiencing. 
 All the solutions in that thread appear to boil down to: delete org from .emacs.d/elpa, and install it from elpa next time.
 But I don't have a "org", or a "org-contrib". I have "org-plus-contrib", but that seems to only be available from Org's ELPA?
 Here's my init.el (yes, it's awful and brittle), I don't know what would be the pain point. To aid, here's a tree of the directory.

        <updated>2021-11-28T18:39:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many have suggested adding a lambda reader construct to Emacs Lisp: something like #(princ $1), which would be translated to (lambda (x) (princ x)).
 Well, it turns out that you can (ab)use the existing reader constructs for this purpose. Specifically, ,x and ,@x are translated to (\, x) and (\,@ x), which are without meaning outside of a backquoted list.
 That means that it is legal to define and use \, as a function or macro:
 (defmacro \, (body) "Return an anonymous function. In BODY, symbols of the type $N, where N is a non-zero, positive number, represent positional arguments. $* represents a list of optional remaining arguments. ,(+ $1 $2) expands to (lambda ($1 $2) (+ $1 $2)). See `lambda'." (let ((total 0) rest) (cl-labels ((search (form) (if (consp form) (progn (search (car form)) (search (cdr form))) (if (eq form '$*) (setq rest t) (let ((s (prin1-to-string form))) (if (string-match "^\\$\\([1-9][0-9]*\\)$" s) (let ((n (string-to-number (match-string 1 s)))) (setq total (max total n))))))))) (search body)) `(lambda ,(append (cl-loop for n from 1 upto total collect (intern (format "$%d" n))) (and rest '(&rest $*))) ,body))) 
 With this macro, you can replace
 (mapcar (lambda (x) (with-output-to-string (princ x))) objects) 
 with
 (mapcar ,(with-output-to-string (princ $1)) objects) 
 If you want your lambda to accept an unlimited number of arguments, use `$*':
 (advice-add 'some-function :before ,(dolist (x $*) (message "%s" x))) 
 What are the downsides? Strictly, there is only one. The docstring for the macro above will not be displayed in Emacs' help system, which will always display the built-in information about ,.

 I just discovered this sub, and have no Emacs experience. I hope my question makes sense. 
 I regularly use remote Debian machines at work, interacting exclusively via SSH sessions. I was curious about using Emacspeak on them, as I’m visually impaired. Everything I’m reading is about setting up Emacspeak locally, though. I’ve found mention of a remote speech server, but haven’t found any guides on exactly how to get it to work. I use Windows as my primary OS at work. 
 In summary, my usual workflow is: on Windows, SSH into Debian, and use a Windows screen reader to interact with the remote machine that way. If I can, I’d like to have Emacspeak running on the remote machine, with speech and sound output coming from my local Windows computer. The lag may make this unusable, I don’t know. I’d at least like to give it a shot, just to see what happens. Again, I’ve also never used Emacs in any way. I’m comfortable in Bash, though. Thanks for any suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like programing in scala and I am the guy who wants to become an expert in scala even if I am not this moment. Since my job has been related to data I have started getting a focus to machine learning. Of course I know python is epic but I also know scala can do this like python. I found out spark and smile are good libraries for big data and machine learning, but I couldn't find proper libraries for data visualization. Yeap. smile has good visualization libraries based on swing and vega lite. At this moment I wonder other scala programmers how to work and which library you like. Is it impossible for scala to overcome python in this fields?

 So am I right? We have to disavow C-x for cut and C-c for paste? - My daughter says it won't take too long to relearn. Is she right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In every other text editor I've used, I've never had to think about indents. In emacs, on the other hand, it is a constant battle. For example, right now i'm editing a solidity file with a two space indent, emacs of course tries to ident to four spaces, and i have no idea how to change this. This is always made even worse by electric ident mode's insane "reindent the current line when you press enter" behavior - I literally cannot imagine thinking that was a good idea.

 Why is emacs so shitty?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to set up pylsp and have a key shortcut to create dedicated shells in python. The code for the dedicated shell looks like this:
 (defun my-python-start-or-switch-repl (&optional msg) "Start and/or switch to the REPL." (interactive "p") (if (python-shell-get-process) (python-shell-switch-to-shell) (progn (run-python (python-shell-calculate-command) t t) (python-shell-switch-to-shell) ) ) ) 
 The code that binds the key to that is
 (add-hook 'python-mode-hook (lambda () (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c !") 'my-python-start-or-switch-repl)) ) 
 which I got all from here 
 The code to setup pylsp I got it from this video (29:51) and he also shares his github page and it looks like this (1):
 (use-package python-mode :ensure t :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred) :custom (python-shell-interpreter "python")) 
 It all works nicely: I get autocomplete and the other features and can run C-c ! to have dedicated shells. However, once I close emacs with M-x kill-emacs and open it again, and then I run C-c ! to have the dedicated shell I get the error: Symbol's function definition is void: python-shell-get-process 
 I tested not defining (1) and just the code that gives the dedicated shells and it does not have that behavior, namely, I can close emacs, open it again and the dedicated shells can still be launched with C-c ! . That tells me, the problem is generated when I introduce (1), but I am not sure why and more importantly how to fix it. I'd appreciate any help.

 fingerprint.c:66:3: fatal error: opening dependency file deps/fingerprint.d: No such file or directory }; ^ 
 I checked this file inside and I found something annoying
 volatile unsigned char fingerprint[] = { 0xDE, 0x86, 0xBB, 0x99, 0xFF, 0xF5, 0x46, 0x9A, 0x9E, 0x3F, 0x9F, 0x5D, 0x9A, 0xDF, 0xF0, 0x91, 0xBD, 0xCD, 0xC1, 0xE8, 0x0C, 0x16, 0x1E, 0xAF, 0xB8, 0x6C, 0xE2, 0x2B, 0xB1, 0x24, 0xCE, 0xB0, }; 
 As you can see this array has a trailing comma. This array comes from 
 shuf -i 0-255 -n 32 -r | awk '{printf " 0x%.02X,\n", $0}' 
 and output has a trailing comma too
  0x8B, 0x74, 0x47, 0x92, 0x34, 0x61, 0xFE, 0x6B, 0x27, 0xDB, 0x4E, 0x78, 0x6F, 0xD6, 0x37, 0x2D, 0x60, 0xF1, 0x0B, 0x79, 0xD7, 0xBC, 0xC3, 0x21, 0x9E, 0x4E, 0x63, 0x05, 0x1D, 0xB5, 0x63, 0x93, 
 Is this correct? is this trailing comma normal, or something in my OS is misconfigured.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I come here to ask for help after about 8 frustrating hours trying to solve this exercise, so please help me figure this out.
 I am trying to recursively look in a list of pairs where one element of the pair is a product and the second element is 2 numbers representing its position on the shelves [ (meat,(4,5)) , (soap,(6,7)) , (wine,(4.3)) ] and verify if in any situation I end up with 2 products on the same spot on the shelf.
 ​
 Basically I dont care what the product is, my only concern is that 2 things dont end up trying to be restocked on the same position on the shelves.
 ​
 I have the shelves and the products set has data types so for example I know that Products can only be Milk, Wine, Soap, Eggs, Butter....like 10 more, and That ShelfPos is (Int,Int).
 ​
 What I have been trying to do is has requested on the exercise.
 ​
 positionIsFree :: [(Products, ShelfPos)] -> Bool
 ​
 positionIsFree [ ] = True
 positionIsFree (( products, shelfpos) : [ ] ) = True
 positionIsFree (( p, (x,y)) : ( p2, (x2,y2)) : t) | x == x2 && y == y2 = False
 --------(reddit formating is hard)---------------| otherwise = positionIsFree ((p, (x,y)) : t )
 ​
 This works for the first pair, it runs the list and sees if it causes any conflict. If it doesnt Id like to restart the process with the second pair. The problem I am runing in is whenever I finish doing this I cant restart again since I trew away all my list on the otherwise step.
 I tried to do this backwards, like always comparing the last element, but I end up runing into a types problem where it says it expects a Bool and is getting a list.
 ​
 Thank you for your time reading this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve tried looking into this question, and so far I understand that using overloaded strings and strictness are good ways to improve performance. However, I don’t understand how fast Haskell is relative to other languages. Some claim that it is slower than Python; others claim that it can be as fast as or faster than C. The programming language benchmark game suggests that Haskell is roughly as fast as Java and C#, but this is complicated by the extensive use of foreign libraries in those languages.

 This way has some limitations, like it allows the symbols are one-character. For some key words like BEGIN_SRC and END_SRC, I want a line so that the SRC block is singled out. 
 The package https://github.com/rougier/svg-lib can generate good svg icons. Is there a way to use those svg icons to replace the key words? Or there is some performance issue and it is not recommended?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I've been using ncmpcpp and mpd for a while now after I figured out how to configure them (i even wrote a blogpost about it), but since I am always in emacs I find inconvenient to have to always quit emacs to control my music. so I am looking for an mpd client on emacs.
 now there are a few solutions that come to mind:
  
use vterm and open ncmpcpp from that: too much work + vterm is slower than a regular terminal
 use the mpc client that comes with emacs : the mpc client is sooo bad there doesnt seem to be a way to even stop the music (I am talking about the mpc gui inside of emacs, not the seperate commands like mpc-stop, mpc-pause etc..)
 use something else entriely like emms: emms is too slow and I generally want to stay within mpd 
  
so what I want is, an mpd client that has a usubl interface and that is made specifically for emacs (i.e not running from vterm or something else) and just to clarify I don't want a 1 to 1 clone, I just want something that works.
 thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,I have been using Emacs on Windows for a while, and I really liked the audible bell effect (when you press C-g, or when you press undefined keys / unknown commands).Recently, I switched to GNU/Linux (Debian 11 to be exact) and installed Emacs there (I have not included my customization yet, it is a fresh install), but there was no sound at all, even though the system has no problems playing sounds in other applications.
 visible-bell is nil, beep does not produce sound, play-sound does not work.
 I also tested Emacs on Ubuntu 20.04, NixOS 21.05 and Debian 11 in a VM. The Emacs on the Ubuntu machine worked perfectly, but Emacs on the NixOS and Debian 11 machines did not have sound.
 On all 3 machines, lspci | grep -i audio gives the same output:
 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03) 
 Also, aplay -l gives the same output:
 **** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices **** card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: Generic Analog [Generic Analog] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 
 Just like the host machine, other applications' sound works fine on all 3 VMs, it is just Emacs without sound, so I don't really think it is a driver issue that only Ubuntu solved (but this is just my guess, I could be wrong). 
 I did not find this issue online, have you encountered this problem before? The closest thing I found was this post but I don't think it is applicable to my case.
 What can I do? Thanks for any info you can provide!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to use ffap (to open files/dirs) in windows I select with ace-window (https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window). Similar to what aw-switch-buffer-in-window and aw-switch-buffer-other-window do, but with find-file-at-point instead of buffer selection. Crucially, point means point when the function is called.
 I made a minor modification to ffap-other-window and it works:
  (defun my-ffap-ace-window (filename) "Like `ffap-other-window', window selected via ace window." (interactive (list (ffap-prompter nil " other window"))) (pcase (save-window-excursion (find-file-at-point filename)) ((or (and (pred bufferp) b) `(,(and (pred bufferp) b) . ,_)) (ace-select-window) (switch-to-buffer b) ))) 
 However, this function first does the ffap selection and then asks for the window. For consistency with the other ace- and aw- functions I'd like it to first select the window and then do the ffap thing.
 I've tried hacking this with several approaches (saving excursion first, then selecting the window with aw-select and then finding the file; trying to modify this find-file-ace-window, https://stackoverflow.com/a/47624310 , which makes dired's open in other window use ace-window; modifying aw-switch-buffer-other-window) but my elisp ignorance is getting me nowhere.
 Is this easily doable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am new to Emacs and I am running it on macOS. I use the GUI app, but I frequently want to launch it from the command line. With VS Code, if I ran code {filename} it would launch VS Code (or use the existing copy running) and open the file I want to edit. It would then exit the code command so I could continue to use the terminal.
 If I run emacs {filename}, a new instance of the Emacs GUI is launched (even if there is an existing instance) and the command does not exit until I quit the GUI instance that is spawned. That isn't the largest problem - I can always open a new tab, but I would prefer it to not do so. I would also like it if the file I opened was added as a buffer to the existing instance of the GUI if one is already open.
 Is this possible to do? I tried to do some searching on my own first, but I'm not even sure what terms to use for the searches and I (obviously) not been successful so far.
 Thanks for any help :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to set up pyright with pyvenv. This is what I am doing:
 I am running on fedora 35 with python 3.10 and emacs 27.2.
 I install emacs with sudo dnf install emacs. Then I paste this into the .emacs file:
 (require 'package)(add-to-list 'package-archives'("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))
 Then I install elpy and pyvenv (I don't think elpy is necessary) with M-x package-install RET elpy RET ,then I create a virtual environment with M-x pyvenv-create that I activate and work on, which is literally M-x pyvenv-activate and M-x pyvenv-workon I also install use-package with M-x package-install RET use-package RET . Finally I install lsp-mode using: M-x package install RET lsp-mode RET Then I include this to the .emacs file:
 (use-package lsp-pyright:ensure t:hook (python-mode . (lambda()(require 'lsp-pyright)(lsp))))
 But when I eval the buffer, I get the error:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install lsp-pyright: Package 'lsp-pyright' is unavailable
 Error (use-package): Cannot load lsp-pyright
 I am not sure why I get that error or what I am doing wrong. Could it be because I am using python 3.10? I had some issues with elpy because I was using python 3.10. And more importantly, how to resolve that? I'd appreciate if anyone has a tutorial on this.
 ​
 Edit: The code formatting looks awful. Sorry about that. In the .emacs file that formatting (indexing) is fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m preparing for this year’s Advent of Code by working on last year’s problems. I am very new to Cabal, having learnt it this week, and am practising problem solving and project organisation on day 4’s problem. You’ll find my Cabal project for day 4 here.
 Here’s the issue. I discovered that HLS no longer flags erroneous code in VS Code. However, it still gives me suggestions on what to do.
 In my Main.hs there is a deliberately-incorrect function called test. I used it to see what was going on with HLS.
 test :: Int -> Int test x = show x 
 In my Cabal project, HLS only suggested that I refactor the definition using eta reduction. It did not say anything about a mismatched return type. When I created a random Haskell file outside Cabal, HLS worked as expected and showed me both messages.
 Here are further details in case they are useful:
  
macOS 12.0.1 Monterey
 VS Code 1.62 (with Haskell extension 1.7.1)
 GHC 8.10.7 (installed using ghcup)
 Cabal 3.6.2.0 (installed using ghcup)
 HLS 1.5.0 (installed using ghcup)
  
How might I resolve this?

 Not pretty, but clear enough. Now here's a similar session in the local Scala 3 REPL (I have Scala 3 on a different Windows computer)

 I should have taken the screenshot to include the definition of f().
 Prior to my most recent eye exam, I had quite a bit of trouble reading unstaged changes in Git. This reminds me of that. But I'm not getting new glasses again so soon.
 That thing with the val or the var that might be an improvement. I'll have to remember to play around with import java.awt._ or something like that in my next Scala 3 REPL session.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Occasionally, when I call org-capture, the template selection screen will be launched but then fail to respond to any further keypresses until I C-g, locking up Emacs (and making my desktop fans spin up!) in the meantime. This seems to happen randomly, and doesn't correlate with any changes in my init.el, so I'm at a loss for how to diagnose it. I've profiled org-capture with edebug after this behavior started, but I haven't been able to get it to hang while stepping through it yet - I'm not sure whether that's due to the fact I'm walking through it instead of using bytecode (although I've rebuilt everything recently so I know it's not stale) or just because I haven't gotten lucky enough to provoke the weird behavior.
 Any tips for how to profile what's causing a command to hang?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am about to do a research project, which I want to do about Purely Functional Scala or very related topics. But I am a bit lost on keywords or ideas that are interesting. The only thing I have done in this field is read the "Functional Programming in Scala" (red book) as part of my "Advanced Programming" course in my graduate degree. 
 So I am just interested in any project ideas or theories you guys have heard about as inspiration for my topic?
 The research project could be described as:
 "The research project is an ordinary 7.5 ECTS project intended to bridge the gap between your specialization and your graduate thesis. You use it to make sure you have done the legwork necessary to get a running start on your thesis. The Research Project very often takes the form of narrowly focused literature study or a prototype implementation or use of particular software tools." 
 Requirements for the research project:
  
It must use tools, languages, techniques, and theories that you find interesting. 
 It must advance “what we know” in some way, although not necessarily by much. 
 It must be a topic within Computer Science or applications of Computer Science. 
  
Some topics I heard about as inspiration
  
Analyse cats, cats-effect or cats-parse - explain their design 
 Parser combinators
 Getting familiar with "programs as values" and comparing the way of writing programs in that style with Futures or even just plain Scala. 
  
But I am looking for other topics too as an inspiration. Any help will be much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of migrating back to emacs (for org-mode, especially org-roam) from vim land and want to recreate my workflow. I have a work-issued MacBook that's performance is less than optimal, especially for docker stuff. To remedy that, I have a beefy VM on my personal workstation that I ssh into then do all my work in nvim with tmux and it all works quite nicely.
 I'm trying to recreate that workflow with the Emacs GUI. I've found a few blog posts that talk about SSH forwarding the emacs server socket allowing you to open remote files in your GUI using TRAMP mode. This is not really what I want since I want pretty much all compute, (running makes tasks, using the lang server, etc) to be on my workstation VM and just have a window into it via the emacs GUI on my Mac.
 What I'm looking at doing now is running an emacs server in TCP mode on my VM, then connecting to that on my mac. What I've read so far is that it wasn't made for what I want, just because Windows doesn't support Unix sockets, and there are massive security concerns, which is not a concern for me since my VM is only accessible through a VPN.
 I guess my questions boil down to:
  
Is anyone using emacs server TCP mode to work on a remote machine with good or bad experience?
 Is there a better way to do what I want?
 Am I being a moron trying to use the GUI and should just use emacs in terminal mode like I was with nvim?
  
Thanks for any info you can provide!

As part of my preparation for doing Advent of Code this Christmas, I've decided that I want to approach it more as a project than as a pile of disconnected one-off solutions. In this vein, I am curious as to what the current best practices are around Haskell software packages. Is it stack? Is it nix? Is it ... something else?
 I'll be working on macOS, and I've been writing software a long time, but I consistently bounce off of Haskell and I'd love to be more conversant in it, as there is a lot about Haskell that I really enjoy.
 Anyway, TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I was working in an org file with tables that needed to reference tables from different files. According to the org manual, you can do this with remote(<id>, <range>). This is problematic for a couple of reasons. First, it is very fragile. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Maybe I was doing something wrong with the IDs, but it was very unstable for me. Second, it means that, if you sync your org files in multiple machines, you'll also have to sync the id. Finally, and this is the big one, accoring to the org manual, you assing an ID to a heading and the remote call will look for the first table under that heading. But what if you need the second table?
 Instead of fighting with the IDs problem, I decided to do some elisp magic to see if I could grab a table range from a remote table with file path and #:name. To my surpirse, it was very easy to do. All you need is this function somewhere in your init file:
 (defun j/remote-table-range (path name range) (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect path) (org-table-get-remote-range name range))) 
 Then, you have to add the #:name tag to the remote table:
 ;; Contents of ~/table-test/remote.org #+name: remote-t1 | C1 | C2 | | 1 | 2 | 
 Then, from another table, you can call it like this:
 ;; Contents of ~/table-test/main.org | C1 | C2 | | | | #+tblfm: @1$1='(j/remote-table-range "./remote.org" "remote-t1" (string ?@ ?1 ?$ ?1)) 
 The path can be absolute or relative, and you can reference any table in that file using the name argument. The wierd string call is explained here.
 And that's it. IMO, while it makes for longer formulas, it is way more convenient than the current remote function with IDs and have less limitations. 
 I was amazed with how little code was needed for this. Man, do I love emacs...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a fairly new Haskeller (~1 year) and I've been getting into graphical programming with Haskell using various C bindings like X11, GTK, and OpenGL/GLFW. And while the bindings seem the be very mature and capable, they tend to have me writing in an imperative way (a lot of do blocks for callbacks and such), probably a reality of being bound to imperative languages.
 This got me wondering if it's possible to do graphical programming in Haskell sans any bindings at all. If so are there any projects that attempt to do this? The closest thing I've found so far is GPipe, which promises an alternative to the imperative style of OpenGL, but seems to be built on the OpenGL bindings itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there. I am a new Emacs user, trying it after using Vim for a year or so.I'd say it's ambitious, but I've started from scratch. I didn't want to go with Spacemacs or Doom Emacs. 
 Configuring init.el file got me thinking - What are all those functions? I know that ELisp is a dialect of a programming language called LISP, but knowing many languages ELisp seems so strange. It's absolutely peculiar. 
 You all know that Python has been considered a "pseudo code" language in which you almost tell in human English what do you want to achieve.I actually believe that ELisp falls under that description much better. 
 I don't understand what all those functions are doing below the surface. It seems to me that if I'd want to make a AI Chess game by my own rules, that the only thing I'd need to write in ELisp, would be: 
  
(setq AI-chess-my-own-rules t) 
  
And that would be it.
 Can I see the implementation of each function I have put in my init.el?How does, for example: 
  
(load theme 'doom-gruvbox) 
  
work? 
 Can I see the implementation? Or (scroll-bar-mode -1)? How does that work? Does that tells the X to stop drawing the scroll-bar in Emacs? What is the language that those functions are written in, and where could I see, inside or outside of Emacs, the implementation of it? 
 And how is it possible that I can type a name of any function written in ELisp and it will just work? Aren't there any libraries? How does that work? 
 I believe these are trivial questions for you, but I am really new in this. I fell in love with the Org mode, but Emacs seems so strange. I got used to parenthesis, I get it - That's the syntax. Fine. I don't have a problem with it. But it's absolutely different than any other language I've ever used. 
 Thanks in advance for replies. :)

Can I somehow customize the color of an item - not the keyword, but the rest of the line! - depending on the keyword?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/orgmode
 With Org 9.5, we've got this amazing new citation setup. (See https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-10-31-release.html for a great overview.)
 While my setup previously relied on org-ref for both managing .bib files and fixing LaTeX exporting, I feel like I should upgrade my configuration. I'm thinking of moving away from org-ref because the package always felt a bit too heavy (e.g. relying on helm).
 So I'm looking for inspiration. What do your setups look like? Which packages should I look into?
 Cheers

Announcing autodocodec by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
Autodocodec is short for “Auto-documenting-codec”, or “self(auto)- documenting encoders and decoders”. Writing a Codec from autodocodec lets you encode and decode values, and document the parser all with a single value.

 If you have properly modeled footprints (XY plane of the 3D model on the PCB and origin at the center of the bounding box), then you can easily generate 3D view of the assembly. In this screenshot, you can see the generated model being rendered by view3dscene.
