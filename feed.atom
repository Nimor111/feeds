        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure whether to ask this in the clojure sub-reddit or here so trying here first:
 I use LSP Mode with the clojure lsp server. No problems generally. However, I suddenly have one project that refuses to work with lsp.
 What I've looked at/tried:
  
other projects with similar deps.edn work just fine
 lsp describe session looks identical for the working projects and the one that doesn't 
 nothing looks untoward in the lsp-io-log, though I don't know the protocol well I could be missing something, no errors though
 I've blown away my projectile and lsp caches to start from scratch, same issue
 if I manually add my src dir and restart the lsp workspace lsp starts working (of course only down the src dir)
 clojure -Spath shows "src" as an element in the classpath both before and after I manually add the src path\
 lsp claims to initialize successfully and lsp-describe-sessions shows a visited clj file as a buffer under the root of the project
 after manually adding the src dir and restarting the workspace I wind up with two versions of that project in lsp-describe-sessions: one with "/src" and one without. The visited buffer now exists under the new root but not the original
  
I'd prefer not to spend the day digging into lsp-mode/the lsp server, so if anyone has any insights I'd appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, using doom emacs on a mac, and projectile automatically lists /~ as a project. I'm not sure how this happened, as I don't have a .git directory in home or anything. I wouldn't mind so much, but if I accidentally select that directory as a project emacs hangs so badly that I have to reboot the machine. For some reason I can never find the process ID for emacs for osx to kill -9 it so I have to do a forced reboot with the power button.
 Anyone know a workaround for this? I could just be careful not to select ~ as a project but I'd rather nip this in the bud. It seems that projectile-globally-ignored-directories would ignore ~/code, which isn't great for me, and I'd rather not re-organize my directory structure over this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been going through my init.el config, trying to make sense of some things, and I've noticed the following:
  
Some variables are set using setq (example: (setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed nil)).
 
Some variables are set without using setq (example: (tool-bar-mode -1)).
 
Some variables are set to nil by setting them to nil (see point 1) while some variables are set to nil by setting them to -1 (see point 2).
 
 According to the docs, nil is false, and everything else is true. So my questions are:
  
Why does (tool-bar-mode -1) set the variable to nil?
 
Why are some variables set using setq and some without?
 
What is the difference between (setq some-variable -1), (some-variable -1), (setq some-variable nil), and (some-variable nil)? Are these equivalent? If yes, what would be the best practice?

 I'm happy to announce the new version of dr-cabal — a Haskell dependencies build time profiler!
 This version highlights a few important features:
  
Interactive profiling output
 Computation of a critical path (so you can see non-parallelisable dependencies easier)
 A new refined and simpler CLI interface
  
dr-cabal demo
 The majority of these features were contributed by Andrew Lelechenko (/u/Bodigrim) and honestly I don't know how he finds the time to contribute new awesome features while also doing a tons of work on upgrading the entire ecosystem!
 Anway, I hope you enjoy dr-cabal and you can have more insights into compilation times of your Haskell project dependencies! 🤗

 Recently I was programming in Python and needed to use match/case construction. I found out that Emacs doesn't highlight those words. I thought that they aren't in keywords list and decided to make PR about it onto Emacs git repo. But as it turned out, match/case were already defined as keywords in python.el that was stored in the repo. So I looked at installed on my machine python.el and I saw that it was actually outdated and there were no those words in the list.
 I'm using latest version of Emacs. Could you tell me please, why is that happened and how to fix that properly (i mean, i shouldn't just manually replace my outdated python.el with newer one, should i?)
 Also sorry for possible misspellings 'cause English isn't my native language and sorry for stupid question, I'm newbie :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a recent note that is connected to one of the core problems in the domain of ZK/PKM: How to transfer value creation from one domain (e.g. ones privat ZK) to another (e.g. a blogpost, your daily habits etc.)
This note is focussed on stating the problem.
Feel free to comment, improve on the note -- both on the formalities and the content of the note.
202211150901 Operationalization problem of memory
operationalization #memory
What memory is depends on how you test it. If you understand memory merely as the ability to parrot something that you have stored, memory is something completely different than if you are talking about availability. Do I have a good memory if I can name the back of an index card, but I can't access its contents when I'm supposed to be using it?
Memorization takes into account a small part of this problem: It is a common recommendation that one practice "Active Recall" and not merely repeat the material (e.g., by reading through it several times).
After "Active Recall", the key is to make content available when you actually need it, not just in the test situation. There is a difference between memory and the repertoire at one's disposal.
But it is difficult to operationalize the situation of actual use.
Thesis: You should start with simple memory techniques and then work your way up to more complex ones.

 Recently I started learning Rust and before that I was coding with Python and Nodejs which was absolutely fantastic on emacs. But on Rust I'm having a wierd scrolling lag/delay/stuttering issue even with small files. Everything is working like auto completion, lsp and such but couldn't find why it's lagging on rust files
 here is my config on rust+lsp:
 (after! rustic (setq rustic-lsp-server 'rust-analyzer) ) (after! lsp-mode (setq lsp-enable-symbol-highlighting nil) (setq lsp-diagnostics-provider :none) (lsp-diagnostics--enable) (setq lsp-signature-auto-activate nil) (setq lsp-signature-render-documentation nil) (setq lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable t) (setq lsp-completion-show-detail nil) (setq lsp-log-io nil) (setq lsp-completion-provider :capf) (setq lsp-modeline-diagnostics-scope :file) (setq lsp-enable-file-watchers nil) (setq lsp-idle-delay 0.500) (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1 company-idle-delay 0.5) ) 
 and lsp doctor output:
 Checking for Native JSON support: OK Check emacs supports `read-process-output-max': OK Check `read-process-output-max' default has been changed from 4k: OK Byte compiled against Native JSON (recompile lsp-mode if failing when Native JSON available): OK `gc-cons-threshold' increased?: OK Using `plist' for deserialized objects? (refer to https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/performance/#use-plists-for-deserialization): OPTIONAL Using emacs 28+ with native compilation?: OK

 EDIT: emacs -Q will give you the same result.
 EDIT 2: This does NOT persist in emacs-28.1 tag and master branch. Only persists in emacs-28.2 tag and emacs-28 branch.
 Steps to reproduce
  
Upgrade packages 
 restart-emacs
 M-x toggle-debug-on-error
 M-x toggle-debug-on-quit
 M-x profiler-start
 M-x pyvenv-workon (only if you have it)
 Open a python file in a directory
 Emacs freezes
 Open terminal and run pkill -SIGUSR2 emacs
 you will see stack-trace in emacs, profiler-stop and profiler-report will give you results like below

 I am looking to see if I can replicate VSCode-Vim Easymotion bidirectional word highlighting. I can replicate forward and backward word highlighting for jumps, just not bidirectional.
 For anyone who has hacked together a solution, any suggestions?
 I would like to press space bar and maybe one character and be able to jump to any word shown on the screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 When you send an PGP encrypted mail with Mutt, the Subject line gets protected. Which means that in the headers, the Subject is replaced by "....", and the "real" Subject line is moved to the encrypted part of the email message.
 When receiving a message with a protected header, upon decryption Mutt recognizes the "real" Subject line and shows that in the list of messages.
 Does Gnus support any of thexe options? I have been searching for "protected header" but haven't found anything, but perhaps my search capabilities may not be good enough ...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see many GUI apps implement rounded corners and shadows (usually in electron with CSS).
 Is something like that possible in emacs, for child frames etc? If not, is there a specific limitation that hinders it.
 I know it's something entirely preferential, but would be fascinating to know if it could be done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently learned to use lenses and experimented with various setups. I'm mostly concerned about the Haskell record namespacing issues; this gist from 2017 offers a makeFields (& variants) based solutions but requires centralizing lens declarations which I'm not a fan of. It forces you to extract out datatype declarations from their Module into Module.Types or Types.Module to avoid circular dependencies, which is time-consuming and adds avoidable complexity to the project's directory structure.
 I've written a short guide showing:
  
The detailed pros and cons of using generic-lens, DuplicateRecordFields, OverloadedRecordDot and NoFieldSelectors
 The minimum code required to use take advantage of those tools
  
If you're looking for a modern lens setup or way to deal with Haskell's record namespacing problem I recommend checking out this guide. I've tried to make this guide beginner-friendly so I think it should be a decent reference to start using lenses for the first time.

 If you have any correction or suggestion I will gladly add them to the tutorial!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm going to start over. I've got mu4e working with reading multiple email addresses, I've got contexts I can send from, and I've got random bugs and gotchas that I'll never find in the rats nest of read-envelope-from sendmail-extra-arguments and other options. Bonus points if the guide explains what the options are doing.
 All the guides I've gone through seem to run out of steam before actually sending and responding to email -- it's all... look, I configured IMAP... and for gmail cause that's hard. But responding to an email and automatically changing the from: based on the to:, etc are barely touched on. (currently my to: lines gets overriden by my from: lol -- the amount of side-effects from any change are massive).
 ​
 TL;DR: I'd love a complete guide for setting up multiple email addresses, that includes responding to emails and sending from the correct account with the correct .sig etc. (The stuff generic clients do automatically)
 ​
 Thanks. I've spent an ungodly amount of time on this. You'd think these packages would include 1 complete example that you could pair down to your needs, rather than parsing blogs from the last 20 years and seeing what still exists, what actually works, and then checking out the random bugs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing with Scala, trying to see if I like it and if I am willing to invest more time into it. I would like to use the cfor macro from Spire in a numerical code snippet where performance is important, but how should I do it? The canonical way seems to be to add the library to the build.sbt file, but here I am not writing a full project, I am just playing with the REPL to get a taste of the language, so there is no build.sbt file. Surely there must be some easier way to use libraries, right?
 (And, in general, if one just wants to have fun solving problems from "Project Euler", so just writing code snippets in the REPL, or in some light text editor and then compiling them, how does one do it? It seems that the first steps in the Scala world must be Coursier, SBT, Maven etc., which makes things very professional and kills all the geekish fun. Is there a way to avoid them? Downloading the standalone Scala compiler is easy, but how does one deal with foreign libraries?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone know of any online courses/MOOCs that use Haskell but aren't dedicated to learning Haskell? I'm looking for a course where the content is about an interesting, language agnostic concept (databases, networking, compilers, anything really) and the course just happens to use Haskell as the language for the projects. A course where knowledge of Haskell is a prerequisite, not a goal. My searches so far have only returned results for the latter.
 I took an OCaml class in college, and I've worked through some Haskell books. I'm at the point where a "learn Haskell" course wouldn't provide much benefit to me. I'd like to apply my knowledge to a real project, but for some reason I'm just not creative enough to come up with personal projects out of thin air. Looking for a more guided/structured way to build an actual Haskell project.

 Is this a documentation error or user error? I just want to be able to use unboxed vectors for a newtype newtype X = X Int.
 The full example, copied verbatim from the above link, as follows:
 ``` :set -XTypeFamilies -XStandaloneDeriving -XMultiParamTypeClasses -XGeneralizedNewtypeDeriving
 import qualified Data.Vector.Unboxed as U import qualified Data.Vector.Generic as G import qualified Data.Vector.Generic.Mutable as M
 newtype Foo = Foo Int

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often have two side by side windows and, in my case, the right one shows the output of something in the left one (an error, or the result of a function). I'll want to see that error or output and then get back t my side by side arrangement and continue right where I am in the first. Currently, I switch to the other window with ace-window o (C-x o in my case) then mazimize that one with zoom-window-zoom (bound to z in my case). The nice thing with zoom-window-zoom is that it toggles... so z again unmazimizes the window. Then I C-x o again to get back to the first window. So, to fill my screen with the other window: C-x o, z, z, C-x o. Muscle memory at this point. But I want to be able to hit one key and maximize the other window, and hit it again to unmaximize the other window, and have my pointer where it was in the first window at the end. I'm not attached to ace-window or zoom-window-zoom... they were just what I happened across. I realize this may be more complicated if I have more than two windows open, but I very seldom do. Thoughts? And Thanks!
 PS - I have a lot of rebindings so knowing the command a suggested binding invokes is helpful.

 Note that Emacs recognizes "\\.[ds]?va?h?\\'" as verilog-mode, which includes both verilog (i.e., *.v) and SystemVerilog (i.e., *.sv, *.sva) files.
 "hdl_checker" works for both Verilog and SystemVerilog files. so when I open ".sv" file `:server-id 'lsp-verilog` (i.e., hdl_checker) is initialized by default. 
 How do I switch between svlangserver and hdl_checker for systemverilog (.sv, *.sva)?
 Thank you for your time.

Any ideas what I can do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, get-tested is a CLI tool that reads your cabal file and takes the tested-with stanza to generate a build matrix for GitHub Actions. It's fairly basic at the moment but I've already migrated a couple of projects to it, and it really is nice to have. Positive points:
  
You have one source of truth regarding the supported compiler versions for your projects: your cabal file. 
 No codegen is involved! You do not have to occasionally re-generate your CI file, which means that you can keep all the peculiarities and weird hacks you used to have. This tool only concerns itself with providing a list of OS and GHC versions. Some of which you can still exclude in the action file.
  
Coincidentally (or not), the next release of Flora will bring this stanza to the forefront (see associated announcement).
 Since the idea is to really be intertwined with the Haskell Github Action, the list of supported compiler is shared between this tool, the setup action and Flora.
 My thanks to David Christiansen for the idea of the CLI tool. The idea for it is to both disappear inside the future cabal status command, and that it becomes part of the official Haskell actions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The variable gc-cons-threshold is the threshold beyond which Emacs will run garbage collection. So if more memory is allocated than this (in bytes) the garbage collector runs. The default value is 800000 - just 7.6MiB! Starting Emacs and looking at gcs-done gives 67 for me (the garbage collector has run 67 times) and (emacs-init-time) gives "5.464376 seconds".
 At the start of my init.el, I've put:
 ;; Don't collect garbage while initialising. (setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum) 
 And at the end:
 (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 1024 1024 100)) ; 100 MiB 
 You could also put (garbage-collect) at the end to collect garbage if that tickles your fancy.
 Now gcs-done is 12 (for some reason), and (emacs-init-time) is "3.598263 seconds", which is a decent improvement of nearly two seconds. I have a very heavy and badly-written configuration file, so I need all the help I can get 🙂.
 You could probably get away with higher values of gc-cons-threshold, but bear in mind that the larger the threshold, the rarer the garbage collection, but the longer it takes. So you might end up with tiny but noticeable pauses while you're typing, which would be annoying. Not sure about that so it's worth experimenting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello dear Scala community !
 I have a very dumb ( or not, I am not sure ) question.
 Recently at work we kinda started a debate on how to handle errors in our applications : we use tapir + http4s and cats-effect's IO everywhere and current urrent practice is to throw everything in the IO's error channel and eventually catch it somewhere upstream. 
 But by switching to mainly using http4s clients to sttp clients to communi6between our services we often find our business logic kinda sandwiched between a source of data producing IO[Either[E,A]] and an API description which expects the same.
 Lifting everything into the IO error channel to caste it again into the same input shape seems to be a waste of information and effort, while also not getting any help from the compiler to handle those errors. This kinda leads me to lean toward using EitherTs....which is metwith some resistance as it does tend to add some complexity to the code.
 In this context I found out about this wonderful article https://guillaumebogard.dev/posts/functional-error-handling/ which seemed to reflect exactly my own...erm...reflexions. After reading it, I thought I found the perfect middle ground ! Put errors not in the output type of your functions, but give it the capability to fail thru MonadError from cats and Raise from cats-mtl. Maybe lift everything into a neat context function type an bam everyone is happy.
 I started experimenting. Everything was very neat and tidy until....and here comes my dumb question....where do I get MonadError and Raise instances for IO ? Is there another lib ?
 I found tofu which seems to cover pretty much anything I need but they don't publish for scala 3. Do I have to rewrite both for the IO monad ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been reading gnu's manul on elisp recently. In sort function, it talked on sort being destructive.
  
(setq nums (list 1 3 2 6 5 4 0)) ⇒ (1 3 2 6 5 4 0)
 (sort nums #'<) ⇒ (0 1 2 3 4 5 6)
 nums ⇒ (1 2 3 4 5 6)
  
Well, I understand this because it is a linked list and nums points to the cell that contains 1. To get the sorted list, we have to store the result back: (setq nums (sort nums #'<)).
 However, with doing this it said:
  
Most often we store the result back into the variable that held the original list
  
It's "Most often". So it means it's not 100% reliable, right? And why is that? I suppose sorting a list is a fundamental functionality in most languages. If it's not 100% reliable, what is the best practice to sort a list in elisp?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[org-goto-all and org-goto are probably my most used commands since I take a lot of notes. However, I have so much headlines that it takes some effort to narrow them down (headlines with similar words, so I end up parsing through lines of headlines to dig for what I'm looking for).
 Some headlines I don't need to org-goto-all, but I still it to use it as a headline for styling and if I'm in the file, org-goto is still useful.
 For my purposes, perhaps excluding headlines from an entire file and then whitelisting some significant headlines I want to org-goto-all is perfect. I've also heard of people having performance issues from too many headlines, so being able to exclude some from org-goto-all should alleviate this and allow quicker way of finding what I want. I could split into more files and just jump to them and org-goto, but I have a massive todo.org file and it has content relevant to what I'm looking for in addition to notes in a file-specific file if it has one. 
 I'm open to any approaches as well. I use org-ql/org-super-agenda but only as a custom org agenda (it's from a template that I tweaked a little, I don't know any elisp).

And then when I C-c C-c to send it comes from the wrong (default) email address... even though the name part stays correct. So somehow the email to send from is getting clobbered at send time.
 ​
 I've tried so many things with various results, I know people will want all my configs but I'm just wondering where else to look that can potentially cause a clobbering. message-sendmail-envelope-from set to nil to make sure user-mail-address used -- but nothing seems to matter from the sending side. (using msmtp on the send side)
 ​
 Thanks for any and all info. Or maybe just a guide that focuses on sending from multiple emails -- all the guides seem to say to skip right over the sending side of multiple emails and aliases.

So I wrote a little python code in org mode blocks (why not a .py file? just because I like org) to create another .org document with the sql database tables for a quick overview and not having to exit emacs. So now I like to build a function in emacs-lisp to execute the code blocks in the org mode file to automatically generate the tables when you call it, but I'm very new to emacs-lisp and don't know where to start. Any suggestions for that? . 
 Is there a package that does something similar?

 I am trying to find a way to replicate the bracket behavior to the dollar sign symbols (just as if $$ was something like {}).
 This is because I use org-mode to write math notes with a lot of latex sections and most of these latex "windows" are done by surrounding the piece of text with dollar signs.
 eg: $\alpha\beta latex things$.
 Of course the best would be to have a way of setting this to any kind of couple of symbols or symbol combinations.
 For example in latex it would be immensely useful to do it on \{ and \}.
 Does someone know how to approach this?
 I use doom emacs if that matters, but I hope that a solution might be helpful to whoever needs it as well.
 Thank you a lot.

Given the current state of Scala, this FLIP proposes to deprecate all Scala APIs in Flink 1.17 and remove all Scala APIs from Flink 2.0.
  
Why are these guys leaving ?
 Don't they know just how amazing Scala 3 changes are ? They should just upgrade to Scala 2.13... then 3.0... then 3.1... then 3.2. Joke is on them. They will miss out on all new awesomeness.
 Don't they know about the awesome optional-braces syntax ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question about the undo and redo workflow (mostly org-roam). Undo often deletes a lot of changes for me. There doesn't seem to be any caching of steps between escaping.
 Example:
  
Write code and an explanation below.
 I mark the code to copy it, but when I hit "y" there is only this little y where the code once was. Forgot to escape.
 When I now use undo, the whole text resets to an almost ancient state, sometimes from 10-30 minutes ago.
 So I have to redo-undo.
 Now I'm still stuck with the y instead of the code and I have two options: 
 Type all again from the ancient state.
 Type the code again, I accidentally deleted by pressing y without escaping first.
 
  
Is there any way I can prevent this time-consuming mess? It can't be that everyone who works with Emacs constantly loses text / code and hours of work. So the fault must be on my side.
 I read through the undo chapter of Emacs and a few threads here in Emacs on reddit. (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Undo.html). But I can't really make sense of it.
 How do you prevent this from happening? What is your workflow for undo and redo?
 I am very grateful for any help.

 Is there any way to specify value of tab-width for specific columns?For example, I would like to have tab for first column be 4, for second it would be 10, for third it can be 2 and so on.
 I checked the csv-mode, but the files that I am working on are not pure .tsv.
 First part of the file is actually free text, then there are tab separated values. So aligning the columns with csv-mode creates veeery long columns(which is totally unreadable), due to long lines of text in the beginning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to recreate the basic examples from the purescript-argonaut-codecs package. My Main.purs is like
 type User = { name :: String , age :: Maybe Int , team :: Maybe String } userDataString :: String userDataString = "{\"name\":\"John\",\"age\":25,\"team:\":\"Red Team\"}" main :: Effect Unit main = do case decodedUser of Left err -> log $ show err Right user -> log $ stringify user where decodedUser = (decodeJson =<< parseJson userDataString) -- :: Either JsonDecodeError User 
 Which will print, as to be expected
 {"name":"John","age":25,"team:":"Red Team"} [info] Success! Waiting for next file change. 
 When I remove the comments of the type annotation however, to match what the argonaut example does, it will fail with
 [1 of 1] Compiling Main Error found: in module Main at src/Main.purs:40:35 - 40:39 (line 40, column 35 - line 40, column 39) Could not match type { age :: Maybe Int , name :: String , team :: Maybe String} with type Json while checking that type t0 is at least as general as type Json while checking that expression user has type Json in value declaration main where t0 is an unknown type See https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/errors/TypesDoNotUnify.md for more information, or to contribute content related to this error. [error] Failed to build.) 
 What am I doing wrong? Is there something I misunderstood? I'm new to PureScript, but have some experience with functional languages.
 Edit: Never mind, after decoding Json to User, I forgot to change the serialisation function from stringify :: Json -> String to show which uses the inherited Show instance of the record...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand the difference/overlap between the transformers and mtl libraries. I've found a lot of information, most of which seems to be like 10 years out-of-date. Depending on the year, the advice has ranged from "definitely use mtl" to "definitely use transformers" to "it doesn't matter, they're basically the same thing".
 So here's my noobed-up interpretation of the current situation, what I've managed to glean:
 mtl is (now?) built on top of transformers, so they are in that sense "compatible". However, mtl provides some "extra stuff".
 So my questions:
  
Is that basic summary more-or-less correct?
 ...and if so, what is the "extra stuff" that mtl provides? I've read the docs, a few wikis, and a whole pile of stack overflow threads, but still am not clear. (Some type classes, I think?) Practically speaking, why choose mtl over transformers?
  
I've only used transformers so far, but am not sure exactly what I'm missing. I appreciate any pointers!

 However, doing this a few times, I end up with a lot of org-roam buffers clogging up my other buffer list. I see the names generally start with a YYYYMMDD.... prefix, and end in the standard .org suffix - I see that there is a consult-buffer-filter option, but that wouldn't be completely sufficient due to the non-standard name of these files (it'd be nice if I could ensure they all are prefixed with "or-" or some such).
 Even better would be if I could also exclude them from my recentf list, but I'm hoping for the buffers currently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Not sure whether this should be handled at Scotty level or at Docker level, but my problem is the following:
 I've set up Docker and Nginx reverse proxy on a hosted Debian VPS. I'm successfully hosting multiple websites with SSL on this VPS, including an application built with Scotty.
 The app is basically just an editor in which you can write programs in a DSL I implemented. When you press "Run", the contents of the editor is sent to the backend as a POST request, and the program is evaluated server-side. The server then responds with the result.
 The problem arises in the fact that the DSL in question allows for infinite loops. Thus, when the backend evaluates the given program, it might not terminate. When this happens, the app is down for at least a minute seconds and the process consumes ~100% of the CPU on the server.
 Is there a reliable way (in my current Linux/Docker/Scotty stack) to automatically kill the process if it runs for more than, say, 8 seconds?
 What I've tried so far:
  
Setting a timeout of 8 seconds using scottyOpts
 Defining a health check in the Dockerfile that runs every 30 seconds
  
The health check helps in the sense that it automatically restarts the container if the service does not respond, but this still yields significant downtime.
 Let me know if the post does not fit the sub.
 Cheers!

 (use-package elpy :ensure t :init (elpy-enable)) 
 I haven't figured out where to put this that doesn't throw an error on doom sync. Because I'm using doom, I have an ~/.emacs.d/ and a ~/.doom.d, which each contain various init.el and packages.el files. The packages file in .doom.d indicates packages are installable via:
 ;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror: ;; (package! some-package) (package! elpy) 
 So I've done that, and run doom sync and reloaded Doom. It seems now that elpy is installed in a half state. There are many elpy commands available in M-x such as elpy-doc, elpy-menu, elpy-test, but the reason I installed this package is that I want to be able to navigate to e.g. Widgets(foo=bar, baz=qux) in a Python file and jump to definition, which isn't working - M-. instead outputs an error, "Previous command was not evil-repeat".

 For example if you look at the screenshot here which shows lsp-tailwindcss providing a completion list.
 What is weird is sometimes I get the list but only after a huge time delay. If I do completion-at-point, I get a list instantly but it is in the mini buffer and not displayed like the referenced image.
 I don't know a reasonable method of debugging this and figuring out what is wrong.

 Ideally I'd do it using `.dir-locals.el` or `dir-locals-set-class-variables` one level above all the git repos. However it seems as soon as Emacs finds one configuration it stops looking up the directory structure. So if I have project-specific .dir-locals.el I'd need to copy my overrides from level above.
 Is there a standard way to do this? Am I missing something? I didn't even notice any mention that Emacs stops looking as soon as it finds one in the docs (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html) or anywhere else.
 The closest thing I found was this https://github.com/jinnovation/nested-dir-locals.el

 I think the problem is that the emms-track-get function doesn't retrieve the info-playing-time key/variable. I can test this by editing the emms-track-description-function to try to retrieve info-playing-time, but the track listings in a playlist buffer do not show this. 
  
 Is there any way to fix this? I'm using emms-player-mpv as the only player, could that be the origin of this issue?

 I would also accept a solution where I have to activate the spell checking manually.
 I'm not sure which one of the components are responsible here? Can eglot do something like that? OR do I have to configure the language server behind? Or is it totally in depended from the python-eglot-configuration?

 I get that tramp was built for maximum flexibility over tramp remotes, but for the most common cases, would having a server running on the remote side be able to speed things up, and perhaps provide server to emacs communication too?
 Vscode has a remote component, which I believe is written in nodejs and runs on the places nodejs runs.

Can I build GUI apps in it? Is there anything similar to electron or Tauri in Haskell? is there any TUI-related things in Haskell? is there anything else I can do using it? I like this language a lot and would like to learn the rest of it by building things.

I really loved Kotlin specifically for its hybrid OOP/functional approach and for its null-safety.

 So given a few examples that for the sake of the example all start at buffer pos 1000:
 A) " blabla"
 B) " blabla"
 C) "blabla"
 re-search-backward would correctly return 1000 for both A and B, but it's actually the return values of 1 and 3 that I really want here. I can't just remove the [[:blank:]] because I don't want to match C where there is no leading whitespace.
 So I'm wondering if there is any alternative function or grouping trick where I can search backwards for a regex but get the position of a specific group in the regex back, or similar to font-lock-keywords be able to specify a regex for leading/surrounding text.
 Similarly, given the same example A I would like to use looking-at if the point is at position 1. For now I use (and (looking-at "[[:alpha:]]") (looking-back "[[:blank:]]))

This makes me think that people don't normally ToJSON their actual models, but instead create specific ViewModels that they then map to the actual models in a Servant handler. Is this correct?
 I also consider doing some JSON -> Haskell code gen, since reverse engineering what the JSON is going to look like from a Haskell type is not obvious to me. Say a type like

 If you use Servant, what are your experiences?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not going to switch over to vi bindings, but in exploring how the other 2/3 lives, I've grown disenchanted with Emacs's keybindings for (backward-char) and (backward-word). For decades, I've used <left> and M-<left> for those navigation commands, but as I've moved away from the arrow keys in favor of C|M-{f, n, p} , I've found the b variant more and more irritating. For me, C- is caps-lock and M- sits just below x. In both cases, combining them with b makes for a very weird hand shape.
 vi's h,j,k,l navigation is interesting, but n,p make more sense to me than j,k and I use C-h, C-l and M-l enough to not want to remap them.
 I'm interested to hear about solutions to this thorn from people who don't use vi bindings.

 Similarly, all my Emacs life I simply ignored eww. I knew it existed, but I never tried using it. I just didn't understand the point. I would always use "the big browser" and complain that it's sad Emacs doesn't have one.

In fact, it’s better than any of the rubbish they shovel at you, but let’s not get too evangelistic. I’m running Doom Emacs on a Mac (using Macports as a package manager), and although there are some guides out there on getting Emacs to work with Unity, most of them didn’t get everything working for me, so I thought I’d write this guide to help others out. To use Emacs effectively with Unity means setting up LSP Mode integration. In order to do that, you’ll need a language server for C# and a way to generate .csproj files. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to test if the former is working without having the latter up and running. Let’s set up project file generation first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got this
 round' :: Double -> Integer -> Double round' num sgnf = (fromIntegral . round $ num * f) / f where f = 10^sgnf 
 And I'd like to nail down exactly why the fromIntegral is needed. The obvious thing to do is find out what types round is dealing with, i.e., round :: (RealFrac a, Integral b) => a -> b , and then assume it doesn't work to try to divide the outcome of round by a integer. And don't be fooled when the naked literals, e.g., 844.666 / 100 do work, since it's really fromRational 844.666/fromInteger 100. Which is not what (round $ num * f) / f is giving us. So round results in an Integral, (round 844.666 :: Integral b => b) , which needs to be passed to fromIntegral. But now I'm confused. Integral is a class. Can someone explain exactly what's going on here?

I actually enjoy the auto-revert behavior on my local machine, but the aforementioned behavior was making visiting files very slow on some servers I work on. I don't know if I've overlooked an easier way to do this (I've tried a few) but I've settled on the following method using advice, I thought I'd share this in case it's useful (or if there's a better way out there).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: to make it clear, I am asking whether anyone knows of a mode that would be better than lisp-mode.
 I'm currently using lisp-mode for The Knowledge Machine .km files, but it is not indenting things the way the documentation shows it. For example, this is how the handbook represents the following:
 (parts has (instance-of (Slot)) (domain (Physobj)) (range (Physobj)) (cardinality (1-to-N)) (inverse (part-of)) (subslots (mechanical-parts body-parts))) (mechanical-parts has (instance-of (Slot)) (superslots (parts))) (wheel-count has (instance-of (Slot)) (domain (Vehicle)) (range (Integer)) (cardinality (N-to-1))) 
 but when I indent the region containing it in lisp-mode, I get:
 (parts has (instance-of (Slot)) (domain (Physobj)) (range (Physobj)) (cardinality (1-to-N)) (inverse (part-of)) (subslots (mechanical-parts body-parts))) (mechanical-parts has (instance-of (Slot)) (superslots (parts))) (wheel-count has (instance-of (Slot)) (domain (Vehicle)) (range (Integer)) (cardinality (N-to-1))) 
 the problem (stuff pushed way out to the right) is worse for concepts that have longer names than wheel-count. I'm sure that there must be, if not a dedicated KM mode that I simply cannot find, an existing mode that can be customized to produce the handbook formatting, but I can't find it.
 Edit 2: added a couple of more example declarations, all from page 12 of the KM user manual (pdf).

 I need this to add nodes in org-roam with spaces in the name.
 I was able to write a space on windows with Alt+Space Bar or some combination like this, but now I'm working on Arch Linux and this combination doesn't work.
 Does someone know how to disable the search for a match on space bar in the config?
 Edit: Solved by using Arrow Up Key + Arrow Right Key

 Where is the best place to change the color of the message first given when you attempt to exit an edit with changes in place, but you don't want to save the changes. Basically you just hit c-x c-v.?.
 In my instance, that text is dark blue on a black background and it is hard to read.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Staged programming consists of evaluating parts of a program at compile time
for greater efficiency at runtime, as some computations would have already been
executed or made more efficient during compilation. The poster child for
staged programming is the exponential function: to compute a^b, if b is
known at compile time, a^b can be replaced by b explicit
multiplications. Staged programming allows you to write
a^5, but have the expression compile to a*a*a*a*a.
In Haskell, the traditional way to do staged programming is to
reach for Template Haskell. Template Haskell
is, after all, designed for this purpose and gives you strong
guarantees that the produced code is indeed a*a*a*a*a, as
desired. On the other hand it does feel a little heavyweight and

 TL;DR: One Fastmail account, but several aliases/virtual addresses. So myemail@fastmail.com has addresses coolguy@mydomain.com and supercool@mydomain.com and wow@mydomain.com. The Fastmail client has a drop down for send from, and automatically sends email from the right alias when I reply. How do I duplicate this?
 I see no reference to send from or reply-to in any of the setups. Manually editing the from: line when sending from mu4e does nothing… the from and reply lines are just overwritten to whatever I have set for sending email. 
 Thanks for any help or pointing me to appropriate resources. (Setting up on Mac now, but will be xplat).

Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones. It also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for the requirements elicitation tool FRET (https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/fret/), via Ogma (https://github.com/nasa/ogma).

 The only downside is that it doesn't seem to be maintained, and doesn't work for ghc 9.
 If the authors are reading this, did they get discouraged from maintaining it because of low adoption, and how hard do they think it would be for me to update it? I'd absolutely love to use it instead of sphinx for the monad-bayes docs that I wrote here, but that library uses ghc 9

For example, I was trying to figure out how to call a function that could create a new org entry from an org template, with certain values passed in as parameters. I kept running into a wall, until I realized that I needed to set a global variable to a plist containing the values, and then access those values using elisp in the template. This would be a sure sign that someone doesn’t know what the hell they’re doing in any other language I know of, but it seems to just be how things work in the EMacs/elisp world. I can only imagine how bad my code would be if I learned by hacking on EMacs…. 
 Is this just a function of EMacs being an older system that was developed before more best practices were developed? Is there some other justification for doing things this way? Or am I overblowing how often things work like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just realized that I had a heated debate last year at a local LUG meetup here in China with one of the most active Archlinux package maintainers (whose name some of you probably know but I'd rather not mention) about the status quo of Haskell on Archlinux. It was a painful and long debate; I didn't post anything immediately after, but now that I think about it the debate eventually boiled down to, as I called it,
 A BROKEN PACKAGE IS BETTER THAN AN INSECURE PACKAGE. 
 If Haskell cannot manage to (at least pretend to) successfully update a dynamic library dependency without recompilation and/or large-scale ad-hoc per-package manual patching and/or 100x performance penalty due to uneliminated indirection, then it's Haskell's fault for doing so. Packages in other languages can get broken by security patches as well; it's just that they often (at least pretend to) work and Haskell breaks too often.
 I never realized that security patches are his first and foremost concern since he never seemed to have expressed that explicitly regarding this issue. But now it has all come together.

I know basic key chords, and I've started messing around with org mode, and I have a couple functions and keybinds in my init.el (all copy-pasted from the internet, of course). But I feel like there's a gap yet to be bridged, and I don't know where to start, because I don't feel I truly understand emacs. 
 In short, what do I have to do to progress beyond being an emacs beginner? What resources should I use? When will I be able to use emacs for everything?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's what I'm trying to do:
 I've been using relative line numbers, which are great for moving x amount of lines up/down, especially in large files. On occasion, though, I'll need to move to a specific line number (for example, if reading about a line from documentation or an error buffer). In those situations, I want to see all the absolute line numbers. My solution has been:
 (advice-add 'goto-line-read-args :before (lambda () (setq display-line-numbers 'absolute))) (advice-add 'goto-line :after (lambda (_LINE &optional _BUFFER _RELATIVE) (setq display-line-numbers 'relative))) 
 This works perfectly. However, some times I change my mind after calling goto-line, and decide to do something else instead. When I quit out of goto-line (C-g), the second advice doesn't get run and I'm stuck with absolute line numbers. Obviously it's not much of a pain to set them back to relative, but I'm wondering if there's a way to do it automatically.
 I'm also asking because I'm trying to get more familiar with how the advising functionality works, and I'd like to understand if there's a way to get out the quit issue. It seems to me that sometimes there are advices that need to run, even if the function has been quit. Is there a way to make sure that happens?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I programmed in Haskell for many years, but eventually switched to Rust a few years ago on the lure of it being a kind of poor man's functional language, but with absolutely kickass performance. 
 The syntax is atrocious, but the compiler is almost magical, with the generated assembly resembling nothing like what I wrote in Rust (which looks more Haskelly than Rusty, with my indoctrination into Haskell years ago ...), but like what I might write directly in assembly. At this point, I am surprised when it doesn't optimize like this. 
 I never did see is kind of performance in Haskell. Despite my best efforts, when I rewrite in Haskell, it rarely gets any faster than 0.1x to 0.3x the speed of the Rust equivalent. When you need the speed and not just the language niceties, this is depressing.
 Does Haskell/GHC have a chance at hitting this kind of performance? Is it a matter of manpower/mindpower/time, or are there fundamental limitations that make this practically impossible?

 i need to go through a list of strings and if a String is an integer number (for example 78) it will be changed into the tuple ("Number", 78), and if it contains just text (for example the word "trees") it will be changed into the tuple ("Text", "Trees")
 to keep it simple assume that any string passed into the function can only be integers or just plain text, but they are all Strings

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy! I originally posted this question on r/linux, and it was suggested to post it here as well.
 I'm installing Gentoo, and I'm looking at either StumpWM or EXWM as a WM, and I'm leaning toward EXWM simply because Emacs. However, I'm sure there's a lot I don't know about the comparison between them. I'm wondering if you nice folks might share your insights.
 I use Emacs a lot, and plan on using it more and more as I get my config dialed in. I'm fully invested in Emacs, and consider it to be part of the OS, so I'll be using it either way. I think having more stuff in Emacs is nothing but handy. I will be using this setup on several PCs, including a crappy laptop, a gaming laptop, and a few desktops. Gaming is the main thing I'm worried about. I just use KDE on the gaming laptop for now.
 I'm also interested in programming, specifically in Lisp. I'm leaning more toward Common Lisp, which is what StumpWM is written in. Of course EXWM is Emacs Lisp, but that's kind of Emacs-specific and wouldn't be used for other software development. I've also considered learning scheme because I have a copy of SICP, but that's taters under the skillet.
 Finally, I'm a few months away from getting going on managing a homelab. None of the servers will run this system, but all of the management will be done through it on my main PC. I will be doing a lot of multitasking, troubleshooting, remote-management, security stuff, note-taking, etc.
 So, in a nutshell, I'm wondering: - What can StumpWM do that EXWM can't do? - What can EXWM do that StumpWM can't do? - What are the major limitations of each, specifically when compared to one another? - How will each compare when stacked against the things I want to use it for? - How does the ecosystem for each one compare? I know the Emacs ecosystem decently well, but not StumpWM's. Are there many plugins / extensions? Are there many users communicating regularly with each other?

 I've done evil-tutor but it's pretty limited. I'm in the situation where I'm trying to use vim keybindings because they hurt my wrists less than chords. I'm okay with hjkl, c, d, r, i, a, f, w, b but other than that I'm pretty clueless.
 I don't want to read a bunch of vim tutorials only to find out they use a bunch of packages that work different than evil. And I'm looking for the common editing operations that aren't included in evil, like parens or s-exp manipulation.

 Note, it doesn't seem easily possible to compile Emacs 28.2 on Debian 9, so I had to upgrade one of my machines to Debian 10 for this to work.
 To compile and install the Emacs packages except for the info manual:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a long research I came to the conclusion that probably the best way to build Haskell projects is to use Nix + Cabal as described in this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/7h8np7/stack_or_cabal_which_one_is_more_preferable_for/dqp268b/ or https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/tvbrmp/stack_compared_to_cabalinstall/i38g4my/ and some blog posts around the internet.
 This gives you all the advantages like binary caches (no need to compile dependencies), incremental builds, non-Haskell dependencies and other things you would expect in a modern build system. Stack was an attempt in that direction but is generally considered inferior compared to Nix + Cabal.
 So why isn't there a tool that simply combines (or automates) the setup of a local nix environment + cabal + cabal2nix? 
 I think we could even achieve something like "npx" or "pipx" that allows us to run a Haskell application with just one command, e.g. "hpx pandoc" that installs and runs Haskell application for you on the fly.

 org-ql-search working terrific for me in searching agenda files and open buffers. However, am trying to figure how to search recursively in a specific directory and have that show up in the Buffers/Files: options along with org-agenda-files and org-directory.
 My org files folder structure is not flat, so the straight org-directory variable isn't working for me as I think searches only the folder specified.
 (I do use deft right now, which filters down files but the grouped results buffer of org-ql would be a lot more helpful)
 Any pointers very much appreciated.

The trouble with this is that for a given project, say, the notes for it are spread all over the file, I want to bring them together. Enter org roam.
 I have a file per entity (person, project, journal, interview) and most entries are dated. Each week I like to review whats gone on and write up some conclusions, using the journal this was easy, but now not so much.
 Is there a way to search my org dir, for a date range (last week), and pull together all of the matching nodes, and display them with the title and file tags from the orignal files? Been reading about consult this morning, and that sounds like a possible route, but figure I'd ask for some guidance. 
 I guess I could go the other way, just use a journal and tag each node, and pull together the entity nodes adhoc, but that would rely on being very consistent with tags, which seems more error prone to me. Happy for any tips if others go this route.

Since matrices correspond to linear mappings, we can also conclude that linear mappings form a noncommutative ring where the multiplication operation is function composition. What will the addition operation be? (Hint: it’s the linear mapping analogue of matrix addition.)
  
I guess it's the sum of two applications of linear mappings, like so: f(x) + g(x), where x is a matrix.
 Am I correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can someone please tell me how can I force #'completing-read to search not only in the displayed rows, but also within annotations?
 Consider a trivial example such as this:
 (let* ((coll '(("Affenpinscher" . "Loyal and amusing") ("Akita" . "Ancient Japanese") ("Bulldog" . "Kind but courageous") ("Caucasian Shepherd" . "Serious guarding breed") ("Miniature Schnauzer" . "Long-lived and low-shedding"))) (completion-extra-properties '(:annotation-function (lambda (k) (let ((desc (alist-get k minibuffer-completion-table nil nil #'string=))) (format "\n\t%s" desc)))))) (completing-read "Select a breed: " coll)) 
 Evaling this snippet would display names of the dog breeds, along with annotated descriptions. And if I type "sheph", it would correctly narrow the search to "Caucasian Shepherd". But I also want to be able to type "long" and to find "Miniature Schnauzer", but sadly, it doesn't work that way. How can I change that?

 OrgModeClockingXBar - See what you are working on ;-) (if using orgmode clocking)
 I designed a hack to see your clocked-in task on your bar.
 The hack is composed of a few elements, Emacs code that adds hooks for clock-in and clock-out, a Python script to process a file with the Emacs output, and a code for Xbar.
 I have been using this for 2 years, and it's pretty robust. I didn't have time to share it before.
 The code is not perfect, if you quit your Emacs, without clocking-out the content of the file will not be changed so you will not see any update on the bar (at least not till next clocking-in or -out)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you develop Xcode projects using Swift/SwiftUI in Emacs?
 I want to use Emacs as alternative to Xcode since text editting capability of Emacs is so powerfull and I got used to it.
 It seems there are several ways to do that but each one has some issues.
  
lsp-mode is broken for swift over a year. 
 lsp-sourcekit ;; completion stops working after lsp server returns an error #3028
 
 company-sourcekit and SourceKittenDaemon doesn't work for .xcworkspace 
 Support for xcworkspace #73
 
 eglot doesn't officially support Swift and doesn't have instruction to get it working. 
 konrad1977's comment on Swift support? #825 seems promissing though.

Hello all,
 Here’s a new proposal which seeks to decouple GHC and Haddock as much as possible.
 This proposal is based on an idea by Haddock maintainers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I've been muscling my way through the various dated on-line guides, and reddit help has been so key... thank you... I'm almost there ;))
 mbsync successfully gets my email into ~/.maildir/myGmail/
 mu info shows maildir as ~/.maildir
 Email is indexed, I can run mu commands and see emails, etc.
 TL;DR: Invoking mu4e in emacs then makes the [Gmail] structure under ~/.maildir rather than using the already existing ~/.maildir/[Gmail]. (The effect is I can go to unread email, but can't jump to inbox or any directories because they aren't where the mail is, they show all empty since they're the new dirs mu4e made.)
 I have no idea where this would be coming from since I thought mu4e is just going to use the mu info. Also I was going to try to re-init mu with ~/.maildir/myGmail, but can't figure out how the hell to do (and seems like it won't work for multiple accounts anyway). I can't seem to kill mu (can't find the process), but trying to init says it may already be running.
 If you can point me toward additional info that would be great. I'm on mac homebrew emacs and mu. (Much thanks to u/FrostyX_cz blog post on getting mbsync up).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to all,
 I had the following idea: use org-mode as a chat. For exemple, if you would like to do the following: chat with someone who doesn't know org-mode well, via org-mode.
 That is, he would just have to call commands like "reply to this message", where each message could be a heading, and each file a topic of discussion. The files would be in a folder that would be shared. This would largely mirror the layout of reddit replies. 
 Edit and precision : a person A would not have to be logged in to receive B's message, just like on reddit or any other modern communication medium.
 ​
 Also, the power of org-mode could be used: combined with org-babel, org-attach, org-roam etc... that would be really cool.
 ​
 Is there a package to do this? If so which one? If not, would someone like to do it with me? Is it a good idea to make a package or is there an easier way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posting here as well as maybe one of you can help.
 I have a ZSA Moonlander keyboard. With their online configurator, I set up a key to run the Emacs macro "C-x b", that is "Press Ctrl-X, then press B".
 But when I use it, it emits "x" and "b" separately.
 I downloaded the source code for my firmware and it looks OK to me:
 case ST_MACRO_2: if (record->event.pressed) { SEND_STRING(SS_RCTL(SS_TAP(X_X)) SS_DELAY(100) SS_TAP(X_B)); } 
 Taps Right Ctrl with X, waits 100ms, then taps B. Which exactly what I want it to do.
 What am I missing? I tried inspecting the keyboard events and it still looks OK to me. Dump from evtest when I press that macro key: https://pastebin.com/fJp5kyR4
 Is it executed too fast for Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, first post here. I have been a happy emacs user since I knew about its existence and now I'm a even happier user of org. My question is about org's indent mode and custom themes. Apparently, org's indent mode creates the illusion of indentation by inserting dummy '*'s at the beginning of each sub-header, and making them invisible. When I switch custom themes, most themes do not consistently set colours in such a way that those dummy stars are invisible, that is, I guess, have the background colour. I am aware that custom themes cannot be undone by design, however, as a matter of fact, some themes do work consistently correctly with respect to indent mode, notably, all sanityinc's ones. Is it feasible to isolate the relevant feature of sanityinc's themes and replicate it in other themes to fix them?

 (. bash_profile is needed to export variables for x server to work properly)
 %* is expanded to windows style filenames with \ instead of /

 Emacs.bat:  wsl bash -c ". ~/.bash_profile && ~/.emacs.d/windows-open %*"  windows-open: ```
 !/bin/sh
 echo "$@" | tr '\' '/' # see how it expands
 emacs $(echo "$@" | tr '\' '/')

 C:\Users\wisni>wsl bash -c ". ~/.bash_profile && ~/.emacs.d/windows-open "te\st lmao"" test ``` as you can see only the first word of was passed to the script (te\st) and \s was somehow escaped by the shell to just s.
 I had tried to use single quote instead of double quotes:  wsl bash -c '. ~/.bash_profile && ~/.emacs.d/windows-open %*'  but it breaks even more badly: ``` PS C:\Users\wisni> .\bin\Emacs.bat "te\st lmao"

Other apps will prompt me for permission but with EMacs it just gives an error.
 Show me where to give Emacs permission to search the Dropbox folder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm starting at a new large company shortly and I'll need to justify why I want Emacs on my computer.
 For context:
  
the new firm is a Microsoft shop - to the extent that "cloud" == "Azure" (only) and GNU Linux or Apple is not even a dream at the moment
 I'm going to be one of the grown-ups in the room, running a team of technical people, but not coders, I guess the closest concept is technology consulting (if any of my team has ever heard of Emacs I'll be surprised!)
 as a grown-up I'll not be writing much (any) code, and I'm guessing coders get VSCode, because, well, MS
 I code, so elisp will be invaluable to me to build all those little tools to actually GSD
 I'm not a windows person, so I don't have any starting points for windows-specific examples
  
So when I go in and say to tech that I want to install this currently non-approved "text editor", I want to be able to say that Emacs is so much more than an editor, but using an example that translates to a Windows tech support person.
 I thought of something like "Windows isn't just a way of displaying windows, it's an operating system" - but I'm not sure that suggesting I'm installing a whole new operating system is a good look on day one...
 Does anyone have a good way of describing (concisely) Emacs in an analogy?
 I've seen this link, but it seemed to get into arguments around web browsers and JS and answers that were for a full on discussion, rather than a quick justification like I need. Did I miss any other discussions that I should have seen before posting?

 Is there something like this for emacs? I'm on windows and have tried 'elgrep' but it just doesn't seem near as efficient as what I was using before because I have to set the directory, reg exp for files, reg exp to ignore files, etc etc... 
 Maybe there is some way to create a command to do this for me or a better/easier to use plugin out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE: You can see the quote below, but looks like google got rid of apps that sign in with "only username and password." So, wtf aside, what's the technique then? (looks like they didn't break legacy so this will only affect new setups). Thanks again.
 ​
 To eliminate possibilities and simplify I'm just sending my password in Pass "" in the .mbsyncrc. Everything installed via homebrew on mac. (following the System Crafters youtube setup instructions). The first error was:
 ---------
 ...
 Connection is now encrypted
 Logging in...
 Authenticating with SASL mechanism PLAIN-CLIENTTOKEN...
 Error performing SASL authentication step: SASL(-7): invalid parameter supplied: Parameter Error in /System/Volumes/Data/SWE/macOS/BuildRoots/d7e177bcf5/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/passwordserver_saslplugins/passwordserver_saslplugins-194/plain_clienttoken.c near line 195
 C: 1/1 B: 0/0 F: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0 N: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0
 ------------
 From (https://macowners.club/posts/email-emacs-mu4e-macos/) I added AuthMechs PLAIN to the .mbsynrc file (also tried adding SSLVersions and SystemCertificates no). After that the error is just:
 Connection is now encrypted
 Logging in...
 Authenticating with SASL mechanism PLAIN...
 IMAP command 'AUTHENTICATE PLAIN <authdata>' returned an error: NO [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Invalid credentials (Failure)
 C: 1/1 B: 0/0 F: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0 N: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0
 ------_
 But the password is verified correct so I'm very confused to be stuck so early. Thank for any light you can shed on this (or if maybe there is a better place to post this... its all about getting email into emacs). I also used the info in the mac link above to export my certificates for a root certificate, don't know if that would be related since I never quite groked certs.
 ​
 Thanks.

 I've not been able to find anything active on meetup.com - but I also guess an FP meetup would be perfectly fine too (just also couldn't find many in London).
 In-person is important to me - I am as cautious as the next person - but I'd like to bootstrap something so that when everyone's comfortable in a room again, it gets healthier as a community.
 I've got maybe 5 years writing HS, more or less as my primary off-the-clock language, so I'm not the most qualified technologist here, but can definitely speak to some of my specifics (quirks with getting performant WASM from Asterius, fun quarantine games built on IHP, music gen, etc).
 I've never dabbled in meetups and I'm really missing a sense of community even though I work in tech (FAANG).
 So - please, any wisdom, all appreciated!
 (if I missed an already active one then job done - please just show me it :) )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm on NixOS with packages aspell, aspellDicts.en, aspellDicts.de installed. When I switch to german dictionary in emacs 28.1 via ispell-change-dictionary and try to check a word with M-$, I get the following messages:
  
Starting new Ispell process /run/current-system/sw/bin/aspell with german dictionary...done
 ispell-init-process: Error: The file "/nix/store/96n79c5sfssmn24rpfy7gvsfxcw959k2-aspell-0.60.8/lib/aspell/german" can not be opened for reading.
  
I've set ispell-aspell-dict-dir (and also tried setting ispell-aspell-data-dir) to /run/current-system/sw/lib/aspell, where german.alias and other dictionary files like de.dat can be found. Unfortunately this does not have any effect, ispell.el still tries to open the dictionary via the /nix/store directory of the aspell package (not aspellDicts.de package!) like in the messages above.
 Does anyone have any idea how to fix that?

 I specially am curious on if there are ways to reuse some code and have less repetition, or to use some more advanced features, although I must say Haskell has helped to make developing this project and refactoring a pleasure! 
 The project is meant to replace sites like CifraClub or UltimateGuitar eventually, in a community driven manner. Help me realize the dream :) I plan to create some Docker image to more easily deploy, but I am open to all ideas and suggestions.
 I also learnt quite a lot about MongoDB but it's my first time using, so it might be noticeable.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just seen the post related to the new release of Fourmolu and thought I have a look into it. 
 Unfortunately, it doesn't fit my style. However it reminded me that formatters existed (so far, I've been formatting everything manually for years) and it might be time to finally adopt one. I started investigating and the result is, they are plenty (too many ?), some which might be deprecated and none of them correspond to my style (I think).
 I mean I think because most of them are configurable and it may be possible that one with the correct configuration will fit. So my question is ; is there any formatter which will fit the following requirements (or the closest, I am even ready to modify it if needed).
 I'm pretty much only require list be aligned on (leading comma), but I don't want the formatter to add new line for me after an =. so
 myList = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] 
 (my prefered way) or 
  myList = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] 
 If I have myself started [ 1 on the new line.
 function call like this (when too long)
 function arg1 ( other_function x y ) arg3 
 I do record like this (or equivalent)
 MyRecord = MyRecord { x :: Float , y :: Float } 
 But the most peculiar thing I do is have a trailing let, ie
 my function a = let x = a+1 y = a+10 in x*y 
 and I can't find any formatter allowing it. I'm surprised nobody is doing it because it works really well. It's compact : save one line and one level of indentation and neat to read.
 The rest, I don't really care , I don't need import to be sorted or case to be aligned etc . In fact I just need the level of indentation to be correct : children of things (list element, argument, etc eee) all with the same identation, but first children inline with the parent.

 So I’ve been using Doom now for 1.5 year. 
 I use emacs daily for notes in org-mode, magit, dired and occasional Python programming, but without lsp support as I can’t get it working inside a dev container. 
 All of my “customizations” are just modules I enabled with corresponding flags in doom. 
 I really like the doom experience but I can’t help to feel somewhat stuck as whenever I get some lisp error or want to change something I’m just lost and have no clue what to do. 
 In all other areas of programming I would never accept this, but I just find it so difficult to reach the “next” level and don’t exactly know how. 
 I’ve considered trying a Vanilla eMacs experience for the sake of learning, but then all my productivity would be lost. 
 What was the best thing you did in order to advance to an intermediate level as a beginner?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 i haven't used Org / org-contacts for managing my contacts for years, and with so many other commitments on my plate, i no longer have the resources or interest to continue trying to maintain org-vcard, and deal with the data produced by the software of tech multinationals.
 org-vcard was my first Emacs package - i created it in 2014, even though i'd been using Emacs for decades by that point - and unfortunately, it shows. In recent times i've been trying to do some code cleanup, but to say that there are 'infelicities' - both within the code itself, and in terms of the UX - is an understatement.
 At one point i started doing some work to move to a parser based on the grammars defined in the three vCard specs (2.1, 3.0, 4.0, with differences between them significant enough to make trying to deal with them Less Than Fun), but that didn't get particularly far.
 i'd also toyed with creating an ELisp CardDAV library and refactoring org-vcard to make use of that, but that never eventuated either. (Partly, if i recall correctly, because when i first looked into doing this, there was a bug in Emacs' XML parsing; it got fixed, but the fix took a while to appear in an Emacs release.)
 If anyone is interested in taking maintainership, please contact me (Alexis) at the email address listed in the project repo.

I did not find any example to manipulate DOM or to do an action when page load such as document.ready in jquery. I did not have the chance to work with Angular or React yet so maybe I'm missing something. Is the goal of purescript to be able to develop frontends that manipulate DOM and make AJAX calls? Is there any documentation about this use case? Thanks

Fourmolu 0.8 
 Added initial support for leading arrows
 Added new multi-line-compact option for people wanting to use {-| instead of {- |
 
 Fourmolu 0.9 
 Added support for putting let definitions on the next line instead of inline with new let-style option (and configuring whether the in keyword is left-aligned or right-aligned to the let keyword with the in-style option)
 Added support for outputting with unicode characters
 Leaves the where keyword in the module header where the user originally put it
 
  
As always, thanks so much for everyone who contributed. Really awesome work happening over here.

 Thanks so much for any help. It’s always the onion of learning issues when coming back to it.
 UPDATE: I did an install with —cask so I could try running it outside the terminal. And that FIXED it. So it is indeed something with the term as some suggested, but the meta checkbox didn’t fix it.

The situation is a bit different regarding the two languages I'm learning, but I think that I maybe will end with the same solution for both languages. The first programming language is simple and similar to other programming languages I've worked in before.

 M-w does not work. M-x works, which would seem to indicate that the problem is not that windows is prioritizing the meta key for other operations outside of emacs.
 When I run describe-key, it doesn't register anything as happening when I press M-w.
 When I use M-x to find the kill-ring-save command, it shows M-w as being the assigned shortcut. And yet, nothing happens when I type M-w.

 Any ideas on whether the issue is with emacs or with windows, and how to address?

I've checked my config options, and I have ALL of the optional server capabilities turn ON and I've got `Company Clang Insert Arguments` set to `on'. I'm not sure what else to check. (Emacs 28.0.92 on Windows). 
 Second, is there a way to turn on completions for the class I'm working on without typing `this->` first? If I want a member variable and I don't remember the name, there doesn't SEEM to be something that lets me implicitly ask for just the class variables and functions. If I start a company completion, it gives me a much broader list of completions, which can be very handy, but usually the list is too big and generic.

  type Z = Some Entity -- OR type Z = EntityX instantiateFromRow :: (Int32, Int32, Value) -> Either InvalidEntityError Z 
 I'm encountering an issue when writing tests for instantiateFromRow (although I'm sure I'll encounter it elsewhere as well) in that I need to somehow verify that the result of this function is what I think it is (I'm using Hspec, for reference):
  instantiateFromRow (...) `shouldBe` expectedResult 
 The problem is that if I use Some Entity as the result type, then I have the problem that I need Eq instances for Some Entity, which I just cannot work out how to get right (I get lots of "cannot match type t1 with t2"), but if I use EntityX then I have problems with the forall t not matching the output of functions which do things like parse JSON instance FromJSON (Some EntityConfiguration).
 So I either need to find a nice way to:
  
extract the inner value from the Some existential (but this feels fraught with type difficulty in its own right);
 deriving / write Eq instances for Some Entity
 find a way to reconcile these type variables (which feels like a problem for which one needs dependent types at which point I'm both lost and screwed since Haskell doesn't really support them AFAICT).

 I need to occasionally edit Jason buffers indented with 2 spaces, when my default indentation is 4.
 However, incanting (set-variable 'tab-width 2) in such a JSON buffer has, to my surprise, no effect.
 M-x describe-variable says:
 tab-width is a variable defined in ‘C source code’. Its value is 2 Original value was 8 Local in buffer summary-fields.json; global value is 4 
 exactly as expected, but hitting tab, or even comma :-/ consistently aligns me with 4 space tabs, which is getting me down.
 C-h m gives me the mode:
 JavaScript mode defined in ‘js.el’: Major mode for editing JavaScript. 
 which also seems as expected.
 I'm running Aquamacs 3.6 GNU Emacs 25.3.50.1
 Thanks for any ideas or tips.

 Org mode is perhaps the first thing that comes to mind as a way to have this in emacs. However, org mode isn't directly extensible by the user. At least, I'm not aware of any API to define e.g. a new kind of plain list, with associated operations.
 Are there other packages that allow defining ad hoc user widgets in the same style? Recognizing patterns in bits of text, extracting info from them, and providing actions for interacting with them. This could very pair nicely with org.

 Yet EDE is prominently documented and has imenu-entries, suggesting newcomers to click and try.
 Is EDE using project.el under the hood? And if not: Wouldn't project.el warrant menu entries?

 This works great for buffers, but I wish there was an equivalent behavior of `n`/`N`, but for entire projects. I know you can use projectile to find and replace regexps, but I like the flexibility and ease of use of the `n`/`N` + macros flow.

 What I am imagining is that:
  
When I open a source code file/buffer, the notes I've taken before would show highlight in the buffer.
 I can read the notes I've taken, and travel from notes to source, under org-roam
 's help.
 The notes can record the git commit hash of the selected text if any. If I want to travel from notes to source like in 2.
 , it will show the historical file content when the notes were taken, if the file has changed.

For some games, encoding strategies in Haskell is fairly simple. But one could

Aesthetics while editing - yes you can export with org in a pretty format of your choosing, but it seems like you don't have quite as much control over aesthetics while writing. I don't really care too much about this, just something I've noted
 Line wrapping in table fields - in Notion I make heavy use 2 column tables that have tens of rows, and line wrapping works seamlessly. It seems like org tables don't really support line wrapping. I read about a few possible solutions but they seem a bit like they are going against the grain. This is probably the biggest holdup that might stop me from transitioning
  
Is there anything else I'm missing? I don't care much about #1, but I'd also love to hear solutions to #2 if anyone has any.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering how I can use emacs lisp to change the way text appears in the buffer (without actually modifying the underlying text). Essentially I want to include a "label" of sorts. 
 Specifically, I create presentations using RMarkdown and xaringan (which use remark.js on the backend) in Emacs. Three dashed lines (e.g., "---") marks the beginning of a new slide. At every occurrence of these three dashed lines, I want to display the slide number. So the buffer will look like this:
 ```
  
Header for first slide
 content
  
Header for second slide
  
Header for third slide
 ```
 And what I want the the buffer to look like this:
 ```
 --- Slide 1
 Header for first slide
 content
 --- Slide 2
 Header for second slide
 --- Slide 3
 Header for third slide
 ```
 So after I type "---" with a line break, it will add the slide number. The trick is that I can't actually insert the text though because in order for xaringan to properly break slides, there cannot be anything after the three dashes, not even a line break.
 How can I do this? If I am in a git project, I can see that magit includes the "+" character at the end of the line without actually modifying the plain text, so this has to be doable, right?

This reminded me, that the script needs a way to interpret and distinguish events from tasks. Rather than just program it to how I setup and use orgmode, I decided to get some feedback from other users first. 
 So how do you do it? And do you think a consensus could be reached?

I.e. we replace the interpreter with an actual machine and use the elisp code as our kernel/os.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand the first part of the second line -- which osascript > /dev/null 2>&1 && -- in the following script, from this Tips And Tricks page, to start emacsclient on MacOS:
 #!/bin/sh which osascript > /dev/null 2>&1 && osascript -e 'tell application "Emacs" to activate' emacsclient -c "$@" 
 .My (very meagre) understanding is that the script does the following three things:
  
Check that osascript is present
 Launch Emacs (which I guess it is assumed should have a call to (server-start) in its init.el or .emacs), but only if osascript is present,
 Run emacsclient
  
Is that right? If so, I have two questions:
  
Exactly how does the "but only if" in my point #2 above work? I assume that if the which osascript fails, then the call to osascript -e never happens. But how is that done? Something to do with the && I presume?
 Why is the script author making only the call to oasscript -e conditional on a successful which osascript? Why don't they also gate the emacsclient line itself? (In other words why don't just they kill the whole script if the which fails?) I might have understood letting the emacsclient line still run, even if the which had failed, but only if the author had included a -a option for emacsclient. Then, even if the failed which did blocked the call to oascript -e which in turn meant there would be no Emacs launched (and so no call to start-server), still emacsclient could have launched the alternate editor it had been given using -a. But as it stands, it looks like emacsclient will still valiantly attempt to launch even though it is almost certainly doomed to failure through lack of an emacs server.

 So my question is - if I use flycheck, am I gimping myself? Does eglot also seamlessly work with flycheck, ivy, etc. because they all secretly use the same data sources or something?
 It's also got me thinking, is flycheck way better than flymake? I kind of cargo culted my current set of packages.

It would be nice if company was smart enough to remove the trailing file name. Is there a simple solution here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never quite figured out how to search for Info nodes reliably in Emacs. I understand that Emacs is self-documenting and that the Info system is very comprehensive, so I always try to use Emacs and Info to search for answers before resorting to a web search. However I sometimes find it quite difficult to find what I need which makes me feel like I'm missing something.
 I was reading the Emacs development mailing list this morning and came across messages about "EUDC", but I didn't know what that was. So I hit C-h i to run info.
 I first tried m to select a manual, but EUDC did not appear in this list. I assumed that it would be part of the Emacs manual, so I tried to select "Emacs" from this list but that too did not appear. I closed info and instead hit C-h r to run info-emacs-manual and I then searched through the list from m for EUDC but found nothing. I then tried i (Info-index) but again EUDC did not appear in the list.
 I then tried a (info-apropos) but again nothing was found for "EUDC". Finally I got somewhere with s (Info-search); this took me to a page "33.4.2 Mail Header Editing" which had a comment about EUDC at the very bottom. There finally I saw the text "see EUDC (eudc)" which was a link to the correct "Emacs Unified Directory Client" info page.
 As you can see, my method for finding the correct Info manual was far from optimal. My question therefore is, what is the correct way of finding manuals like this using Info in Emacs?

 This morning, like most mornings, I once more began the process, like many of y'all I imagine, of struggling, tussling, and generally wrestling with Org mode, in the quaint belief that one day soon I will finally bring the brute -- and my organizational life -- under control, and that way find joy, harmony, eudaimonia, and maybe even release from Samsara. On that day -- O Frabjous Day! -- I will have won the battle over chaos and the tyranny of umpteen calendar events, a thousand post-it notes, ten thousand notebook jottings, and an uncountable number of ideas that spin around my poor brain. On that day -- Callooh! Callay! -- I will be at peace, and my ToDo list will finally respect me.
 And then I noticed this:

 Forget Skynet; forget LaMDA; and forget Ava, that hot robot chick in Ex Machina. If anything is sentient, it's Org mode and resistance is useless. Valar Org-hulis. 😩

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I just installed Scala today for the first time, and thought I'd give it a whirl. My Scala version is 3.2.1, which should handle even JDK 19. However, during cs setup, cs installed JDK version 8u292. It might not be a big deal, but when I start off with a clean slate, I like to run the newest of the new to be able to take full advantage of the latest features, should I feel like it.
 What's the "correct" way of changing the JVM version used by Scala, so I can use the latest version? Do I manually download and install the JDK of choice? Can one of the CLI tools do it for me, like NVM (Node Version Manager) for node?
 Thank you for your time!
 Edit: Understandably, when I didn't specify it, it's easy to assume I'm on linux, but I'm on Windows 11! Sorry for not including that in the original post, but I don't really think it matters regardless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Expand region may be my most used thing in emacs yet it's a bit frustrating out of the box. I know there's ways to 'advice' the command to expand in certain ways, there's 2 specific things I want:
 On assignments/expressions
 I'd like expansion to always select the expression first but it seems to work backwards e.g. with this region
 a = b[c] ^ 
 expanding again leads to this
 a = b[c] ^^^^^ 
 instead of
 a = b[c] ^^^^ 
 On vterm/truncated lines Assume that the screen ends at col 5 with this
 barbaz foobar\ qux 
 If the region is currently foobar but the actual full string is foobarqux, expand region will go back and select all the way to the top of the buffer instead of the remaining part qux.
 TL;DR How can I bias expand-region to select forward instead of backward? Also to stop on newlines and not default to the entire buffer when it doesn't seem to know where else to go?

 Sometimes if the ctrlf minibuffer loses focus for some reason (does not just happen when I use my mouse), it will remain open and I cannot use C-s or C-r again until I manually click on the minibuffer to focus it.
 I would have expected C-s/C-r to focus an existing ctrlf minibuffer if it existed, but they do not, and I could not come up with a good way to implement this myself.
 Is there a good workaround for this? Alternatives to ctrlf?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a question as described in the title. I'm working a lot with Kubernetes and because of the nature of it - a lot of YAML files.
 These files usually end being a YAML file with Go or helm templates, which totally breaks parsing of said file for with Flycheck. I do appreciate all the YAML structure hints and usual errors which Flycheck would catch - but I can't figure out a way how to stop whole buffer from highlighting if YAML file contains some go template logic - or similar. I'd say the same would be true if i.e. the file would be an ERB template of said YAML.
 For context, I'm using doom-emacs, although not sure if that matters, I'd be happy to configure this even manually if needed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SimpleX Chat security has been assessed by Trail of Bits, 4 issues were identified, and 3 of them are fixed in this release.
 Some comment on Haskell cryptonite library from the report:
  
The cryptonite library is considered state of the art for cryptography within the Haskell ecosystem. However, the library’s maintenance should be strengthened and its test coverage expanded, given that it is a language standard. If the project is still developed in Haskell, consider investing in or contributing to the library and performing a security audit on it.
  
SimpleX Chat v4.2 is released with group links and many other things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently fully committed to an efficiency oriented programming workflow/setup, switching to arch linux with a standalone WM and learning VIM movements and during this new era of my developer timeline I found out about Emacs and then Doom Emacs, I almost immediately went to Doom Emacs after spending only about 2 days in GNU/Emacs as I had heard about all the cool features such as evil mode and alot of speed improvements and I have so long really enjoyed using it and I am constantly updating my configuration for doom.
 However, when searching the web for help in configuring Doom Emacs because I want to use it as my main IDE and get rid of Intellij and VScode and in my search of doing so I realized that there was very little content on Doom emacs in comparison to GNU Emacs, my initial thought was that obviously GNU emacs has been around for 40 something years while doom is relatively new it makes sense, however I noticed that even recent videos from these couple of years still mostly feature GNU emacs.
 Is there some kind of advantage to using GNU emacs over more custom versions such as Doom? Maybe more customization, better performance? Or is there maybe some kind of inherent disadvantage to Doom?
 Also if anyone has any good resources on how to configure doom extensively please share them it would be appreciated :) 
 Edit: Thank you all for your feedback and clarifications, while reading through some emacs documentation I came along Chemacs and I will take the advice to watch the emacs from scratch series whilst being able to have my regular doom emacs setup on the side while working on my base emacs setup.

 I see the New Module wizard, and can add them as individual modules one-by-one - that sort of works, but only if the project has the "use sbt shell for" all unchecked - which is what I want since it gives me best experience on single-projects.
 With that thing checked in, the project just dissapears from the modules.
 How do you use/edit microservices and setup your favorite editor if you want them in a nice single view?

 I like the default fringe style "doom" provides, they show both flycheck and git-gutter. I just want to increase the width.
 Previously, I tried git-gutter-fringe but it overrides the flycheck fringe. I checked vc-gutter file, I have not got is it using git-gutter or git-gutter-fringe.

 I am using it for my python programming projects but there are a few things that I don't know how to configure them. This is a small list:
  
Setting the python console directory and the PYTHONPATH variable for each project

 After executing a script with C-c C-c go to the point where it raises an exception
  
Thank you for your help.

 The problem is when I try to use it on a new project, the HLS server tries to start 5 times but fails without any error.
 So after 5 attempts it just says it cannot start.
 Here are the last chunk of logs HLS sends to VSCode (4 identical chunks are sent before, I just put one for sake of economy of space):

This often leaves the reader with the impression that they have to unlearn practices and concepts they already know to adopt this new paradigm.
In this post I would like to try a different approach, not requiring any programming knowledge, but only the most basic intuition. We will build on high school mathematics, in the form of sets and functions, to provide a learning path to understanding functional programming1.

Functional programming is a paradigm for writing computer programs based on, well, you can guess: functions!

I want to run an async process and have both stdout and stderr display to the same buffer (as if it was run in a terminal), but I want to just store stdout to a variable/pass to a lambda for use in code. I don't see an obvious way to do this from the docs. 
 The two options I see are: 
  
I call make-process without the :stderr option, and both stdout/stderr end up in the same buffer, but a process filter can't discern between them. 
 I call make-process with :stderr, and I have to provide a separate buffer for stderr
  
What I want is the combined output to show in a buffer for informational purposes, but code parses and uses stdout. This is because the commands I'm running are long running and display progress in stderr. Am I missing some obvious way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My questions:
  
why doesn't to global mode activate globally?
 
how do I get it to do that for all non-special buffers?
 
 emacs version: GNU Emacs 29.0.50
 I mostly use emacs-client.
 This doesn't happen when I run emacs by itself or in a terminal emacs -nw
 I'm not doing anything to check if the daemon is running in my config.
 Basically everything runs the same code. 
  
Since version 27 emacs has a built-in display-fill-column-indicator-mode and a global version too. 
 Early in my init files, I create a text-mode buffer named *text* (naming is hard). 
 Later on I use (global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode 1) and when I open a new (non special) buffer sure enough there's a fill column indicator over at the right hand side. Same when I visit elisp files, python files, .. pretty much everything. 
 However in my generated *text* buffer and the *scratch* buffer there is no indicator. 
 When I run emacs -nw or plain emacs works as expected and both those buffers have the indicator. 
 With emacs-client though, in those buffers, the global-minor-modes does include global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode but local-minor-modes does not include display-fill-column-indicator-mode. 
 In contrast I also have 
 (use-package display-line-numbers :ensure nil :hook ((text-mode-hook . display-line-numbers-mode) (prog-mode-hook . display-line-numbers-mode))) 
 And indeed display-line-numbers-mode is active in both the *scratch* buffer and my own *text* despite not setting those hooks until after the *text* buffer even using emacs-client. 
 How can I get this behaviour in all buffers?

 I am posting it here as (1) a followup to Cognitive Loads in Programming, (2) because IMO it is relevant to the discourse about FP and Haskell in particular.

 Is it enough to write a server that implements the ActivityHub protocol?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I have one journal file called mylife.org It has many entries like so:
  
** [2022-11-01] *** dream i dreamt of cybernetic sheep **[2022-11-02] *** dream I was in antarctica **[2022-11-03] today was meh. lots of wasted time *** dream I foiled a bank robbery 
  
I just want to export the *** dream headings into another org-mode file if possible. so that i can call it dreams.org which only has my dreams like so:
  
*** dream i dreamt of cybernetic sheep *** dream i was in antarctica *** dream i foiled a bank robbery 
  
How can I go about it in the simplest way possible? Granted I lose out on the dates, but even achieving this would be helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to emulate some features in TeXMacs, specifically how when you type "QQ" in TeXMacs, you get "\mathbb{Q}". It's really nice once you get used to it.
 I noticed abbrev-mode does basically what I want, but with a caveat: I need to insert a character before the expansion happens. So (with electric-pair-mode) I may have "$QQ|$" where | is my cursor. Then C-f afterwards does not do the expansion. This is a minor thing, but I feel like you can do a lot with this feature. I have looked through some source code (specifically abbrev.el/expand.el/dabbrev.el), and its seems detection of abbrev-table is built-in somewhere (like in the language modes themselves)? The last thing I'd want to do is add a hook to insert.
 Here is the code for abbrev-based expansion.
 (define-abbrev-table 'global-abbrev-table '( ("QQ" "\\mathbb{Q}" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ("ZZ" "\\mathbb{Z}" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ))

 His public contact information is listed on his website: https://protesilaos.com/contact/ so I'll message him directly about what methods will work best and update this post with more info if I find out.

 When I do `customize-themes` and pick for example wheatgrass, my default background isn't exactly black. I do `customize-face` and set background to black, but it does not become black. It looks like the theme continues to override my customisation. How can I enforce the black background?
 This is in terminal emacs (nox).

 When I set the CPU governor to 'Power' (i.e. tend to keep clocks low) the clocks stay at 800 Mhz and pixel scroll precision mode is very laggy, even though scrolling on chrome or firefox is completely smooth. When I set the governor to 'balance power' or 'performance', the sensitivity of clocks to load improves - CPU clocks peak at 2.7 Ghz, the base clock, for the duration of the scroll - and the scrolling becomes smooth.
 I don't know whether anyone else has experienced this and I'd like some tips on where I should post this to attract attention from developers. It's not ideal that scrolling is so CPU intensive in the first place. Very grateful though, of course, for pixel-scroll-precision-mode!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post I asked how a literal 1 gets interpreted as of type Num a => a. The answer was 1 is actually fromInteger 1, i.e., Haskell auto-magically considers naked 1 to be function call fromInteger 1. And since fromInteger is a method in Num etc., etc. Likewise 3.14 is actually fromRational 3.14 and so, likewise, the class system is invoked. But the types of fromInteger and fromRational are fromInteger :: Num a => Integer -> a and fromRational :: Fractional a => Rational -> a . But then ((fromInteger 1) + (fromRational 3.14)) :: Fractional a => a , which means the 1 got routed through Integer by fromInteger into playing well with Rational, deferring to Rational. How is this happening? The invocation of a class' various type instances is understood -- once a hint is given, i.e.,
 λ> :t (1 :: Int) (1 :: Int) :: Int 
 but this won't work
 λ> (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) <interactive>:124:19-34: error: • Couldn't match type ‘Ratio Integer’ with ‘Integer’ Expected: Integer Actual: Rational • In the second argument of ‘(+)’, namely ‘(3.14 :: Rational)’ In the expression: (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) In an equation for ‘it’: it = (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) 
 Once again, the hint-free, naked literals are playing nice with each other. And yes, if Haskell is subbing in fromInteger 1 for 1 and fromRational 3.14 for 3.14 then yes, the whole class system is involved. But how is this managed? Examples I've seen so far are helped by relying on type inference hints to route things to the proper from*. But naked literals, then adding "unlike" naked literals is a type inference that goes deeper than I can fathom. It's leveraging the class world like I can't figure out but would really like to know. It reminds of functors maybe?

 ​
 When trying to install GHCup on a fresh Debian 10 server with the standard command:
 curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh 
 I get the following error (after answering "Yes" to most of the 3 questions the installer asked):
 [ Error ] Process "sh" with arguments ["./configure", [ ... ] "--prefix=/home/<user>/.ghcup/ghc/9.2.4"] failed with exit code 1. 
 Without more details in the logs about what happened..
 Given that:
 - all dependencies requirements are ok
 - I installed GHCup hundreds of times without any problem
 I don't understand what could be the problem at this stage...
 Any help? :)

 I have a feeling its possible but there's a lot of state in play here which does not reside in emacs (X session, window manager, browser, ...)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have had an idea for a kind of program verification, but I'm not sure whether it can be implemented directly into Haskell. The simplest form of it can be phrased in terms of functions of type Bool -> Bool -> ... -> Bool.
 Consider for example the function f x y z = (y && z) || x. Suppose I want to prove the property that "if x is True, then the value of f x y z is independent of y and z". In other words, "f True is a constant function".
 My idea for proving this property is to extend the Bool types to a kind of 3-valued logic similar to Maybe Bool, but with different semantics. You could call it, say, data Partial a = Actual a | Unknown. The semantics of Unknown follow the truth table e.g. at this Wiki link. Then you could do a calculation:

 But with that, I would love to find a way that when I have to reschedule an event, Emacs would automatically reschedule everything else, e.g. due dates, time allocated, difficulty. Basically, I'm asking for SkedPal (https://skedpal.com/) as an Emacs mode. I hate to pay continuously for software and would love to stay within the Emacs ecosystem, but this is on the point of me desperately needing any possible solution.
 What's the best way to do this? Is there something already available? Could I learn Elisp and code it myself? Would someone be willing to code it?

 At university, you get taught the basics of programming in the world of OOP, such as data structures, implementation scheduling, algorithm analysis, etc. I'm interested in finding what kinds of materials are available from the POV of the functional paradigm, be it technical or more of a case studies.
 I'm interested in continuing my education one day, although, I'm not sure whether I want to remain in pure mathematics or look into specific fields in the comp sci domain.
 If anyone here has any interesting blogs or academic materials, I would be very interested to be linked to some resources for my own reading. Thanks!

 Dear all,
 As we are preparing the next release, we should make sure that no critical bugs go into the release version of Org.
 I think I have closed all the straightforward bug reports listed in updates.orgmode.org and a number of unconfirmed bug reports that were left without response.
 However, there is still a number of bugs that either require further discussion or difficult to fix (for me). Some reports may also be missing from my records.
 It would be helpful if you can help with further feedback or fixing the bug reports listed below. Especially the reports marked with [*].
 Also, if you know some bug report that is not listed below, but important to fix before the next Org release, please let me know in the reply to this mess…]]></summary>

 Is there a way to wrap consult-locate with another function or some other setting/hack to grep the results? In effect, I need to get this kind of output from the consult-locate:
 (setq consult-locate-args (concat "mdfind -name " args " | grep -v archive"))
 This obviously doesn't work, but getting that result is the goal.

Mainly pragmatism :-). I figure that if I reference a note a lot in other notes, the information in the note being referenced is "more valuable", since I keep coming back to it. I don't do tagging, and structure notes are a later addition to my Zettelkasten, and are treated as regular notes, but with a lot of outgoing links. So those two are out too. Does either of those help you in using your Zettelkasten? I'm always looking to improve this metric.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya, I recently came across the following articles which discuss GitHub actions that create GitHub releases with that include downloadable binaries for Haskell programs: - https://vrom911.github.io/blog/github-actions-releases - https://kodimensional.dev/github-actions
 Unfortunately, a few of the components used in them are deprecated (like set-env and set-output) are deprecated. I've tried reading a related article about environment files, to no avail. I'm likely not proficient enough with GitHub CI to update this myself. 
 Anyway, I was hoping someone had recently used GitHub Action to automatically: - build on linux, macos, and windows - upload artifacts to a GitHub Release
 I'd also be amenable to a similar setup in GitLab if that's been done, as I'm not really tied to GitHub.
 Bonus points if it supports static binaries on Windows, but not a deal breaker at all. I've figured out how to do static builds on Linux, and my understanding of Mac is it's nigh impossible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone gotten this to work? So far I used a hydra including this snippet to resize windows. As many others I wanted to try out transients for my keybindings. In particular I liked that I could use an infix toggle state to switch between windmove and resizing using the same keys (I guess I could also bind the toggling key to switch back and forth between different hydras too). I have used the same functions as the hydra in the link. Namely these:
  (defun hydra-move-splitter-left (arg) "Move window splitter left." (interactive "p") (if (let ((windmove-wrap-around)) (windmove-find-other-window 'right)) (shrink-window-horizontally arg) (enlarge-window-horizontally arg))) 
 The resizing more often then not fails however, because the transient window in and on itself is fixed-size and does allow neither explicit, nor implicit resizing. So every Splitter that touches the transient can't move and the command fails silently. Since this is probably a common application does somebody know how to get this to work?

What I understood was that an expression is kept into haskell program and only evaluated once it is loaded. Would it not hog up a lot of memory ? For example if I have multiple expressions of the form f1 f2 f3 ... fn a1 a2 ... am which work on lists. In this case all of them will be stored in memory and if I am using only one element from each expression at a time, others will not be evaluated and the complete logic chain would stay in memory. Would it make haskell programs less memory efficient?

I value debugging friendlyness very much (do you use traditional debugger with breakpoints etc in the functional world, or how is it done there? ).
 It can be elm or some haskell near language too.

Perhaps more accurately, I'm trying to improve my terrible Scala and wanted to know the right way to try to build an app in Scala that could do what I am currently doing using Python and Boto3. Querying S3, Step functions, etc. etc.
 Wanted to know here whether anyone could point me to how they're using Scala and AWS (or course Scala and Spark are how I generally use Scala, but now I want to use it for more and perhaps move some of my Boto3 stuff into Scala - mostly for learning purposes).
 Also, if I create an "app" that can run from the CLI, I will obviously have to also create some shell script to run the app because I need to invoke Java and all. Is there a better way of doing that?

 I started watch how to build you custom config from scratch and I tried and I like it so much. Adding packages one by one after I know they are useful for me. I learned a lot more than the 6 months with doom and spacemacs.
 Now, I want to setup evil keybinding like doom and space emacs but it's overwhelming and confusing. I tried looking into space/doom configs that involve packages I use in but I found a lot of custom functions there's no logic to the keybinding.
 My question, is there any reference that I can use as help or template in my journey to setup evil keybinding. P.s: I don't mind templates for emacs binding as long the logic is explained so I can follow the same or adapt.

At some point, it became clear that even if the sequential execution of the requests is comparable with other editors the the fact that (almost)no IO work is performed when emacs UI thread is busy ultimately chokes both the server and the client(especially for the single-threaded servers).
 Here it Emacs fork https://github.com/emacs-lsp/emacs based latest(?) release 28.1 branch that uses separate thread(s) for processing json and communication with the language server thus taking more than 95% of the load off the main UI thread. In addition, it reduces the GC pressure because some of the objects never reach the lisp layer. Compile it just like a normal emacs(make sure to have --with-modules configuration flag) and it should work with the latest and greatest lsp-mode. 
 The code is still not extensively tested and works only for Linux/Unix. With the help of https://github.com/606u we are going to add Windows support as well.

I recently discovered the Zettelkasten method and am curious, if this method would be of any use to me. I'm doubting because all the explanations I see online or in books about that method using Zettelkästen are in the field of sociology, psychology, personal development etc., and I can see very well, why the method would be useful in those fields, where finding new ideas is a crucial part of the work done there. But I didn't find a single YouTube video or alike made by scientists about that method.
So I wonder, if a Zettelkasten could be useful, as well, in fields where it's much more about facts than insight. I mean, in those fields it's much less about "discovering unexpected relations" and "coming up with new ideas", but much more about collecting data and facts and pu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to generate a static site from all my org notes. The notes are currently a mix of plain org and org-roam notes and dailies.
 So far I've tried using ox-hugo to generate everything using this snippet (using doom emacs' doomscript):
 ``` (defcli! export-org (file) (require 'doom-start) ; load doom user config (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect file) (setq org-hugo-base-dir "org-hugo-dir") (let ((org-id-extra-files (find-lisp-find-files org-roam-directory ".org$"))) (org-hugo-export-wim-to-md))))
 (run! "export-org" (cdr (member "--" argv))) ```
 Basically I loop over all org files calling this script on each one, ox-hugo however fails with an error:
  Error: [ox-hugo] my-file.org: The entire file is attempted to be exported, but it is missing the #+title keyword 
 Apparently ox-hugo requires at least a #+title property in every file... Problem is, I have hundreds of files and it would be quite tedious to add a title to every single one of them.
 So far I've considered these options:
  
I'm possibly missing some ox-hugo/hugo configuration
 Programmatically adding #+title to every file
 Switching to a different export mechanism altogether
  
Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[after staring at the definition of a functor for a while now. I believe I know the general purpose of it and I'm now trying to implement my own functor on my custom hashMap type. The implementation of the "hashMap" in question is just a nested list of lists.
 I want to implement the functor for it so I can work with commands as such :
 myMap = HMap {keyValues=(insert <*> ["hi","hello","hello world"] <$> (initialize 10))} 
 This is the structure of the custom type itself.
 data HMap a = HMap { keyValues :: a } deriving (Show) instance Functor HMap where fmap f (HMap a) = HMap (f a) type HashTable = HMap lengthsTable :: [String] -> Int lengthsTable (x:xs) = length x 
 running the above command gives me the error :
 Couldn't match expected type: [String] -> b with actual type: [b0] * Possible cause: `(<*>)' is applied to too many arguments In the first argument of `(<$>)', namely `insert <*> ["hi", "hello", "hello world"]' In the `keyValues' field of a record In the expression: HMap {keyValues = (insert <*> ["hi", "hello", "hello world"] <$> (initialize 10))} * Relevant bindings include myMap :: HMap [b] (bound at <interactive>:43:1) 
 I understand there's a type mismatch here. I've tried changing the type that my functions call. In the basic implementation of a functor for a function type, the syntax seems correct. Am I understanding this wrong?

 My Emacs running LSP and not getting parameters upon choosing a function
 Technically, I have two questions but the one in the title is far more important to me.
 So my understanding is that LSP/Company can be made to insert the parameters of a function so that the parameter names are already filled out for you; while from the no-longer-supported company-lsp, the below Gif demonstrates the relative idea:
 Company Mode inserting the parameters of the function chosen
 But, as you can see from the end of my video, my Emacs doesn't insert those parameters, just giving me an empty set of parentheses.
 My setup isn't terribly complicated, sticking to general defaults:

I'm at the halfway point. After finishing this book what should I learn? I am planning to learn typeclassopedia for higher theory (such as monad transformers). But I'm concerned that even after i do all the programs in this book. I wouldn't be doing any "real programming". Meaning, i feel like these are toy problems and i should find programs with actual substance(grounded in real world usage) so I can gather real experience. What site or book will have real coding challenges that will help me grow and mature as a programmer. My background is cybersecurity and I'd love to learn server side coding to improve my web security knowledge. Even tho this is my preference I don't mind coding a parser combinator or something else that will help me. Tldr - what kind of practical programs should i code to progressively learn Haskell back end coding and land a job.

I realised there's an 'Introduce Yourself' category in the forum, so I thought I'd say hello.
Now that I'm thinking about it, I can't remember how I discovered the Zettelkasten system. I only know that I somehow found it online a few months ago, while researching note-taking and study skills. I'm not originally from Germany, but I live here now, so the German-sounding name 'Zettelkasten' piqued my curiosity when I first saw it.
The reason I was researching in the first place, is because I knew I would start studying for a Masters in October of this year. My Bachelors experience was way too ad-hoc. I just didn't have a good system. Knowing that I wanted to have a much better experience studying for a Masters, I was determined to get a good note-taking and connection-building system in place before my studies started. After some reasearch, I realized that the Zettelkasten method was what I needed, and I've been using it actively for about a month now.
It's still too early yet to have many links between notes, but I'm starting to build a nice network, one note at a time.
The forum history has already helped me, both to understand the method and to get ideas for my own personal implementation. I look forward to future learning with you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a big Emacs fan and have loved using it for years but can't help but think there's a lot of jankiness in various language modes.
 Syntax highlighting in general is slow. Tree Sitter is an interesting potential replacement and I got it working with some languages but I got lost trying to install a language manually - ex vue tree sitter.
 Indentation can be unexpected. For example, say you are a PHP developer and you decide to try Emacs. The first thing you'd do is install some sort of PHP support, right? So you'd likely go to php-mode.
  
This is how php-mode highlights and indents my code by default.
 On VS Code, here is how it indents and formats the same code almost out of the box. Just had to install the PHP formatter. Just works.
 So then on your Emacs PHP journey you'd try to look for a better mode so you'd install web-mode and be happy because it formats it as expected. But I've experienced situations where web-mode would format in an unexpected way or syntax highlighting bugs out so I'd have to re-run M-x web-mode.
  
I seem to experience this a lot. A language mode that's just has the janky kind of feel. I also wish there was more of a standard in how things were done. As an example, several language modes define their own variable for tab width. I do understand this is a project that's been around since the 80s so cruft is to be expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am again finding myself experimenting with a graphical view after watching Bob Dotos Video on how to use Obsidian to write an essay. He seems to have a quite young Zettelkasten or at least does not make use of connection like I use. With a depth=2 a local graph by my Zettelkasten looks like this:

This is pretty typical when I browse my Zettelkasten and I am not able to get value from it. Of course, I am not practiced in using a graph view and my practice is by no means informed by a graph view. So, that could be confounders.
So, I find myself at a strange tension point: I really like using visual structures for my own Zettelkasten work. This is an example (actually from the book):

But whenever I run into the graph view I find myself unable to make it work.
I am not willing to stop challenging my position on graph view yet. I have a gut feeling that there is a blind spot I am not aware of. But I am confronted with a similar issue like many people it seems: There are no genuine demonstrations out there but just mock examples. Bob's video is a very concise demonstration on how writing with a Zettelkasten can be realised. I recommend to watch it to enrich your perspective. But the youth of his Zettelkasten makes the graph view part not applicable to my own Zettelkasten.
I filter methods and techniques by their longevity. And if the graph view cannot show its power with older and more developed Zettelkastens I don't think it is very promising to get into it. I want to concentrate my time and effort on methods and techniques that scale.
So, my question is: Are you aware of examples of graph view being used for more older and complex Zettelkastens?
Additional thought: Perhaps, the graph view is suited most to develop underdeveloped parts of the Zettelkasten?]]></summary>

 (the ... is implying there is more tests but all within the same format). I understand that when testing bigEnv, it should be True, but does the $ mean that it is testing each thing within bigEnv separately or together to equal True?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first this was gonna be a question, but I looked a little further and realized the subtleties:
You ever notice in the two ZKs Luhmann worked on he indexed notes in both of his boxes 1-N?
Ex. So, a card labeled 1 or 1-6 can essentially be found in both boxes.
What's different, fascinatingly, is how he wrote them.
In his first ZK, we saw him use a comma "," (or in English, the period ".") to branch his notes, but with the second one he used the slash "/". That way he can account for notecards 1.6 and 1/6 to co-exist in his wider note-card system.
Luhmann probably would have changed it up if he wanted in a digital system, but I cannot blame him for taking the easy way out in that switch up. It was a good way to start over but leave no zettels behind. With that being said, even if he lived a lot longer, I'm not sure he would have opted to start a 3rd physical box.
(Rather minor, but I wasn't sure if this fits more in "Workflows" or "The Zettelkasten Method" category. It was kind of a toss up for me.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all sorry for a long question that probably has an obvious and short answer.
 I'm working through the idea that you can get to the Comonad typeclass, and its NonEmptyList instance, just by roughly considering the analogy between a category of CoKleisli arrows and turning it into code. In other words extract is extract :: w a -> a and compose is compose :: (w a -> b) -> (w b -> c) -> (w a -> c). Now you can rearrange to get extract and duplicate, and add Functor's fmap.
 What I'm having a hard time with is that to implement compose for NonEmptyList is that if you start with a w a you can apply the first CoKleisli to get the b, but to get a w b to plug in to the next function you need to sort of conjure duplicate from thin air. Once you have duplicate you can go ahead and implement the NonEmptyList Comonad we are all familiar with, which "duplicates" the incoming list to its list of itself and its tails.
 The question is, isn't there a simpler, but trivial and uninteresting implementation of compose here (and hence for extend also) that instead of duplicate, simply takes the head of the NonEmptyList. As far as I can tell this implementation is also lawful as a Comonad. I am missing a satisfying way to express that the way duplicate is implemented is somehow "the right and obvious way".

 Is there some detailed documentation of how to setup flymake with different languages?
 I used this but I must be missing something.
 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/flymake.html 
 I have flymake-php installed and php-mode.
 I can start flymake with flymake-mode and get it in the menu.
 But the check does nothing, after I put in deliberate syntax mistakes in the php file.
 I tried flymake-php-load as well but that also does seem to do nothing for me.
 A flymake-running-backends also shows me nothing, which makes me think it is not really running actually or knows which backend to use.
 Do I need to install a language server or something? Or if there is perhaps an in depth guide. 
 Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I am thinking about making a set of foot pedals for Emacs. I've looked into it before and I know different people used them differently but the impression I got was that your feet are too slow and too desynced from your hands to make it worthwhile (at least without significant practice). 
 My motivation stems from my left hand getting pretty overloaded, making some sequences of C and M impractical. For example, I struggle with using binds like C-c <any key> because I tend to hold down the control while I press the next letter, so I get C-c C-<that key>. 
 So my idea would be to have pedals for priming the next keystroke to have a C or an M. So I can press the Cpedal, then hit c <any key> and get C-c key. The pedal would then need to be released in order to register another C. There would be one pedal for C and one for M. 
 I was wondering if anybody had any experience with foot pedals and how useful (or useless) they were in your workflow. Have you ever used footpedals? If so, what did you use them for in Emacs? Did you have any use for them outside of Emacs? Were they comfortable? 
 Anything helps!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm attempting to implement a very basic hashMap . The goal is to just append strings to a list at an index that we receive from the hash function.
 data HMap = HMap { keyValues :: [[String]] } deriving (Show) hash :: String -> Int hash myString = ((length myString) * 2) `div` 3 initialize :: Int -> [[String]] initialize n = replicate n [] insert :: String -> [[String]] -> [[String]] insert nothing xs = xs insert s xs = newList where newList = before ++ [s:x] ++ after (before, x:after) = splitAt (hash $ s) xs 
 This is the implementation. My approach is to replace the current nested list inside a hashMap object. It doesn't help to think about this in an object-oriented style but it makes sense to me this way.
 I run the following commands and get the following back. I don't understand why the list is unchanged. I assume it has to do with the method of using splitAt to insert a new list of strings where the split is occurring. I'd like some insight as to what is happening here and maybe alternative solutions if possible. 
 Many thanks in advanced friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if I did something weird to cause it, but I kept having problems with SyntaxError: invalid syntax - IndentationError: unexpected indent when I tried to run python source blocks. The problem came from the auto-formatting occasionally throwing spaces on a line in a way that made the interpreter freak out.
 I couldn't find a solution, so I came up with this:
 lisp (add-hook 'org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook (function (lambda () (replace-regexp-in-region "\s+\n" "\n" (org-element-property :begin (org-element-at-point)) (org-element-property :end (org-element-at-point))) nil))) 
 It chomps spaces at the end of lines which fully eliminates them from the lines that were causing problems. (it does it for all languages and alters the contents directly. I'm okay with both those things)
 I did a write up with more details and notes
 It took me a straight 8 hours to come up with the solution. Because I'm interested in seeing how other folks work I decided to post my notes from the endeavor. It's mainly just a bunch of sequential code snippets as I try to home in on the solution
 I'm still new to this. If you see something wonky or dangerous, please let me know

 for few months now I am working on my hobby Yesod project - site for teaching physics. So far I managed to implement everything I tried to and I found Yesod amazing.
 However, I am starting to have my doubts if I should keep at it or go rather with something more mainstream (I am looking at django currently). And if so, what do you recommend? I plan to make this my life-long project, so its not something I want to ditch after a year and if, by some chance, it becomes sucessfull, I do have a lot of pretty complex plans for it, so future maintainabiliy and extensibility is also a consideration.
 Here are my concerns:
 1.) Haskell currently seems to me like a botomless pit of learning. Now, I do enjoy learning it, however I would like to soon shift my main attention from learning program…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I am relatively new to this subject and thought that it would be wise to debug my thinking before progressing too far. I am having difficulty with topics and connected zettels......
From what I have read the Luhmann system:
If the above is mapped onto a digital zettelkasten, then:
The unique id becomes, say YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm
The link to an already existing topic is a wikilink
The direct link to another zettel is a wikilink
The keywords are tags
My question: assuming the above is correct, then what means within a digital zettelkasten is typically used to assign topics to the top level zettels? As keywords are tightly tailored and the top level topics must be broad by their nature, so using tags for both would be confusing.
Thanks for feedback]]></summary>

Unfortunately I only have very limited experience with Haskell and I never worked with it professionally so I cannot answer this for myself. I’m asking those who has more experience with Haskell. Did you ever see a codebase that was architected so badly that it was beyond repair or the new business requirement were just not compatible with it and it had to be rewritten? How true is that you can still reuse most of the business logic because it is ultimately pure? I’m talking about drastic architectural changes in large programs or complete rewrites.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I remember there was a library posted here some time ago that would convert between case classes if one's fields was a subset of the other, using macros.
 I would like to use it to do something like this ```Scala case class Task(id: Long, description: String) // Sql-saved class case class Comment(id: Long, taskId: Long, comment: String) // Sql-saved class
 case class TaskDTO(id: Long, description: String, comments: Seq[Comment]) ```
 And be able to split incoming DTOs into a Task that is easily storable in the DB and the list of comments that will have foreign keys to the task.
 Does anyone know the name of such a library? Or maybe have some pointers as to how to do it differently? (I considered the DTO just being a class composing the task and comment list as fields, but that feels wonky)

 Currently on the higher functions chapter, and could use some help please.
 I cant seem to wrap my head around what happens under the hood during currification. I looked through all the posts about it on here and read on the wiki and other websites but some things are still unclear to me.
 let's say we have a function add 2 3 4 when going through the process of curryfication, we get addTwo first, which returns a function that we can pass the parameter 3 to to get addTwoThree and so on.
 What I would like to know is what do the functions addTwo and addTwoThree do essentially?
 Do they return anything ? Or are those specifics in machine language and we dont know what goes on behind the scenes ?

 I'm not sure what's happening, but when using Emacs inside Tmux, I can't type an asterisk? Instead, the minibuffer says "M-O j is undefined". Anyone know what this actually means?
 Edit: I'm using uxrvt, but the same happens in xterm.
 Edit 2: Ok, at least I have a work around - holding shift and it works??!
 Edit 3: Turns out it was urxvt that was breaking. Switched to Alacritty and everything worked

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wish to record my exercise performance, but I cannot bring my laptop with me to the gym and record my performance nor do I wish to write it down and then insert it into my fitness.org file since that sounds cumbersome.
 My current process is to use Orgzly and sync my fitness.org file with my phone and I simply record everything at the gym from my phone as the following example with separate headings for each exercise:
 * Pull Ups 2022-10-21,5,10,10,15,20 2022-10-31,10,10,15,15,20 * Bench Press 2022-10-24,90,95,100,110,100 2022-10-28,95,100,100,110,100 
 I did attempt to use tables, but they don't look easy to use in Orgzly so I am currently doing the above since it is easy to input into Orgzly on my phone. However, now that I have collected several months of data for all my exercises, I wish to produce a graph of my progress for each of the headings and I am unsure how to do this in the same fitness.org file since I recorded my data as csv instead of in an org table. In addition, I was also wondering how to plot the same data from multiple headings into a single graph using my above format? I am curious to see what others are doing and if there is a better way to track performance that can sync with my files on my computer while being in a format that is easy to work with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been thinking it'd be nice to have this feature, and it shouldn't be too hard to implement. But before I go and start working on it (which wouldn't be in a while, because of previous obligations), I want to check if there's already something that does this, or comes close.
 Here's the behavior I'd like: with a simple command, I can open a new buffer that shows me a "cheatsheet" with all the keybindings I've saved before, along with their command-name and a brief description.
 Additional nice features would be:
  
ability to group keybindings by modes
 ability to filter by the current active mode(s), so that only keys/commands related to it are shown
 ability to save keybindings interactively
 ability to save keybindings easily from a mode's keymap. Something like: in the *Help* buffer's description of the mode, select any commands, and save them to the cheatsheet
  
Often it is enough to do a quick describe-mode to find the name of the function I'm looking for, but I think this feature could be particularly helpful for major modes like magit or org, which can have quite complex keymaps. It could also help people who are just starting out with Emacs.
 Do you know if a feature along these lines already exists?
 I found this cheatsheet package that comes quite close, although it lacks some of the features I'd like and (most importantly) does not automatically save cheatsheets between sessions. I haven't taken a good look at the code there yet, but I think I might use it as my starting point.
 Would people be interested in this features? Any advice/critique is appreciated :)

 I use God Mode on Emacs (vim-like modes) and I want to exit it when the comment-dwim command doesn't comment out a region, only when it does and indented comment or a comment in an empty line, so that I can write afterwards, without having to press esc.
 ​
 Maybe there is some way to add the god-local-mode-pause function (the function to get into "insert mode", so as to say) to any of the comment related functions, however, I don't really know elisp, so any help is much appreciated.
 Tl;dr: is there any way to adhere a function to another so that when I execute one, with its name, it does another one as well?
 Edit: never mind, just learned what advising functions are for.
 The code I ended up with :
 (defadvice comment-indent (after comment-indent-after activate) (god-local-mode-pause)) (defadvice comment-add (after comment-add-after activate) (god-local-mode-pause))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I just started trying to get into concurrent Haskell, and my program doesn't behave the way I would assume it should. I have reduced it to a minimal example, and I would appreciate some help figuring out the problem. Thanks in advance!
 Below is my program. Here is how it is supposed to work:
  
The program is based on an MVar quitFlag that is supposed to act as a flag: the main thread is a loop that exits if and only if quitFlag is nonempty.
 The program first launches a thread that counts up starting from 0 (see countingLoop) and writes into the flag once it gets past 1000. It also prints every number it counts.
 The main thread just loops indefinitely until the flag is set, at which point it just exits.
  
All I get is a program that never exits and prints nothing on screen, whereas I would expect it to print the first 1000 numbers and then exit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to make a minor mode for quickly entering text containing accents or diacritical marks. In this mode, I would replace the keybinding for each alphabet key with a prefix map that is only defined for the number keys. For example the keybinding for the 'a' key could be defined as:
 ﻿(cl-loop for ch across "ąäàáæåâãǎα" for ind from 0 do (define-key quick-accent-mode-map (kbd (format "a %d" ind)) `(lambda () (interactive) (insert-char ,ch)))) 
 So if the user typed "a1", "ä" would be inserted into the buffer. But if the user typed "a" following by anything other than a digit, I would like the prefix map to have a "default" action that simply performs the actions that would result in the absence of the prefix map. So if the user types "ad", then, for a typical text-editing major mode, "ad" would be inserted into the buffer.
 Is it possible to define a default action for a keymap to achieve this behavior?

 I have configured a bigger line spacing because I like to have spacing between lines to increase readability.
  (setq-local default-text-properties '(line-spacing 0.50 line-height 1.50)) 
 I use LSP peek to show references and definitions but, since I'm not using the default line height, the peek panel bottom most of the time is not visible because (I guess) wrongly calculates the panel's height.
 Is there a way to customize de panel position and/or size so I can adjust it to my config?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Zettlers,
I am currently reading the Artikel The Two Definitions of Zettelkasten and am just a couple of hundred words in. @chrisaldrich contextualises the Zettelkasten Method within the bigger picture of using practices that seem to have something in common. I am perfectly happy to admit that I do the very thing that Chris is pointing out: My starting point it the article by Luhmann and while I am aware of the history Zettelkasten Method I never saw much practical value from reading the historical use cases.
I, myself, am a pretty non-nostalgic character. My passion for the Zettelkasten Method is fueled by exactly two motivations:
Improving my personal toolbox for knowledge work.
Generating tools to help other people to improve their toolbox.
I see this as an advantage because I have little incentive to lose myself in tweaking tools or spending time on the tool for fun and joy (nothing wrong with that if you do because it aligns with your own goals, of course).
The downside of this utilitarian approach is that it creates a blind spot which can be a source of fallacies.
So, the question is: What did you learn from the history of the Zettelkasten Method? What is there to be found what is missing in the current collective thinking in the internet?
Live long and prosper

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On GitHub, a user proposed to change "ghost" to "mind":

  
Changing ghost into mind. The mind refers to the mental frame, while ghost is the soul of a dead person.


In reaction to that, I wrote the first commentary to the translation:
The Zettelkasten as the ethereal ghost that hides in plain sight
In German, "Geist" means both "mind" and "ghost". The question spelled out could be something like "Can the mind of the Zettelkasten be observed?" Or something like that. So, why "ghost" instead of "mind?"
There is great anime film titled "Ghost in the Shell". It is quite a philosophical movie that asks the question: If your consciousness can be moved from your body and brain to machine are you still considered a human or will you become a computer program? One possible answer could be: If we can move from body to body, and we are still considered human we should be considered to be ghosts that take possession of bodies.
What do the visitors see when they see everything and are disappointed? Perhaps, they feel the same disappointment of scientists who opened the scull of people to look at the human mind but see "it all": just flabby gray tissue.
To this day, this seems to be the feeling us who start their own Zettelkasten. The frankensteinian fantasy of creating something alive turns into obsession or disappointment. The mind of the Zettelkasten turns into a ghost, something ethereal and evasive that can hide in plain sight. We dive into our Zettelkastens in search for what we believe we created and just seem to find notes.
So, what is the Zettelkasten? One possible answer might be: The ghost that is able to hide in plain sight and just can be seen from the corner of the eye.
What do you think about that reasoning?]]></summary>

I recently saw a post in which someone regurgitated the often-commented Philip Wadler quote, “Agda is what Haskell wants to be when it grows up.” I love Agda, and one of my favorite papers of all time is a proof of computational complexity using Agda (https://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/335444832/pt101f20thesis.pdf). But I’m sorry, Haskell is the grown-up version of Agda, and it is the rational adult in a room full of children when compared to every other programming language. Agda, Idris, etc. are programming ideals, and I would love to see them reach the level of maturity of Haskell. But, guess what? You can do literally everything in Haskell, right now, at an astronomical level compared to any other programming language. Serious…]]></summary>

 I'm thinking it might make the most sense to write the code on a local machine, and compile it on my local machine, and then upload a binary to the cloud. But perhaps there's another way to do this that I don't yet know.
 Ideally I'd like something where I can send HTTP requests to a given url/ip and have Servant handle them and send results back to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am a recent grad who has been professionally developing software in Haskell over the past two years. 
 I very much enjoy developing in the language and my job in general but I am somewhat worried about my future prospects not working in a more "mainstream" language.
 There aren't many jobs concerning pure statically typed FP languages in my area and I would strongly prefer not to work a fully remote job. I am tied to my current location for the forseeable future. 
 As a result of the above, I worry about a scenario where I would end up losing my job at some point down the road and not being able to carry my experience onto my next job as easily. Is this justified or would it not be difficult to make a switch if need be? I notice vacancies often require several years of experience in whatever programming language the company offering the job is using. My qualifications are solid for my age and I have had the opportunity to contribute to open source projects as well so I guess that might help me in such a scenario. Maybe I should look to contribute to some non-FP open source projects just in case?
 In short, the dilemma I am in is that I do not want to quit my FP job but at the same time I do not want to potentially end up in a bad spot career-wise.
 I figured it could help to have some perspective from other people about this matter and would love to hear your thoughts on it.

So why not re-use it to directly insert links to headings at point? I threw together this small gist which works well for this. Now I can invoke consult-org-heading, use orderless to winnow to the heading I want, C-, to embark, and l to insert the link. 
 What methods do you use for quick internal link insertion in org?

 There's no curl job running, in fact emacs has no child running (according to pstree). elfeed itself is still usable. The message survives a deletion of the elfeed buffers and is only cleared if I restart emacs. Which is a pain.
 Any ideas for me before I restart emacs again? (I've already scoured the bug reports at https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/issues)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been taking rock the jvm’s advanced scala course on Udemy, and I feel like there just isn’t enough legitimate practice for the concepts to fully sink in. Basically, I recognize the patterns when they come up in production code that others write, but I have a hard time actually using the patterns myself. Work projects that require me to use them are once in a blue moon type situations, so I need a way where I can hone my scala skills and understanding outside of the day-to-day projects that come up.
 I’m wondering if anyone has advice on how I might craft my own mini practice projects that would help me really get a feel for when to use type classes, implicits, futures, and whatnot. 
 I guess more broadly, my question is: how do I come up with projects to hone my skills without prompting from courses or from product folks at work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I have recently uploaded my first cabal package to Hackage, the text-compression library: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-compression
 This library aims to provide a simple interface to various efficiently implemented compression algorithms.
 Currently, this library only has implementations for the Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Inverse BWT algorithms.
 A brief list of future algorithms to be implemented and supported:
  
FM-index
 Move-to-front (MTF) transform
 Run-length encoding (RLE)
  
And more!
 A test suite is to be implemented for the current and future implementations.
 ​
 I would appreciate any and all feedback, and thank you for taking the time to check out this post and the library!
 ​
 Matt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd describe myself as a relatively senior Haskell-dev. Recently however, I had the opportunity to ask a much more experienced (20y+) Haskell-guru to review my code. He sighed, smiled and and said my code reminded him of his early Haskell days. I asked "how come?", to which he replied
  
I also used to write r instead of request -- you're a programmer, not a mathematician. You're doing Haskell, people already know you're clever -- you don't have to write it on their noses (Swedish proverb)
  
I don't think I'm alone in doing things this way. If I were to justify it, I'd say past-me was carried away by Haskell's promise of extremely concise code, and using 1-3 character variable names lend themselves to that end. Am I (are we?) just being vain at the expense of future maintainability? Have any of you found yourself adopting more descriptive variable names (as is custom in most other languages) with more experience?

I wanted to enable the mouse, so I turned on Xterm Mouse Mode, but once I did that, scrolling seemed to be completely turned off. Whenever I try to scroll, it just says mouse 4/5 are undefined.
 I tried to find a solution online, but the solutions I came across seemed very hack-y. It feels like this kind of thing is just a setting I missed, especially because scrolling was working perfectly fine before. If there is no "direct" solution, I am curious why this is the case. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand the behavior of the variable current-prefix-arg. In particular, I'm trying to understand whether if I pass a prefix argument to func, and other-func is called by func, other-func should be ignoring that prefix argument. 
 Consider the following four functions: 
 (defun f1 (arg) (interactive "P") (when arg "Non-nil")) (defun f2 (arg) (interactive "P") (when current-prefix-arg "Non-nil")) (defun g1 (arg) (interactive "P") (message "%s, %s" current-prefix-arg (f1 nil))) (defun g2 (arg) (interactive "P") (message "%s, %s" current-prefix-arg (f2 nil))) 
 I would have thought that both g1 and g2 would behave the same. But if I call g1 with the C-u prefix key, I get "(4), nil", whereas if I call g2 with the C-u prefix key, I get "(4), non-nil". 
 Is this as it should be? I understand I can bind current-prefix-arg to nil before calling f2, i.e. I could just call f2 inside the scope of a let expression, binding current-prefix-arg to nil. But is there a cleaner way to do this? 
 Looking at the manual section on prefix command arguments hasn't helped me figure this out, so I'm hoping someone here may be able to help. (I'm not clear on what is meant there by "the next editing command. At first I thought prefix-arg would be passed on to functions in the scope of another, but current-prefix-arg would not; now I'm not sure anymore.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying write a function where depending on what the arguments are, it does different things with out an insane amount of pattern matching. For example, the function eval has 4 arguments. "eval if t 1 2" should return "1" and "eval if f 1 2" should return "2". If the 2nd argument is t i want to return the 3rd argument and if f then the 4th. I need to do this on a bigger scale, but this is a simple example I can think of. Can someone help me out on how to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I wrote two functions for the Haskell functor laws and I am now required to do the following:
 Show that Either String (Maybe Integer) follows the functor laws. You will need several test cases that `shouldBe` True. These cases should test when the Right value is Nothing or Just k, where k is some Integer. Your test cases should also test when Either is a Left value. 
 Will someone please help me understand how to use "either" to test the functor laws? The two functor laws that I wrote are shown below:
 firstFunctorLaw :: (Eq (f a), Functor f) => f a -> Bool
 firstFunctorLaw x = (fmap id x) == x 
 secondFunctorLaw :: (Eq (f c), Functor f) => (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> f a -> Bool
 secondFunctorLaw g f x = (fmap (g.f) x) == (fmap (g . f) $ x)

If you use the same computer in different contexts, let’s say for work

operating systems to protect your private life data from mistakes or
hacks from your work. For instance a cryptolocker you got from a
compromised work email won’t lock out your family photos.
But then you have two different operating systems to manage, and you
may consider that it’s not worth the effort and simply use the same
operating system for your private life and for work, at the cost of
the security you desired.
I offer you a third alternative, a single NixOS managing two securely

 After a period of spooky deliberation and well-received release candidate, Koz and I are pleased to announce mtl-2.3.1, which features the following hellish changelog:
  
Add modifyError to Control.Monad.Error.Class, and re-export from Control.Monad.Except.
 Make the MonadCont instance for ContT more polykinded; now, r is allowed to be of an arbitrary kind k, rather than only Type.
 Add a generic liftCallCC for use with any MonadTrans.
 Add modifyError to Control.Monad.Error.Class
 Return re-export of ExceptT and related functions to Control.Monad.Except.
 Add label function to MonadCont
  
If you wish to migrate to mtl-2.3.x and have not yet done so, please refer the migration guide in the repo: https://github.com/haskell/mtl/blob/master/docs/Mtl-2.3.x-Migration.md
 A release has been published on the github repository under the tag v2.3.1.
 Happy Halloween!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm trying eglot on emacs-29 which I configure like follows (mostly for C++): ```
 (progn (customize-set-variable 'eglot-autoshutdown t) (customize-set-variable 'eglot-extend-to-xref t) (customize-set-variable 'eglot-ignored-server-capabilities (quote (:documentFormattingProvider :documentRangeFormattingProvider)))
 (with-eval-after-load 'eglot (setq completion-category-defaults nil) (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(c-mode c++-mode . ("clangd" "-j=4" "--malloc-trim" "--log=error" "--background-index" "--clang-tidy" "--cross-file-rename" "--completion-style=detailed" "--pch-storage=memory" "--header-insertion=never" "--header-insertion-decorators=0")))) (add-hook 'c-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure) (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure) (add-hook 'rustic-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)) 
 ```
 Things seem to work, however, even when I have requested clangd to not do header insertion --header-insertion=never, eglot keeps inserting headers for me. How can I disable this behaviour or I'm I doing something wrong?
 For example, if I'm on a C++ buffer and I type std::vector then eglot will go ahead and add #include <vector> which I don't want at all.

 On behalf of the EmacsConf 2022 organizers team, I’m very excited to announce the schedule for EmacsConf 2022 (Dec 3 and 4).
 All of the times listed on the schedule are in EST (UTC-5). You can click on each talk’s title to open its page for more information, including its scheduled time in your local time. (Displaying local time requires running a tiny bit of AGPLv3+-licensed free/libre JavaScript code, included on the talk pages.)
 For prerecorded talks, this time is also when the talk’s video will be made available on the same page. Please note that the times are approximations, and that the schedule may change leading up to the conference.
 As the conference approaches, we’ll post more details on how to watch and participate.
 You can subscribe to the emacsconf-discuss mailing list at https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacsconf-discuss to be sure you’ll get updates. We’ll also put updates here on r/emacs.
 Want to help make EmacsConf even awesomer? Volunteer!

 The prospective opportunity of contributing cabal packages to Hackage excites me and was wondering if anyone knew of how to be added to the Uploaders group there? I have sent an email but maybe the admins haven't seen/checked emails for new users to be added to the uploaders group?
 Does anyone know if there are any other requirements to be given access to upload packages to Hackage?

 Thank you in advance!

 One solution would be SortedMap, but I read some benchmarking blog posts that they tend to be slow.
 Other would be implementing a binary heap using a Vector, which is supposed to be faster, but I’m not sure if it will still be faster if I need to perform the sifting on it.
 Is one of these options viable or is it just one of the situations, where using a mutable data structure is the best option?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been using Gnu Emacs in the office for about two weeks now. I'm a vim user and will remain a vim user but I was challenged to try emacs by my colleagues and I in turn challenged them to try Vim. After the promised two weeks I can say the following about emacs from a vimmer perspective.
 I actually LIKE IT. I like the possibilities of emacs and the extensibility although for my workflow it doesn't offer much that vim plugins don't.
  
I don't like emacs PACKAGE MANAGER at all and I don't really care for lisps. I find vim script much easier. I don't like how emacs treats buffers and I find myself constantly killing extra buffers. I don't mind the emacs key bindings that much but I quickly changed the evil mode because muscle memory was killing me. 
  
I both LOVE & HATE M-x commands! I love them cause you can discover so much about was emacs can do but I hate typing them. I REALLY like w3m in emacs! I use w3m in a terminal on a daily basis and with emacs I can just have it open in a buffer or split and do my work at the same time. 
  
I LOVE how great emacs handles RTL languages. It is just great and looks great too.
  
I don't care for org mode! Yea yea I know you will hate me for saying it but I really dont care about it I prefer Vim wiki
  
I DON'T like the emacs terminal options that I've tested so far. K couldn't install vterm so maybe thats why
  
With all that being said I will use both emacs and vim on a daily basis for different things but what would make my life easier in emacs would be if I knew a way to handle buffers more effortlessly in emacs. In vim I can ZZ out of any buffer or split. The emacs evil mode doesn't provide that by default and I couldn't map it myself in the config.
  
PS: I use the latest release of emacs in the Arch repos. I am a frontend web developer.
  
PS2: sorry about the lengthy post, just thought I'd share my experience. Cheers.

A I thought it would be nice if there was a common knowledge base on what Luhmann himself wrote on Zettelkasten. So here is a translation of all 18 notes of the section 9/8 of his second Zettelkasten. I tried to find a middle ground between a translation that is faithful to his style, the nature of the German language, and the least ambigious English I can come up with.

 • Couldn't match expected type ‘(a0 -> a0 -> a0)
 -> Vec -> Vec -> Vec -> Vec’
 with actual type ‘Vec’
 • The function ‘Vec’ is applied to three arguments,
 but its type ‘[Double] -> Vec’ has only one
 In the expression: (Vec x) (<>) (Vec y)
 In an equation for ‘mappend’: mappend = (Vec x) (<>) (Vec y)

 Question 2: In the following function I am trying to return a list of booleans depending on the values of the 2 input vectors. If the first 2 numbers match, it should be True, and so on. The functions compile but I am unable to test them.
 andd :: Vec -> Vec -> [Bool]
 andd (Vec x) (Vec y) = zipWith equals x y
 equals :: Double ->Double -> Bool
 equals x y = x==y

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While surfing around on Emacs Stack Exchange, someone commented to go look at dir-locals-set-directory-class. It has a closely associated function called dir-locals-set-class-variables.
 Base Emacs knows about projects. Projects are defined (mostly) via version control. I know about Projectile and use it as well but this is in base Emacs introduced in version 23.
 The two steps are to first set up dir local variables based upon class using dir-locals-set-class-variables. I explain why I used eval later but I did this:
 lisp (dir-locals-set-class-variables 'proj1 '((nil . ((eval . (pedz/proj1-set-default-mode-locals)))) (enh-ruby-mode . ((eval . (pedz/proj1-set-enh-ruby-mode-locals)))))) 
 The second step is to tie a project (specified by its directory) to a class like this:
 lisp (dir-locals-set-directory-class "~/Source/proj1" 'proj1) 
 And you are done. The two functions pedz/proj1-set-default-mode-locals and pedz/proj1-set-enh-ruby-mode-locals will be called based upon the mode of the file being visited within the project. And they are also called for such things as compile buffers and other buffers not visiting files within the project based upon default-directory. Those functions can set variables, enable modes, etc.
 So... you are asking Why not just use .dir-locals.el?
 The answer is because of risky variables. I now have three variables that end with program which are (properly) considered risky that need to be set in this project and it isn't possible to type ! and tell Emacs "Yes... those variables for this directory are ok. Please don't pull on my shirt tail again about this.". Rather, each new file that is opened, it will ask if those variables are ok to be set.
 And I totally get why. It is unsafe to just set those variables based upon something that may or may not be under your control. But your init files are (or should be) under your control. So, I've moved all of the project specific settings into my init files.

 (defvar my-table (make-hash-table)) (puthash 'foo '(nil nil 0) my-table) (puthash 'bar '(nil nil 0) my-table) (puthash 'baz '(nil nil 0) my-table) (defun do-stuff () (let ((running (nth 0 (gethash key my-table))) (chain-state (nth 1 (gethash key my-table))) (last-idle-value (nth 2 (gethash key my-table)))) (setf running t))) (do-stuff 'bar) 
 then I would hope that (gethash 'bar my-table) shows me the row (t nil 0) but it's still (nil nil 0).
 This matters because now the only thing that will work is if I don't let-bind. And that makes my large functions super-unreadable with (nth 1 (gethash key my-table)) all over the place. 
 I've also tried cl-letf and seq-let, they don't help here.

 Because it works as I intend when I set fixed-pitch directly to use PragmataPro Liga instead of inheriting that propoerty from default I conclude that I'm doing something wrong when I set fixed-pitch to inherit from default.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR - how to make sure my server written in IO doesnt die when load spikes. Also how to not have latency spikes but instead return errors when server limits are reached 
 So in his talk The Case For Effect Systems Spiewak says something(its timestamped) like "I had a service that could handle 100 connection and then when it got a 1000 it didnt crash because it was written with IO and Resource" and doest really elaborate on why that was the case 
 From my point of view its very easy to have such guaranties in "1 thread per request" model since all you have to say is "this thread pool of size 100 will handle http connections" and 101th concurrent connection will fail cause you dont have a thread to for it. When with effect systems and asynchronous stuff in general(eg NodeJs which only has 1 thread) where you have n threads to handle a much bigger m of concurrent connection you dont have that. And generally its a good thing cause what you do is essentially keep a queue of things to do trading memory and latency for the ability to handle any number of connection up to the limits of you your systems resources. You latency rises but you dont return 500s. Up to the point where you die.
 And I dont see how IO and Resource would help you with now dying when IO(and to be fair Futures) is the thing that enables such a problem

 I have been playing with keymaps and wrapper commands a lot. And something I have come to realise is that a lot of stuff could be implemented really fast by sending arbitrary key sequences. 
 Keyboard macros seem limited to me : they look more like a succession of commands than a succession of keys.
 Two examples I could not achieve with macros (maybe I'm doing it wrong)
 - Prepare a command : for example I want to prepare a call to isearch, with foo pre-typed into the minibuffer. When I do it the macro way, the macro will execute the command isearch foo
 - Define an alias for partial key-bindings : let's say I want to alias C-x r to C-r, so that i can type C-r t instead of C-x r t (which is bound to #'string-rectangle). I could not make a keyboard macro work since C-x r is not bound to anything
 Is there anyway to send arbitrary key sequences to the emacs interpreter from elisp ?
 ​
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the docs, it seems that when building emacs, one obtains an executable called temacs which then loads the elisp libraries that give us a functioning editor. I imagine this temacs binary is just an elisp interpreter. Is there a way to interact with temacs like one does with the sbcl repl and manually load the elisp libraries to see how emacs bootstraps in real time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, guys! I have the technical question.
 Need to merge the payload if the reference number(refNo) is the same in different messages. Limitation is that I can only use a KTable and if the key is an even number I don't need to merge the payload. Additionally, the order of incoming messages should not change the result.
 ​
 For example, if we have an empty topic and incoming messages are:
 ​
 1: { key: "1", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1}} }
 2: { key: "2", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }
 3: { key: "3", value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} } // this one should be not effected and left how it is
 ​
 Expected result:
 ​
 1: { key: "1", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1, data2}} }
 2: { key: "2", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }
 3: { key: "3", value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} }
 ​
 The only way I can think of to do this is to use two times .groupBy and join with the original topic everything again.
 ​
  
First change the key to refNo, save the key to the value itself, and join the payload during aggregation.
 Secondly .groupBy revert key to the initial state.
 The last step joins everything to the original topic because I lost one message during grouping by.
  
​
 I'm pretty sure there's an easier way to do this. What is the most optimized and elegant way to solve this issue?
 ​
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, I am not the author of this tool, but have used toc-mode to make tables of contents for pdf and djvu files for many times. There are only a few other tools have the same functionality, but toc-mode is supposed to be the most convenient one. 
 Most other tools are command line, which is not adequate for this task. Even though a pdf contains the information of its table of contents, it is almost impossible to get a perfect table of contents automatically. You always need to do some editing to the extracted table, and this is why having this tool in Emacs is reasonable. Most editors focus on programming code, but things involving editing are more than that. I think toc-mode is a good example.
 By the way, the same author has more ambitious goals to create better a better doc viewer with some editing functionalities in Emacs. This is again a great example how Emacs do can more than code editing.

I take a lot of notes that involve figures and equations. Due to my dislike for latex, I type all of my notes using markdown in vim. While markdown is fine for simple readmes, it's a bit lacking when it comes to organizing figures or making anything but basic tables. I would like to know whether orgmode has the ability to group figures. There are two kinds of these. The first is the type where you have multiple independent figures along a row, with each having its own caption. The second is like the first but in addition to each figure having its own caption, there's a caption for the whole group. Can emacs do that without resorting to using ugly latex code ?

 In case you haven't tried compilation-shell-minor-mode inside an inferior shell, please give it a try. You won't regret it. It also works with vterm, but you need to do a little extra work to make sure the key bindings don't conflict with each other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have the following code example to encode numerals as Church numerals, this compiles (with RankNTypes enabled) :
 s :: (a -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c s x y z = x z (y z) k :: a -> b -> a k x _ = x type ChurchNumeral = forall a. (a -> a) -> a -> a csucc :: ChurchNumeral -> ChurchNumeral csucc n = s (s (k s) k) n 
 However, once I η-reduce csucc to
 csucc = s (s (k s) k) 
 I get
 • Couldn't match type: (b0 -> c0) -> a0 -> b0 with: forall a. (a -> a) -> a -> a Expected: ChurchNumeral -> ChurchNumeral Actual: ((b0 -> c0) -> a0 -> b0) -> (b0 -> c0) -> a0 -> c0 • In the expression: s (s (k s) k) In an equation for ‘csucc’: csucc = s (s (k s) k) | 130 | csucc = s (s (k s) k) | 
 How could I get this version to compile? I'm guessing passing in the argument explicitly allows GHC to know that the second argument of the most-outer s call has the expected type, but leaving that s partially applied, GHC is looking for the type in the signature of s and it can't unify that type with ChurchNumeral. Is that correct?
 Thank you in advance!

You can make looping patterns greedy using the pattern.greedy() method, but you cannot yet make group patterns greedy.
  
And in the examples they have the following comment for greedy:
 // expecting 2, 3 or 4 occurrences and repeating as many as possible start.times(2, 4).greedy()
 What do they mean by repeating as many as possible in this context?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[-XScopedTypeVariables is super useful but traditionally only allowed binding type variables in function definitions with explicit types. Recently-ish we got explicit type variables in pattern positions
 lookupQMap :: forall a. Typeable a => QKey a -> QMap -> Maybe a lookupQMap qid qmap = -- This could use a Data.Typeable.cast, but it's simplified from some more complex code case lookupQ qid qmap of ResultEntry @r' dat _ | Just Refl <- eqT @r @r' -> ... 
 Which is great and makes GADTs much more usable in my experience. But there is some churn when adding new arguments, which I usually work around by using record syntax
  case lookupQ qid qmap of ResultEntry @r {resultData=dat} -- [parser] [E] parser error on input '{' 
 The proposal and paper don't seem to mention record patterns. Is this an oversight, or an intentional decision because it would make the grammar ambiguous, or something else? Does anyone know a workaround?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have some exercise information recorded in a table in one of my org files and I was trying to plot the table in a graph and have the graph pop up beneath the table. 
 Here is the type of data that I am trying to plot:

 I am running emacs on WSL2 on a windows computer and I installed gnuplot from the ubuntu terminal first. Then I also included the following in my init.el file: use-package gnuplot :straight t. I then placed my cursor near the table and ran M-x org-plot/gnuplot as mentioned in the manual. I did not get any errors but I am not sure where the graph was created? How can I make the graph pop up in the org file?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of you Zettelkasten fans might be interested in an outdated and idiosyncratic program called Literary Machine. You can learn more here:
http://sommestad.com/lm.htm
The program is powerful but far from intuitive, so here are my personal notes about how to use it:
The core items in LM are:
Concept/category words (in the Dictionary pane).
Text items (notes; little boxes in which you write text).
Projects (collections of selected text items).
In a regular outliner program, you add items to a category (in a tree view or hierarchical list); in LM, it's just the opposite: you add categories to an item (similar to tagging with #hashtags. This is true for LM projects, too. You don't add items to a project; you add projects to an item. All of this is done by dragging a concept (dictionary word)…]]></summary>

 Whenever I try running my program with "Load GHCI" I get this kind of message: 
 <no location info>: error: can't find file: Lib.hs Failed, no modules loaded. 
 And when I try executing the default "someFunc" function (which basically prints a string) I get: 
 <interactive>:1:1: error: Variable not in scope: someFunc 
 What's wrong? How can I fix that? Or maybe I should just start from 0? Or even use a different IDE? What do you guys recommend?
 I'm very much fascinated with Haskell, category theory and functional programming, but how can I get into it when I'm unable to execute a simple Haskell program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a way to bypass org-agenda dispatcher (unsure about the terminology here: I'm talking about the buffer you get immediately upon calling org-agenda), and thought of a simple way of doing it. 
 (defun my/org-agenda () (interactive) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list 'my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((view (cdr (assoc (completing-read "Select an agenda view: " my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view nil))) 
 That worked just fine, but I thought it'd be nice to be able to pass restrictions (to buffer, subtree, etc.) to the function, perhaps using C-u as a prefix for a buffer restriction and C-u C-u for a subtree restriction. So I figured this should work: 
 (defun my/org-agenda-restr (&optional arg) (interactive "P") (when arg (org-check-for-org-mode)) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list 'my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg '(4)) 'buffer) ((equal arg '(16)) 'subtree))) (view (cdr (assoc (completing-read "Select an agenda view: " my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view restr))) 
 But it doesn't. For some reason, no matter which custom view I try to call, I get a CRM prompt asking me to choose a keyword. 
 Now, I thought maybe I was passing the wrong type of object as the third argument for org-agenda, So I tested using this, and it looks like what I'm passing as the third argument is a symbol, which I thought is what it wanted: 
 (defun my/test (&optional arg) (interactive "P") (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg '(4)) 'buffer) ((equal arg '(16)) 'subtree)))) (when (symbolp restr) (message "Yes")))) 
 So I'm going wrong somewhere, but cannot figure out where.

Why does this problem only come with chemacs2? I am using straight as the package manager. 
 Has anyone else also similar problems with chemacs2?

 I tried to bind C-= to er/expand-region from the expand-region package but nothing happens when I press C-=. 
 If I try C-h k C-= it's as if I hadn't pressed any key at all. The minibuffer prompts me to press some keys as if I hadn't pressed anything. 
 For example a bare text-mode buffer C-h k C-= C-p previous-line.
 Further, if i try binding C-S-= the same situation - it's ignored. Yet binding C-+ works so when I press C-S-= what is bound to C-+ executes.
 As far as I can tell my OS (linux) window manager (xfce4 xf4wm) doesn't bind C-= to anything special.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I am working on a Haskell project using cabal. It is a simple executable cabal project with a Main.hs file which imports a few other .hs files.
 Whenever I build it using cabal new-run, the imported source files seem to only get recompiled if something that depends on them changes in Main.hs. This is the case regardless of whether they have been edited since the last compilation.
 How can I change this behavior? Am I doing something wrong? Surely I should be able to edit the imported files and have the changes be reflected upon compiling the project?
 My workaround as of now is to systematically delete, before each compilation, all the files generated by cabal during the last one, which I am sure is not the intended way.
 Sorry if my question is dumb; as might be apparent I don't know much about the compilation process but I'd be happy to know more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kinda clickbait title, but I'll go with it. I'm someone who's familiar with both functional and oo paradigm and have experience working on industrial/research project with both. Although I work with different languages and paradigms for work and study purposes, I personally prefer Haskell over other languages I work with.
 Recently, I decided to learn a new language (for fun, for job hunt etc) and am thinking of Scala. Since I love Haskell, I wanted to start with Functional Programming in Scala. However, seems like the book doesn’t cover Scala 3. Should I worry about it and use some other resource? Or should I just go with Scala 2.x?
 Also, since I haven’t started learning, I'd appreciate if you let me know if I should learn it or something else (maybe "Go for elixir since you like strictly functional stuff")?
 Thanks!
 Edit: Thank you all for your valuable comments. I made up my mind to give Scala a try. Probably I will start with 2.x and move to 3 after getting some head around it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm making a compiler for a Computer Science class for a fairly simple language based on pascal (Pascal-0).
 In this language, we have a few reserved keywords, the thing is, they are case-insensitive (as are the variables). That means that for example, function, FUNCTION and funCTiOn all mean the same thing.
 As these are reserved keywords, I can easily "hard-code" them into the Lexer with something like this:
 function { \_ -> FUNCTION } 
 But this obviously is not case insensitive.
 I found a possible way to do it with maps, but I really would prefer to do it via regex if possible.
 Obviously, I can also do something like:
  (f|F)(u|U) ... (o|O)(n|N) 
 but that's obviously out of the question as it is not scalable.
 Is this at all possible, and is there a better way to do it other than maps, if regex isn't possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to have a completing-read type command that can perform commonly used file moving/copying operations. For example, I'm constantly syncing a couple of projects to a remote machine where they run. Currently I bind a key for each one to an rsync shell command call like so:
 (defun myprojectA-sync () (interactive) (shell-command (concat "rsync -a --progress --exclude-from='~/myprojectA/.syncignore' ~/myprojectA/ remotemachine1:~/myprojectA/ && echo 'Done.'")))) (map! :leader :desc "Sync my project A from local machine" "c b" #'myprojectA-sync) 
 It'd be helpful to have one single command to call a completion list that can run the pre-defined file operations for Project A, B, C, etc. I don't see why they couldn't act on multiple machines (remotemachine1, remotemachine2, etc.) or use different commands (mv, scp, rsync, etc.).
 Is there some feature/package that already exists to do something like this? 
 If not, does anyone have suggestions for a novice in elisp when it comes to writing the function? My thoughts so far were just a bunch of lists like
 (setq sync-names '("Sync project A" "Sync project B")) (setq sync-method '("rsync" "scp")) (setq sync-dest-dir '("remotemachine1:~/dir1" "remotemachine2:~/otherdir")) 
 to call shell-command wrapped in competing-read.

I'm building Emacs from source on Mac OS, 12.4 w/ M1.
 
I'm configuring Emacs with native compilation.
 
  ./configure --with-native-compilation \ --with-ns \ --disable-silent-rules 
  
The build succeeds, src/emacs runs like a charm and I make install.
 
My nextstep/Emacs.app runs, but emits a ton of libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver errors to the Messages buffer.
 
 I suspect the Emacs.app package has some misconfigured paths that are unable to find my libgccjit library, which I've installed via homebrew. I've tried experimenting with exec-path-from-shell to ensure Emacs is aware of my shell paths, but to no avail.
 In the meantime, I've been able to use emacs and emacsclient from the CLI with no issues to speak of. The only problems arise when I interact with the Emacs.app application. Anyone have an idea as to what's going on here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using GADTs to model the domain of my programme, and quite enjoying the experience, but have found that it requires quite a lot of boilerplate.
 For example, I am building a series of "filter" functions which filter input datatypes:
  data MyType = TypeOne | TypeTwo data MyEntity (t :: MyType) where MyEntityOne :: String -> MyEntity 'TypeOne MyEntityTwo :: String -> String -> MyEntity 'TypeTwo 
 I can create input filters which I can nicely compose with a fish (>=>) operator:
  filterOnes :: forall a. MyEntity a -> Maybe (MyEntity 'TypeOne) filterOnes x@(MyEntityOne {}) = Just x filterOnes _ = Nothing 
 The thing is, I'm finding writing this sort of case a bit tedious, and it would be much nicer to have something like this:
  filterOnes = filterFor @'TypeOne -- or, even better myFilter :: forall a. MyEntity a -> Maybe (MyEntity 'TypeOne) myFilter = (filterFor @'TypeOne) >=> someOtherFilter 
 But I don't know how to create something like this, which reminds me of the generic-lens library. I feel like this might be a common pattern with GADTs, is there an obvious solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've got some exciting news to share.
 Earlier this year, I've released the first version of HVM, a massively parallel functional runtime that aims to be the ultimate target for pure functional languages like Haskell, Elm, Kind and many others, and finally unleash the inherent parallelism of the functional paradigm. HVM's first version was very limited; it could only parallelize algorithms that recursed in a perfect binary tree fashion, it lacked IO and had some synchronization bugs. Soon, we'll be releasing an updated version, which fixes these bugs, includes IO primitives, and a new workstealing-based scheduler, which is capable of generalizing to basically any functional program that isn't inherently sequential. For example, it can use all cores on the computation of Fib(n), achieving maximal performance!
 The most exciting news, though, is that a GPU runtime is on the works. I've just, right now, finished the very initial prototype, a self-contained, 1200-LOC file that evaluates a busy recursive function on the GPU. It is performing about 680 million rewrites/second on 4096 cores of my Laptop RTX 3080. That's 4x more than single-thread performance, on the very first attempt of the very first prototype. I believe we'll soon be reaching record benchmarks on GPUs. Several API improvements and stability features will also be included on the upcoming update.
 We're ahead of very exiting times for functional programming, and I hope this encourages language developers to target the HVM! Imagine a working STG->HVM compiler? We're also interested in hiring a CUDA professional to help us profile and improve the GPU back-end. If you know someone who'd be interested, please let me know via DM! And be welcome to visit our Discord community and ask anything on the #HVM channel.

 This was an especially noticeable deficiency when trying selectrum with projectile-find-file - I couldn't open my dotfiles and type "init" to find "init.el", as it seemed to want me to specify the entire path preceding it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using emacs to write tex documents for a long time, and recently switched to spacemacs, with evil mode. I use the reftex command reftex-reference to insert \ref commands. In spacemacs evil mode, when I use this, the reference is inserted *before* the cursor (point), so that it's off by one character. I would like to know if it's possible to configure this to insert after. I'm asking here because I think this is a general evil-mode issue rather than a specific spacemacs configuration issue. Details below.
 Here's what happens:
 Have a tex file with some text like the following, with the cursor at the rectangle marker, and with the buffer in evil's "normal state" (like vim's normal mode), not insert mode.
 \begin{theorem}\label{mylabel} theorem text \end{theorem} Now some words▮ 
 Note that this is what happens when there's a space *after* "words" in the text; in evil's normal state, the cursor is a block that occupies the position of a character.
 Then I use the reftex-reference command and select "mylabel". The inserted text I get is
 Now some words\ref{mylabel}▮ 
 with the inserted \ref *before* the trailing space. Then the space appears *after*. I believe the line that actually does the inserting is line 510 of reftex-ref.el.
 ​
 To be clear, this is not because the final character is a space. If I delete the space after "words", positioning my cursor on the final "s", then the inserted reference looks like
 Now some word\ref{mylabel}s 
 with the cursor positioned on the final "s".
 ​
 So, the problem seems to be that reftex-reference is doing the insertion on the *left* side of the "normal state" cursor, not the right. I would like it to insert on the right. Does anyone here know how this can be configured?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I guess this is a rhetorical question because I doubt anyone knows why but it turns out that dired buffers return nil for buffer-file-name instead of the path to the directory they are viewing.
 I believe this has cost me a ton of time but I did learn a lot along the way. lsp-docker highest level function is lsp-docker-start. It calls lsp-workspace-root which calls buffer-file-name which, if starting from a dired buffer, returns nil so lsp-workspace-root returns nil and the LSP server is not started.
 This is my first venture into LSP mode and I was doing something slightly different, a basic low level function was returning nil, so I assumed I was way off track in my set up, and I needed to dig deeper. And, indeed, I came up with a solution. I was documenting what I had found for myself so I wouldn't forget and started asking myself more questions.
 I went back and tested lsp-workspace-root in a file that had LSP mode enabled and it returned the proper path for the workspace. I then restarted everything, loaded lsp-mode but didn't start it, and went to the directory of the project. Sure enough, lsp-workspace-root returned nil (as it had before). I then looked at the code and started to try and follow it step by step. That's when I discovered that dired buffers have no buffer-file-name. I opened TAGS (an arbitrary file within the project) and now lsp-workspace-root returns the proper workspace.
 I think I could have set up my LSP stuff with a simple YAML file had I tried lsp-docker-start from a file rather than a dired buffer and saved the time spent coming up with the solution I pointed to.
 Anyhow... live and learn I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To add to the list of Haskell wishes I posted yesterday: instance derivation for variable size tuples.
 That each tuple size has to be treated separately is really annoying. A lot of effort has been spent on much less important (= less common) problems, it certainly can be solved somehow with the syntax for variable type tuple size + extended tuple size... Actually maybe I'm just reinventing some existing wheel, but I've never seen it used.
 For example:
 class Encoding a where encode :: a -> String 
 Now I have to do:
 instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) = encode a <> encode b instance Encoding (a, b, c) where encode (a, b, c) = encode a <> encode b <> encode c -- and so on until the limit of either tuple size or patience is reached 
 You can see code like this across endless number of libraries, including base
 Why cannot I instead have something like this:
 instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) = encode a <> encode b instance Encoding (..., b) where encode (a@..., b) = encode a <> encode b 
 Never mind the specific syntax, it can be whatever, but the idea is to define instance for all tuple sizes recursively.
 Is it maybe possible already?
 That would also require (and allow) some size-polymorphic operations to add/split the first/last tuple elements, in a type safe way.
 I've no idea why it doesn't already exist.

 I am wondering whether someone has used org-mode as a basis for publishing documentation of Python projects via Sphinx. Actually, I am looking for a workflow to write my documentation in org-mode, convert it to .md or .rst, add Sphinx' autodoc-extension and finally publish the result with GitHub Pages. 
 Has somebody done something like that? Thanks...

 I am watching Rainer König's video on scheduling, deadlines and agenda view. I cannot use the agenda view. One of the comments says:
 Quick tips, the keybinding for agenda view has to be setted on the init file. Standard recommendation seems to be :

 C-c [

 I can't quite figure how to search across all the documentation for a specific word or regex if possible. 
 Example: I know that org-clock-report table (or clocktable) has :narrow param. I initially found it in google but now, since I know it exists, how can I quickly find info about this param directly in emacs? For example I want to find a manual page where this param is mentioned. Is there anything like apropos-EVERYTHING command that will look for a word (or regex) in all documentation? 
 Even more. I now know that info about :narrow param for clock table can be found in org manual on a page called The clock table. I know it from google. How could I find this page using emacs? 
 How would you find that page in emacs manual?
 P.S. I know about describe-* and apropos-* (and info) functions but I don't see any function that does the search across everything. There are also similar questions in the internet and there is a suggestion to search the documentation with grep or zgrep which I don't find useful. They just search in *.info files which when opened don't behave as info pages. Is greping the only way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen developers expensing a Sublime Text / JetBrains license to their employer, no questions asked. It would be amazing if one could similarly contribute financially towards emacs development efforts. 
 Would it be possible to cook up something formal enough (through FSF or some other org) like an annual "Emacs support license" with a couple of different tiers based on amounts (such that users can choose the split to different projects of interest). Users might then be able to expense it at work with the justification that it helps improve the specific packages they depend on (including core emacs). The same "licenses" could equally well serve as a portal for personal donations, but I feel that there's likely substantial low-hanging fruit in getting corporate funding in this grassroots manner.
 (I've pondered about this before, but some questions on the emacs survey reminded me of this again.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently switching my package management from Debian to Guix, and so far it's been wonderful. However, I just found something very curious. In the screenshot, you can see my 'old' self compiled Emacs (28.1) and my new Emacs (28.2) installed via Guix. They render the same text in the same file, in the same theme, with the same font (as per M-x describe-font), but they look quite different.
 Here's a screenshot showing the two side by side: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-a7bdddc0.png
 The version to the left is quite thin, the weight seems off. However, the weight is the same. Changing the weight will not remove this discrepancy. 
 Both Debian and Guix have the bold variant of Fira installed: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-36be0060.png
 Generally speaking, the bold variant works insofar that I can use it globally: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-5620acc4.png
 However, when used in a font-face, it won't become bold: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-bb7ddfd5.png
 I'm happy if anyone can point me to the necessary change to make the new install look the same as before. Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 Hi everyone, 
 ​
 I'm trying to write an elisp function that allows me to more easily query org-roam database with various keywords.
 ​
 Suppose I want to find all the titles that contain both "hello" and "world", I know this can be done with a single query instance like the following:
 ​
 (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from titles
 :where (and (like title "%hello%")
 (like title "%world%")) ] )
 ​
 Now I'm trying to turn this into an elisp function to make it easier to use. However, the challenge is my queries can contain an arbitrary number of keywords, for example:
 (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from titles
 :where (and (like title "%hello%")
 (like title "%world%") 
 (like title "%again%")) ] )
 ​
 The function should thus accept a list of keywords and return the notes that contains ALL the keywords in that list, something like:
 ​
 my-func('("hello" "world")) -> should return all notes containing "hello" "world"
 my-func('("hello" "world" "again")) -> should return all notes containing "hello" "world" "again"
 ​
 Can anyone suggest how to implement such a function?

 Since I started working with Haskell professionally at the beginning of the year (yay!), and neovim is my editor of choice, I've decided to put some elbow grease into improving my experience.
 And of course I would be happy to share it with (and get feedback/contributions/ideas from) any other Haskellers who use neovim!
 haskell-tools.nvim
  
Built around haskell-language-server, mostly.
 I just finished work on a feature that triggers a hoogle search for the type signature of whatever is under the cursor.
  
On a side note, my neotest-haskell adapter (TreeSitter-powered hspec tests) now supports both Cabal and Stack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone proficient in Haskell can give me some pointers on a homework assignment I'm currently bashing my head against. We're currently covering higher order functions, and our professor wants us to write a function that acts as a form of simple memory storage. Here's the part of the assignment that's stumping me:
 -- We'll consider a different way to represent memory. Memoryf is a function from variable names to values. type Memoryf = String -> Int -- The function memf1 gives all variables the value of zero memf1 = \_ -> 0 -- The following commands use the function putValue to modify our memory function: memf2 = putValuef "z" 3 memf1 memf3 = putValuef "y" (-2) memf2 memf4 = putValuef "x" 1 memf3 -- putValue should take three arguments: -- 1. The name of a variable, x -- 2. The variable value m -- 3. A Memoryf function -- putValue should assign x to m and return the updated Memoryf function putValue :: String -> Int -> Memoryf -> Memoryf putValue x m memf = _________________________ -- Write your code here -- Example output: -- (putValue "x" 5 memf4) "x" -- 5 
 My thinking is that calling putValue should add something to the effect of "if memf x is called, return m" but I have no idea how to write this. The furthest I've gotten is:
 putValue :: String -> Int -> Memoryf -> Memoryf putValue x m memf = (\x -> m) 
 which is useless because it will return the value of m for any variable, and thus doesn't work as a store of value.
 I'd greatly appreciate any guidance y'all have to offer. I'm giving myself a headache trying to sort through this myself.

 Is anyone able to compile on the latest MacOS?

 So far, I've been unable to link the libgccjit hello world: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html
 The farthest I can get is to the following errors:
 gcc-11: warning: could not understand version '13.00.00'
 ld: -rpath can only be used when targeting Mac OS X 10.5 or later
 collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
 At which point, it seems as if the problems are inherent to gcc-11 in combination with MacOS's ld. Anyone able to make this work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I was trying lsp-mode. After getting a bit annoyed with my laptop's fan always getting activated, I decided to try eglot. So far it feels much more lightweight.
 I'm having trouble getting it to do some things though.
 For context, I use pyvenv to manage my virtual environments:
 (use-package pyvenv:ensure t:config(pyvenv-mode 1)(pyvenv-activate "~/miniconda3/envs/myenv/"))
 I have done both conda install python-lsp-server[all] -c conda-forge and conda install pyright in this environment.
 If I use pyright-langserver, then a lot of imports are "unknown".
 If I use pylsp, then those imports seem to work, but I get some funny autocompletion behaviour. 
 import numpy as np
 np.lin
 This says "no completion found". But
 from numpy import linalg
 linalg.
 This works as expected, and I get reasonable suggestions for completions.
 ​
 Can someone tell me what's going on here and I to get this working? I was hoping things would work right out of the box, but...

 I recently switched to straight.el mostly for packages contributing purposes and it works really great. 
 In my init.el I sometimes use package-installed-p function to check if package is installed but straight.el doesn't install packages "emacs way" so that function always return nil. I expect there should be similar function in straight.el but I can't find one. 
 Do you know if it's exists? 
 Thanks
 EDIT: There is straight--installed-p but it expects a RECIPE and I don't really understand what is this. Definitely not a package name

 My usual workflow is that I'm working on a project (with .projectile in the root directory), and at some point I need to working on files outside of this project.
 I'll then C-x 5 2 to create a new frame and start opening files there. Then I switch buffers, and what I see are all my buffers.
 Is there a way in which I could group/filter buffers based on some default criteria? For example, if the buffer belongs to a project (with a .projectile file), filter those buffers into one group. 
 Or better yet, simply add filters so that I can stay organized.

 In the org-agenda I noticed that the state changes for these states are not listed with the corresponding time when org-agenda-log-mode is active.
 Here is an example to display what it looks like instead:
 Tuesday 25 October 2022 inbox: 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ State: (DONE) DONE Test1 TODO -> DONE inbox: State: ([X]) [X] Test2 [ ] -> [X] 
 The headline with Test2 is displayed without the time. Both headlines have a LOGBOOK drawer that does look the same.
 * DONE Test1 TODO -> DONE :LOGBOOK: - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2022-10-25 Tue 10:00] :END * [X] Test2 [ ] -> [X] :LOGBOOK: - State "[X]" from "[ ]" [2022-10-25 Tue 10:00] :END 
 Further it seems like all todo keywords that start with [ and end with ] are not displayed with the corresponding time but below the time-grid with State: in front like seen above.
 I believe I tracked down the function that generates the State: entries (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/9bfe00dda6b59d9b93eb7a825f6e0868afa1cca3/lisp/org/org-agenda.el#L5943) but I am not really able to understand the function and what is causing this behavior as I am fairly new to emacs/elisp
 Is there someway to show the tasks with the checkbox style todo keywords with time?
 Is this a bug or a feature that I can configure?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my internship at Tweag, I got the opportunity to work on Chainsail (see the announcement blog post), a web service that helps to sample from multimodal probability distributions.
A common approach to sampling well-behaved distributions involves Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods derived from the
basic Metropolis-Hastings algorithm; building a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its stationary distribution.
The major benefit of Metropolis-Hastings over more “direct” sampling methods is that it doesn’t require the target distribution to be normalized.
But it does have a big flaw:
if the distribution presents multiple modes separated by areas of low probability, the Markov chain tends to get stuck in one mode, and thus samples the distribution incorrectly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its initial release (corresponding thread) the library has got several improvements (the current version is 2.2.0.0), but the most significant development happened within the ecosystem. Here's the list of new adapter libraries:
  
crypto-rng-effectful - generation of cryptographically secure random bytes and numbers.
 
log-effectful - structured logging with multiple backends.
 
hpqtypes-effectful - access to a PostgreSQL database.
 
retry-effectful - combinators for monadic actions that may fail.
 
 It's worth noting that all of these are light wrappers over existing libraries, not rewrites. As advertised, effectful makes it easy to adapt libraries to be used as effects.
 Also, the Monocle project has moved to effectful.
 If anyone was skeptical about effectful, maybe that'll convince you to give it another look. I'm sure this is just the beginning :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to this: https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/10/20/language-rankings-6-22/
 ​
 What is surprising is that it is:
 - more adopted than Clojure that I thought to be the most popular functional language (even though I think it's really bad).
 - much more adopted than Erlang and F#, I thought Haskell is used less frequently than these.
 - has almost as many projects as Elixir in GitHub, but much more popular on Stack Overflow - shows the strength of the community.
 - as widely adopted as Perl.
 ​
 Looking at this chart I think we can get Haskell into the top 10 (or even 5) languages by solving several problems, as community (I do have a vested interest that it happens – our SimpleX Chat is written in Haskell):
 - make JSON a first class citizen in Haskell code, ideally with some syntax-level support, without requiring QQ, rather than one of the most complex to use libraries. It doesn't seem a coincidence that 2 most popular languages - JavaScript and Python - make it really easy to integrate with JSON.
 - make cross-platform compilation "manageable" (including mobile and web), not just "possible".
 - solve problem of compiled binary size - it should be at least 5x, better 10x smaller – even if it comes at cost of 10x longer compilation time (so that we would only use it for production builds).
 - at the same time, make interpreted tests execution simpler - I still can't figure out how to do it, waiting for several minutes until it builds with most cores idling is very time consuming... Maybe this is a solved problem, and there is a simple answer how to do it.
 - make networking and cryptography more trustworthy - with exodus of some maintainers into Rust-land they are at risk of abandonment – I will share more comments on this subject a bit later.
 ​
 These are all issues that Haskell Foundation and community can help solving, we could chip in some time/money too if there is some concerted effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for suggestions for how to manage repeated tasks with subtasks. Ideally, I'd like to be able to mark the parent heading as done and have all the DONE subtasks (or even better, those without a certain property) be changed to TODO. In practice, what I want is to be able to move from this: 
 * TODO Meal plan for the week SCHEDULED: <2022-10-24 +1w> ** DONE Make list of dishes ** DONE Make grocery list ** DONE Get groceries 
 to this: 
 * TODO Meal plan for the week SCHEDULED: <2022-10-31 +1w> ** TODO Make list of dishes ** TODO Make grocery list ** TODO Get groceries 
 after marking the heading task as done. 
 I suspect I could make use of org-todo-repeat-hook and define a function that will take all the sub-tasks of a given task and change them from e.g. DONE to TODO, or to the TODO state the parent will be in after repeat, e.g. 
 (defun my/org--bequeath-state () (let ((state (org-get-todo-state))) (org-map-entries (lambda () (org-todo state)) nil 'tree))) (add-to-list 'org-todo-repeat-hook 'my/org--bequeath-state) 
 But I'm wondering if anyone has given this more thought and has a better conceived solution they'd be willing to share.

The number of options is a bit overwhelming, but a lot of signs are pointing towards using lsp with pyright and lsp-ui. So that's what I've been doing, along with using pyvenv to choose my virtual environments. But I've noticed that I don't get any warnings if my lines are too long. I'm not sure why this is? Does it have to do with my settings, or is this not something lsp/pyright should catch?

As I’ve revisited my configuration today, I noticed that there are a few recent package managers (namely, leaf and elpaca) which are new to - at least - me and (at least elpaca) want to be straight.el’s “successor”.
 Is there any write-up about the state of GNU Emacs package management in 2022? Straight.el works for me (and I need its custom build features for two packages), but I don’t want to rely on deprecated packages for too long.

 I have searched in web, and found that Flycheck is using wrong dir, but i don't know how customize that. Is there some option to Flycheck work well on Django?
 pylint has an module named pylint-django. Can be this enhabled in Flycheck?
 Edit: I found solution that works to me for now, but isn't automatic.
 1) Install pylint-django pluging with pip pip install pylint-django
 2) Create a pylint config file in the root directory of project. You can do thi from terminal
 pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc
 3)Enhable Django pluging in pylint config file in "load-plugins" line
 load-plugins=pylint_django
 That worked to me. When you start flychek in current buffer, you can see if flycheck is using the config file:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From October 24th to November 30th, the 2022 edition of the Emacs User survey will be collecting responses!
 📋 https://emacssurvey.org/
 About the Survey
 This time there are no non-free Javascript or user-tracking caveats as this features a bespoke survey framework written from scratch for the Emacs User Survey to support a pure HTML-forms + CSS approach with server-side rendering 🎉.
 See the FAQ for more information on the survey itself.
 Promoting the survey
 It would be fantastic for this to be shared as far and wide as possible, to get responses from a large swathe of the community. If you can share this with the non-Reddit Emacs communities you are a part of, as well as any friends or colleagues that use Emacs that would be greatly appreciated 😊.
 So far the Survey has been shared on: - Reddit - Hacker News - Lobste.rs
 Addendum: all my responses are shown as missing?
 It has been noticed by several people that their results page shows some or all of their answers to be missing for questions they answered. In every case I've checked so far, all responses did get recorded in the database, but there seems to be a glitch that is occurring in some cases with the display/export of results.
 TLDR; Do not worry, your answers are safe.

 I am currently using Org mode to try and write a JET SOP/ write fantasy books or whatever. However, When trying to navigate through the text instead of going through each line, it jumps through each paragraph in chunks. 
 I know that this is due to "word wrap" and that technically it is all one giant line. But how does one change this behavior. I know a few days ago when I tested Visual Studio code I got the same issue. 
 (ignore my bad writing, this is super duper early) 
 TL:DR: how to change function of emacs to make it act more like a traditional word processor?

 Then I started using `next-buffer` and `previous-buffer` and developing an intuition for what buffer would show up.
 It's made my experience of using emacs drastically better in the same way that learning `ctrl+tab` and `ctrl+shift+tab` in web browsers made my browsing experience better. Maybe these kinds of feelings are very subjective, but I feel like this one might generalize to others experiences well.
 By default they are bound to `C-x <left>` and `C-x <right>`.
 Feel free to also share any similar other "wow this makes buffer management so much nicer feeling to use" experiences you've had.

 The :file link created by org-attach when org-attach-store-link-p is non-nil should be to the attachment, not to the original. In fact the link is to the original, not to the attachment. I believe this is a bug.
 DETAILS
 I've noticed some unexpected behavior in terms of the link that org-attach creates and places in org-stored-links when org-attach-store-link-p is non-nil. I'm seeing it when the method of attachment is move, copy, or symlink, either via org-attach-method, or when chosen directly when running C-c C-a. (I haven't tested any of the others.) The issue concerns the target of the created link.
 My expectation is that the target of such a link should point to the actual attachment itself. By that I mean, the target should be the path to the file or link in its place in th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm very new to org-mode although it already looks like something that I've been trying to invent myself (in much more lame ways) for many years.
 One thing that I don't immediately see from them the manual - is there some "standard" or well-know way to work with the outline-organized data that have multiple dimensions?
 Here is what I mean by that:
 Say, I have a lab diary where I track number of processes - each process every day:
 * Day 1 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team my notes on it ** Ongoing Experiment 1 checking out the night results, trying new approaches ** Something else ... * Day 2 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team ... ** Ongoing Experiment 1 ... ** Something else ... * Day 3 ... 
 And this is how it goes!
 So, the first dimension here is the timeline: Day 1, Day 2, ... while the second one is the processes that repeat every day.
 Clearly, depending on task, it would be handy to see this outline from the different points of view: sometimes considering the "time" dimension to be the outer one, sometimes to see the "process" dimension to be the outer:
 Time dimension is outer:
 * Day 1 ** Process 1 ** Process 2 ... * Day 2 ... 
 Process dimension is outer:
 * Process 1 ** Day 1 ** Day 2 ... * Process 2 ... 
 One can easily come up with a case of three or for dimensions like. E.g. "Date/[Home|Work]/Habit/Successes".
 Turning the tree inside out to follow the day by day progress for one of experiments would be very helpful. As well as tracking the daily successes in the second example.
 Is there a built-in feature or packages or a known workflow for such case?
 Like best practice(s) for such data organization, turning the outline inside out, making different OLAP-like views into the outline?
 thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tinkering with making simple interfaces with transient and tabulated-list-mode, things like a list of scripts with some information on them as columns, and key bindings/transients to edit, lint or execute them. While this is nice, for something more elaborate tabulated-list-mode is not enough. I am trying to get a view inspired by magit's status buffer, so I thought I could use magit-section for this. However, I couldn't find any guides on how to make something with it, and I am not savy enough to extract the exact usage from the magit code (I did try).
 So my question is, does anyone have any guides or any simple elisp code that I can use for reference to create a new derived mode out of magit-section?
 Edit: Fixed formatting.

 When I try to export an org file to pdf it always gives the error: Stopping because of bad filename. 
 Latexmk: Filename '~/notes/exports/20220825222250-beamer_presentation_example.tex' contains character not allowed for TeX file. Latexmk: Stopping because of bad filename(s). 
 I believe it is because the home directory is specified with a tilde character. 
 How can I fix this error?

 I download mail with mbsync, manage it with mu4e, and send it with SMTP. This all works fine and has for years.
 Except that I find that I suddenly have to deal with email hosted on office365. It does IMAP, so I can read my mail, but it warns
 `Notice: far side store does not support flag(s) 'P'; not propagating.`
 The consequence of this is that the changes I make locally aren't reflected on the server. Refiling or deleting mail doesn't have any effect. That means my INBOX is just going to grow and grow and grow and eventually that's going to be a problem. (Nevermind that if I decide to peek at my mail from my phone or something, it's going to be a confusing mess.)
 In a previous life, I managed with davmail, but dear $DEITY in heaven, I'd really rather not have to do that again.
 Anyone know if mbsync (or the office365 account) can be configured to make things Work Right(TM)?
