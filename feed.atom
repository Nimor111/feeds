Thanks to the Doom Emacs shipping, I knew of magit, projectile, LSPs and other utilities, but Emacs itself always came with wonderful "utilities" (e.g., M-x doctor, hanoi, calc, calendar, org ...) and just only to mention an example, I recently knew of M-x re-builder which I found awesome when doing M-x replace-regexp.
 In the end, I always feel like I'm not aware of a lot of functionalities in Emacs which are there, at my finger tips and thus the question, what are your favorite services/utilities/functions available in (Doom)Emacs?

However, my company is using kotlin and golang a lot and I want to understand the advantages of scala like type safe, correctness, compile-time error checking, etc. so that I can convince my company to use scala as well. Can you recommend any papers, blogs, videos, github repositories to learn these things? If there is a cost, I would be willing to pay.

In latest ellama release (already on MELPA) was added new command ellama-solve-reasoning-problem that implements Absctraction of Thought technique. It uses a chain of multiple messages to LLM and help it to provide much better answers on reasoning problems. Even small LLMs like phi3-mini provides much better results on reasoning tasks using AoT. I hope it can be useful. Also it can be reference implementation for your own chains.

 alias command 'export original=${alias | grep -h --color=never "^alias $1 " | head -n 1 | sed "s/alias $1 //"} && alias $1 && $1 ${cdr ${listify $*}}; alias $1 $original && unset original' 
 I have to set the grep color flags because I also have grep aliased.
 I just wanted to post this in case anybody else wants it, or if I'm stupid and there's a much better way to do this, or if it could be simplified/turned into elisp.
 Welcome to the Emacs shell ~ $ alias command 'export original=${alias | grep -h --color=never "^alias $1 " | head -n 1 | sed "s/alias $1 //"} && alias $1 && $1 ${cdr ${listify $*}}; alias $1 $original && unset original' ~ $ alias rm 'echo "no"' ~ $ rm test no ~ $ command rm test ~ $ cat test /usr/bin/cat: test: No such file or directory ~ $ rm whatever no

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love to use emacs in batch mode for text manipulation. I have done it so much I started to enjoy it and started code golfing with elisp. Its great but there are a lot of long function names like "with-temp-buffer" that could be assigned to a single character. Also it should automatically output the current buffer to stdout and argv arguments could be easier to retrieve.
 Sure common lisp would probably be better for most answers but my brain has been trained to do things in a emacs buffer and by god thats how its gonna be!
 Long story short, lots of tweaks could be made to make elisp code shorter albeit harder to read. I considered byte compiling the code but it was actually more bytes! Maybe the solution is to use keyboard hotkeys? Or maybe the solution is a custom golfing language interpreted by elisp
 Would appreciate any questions or suggestions on this topic.

 I created this package as part of the tooling I """need""" (wink wink) to create publishing tools to host a static website using Fastmail, which basically exposes files stored in your account.
 I started with a couple functions to upload files, but then I wanted to list files...and a few days later I was putting it all in an independent package, yak shaving be blessed. 
 I hope someone else finds it useful! There are a few things to improve, but from my testing the last few days it works well. Probably the most glaring omission is recursive uploads/downloads. And maybe caching.

 from an emacs instance running inside the same container, everything works fine. But if I run that same code from an emacs instance running on my host outside the container, I just get
 [jsonrpc] Server exited with status 256 
 I have no clue what this error code is, I cannot find it in the docs. I am not sure why this is happening, given that I exposed the port and the code works fine from within the container.

It is really handy for rust, since the compiler is so thorough, and it makes refactoring much less tedious. Ultimately, I probably use less than a quarter of the tools and features in emacs and many of the packages I have, so I suspect that there are dozens of game-changing tools right under my nose. What are some of your favorites, and how do you like to use them?

In this part of the course, we discuss Haskell code with side effects, such as terminal input and output, disk access, networking, random numbers, global state, and more. We motivate and introduce the IO type that is being used for side-effecting expressions. We learn how to compose IO actions, do notation, and how to combine the functional programming techniques we have been using so far with the world of IO.

 Haskell has evolved a lot since the '98 standard with lots of awesome features that many of us feel like we can't live without. At the same time it has, in my opinion, become cluttered and inconsistent partially due to incremental nature of these developments and the need for compatibility.
 This leaves me to ask:
 What what you do differently if you were redesigning a Haskell-like language from the ground up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After about 20 years of living in emacs, my left thumb has started to hurt badly, and it's because keyboards place the left Alt key so far to the left that I have to bend my thumb inwards to hit it.
 BTW, I used to hit CTRL by curling up my left pinky, but now I use mechanical keyboards which allow me to press it with the left side of my palm, so, no pinky stress anymore.
 Anyway, back to the Alt. I'm trying to rewire my brain to use ESC instead of the Alt. Or, in cases where I need it pressed continuously (e.g. M-b M-b M-b to keep going back a word), I try to use the right Alt key with my right thumb. (A key almost never used.) It's not easy, the muscle memory is strong, but I try.
 Do others here have the same problem? Any good suggestions?

 Right now running my/open-frame opens new frame as expected and shows my/transient at the bottom. Issues: 1) transient menu disappears the moment window loses focus. 2) if I exit this newly created window then going back to main instance of emacs will show this transient menu 3) transient menu not fullscreen. 
 This is how new created frame looks now https://i.imgur.com/lsVqIWx.png (shows currently opened buffer in my emacs and then shows my transient menu at the bottom)
 Ideal goal is something like doomemacs +org-capture/open-frame
 https://i.imgur.com/P76yrAd.png full height. Would love to be able to remove modeline too and show it afterwards doing refiling/capturing process. 
 Is there any packages or examples how I could achieve this?

 So I found it has a variable to enable recursing:
 (defcustom org-ql-search-directories-files-recursive nil "Recurse into subdirectories by default in `org-ql-search-directories-files'. This should probably be disabled by default, because e.g. `org-directory' may include deeply nested directories of non-Org files, such as a \".git\" directory, Org attachments directories, etc, which would make it slow to list the `org-directory' files recursively." :type 'boolean) 
 I use doom, so I set it in my `doom.d/config.el`
 (setq org-ql-search-directories-files-recursive t) 
 Restarted emacs and it still doesn't recurse into the dirs. Did I configure it wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for the confusing title, but I'm having trouble describing my problem.
 I find window behavior in emacs is very difficult to understand. There are many commands that either create a new window or replace the current buffer with a "temporary" buffer (eg help window). And some commands simply replace the buffer in current window, some replace the buffer in the other window, still others create a new split. And when something takes over an existing window, sometimes when quitting it returns the previous buffer, and other times it removes the window altogether.
 So far I have not been able to discern a method to this madness and I am often surprised by what happens. A lot of winner-undo.
 First question: is there any underlying logic here I'm not seeing? Or is it just a free for all?
 Second question: how do you handle this? Memorize/internalize how each command will behave? Rely heavily on winner mode? Something else? 
 I recently stumbled on popper.el so was thinking to give that a try. Curious what others are doing.

I have a Docker file that’s on my Linux box which takes a very long time to build; I wanted to keep my monitor and keyboard connected to my mac so I could work on other stuff, so I just SSH’d into the Linux box in iTerm and ran docker build. When the build broke, I could switch to an Emacs buffer that was editing the Dockerfile on the Linux box, make edits, then re-run docker build. Once it finally worked, I fired up magit and it Just Worked™ and ran all the Git commands over SSH. So nice!
 What delights you about Emacs?

 Different approaches I've seen, and their pros/cons:
 Put everything in one giant file:
  
pros: easier to keep the compiler happy (though order within the file still matters).
 cons: harder to navigate/reason about. May be daunting for other developers.
  
Divide into multiple files along sensible boundaries:
 Put common functionality in a main package.el file, and require it in all sub-files.
  
pros: clean division of concern.
 cons: supports one-way dependencies only: package.el cannot use capabilities of any of the sub-files without declaring them.

This is one of those cases where for efficiency’s sake, we actually want to use an honest-to-goodness mutable array.

 The README for compile-multi was enough to get this to work; the meat of the code is reading the composer.json from the project path, selecting the "scripts" key and listing all available commands.
 Since not everyone is rocking Emacs with native JSON support, I wrapped everything in (json-available-p). That level of indentation makes me sad a bit :)
 It works as is, but tips are welcome:
  
Is there a way to check for JSON availability when wrapping this as a package/auto-loadable .el file?
 Do you have any code review suggestions? Like better combining (message ...) nil in the un-happy path?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Integration testing, a crucial phase of the software development life cycle, plays a pivotal role in ensuring that individual components of a system work seamlessly when combined. Other than unit tests at an atomic level, every thing in the software development process is a kind of integration of pieces. This can be integration-in-the-small, like the integration of components, or it can be integration-in-the-large, such as the integration of services / APIs. While integration testing is essential, it is not without its challenges. In this blog post, we’ll explore the issues of speed, reliability, and maintenance that often plague integration testing processes.

I can connect to the repl just fine from emacs using sly, but when I try to compile a file, I get an error saying that the TRUENAME could not be found. I imagine this is because of confusion between pathnames on host vs guest. The manual says to use the following snipped
 (add-to-list 'sly-filename-translations (sly-create-filename-translator :machine-instance "remote" :remote-host "remote.example.com" :username "user")) 
 But I dont know how to fill in the options. Setting remote-host to localhost and user to root does not work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm running Emacs on windows with C# for my job. Everyone else on my team uses Visual Studio (obviously) and the files are encoded with `UTF-8-BOM` or `utf-8-with-signature-dos` in Emacs speak. Emacs somehow wasn't reading these files properly and kept saying the encoding is ISO-LATIN-1 and would just print the BOM characters literally on the screen. I had no clue about all this except that I saw 3 weird characters every time I opened any file. So yesterday I decided to dig deep and gather whatever I can to fix this. After trying a few approaches what worked is `(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8-with-signature-dos)`. The files are read properly now and the language server is also happy. I use Sharper to build and run my project and it started failing after this change. It uses `shell-command-to-string` and others to run `dotnet` commands in the project. The commands fail with
 'ï»¿dotnet' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
 The first 3 characters are BOM and windows command prompt cannot handle this encoding. Is there a way to fix this, either from Emacs side or from the windows command prompt side?
 EDIT: This is with GNU Emacs 29.1 on Windows 11.

 Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all
 I am using Eglot to connect to the typescript-language-server which is used for both ts and js. However, my project does not have TS, it's an older React project in plain JS.
 Now the problem is typescript-language-server will report type errors and throw the error on some JSX components that these cannot be used as JSX components which is really annoying. Is there any way to resolve this? In VSCode for example there is an option javascript.validate.enable": false to add to the editor config and it will not validate the JS files anymore, however, it will still provide code fix suggestions, like imports for example.
 If there is no way to do this, is there a way to at least somehow get the import fixes working or connect eglot to some eslint server if such exists instead of typescript-language-server?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: 
 The eglot code-actions do not work at all, I cannot fix imports anymore. Good thing is that I was able to get both eglot / eslint reports to show up in Flycheck, but code actions do not work and it still reports the type errors as well. Here's the current config that I have:

 when i create a card in anki, i want it to show up on a defined org file as an entry (so i could then use a refile command to choose where i want it to go). is it possible to do this with a python script? i've seen people online use python as an automation tool for anki, and i wonder if that can also be applied this? thanks

 I have an init.el and an early-init.el. I suspect it is the latter that is causing problems. The fonts are set in init.el.
 However, launching emacs this way results in a different font as compared to launching emacs with the daemon running. I'd really appreciate any help on this. Thanks!

 (use-package geiser :ensure t :config (setenv "DISPLAY" ":0") (setq geiser-active-implementations '(mit)) (add-hook 'geiser-repl-mode-hook 'hn-disable-trailing-whitespace-and-empty-lines)) (use-package geiser-mit :ensure t :config (setenv "MITSCHEME_HEAP_SIZE" "100000") (setenv "MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH" "/Users/harish/Applications/mit-scheme/lib/mit-scheme-svm1-64le-12.1") (setenv "MITSCHEME_BAND" "mechanics.com") (setq geiser-mit-binary "/Users/harish/Applications/mit-scheme/bin/mit-scheme")) (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((scheme . t))) (defun hn-org-confirm-babel-evaluate (lang body) (not (string= lang "scheme"))) (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate #'hn-org-confirm-babel-evaluate) (defun hn-disable-trailing-whitespace-and-empty-lines () "Disable showing trailing whitespace and indicating empty lines in the current buffer." (setq-local show-trailing-whitespace nil) (setq-local indicate-empty-lines nil)) 
 With this setup, I can start a Geiser REPL and it beautifully loads mit-scheme with Scmutils functions, including talking to X for graphics. But Org-Babel (whose docs claim that it relies on the Geiser REPL) seems to load vanilla mit-scheme and not Scmutils. I cannot get it to recognise D and other Scmutils functions when executing Scheme code blocks.
 What is the best way to ensure that the mechanics.com band file is properly loaded in Org-Babel sessions, just as it is in REPL? Any help to streamline this process would be greatly appreciated!

 Hi everyone!
 In case anyone is collecting the Topps stickers for the current Euro 2024 tournament, I have created a small program which keeps track of your duplicates and the ones you still need.
 Essentially, you add the stickers you've got in files/Got.txt and it generates a list with your duplicates (together with how many extra copies of each sticker you've got) and the ones you still need. See the readme file for more instructions.
 This should work as it is, although there is still some room for improvement. Most importantly, how to print proper umlauts instead of escape characters in the files and how not to surround strings with "". If anyone knows the solution to this please chime in! :)
 I hope this would be of help to someone. It certainly is it me as I couldn't find a similar app for this tournament.
 Happy swapping!

 I had an old clojure project and then created a new one with the same project name at the same root path. 
 IMO, because the path and the name are the same dired/find-file after switch-to-project lists the old and new project file and directory paths together.
 Should not the old project paths be removed, because it is not valid anymore?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I recently started using the NS version of emacs 30 (previously I was using emacs-mac). The experience was great for most of the time but sometimes I'd get terrible stuttering which I eventually diagnosed to fringe rendering.
 As it turns out, the NS redisplay draws fringes by converting the bitmap into a vector where each pixel is a square. Both the 'copy' and 'fill' methods of such an NSBezierPath are incredibly slow on my system (perhaps rasterising a path was cached at some point but now on ARM MacOS Sonoma it is not?), with 90% of the cpu time being spent inside -[NSBezierPath copyWithZone:].
 I've come up with a patch that changes fringes such that they're drawn using masked CGImages, which completely eliminates this slowdown when drawing fringes. But I'm no expert on NS so this might not be the best solution: https://gist.github.com/simmsb/7998452560b10a4de645a3d7d2adee32

 We are happy to announce that there is a new job opening for a Haskell developer at Chordify! We have had some success via this subreddit in the past, so the content of this post may ring a bell to some.
 Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net
 Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also make use of a custom Redis caching layer; you may know us from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/redis-schema
 We are looking for a new proactive, independent and creative functional programmer to improve the Chordify backend infrastructure, core technology, and launch new ideas to join our team of experienced developers in our offices in Utrecht or Groningen. You'd get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.
 More information (e.g. expectations, salary range, secondary benefits) and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [menno@chordify.net](mailto:menno@chordify.net) 
 We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.
 For transparency: this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We do allow working from home, but expect our colleagues to be in the office at least 50% of their time.

 I'm curious to know what the workflow of fellow emacsers is on this sub. Do you run just one frame of emacs (no emacsclient) and use that one frame to do your work, or do you run emacsclient to work on multiple frames?
 I find the one frame workflow to be more integrated into the idea of using emacs for most applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm relatively new to Haskell programming, so please don't be too harsh if this is a silly question.
 There's a particular behaviour I'm accustomed to in vscode with other languages that Haskell's extension doesn't seem to provide, and I'm curious if any solution is available.
 In most languages, when you type out a functions name and then type the opening bracket for the function call, you get a popup showing the function signature, as well as the name of each function parameter as you type.
 In Haskell, you only get the function signature popup when you're typing the name of the function itself, so you have to memorize the order of the function parameters, then go about actually typing them out. Sometimes, when there's an error over a function, you don't even get the popup when you hover over the function name, meaning you have to go elsewhere and type out the function name to check the order of its arguments.
 Some of this annoyance seems to be down to a fundamental incompatibility between Haskell and vscode; vscode expects a C-style language, where function calls are characterized by brackets, so can't understand function calls without brackets. It also obviously can't give parameter names, since parameters in Haskell can have multiple names because of pattern matching.
 Is there any solution to this issue, or is it just an annoyance you have to deal with?

Serokell has developed an online testing platform for administering practical and theoretical Haskell problems. Haskell is a complex language, offering a wide range of techniques and features for programmers. It’s simply not feasible for a novice or intermediate programmer to master them all. The goal of the Haskell certification is to help standardize what it means to ‘know Haskell’ at various levels of experience.
 As a community driven effort, we are soliciting self-nomination for volunteers to take part in the organization and decision-making around the certification process. These volunteers will help determine how the certification process evolves and which questions are relevant to the various experience levels of a Haskell programmer. Volunteers from organizations that use Haskell professionally are especially welcome.
 Please send your self-nomination to certification@haskell.foundation by the end of July 10th 2024.

 I don't think it should be in the TOP page of the official landing page for orgmode, pushing down the introduction, features, quickstart links and actual code examples. It's distracting and of interest to a smaller group than to justify the front facing real estate. It can be put in the "Update"s, "Worg", "Contribute" sections, pick your choice.

Due to a limitation in GTK 3, Emacs built with PGTK will simply exit when a display connection is closed. The problem is especially difficult to fix, such that Emacs on Wayland with multiple displays is unlikely ever to be able to survive disconnects.
  
And emacs daemon also doesn't run.
 These may be two separate issues - the emacs GUI disappearing and daemon not starting, but in regards to the first, on a laptop we can expect there to be network connections to continually connect/disconnect.

 When I take a pic from my iPhone, send it to my computer, and try to view it in Emacs, it just shows as blank, both in dired as well as an org inline image. I can take a screenshot of the image and use org-download to paste THAT image successfully, but specifically a photo taken from my phone just doesn't show up. (I've checked the "most compatible" setting on my phone, so it's making JPEGs and not .HEIC or whatever. I tried .HEIC and they also don't work.)
 Other .jpeg and .jpg files work, but specifically not ones from my iPhone. 
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm just considering a rewrite of a webapp-server from Express.js to HTTPurple. The server does the following things:
  
Manages user sessions and injects user auth to all requests (to resolve an issue with opening protected raw files in new tabs, which is probably a terrible idea that needs rework anyways)
 Proxies paths starting with /api to backend servers
 Interprets other paths as paths to static files and serves them, if they exist
 Finally serves index.html if paths don't match anything
  
All other routing is done in the SPA.
 Why do I want to rewrite the server? There is a very fine-grained role-based authorization scheme managed by the backend. For UX-reasons, some backend responses contain a permission object with some requests (e.t. GET /api/entities/ returns { data: ..., permissions: { create: true } }.
 Setting up accounts for all possible combinations of permissions is tedious, and for some combinations/new functionality, roles don't even exist yet, so I would like to inject permissions to (some) /api/... requets after they return from being proxied to the backend. Express' imperative handler will not let me access the responses after a handler has matched, but with pure functions this should be trivial.
 So, are my use cases supported/possible with HTTPurple? Any suggestions?

 :SURNAME: Doe

 And so on...
 What i would like is to display only the headlines (+content) with say :PLACE:=Fantasy
 And hide the rest
 Now with C-c / i see only headlines marked with > when the property matches and the other
 headlines + content are still there
 With M-g i can go to the next match but all i want is only headlines+content filtered
 and hide the rest
 Is this possible??
 thanks

 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library for refined types in Scala. You can attach predicates (also called "refinements") to types and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 val x: Int :| Positive = 5 val y: Int :| Positive = -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] = -5.refineEither //Left("...") 
 There are many other features including: - Custom constraints - New zero-cost types - Many integrations with other libraries such as Cats, ZIO, Doobie, Decline, Circe...

 1) Are there any cabal build flags that tell it to maximize runtime efficiency, or is the binary I get from just running cabal build as fast the program is going to get? I'm not looking for removing safety, just wondering if debugging support can be removed for a faster run time.
 2) Would someone mind telling me the latest guidance for making a static binary? I know this has been asked many times, but searching around online I see a lot of old advice, and I'm not sure what the most current guidance is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Think about how you probably use magit, especially the log, where you tend to visit commits alongside the history, with the log in one window and particular log items in another window. Magit has a lot of views and these views often list items that can be in turn viewed in multiple ways. This list & item interaction model has a lot of good karma with respect to both architecture and user interaction.
 I'm mainly picking on `org-agenda-list', but not using the full window width always has bad voodoo in Emacs. When I see complex agenda views with a lot of information to the right of the list of items, I think it's neat, but I also think it should be left & right window for those cases so that the functionality can be remixed and viewed in a mix & match kind of way. This is one of the main reasons I'm not building on top of agenda.
 Another reason this works with magit is because of collapseable sections for showing details of items. Vertical organization can hold arbitrary amounts of detail while left-right organization in a single window, well, this isn't a web browser. Organizing information left-right in sections and controlling reflow are likely to not obtain a good result.
 This is related to casually spiking more work on afterburner, only at the pace that I am getting value out for now.

Most of my notes are MUCH smaller than other's, sometimes I can fit the entirety of the idea into the title. So I'm wondering if instead of focusing on reducing the idea I should be adding more of the 'therefores' onto the notes?
For example, I have the following notes, which were titles only in the paper version but I have expanded on slightly in the digital.
The patient's art is only understood through therapy, (Naimberg 1953)
Art seeks reaction, (artlust, 2024)
Art can only truly be understood in relationship
To me, the third one is the 'therefore' of the first two. This is particulary obvious in the digital version where I expand slightly on 'art seeks reaction', because reaction can only happen in relationship. Initially I thought these are three seperate ideas, but now I'm not so sure.
Should I combine the second two notes?]]></summary>

 How can I make images adapt to the width of the window dynamically? Because if the image is too large, it gets cut off halfway (and Emacs crashes many times).
 If this is too hard, How you manage this workflow?
 Sorry for my silly question, but I feel a bit overwhelmed when searching for information with so little learning time. Thank you very much.

 I don't currently have the time to do the entire upgrade myself (although I'd love to try and contribute some hours), and I want to give the upgrade back to the community (as opposed to just keep a private fork).
 What sort of option frameworks exist for this kind of approach to incrementally improving open source in general, and within the Scala specific subdomain?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using projectile for years and it works nicely. However, recently I have noticed that more people recommend project.el because it is lighter and has the backing of the Emacs maintainers. Therefore, I want to give it a try.
 One confusion about project.el is how to specify a project if no version control exists.
 For example, suppose I have the following directory:
 \---myproject | +---subproject1 | \---.git | | Makefile | \---subproject2 \---.git | Makefile 
 How to specify myproject as a project? Note that the myproject itself is under VC. 
 By projectile, I just add a empty .projectile to myproject.
 From Emacs docs:
  
Whether a given directory is a root of some project is determined by the project-specific infrastructure, known as project back-end. Emacs currently supports two such back-ends: VC-aware (see Version Control), whereby a VCS repository is considered a project; and EDE (see Emacs Development Environment). This is expected to be extended in the future to support additional types of projects.
  
Therefore I have to write a back-end by myself? or use EDE which seems rarely used?
 Thanks.

 I have a little brain teaser if anyone is interested.
 I have multiple list of properties (house, apartment, …). Each list comes from a different source. The goal is to group properties to avoid duplicates.
 Because every source has their own way of doing things, it isn’t as easy as group by address.
 I need to come up with a way to group by address, or by geo coordinates, or by bedroom + bathroom + size, or by cover picture, or … some sort of group by similarity score.
 Would anyone have a solution to such problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I am looking for a way to customize my C indentation style in Emacs to fit my school style guidelines.
 One of the guidelines I am trying to implement goes like this: "Each variable declaration must be indented on the same column for its scope", see my example below for clarity. 
 Example:
 int main(void) { int a; int b; int c; } int main(void) { int a; char b; float c; } int main(void) { int a; char b; unsigned char c; } 
 As you can see I have to indent the variables on the same column as their longest neighboring type name basically (C89 style).
 So far, I have dealt with it by remapping my TAB key to insert actual tabs with this elisp snippet: (local-set-key (kbd "TAB") 'tab-to-tab-stop) so I can indent everything manually. It does the job for me but I'm curious if there is a way to make full use of c-mode functionality to do that without having to write a super complicated elisp function that checks if the symbol at point is a C type and then indents it to the right column (with potential backtracking also). 
 I think the short answer is probably no but I'm curious how you would deal with this if you were in my situation or/and if you personally had to do any "hacks" to your c-mode config to fit some project's guidelines. 
 I quickly skimmed through manual, it probably has all the answers I need but nothing really stood out to me at first glance.

Right now I’m looking at Scala, and I really like its features. However, the jvm dependency, while great for some purposes (I do a lot of work in clojure), is a concern for others. One reason I’m looking at compiled languages is for building cli tools as static binaries that can be flexibly copied into docker containers, over ssh, etc.
 I’m curious how practical scala native would be for this purpose, or if I’d be better off using another language for cli tools. What if I wanted to do something that depends on third-party libraries, like image processing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I've recently started using Emacs and found it to be an incredibly cool and powerful editor. However, I noticed that there wasn't a GitHub theme similar to what Neovim offers, so I decided to create one myself. I have developed GitHub dark theme, light, and dark dimmed versions. The theme has been tested on WSL2 running on Windows Terminal, but if you encounter any issues, please let me know on GitHub.
 You can find theme on Github.
 Key Features:
  
Customizable colors for comments, keywords, strings, numbers, etc.
 Support for various modes including org-mode, term, ivy, swiper, and more.
 Compatibility with Emacs 24 and later.
 Easily modifiable to suit personal preferences based on the provided code.
  
Since I'm not familiar with Emacs package managers yet, you can install and use the theme manually as long as autothemer is installed.
 Feel free to customize the theme according to your preferences. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please report them on GitHub :)
 P.S.
 I also tested the themes using the emacs -nw command. Both the dark and light themes work perfectly in the terminal. However, the dark-dimmed theme isn't fully compatible because I couldn't find a suitable color to replicate the greyish tone used in the GUI version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble with citations in my Org-mode documents when trying to include them in QUOTE or EXAMPLE blocks. The current setup I have doesn't allow citar to recognize and insert references in these blocks, which causes issues during LaTeX export.
 #BEGIN_EXAMPLE [cite:citationKey 20] #END_EXAMPLE 
 The above snippet gets rendered in LaTeX as:
 \begin{example} [cite:citationKey] % instead of \cite{citationKey} \end{example} 
 I see two potential solutions, but I'm not sure how to implement them, being quite new to Lisp:
  
Allow Citar to Add References in Blocks: Expand the context variable in citar-org.el to include blocks. Here's the relevant line in the citar code.
 Modify LaTeX Exporters: Ensure that [cite] expressions within blocks get parsed correctly during LaTeX export.
  
What would be the best approach to achieve this? Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated!

 This is for Ubuntu 22.04, using a pretty stock GNOME desktop environment.
 Having just updated emacs to 29.3 by building and installing it myself (under /usr/local), I am having some weird interaction with the GNOME desktop. I run emacs directly, and leave it running for my session. I have (had) the desktop icon fixed in my taskbar. I only just noticed this morning that there was a second emacs icon in the taskbar while the application is running. Hovering over the icon, it reads, "Emacs (Client)". I thought perhaps there was a minor conflict between 29.3 and 29.1, so I removed the fixed icon from the task…]]></summary>

 I've been looking something to make graphic notes like obsidian's canvas for a while now, and I spotted this today. Absolutely brilliant package.
 And the same method(ors-get-id and copy to canvas) works on obsidian-excalidraw as well

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I have trouble setting up mbsync to properly handle deletion in two GMail accounts. They're configured identically ("When I mark a message in IMAP as deleted" = "Auto-Expunge off", "When a message is marked as deleted and expunged from the last visible IMAP folder" = "Move the message to the Trash"), however, the behaviour for them is quite different. For the first one, it is more or less fine:
  
👌 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in inbox moves it to trash
 👌 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in archive moves it to trash
 🤷 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in inbox moves it to archive
 👌 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in archive moves it to trash
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in both inbox and archive does nothing (the email gets removed from my local maildir, but it is still present in GMail web interface)
  
However, for the second account (configured identically) the situation is much worse:
  
🤷 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in inbox moves it to archive
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in archive does nothing
 🤷 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in inbox moves it to archive
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in archive does nothing
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in both inbox and archive does nothing
  
I'd like to have a way to just press a button and send an email to trash folder, without checking where this email comes from.
 Is it something I'm missing, some kind of hidden GMail setting or perhaps something in mbsync configuration? Here's how I configured mbsync: https://pastebin.com/7wR4RCpt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Haskell, why is the following code valid:
 haskell f :: a f = f 
  
Is it because we can infer the return type, together with Haskell not requiring a term to have parameters and being lazy?
  
What I mean is that I can get something similar in ML only in two steps:
 ocaml let rec f (x: 'a): 'b = f x let x : 'a = f () 
  
How does this relate to the halting problem?
 Having a inhabited bottom makes Haskell's type system inconsistent and, hence, unsound (because inconsistency implies unsoundness). So why do we say that it is sound? Do we say that considering just the consistent subset? (I've read the article on fast and loose reasoning).
  
Note: Haskell is my favorite language, so I'm not trying to bash it. I'm writing an assignment for uni on formal logic about consistency in lambda calculus. I would appreciate it if someone could answer as objectively as possible so I can further my investigations on how Turing completeness (the inclusion of general recursion) impacts consistency in type theory.

 (fmap . fmap) sum Just [1, 2, 3] yields Just 6
 But why? a composed fmap, in my understanding, is to "jump" (so to speak) over the structure of 2 functors, in this case Maybe and [] functors. So why is this not an error? Isn't this supposed to run sum on the values of the list?
 I would expect:
 fmap sum (Just [1,2,3]) to yield Just 6, and indeed it does (with paranthesis).
 What am I missing here?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit:
 Even if I follow the types, I get:
 (fmap . fmap) sum :: (Functor f1, Functor f2, Foldable t, Num b) => f1 (f2 (t b)) -> f1 (f2 b)
 where f1 = Maybe, f2 = [], t = [], and Num let's say is an Int, so:
 (fmap . fmap) sum :: Maybe [[Int]] -> Maybe [Int]

 I would like to know if there is a way to have an org-agenda view for today presented in a time-grid view where I can see my notes, state changes, clocks and all the things from logbook?
 The idea is to visualize in a single time-grid view for a day all the logbook related things from my TODOs. So in exactly the same way as the SCHEDULED items are shown on a time grid now, I would like to see notes, clocks, state changes etc for all TODOs.
 If such a view is not possible, I would like to implement it. Is there any advice you can give, or a suggestion, on how I could manipulate the time grid view to display data I parsed from logbooks? I could format it while parsing in any way it is needed but the display of information on the time-grid I am not familiar with.

 If such a view is not possible, I would like to implement it. Is there any advice you can give, or a suggestion, on how I could manipulate the time grid view to display data I parsed from logbooks? I could format it while parsing in any way it is needed but the display of information on the time-grid I am not familiar with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, many ideas from Haskell, mainly those rooted in category theory, have found their way into Scala and become well-established in parts of the community.
 Coincidentally or not, many Scala developers have started to migrate to Kotlin, whose community takes a more pragmatic approach to programming and is less inclined towards category theory.
 Haskell is quite open about its goals, with the slogan “avoid success at all costs.” This philosophy allows them to experiment and conduct language research without chasing mainstream success. I'm curious about the Scala community's vision for Scala's success.
 While Haskell is extremely aware and open about its goal of not chasing success, how aware is the part of the Scala community that promotes Haskell's ideas?
 I'm mainly referring…]]></summary>

 The problem is I'm asked for password twice for each python file I visited. This is not there when I don't have eglot, so I think it is eglot establishing connection or something. I use ssh config to hop 3 times into the remote server, one with public key and other 2 password, so I had to type 6 passwords for each file I opened(and they are all different), which is annoying.
 Does anyone else have this problem? How do you solve it?(make eglot ask for password less often)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm a writer, and a programmer. I've in the past obviously leaned towards vim for my text editing & writing, and have become very comfortable in that environment with vim movements.
 Recently I've decided to give emacs a try (as I've always wanted to), and after hearing about org-mode (& org-novelist, export with pandoc, etc) I wanted to try and move my workflow over to emacs for writing. I have a few questions though:
 What is the best way to move around a text file, in your experience? I'm of course reading through documentation, but things like sexp movement don't benefit much from prose! In Vim I could move to any line and any word with a pretty quick series of inputs: is this possible in emacs?
 What are some must haves in the config? i'm doing vanilla (please don't recommend evil--I want to experience emacs for what it is) This is specifically for writing. I know emacs has thousands of commands, and I can only imagine it has a similar amount of settings (setq's? what are these called?)
 I already have lived a long life with capslock as ctrl (started after i got a HHKB, couldnt' go back) but is there a way to use meta/alt as spacebar instead? I know I said no evil, but space as my leader key has been something of a game change in terms of ergonomics for me.
 Finally I plan on just using bleeding edge, building from source. I know theres some exciting things that have just came out, or will be coming out in 30. Has anyone had any issues using the --pgtk with wayland? It's hard to find any communication about this back and forth online (i suppose a lot of emacs folks are still on mailing lists or on matrix and not reddit/discord)
 I'll appreciate any feedback, even if it's not regarding a question. Thanks so much
 edit: thanks for all the help. I have literally never made a post on reddit in over a decade between many accounts that received such useful input.

 I want to be able to narrow down the candidates to SWITCH-TO-BUFFER not only based on the buffer/file name, but also based on the major mode (or any other information provided by MARGINALIA, for that matter).
 Is there some integration, or some variable I can set? I struggle to believe that no one else has run into this problem, so I am CERTAIN someone has already encountered and fixed this problem.
 I am glad for pointers, advice and recommendation.
 Have a good day, fellow 'macsers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been unsatisfied with existing tree file browser packages for emacs, they all have been too slow for me. 
 Expanding whole tree for bigger projects takes, like, forever, so I'm writing my own.
 It mainly utilities unix tree command output:
 https://gitlab.com/OldManProgrammer/unix-tree
 one functionality it's missing is interactive expand / contract tree, for example:
 ├── assets/ │ ├── images/ │ │ ├── testImage.jpg │ │ └── testImage.png │ └── shaders/ │ └── default.glsl 
 contracted would look like:
 ├── assets/ │ ├── images/ │ └── shaders/ 
 and even more contracted would look like:
 ├── assets/ 
 Before i write my own logic for this, i thought built-in outline-mode could be a perfect fit for this.
 But I've been playing with outline-regexp for quite a while, and i always can't quite get it right.
 if anyone is interested, i can post repo for this later in the comments. Its' pretty simple, but i want to fix few more things.

 as you can see it's subtree shenanigas; now, I tried to re-do the file from scratch, and checking for syntax errors, but everytime i try to C-c C-c the 40th counting box I get this error (with backtrace)

 i tried on Org version 9.6.24, emacs 29.3 and 30, but I always get stuck at the 39th, the 40th throws that error.
 any idea on what i'm doing wrong? I can share the file if that help, it's just a collection of RPGs and Tabletop games that i want to collect, it's nothing too personal, but i would rather get what exactly i'm doing wrong.
 also, I have this at the top of my file: 
 ```
 +begin_src emacs-lisp
 (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "M-RET") 'org-insert-todo-heading) (setq org-checkbox-hierarchical-statistics nil)
 +end_src
 ``` 
 I don't know if it's relevant, but it's worth mentioning.
 thank you all for your help!

 Can someone help me, I want to implement the createNewUser function. If the error already exists, it will return an AlreadyExistsError. If it doesn't it will insert the user in the database and return the UUID.
 Edit: Used generic F instead of IO

 (use-package which-key :ensure t :delight which-key-mode :commands (which-key-mode which-key-setup-minibuffer) :custom (which-key-idle-delay 0.3) (which-key-prefix-prefix "◉ ") (which-key-sort-order 'which-key-key-order-alpha) (which-key-min-display-lines 3) (which-key-max-display-columns nil) :config (which-key-mode) (which-key-setup-minibuffer)) 
 However, which-key-mode is not triggering when emacs starts up. If I navigate to the (which-key-mode) line and C-x C-e, it will activate. This appears to be the only package I'm having this issue with.
 Is there maybe a known list of packages that this one conflicts with?
 Edit: It seems that removing the :commands line fixes this (but results in "function X might not be defined" squiggles for both of the :config commands).

Oh, and while I am at it, for some reason I can now also not find the setting for the new file ID in The Archive!

 Is there a way to get this through Homebrew? I'd like to keep emacs (relatively) up-to-date, but don't have the bandwidth to rebuild it regularly.

 I have a fairly good laptop setup (rtx 4070,i9, 32 gigs) and have been ok with using windows (this is only OS i have ever really used). Recently, I realized that I really just use my laptop for 5 main things: VS Code (mostly for simulations), Browsing, Latex, Obsidian notes, and file explorer (or on the rare ocassions, some MS office software). And I have been really thinking, if it would be possible to maximize my comfort and efficieincy if I could find a way to manuever between these seemesly, at first I thought about downloading Linux (Gentoo/arch/nix) but since I have 0 experience with it, I am unsure if it would just end up making my life harder instead of easier. 
 Then I heard from a friend that I could just use EMACS to combine all of these things and get it pretty close to an OS. I have zero experience with emacs and wanted to ask if it could be the key for this seamless vision I had?
 Thnx !

I looked around for other languages, there are some solutions that says you can pass in key=value parameter in the connection string with your current schema=<schemaName> .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[SOLVED]
 I just built the latest Emacs on Ubuntu 22.04:
 GNU Emacs 29.3 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.33, cairo version 1.16.0) of 2024-06-20 
 It starts with a 10-point font no matter what I do. I'm using the same config that works fine on older versions of Emacs and always starts with a larger font. If I use > Options > Set Default Font, I can select a font that works for *that session only*. If I click on > Options > Save Options, it adds this to my .emacs:
 (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. '(default ((t (:family "Ubuntu Mono" :foundry "DAMA" :slant normal :weight regular :height 143 :width normal))))) 
 Upon reopening Emacs, the font is back to 10 point. This basically makes Emacs 29 unusable.

It might be a “getting old[-er]” thing, but I’ve recently started feeling like documenting the complete set of software projects I’ve worked on that I remember. Not as a CV (an advertisement of paid work), but a comprehensive list of everything.

 For instance, if working on a C/C++/Python project using clang-format, ruff, gnu-indent, or uncrustify to format its source, how do you tell your Emacs to use the same rules according to their settings? Also, how do you keep this on a per-project basis (.dir-locals or similar) ?
 Any advice or anecdotes are welcome :-)

I've always used SyncThing to sync what emacs considers my HOME folder between devices, but I've encountered some problems below with my ELPA folder where packages are installed ("~/.emacs.d/elpa").
 Specifically I noticed that when I upgraded emacs from version 28 to 29 on one machine and then upgraded some packages like pdf-tools and org-mode on that machine, those packages (which SyncThing synced to my other devices) no longer worked on the machines still running emacs 28 because emacs 29 has some new functions that those two packages use, like defvar-1.
 So should I have different ELPA folders for different versions of emacs, e.g., by putting a line in my init.el like (setq package-user-dir (concat "~/.emacs.d/elpa-" emacs-version))?
 Thanks!

 I'm using Jaxson Van Dorn's invoice template from here: https://github.com/woofers/org-invoice-template
 As you can see, the sub-totals for each day are correct, but those subtotals, for some reason I can't figure out, aren't being summed together to arrive at the correct total for the invoice.
 I have scrutinised the formula, but I'm rather new to org table formulas and find the cell references alone difficult to follow, so I can't spot what's amiss. Can someone identify what's going wrong?

 Eldoc shows my function and the parameter names, but none of the available docs for each parameter.

I've honestly avoided writing this post because I don't think I am accurately conveying the issues I'm having but I do really want feedback from you all - Here are some things I'm struggling with.
So first of all, I notice that I'm really stuck in my ways and often seem to write essays rather than notes. In order to avoid stressing about a note being atomic, I try to allow my notes to build up until they naturally can be broken down. However, by then, I feel like the statements are too intertwined and codependent and then I struggle to break things down. This is mainly referring to things I write about from background knowledge but happens with referenced things too.
I really want to know how other people structure arguments, claims they don't believe, and things they don't…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might be kind of an obscure question, but here goes anyway:
 The LaTeX memoir document class has a nice feature to add breaks within a chapter, called \pfbreak (plain/fancy break). What it does is add a couple of lines between paragraphs, when the break is in the middle of the page, and adds 3 asterisks to the top or bottom of the page, when the break is between pages.
 In a regular LaTeX document, I can get it to work fine, but in Org Mode, I'm struggling. The break in the middle of the page works, but if the break is between pages, I don't get the 3 asterisks.
 I figured all I would have to do is add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \documentclass{memoir} to the in-buffer settings, and then use $\pfbreak$ when I wanted to add a break, which seems to be somewhat right, since it works in the middle of a page. Just not the end.
 Any way I can track down what I'm missing, or if this will even work in Org Mode?

This system is inspired by (amongst others) the NixOS module system, which are the magic bits that tie together NixOS configurations and gives NixOS its insane flexibility.
Nickel merging and NixOS modules work slightly differently under the hood, and target slightly different use-cases:
Nickel merge is designed to combine several pieces of configurations which all respect the same contract. This allows an application developer to define the interface of its configuration, and have the user write it in a modular way.
NixOS modules, on the other hand, are designed to combine pieces which not only define a part of the final configurat…]]></summary>

 The person who closest ran into this issue I could find it seems like this person:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/nnuapw/geiser_not_sending_correct_code_to_chicken_repl/
 They were using chicken scheme and it seems like some chicken scheme command fixed it.
 The closest analog I can think of with mit-scheme is there is a Setup.sh script to run (which I haven't), though it seems this requires an already working mit-scheme compiler 😵‍💫
 I am able to run code fine in the geiser REPL 👍

The content should be read-only, but on key press I want to fetch data from a server, generate a collapsible/expandable tree from the result, be able to navigate the items and trigger further actions on the focussed items by more keypresses.
 I'm new to elisp, but data fetching, parsing etc. is not what gives me a headache - I'm familiar enough with Clojure to have a grap of lisps and willing to learn the language "enough".
 The great unknown for me are the emacs internals on how to actually build the ui. Are there any introductions, tutorials or simple examples I can use to learn from? I could start with magit, which does all what I'd like incredibly well, but I feel like that's a little over my head ;)
 Of course, best practices for fetching and parsing JSON are appreciated, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to use Haskell for back-end (paired with Elm for front-end), but I'm not sure about committing to it for two reasons:
  
Haskell's compiler error messages are confusing and feel unhelpful to me. I've been spoiled by Elm and Rust, and languages like Gleam seem to incorporate a similar style of compiler messaging I appreciate.
 I've heard that Haskell is difficult to maintain in the long run. When it comes to packages in my experience, cabal feels a bit less organized in comparison to package systems like Elm's or Crate for Rust.
  
Are there solutions that could make Haskell a winning choice for a language in these aspects, or would I be better to go with something else?
 (As a side note, I admire the direction of Richard Feldman's language Roc, but as it is still a developing language, I would not be keen to invest in that too much at the moment. If you think it's worth it, maybe let me know.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is a little bit strange, but I cannot see any reason why this shouldn't be possible, using various low-level GHC runtime functions etc.
 I want a function that looks like this:
 writeExecutable :: FilePath -> IO () -> IO () 
 Calling writeExecutable fpath action on a Linux machine should create a Linux executable file at fpath that, when run, runs action as if it were main of that executable.
 To be a bit more specific regarding pre-existing state, I want
 writeExecutable fpath action args <- System.Environment.getArgs System.Posix.Process.executeFile fpath args Nothing 
 and
 action System.Exit.exitSuccess 
 to be essentially equivalent, modulo the created file of course. (Bear in mind executeFile is UNIX exec, which does not create a new process but replaces the current process with new code).
 Why do I want writeExecutable? Because I wrote an interpreter and I want to turn it into a compiler for free.
 Does anyone know of any work that's been done in this area (even in another language)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One day, I tried to reflect on why I don't really like EasyMotion-like packages (Avy, Ace-Jump, etc.). It was because they feel too intrusive to my flow - I want to go to a place almost mechanically, without thinking like, "So I need to go to this 'f' symbol, I should type 'f', then wait, read, and type the next symbols one after another" 
 So, I tried to create a package that works the opposite way—you always go to the same place with the same keybindings. E.g., if you type M-s f u p, then you will always be in the top right corner.
 It might be slower at the start, but probably more mechanical, faster, and freeing your head in the end. 
 I wrote an example package and a training game, only to find out later that there exists the package I wanted, but which does it on a system level :) And it is https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd/

 But still want to share my training game - maybe it would be useful :) https://github.com/haukot/dead-eye-jump

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 At work we use 2 indentation styles:
 void shortFunction(int arg1, int arg2, // ..., int argN, int argM) { // ... } void SomeClass::AndAnotherInnerScope::veryLongFunctionNameJustForFun( SomeOtherVeryLongTypeName<MaybeEvenWithTemplate> arg1, int arg2, std::string arg3, ) { // ... } 
 Default tree-sitter indent rules can't cope with that. They weally want to align all arguments to an opening brace, turning second function declaration into a mess.
 I have written my own indentation rule, maybe ugly, but it get the job done.
 It tries to indent first argument by 4 spaces if it is on its own line, and doesn't move it at all otherwise, and everything else is aligned to it.
 (defun lazy/smart-indent (node parent bol &rest _) (let ((first-real-child (treesit-node-child parent 1))) (if (or (not node) (treesit-node-eq node first-real-child)) (save-excursion (goto-char (treesit-node-start parent)) (back-to-indentation) (+ (point) 4)) (treesit-node-start first-real-child)))) 
 Then I had to create my own c-ts indentation style where I changed 2 rules: for argument lists and parameter lists to this:
 ((parent-is "argument_list") lazy/smart-indent 0) ((parent-is "parameter_list") lazy/smart-indent 0) 
 I don't know a good way to do it other than copy existingy styles and patch in place.
 Hope it helps someone.

 I'm relatively new to Emacs, I've watched a few SystemCrafters videos, flipped through the documentation and tutorials. I've started writing my config, but it still looks far from what I want it to look like...
 So I'm here with a question: where can I find more variety of good cofigs for inspiration (and possibly for use)? The usual search on the net and on github gives mostly very outdated builds(
 For the context, I've been on Arch Linux for two years now, I'm switching to emacs from obidian, and I want to fit most of my activities into emacs: PKM (org-roam), Task manager, programming (C, Python, JS), etc

 Edit:
 I tried doing this
 class LiveVendors[F[_]] private ( xa: Transactor[F] )(implicit ME: MonadError[F, String])

 Has anyone experienced this bug with poly-org and org-mode 9.7?

 I see the issue when the buffer glitches from top to bottom, with the cursor moving line by line too fast. It's basically unworkable at this state. 
 My solution is to stay in 9.6 until there is a permanent solution for it. 
 Best.

 This post is not specific to Scala but I like this community so I ask it here.
 What do you think makes more sense for testing API status code and messages returned to the client? Unit testing (and mocking your services)?
 Or Integration testing to test with the real system?
 Thanks!

Since most of the time I'm on very large monitors, I have the base font size set to be readable there, though sometimes I'm on the laptop and need it to scale down a little bit.
 I've done some searching for solutions but seems like the only ones I've come up with are from EmacsWiki (zoom-frm.el). This is fine, but also seems like it requires a lot of additional packages, also from EmacsWiki. 
 Anyone ever tried these solutions? I can go searching through EmacsWiki for all the dependencies and download them if I need to, but the Git repo is absolutely gigantic to try to get small amounts of packages so a bit of a pain. But if they're the miracle cure, I'll do what it takes.
 Also open to other packages that do the job. Just would like to control the text when the laptop is hooked up to dock with big monitors, and when it's just a laptop.

I wanted to try and give emacs a go because I've heard good things about it. However, I'm a bit confused on how to get started with it. Anyone have any resources they recommend to get started? Thanks. Also, i'm wanting to learn C and use emacs as my IDE, I'm on MacOs. I previously learned javascript for around 8 months.

 When exporting an org file as PDF with preview, Emacs creates a new window showing the PDF correctly but also switches the current org-mode buffer to show the same PDF file, as show in this screencast recording.
 It also seems to create a new frame showing the PDF if current frame is "too small", which is not an issue for me.
 What annoys me is something switches the org-mode buffer to the PDF viewing buffer.
 I do not have `display-buffer-alist` rules regarding pdf-tools buffers.
 Have any of you seen this before?

 I have ADHD and it is a struggle to clean up my tasks or rather doing them, I mean I love how I can capture any idea and any to-do for a given project, but doing them ... that is a whole other story. 
 I recently read about how gamification can help people with instant feedback problems, to better work if their tasks are gamified. So my question is, is there a way in emacs, to implement like a point system for tasks, like when im capturing a to-do, give it an value or link the prio of the task to points and at the end of the month, get like a highscore or somehting?
 I was just wondering, if anyone did something like this and can help someone out who is really in need of something like this :D
 Thank you all, and a happy day to you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs Community!,
 I heavily use org-mode src blocks, normally with the ob-shell extension (sh, bash...), I previously worked in a MacOS system where the installation is a little complex, but can be done. Now, I recently got the opportunity to change systems so, I did.
 In a new Debian 12 installation, I have my Emacs installation and, when testing Src code blocks with *:async*, I noticed that my Emacs was still being blocked. This is a fresh installation.
 What I did:
 Run a src code block from the documentation that worked on the MacOS system, but didn't in the Debian. Async should put an ID and then replace it:
  
+begin_src bash :session execute-asynchronously :async yes
 echo "Execute session blocks in the background"
 sleep 20
 echo "Using the :async header"
 +end_src
  
What happened:
  
In MacOS, an ID is put in the results, Emacs doesn't get worked and after the 20 seconds I get the result. Works perfectly.
 
In Debian, Emacs gets blocked, with the message 'Executing Bash code block at position 480'.
 
 Things I've tried:
  
Emacs -Q for a minimal example, same issue.
 
Searched for the ob-async github, nothing related and, no 'requirements' I may have missed, or packages.
 
Searched the web for answers, apparently, this is not an issue that I can find logs about, and given that I am in a new installation, I'm at a loss at what else to check... 
 
 At this point, I'm not sure what do debug, since usage of src code blocks is a must and, the support of Emacs in Linux should be better as I understand, for example, I don't have issues with gpg in Debian, while I couldn't configure it on MacOS.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted to see if anyone here could help me brainstorm a setup using org roam dailies to track my phyisical fitness / lifting goals. I'd like to use org roam dailies to track my body weight, some measurements, my workout lifts, and possibly progress photos sporadically as well. Org roam dailies stores information in a one-file-per-day system where each file is named after the date. I'm comfortable with the templating required to make information entry quick and easy in this system, and have already been tracking all of this on pen and paper for over a year. Organizing and inputting this information is something I've already figured out for myself. I can get somewhat close-ish to the functionality I'm looking for with org-ql, but can't quite get the feedback I'd like displayed the way I want. Ideally, I'd like to be able to make line charts of certain tagged entries in the daily file and plot them over time. Certain things will not be in every single entry. I'm sure there's a way to accomplish this, I have not found the right plugin yet.
 Has anyone here ever used emacs to analyze information this way?

 One is in Scala, it provides a high level of training and supervision and you work with big clients but my fear is whether Scala is future proof as someone beginning their career. 
 The other is in C# in a very small company. I hope the training will be good but there will only be 4 of us so we'll have to see.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to define a custom coding system for PETSCII, that currently uses a custom font with the appropriate symbols in a Unicode Private Use Block #xE000-#xE100. Eventually I'll switch to the Symbols for Legacy Computing block, but for now...
 Finding useful documentation (or even code samples) for creating coding systems has been difficult - any pointers greatly appreciated. At present, the code below 1) decodes the PETSCII properly, but only 7-bits. Characters >#x7F do not get translated. 2) Does not encode properly at all. Everything below #x7F gets translated to #x20 on writing.
 I'm being overly-explicit with some of this code, so excuse the verbosity. I did not include the entirety of 'petscii-unicode-map' here for brevity, but it's just a one-to-one mapping (and I'm hard-coding un-printable symbols ATM):
 (defvar petscii-unicode-map '((#x0 . #xE41D) (#x1 . #xE41D) (#x2 . #xE41D) (#x3 . #xE41D) [...] (#x3C . #xE03C) (#x3D . #xE03D) (#x3E . #xE03E) (#x3F . #xE03F) (#x40 . #xE000) (#x41 . #xE001) (#x42 . #xE002) (#x43 . #xE003) [...] (#xFC . #xE07C) (#xFD . #xE07D) (#xFE . #xE07E) (#xFF . #xE07F))) 
 Then I define a charset (which seems to work), an encode and decode translation-table, then the coding-system itself.
 (define-charset 'petscii-standard "PETSCII coding" :dimension 1 :code-space [0 255] :map (seq-into (flatten-list petscii-unicode-map) 'vector)) (defvar petscii-decode-table (make-translation-table petscii-unicode-map)) (defvar petscii-encode-table (make-translation-table (mapcar (lambda (v) (cons (cdr v) (car v))) petscii-unicode-map))) (define-coding-system 'standard-petscii "PETSCII coding system" :mnemonic ?P :coding-type 'charset :eol-type 'mac :ascii-compatible-p nil :charset-list 'petscii-standard :decode-translation-table petscii-decode-table :encode-translation-table petscii-encode-table) 
 Any help is greatly appreciated. I've dug through mule-conf.el and a few other bits of existing elisp, to no avail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to announce a new release of csound-expression on hackage. The CE is a music framework for haskell with focus on ease of use and feature rich as it rides on top of the powerful audio programming language Csound. It is a DSL to build Csound programs. So the library embeds Csound in Haskell. 
 It's a bug fix release. Many algorithms in the low-level renderer csound-expression-dynamic were rewritten and fixed. In the previous version unforunately there were severe bugs in effectful expressions and in if-then-else blocks. But now they are fixed. 
 Also I've updated the library to include new Csound opcodes (audio processing units from 6.18 version).
 Happy music making with Haskell!
 About the future of the csound-expression:
 I've started the implementation of more tiny csound-core package. It offers a missing layer of low-level building of type-safe Csound expressions. In the previous version I've created lots of abstractions to make music making more pleasant for FP style. But this layering makes it kind of hard to debug rendered code. So I'd like to create a tiny imperative style core that will allow me to debug produced Csound code. And the rest of the code should be expressed in terms of this library. I'm not there yet. I've built the core library and it turned out very well. But now I need to rewrite FP abstractions on top of it. I'm not there yet. But I hope that gradually I will make it. 
 Also I plan to deprecate GUI features as FLTK was deprecated in Csound and it's not packaged with Csound anymore. I think maybe it would be better to substitute them with JS+OSC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted a week or so ago about a problem with consult-register-load. I get this error when using consult-register-load or consult-register-save. Both of these functions work but they do not display the little mini buffer info with the preview and the optional do what you mean stuff that makes consult-register so great.
 Error running timer: (void-function nil) register-read-with-preview-traditional: Non-character input-event 
 This morning I took another swing at working on tracking down this bug. I put together a basic init.el file and ran emacs with -q -l test.el. Then I used M-x package-install-file. Directed it to the consult folder my regular emacs init file uses and found that consult-register-load works flawlessly. So I can eliminate the possibility that this was a bug in consult conflicting with the fact that I'm running emacs 30 or that emacs 30 it self had an issue.
 On the emacs wiki page about timers this line jumped out at me. Seems clear that it is the heart of my problem but I don't know what to do to try and isolate or resolve it.
  
This predicate function returns non-nil if object is a timer.
  
I don't know enough elisp to understand what that means. I'm also confused by what is going on in consult-register.el. Without a deeper understanding of what the offending functions in consult-register.el are doing. I don't know how to proceed. Could someone explain it for me? Any tips on debugging this? Any and all suggestions welcome.
 Full emacs config.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[org-transclusion-http is an extension for org-transclusion that lets you transclude content over HTTP. If you have pandoc installed on your system, org-transclusion will convert HTML documents to Org format and transclude them. It handles link anchors ("fragments") in HTML as well as Org mode documents.
 After installing org-transclusion-http, run M-x org-transclusion-add-all in an org-mode buffer containing the following text:
 # Transclude ~org-mode~ document #+transclude: [[https://ushin.org/software.org#emacs]] # Transclude HTML document #+transclude: [[https://ushin.org/software.html#emacs]] 
 If you are connected to the internet and you have pandoc installed, the contents of those two files should asynchronously load, and the section of each document which matches the #emacs tag will be displayed in place of each #+transclude: link.
 org-transclusion-http is now available on NonGNU ELPA, so you can try it out on Emacs 28+ by running M-x package-refresh-contents then M-x package-install RET org-transclusion-http!

In each hode-mode buffer, there will be some text, and parts of that text will correspond to objects in a TypeDB database. It will need to keep track of (among other things, surely) those correspondences.
 This means I'll have to things in memory that are invisible to the user. The only kind of state I've manipulated previously in Emacs is the text itself.
 The only idea I've come up with so far is to define some global variables starting with "hode-state-", and hope a user doesn't clobber those names.
 Is that how it's done?
 [1] It will use Emacs as a frontend to a TypeDB database, allowing users to maintain personal knowledge bases, like org-roam but with more structure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a package that allows the execution and editing of Pharo "scripts" from Emacs and have come across shampoo-mode and Literate-Smalltalk (Github)
 Off the two literate-smalltalk appears to be the more up to date one.
 The links for shampoo-mode are
 project page in melpa,
 Shampoo mode for Emacs,
 Smalltalk image-side server that provides a remote access to an image,
 and Shampoo SqueakSource which seems to have more support for Pharo.
 
 Does anyone have some familiarity with these two packages?

 [edit]
 Here is a screen video capture for those who want to see more in practice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUsgmQjMB6Q
 Some details about what I'm doing and shortcuts:
 00:00 : navigating and editing trees and list using navigation commands : https://orgmode.org/manual/Motion.html cycling (also works for src blocks) https://orgmode.org/manual/Global-and-local-cycling.html structure editing : https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Editing.html 00:16 : adding src block : C- s then type desired language (bash, python, ...) 01:00 : entering a src block editing mode, C-' then launching python console C-p and select desired code, then send it to console with C-r 01:17 : save and quit src block editing C-' 01:44 : add time stamp, C-u C-u C-c . 01:50 : cycle through todo-keywords C-c C-t 
 There are tons of other features that I don't show, of course. I.e, embedding src block results and plots directly in org mode, jupyter-like style; isolating (sub)tree in buffer; tangle block code; calendar and time alerts; ... I'm far from exploiting the full potential of orgmode. But bit by bit, it progresses. I would say I usually learn (or rediscover ) one or two new shortcuts/feature a week, on average.
 Being able to I-search a keyword in my whole work is probably one of the most time saving feature of working in a single file. I can easily copy and look up for some code or notes I've written already.

I have half a year to prepare to that and to be honest I've been avoiding this as the plague because I find Scala utterly complicated. I'll dearly miss the simplicity of Go with errors as values and everything being async IO by default.
 My first question is: if you had to move from Go to Scala how it was your journey?
 Second, do you need to deal with exceptions everywhere like in Java doing Scala FP? And, how can I know which function will/can throw an exception? For example, in Scala is pretty normal to consume Java libraries, how can I know if I need to put a try/catch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having issues with the Svelte lsp server, using emacs 29 w/ nativecomp and lsp-mode:
  
No highlighting or echo area information when hovering over stuff
 The autocomplete is weirdly sluggish 
 If something is lsp-renamed in a .ts file, the changes are not reflected in .svelte files, and vice versa
  
On the other hand, the typescript server is snappy and seems to work as expected, so now I suspect something may be amiss with the svelte server, and/or the lsp integration.
 The problem persists with the following simple config:
 (setq-default package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")) load-prefer-newer t) (setq-default use-package-always-ensure t) (require 'use-package) (use-package typescript-mode) (use-package web-mode :mode (("\\.html\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.svelte\\'" . svelte-mode)) :config (define-derived-mode svelte-mode web-mode "Svelte") (setq web-mode-engines-alist '(("svelte" . "\\.svelte\\'")))) (use-package company :config (global-company-mode)) (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp) :hook (((typescript-mode svelte-mode) . lsp))) 
 I hope someone can help out, I have no idea how to solve the problem. It seems few people develop svelte using emacs, so it's hard to find information

 This isn't working:
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :weight 'light) 
 I tried with various fonts including Iosevka and Fira Code. I can set the font to "Light" using the "Options | Set Default Font" menu option. I want to do it in elisp though, to auto-toggle between light and regular depending on whether I'm using a dark or a light theme. (A lighter weight can look nicer with dark themes.)
 Curiously setting it to a bold weight does work. In one case the font I tried didn't even have a bold weight, but Emacs synthesized it. Which is cool, but I can't set it to a light weight using elisp.
 I tried using the :fontattribute and building a font spec string manually, but it was inconsistent. Sometimes it would take effect, other times not, and I couldn't set the italicface to light and italic.

 I’ve been working on a Bash script to simplify running Emacs and Emacsclient, and I wanted to share it with you all. Whether you’re frequently starting and stopping Emacs servers or switching between different profiles, this script can save you time and streamline your workflow.
 Here’s what it does:
  
Start an Emacs server with a specified profile or initialization directory.
 Run Emacsclient in terminal or GUI mode based on provided arguments.
 Kill running Emacs servers easily.
 List available Emacs server socket files.
  
How to use it:
 (assuming you added the script to your path)
 Help Message:
 ec -h 
 Displays the usage message with all available options.
 Script Version:
 ec -v 
 Shows the script version.
 Start Emacs Server with Profile:
 ec -p my-profile 
 Starts the Emacs server with the specified profile.
 Start Emacs Server with Init Directory:
 ec -i /path/to/init-directory 
 Starts the Emacs server with the specified initialization directory.
 Run Emacsclient in Terminal Mode:
 ec -nw 
 Opens Emacsclient in terminal mode.
 Kill Emacs Server:
 ec -k 
 Kills the Emacs server processes.
 List Socket Files:
 ec -l 
 Lists the available socket files for Emacs servers.
 EmacsClient Options are supported
 All the regular emacsclient options are supported, so you can for example specify a different server to run it, for example:
 Create an emacs server in org mode
 emacs --bg-daemon=demo-server --init-directory ~/init-directory/testing-org-config 
 use ec to open emacsclient with daemon named demo-server on line 23 of a file
 ec -s demo-server +23 ~/my-file.org

However, I don't love the Emacs Lisp source code for it, or for org agenda, it looks somewhat involved and painstaking, I was wondering if there are any more high level libraries for creating images in an emacs buffer, in particular colored images (which presumably would have to implement the coloring through font lock? not sure if there's a better way)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs Community!,
 I'm trying to define a complex workflow where:
 I get My Github Issues
 #+name: gitlabGetIssuesAssignedToMe
 #+begin_src sh
 curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: ${GitlabPersonalAccessToken}" "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/issues?scope=assigned_to_me"
 #+end_src
 I get a specific Issue via iid.
 #+name: getIssue
 #+begin_src sh :stdin gitlabGetIssuesAssignedToMe() :var iid=""
 jq --arg iid $iid '.[] | select(.iid == ($iid | tonumber))'
 #+end_src
 I get the description of a specific one via iid too
 #+name: getIssueDescription
 #+begin_src sh :stdin getIssue(iid="2495")
 jq '.description'
 #+end_src
 The problem is that, while this is working:
 +call: getIssue(iid="2495")
 This is not working, as I'm still seeing the results of 2495 as in the getIssueDescription definition, I have "2495" still.
 +call:getIssueDescription(iid="2498")
 I have also tried to put just iid so that I pass it, but no luck.
 So in this case, I want to change the variable of a chain of functions. I'm still trying but, haven't found how...
 Thanks for looking into this specific issue!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, has anyone had success using `eglot-workspace-configuration` in a `.dir-locals.el` to pass configuration to Microsoft's PyRight LSP? Am I doing something wrong below or is this not supported by either eglot or pyright?
 I am experienced with directory local variables and elisp, but beginner in pyright and eglot although I have read docs for both.
 ./foo.py:
 import sys import sys print(sys.argv) 
 ./.dir-locals.el:
 ((nil . ((eglot-workspace-configuration . (:python (:reportDuplicateImport t)))))) 
 `M-x eglot-show-workspace-configuration` output:
 { "python": { "reportDuplicateImport": true } } 
 In this simple case I expect the duplicate `import sys` in the python file to be flagged, but it is not, thus pyright is not using the config. It did use the config and flag the expected python line when I tried using the "pyrightconfig.json" file mentioned in pyright docs. So pyrightconfig.json file works, but in this case I want to use eglot-workspace-configuration. In fact I would like to use a hybrid of both (ie pyrightconfig.json checked into shared repo, and eglot-workspace-configuration on my local machine). Any tips? Thanks.

As readers and reviewers, we have all been irritated, be it a bit or a lot, by not being able to find easily a key definition that was given sometimes hundred pages before (in a PhD thesis for instance). Using the knowledge package, every use of a concept becomes one click away from its definition (in the electronic version of the document), and an index with all its occurrences can be easily maintained (for the printed version of the document). The longer is the document, the more it improves the reader's experience, but it already helps in conference papers.


A draft book written with the knowledge package is My First Category Theory Textbook by Ralph Sarkis.
Zettelkasten.de forum members might find the package particularly helpful for $(\LaTeX)$ mathematics documents, but mathematics isn't the only application.]]></summary>

Also, how do I want to break up these ideas where there are so many different ways I could do so?
I found a post response by @andang76 where he described the "train of thought" method of brainstorming he uses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying out this new 'pattern' for giving a typed interface on top of Akka actors. Here's an example using classic untyped actors (based on https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/actors.html):
 import akka.actor.Actor class MyActor extends Actor { private var num = 0 def receive = { case "incr" => num += 1 case "decr" => num -= 1 case "get" => sender() ! num } } object MyActor { trait Trait { def incr: Unit def decr: Unit def get: Future[Int] } class Client(ref: ActorRef) extends Trait { import akka.pattern.ask override def incr: Unit = ref ! "incr" override def decr: Unit = ref ! "decr" override def get: Future[Int] = (ref ? "get").mapTo[Int] } } 
 This is inspired by the Erlang/Elixir style of having modules with a 'client' portion that wraps the actor's 'protocol' ie the messages that it sends or receives, in a normal class with normal methods. This 'client' class in Scala can also implement an interface which can be used by callers to abstract away the 'implementation detail' of being an actor under the hood.
 val myActorClient = new MyActor.Client(ref) myActorClient.incr myActorClient.decr myActorClient.get.map(println)

 "Hooks are an important mechanism for customizing Emacs. A hook is a Lisp variable which holds a list of functions, to be called on some well-defined occasion. (This is called running the hook.) The individual functions in the list are called the hook functions of the hook. For example, the hook kill-emacs-hook runs just before exiting Emacs (see Exiting Emacs).
 Most hooks are normal hooks. This means that when Emacs runs the hook, it calls each hook function…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I've been playing with FP libraries in Python and JavaScript.
 Because those languages do error handling with their native try catch mechanisms, most of the code I could see that make use of those FP library looks like the following.
 Isn't it strange to mix both try/catch and the Either monad?
 I get it. It allows us to keep a full FP error handling core and logic.
 But the function implementations still make use of try catch. There are obviously no way around it.
 Those libraries can be used as FP wrappers.
 I guess the same applies in Scala when using Java libraries.
 What are you thoughts about it?

 flash.nvim do other cool stuff like selecting a function or an expression by using treesitter (i really don't know how it works really), like you would trigger the plugin in another way and then you will see characters suggestions to where to jump or select.
 is there something like this in eamcs? i'm sure there is but i didn't know what to type in google to find anything

 Is there a way to write a function where every time I paste something, it increments the number for me? Optionally, does something like this already exist?
 p.s.: I have a snippet where I can increment the number under point, but that means navigating to the number and invoking that function. I would rather keep pasting the snippet and have the correct number show up. Probably a global counter which gets incremented on paste.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started using Emacs 6 months ago and I love it! I use it for everything, from keeping notes, scheduling tasks to keeping bookmarks.
 Recently, after reading an article on using Emacs as a password manager through auth-info and epa packages, I started to implement it in my own workflow. 
 I wonder if this is seen as a security risk for some reason. I know Emacs is open source and packages are open source but there are many packages one uses and it is not possible to audit everything even if you knew Elisp to that extent (which I don't). I am not using some obscure code but lots of some rather well known packages mainly related to org.
 I am somewhat worried that if I use epa package and decrypt some stuff in Emacs that there will be a small posibility that one of tens of packages is spying on me and may see the decrypted data. It seems like a case of paranoia to me but I'm curious to what your thoughts on this are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Sorry for yet another "why doesn't my shit work" post, but why doesn't my shit work.
 I'm using doom emacs config, with Emacs 29.1
 I have successfully enabled treesitter for typescript/tsx, javascript, and rust, so I don't think it's my treesitter config...
 Switching from go-mode to go-ts-mode drops syntax higlighting, but all of the other aspects of treesit mode, like treesit-explore-mode work. Interestingly, nil is highlighted in my .go files, but nothing else is.
 I know that typescript/tsx have a known bug that requires downgrading to a specific version, but I don't know how anyone discovered that bug so that I can replicate and perhaps downgrade go as well.
 I'm pretty new to emacs, and have only really started scratching the surface of how to customize it to my liking, so tips on how to debug would also be super helpful!
 treesit config:
 (setq treesit-language-source-alist '((go "https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-go") (gomod "https://github.com/camdencheek/tree-sitter-go-mod"))) (setq treesit-font-lock-level 4) 
 maybe relevant go config?:
 (setq lsp-go-use-gofumpt t) (eval-after-load 'flycheck '(add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-golangci-lint-setup)) (add-hook! 'go-mode-hook (which-function-mode 1) (flycheck-select-checker 'golangci-lint) (add-hook! 'before-save-hook #'lsp-format-buffer t t) (add-hook! 'before-save-hook #'lsp-organize-imports t t)) 
 Let me know if there's anything else I can include that might be screwing with treesitter :)

 As you can see before I ran emacsclient there was already existing emacs frame. According to the help:  -r, --reuse-frame Create a new frame if none exists, otherwise use the current Emacs frame 
 What am I doing wrong? Why emacsclient cannot reuse the frame?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be honest, I don't know why only now, after years of using Emacs, I have realized that I have never attempted to figure this out, in many regards, quite important feature of any text editor.
 I want to find a good, predictable way to jump between places. Not just within a single buffer or same window - between windows, tabs and frames. 
 So this is what I want:
  
I would be typing something in one buffer (matter of fact I'm typing this very message in an Emacs buffer), let's call it t1/w1/b1, okay?
 
Then I would move the cursor to the top of the buffer, to fix a mistake.
 
Then for whatever reason I would switch to another window, right next to my current window&buffer - let's call it t1/w2/b2, and then type some other stuff.
 
Then, I would switch to another tab (I'm using tab-bar-mode) where it finds t2/w1/b1
 
 Now, is there a way to:
  
Pressing a key to jump to the previous tab, window, and buffer? So in my case pressing the key would take me first to t1/w2/b2, pressing it again to t1/w1/b1 at the top of b1, and then if I press again - to the end of it.
 
Seeing and using the jumps history in the minibuffer.
 
 Is there a good package that works this way? Emacs has powerful position system, how is something like this is not a thing? Or maybe I just don't know about it yet? 
 Doom Emacs uses better-jumper, but it works within a single window or buffer, it can't take you across different windows, tabs and frames. And because of that, it feels super unpredictable, I never know where better-jumper-jump-backward would take me next.
 There are Evil marks and built-in Emacs markers, but they also don't seem to have cross-window-tab-frame functionality.
 What is you recommendation for this problem?

 —-
 I’m exporting to html because I’ve failed at setting up pdf export on my Mac. I use code blocks to get something like a breakout text block… but all white space seems to get eaten and it just gets very “wall of text”. And the text blocks are full screen/scale but the text wraps at my eMacs width. 
 Can I get it to just export a look like the eMacs faces? Italics get broken in quote boxes. Newlines without an extra line get wrapped into a wall. Etc etc, I’m sure we’re all familiar with this. 
 I eventually want to learn how to format correctly and get it all working… but I don’t want to delay sharing my doc for the week that will probably take me to figure out. ;)
 Any pro tips appreciated. Is html just the wrong way and I need to bite the LaTex bullet? It was crazy how funky it seemed to be to get it going. 
 Thanks.

 What kind of monad is used here? The only types involved are Nums and afaik Num isnt a monad. I suspect that its the ((->) a) monad but i dont know its name so i cant research it, plus no links in Control.Monad for it.

 It is my first post here, and i want to introduce the devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge project! This feature brings auto-completion to your Emacs setup within development containers, using the powerful lsp-bridge.
 What is it?
 The devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge automates the setup of language servers supported by lsp-bridge inside your devcontainers. By using Nix packages, it ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, making it easier than ever to get started with Emacs and language servers in a containerized development environment.
 Key Features:
  
Auto-completion in devcontainer
 Support for multiple languages
  
Check out the repository for more details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep noticing that some Emacs users seem to not be familiar with keyboard macros, and even those that are familiar with them aren't always familiar with the fact that there's a counter facility associated with them so you can do things like giving every #define in a block of C code a distinct associated value or what have you in a few keystrokes.
 Multiple cursors are sometimes the right tool, but some of the things people do with them are probably better done with keyboard macros. If you don't know about them, you should.

Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking.

Here is a report on the ideas I'm exploring with my ZK and why I'm here:
The difference between who I am now and who I was five years ago is largely due to how I've spent my time along the way.

Whenever I tried viewing a pdf for the first time, I would get a void variable error for org-format-latex-header. Even though this is declared as an obsolte variable in org-compat.el, its replacement is not defined at the time the pdf is opened. I am not sure what is the canonical way to solve this. Should I just (require 'org-latex-preview) in my init.el or is there a cleaner approach like passing some parameter to use-package?

 I've going around my head and investigating as for a way to finally implement all my email setup in Emacs, which is:
  
3 Gmail accounts that I can implement with .authinfo and application passwords
 
2 Gmail account that I can't
 
1 Microsoft Exchange account where I can't use app passwords and, when configuring davmail, I needed authorization (actually asking for it)
 
 My problem is the latter two, where in case I got lucky and manage to fight my case and get my app password in the Exchange one, I would still will be unable to use the 2 Gmail accounts that don't have application passwords activated.
 I could configure Davmail for exchange, now, not sure about the other two gmail accounts... I think davmail only works for Microsoft.
 Is there, perhaps something like davmail that I can use across all of my accounts?, since application passwords aren't considered secure, in the case these are eliminated, I wouldn't want my accounts to stop working...
 How complicated would be to implement this? (elisp developer), is there perhaps a protocol that is not implemented in Emacs?, something like ouath2 which I think has a package. How technically complicated is this and, how much would it take?. Or is there perhaps, a different more updated way that I don't know of?.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running EMACS 29.3, I get the messaage package cl is deprecated on start (been going on for a while--it was deprecated in 28 or 27, IIRC). I believe this is associated with the [simplenote2](https://github.com/alpha22jp/simplenote2.el) package. I use one of it's functions (creating a note), I get the message format: Symbol’s function definition is void: math-fixnum. If I create a note on the browser, I can edit it in EMACS to my heart's content. I just can't make a new one. 
 My suspicion, as I said, is it's related to the cl package. I was going to try to dig into the code to see if there is a fix, but I wanted to ask before digging into that: is there some standard fix/best practice/shim that can be applied to fix this?

I think many of my notes are more of mini-essays rather than individual zettels. If so, how would I turn this into individual zettels? How do I know how far to break something down and when does it get too much? Sometimes I feel like every sentence could be turned into a zettel.
Side note: I use links instead of tags for categorization - not sure if I love this method but it's whats been working for a bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work on a lot of parallel features in the same very large git repo, so I've been making use of git worktrees and treating each worktree as a separate projectile project. Usually the worktree is named ~/reponame/feature_im_working_on. 
 However, because the repo is so big, and because the build cache takes so long to initialize, I don't want to create a new worktree every time I start a new feature. mv'ing the worktree unfortunately breaks the build cache, for reasons of stupid build system that's out of my control. What I'd really like to do is have ~/reponame.real/a ~/reponame.real/b ... and symlink those to ~/reponame/my_feature. But projectile and project.el notice that its a symlink and name the project ~/reponame.real/a. I've been looking for a way to prevent this behavior, and just use the symlink as the project name, and I haven't found it. Has anyone else done something like this with their workflow? Or do I need to hack the project.el source and add this?

 One area I wish could be smarter is completions. I use corfu and cape; I would love it if Eshell were super smart about completing commands, sub-commands (like with git), control flags, etc. I have some configuration around this, but I'm not happy with it.
 How do you configure Eshell and your completion-at-point mechanisms to be as smart as possible?

 I am trying to establish a LaTeX workflow, and ideally would like to use pdf-tools (or something similar) because well, everything works that way all within emacs. However, the rendered pdf doesn't feel quite snappy and fast as a standard pdf viewer like Zathura or even firefox's pdf viewer.
 Is this a known issue with pdf-tools, or is there something that I would have to change in the config to make it work seamlessly with emacs and auctex?

I found a discussion on stackoverflow suggesting a config like this: (setq url-proxy-services '(("no_proxy" . "\(localhost\|10.*\)") ("http" . "proxy.com:8080") ("https" . "proxy.com:8080")))
 (setq url-http-proxy-basic-auth-storage (list (list "proxy.com:8080" (cons "Input your LDAP UID !" (base64-encode-string "LOGIN:PASSWORD"))))) 
 (I can find similar examples elsewhere also)
 ... the url-proxy-services seems to work, as I can see the request hit the proxy. But the url-http-proxy-basic-auth-storage seems to not work, as the proxy logs include a DENY with "Authentication required", and when I look at the traffic with the request to the proxy, it doesn't include any authentication.
 Has anyone had any success getting this working? It's emacs 27.2 on OpenSuSE.
 Thanks

 Think of "region/State" field, they are of course fixed (at least in the short term) but different on each country. I can see two different ways to handle it:
  
Manually change the file with the enum, simple
 
Keep them on a database and use set to generate the code automatically, cam make people nervous with this self-modifying code thing
 
 What would be the preferred approach in Scala?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I am using borg for package management for my Emacs config. I've been thinking about incorporating some TDD into my Emacs config. I want to try out Ecukes, but it doesn't seem too compatible with Borg. Whenever I try to run 'eask install-deps', it gives the error "Package not installable 'ecukes'; make sure the package archive (source) is included". I managed to trace the error to the following function in eask in lisp/_prepare.el:
 (defun eask-package-installable-p (pkg) "Return non-nil if package (PKG) is installable." (assq (eask-intern pkg) package-archive-contents)) 
 Since I use Borg, I don't appear to be setting the variable package-archive-contents. What would be the right way to go about solving this issue?

 Anybody have any ideas? I looked at the register.el file but I'm not good enough with elisp to do more than guess at what is causing the problem. I've included my consult settings from my init file in case I'm missing a setting.

 Edit for more info:
 I did think it was coming from the company package so I have it commented out and still the completions continue to show. Here's my init.el snippet: https://imgur.com/CmKvnD0, and here's the output of M-x describe-mode which shows that company is active: https://imgur.com/a/m1c407M (this is after doom sync, full restart of emacs)
 Apparently M-x company-mode toggles it and then the suggestions go away, but that only seems like a local change. Could you help me understand what is happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've finished reading Learn You a Haskell and I'm currently following a tutorial on monad transformers I found online. The exercise is implementing MaybeT.
 The author makes MaybeT an instance of MonadTrans as follows:
 instance MonadTrans MaybeT where lift = MaybeT . (liftM Just) 
 I'm a little confused initially, so I open my code editor and get the type annotation for lift, which makes it clear instantly: it takes a value in the base monad to produce a value in the transformed monad, with that same base and Maybe as a precursor.
 So I implement it on my own:
 lift :: (Monad m) => m a -> MaybeT m a lift x = MaybeT $ do x' <- x return $ Just x' 
 My code editor suggests a refactoring here, which I end up agreeing with:
 lift x = MaybeT $ do Just <$> x 
 And then the thought occurs to me that lift could be implemented generally, like so:
 lift x = MonadT $ do return <$> x 
 But then the author asks, as an exercise: why is it that the lift function has to be defined separately for each monad, whereas liftM can be defined in a universal way?
 So I know I must've gotten something wrong somewhere here; but where exactly? Is it that using return makes sense in the context of Maybe, but it doesn't in some other monad?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The math symbols are (way) smaller than the default font.
 Recently, I've been fighting with org-pretty-entities to customize some behaviors. My latest endeavor is "why the UTF-8 character for math symbol are so small compared to the default font?". FYI, this happens in org-mode and LaTeX-mode.
 When looking into the characters itself, some clues I've gathered:
  
the faces applied are font-latex-math-face and font-latex-sedate-face. Unfortunately, changing the height in any of those cause other parts to be comically large (math-face is also applied to the rest of the math block, sedate-face is applied to any latex command like \underbar).
 
the font used to display those characters is mac-ct:-*-Apple Symbols-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 despite my default supporting it (both mono and variable pitch are nerd font).
 
 Right now I am mostly suspecting the issue is the font that is being applied, but I am not sure how to fix it. Even when using (set-face-attribute 'font-latex-math-face nil :family "NotoSans Nerd Font"), it keeps using the aforementioned font.
 Actually, the describe-char gives me the following info (some kinda of character composition? Not really that expert in Emacs):
 display: composed to form "\alpha" (see below) Composed with the following character(s) "alpha" by the rule: (?α) The component character(s) are displayed by these fonts (glyph codes): α: mac-ct:-*-Apple Symbols-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#xA1E) 
 Any help would be appreciated.

 I like to keep my non built-in package count very, very, lean. I understand that there are probably some practical benefits to using these programming language specific modes but I just don't like the idea of picking a package for every programming language, learning all the complexities of each of them, and using LSP, and using tree-sitter. It just seems like a lot.
 I also don't know how to autmatically enable LSP and tree-sitter when editing certain file types without hooking into these modes.
 I'm very new and just looking for some Emacs wisdom. Thank you.

 FWIW I'm using emacs-plus on mac, but this seems to be noticed by others too. E.g. https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-06/msg00012.html
 Applause to our devs who support such amazing software on their free time!

 What are you favorite Emacs spaced repetition packages/flows? Do they also extend to iOS?
 Regardless of whether or not your workflow extends to mobile, what's your favourite Emacs package for spaced repetition?
 Currently playing with org-drill and anki-editor to get a feel for these too. Any other I should consider?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please skip this reading, it's just a message about me and Emacs.
 I was ready to write a rant.
 Then I gave up and started to breathe and think.
 I've been an Emacs user for a couple of years and have learned a lot but I'm still pretty dissatisfied.
 But dissatisfied with what? Not about Emacs. Not about the packages I use. The truth is that I'm dissatisfied with myself using Emacs, mostly because I'm lazy, that's the sad truth. Emacs is not for lazy people like me. Emacs is a demanding teacher. It requires you to be focused, focused and disciplined. So I decided to completely change my approach. I stopped compulsively trying any piece of package I found on Reddit. I decided to read and study Lisp, starting from the basics, the commands and the basic architecture.
 My frustration is driven by my ignorance. Above all.
 Emacs isn't for me when I think I can find a baked solution on satckoverflow.
 Emacs is not for me if I expect to have every package well documented in detail.
 Emacs isn't for me when I think one package can solve all my problems.
 Emacs is not for me if I think Emacs can organize chaos in my head.
 But I also found the main problem in Emacs: it causes dependency.
 Once you try it you can't stop using it, you can't stop thinking about it, you can't stop trying to find new solutions. Learning Emacs must be done in an organized and programmatic manner.
 I'm not a developer, nor a programmer, I'm mostly an aspiring programmer (I use R and a little Python), but the way Emacs forces me to stay focused on what I'm doing, to organize my notes, my documents, my GTD is something new and somehow irreplaceable.
 Thank you all. Thanks Emacs. And sorry for the unnecessary message.

 When I launch gnus, I am prompted for my password, and then dumped into an empty buffer with a minibuffer message saying "no news is good news". I get the same behavior using the wrong password too, so I am not even sure if it is trying to connect to the server. Those options in my mail-sources are what is given to me by Gmail when I look into their "Configuring your email client" instructions. How do I debug this?

The temporal and accreting nature of analog Zettelkasten as its main benefits
Why does analog Zettelkasten work so well?
In [1] I discussed how analog Zettelkasten cures my perfectionist tendencies, as opposed to digital systems, by making editing cumbersome. I also believe that a key benefit of an analog system is being able to trace the development of my thoughts over time.
This idea goes against the views of many digital Zettelkasten aficionados, who believe that their Zettelkasten should reflect their current view of each idea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I enjoy the code-writing experience Emacs and the community provides. But this is the 8th year since I joined the party and I still feel overwhelmed. Usually when I write code, random "problems" still show up here and there, even I have "solved" a lot in the past.
 By "problem", I mean issues, warnings, behaviors that don't work the way I like, configurations I have to choose and balance, even functionalities I used to know but forget their shortcuts, function names or triggers.
 If I ignore those "problems", they will just stay there and continue to popup every now and then until I upgrade the whole packages and hoping those problems get automatically solved.
 If I solve them, it usually take some time which will interrupt my normal workflow. This is annoying.
 There are two solutions I can think of:
  
Either "problems" get fewer as time goes (which is usually not the case). or
 I get control over Emacs and can solve every "problem" really quickly.
  
In terms of option 2, what can I do? Should I
  
get better at common lisp?
 read more packages' source code?
 remember more built-in elisp functions?
 write a package from start?
 just spare a fixed amount of time fixing Emacs problem every day?
  
What's your experience and solution? What's your advice to people like me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using Obsidian / VSCode for many years now, but wanted to 'get the hang of' Emacs to see why it is regarded as the most efficient way to manage code/info. The last time I used Emacs was in the 90's but I don't recall it being extra special at the time. (I probably wasn't looking at all the features though)
 I am feeling good about Emacs now - I find myself working pretty easily with it, and am finally getting the hang of some of the shortcuts (it was really difficult at the start to not C V )
 CSV editing is great - columns can be aligned easily
 Dired mode is the real bonus - apart from the initial oddness of clicking a folder and having it open in the next buffer, I am now loving it. It is really quick to jump around and edit multiple files, and the directory list itself is great to copy quickly from (making a lot of tiny CSV files). The marking of files via regexp is fantastic, and there are so many little things that make working just that bit easier.
 So, I have uninstalled VSCode and am using Emacs full time for coding now (still using Obsidian - the markdown links are a bit borked so I need to do some scripting to convert them so they work nicely)

 I installed the GUI version on windows 10 and one thing I have trouble figuring out is how to make the cursor position visible as in the lower part of this image which is taken from a screenshot of "Emacs from Scratch" 
 I would like to have something similar so I can find my position in the buffer. Unless I type something I do not know where in the line my cursor is (as in the upper part of the image)
 So far I only managed to set the hl-line-mode on so I can at least find the line I'm in, but several things I tried to put in my config that I found in various forums led me to believe that I perhaps do not know the correct terminology for this setting.
 I tried
 (setq-default cursor-type block) 
 and 
 (setq make-pointer-invisible nil) 
 and tried changing the cursor color, but it didn't make it visible. 
 Any help would be appreciated, I'm sorry for asking such a basic question but I could not figure it out with googling it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have released version 0.6.0 of Kele, the spritzy Kubernetes management package for Emacs. Changelog here.
 Note: This release bumps the minimum required version of Emacs to 29.
 This release introduces the notion of kind-specific keybindings. Some resources have special "actions" associated with them, e.g. "restarting" Deployments or getting logs from Pods. kele-resource now has a dedicated column for these keybindings that, when defined, are dynamically filled in based on the selected resource kind. For now, there is only one resource-specific keybinding—R to restart a Deployment. Try s-k deployments to check it out.
 https://preview.redd.it/5orkdwttqb5d1.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e4da9c9ea2fc30a47556085f7c23c5e7483f5c
 In addition, individual bindings within kele-resource are disabled based on your permissions for the given context/cluster. In other words, if you don't have permission to list Pods within the selected cluster, Kele will disable the l keybinding with a helpful message.
 https://preview.redd.it/jkvqq4tuqb5d1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=474adba750c5dffb6a8f58cb03566fc92ff4cbdf
 Lastly, this release fleshes out the resource listing functionality. Some highlights:
  
In addition to opening a resource from the list view (RET), you can now also delete/kill the resource at point with k;
 The list view now shows the owner resource(s) for every list item; hitting RET with your cursor over the owner cell will instead open the owning resource;
 The list view now supports listing across all namespaces.

 For more details, see the Kele documentation. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you'd like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.
 Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've noticed that recording a macro when having a special input-method enabled (say TeX) and using isearch, the macro is terminated by ringing of the bell. I've found that one of the functions called is isearch-with-input-method (isearch-x.el), and it calls exit-minibuffer; commenting out that call, even though some things behave funny, at least doesn't terminate the macro. It also works if I disable the input-method temporarily, then use isearch, and simply turn it back on if I have to input something specific to the input-method; that however rules out any searching for special characters, which isn't ideal at all. Is there a way to remedy this? It seems strange to me that one shouldn't be able to record a macro simply due to using an input method... Help greatly appreciated! I'm using Emacs 30 from homebrew-emacs-plus.

I am an early stage PhD student for computer science.
I've been using a Zettelkasten-esq system in Typst (a LaTeX alternative) to keep track of my research, coursework, and a few serious hobbies.
My current in-Zettelkasten obsessions include disparate but I-swear-they-make-sense-in-my-head subjects such as:
Vector databases and sparse graphs
Package queries and user defined functions
Matroid theory
Theory of order statistics
Whatever is going on in that feud between invasive biologists and conservation biologists
Early 20th-century Christian socialism
I am a little bit of a bat who is just passable enough at seemingly unrelated topic in databases and mathematics to eek out some papers. As a professor told me, it's easier to be first than to be the best. And, if you're not cut out for pure mathematics, just get into applied-applied-applied mathematics of computer systems!
My current Zettelkasten iteration is a bit weird; if it matures and stands the test of time, I may divulge further. Its main principle is to help me keep on chugging along and do some real work.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently done some work where I wrote a parallel test loop for QuickCheck (QC). I did this in collaboration with Koen Claessen, Nicholas Smallbone, and Bo Joel Svensson.
 It is not merged in the QC repository yet, and it will take some time (it is a significant change). I must have implemented five different versions along the way, and what is there now is a mix of all of them. I am happy with the end result, but had to rush a bit in the end to reach a deadline. There is some wonky code lingering around my fork that will go away in due time.
 If you would like to try it out before it gets merged, I have written up some instructions in the link below. I have also included some of my results as well as links to both the code and paper :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This isn't Scala specific, but I thought it would be a good place to ask.
 I'm working on forming my thoughts on error handling, and I'm looking for any existing writing that I should be aware of. Specifically I'm looking for anything that compares and contrasts control flow driven (ie. exceptions) and data driven (unions, tuples, monads of various flavors, etc.) error handling.
 Other free food for thought: It seems like as of 2.13 the Scala ecosystem had pretty well settled into data driven error handling of various flavors. With Scala 3 there are new options on the horizon for control flow based error handling. Interestingly things like boundary break syntax for error handling in ox looks very much like monadless syntax, but works totally different under the hood.
 disclaimer: when I say control flow driven error handling, I don't mean the anti-pattern of intentionally using exceptions for control flow

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Generally I have been enjoying reflex but this time I've stuck with what seems like a very simple feature for days! Hopefully someone can help.
 Let's say I have a dynamic list of some value and a delay Dynamic t [(Text, NominalDiffTime)]
 I've been trying to end up with an Event t Text which would be an event stream that fires as many events as there were in the list with very limited success.
 This event stream should be triggered by another event Event t ().
 I've been trying something like
 haskell performEvent $ ffor theTriggerEvent $ \_ -> do valuesAndDelays <- sample . current $ valuesWithDelays ... construct the event stream 
 but the problem is that I can't use delay inside Performable.
 I have a gut feeling this is some sort of a fold but I can't wrap my head around it.

Created the project folder.
 Created a python file in it (<filename>.py)
 Initialized a git repository in it and committed the above file: git init; git add .; git commit
 Added an empty ".projectile" file in the folder
 Made sure my projectile-project-search-path is set to "~/"
 Ran projectile-discover-projects-in-search-path and verified that it was able to discover other projects
 Ran projectile-add-known-project and selected the folder
  
Up to step 6, it doesn't discover the folder as a project. When I do step 7, it seems to add the project folder to the list of projects, but when I try to switch to it, it complains that the directory is not a project, and then removes it from the list.
 Here's the directory after I create it:
 project/
 ├── .git
 ├── .projectile
 └── script.py
 What do I have to do?!!!!

 It is only possible to turn off a specific set of rules by recompiling the source files with those RULES pragma commented out? Then if want to turn off rules written in the base package, is it true that I will have to hack it and recompile the base package myself? Many thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When writing elisp code and looking for a function that would do something you need, what do you use to find it, inside Emacs only (no web search)?
 Emacs has a lot of built-in documentation; it has
  
a help system,
 an info system,
 Apropos
 all code has docstrings,
 for other outside help, it has an excellent support for the man pages with: 
 man and woman
 
  
On top of that you can install other complementary packages that add more help search features such as:
  
helpful (which is excellent)
  
There's a lot of commands available with the C-h or <f1> key prefix and lots that are not bound by default.
 I documented the ones I know and created some others in my system in this PDF: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/master/doc/pdf/help.pdf
 Despite all of that, every so often, I stumble to find the name of a function that I know exists but can't remember the name. The other day I was looking for the predicate function that tells whether point was at the beginning of line; bolp.
  
I tried typing beginning and using C-M-i to complete it. That did not work.
 I typed C-u C-h d for apropos-documentation and got a long list of suggestions from which I searched for "beginning .? line" with some regexp and finally I found bolp at line 7833 of the Apropos buffer.
  
I eventually found it, but it took longer than I like. And was very tempted to search the internet or depend on a connection to the outside world (eg, IA). But there must be a better way to quickly find functions in Emacs.
 How do *you\* quickly find the functions you need *inside Emacs*?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the best way to sync installed package versions between different computers?
 I have been using use-package with :ensure t for a long time (with the default package.el as the backend). But I've read posts from experienced Emacs users suggesting to not do this. Instead, they recommend using package-install manually and then check ~/.emacs.d/elpa into their dotfiles repo, so that you sync the exact set of installed packages between computers. This is supposed to make the config more reproducible, since after a git pull every computer will have the same "Emacs state".
 This idea appeals to me, especially since I've noticed that (i) sometimes my config doesn't bootstrap correctly on new computers, (ii) sometimes package upgrades break my setup and I want an easy way to roll everything back when I need to just get work done, and (iii) I've started relying more on GitHub packages (via package-vc-install-from-checkout) and would like to avoid having to repeat this on new hosts.
 Some more concrete questions for those who follow this approach:
  
If you sync your installed packages in this way, what exactly do you sync (i.e. what's your `.gitignore`)? 
 I guess you *should* sync the `*.el` files, otherwise there's not much point.
 I guess you *shouldn't* sync the natively compiled {`*.eln`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`} files.
 But what about the byte compiled `*.elc` files? Are these portable across different operating systems, different processor architectures, different Emacs ports, and different Emacs major versions?
 
 After syncing, do you need to do anything special to make things work? 
 For example, is `package-recompile-all` required?
 
  
Or is all this a fools errand, and I should instead switch tox e.g. elpaca, straight, etc.? Since I left Spacemacs and Doom Emacs some years ago, I've mostly stuck to the default package.el when I use Emacs (I regularly use Vim as well). But I am open to other tools if they make my life significantly easier.

One of the keys to this is that I use my Zettelkasten almost every time I have to think about some of my projects.
For example, suppose I'm having trouble developing a character's personality in a fiction story. What I do is create a structural note that aims to answer the question, "What is the ideal workflow for developing the personality of a fictional character?"

But neither it, nor any of the related replace/search commands appear to be able to find them. This only happens in this pairing scenario, where there's an underscore both at the start of the first word in a sequence, and at the end of the last word. Otherwise the underscore is found by search as it should be.
 Can anyone explain what causes that?
 FWIW, the replace/search fails regardless of whether I havecase-fold-search defaulting to t or to nil (although that does affect what message I get when the replace/search fails).
 ADDED: I've just noticed that the same problem exists with all six of the formatting characters mentioned in the manual, viz.: *, /, _, =, ~, and (if I must 🤓) + . I guess that should be a clue as to what the cause is, but I don't see it yet.

I usually can find the shells that I need but, I'd like a way to group shells / text editors / direds together according to "projects" (and have the ability to switch to buffers/shells only within that project) In addition, I'd like these projects to be permanent and restore-able. I.e. I quit emacsclient, have projects open and associated buffers (shells and text). Then the next day I can reopen emacsclient and restore the same setup. I've tried a bunch of ways to do this (projectile, project.el, perspectives, beframe, tabmode) but can't seem to be able to find a setup that ticks all the boxes above. I'm also honestly a little overwhelmed by the choices here :D Thanks for any pointers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently saw a tweet featuring an upcoming improvement to Metals that would allow you to interact with code and use completion/navigation while the project is not in a compiling state.
 This is more challenging to do than it sounds, and I wrote a tiny blurb about the problem and the proposed solution.
 TL;DR The Scala team at VirtusLab is working hard on improving the experience of using Scala 3 with Metals, but I also believe this could greatly benefit IntelliJ IDEA as well.

 I am desperately trying to get doom emacs in terminal mode (emacs -nw) to have a transparent background. I have tried everything that I could think of and find as resources, but I can only get the emacs GUI to have the transparent background by following emacs wiki and setting in my doom emacs config.el:
 (set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha-background 70) (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha-background . 70)) 
 My emacs version is emacs29-pgtk. I am using the kitty terminal and have already made the terminal itself transparent.
 I would greatly appreciate any tips on how to make this work, as I have tried for a long time and have no idea why this is not working.

I couldn't get the LABEL setting for :id to do what I expected.
 Same thing with the :match setting.
  
One cool trick--add a number of rows with a :noexport: tag and put the columnview dynamic block outside of them--made reporting a bit easier as a way to avoid including headings that aren't necessary except as property containers.
 While the above's mostly a complaint, I do have a constructive question: how can we get a cookbook of working examples that show uncommon usecases (e.g. using column view as a multi-line workaround for tables)?

and that stands even more true for Python monoliths.
Python’s versatility is convenient, yet a very big gun to shoot one’s foot with.
If there’s one thing I’ve learnt over the years of building software,
it’s the importance of testing to mitigate risks and allow refactoring in the long run.
In my experience however, I’ve seen much less testing in projects than I would’ve liked.
If it can be rarely attributed to plain malevolence or stupidity,
the most recurrent reason is: it is hard and it takes too much time.
The issue is, it’s often true!
So how can we lower the barrier to make testing easier?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a way to generate a traditional "org chart" (e.g. for a company) from an Org mode file.
 So far I've tried out org-mind-map† (via graphviz). It works, but the output is more DAG-like than the kind of thing you see with a standard organizational chart††. I know that org-mind-map-engine offers some control over the format, but none of the options match what I'm looking for.
 Does anyone know if I can get what I'm after out of org-mind-map?
 Or, if not, any other Org mode-based suggestions?
 Thanks!
  
† I'm using the-ted/org-mind-map via melpa, rather than the unpackaged fork at alphapapa/org-mind-map . That's simply because although it's a fork, the latter appears to be behind the former in commits. The forked code looks to be the unmodified v0.1 of the original, whereas the original is now at v0.4. But if anyone (e.g. u/github-alphapapa himself :-) ) thinks there's more going on there, and that the fork actually is the one to use, let me know.
 †† For example, in the traditional org. chart, a parent node with multiple child nodes would connect to its children using a single line with branches off it to each child (and the parent). Something like this. By contrast, org-mind-map's DAG-style has a separate line from the parent to child for each of the children.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using emacs & org for knowledge management, and I often need to search my notes. One of the ways I do this is with +default/org-notes-search (from search.el, maybe it's a doom thing? It just wraps ripgrep on org-directory), which displays two windows; a list of results on the bottom and a preview of the currently selected result on the top window.
 I don't hard-wrap my text files; I rely on visual-line-mode instead. This makes searching kind of annoying, because I can't get the preview window (the top one) to wrap long lines. The closest I've been able to get is by doing this:
 `(add-hook 'occur-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode)`
 which sort of enables visual-line-mode in the preview window... but only sometimes, and only if I click in that window to focus its buffer. I can then go back down to the results and flip through results in the same file, but when I Get to the next file I have to refocus the results buffer again.
 Anyone have an idea of how I can get this to work seamlessly? Extra bonus points if I can enable visual-fill-column-mode too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How can I skip certain heading levels in org clock tables? I'd like to skip certain "boring" headings from clock table reports.
 I organize my projects GTD style like this:
 * Sell My Home ** Purpose / Expected Outcome - Sell my home for a lot of money ** Project Reference - Asking price :: $100 - [[https://zillow.com][Zillow]] - [[https://realtor.com][Realtor]] ** Actions *** TODO Research Home Values :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2024-06-05 Wed 09:00]--[2024-06-05 Wed 10:00] => 0:00 :END: *** TODO Create Listing :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2024-06-05 Wed 10:00]--[2024-06-05 Wed 11:00] => 0:00 :END: 
 I use clock tables like this:
 #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope file :maxlevel 4 :compact t :block today #+CAPTION: Clock summary at [2024-06-05 Wed 11:06], for Wednesday, June 05, 2024. | Headline | Time | |----------------------------+------| | *Total time* | *2:00* | |----------------------------+------| | Sell My Home | 2:00 | | \_ Actions | 2:00 | | \_ Research Home Values | 1:00 | | \_ Create Listing | 1:00 | #+END: 
 I'd like to skip the "Actions" row, like this:
 | Headline | Time | |----------------------------+------| | *Total time* | *2:00* | |----------------------------+------| | Sell My Home | 2:00 | | \_ Research Home Values | 1:00 | | \_ Create Listing | 1:00 | 
 Is it possible to either exclude certain heading levels, or (better) exclude certain headings, but still include their children? For example, exclude "** Actions" but still include its children. I see there is a matchoption, but I'm looking for an exclude option, based on the header name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am considering to give haskell a go (again). I actually wanted to earlier but got discouraged by an (at that time) very clunky tooling experience, and I also found it annoying that I had to use pragma's to for example enable exhaustive type checking (which imo always should be default). At the time I instead decided to dive into Purescript, which I have been enjoying quite a lot ever since. I have probably written somewhere around 10k lines of purescript by now. However, I feel that purescript is quite niche and has some annoying limits due to primarily running on node or in the browser. For example, I don't see myself ever doing proper parallel processing in purescript. I also feel that purescript might be more limited in context of future job opportunities. These are the reasons for which I am considering to give learning Haskell a second try.
 Much learning material seems to be targeted at OOP programmers who are new to FP. I obviously don't need the the whole FP sales pitch with my background. What I need is more something along the lines of "I am comfortable with FP, monads, type classes and monad transformers, and now I want to learn Haskell without getting bored by the learning material".
 I have read the excellent purescript book called "Functional programming made easier" https://leanpub.com/fp-made-easier. My background before Purescript has been working professionally with F# and Clojure for a few years.
 On the longer run I am considering to do some Haskell certification https://certification.serokell.io/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm currently trying to generate MkDocs from my collection of org files, to have some sort of static documentation site based off my notes.
 My approach so far has been converting org to markdown with pandoc, to then feed all markdown files to mkdocs along with some custom css.
 This seemed quite straightforward, however I soon realised there are a few caveats: - pandoc org parsing is not 100% accurate and some elements are missing (e.g.: task priorities are not parsed to their own AST element) - mkdocs extends markdown with custom syntax, this md block for instance:  ??? Drawer Lorem Ipsum  will be rendered as a collapsible drawer in the resulting html. This led me to write some custom pandoc filters, for example to convert a :NOTES: org drawer to a ??? NOTES md block.
 In all fairness, it's becoming a bit complex and there's a lot of stuff I'm not covering yet.
 So the reason for this post is to ask you for guidance about what approach to use, I see 3 options: 1. continue with the current approach of using pandoc, adding more logic/filters when needed 2. use a different, more complete, org parser and then generate mkdocs-compatible markdown myself 3. write something entirely in Elisp, similarly to projects like ox-hugo.
 I'm a bit of an Elisp newbie, so I'm not sure how feasible it is for me to tackle option 3, other than that feel free to suggest other options.
 Thank you for taking the time to read this!

Its value is t Original value was nil If non-nil, allow editing values in *Help* buffers. To edit the value of a variable, use C-h v to display a "*Help*" buffer, move point after the text "Its value is" and type e. Values that aren’t readable by the Emacs Lisp reader can’t be edited even if this option is enabled. This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in version 29.1 of Emacs. You can customize this variable. 
 I just tried this out, and wow, is it useful. I appear to have overlooked it, and I couldn't find it mentioned on this sub yet, so...enjoy!

 However, for open-ended work, which is endemic to small companies in their high-growth and product development phase, these tools (and many, many others) fall down in a lot of ways.

 It's working pretty well with the exception of the Eldoc documentation. When I hover over something, the documentation correctly shows in the minibuffer, but when I open the Eldoc buffer with eldoc-doc-buffer, the documentation is repeated multiple times.
 I tried debugging it and found out that if I remove eglot-signature-eldoc-function from eldoc-documentation-functions, I get only one item in the Eldoc buffer. However, I don't know how to prevent Eldoc from adding this item and thus avoid the duplication in the Eldoc buffer.

 My use-case is the following: I have a video playing (web browser), and the subtitles in emacs. I can query the video for the timestamp and synchronize the subtitle to the video (moving the point to the current subtitle and potentially recentering the window).
 I want this to be done automatically until I press a key. At that point the synchronization stops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been experiencing random flickering on the pgtk build of emacs on wayland in the recent months since updating to nvidia-drivers version 535 from 525.
 I am building Emacs from source with pgtk enabled every week. And I am quite sure it is related to Nvidia because all the flickering goes away when I downgrade to nvidia-525. I am now on Nvidia 550 and the issue persists. 
 I have an RTX2060 with Gentoo.
 After some testing, I find that all OpenGL related applications especially with lower version of OpenGL like 3.x are having the same issue. I even wrote a bunch of SDL window to render simple textures to test that. All the others with vulkan does not have the same issue.
 I have messed around with Minecraft recently, and the launcher has an option of running OpenGL on Zinc, which is an OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan. If I run Minecraft with Zinc enabled, the flickering is gone.
 I believe Emacs is using OpenGL to draw on screen. Is there any workaround for me to run Emacs' OpenGL call via Zinc? Or does anyone have similar experience that have found a solution?

 pen.el was created in 2021 as an annotation tool, but I was not used it a lot at that time. Recently I picked it up and dramatically changed its usage. Now it is a complete solution of making annotations and language learning tools, right inside Emacs.
 pen relies on sqlite. All annotations are saved inside a database, which means it can be easily backup and you can read and make annotation right inside Emacs (PC/mobile) using same database.
 pen’s ideas are coming from all following great tools:
  
LingQ: Learning a language by reading
 Kindle Vocabulary Builder
 org noter
 Chatgpt
 SDCV
 go-translate
 Eudic
 蒙哥阅读器
  
and more.
 This package is mainly used along with:
  
nov-mode
 org-mode
 pdf-view-mode
 eaf-mode
  
But it is able to work with all modes in Emacs.

 It used to happen once a day but now it crashes legit every 15 minutes. Any idea what could be the problem, or has anyone experienced something similar? 
 If I had to bet I would say it's a Fedora problem, but how to know for sure? Because these crashes seem to only happen with Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I ported org-krita and org-xournalpp with custom link. They used to be based on creating their own overlay, and in my forks they are configured with `:image-data-fun` with org-mode custom links. So I commented out their minor mode definition, as they are no longer relevent; previewing images is done with `org-display-inline-images` like all other custom links.
  
https://github.com/hermanhel/org-krita (used github because I want to pull-request)
 
https://codeberg.org/Hermanhel/org-xournalpp (don't want to create gitlab account)
 
 story: 
 I was revamping on my solution to include visual illustrations in org-mode. I passed on them 2 because they were painful to use with that custom overlay, and they make huge overlays which is hard to adjust size. I used org-excalidraw for a bit, it was great, but the export tool it used excalidraw_export does not function properly at all in my KUbuntu 24.04 environment. I see the author's demo works perfectly in macOS, so maybe it is because of different svg library(excalidraw's own svg export does not display font correctly on my machine).
 I saw excalidraw use a image-data-fun, so I played around a bit and made org-krita and org-xournalpp the same. It is kind of weird that lambda do not work when I was testing, I had to declare my own functions and use function's symbol in `:image-data-fun`.
 enjoy.

 OS: Arch linux
 JDK: 21
 What I've done so far:
  
Install coursier per the website instructions
 update the JDK to version 21 of OpenJdk
 Install Metals extension with vs code.
 Create a new app using sbt sbt new scala/scala3.g8
 Open with vs code and import the sbt build for metals.
 Run metals doctor and get a bunch of warnings about version mismatches.
  
It seems like the current version of coursier ships with JDK 11 and I though it would be a good idea to update a more recent one. Seems like Metals supports up to version 21, but 17 is the current default.
 So, long story short, the environment is out of sorts. What would you all do in this situation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon, Emacsen
 I don't honestly use tree-sitter much -- my main language is well handled by the venerable vhdl-mode. However I had been using it many moons ago for a Typst document. I had all the libraries obtained, and snagged typst-ts-mode for the part where it does things with the tree-sitter output.
 I distinctly remember there being syntax coloring when I was using it before.
 I recently opened the same Typst document, and it's not doing anything with syntax highlighting. I dutifully updated Typst, the tree-sitter libraries, and typst-ts-mode and still no joy. I can turn on treesit-explore-mode and see tree-sitter correctly interpreting the code. So far, so good I guess. That's the main engine. (Also (treesit-language-available-p 'typst) returns true, so I think I'm pretty solidly in the tree-sitter active camp.)
 However I have been reading Mickey Peterson's article on tree-sitter (https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter), trying to make sure there wasn't some step I left out along the way. Also the tree-sitter Emacs documentation at https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/syntax-highlighting/. This last claims that there exists a function tree-sitter-hl-mode. I tried M-x tree-sitter- and about this time, completion offers up nothing. There are no tree-sitter functions! This is Emacs 29 and it was built with tree-sitter support so I would imagine that the basic functions would be there.
 Any ideas what went pear-shaped here? I started a ticket at typst-ts-mode's repo but I am not entirely sure if the issue is that I forgot to set something up, or if it is indeed that package.
 Thanks! I think I will remove the call to use typst-ts-mode and see if there's any difference in behavior. I THINK there's a slight snag when that buffer loads, but I'm not 100% certain just yet. (EDIT: doesn't appear to be a delay so it must have been my imagination)

 Is there a package that allows me to replace that prompt with a temporary buffer?
 What I need: - To be able to insert text efficiently with all the "normal" buffer bindings instead of the limited buffer
 What I would love: - A buffer that pops up in a posframe - When I save and quit, it has the same effect as pressing RET in the prompt - When I quit without saving it has the same effect as C-g

That said, I am trying (purely for education) to explore this problem where my functions can return values while also modifying a key data structure, so I think using the State monad makes a lot of sense. At the same time, there is a function that might or might not successfully return a value, and if it fails to return a value, then I don't want my State to be changed. From what I have read, this could be handled with a MaybeT wrapped around the State monad, but I'm struggling to work this out in my brain, and I can't find any straightforward examples.

 The initialization of the frame that displays the terminals is easy enough using something like
  (dolist (buf (buffer-list)) (with-current-buffer buf (when (eq major-mode 'term-mode) (tab-bar-new-tab) (switch-to-buffer buf)))) 
 but then such a frame should keep track of terminal buffers being killed/created and add corresponding tabs. I can probably hack my way with appropriate hooks, but I wanted to know if there's a package that already does this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am quite new to doom emacs (by new I mean like 5 months of using it) and org mode version 9.7 came out just recently, it supports pasting images from clipboard which is exactly the thing that was missing for me in emacs (yes I can use org download but it isn't as fluid). Will org mode 9.7 come to doom emacs so that running `doom sync` gets the job done or will it come in a few months and until then, just manually install the latest org mode version?

 I am working in linux mint. The stack and haskell installations are fine. Stack runs fine with the command line.
 However, I am trying to run a haskell project/script using the GUI in Intellij. In the run configurations, I am trying to create a new one using a haskell runner, but then I am not able to select my stack executable in the drop down menu. It is just blank and I cannot type the path of the executable.
 How can I fix my problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a NES emulator in Haskell, and I'm getting pretty inconsistent frame rates.
 They are consistently inconsistent in the sense that I'll have a frame run at a rate of 130 FPS, and the next one at a rate of 30 FPS, followed by another frame at 130 and so on. 
 If I run with +RTS - p -RTS, I can get a center cost that tells me which functions take the longest.
 But I'm not interested in the mean cost of each function, but rather in the variance.
 Is there any way to profile this automatically? I would really prefer not to wrap every function I have in a timer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that Emacs is more than an editor. You can spend an entire life learning Emacs. It never stops and it adapts to anything you want to do with a computer. 
 Using one, or several terminal emulator buffers inside Emacs can be extremely useful. What's you use case?
 As for me, one thing I do often is create a keyboard macro that gathers information from one or several shell or REPL output to place it inside text file either for documentation or to create unit-test code. And sometimes I write some elisp code to do some of that. Being able to interact with an Erlang and Python REPL for example, with the OS shell of a local or remote computer and Emacs Lisp together (including with eshell) greatly enhance what can be done quickly. 
 Not all Emacs terminal emulators are made equal. I wrote a comparison table for the ones I know and what I have tested. That might be useful for others. It's here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/master/doc/pdf/shells-comparison.pdf 
  
This is part of a larger set, the index is accessible in the top-left corner. Use a browser that can render PDF directly instead of downloading the PDF for a better experience.
  
What are *your* use cases?

 You can upgrade from GNU ELPA or install with M-x package-install RET org RET
 Please, also re-install all the Org-related packages - some of the changes require re-compiling packages that use Org mode APIs.
 Release notes: https://orgmode.org/Changes.html
 Announcement: https://list.orgmode.org/87jzj7adfd.fsf@localhost/T/#u
 If you enjoy using Org, please consider supporting contributors via https://liberapay.com/org-mode/. Donations do help a lot.
 Some highlights of user-facing additions
  
Org mode supports drag-and-drop and pasting images/files from clipboard (pasting from clipboard requires Emacs >=29)
 Thanks to Visuwesh for contributing these features.

 I am trying to learn Lisp, and since most of the tutorials seem to use Emacs, I am learning Emacs at the same time. 
 Now, I have a 60% keyboard, and I was wondering whether I should move to a full-sized keyboard to use Emacs more easily?
 for example, the very first example in the Portacle tutorial requires typing ~ three times, which on a 60% keyboard is Fn-S-~ , so it is a bit of gymnastics. (Portacle is a packaged installation of Common Lisp with Emacs) 
 Thank you for any advice

 There are different oppinions about solving algorithmic problems during hiring process. Not a big fan of it, but I still see that employers include coding tasks in such platforms. My recently I was asked to pass task in HackerRank and Codility. For another interview Codewars was recommended for preparation. I quite enjoyed https://www.codewars.com I must say (not a promotion btw just sharing personal impression), however it does not have a lot of Scala tasks.
 I assume 90% of that market is occupied by Leetcode, but still curious whether you are practising solving such small coding tasks and if so, on which platform? 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I would appreciate some thoughts/opinions on this. 
 Preface: In my day to day work I am Java Dev using hibernate. I resented it at first (too much magic), but it kind of grew on me and I recently started to really appreciate it mainly in the following sense: When modeling my domain I can go full java-first, completely ignoring that my model is backed by a RDBMS, that is - code my model as if there were no DB, slap the right annotations on it, (make a few compromises here and there) and get going. It even forward engineers the ddl for me.
 So in scala world it seems to me that the accepted approach is to separate the model from the persistent model? 
 Here is why I think that: - the libraries I found map rows to case classes, but usually no built in support for inheritance, sealed trait hierachies, ... - no support for one to many aggregation - bad support for nested case class, especially if they occur multiple times
 Here is a sample of how I would model an invoice if there were no database
 scala case class Invoice( ... senderName: String, senderAddress: Address, // general purpose case class to not repeat myself recipientName: String, recipientAddress: Address, status: Status, // some sealed trait with cases like e.g. case Sent(when: LocalDate) positions: List[InvoicePosition] ... ) 
 I feel like I either - have to compromise A LOT in modeling my domain if I want to close to zero hassle with db libs out there - have my db access case classes be separated from the domain and do alot of mapping/transforming
 Any experiences, or hints? how do you handle this in your apps

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I'm not too experienced with Emacs-fu, but I think I might be developing a case of Emacs pinky. I've tried making some changes—I've adopted evil, god-mode, and I'm planning to buy a split keyboard this year.
 The main issue I'm facing is inefficient mini-buffer navigation. For instance, I use WSL, so there are a lot of nested folders I have to navigate through, which means I end up hitting TAB a lot, and it's painful.
 My current workflow looks something like this: C-x C-f ~/fol TAB (folder1) TAB nes er2 TAB (nested-folder2), and so on.
 For completion, I used Helm in the past. I use Vertico now because I believe I'll be able to master it sooner than Helm. I feel it's more predictable with more information available online on how to set it up. However, I liked how Helm handles completion with the RET flow instead of TAB unlike Vertico which opens Dired on RET. 
 Now, I have a few questions:
  
Is there a better way to navigate mini-buffer completions? 
 Is there a better way to navigate through nested folders efficiently?
 
 How can I mimic Helm-like completion behavior in Vertico?
 How do I turn off TAB completion so that I don't keep clicking out of habit, like I do with Capslock?
  
Thanks!

 Additionally, totally disabling standard org fontification (bold, italics, underline) in example blocks would be helpful, if anyone has any insight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm experimenting with composition-function-tableto add effects to certain sequences of characters, like shoving to characters closer together. I noticed that characters with descenders that extend below the baseline like "g", "j", and "y" can cause the line height to increase when rendered via `font-shape-string` via a custom entry in `composition-function-table`. This happens for example with the "M+ Code Latin 50" font, but only at certain font heights.
 The simplest reproduction is this:
 (set-char-table-range composition-function-table t '(["g" 0 font-shape-gstring])) 
 That causes this artifact, where typing a "g" causes the next line to shift downwards:
 https://cdn.zappy.app/801ae7a7b03d568b3b80500b04047054.gif
 It works fine (no line shifting) stock, but when I add an entry to `composition-function-table` the weirdness starts happening.
 I tried messing with the font in FontLab. I can fix the problem by increasing the Units per eM value, which causes the font to get smaller. I then increase the font height in Emacs to compensate. That works, but it's an odd thing to do, and I have to make the font height pretty large to get a normal-looking actual height. Other options in FontLab like increasing the line gap, safe descender value, etc didn't help.
 I'd like to understand why this is happening.
 EDIT: ";" (semicolon) is a more realistic example. I'm trying to create a ligature that will push ";;" closer together, for Lisp comments. However the semicolon in my font has a descender that extends below the baseline, causing the same line shifting effect as shown with the "g" above, when I try to use a ";;" ligature.

Are there any packages (or tools that play nice with ansi-term) that I could install to achieve btop level functionality? For instance, network and disk usage, better procedure grouping, etc?

 Is there anything I can do to make the titlebar have the normal color?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To understand ghc's package management better, I decided to manually install vector package and see if it gets picked up by hls and if the final program compiles.
 I went to the vector package on hackage, saw it had two dependencies, vector-stream and primitive. I downloaded vector, vector-stream and primitive using the commands,
 cabal get primitive cabal get vector-stream cabal get vector 
 then first I compiled the dependencies primitive and vector-stream, using cabal build. That gave dist-newstyle directory.
 Inside dist-newstyle\packagedb\ghc-9.8.2 there was a .conf file, I edited it to point all the file references to the ghc package database which is ghcup\ghc\9.8.2\lib\x86_64-windows-ghc-9.8.2.
 I placed the entire downloaded package directory (eg vector-stream-0.1.0.1) inside ghcup\ghc\9.8.2\lib\x86_64-windows-ghc-9.8.2.
 Then I registered the package with
 ghc-pkg register <file>.conf 
 After performing above steps for primitive, vector-stream and vector respectively, vector was now being picked up by hls. GHC also compiles and links fine.
 Did I do it correctly? Will there be any issues in the future?
 I know this is not the preferred way at all, and you should be using cabal which streamlines this process. Vector had just 2 dependencies which already comes with base so it wasn't much of a hassle. This only for learning purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I don't know if this is the correct place to post this kind of question.
 Recently a colleague of mine introduced me to the wonders of Scala, which I ignored for years thinking that's just a "dead language" that's been surpassed by other languages.
 I've been doing some research and I was wondering why someone should start a new project in Scala when there ares new language which have a good concurrency (like Go) or excellent performance (like Rust).
 Since I'm new in Scala I was wondering if you guys could help me understand why I should use Scala instead of other good languages like Go/Rust or NodeJS.
 Thanks in advance!
