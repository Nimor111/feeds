        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Emacs 27, and I'm using packages to load packages and customize to configure. How do I set up init.el so that Emacs will load a theme that is needed first, but then configure properly afterward?
 My example: Starting from scratch, I want to load monokai-theme from melpa and set it:
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t) (custom-set-variables '(custom-enabled-themes '(monokai)) '(custom-safe-themes '("d9646b131c4aa37f01f909fbdd5a9099389518eb68f25277ed19ba99adeb7279" default)) '(package-selected-packages '(monokai-theme))) (custom-set-faces ) 
 If monokai-theme is already downloaded, this works fine. But I want to have emacs download the package automatically if not already present. I use the following block:
 (when (not package-archive-contents) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install-selected-packages) ) 
 If I add this below the customize variables, it installs monokai-theme but doesn't load it. I need to restart emacs. If I add this above the customize variables, it doesn't work because package-selected-packages is not loaded yet.
 There's a catch-22 here since each piece needs the other to run first.
 I want to see if I can configure most things in customize, but maybe customize is not right for this job? Should I be using customize at all?

        <link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/ru8uy0/iron_v120_is_out_happy_new_year/"/>
        <updated>2022-01-02T12:40:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.2.0.
 What is Iron ?
 Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.
 Here is a simple example: ```scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.log)
 log(-1d) //Compile-time error ```
 Features of 1.2.0
 Release 1.2.0 brings two key features: an imperative-styled DSL and constraints relations/consequences.
 Imperative DSL
 Iron brings a new imperative-styled DSL directly inspired by Martin Odersky's Representing Monad with Capabilities (HOPE 2021).
 Here is the "imperative" form of our log(x) method presented above: scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Raw[Double] = refined { Math.log(x) }  In this example, x is automatically unboxed via an implicit conversion only available inside refined and Math.log(x) is automatically boxed into a new Constrained.
 Capabilities work for other kind of monads. If you want to use capabilities in your project, I highly suggest you to watch the talk linked above.
 Consequences
 A consequence has basically a definition analoguous to logical implication => (do not confuse it with Scala's functions). It is used to convert a Constrained value to another Constrained.
 While a default implementation exists for all conversions, this new typeclass allows you to define specific relations (like transitivity, reflexivity etc...) that have two major benefits: - Check some conversions at compile-time where (for example, we know that a constrained value A / B can't be converted to A / Not[B]). - Avoid unnecessary evaluations at runtime.
 Note that Consequences are not exclusive to mathematical/numerical values.
 That's all for this release. For further information, check the release on Github.
 Happy new year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Typeclassopedia mentions that Monad is more powerful than Applicative. Is there a cs-theoretic concept that corresponds to that / defines what "power" means in this context?
 Here is the quote from Typeclassopedia:
  
Intuitively, it is this ability to use the output from previous computations to decide what computations to run next that makes Monad more powerful than Applicative

 In my previous GNU/Linux distribution I was using Emacs 28 but in the package repos of my current one (Void Linux), Emacs 28 is not there (https://voidlinux.org/packages/?arch=x86_64&q=emacs).
 I miss some of its features. That's why I would like to compile it from source. I know a lot of you guys do this: which is your criteria to chose a branch or tag from which to compile, from the Emacs repo? (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/tree/master)
 I want to use the latest more or less stable version possible, not the most bleeding edge one possible. Since I don't want to potentially run into errors on a daily basis or anything like that.
 Should I go for the latest tag possible, i.e. emacs-28.0.90? If I understand correctly, tags are meant to indicate each latest stable version, don't they? Or should I go for the HEAD of any specific branch?
 Thanks a lot in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things that amazes me about Haskell is the rabbit holes I'm ceaselessly cascading down. For example, what I thought was an innocent question turned out to be my latest rabbit hole, i.e. apparently Haskell doesn't have real recursive types. Apparently, what I thought was a recursive type, e.g.
 data Peano = Zero | Succ Peano 
 is not really a recursive type, although I'm not sure why. My previous question about what turned out to be the omega combinator brought up the true nature of Haskell recursive types and the mysterious newtype "workaround". So this talks about a real natural number recursive type (as does my previous question)
 MyNat = One :+: MyNat 
 MyList a = One :+: (a :*: MyList a)
 I can't truly fathom what's being done/said here, e.g., no idea what is meant first paragraph in by a typed tagless-final interpreter. Simple blind acceptance, which is just hand-waving, isn't my style. And the logic programming course it references is, well, my latest rabbit hole. Can somebody give me some intro material to this whole issue of what really is a recursive type. This all started, BTW, with trying to understand what a type equation meant. Can you guess how many pdfs and web pages I've opened since then? Fazit: Somebody (me?) needs to pull all these threads together into one big Haskell-Omni textbook. The existing beginner texts are too handwavy, IMHO. There's a kiddie version of Haskell and a grownup's version. The kiddie version is pretty much useless, again, IMHO, unless it's to spur you on to the bigger stuff.

 This just cost me fiveten minutes of my life (only because I have gotten used to it, having been broken multiple times now from main branch renames in various projects).
 I am here to complain and perhaps save some time for anyone else who contributes to Org mode or uses the source occasionally.

I am not an expert in any of those languages, however, I am really liking functional programming with Haskell. I am even learning how to do FP in c++. My question is for people that are more experienced with Haskell. Will I suffer trying to do what co-workers do with c++, in Haskell? Mind you, the majority of what we do is security related (RE, exploit dev, secure systems, etc)

 (λx . xx)(λx . xx) 
 and this form
 (λx . xxx)(λx . xxx)(λx . xxx) 
 How could they be done as Haskell anonymous functions? I've got this in a similar vein perhaps
 let x = a in let y = λz.x in let x = b in y x 
 But I've mixed in the parts I can't fathom in Haskell, i.e., the λz.x and y x This isn't it (\x -> \x -> x)
 which is, if I'm not mistaken (λxx . x); it just takes two inputs and returns the second; and this doesn't seem to be allowed (\x -> x x) so I'm stuck.

Semantically this makes perfect sense; it is exactly what I want to do. However, my agenda for the day doesn't distinguish between the two, so it can be confusing when I look for my daily TODO items. Is there a trick to getting the scheduled and deadline agenda entries to display differently on today's agenda, or should a feature request be made?

 Is there any way to use global-prettify-symbols-mode and not have it change all TODO keywords to checkboxes? When marked as DONE, the checkboxes turn into a 'ticked' checkbox that I find very ugly. I am wondering if there is some variable I can set in the init which will get rid of this substitution while keeping the global mode on, as I do prettify a lot of other things.

 Between clangd and ccls I can't really decide which would be better for me? Most of the threads I've seen discussing the two are years old.

 Which do you all prefer and why? Thanks!

 Take a look at this screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/tzcDdYKl.png Line 10 is the last line of the buffer. There is nothing after Line 10. The fringe bitmap indicator shows the void (limbo?) after the end of the buffer. But the doc refers to this void (limbo lines) as "empty lines". Why?
 Aren't Lines 6-10 empty lines? Lines 6-10 are actual lines that contain nothing but \n. Aren't these the empty lines - the blank lines?
 Isn't everything after Line 10 limbo? visual representation of lines that don't exist / end of buffer? Help me understand the Emacs terminology? Why lines that don't exist are called "empty lines"?

In the same hour I thrown off everything about who did it and where to find tips and solutions (actually, I even doesn't remember if I had this information) and took it apart without trying to remember. Then I waited for some time to forget everything and then I found that this puzzle is a bit more complex than I thought about it.
 So I decided to write some code (surely using Haskell) to solve it. And today I did it.
 Here is repository:

 But I have a question: is it possible to make it faster and not using so much memory?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for the wall of text, but I've been reading a lot of guides and not really getting the answer I need. If anyone wants to help a complete newcomer, I could really use it.
 I've read some monad tutorials/lectures and I think I have a beginner's understanding. Basically what I took away was "without unsafePerformIO, which you should not use, Monad types like M a can't be converted to a. Instead you compose your Monad functions with pure functions using operators like <$> or >>=." I also think I understand this distinction between "pure" and "monad" functions helps the haskell compiler be extremely cool.
 That sounds really good, but I'm having trouble understanding how to structure an application around this. I'm trying to teach myself Haskell by writing an interactive fiction game. So far I have an RPG-style dice roller written, but it's deterministic. I'm creating a seed from the system time inside of a do, using the <- operator. I then use (basically) randomRs (_,_) (mkStdGen seed). Because I used do and I wasn't sure what to do after that though, so I tried using unsafePerformIO and I'm almost certain this is why my dice roller rolls the same numbers every time.
 Do I have to make all my roll-processing functions and the entire skill system speak IO Int and pass up and down an updated stdGen? I am pretty sure the answer is "no," since I can use bind to invoke pure functions. But if that's true, I'm not sure how to apply that while designing a whole application.
 I guess what I'm unsure of is how to structure something larger than a few functions around all of this. Does anyone have any favorite guides or wisdom about the big-picture structure of an application written in Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on a Mac (El Capitan). With a little recent help from the emacs.stackexchange.com forum participants, I have written up a few Emacs functions to refresh the TD Ameritrade access token for its API, and to submit custom buy/sell orders for equities (although it could be for options trading too, but that's not my cup of tea). At some point in the future, I hope to write Lisp code to stream TDA data using the API and make trading decisions from within Emacs. For the near foreseeable future, however, I'll be relying upon watching the Thinkorswim desktop application to make decisions to buy/sell. Screen real estate is precious, as I need to see the charts, studies, order flow, etc.
 In a nutshell, I only need to tell Emacs: 50.35 RET and then perhaps 15 seconds later 51.25 RET. I have installed KeyboardMaestro, for systemwide keyboard shortcuts offering a variety of options, including executing scripts and so forth.
 I have two (2) Emacs options for order submission, either calling the curl executable, or running url-retrieve-synchronously.
 Any ideas regarding how to do this Emacs order entry quickly and save screen real estate would be greatly appreciated.
 BACKGROUND: There are certain custom orders available through TDA that cannot be executed programmatically from within Thinkorswim, but that should be possible through the API. Speed is the key as I am interested in momentum trades with high volatility.

 I'm using the Emacs packages simpleclip to copy to clipboard, and shell-pop to open up a terminal in Emacs quickly with a keybinding.
 Anyways, I can copy text from the terminal to the clipboard, but whenever I try to past into the terminal, it throws the error:
 ​
 `Buffer is read-only: #<buffer \*ansi-term-1\*>`
 ​
 So how do I fix this issue? I use the emacs package use-package in my .emacs config, so I'm trying to figure out what lisp code is required to fix this issue, so that I can paste into the terminal in emacs.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for the help!

 I've updated the example. It now uses nix flakes. The elisp files can be maintained as a dirty tree for happy hacking. Home manager is mainly used for the static aspects of user home integration rather than installing the elisp files read-only. I will be installing this on a Darwin machine sometime today.
 The Scheme
  
Straight for elisp packages & lockfiles
 Home manager for dotfiles
 Nix expressions for distributing 3rd party deps
  
Forewarning, the Emacs lisp is not marketed as good. At anything. My git tree is dirty. I mainly use the vterm integration and Rust Analyzer.
 The Future
  
Emacs can maintain its own nix profile to have a self-contained set of 3rd party dependencies like language servers and dynamic modules independently of the user environment
 Emacs can generate a home manager module for programs like vterm that want home integration
 Emacs can maintain non-package elisp configuration expressions without resorting to rigid git managed structures or rapidly decaying patchworks lifted from literate org files scattered around
  
The mix of tooling is the main work output of this project so far. Appreciate pointing out any work related to the Future

 I'm an undergrad student very interested in Haskell and functional programming in general. Doing some stuff in my spare time, however, isn't quite satisfying and I want to learn more, especially how it would look to write actual production Haskell. 
 That is why I would like to apply for an internship or job in Haskell. But here comes the problem: 
 All job offers for Haskell programmers either require years of experience with Haskell in production and/or a PhD. 
 I think this is a problem because: 
  
If nobody offers a job for beginners to work with Haskell, how does the community want to get new people who have worked years in Haskell that don't come from academia?

You don't need to install any external packages, just compile the newest source code of Emacs (at least newer than this commit by Po Lu) with "--with-pgtk" together with "--with-xwidgets" flags. Then M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url and enter a url, you could surf the Internet via Emacs!
 For people not familiar to this: pgtk port is the feature Emacs use pure GTK, which means it could run under pure Wayland. Xwidgets is a feature that allows Emacs to display GTK and NS widgets inside buffers. Xwidgets doesn't support pgtk before, Po Lu made it support pgtk.

 Writing a shell script, Emacs adds 4 tabs and 1 space. I don’t want this to happen. I want Emacs to go to the first character in the previous line. Emacs is going wild with auto-formatting. I want electricity. I like electricity. But I don’t like auto-formatting. That is, I don’t like tons of random tabs and spaces added for no reason.
 for in i in 1 2 <tab><tab><tab><tab><space><cursor is now here> 
 I don’t want that. I want :
 for in i 1 2 <cursor is here> 
 M-x electric-indent-mode doesn’t work, because then I lose electricity, which is also problematic. I like electricity, but I don’t like auto-formatting. Turning off electricity isn’t good:
 for in i 1 2 do <cursor is here> 
 I want the cursor to be aligned with the do, not at the beginning of the line. Does anyone know how to do this?

 What a wonderful gift to the emacs community to end out a difficult (I would say horrible) year and end it with hope and optimism going into 2022.

 It works well but I recently found out that the default indentation is only 2 space char. I would like to have it inserting 4 chars width TABS. I tried to look in the customization group of indent.el and even used kernel coding style emacs config, which works when I press <TAB> but doesn't when using (indent-buffer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellow 'macsers,
 TL;DR: Can you tell me which function emacs invokes to ask for auth data?
 I recently heard of mini-frame-mode and fell in love. While I see the need to have a vertical display for functions and variable descriptions (marginalia ftw!), I have always been irritated by a new buffer appearing "out of nowhere" on the bottom of my screen, moving the modeline etc.
 So, I have adjusted the looks of mini-frame-mode to my liking. Now, there is one piece missing: whenever I push to my git repository, mini-frame-mode opens to prompt me for my git auth data. I don't want mini-frame-mode to handle this; instead, I want the password prompt to appear in the original mini buffer on the bottom.
 I know of the mini-frame-ignore-commands variable. However, I don't know which program is evoked by emacs to ask me for the password. I tried skimming the Messages Buffer for it, but adding magit-process-username-prompt and magit-process-password-prompt to the list didn't change anything, and I was unable to find a reference to another function in the packages' code.
 Thus: can you tell me which function emacs invokes to ask for auth data?
 Have a good day, folks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have observed some strange GHC behavior while working on my $DAYJOB project that I'd like to report as an issue on the GHC bug tracker. To do so, I intend to prepare a minimal case that reproduces the issue on the compiler version that the GHC developers would most prefer. I'm having trouble doing that though:
 1) Which is the GHC version that would be the most useful for GHC developers? 8.10.7, the one the majority of the users currently use (me included)? 9.2.1 which is the latest stable release? Or GHC HEAD? 
 2) Unless the answer to (1) above is GHC 8.10.7, what's the easiest way to obtain that GHC version, very preferably without polluting my system globally? I've built GHC HEAD using the great nix-shell provided by https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix, which allowed me to build it without installing any system dependencies globally. But I can't figure out how to run the resulting GHC, I have ./inplace/bin/runghc which I can use to interpret .hs files and I have ./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2, but that one results in a billion linker errors when I try to compile anything. I've also tried installing GHC versions via ghcup, but that one also fails because I think I'm supposed to install some system dependencies, but I really don't like doing that if at all possible.
 It might be a good idea to update the report a bug page in the GHC wiki with this information. This subreddit is probably not the best place to ask these questions, but I'm also not sure where best to engage with the GHC developers.
 Thanks for any pointers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While trying to make the switch back to emacs from vscode. I have this issue. I've created my own colorschemes in vscode with customized fonts per language tokens. 
 Where i can easily adjust font size, colors, or any attributes for tokens in a .json file, and by inspecting tokens in the editor with (Ctrl+Shift+P) (for Editor Tokens and Scopes in the Command Palette). I can specify in the json for any token category in the textmate grammar any font size, color, attribute etc.....
 Can the same be accomplished in emacs, and what resources/links should I be looking at to work on porting over my colorscheme for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello haskellers,
 I know this question has been asked in the past, but I'm hoping to get a more modern answer :')
 Are there any recommended resources for learning category theory and haskell?
 Some background info, I have a math undergrad degree, and I had fun with the pure math, proofs, theorems, etc. so I'd love to dive deeper into the formal math behind category theory.
 After graduating, I've had a few different roles before landing a software engineer position about 6 months ago... mainly working with JavaScript/TypeScript/node.js.
 I've also worked through the JavaScript Mostly Adequate Guide to FP, which further piqued my interest in FP, also learned some basic Clojure and used it for Advent of Code this year.
 Has anyone worked through the MIT course, Programming with Categories? Does this seem like a good place to start? Leafing through the textbook, it seems to strike a good balance between the formal math and introducing haskell basics. I was thinking of working through it, then work through a more in-depth haskell resource after (i.e. learn you a haskell or something).
 What did you use to learn category theory and/or haskell?
 Thanks in advance for your input!

There are 4 different labs in Go lang I plan to redo in Scala (MapReduce, Raft, Fault-tolerant Key/Value Service, Sharded Key/Value Service). There is also a bunch of lectures available on YouTube: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html. I would like to know if there is any interest in forming a study group to motivate each other to complete this course and work on the labs together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on my "adulting." I'm reviewing and setting habits to help guide me in times of lower clarity. Looking at ideas for creating a tool for thinking, I came up with a tool that prompts me to refine the edits to zettel titles and 'summary relevance.'
This 'tool for thinking' results from a python program tied to Keyboard Maestro that prompts me to review titles and summaries of the last ten days of newly created zettel. As an anchor, it is tied to my practice of morning journaling. It reminds me and makes it convenient to examine each zettel title and the one-sentence 'relevance' statement to see if it makes sense and stands up to scrutiny. This is added to the bottom of that template. (pictured below) Automatic, easy peasy, the cognitive load of the initiating behavior habit off-loaded to the computer. This is not an excuse for not editing the body of each zettel. A new zettel will be on the list for ten days. That means ten opportunities for giving the zettel some love.
I'm unsettled on the format. In its current form it is a bit hard to read. I will make changes for readability.
If you're interested in how this is done, have questions about my use-case, or just want to chat let me know.
Below are pictured titles and a one-sentence summary/meaning of the zettel I'm working on. These are the ideas I'm currently wrestling with. They represent a ten-day window of new zettel.
This is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list. If any of this is of interest to you, please start a thread here, DM me, or get in touch via email.]]></summary>

Start pen, open a text file, python, elisp, etc. and run lsp. Anyway, I'm going to continue working on this into next year.

 I use straight.el to manage packages. I also use use-package for configuration. I have use-package configured to use straight.el. I'm using the development version org-mode, which was fantastic, until Emacs 28 started shipping with v9.5, which is all I need. The built-in version seems to load much quicker than the one I have. (I'm not byte compiling my init files; maybe I should do that?) Is there a way to make use-package use the built-in version of org-mode even though I've got straight-use-package-by-default set to t?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When creating tasks using org-capture, I try to provide as much context as i can, so it might take 2-3 mins to create one task. this would make my agenda look messy because of these tasks with short clocked time. 
 ​
 I wonder if there's an easy way to create a function/hook that removes the clock drawer if the clocked minute is less than a threshold, say 5 mins?
 ​
 There is something similar in org-mode already, when the variable org-clock-out-remove-zero-time-clocks is set to true, empty clock drawers are removed after org-clock-out.

 Also I can see the lag while switching buffers and in execution while using spacemacs.

Highlight syntax is okay inside the block but when I execute with C - c C - c I get this: "No org babel execute function for sclang". Sclang seems to be supported by Babel and Org (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html) but since it was working there is no doubt sclang is supported anyways. I am also ensuring that a working installation of sclang is functional and on when executing the block. 
 I am also setting it to (require 'sclang) before anything, so cannot think anything else. Executable of the lang is declared as well and functioning okay! 
 All in all, the language is working in its mode so there is nothing else that points a reason to investigate and also when trying other languages in such as js it works okay with results appearing as expected outside the source block.
 #+begin_src js console.log("hello") #+end_src #+RESULTS: : hello : undefined 
 I have activated sclang using this below:
 (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((sclang . t)))

 I wanted to reach out to the reddit community about haskell salaries. The only other reddit thread on the topic I could find was from 8 years ago, so I was curious if things have changed in the past 8 years.
 According to the Stack Overflow 2021 Developer Survey, Haskell developers seem to make much less than some other "functional" languages (i.e. Clojure, F#, Elixir). Do you find this to be true in your experience?
 I'd also be interested to hear about haskell salaries in the US vs elsewhere.
 If you would like, feel free to share your salary here (for others to reference), but no pressure!
 Thanks in advance!

 Is anyone else seeing this?

 What if I have one export back-end for this card and another back-end for a mermaid.js export, how can I mix both back-ends as both change the same function? Can't I just extend the html backend with more functions for other special blocks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've started a translation from Common Lisp to Scala of Forbus and de Kleer's tools from their Building Problem Solvers. At this point I have working versions of two of the more useful of their tools, the justification- and assumption-based truth maintenance systems (JTMS and ATMS).
 Truth maintenance systems track the relationships among possible beliefs, reasoning rules, incompatible/contradictory beliefs, and the conclusions we might draw from them. The JTMS stores a single context of which beliefs we might adopt; the ATMS tracks all of the various environments which might support the possible beliefs without contradiction. TMSes can guide search in reasoning engines, or can directly serve as models for program domains.
 The JTMS and ATMS code here are simple translations of F&dK's implementation, translated with minimal changes into Scala. Part of my motivation is to have a deeper look at their code, and I'll likely add documentation in the next few weeks, and possibly additional tool translations.
 On Scaladex or Github. Enjoy.

 Here it is the custom type link. :)

For those familiar with, I'm basically trying to replicate Sublime Text's functionality when you Ctrl/Cmd-D over any string.
 iedit documentation mentions that "Many other work flows to highlight occurrences are possible, for example, (...) incremental selection", which sounds exactly like what I want. But looking through the documentation, available functions, and even the source code, I couldn't find the answer.

 I've just published a new Blog Post on a classic implementation technique for lazy functional programming: combinatory logic based graph-reduction engine.
 The implementation is structured into three parts:
  
A λ-calculus parser from A Combinatory Compiler which was extended to cover a tiny functional language based on the untyped λ-calculus.
 A compiler from λ-calculus to combinatory logic combinators (S,K,I,B,C and Y) which is based on bracket-abstraction and some optimization rules.
 A graph-reducer. Combinator terms are allocated into a graph data-structure. Which is then reduced by applying combinator graph-reduction. The destructive inplace reduction of the graph is made possible by using STRef
 mutable references.

 TLDR: how to count tags in a buffer and put them in a matrix where each cell counts the co-occurrences of both tags in a heading?
 The long story: thematic analysis is a quite common technique used to synthesize meaning in texts (those interested in a brief but good introduction, please peek https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/thematic-analysis/). In short, once done each idea in a text is marked by a tag, and then you can synthesize a text by it's tags (of course, we can also group them, but that comes after) and different texts can be compared by it's found tags.
 As we all know, emacs is a great operating system and comes not only with org-mode but also with a decent editor ;) so it was a logical idea to use both to do thematic analysis. And in the end, it seems t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In css-mode, if I enable hs-minor-mode and start folding blocks with hs-toggle-hiding, I cannot unfold it with hs-toggle-hiding again. I can reproduce this in emacs -Q, just try folding this in css-mode with hs-toggle-hiding (after turning on hs-minor-mode):
 p { margin: 1rem 0; } 
 For reference, this is the definition of hs-toggle-hiding:
 (defun hs-toggle-hiding (&optional e) "Toggle hiding/showing of a block. See `hs-hide-block' and `hs-show-block'. Argument E should be the event that triggered this action." (interactive) (hs-life-goes-on (posn-set-point (event-end e)) (if (hs-already-hidden-p) (hs-show-block) (hs-hide-block)))) 
 This is happening because for some reason (posn-set-point (event-end nil)) (as e is nil when hs-toggle-hiding is run as a command) would move point to somewhere that makes hs-already-hidden-p always return nil.
 Currently I'm patching the function in my config by only running posn-set-point if e is non-nil:
 (when e (posn-set-point (event-end e))) 
 which fixes it.
  
I can't imagine I'm the only person who has encountered this issue. Is this a known issue and has it perhaps been fixed in Emacs 28?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, as a means to learn Haskell I've decided to write a very basic Web3 implementation in it, everything has been great so far but I'm having a really hard time trying to encode integers that are greater than 8 bytes because of the data types. I've come across some useful libraries but settled on using Data.Binary. Here's an example of something I want to do in Elixir:
 ```elixir
 This just gives you a 32 bytes representation of that number
 <<3214000000000000000000::signed-256>>
  
<<0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 174, 59,
  
53, 195, 127, 137, 120, 0, 0>>
 ```
 On Haskell I've tried and it works with smaller numbers (Whatever fits into Int64), but with bigger ones:
 ```haskell
 B64.encode $ BL.toStrict $ runPut $ putInt64be 3214000000000000000000
 <interactive>:61:48: warning: [-Woverflowed-literals]
 Literal 3214000000000000000000 is out of the Int range -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807
 "AAB4iX/DNTs="
 ```
 Which does not give me the correct representation since the value is out of bounds (I think the number it sticks with is 4266531174538018816 (maxBound :: Int64) rather than the one I passed)
 ​
 So, I wanted to ask, what are my options to encode these numbers in the same way I can do on the first Elixir example? Is there a technique I'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last five years it was twice that I had to figure out how parse JSON in streaming fashion. I figured that I release a library, so I don't have to figure it out again some years in the future. I suspect this library might be useful to others too, since it is likely that I am not the only who ran into such problem. In my particular situation use cases were:
  
Parse a very large JSON file, contents of which was one very big top level dictionary with millions of key value pairs. My requirement was that I needed to modify each individual key/value pair without affecting memory overheaad.
 Continuously parse an infinite stream of log entries from a service called logentries.com where each entry was formatted as JSON and delimited by a newline.
  
conduit-aeson is capable of handling both of these use cases and probably others as well. See haddock for examples and documentation. Here is one such example:
 ```
  
  
:set -XOverloadedStrings :set -XTypeApplications import Conduit let input = "{ \"foo\": 1, \"bar\": 2, \"baz\": 3 }" runConduit $ yield input .| conduitObject @String @Int .| printC ("foo",1) ("bar",2) ("baz",3) ```

 In TiddlyWiki I can automatically query and format many information throughout the Wiki. Easy tasks like displaying a table of all D&D sessions is achievable with the column mode, but how about more complex aggreagations? For my studies, I created tiddlers for every subject including information for CP, semester, and category. In my overview, each semester is listed as seperate heading with the subjects being displayed by category as description lists and the CP summed up for each category. Please refer to the screenshot.
 In TiddlyWiki I can use filter expressions to select any tiddler (entry) from the wiki and extract data from it. This data can be transformed into arbitrary HTML, which is rendered when the article is visited. This query and transformation is done in the Wiki's own syntax, which is a part of the reason I wanted to switch to Emacs.
 How would I recreate this in OrgMode? I'm okay with having all information in one file and don't mind to learn elisp. What I would like to have is the information to be displayed inline (not in another buffer) and being able to use all or most of OrgModes usual formatting options.

 One important step for me is to replicate the Spyder Dark Theme within Emacs (because I like it, am used to it and am not really satisfied with other ones I tried so far). What I have, is the spec of the theme that you can see in the screenshot attached.
 Unfortunately now I am really stuck in how to proceed to convert those hex colors to an emacs custom theme, as a complete emacs newbie... Any help would be much appreciated!
 ​
 Have a nice holiday season!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if this is something that's okay to post here, but I figure I'll give it a shot. I wrote this C++ Yasnippet script a few months ago, and I use it basically every day.
 # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: function # key: fn # contributor: conscat # -- ${3:$(map-void yas-text "void " "auto ")}${1:name}($2)${3:$(map-void yas-text "" " -> ")}$3 { $0 } 
 The most interesting part is map-void, which I define like this:
 (defun map-void (check replace-t replace-f) (interactive) (if (string= check "") replace-t replace-f)) 
 Here's what it does:
 I type fn, then press TAB. That expands into this (white space a little different). The | represents my cursor:
 void |func() {}
 I can type in a function name here. I press TAB again:
 void foo(|) {}
 Now I can type in a parameter list, and TAB again:
 void foo(int moo)| {}
 Now here's the cool part. If I type in anything, a -> is automatically inserted, and the void at the front becomes auto!
 auto foo(int moo) -> boo|{}
 And then I TAB into the body of my function and type the rest. I know it's not that crazy, but it's the ability to just do these kind of neat hacks that makes me appreciate Emacs so much.

 I expected emacsclient -c to open up a GUI attached to the emacs daemon. But that command too opens it up in the terminal.
 Thanks
 Edit (tl;dr): how do I open Emacs in GUI attached to the emacs daemon.

 The bm package looks like it might be configurable per-project, although it would require some hacking to support that, and even more hacking to support it properly (to support multiple projects loaded in a single emacs session).
 Another limitation of bm is it only exposes bookmarks in open buffers, again, I can hack in support to show all stored bookmarks for the repository I'm working on, but this isn't trivial - it may be simpler to use a package that already supports this.

 I am also interested in building a simulation engine for game like Majesty (a medival game where all characters are autonomous). Would this be something that would make sense to do in Haskell? I’m not talking about the graphics or other components. As a noob it seems that each unit/node will carry a lot of state so maybe not. But I want to hear from someone who knows about Haskell

 I'm at page 30, where there's an example of an error message from ghci when running: read "4"
 I just noticed that if I run it in my ghci I get a totally different feedback: instead of the expected
 "Ambiguous type variable 'a' in the contstraint:..."
 I get a totally different response:
 "*** Exception: Prelude.read: no parse"
 I'm not sure if this is expected or if it's something related to my installation of Haskell.
 For the record: I installed Haskell (version 9.0.1) through stack.

 But I remember what it does:
  
find every occurrence of some regex, say "printf," recursively in a directory tree (call this the "gather" step)
 populate a buffer with every line matching that regex; edit in that buffer as if it were a file
 on "save," have every modified line "scattered" back out to its original file
  
Anyone kind enough to point out a package that does this or something close to it?

 Let's say I have a function
 haskell sequenceMaybe :: [Maybe a] -> Maybe [a]  This allows me to do things like haskell sequenceMaybe [Just 1, Just 4]  where a is inferred to be Int. All is well
 But what if I have an array like haskell [Just 1, Just "mystring"]  is there a way to write a function that will abstract over all these types? I only need a function that return true if any of the Maybes is Nothing, or false otherwise. So I do not need any constraint on the inner type.
 Many thanks!

 The reason I am asking is just because there tends to be a choice when downloading an installation file of Intel vs Apple Silicon. Thanks everyone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to get emacs native compliation working, and keep running into the following error.
 {.example} error: Cannot find libgccjit library 
 I have tried installing emacs with native compliation a number of ways
  
 Downloading and compiling from emacs master branch
  Downloading and compiling emacs-ng from master branch
  Downloading from snap edge
  
all resulting in some variation of error being unable to find libgccjit, for example another one reads
 {.example} Error (use-package): projectile/:config: Cannot find libgccjit library Disable showing Disable logging Error (use-package): org-roam/:config: Cannot find libgccjit library Disable showing Disable logging 
 Running on pop~os~
 I thought that I may not have the right version of libgccjit installed, but it appears that I have versions for gcc 9, 10, and 11 installed (default gcc is v11)
 {.example} $> find /usr/lib/gcc/ -type f -name "*jit*" /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/include/libgccjit.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/include/libgccjit++.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/include/libgccjit.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/include/libgccjit++.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include/libgccjit.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include/libgccjit++.h 
 I can succesfully compile and run the jit example from https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html without issue.
 Any suggestions on what I need to do to get emacs to find the right libgccjit?
 Edit: Thank you, the problem has been resolved. I actually had some code in my init.el which was causing the problem.

Can someone point me to some details on the whole product type theory, as well as how the (,) data type definition results in the two arguments being surrounded in parens and separated by a comma, and treated as a tuple.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really like helm's fuzzy search for commands and buffers, but I cannot get it to work for files. Since this is such a well-known package, I assume the fault lies with me. Hopefully someone here knows what I am doing wrong.
 The situation: I am in my home directory. I want to add a note to the file ~/work/notes/todo.org.
 What I currently do: I enter "wo C-j not C-j do <Enter>", which is basically bash-style completion with C-j instead of the tab key and does not feel very helm-y.
 What the internet tells me to do: I have seen multiple posts of users claiming that I should be able to do this the helm way, e.g. entering "todo" first, then remembering the folder and narrowing with "work". However, this does not work for me. Even if I remove all my custom init settings, helm-find-files just doesn't do that.
 So what am I doing wrong? Is there a setting I need to enable?
 Other things I am aware of: I know there is also helm-find, but that a) is not fuzzy and b) takes upwards of 60 seconds (!) to find a file in my home directory even if I enter the complete file name, which is clearly not acceptable.There is also helm-projects-find-files, which seems to be for individual software projects and wants me to set up a project tree.
 I am aware that without some form of indexing, finding a file by name might just not be feasible. In that case, it would suffice if I could look for "notes", find nothing, then add a space and "work" and helm would be smart enough to expand those directories in reverse order. It feels like that is what the helm project page advertises anyway, but it just doesn't happen when I try it.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I want to open a file, navigating a file system is probably the slowest. What usually works is looking in recently accessed files, be it recentf or just searching mini-buffer history.
 Finding file in a project usually works the best (Projectile), but it would probably work even better if it could just search the entire system.
 If I'm certain I have had this file open this session and haven't killed it yet, I can try switching between buffers (C-x b), but that usually only works on short trips and is rarely ergonomic.
 So if I'm not sure if the buffer is still alive, and if what I'm looking it belongs in the same project as what I'm looking for. recentf and history don't really land themselves well to exploratory navigation. 
 What we're left with is find-file which looks and works amazingly with ivy, counsel, or even ido. But I often find myself frustrated, when changing a buffer takes more effort than you'd think it'd be necessary.
 Then I end up wishing I'd have mixed results, including recent files, input history, maybe project files, and so you could switch between them. ivy has different actions and that's cool, but can it change the data source on the fly?

 autocmd FileType c nmap <buffer> <F2> :sv <bar>terminal bash -c "gcc -o %:r % -lncurses && ./%:r && rm %:r"<CR>
 To compile and run C files quickly, it first splits the current buffer and open a new terminal buffer in the new one where it compiles the file name and run the binary, after that it deletes the binary file from the directory.
 How can I make Emacs do something similar? I used `quickrun` package before, but opening a new shell window usually destroys my other windows organization, I'd like to use something like my vim workflow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Emacs for maybe six months now on both my Windows and Linux machines for all my programming, word processing, and personal organization. Couldn't be happier with my productivity, and the community is great! Tons of tutorials, terrific documentation on almost all the packages I need, and just generally cool, helpful folks. I've followed the community's advice on a whole lot of matters, including keybindings: I read people saying that CUA bindings would interfere with the bindings of many Emacs packages, that made sense to me, so I've learned and ingrained Emacs bindings into my brain. It's great! Until those terrible, dark times when...I need to leave Emacs.
 And discover that Emacs has trashed my muscle memory.
 Whenever I'm in a browser (can't use EWW for everything...right??), I find myself constantly closing tabs when I meant to cut text. I save files when I mean to search. If I use another app for long enough, I eventually do adapt back to CUA, but if I'm rapidly switching back-and-forth between Emacs and anything else, I start making mistakes the moment I relax into autopilot.
 How do y'all handle this? Do you extend Emacs bindings out to the rest of your system (and does that work across platforms)? Do you suck it up and tread carefully outside Emacs? What do you do when you face an app that can't be easily brought into the Emacs ecosystem?

 Please give it a try. Here is a cabal.project template: https://gist.github.com/Bodigrim/9834568f075be36a1c65e7aaba6a15db
 This work would not be complete without a blazingly-fast UTF-8 validator, submitted by Koz Ross into bytestring-0.11.2.0, whose contributions were sourced via HF as an in-kind donation from MLabs. I would like to thank Emily Pillmore for encouraging me to take on this project, helping with the proposal and permissions. I'm grateful to my fellow text maintainers, who've been carefully reviewing my work in course of the last six months, as well as helpful and responsive maintainers of downstream packages and GHC developers. Thanks all, it was a pleasant journey!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have often been in the position of giving advice to a novice programmer on what text editor to adopt for their day-to-day programming. Needless to say, I always recommend Emacs.
 I estimate that I have given such recommendation to 30-40 people over the years.
 AFAIK, my success rate so far is 0.00%. 1
 I would like to improve this abysmal success rate.2
 Hence I would like to ask those of you who resisted adopting Emacs at first, but ultimately did so, what took you so long? What were the barriers?
 And to those who have a better success rate than 0.00% at getting others to adopt Emacs, what is your secret?
 1 What is even more bewildering, some of these programmers, who ended up choosing a different editor, have later told me that they wished that they could do with their editors the things that I can do with Emacs. (To hear them say such things one would think that they had had to settle for a less powerful editor, because Emacs had not been an option for them, somehow.)
 2 My motivation here is not mere proselitism. Some of the people in question are actually co-workers, and I just want them to be more productive. It pains me to see how unproductive they are on account of the editors they use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When providing a type to users, a library can also provide lenses for that type without actually depending on lens. This is because Lens is a type synonym, so you can simply write a function with the correct signature and export it, to be used like a Lens. And even though there is a wide variety of lens packages (lens, optics, microlens, etc.) such a function is likely to work with most of them.
 This is all preamble to my actual question: how can a library do the same for streams? There are a number of streaming libraries out there (conduit, pipes, streaming, streamly, etc.) and a hypothetical library author would might like to provide streams or stream combinators to users that are compatible with as many of them as possible, but don't explicitly rely on those libraries. Does anyone have any information about what this could look like (assuming its even possible)?

 After a lot of trial and errors from my config, I pinpointed to the good-scroll package which seems to behave weirdly on wayland or maybe it's on pgtk or native-comp, i am not so sure. It does not show up when running on Xorg.

 Inspired by this post, I am recreating the Unity 2D tutorial in Haskell using apecs and apecs-gloss. I am nearly done: The graphics are rendered correctly, the levels are generated appropriately, the player responds to keyboard input, etc.
 As an extra, I want to be able to control the game with the Nintendo Switch joy cons. I have successfully connected the joy cons and I'm reading the input in the stepping function (6th argument of play - called periodically) instead of the event handling function (5th argument), as the latter only recognizes keyboard and mouse input. Here is an excerpt of what I'm doing in the step function, the full details of handleSwitch can be seen here (essentially read input if the buttons are pressed when the stepping function is called, interpret the input and update the scene).
 stepGame :: Float -> C.System' () stepGame dT = do ... ASTM.forkSys (Switch.handleSwitch dT) ... 
 Unfortunately, the player may respond to the first few inputs but then the game crashes. I thought it was a race hazard so I wrapped handleSwitch in forkSys (creates a new thread for switch input) but the issue persists.
 Any ideas on what might be going wrong and how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

The only open source Linux alternative I've found is Braus, but I struggled to get it working. So, I let the matter drop - it wasn't important enough to me at the time. 
 However, it's starting to feel a bit more necessary in Emacs (for me). My entire life is in org files - both personal and professional. I tend to use separate browsers for work and personal use, so I'd love if anyone has clever solutions for this every time I open a link in Emacs. I should add, there are also times when I just want to use eww if I'm just looking up some documentation or static content. 
 I'm guessing I could either create some bindings for each browser function or I could manipulate the browser function to actually run a custom elisp function that opens a prompt. I'm just a bit curious if anyone else has felt the same way and if you have any insights you might be willing to share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, First time experience running Haskell, I wanted to spend some time learning the fundamentals during these holidays break. 
 I installed the Stack installer for windows to a Win10 core i5 (late 2019) laptop with 8 gigs of ram. I then proceeded to create an 'hello world' project - - stack downloaded GHC 8.10 and created a cabal file (very confused between cabal and stack differences but, I'll go with the flow). 
 The machine behaves well with other programing platforms. however, with Haskell/stack it seems very slow... I'm running stack build and stack test and it takes up to 1 minute in both cases if there is any change to compile (without recompilation, still takes about 30 secs).
 Was just wondering if this slowness is expected? I remember using it on a Ubuntu machine and didn't notice it being so slow. Maybe it has to do with the underlying C compiler arch?
 (edit: formatting)

If I try to file an issue on the emacs-helm github, I get this: An owner of this repository has limited the ability to open an issue to users that are collaborators on this repository. So how do I file issues? The issue might not even be with helm. The issue is when I run helm-make-projectile, it doesn't register targets as targets if they are followed by a '\' character. Not a huge deal. Just wanted to make it known. Just don't know how.

 I use a slightly modified version of the [[https://depp.brause.cc/gotham-theme/][Gotham theme]]. I want to list a couple of the advantages, in order of importance to me: 
  
The low contrast is easier on my eyes, especially in low-light settings which I prefer to work most of the day.

 I have updated my package, dtache, to version 0.2 today. In short the major improvements compared to 0.1 are:
  
Support for macOS users
 A single completion interface with support for (improved) annotations, out of the box
 The dtache-env is optional and not required for the package to work
 Better error handling
  
I made a short video going through the changes as well as showing how to use the package. The video can be seen as a continuation on the previous video about the package: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De5oXdnY5hY
 The package can be found at: https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache

I know I can use org-roam-node-find, type the name of a tag and filter the files with that tag. However, given the large amount of tags I'm using, it's very hard to memorize all of them and I don't always know the exact name of the tag I'm looking for. Therefore, having a complete list with all the tags would be very helpful for me. Do you know if there's a way of having this feature in org-roam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an org file that has content like below:
  
:PROPERTIES:
 :ID: 6dc9fdfe-d24a-4eaf-8152-1f663ba70a2e
 :END:
 #+title: example 
 * Header
 [[attachment:filename]]
  
Here the file filename is in the folder that is named based on the ID value: .attach/6d/c9fdfe-d24a-4eaf-8152-1f663ba70a2e, and I can link to the file without any issue.
 After I run org-id-get-create for * Header, I had a new ID added for the header, and it becomes something like below
  
* Header
 :PROPERTIES:
 :ID: cd858afc-45ca-4f3d-bde8-a6f68c8acad0
 :END:
 [[attachment:filename]]
  
Now the attachment link to the file filename does not work any more, I have to move the file to a new folder for the new ID created, i.e., .attach/cd/858afc-45ca-4f3d-bde8-a6f68c8acad0.
 This is annoying and I just wonder if there is a way to let the header * Header to search attachment in its parent's attachment folder as well? I tried to set org-attach-use-inheritance or set org-use-property-inheritance to t, but neither works.

 I shared Magit, Embark + WGrep, Hydra menus, Hammerspoon's editWithEmacs, and finally some functions I've written to help automate common tasks in writing pull requests (conformant to our company's Github PR template).
 I explained that while VS Code might be an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), I find Emacs to be an Integrated Computering Environment (ICE).
 I'm finding the more I use Emacs, the more I think about how I interact with files and text. I didn't convert anyone from VS Code to Emacs, but then again were I "only writing software" I probably would be using VS Code.

I don’t quite understand how to debug the Elixir LSP features (I’m mostly an elixir dev) and I don’t really know elisp to this point. I’m probably doing a bunch of awful shit and not realizing how much I could make my life easier. Plug-ins are weird, the docs confuse me. I want to learn emacs for real, and the idea of hand-rolling a vanilla config is kind of overwhelming and crazy to me. How can I dive into the world of emacs in little, manageable doses without biting off way more than I can chew or getting in over my head so far I just walk away?

 I've just set up emacs on a new machine using a configuration file that I am using already without any particular issues. 
 On the new box, every time I start up emacs, there is always the request to define the "fridge indicator" and it presents me 2 options:
 "Always"
 "Only When Focused"
 Once I pick up one choice the buffer get closed but it is quite annoying.
 What could be the cause of it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear friends,
I'm releasing phi-notes, an emacs package implementing a minor mode to work with a flavour of the Zettelkasten system I've been using for some years now.  It has the following characteristics:
Notes are identified by unique, sequential numbers (0001, 0002 etc.).
Notes may be linked using the wikilink syntax ([[0001]]).
Notes may have "parent" and "descendant" notes; they may also be linked to project notes.
Bibliographical annotation is supported with BibTeX references.
Notes may have tags (identified by #hashtags).
Notes have a YAML(ish) frontmatter to keep metadata and are (preferably, but not necessarily) written in Markdown.
The aim of this project is to develop features to ease the creation, navigation and linking of notes in one or multiple note repositories.
A sidebar functionality makes the minor-mode particularly useful for working with structure notes:

Other functionalities include: creating descendant notes, integration with helm, helm-ag and helm-bibtex; "killing" and "yanking" to notes, searching for tags and backlinks; navigation commands for visiting the parent, following links.
Some details of the implementation might be too personal, but the code may at least be useful as a starting point. I'm calling it a phi minor mode because this is how I named my system long ago.
More information and a setup guide are available on the GitHub project documentation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to combine the package better-jumper into consult so I can browse my jump points with consults nice preview and search functionality. I have tried to use the existing consult commands as a template and have come up with the following code:
 (defun consult-better-jumper () (interactive) (consult--read (better-jumper--get-jump-list) :prompt "Jump to: " :annotate (consult--line-prefix) :category 'consult-location :sort nil :require-match t :lookup #'consult--lookup-location :history '(:input consult--line-history) :add-history (thing-at-point 'symbol) :state (consult--jump-state))) 
 When I run this with M-x consult-better-jumper I get the following error:
 cl--assertion-failed: Assertion failed: (or (functionp candidates) (obarrayp candidates) (hash-table-p candidates) (not candidates) (stringp (car candidates)) (and (consp (car candidates)) (stringp (caar candidates))) (and (consp (car candidates)) (symbolp (caar candidates)))) 
 Upon investigation this error clearly comes from consult--read
 I guess my question boils down to how I can turn the list returned from `better-jumper--get-jump-list) into a data structure that consult can understand?

I’ve taken python which I found decent and enjoyable but I’ve heard mixed reviews about Haskell. I’m taking another programming class but I know myself and once it starts getting harder I might fall behind since I heard Haskell is extremely hard to learn. 
 I have about a month before classes resume and would love to do something productive with my time. So I’m wondering if anyone knows any good platforms or sites that do a really good job at teaching Haskell.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am going through Typeclassopedia, and currently got stuck at the first set of exercises in the Monad section, namely the 3rd one:
  
Implement Functor and Monad instances for Free f, defined as data Free f a = Var a | Node (f (Free f a)) You may assume that f has a Functor instance. This is known as the free monad built from the functor f.
  
I got the Functor instance for Free f, but with my Monad instance I am getting this error when trying to load it into ghci:
 • Could not deduce (Applicative (Free f)) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: Functor f bound by the instance declaration at Freemonad.hs:22:10-36 • In the instance declaration for ‘Monad (Free f)’ 
 My guess is that that's due to this part in the monad definition in Control.Monad
  
class Applicative m => Monad m where
  
which it seems like it wasn't always there.
 So:
  
Is there some other way around it, or do I have to provide instance of Applicative for Free f first? Bonus question: should Typeclassopedia be updated to include this information?
 I can't figure out how to implement Applicative for Free f, any hints?
  
In case it matters, here is my Monad instance, that I have convinced myself on paper that it should work
 instance Functor f => Monad (Free f) where return = Var (Var x) >>= g = g x (Node x) >>= g = Node $ (fmap.(flip (>>=))) g x 
 but I have also tried implementation from this stackoverflow answer and got same error in ghci.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a program in Emacs Lisp that turns a decimal number into a base-256 number. The numbers involved are very large, so here's the logic of it, where base256 is an array of unicode characters, myNum is a number in the septenseptuagintacentillions, and output is an output variable initially set to nil:
  (while (>= myNum 1) (setq output (concat output (aref base256 (mod myNum 256)))) (setq myNum (truncate (/ myNum 256)))) 
 I want to rewrite it in Haskell, but I'm having some trouble. Obviously, I can't use the same logic in Haskell, so here is what I have so far: ``` -- Builds an array of integers by taking the modulus of each iteration of dividing a number by 256 buildNum num = [mod x 256 | x <- (iterate trunkDiv num)] where trunkDiv l = truncate $ div l 256
 -- Create an array by accessing the item in my array of symbols that corresponds to a number in an array of integers mapNum nums syms = [syms !! y | y <- nums]
 main :: IO () main = do putStrLn $ mapNum (buildNum myNum) base256 ``` Now, as far as I can tell, what I need is to stop iterating when the truncated product of my number and 256 reaches 1, but I don't know where to even begin looking for that information.
 Could anybody give me some pointers on getting this to work?

This package empowers dired by giving it a modern UI in a unintrusive way. Emacs users deserve a file manager better than those popular ones on terminal such as ranger, vifm, lf since Emacs is not limited to a terminal.
 dirvish-minibuffer-preview.el is an extension for dirvish, it provides dirvish-minibuf-preview-mode, which is a feature to preview file when narrowing file/directory candidates using minibuffer.
 In dirvish, you can mark files across multiple dirvish buffers, and paste/move marked files/directory to current directory with one keystroke (dirvish-yank).
 The name dirvish is a tribute to vim-dirvish.

 If anyone is inclined to pick up where we left off, or start a brand new branch using some or all of what we did, please do! Please communicate your intent on the PR itself so if there are others who want to also work on it, you don't have to duplicate their work.
 There's another new tool in this same space, Stack Lint Extra Deps. The maintainer was kind enough to get on a phone call with us on Monday to discuss pros and cons of working on SLED vs Renovate, and the consensus is we'd all like to see Renovate support Haskell first. But Renovate is written in TypeScript and SLED is written in Haskell so if you'd like to help but don't like/know TypeScript, SLED is a good candidate to hack on :D

 (my question is not 100% emacs related, posting it here cause there are lots of programmable keyboard users on the sub and discussion might be useful)
 I am new to keyboard layouts, could you help me with the following?
  
Layer toggles vs combos
  
Let say i want to have navigation on ijkl,
 I could toggle on / off navigation layer when modifier button is pressed
 or i can make combos: modifier+i = up, modifier+j = left, etc.
 Which approach is better and when each of them should be used?
 With first you have to be mentally aware about current “modes” you are in, with second you have to keep modifier button pressed.
  
Modifiers vs different keys to express degree of action.
  
Let say i have following 3 actions: (emacs related)
 delete char
 delete word
 delete line 
 I could make them
 Modifier1 + d, Modifier1 + w, Modifier1 + e
 Or i can make them
 Modifier1 + d, Modifier2 + d, Modifier3 + d
 Which approach is better / more logical? How would you do it and why?
  
What writer/programmer friendly layouts you can recommend for inspiration? (40% or 60%, not bigger). I am not interested to learn about letter layouts (qwerty, dvorak, etc) but more about positions / layering of universal keys (delete, backspace, enter, navigation, numbers, etc) I saw miryoku layout, is there smng else to learn from?
 
Are there other resources you can recommend related to above? 
 
 p.s. I have all modifiers under thumbs

 I wonder how many people are still using ledger for their personal finance given there are a lot of online services with good phone apps.
 One of my goals in 2022 is to keep my finance in a good shape. I previously used ledger and org-capture to log transactions and reporting. but it's a lot of work given the number of transactions per week. this is one of the reasons i give up. If i continue to use emacs/ledger, i need to simplify the workflow, maybe import from CSV and convert to ledger once a week/month or something. 
 ​
 another reason I gave up is that i have joint accounts, using emacs/ledger makes it harder to share.
 ​
 any comments on how you use Emacs or not use Emacs for personal finance would be greatly appreciated!

For example if I have a file ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt and I type C-x C-f ~/foo/qux, ido-mode automatically searches ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt and autocompletes it in the find-file minibuffer.
 But when I do the same thing with fido-mode, nothing happens. In fido-mode, I am required to type the complete path like C-x C-f ~/foo/bar/baz/qux and only then it autocompletes the path to ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt.
 It seems that ido-mode can search for filename matches recursively in subdirectories. How can I get the same result in fido-mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 When folding in org-mode, if I'm not on a heading, I use outline-up-heading to move to the parent heading of the content and fold the heading using org-cycle. However, in doing so, the cursor becomes trapped in the invisible region of the heading's content, as shown by invisible-p (point), in such a way that, if I quickly change my mind and want to unfold the heading again, I can't just org-cycle again; I have to manually move the cursor into a visible region of the header, like the beginning of the line, then org-cycle to unfold.
 So basically my question is: How do I move the cursor to a visible region after folding a heading, and not get stuck in an invisible region, and be forced to move the cursor manually?
 Thank you kindly for the help!
  
UPDATE: I've solved this using (while (invisible-p (point)) (backward-char)), but it seems a tad inefficient; is there a better way to do this?

 Lot's of interest, judging from the epic threads that have ensued since then.
 There aren't many programming languages or systems where you can just assume the existence of a built-in relational database. The IBM AS/400 was one such system from the 80s. Emacs could become one if the SQLite plan is executed.
 Looking forward to org-mode tables that are backed and fed from RDBMS tables.

 I just came across this one (from here) and I wonder how I ever did without it.
 (defadvice kill-line (before kill-line-autoreindent activate) "Kill excess whitespace when joining lines. If the next line is joined to the current line, kill the extra indent whitespace in front of the next line." (when (and (eolp) (not (bolp))) (save-excursion (forward-char 1) (just-one-space 1)))) 
 Another great one that springs to mind is Radian's find-file advice that automatically creates and deletes parent directories of new files.

The new company uses Scala and many of its libraries including cats http4s fs2 affects and doobi amongst others. FP is known to us, but the scala stack looks to be super intimidating. How much should we expect to be ramping up until we get back to being productive? The code doesn't look like any code we've ever seen and we thought we had seen a lot. Concerned that my team would lose motivation and leave. Grateful for your consideration !

 I thought about using DataKinds and KindSignatures to set if the Item can be used in trades and i thought about putting the class of a mage like if he is a Mage as a Phantom type. I dunno if it's a dumb but i want to learn creative ways to enforce some properties.
 What are the cool mechanics that u can enforce using types in Haskell? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, i just started to be a good citizen and write some regression tests for my code.
 Considering i have some error-type and a function that might result in an error:
 ```haskell newtype Username = Username{unUsername::Text} data UsernameError = ErrorNameLength | ErrorNameIllegalCharacter
 -- smart constructor for username newUsername :: Text -> Either LoginError Username newUsername name = ... -- inspects argument and might return Left ```
 in my HUnit test, how would I assert that e.g. newUsername with "" results in ErrorNameLength?
 My thoughts is to do it with pattern matching in do notation, relying on the MonadFail instance of IO. While this works, i see that HUnits assertion-functions allow to provide a descriptive error message in case of failure.
 Therefore I am questioning wether this would be the correct way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my continued attempt to get mstksg's AOC template working, I temporarily gave up on my MacOS attempt (thanks again /u/simonmic for the help so far!) and switched to my Linux box. After a long failure trying to use apt-get install haskell-platform and getting unfixable (by me) dependency errors, I switched to using ghcup (why do we even have haskell-platform if it's not going to work?), and things seem to be compiling and running.
 But now I have some (hopefully basic) questions. - The "Interactive" section of the documentation says I should be able to import an AOC.Run.Interactive package. I do not see how to do this. Where / how do I run ghci to import this? I can see the Haskell file in src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs, but import AOC.Run.Interactive fails with ghci run in either the top level or down in src. If I :l src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs I get Illegal lambda-case (use LambdaCase), but I didn't think that was the right thing in the first place. I assume I'm missing something simple and obvious here? - The "Executable" section of the documentation says I should be able to get a plain old runnable executable aoc-dev. How do I get this? Right now I'm using cabal run aoc-dev run 1 a for instance. (If I do build an executable, do I need to rebuild it when I change a day's solution?)
 As always any help is most appreciated.

These are routinely synchronized via automatically-generated poll requests. Within each there is a source/shared, source/common-services, and source/projects. Only within the myproject repository there is a subdirectory source/projects/myproject.
 Problem Statement: I want to edit the common code only within the master branch. How can I have Emacs default to read-only mode when opening files from myproject/source/shared and myproject/source/common-applications, but not from myproject/projects/myproject?
 FWIW, I am using treemacs and would love to find/create some sort of hook within that context.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An opening for a Post Doctoral position on hardware acceleration of functional programming languages (specifically, Haskell), at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
 The role will involve developing a special purpose processor for Haskell, aimed at outperforming the throughput and energy performance of CPUs. The project is inspired by graph reduction machines like GRIN from the 1980s, and modern FPGA/ASIC protypes PilGRIM and Reduceron.
 Candidates should have a background in hardware design and FPGA programming. Hardware engineering experience should include circuit design, developing processor architectures, memory hierarchies and/or instruction sets. Candidates should have some understanding of functional programming. Programming language implementation experience is desirable, but not essential. The project has close industry ties with Xilinx in Ireland and QBayLogic in the Netherlands.
 It is a three year project, starting in May 2022.
 The HAFLANG project:
 https://haflang.github.io
 Job details and application form:
 https://enzj.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX/job/1716/
 The application deadline is 28th February 2022.
 Contact the project's Principle Investigator, Rob Stewart ([R.Stewart@hw.ac.uk](mailto:R.Stewart@hw.ac.uk)), with inquiries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asking this for u/Lucky-Lambda since he is a new user and has been waiting for days for moderators to approve his post:
 ==== QUOTE START ====
 I am trying to test a Stack project that contains an exe, lib, and tests. We have tests for lib now (with lib listed under test `dependencies:`), and exe depends on lib in the same way, but there is an aspect of the exe I'd like to test.
 I have tried to use `verbatim` in my package.yaml to get hpack to pass along `build-tool-depends`:, which should allow me to reference a `project:executable`. I do see it does include it at the bottom of that `test-suite` in the generated Cabal output, but I still get a `Could not find module` in the test file itself (what I am importing there is listed in the `executable` section `other-modules:`) when running `stack test`.
 I have also tried referencing the exe in the new test with `build-tools:`. It makes it into the cabal file, but without the project name prefix I originally included, and does not seem to help either.
 Any possible things I am missing or should try instead? It generates a cabal file with what I thought should work, but it does not seem to be exposing the module I am trying to import from exe in the test. Thanks so much! 
 Versions: * Stack resolver: lts-18.15 * Cabal: Cabal-3.2.1.0 * Running on a M1 Mac 12.1 in a Rosetta terminal (should not be ARM related, as it builds/tests just fine without the above attempt, just giving for context)
 ==== QUOTE END ====
 Remark from me (u/Martinsos): We also read that one solution is to move all the exe code to the lib and then exe just becomes an extremely thin wrapper. However, I love having this separation between exe and lib, on one hand to make sure that lib doesn't in any way depend on exe, and also because external/hackage dependencies are nicely separated, so I would rather avoid that if there is a nicer way to do it.

 There wasn't a followup given to this statement in the book I am reading and I am trying to wrap my head around it. It is easy to follow how a Num must be Eq, but why does it also have to be a Show. If anything I would imagine conforming to Read would be required. 
 So when you do 5 * (6::Double), internally do a read as Double for 5. 
 Is it that compiler does (read (show 5)::Double) * (6::Double)?

 This is all from withing emacs -nw -Q. This is all in the terminal, emacs not graphical.
 I am able to use emacs to edit an ecrypted .gpg file from within emacs, it asks for the password in the minibuffer and I can enter it: https://i.imgur.com/SON3tM6.png

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to learn C and I need an IDE. Since we don't have nice IDEs like Visual Studio on Linux and using Vim(the editor I usually use) as an IDE looks like a really stupid idea since bloating it with a bunch of plugins will make it slow and unpleasant to use, I am turning to Emacs which is more than a text editor(how much more I don't know, I just know it isn't just a text editor) and you can bloat it with plugins without really slowing it down much. I chose DOOM Emacs because I played with it half a year ago and liked the fact that it used the Vim key bindings by default, so I didn't really have to re-learn how to edit text files, and the fact that it comes pre-configured in a nice way, saving me a lot of time.
 Anyway, what I want to ask is if I can turn Emacs into a nice C ID, and if it is possible, how do I do that. Thanks in advance.

released. This
was the first release in more than two years. More than 195
individuals contributed to this release. Since Tweag is the biggest
contributor to the Nix project, I’d like to highlight some of the
features that Tweag has worked on.

Flakes
Flakes are a new format to package Nix-based projects in a more
discoverable, composable, consistent and reproducible way. A flake is
just a repository or tarball containing a file named flake.nix that
specifies dependencies on other flakes and returns any Nix assets such
as packages, Nixpkgs overlays, NixOS modules or CI tests.
You can read more about flakes in the following blog posts:

 I use emacs mostly for academic writing. As a beginner, I thoroughly enjoy org-mode. However, for practical reasons (journal submission, co-authoring, etc.), I need to create a word document (.docx) more often than I thought. I've used pandoc to convert .tex to .docx, which I am more or less satisfied with. 
 I wonder if anyone has a nice workflow for academic writing, which often needs to end up with a word document. For example, if a bibliography is included, which, markdown or org-mode, gives you a better experience? Or are there other options? Any suggestion will be welcome!

To give you some context, I never professionally worked with Scala so I have a lot of assumptions which certainly aren't applicable.
 My first question would be about Tagless Final and ZIO. Because ZIO embeds its own Error type as ZIO[R, E, A], if using ZIO as a Tagless Final, it becomes possible to abstract and hide away one layer or Errors. So I have been trying to separate System errors from Business errors in the sake of having a Domain layer curated of error handling for the System errors.
 System error would be, what I qualify as lower level and environmental errors, as network connection drop, remote service being unreachable, etc. Business erro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am interested in creating a "filtered" switch-to-buffer function. I was looking into the read-buffer function as its 4th argument PREDICATE mentions
  
Optional arg PREDICATE, if non-nil, is a function limiting the buffers that 
 can be considered. It will be called with each potential candidate, in 
 the form of either a string or a cons cell whose car is a string, and 
 should return non-nil to accept the candidate for completion, nil otherwise.
  
To my understanding, the predicate function needs to take one input argument which is a string or cons cell and when read-buffer is called it will pass every open buffer to the function and will only output those buffers that returned a non-nil value. At least this is what I understand from the docstring. 
 However, in practice, how exactly would you call read-buffer with this function as its 4th argument. I couldn't find any info online about it so I was wondering if this community had any clue how it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/hashkell !
 I'm working on a programming assignment where I'm asked to speed up a BFS type algorithm (a N-puzzle solver to be specific) with parallelism. I've tried using parMap to evaluate the next the potential moves and their costs in parallel. But this has only made my program slower. Is there something wrong with my approach?
 I'd also like to run the actual path finding recursion with all candidates (or the best two) at the same time but I've heard this isn't really possible due to the function returning an IO(). Is there anything I can do to make this part of the program go faster?
 Ideally I want something like this:
 for each state in possible_future_states: new thread(target=BFS, args=variables updated with this state being chosen) 
 Thank you for reading this. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

 This is my current attempt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have decided to spice up my holiday coding session consisting of nigths between 22/12-07/01 by swapping VIM for Emacs, so I have a couple questions.
 Premise for the setup; I'll start from vanilla Emacs and I aim to have a minimal set of packages enabling me to write some C/C++ with completion (lsp and/or deep stuff not necessary) and a nice (simple) way to browse project related files.
 Questions:
  
What packages do you recommend and why?
 Configuration recommendations/snippets?
 Keybindings you can't live without?
 Suggestions on good/must reads on the topic?
  
I've set up a repo containing some initial configuration which you can find here: https://codeberg.org/0xedd1e/dotfiles
 So far I've found Emacs to be really interesting and the package management seems superb (and easy). I also want to mention that I will not install evil-mode, at least not during this period.
 Ps. Not interested in an Emacs dist, I like keeping stuff clean and understandable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i tried to write a program with a gui and decided to use gloss to render it. But when i try to import the module, Graphics.Gloss it says it's not found. So then i tried to cabal install gloss but it outputs the following error message:
 cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library: * Missing (or bad) C library: GL This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that provides this library (you may need the "-dev" version). If the library is already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags --extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where it is.If the library file does exist, it may contain errors that are caught by the C compiler at the preprocessing stage. In this case you can re-run configure with the verbosity flag -v3 to see the error messages. cabal: Failed to build OpenGLRaw-3.3.4.1 (which is required by gloss-1.13.2.1). See the build log above for details. 
 So naturally i tried to install the library with cabal, OpenGlRaw but that gave the same error message except the gloss part. I tried to find information about this library but couldn't find anything useful for me, I am using nixos but the error appears on a secondary computer with fedora as well. I have opengl installed through my NixOS configuration and i have tried several c compilers or other openGL packages. This may not have to do with haskell but i assume i will get just as much help here as on r/NixOS 
 I am glad for anyone taking their time to help me.

 let n = parseInt(data, 10)

 I am using the vscode css-language-server binary with eglot, and it's working great in css files, but when I open up sass files, it does not work with the current sass syntax that does not have braces or semi-colons. When I type the css-ls auto-completion does not work correctly, and syntax errors get thrown even though the syntax is correct and sass code compiles fine without any errors.
 Any tips on how to fix this issue?
 I'm guessing that sass-mode needs to get installed and configured with css-ls/eglot in use-package(my setup)?
 Thanks in advance for the help

What I have in mind is something that would look like the old school PDAs or this new Gemini PDA device. It would be great to be able to physically mount thid keyboard to the phone to mimic the clamshell form factor of a PDA and get a fully mobile emacs and org mode experience. Any thoughts are appreciated.

 It started when I realized that Info-mode was presenting links with an illegibly bright cyan, which I realized was #00ffff. This is despite the fact that modus-themes supports info-mode, defines a cyan which is not that color, and I have no other theme loaded.
 So why was info-mode using the "wrong" cyan? Or do I need to take special steps to configure modus-themes to apply to info-mode?
 For that matter, how come I can't see modus-theme's cyan anywhere in the list shown by list-colors-display? And where do the other named and defined colors on that list come from?
 How do I even get the color of the character at point?
 I realize these are basic questions but I'd appreciate any pointers on how to understand this are better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't figure this out...
 I use a basic org-capture template:
 (setq 
 org-capture-templates
 \(`
 ("t" "Task" entry (file "~/.config/emacs/journal/tasks.org")
 "* TODO %?\n\n %U\n %a\n %i" :empty-lines 1)
 ("i" "Idea" entry (file "~/.config/emacs/journal/ideas.org")
 "* IDEA %?\n\n %U\n %a\n %i" :empty-lines 1)
 ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/.config/emacs/journal/journal.org")
 "* %?\n %i\n")
 )
 )
 When I start the capture and select 'j' to create a Journal entry, my first line has 7 stars. This causes the entry to start too far to the right and it looks weird. I can't figure out why so many stars? Instead of 7, I expect maybe 4 stars:
 * Year
 ** Year-Month
 *** Year-Month-Day
 **** new journal entry goes here
 In an effort to learn elisp and try to fix the problem, I tried to modify org-datetree.el in the ~/.emacs/elpa/org-9.5.1 directory and recompile via emacs-lisp-recompile function after visiting the file. My modifications change the output (I removed tabs for example), but then it removes all of the dates! I don't want to mess too much with the el file as my configuration is getting to a nice stable state.
 Any ideas why so many stars? Thanks in advance for looking at this!

 I use Emacs for writing scientific texts in LaTeX, and so a spell checker/grammar checker is obviously important. I have yet to find a solution that I am happy with, so I would like to hear if anyone has some good suggestions.
 I have earlier used flyspell, but it falls short compared to Grammarly, LanguageTool and Trinka, as it only corrects words, and has no "contextual" understanding.
 I have tested lsp-ltex, which worded quite well, but I found it way too intrusive. Sure, I could probably have gotten it to work if i tinkered enough, but I feel like something so essential as a spell checker should be simple. For reference, below are two other threads related to this, but I did not find the answers there satisfactory; in particular I feel like many of the solutions are made for pure programming languages, and then bodged together to work with LaTeX.

 I'm a regular Emacs user, testing the version 28 for some months ago (right now in 28.0.90). 
 Looking at the git repo and the devel mailing list, I was wondering if there are criteria/policies/requirements to declare a branch stable enough to be released. 
 The nearest example is, of course, Emacs 28, but I don't know if there are some guidelines for any future release (28.2, 29, etc). 
 Thanks.

 Title says it. Looking for a keyboard with relatively small space bar / more space for modifiers which can be pressed with thumbs.
 On my keyboard now with left thumb i can press comfortably first closest to space bar modifier, somewhat comfortably second closest to space modifier; with right thumb even first closest to space modifier is not comfortable.
 Priorities
 - portable

 Usage - programming / typing
 OS - windows / android
 ​
 Options i am considering:
 - JIS (japanese) layout keyboard

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to figure what is done to figure out the searched symbol name when xref-find-definitions is called.
 The problem is the following. When I'm in org mode and in elisp source code block I try to use xref-find-definitions when my cursor is located on a string ";; `own-variable'". Then emacs says "no definitions found for "own-variable'". So it somehow falsely thinks that the final single quote is also part of a symbol name. How do I find what is being used to decide what's the searched symbol name?
 I tried profiling, and debug-on-entry for xref-find-definitions but that seems to be too late. The symbol name is already been made.
 I have an impression that Org mode uses "pcomplete-completions-at-point" for this completion but I did not manage to use debug-on-entry for that. I found the pcomplete-completions-at-point function by evaluating "completion-at-point-functions" in the buffer.
 Any tips would be welcome.
 EDIT: I'm able to jump to the definition with the following combination: M-x find-variable RET RET.

 I have found some github projects that deals with creating cards with org-mode, but not the other way arround.
 I eventually would like to convert notes (org files) to anki cards, but to be able to do that I first have to export my existing anki cards to org-mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! This is my first time posting on this subreddit. 
 I am currently an intern at a bank that's using Java and Spring for almost all of its backend services. My mentor tasked me to explore the basics of Scala for backend services so I'm here to ask for recommendations how one would build backend services as I've read around Scala doesn't depend as much on frameworks as Java does. 
 I've read on some 'frameworks' for Scala such as Play and Http4s, but the resources on those are quite scarce, and I've tried Http4s but I can't get my head to wrap around dependency management using sbt.
 Are there any recommendations you would give me for learning?
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running the following with stack script --resolver=ghc-9.0.1 works, but running with stack script --resolver=ghc-9.2.1 results in a stack overflow. Oddly, it works on ghc-9.2.1 compiling with -O2 but hangs when compiling with -O0.
 This behavior is surprising to me because, to my understanding, UndecidableSuperClasses carries the risk of infinite loops when type-checking, but at compile-time, it should concretize m and FooM m and the constraints should be erased. Is this not what happens? And did anything change in GHC 9.2 regarding UndecidableSuperClasses?
 I've also dumped out -ddump-tc for both -O2 and -O0, but I don't see any meaningful differences.
 Repro:
 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-} {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-} {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableSuperClasses #-} import Data.Kind (Type) class (Monad m, MonadFoo (FooM m)) => MonadFoo m where type FooM m :: Type -> Type runFoo :: FooM m a -> m a newtype MyMonad m a = MyMonad { runMyMonad :: m a } deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad) instance Monad m => MonadFoo (MyMonad m) where type FooM (MyMonad m) = MyMonad m runFoo = id main :: IO () main = runMyMonad foo foo :: MonadFoo m => m () foo = runFoo $ return () 
 Update: It seems reproducible with even main = runMyMonad $ runFoo $ return ()

 Where do you map all your extra commands to so you don't constantly fight with major-modes?

 Note: a coin with a unit value is always assumed to exist in the given set of coins.
 Examples:
  
 Coins Amount min. no. of coins 
  
 {1,5,10,25} 1 1 
  {1,5,10,25} 4 4 
  {1,5,10,25} 5 1

  {1,5,10,21,25} 63 3 
 
  
Say we are given a set of coins Cs = {1,5,10,21,25} and we want to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up 63, then the algorithm below essentially translates to the following:
  answer = min_coins(Cs, 63) = minimum ( min_coins(Cs, 62) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 58) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 53) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 42) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 38) + 1 )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been a happy Gnus user for years. Recently, though, it was persuasively brought to my attention that threads are fundamental to how emails work, so I have introduced some redundancy to my system in order to make the threads work. Now I find myself conflicted about how to resolve these three constraints:
  
Make "sent" messages visible anywhere, as sometimes I use a different computer at a different location. For this, I've made an email account which has the sole purpose of receiving BCC of all emails I send, and so I subscribe to this SENT inbox to get those messages.
 
I use the GCC field to store a local version of my email upon sending, which has the advantage of storing the BCC recipients that are omitted from my SENT emails (especially useful when I send an "undisclosed recipients" email).
 
I wish to see things in both my Sent folder and in-thread in my usual inbox location. This is working except that I end up with duplicates of message I've sent. I expect one in my sent folder and another in my inbox, but I am receiving two in my inbox, and (gnus-summary-ignore-duplicates t) doesn't seem to make any noticeable difference, even though one of the messages I end up with in my inbox states "this is a duplicate".
 Any improvements or alternatives that meet the needs of synchronizing mail across machines, maintaining a "sent" box, and allowing email threading in my inbox?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working with lsp and company and found a very annoying feature that i would like to disable, when there is only one thing that can be suggested it is displayed like the image below, basically the word or symbol is "auto completed" on its own if i press tab if it is only a single suggestion. The problem is when i type too fast, for some reason this auto complete lags behind and actually affects the characters i input. So if i start typing sudo like below, if i am fast enough it will end up ignoring some of my input characters and i end up with suo or sdo sometimes. This placeholder is nice, to see but i dont want it to affect my actual keyboard input because it is slower than my type speed.

 EDIT: The issue did not seem to be related to the tooltip, nonetheless the answers below offer a perfectly good solution to replacing the tooltip with either nothing or the default company auto complete box (with only one suggestion). The problem was for some reason related to only typing the character "t" (for some reason) and the binding to (tab) i used to trigger auto complete in addition to enter (<return>). 
 (define-key company-active-map (kbd "tab") #'company-complete-selection) 
 This above was causing the character "t", when typed in the buffer while company was filtering, to somehow lose focus from the buffer and stop typing in it.
 (define-key company-active-map [tab] #'company-complete-selection) 
 This however works fine, and tab also does what it is supposed to be doing - completing the marked suggestion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, my question relates to what is the best approach to add some customization in a package's implementation. For example, the code block below I have added some lines to the initial implementation but, I am not sure, wether this is practical since some updates later will ament the code added in the file. 
 I hope I am clear, but to add some clarification, while I am adding/editing the code in the package's implementation found in the installation, would there be a more efficient way to call this instead of editing the file here. 
 Example below -commented lines are the ones I have added in the original file- after updating the package they will be lost
 (defun sclang-switch-to-workspace () (interactive) (let ((buffer (get-buffer sclang-workspace-buffer))) (unless buffer (setq buffer (get-buffer-create sclang-workspace-buffer)) (with-current-buffer buffer (sclang-mode) (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (set-keymap-parent map sclang-mode-map) (sclang-fill-workspace-mode-map map) (use-local-map map)) (let ((line (concat "// " (make-string 69 ?=) "\n"))) (insert line) (insert "// SuperCollider Workspace \n") ;; (insert "// " (current-time-string) "\n") ;; (insert "// Ready to do thy Biding Master " (user-login-name) "\n") ;; (insert line) (insert "// using HTML Help: C-c C-h as usual, then switch to w3m buffer\n") (insert "// and do M-x sclang-minor-mode in order te enable sclang code execution\n") (insert line) (insert "\n")) (set-buffer-modified-p nil) cwd to sclang-runtime-directory (if (and sclang-runtime-directory (file-directory-p sclang-runtime-directory)) (setq default-directory sclang-runtime-directory)))) (switch-to-buffer buffer)))

I have switched to a new job, now in my previous role I was working as a data engineer (scala and spark) and in the new role they want to put me in a team which deals with data processing (scala, spark, Kafka, akka streams, samza) but there is another team which deals with rest api development (scala, akka http, grpc, cats). I can choose where I want to be but this is where I am not able to make a decision. They have also told me that in future if I feel like the type of work I am doing is not for me then I can ask for change. Just want your inputs.

 The issue is back-links won't show up in my org-roam buffer.
 This is my config:
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") t) (setq org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/org-roam")) (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) (require 'org-roam) (org-roam-setup) 
 I have installed org-roam, and org-roam--sqlite-available-p is set to t.
 I created the nodes with org-roam-node-insert and can follow the links just fine with org-open-at-point.
 You can see my org-roam folder here (and my config file is in there too).
 https://github.com/thread314/org-roam-troubleshoot
 I've deleted my .emacs.d folder and run emacs -Q, same result. I've even tried it on a completely fresh virtual machine, backlinks still won't show up.
 I am running Emacs 27.2, Org 9.4.4 and Org-Roam 2.1.0.
 I have tried asking for help on the org-roam discourse and on the org-roam slack, no luck with either.
 I must be doing something wrong, but I just can't figure out what. Can anyone help?
 I'd be happy to make a donation of $200 AUD to a charity of your choosing if you can help me with this (if that helps sweeten the pot).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been going through the University of Finland MOOC course on haskell, and this example popped up:
 ​
 someLetters :: Gen String someLetters = do c <- elements "xyzw" n <- choose (1,10) return (replicate n c) *Examples.QuickCheck> sample someLetters "yyyyyyyy" "zzzzzzzzz" "xxxxxxxxx" "yyyyyyy" "yyy" "ww" "xxxxxx" "yyy" "yyyyyyy" "xxxxxxxxxx" "y" 
 My question is how is this 'someletters' fn a pure fn? It will always return a List of strings, but the strings will always be different. If it was modified to pass in a starting string, it would still produce a list of random length strings, so the even if the parameter is the same, the results will be different almost all of the time.
 Or is it not a pure fn, and is it then fairly easy to write non-pure functions in Haskell?
 TIA

 When I tangle, I want this output:

 But what I get is this; the second block is dedented, which produces broken output:

 Is there some way to get Org to preserve whitespace in source blocks?

 I am looking to solve the following problem. I am using org-agenda to view items marked as TODO. This presents a list. The list is long and it's a bit difficult to scan. Ideally, I would like to have an interface where only the first item would load, I would hit "n" and then the next and the next and so on until there are no items left.
 Is this possible to do? What are the steps to take to achieve this?
 Thanks very much!
 I am running Spacemacs (0.200.13@27.2)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! :)
 I wanted to share a package that I have developed. This package makes it possible to run, and interact, with shell commands that are run completely detached from Emacs. The name of the package comes from dtach, which is the program that makes this package possible. 
 As a user you start shell commands in dedicated sessions using dtache. Here is a list of some of the features that these sessions offer:
 - The user have access to all of the output from a session
 - The user gets a notification when a session has finished
 - Sessions are automatically labeled success or failure
 - Sessions can be started on remote hosts
 - The user can easily rerun a session
 - Sessions can be opened in a compile mode, which effectively makes it mimics M-x compile
 For a more thorough walk through of the package, and how to use it, you can watch this video which I have created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if1W58SrClk
 And the package itself you can find at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellow 'macsers, and in particular, hej fellow hyperbole users,
 I recently started using Hyperbole as a knowledge base and must say I am quite satisfied. I have in as an org extension so I get the benefit of being able to hide/show contents while retaining the functionality of hyperbole/hyrolo (I believe, correct me if I'm wrong).
 However, there's one thing that really annoys me, and I would like to know how to change that. Whenever I come out of a hyrolo-fgrep query, my hyrolo file is in read-only mode. Which means that I have to change out of it every time I made an edit. I C-s'ed through the Hyperbole manual but couldn't find it mentioned anywhere.
 Since I am not yet very proficient with the inner workings of my kitchen-si *ahem* batteries-included computing environment I don't even have a good idea on how to debug it. Thus, any more or less general considerations are also warmly welcomed!
 Have a good day, fellows :)

This year, me and fellow hacker cab404
had organized a hackathon to help the cause and spread the Nix love
around. The basic premise was, quoting cab404:
Go—go—go!
We wanted to fix as many builds as possible, right before the
branchoff. Fixing the broken builds would allow NixOS 21.11 to have a more complete package
set.
The main point of this post is to share the experience with people
looking to organize similar events.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to match generic implicit conversion with quotes. Minified example:
 case class Wrapper[T](i: T) given converter[T]: Conversion[Wrapper[T], T] with def apply(wrapper: Wrapper[T]) = wrapper.i conversionParser { 1 + Wrapper(2) } 
 with
 // Want it to print "Success" def conversionParserImpl[T: Type](expr: Expr[T])(using Quotes): Expr[Unit] = println(s"Matching ${expr.show}") expr match case '{($a: Int) + ($b: Int)} => println("Addition") conversionParserImpl(a) conversionParserImpl(b) case '{$a: Int} if a.value.isDefined => println(s"Literal: ${a.valueOrAbort}") case '{converter.apply($a)} => println("Success") case _ => println("Not matched") '{()} inline def conversionParser[T](inline expr: T) = ${ conversionParserImpl('expr) 
 But output is:
 Matching 1.+(Main$package.converter[scala.Int].apply(Wrapper.apply[scala.Int](2))) Addition Matching 1 Literal: 1 Matching Main$package.converter[scala.Int].apply(Wrapper.apply[scala.Int](2)) Not matched 
 If the converter is changed from generic to concrete Int, then the quoted code matches without any changes to the macro. Tried case '{converter[Int].apply($a)} in the generic case, doesn't fix it.
 Thanks in advance for your help :)

 Also, maybe related, when trying to run fzf from the *shell* it doesn't provide the autocomplete list, even though it does so in windows cmd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a while I've been lurking on the development of cell-mode [1], an Emacs mode created by David O'Toole. The blurb says:
  
Cell-mode is an object-oriented spreadsheet control for GNU Emacs. It provides a major mode for spreadsheet-based user interfaces; it can be further extended by defining application-specific Emacs Lisp minor modes which supply new cell and spreadsheet classes via Emacs’ included object system, EIEIO.
  
I decided to create this post because I am not sure how widely known this mode is, and I'd like to raise attention to it. Personally, I think it is an amazing idea - a magit or org-mode-like "killer app" for Emacs. It may sound like I'm exaggerating (and perhaps I am), but just off the top of my head I can think of a few really interesting use cases:
  
integrate it with org-mode as a table editor. You could edit the table in cell-mode and then see the ascii representation.
 integrate it with modes such as SQL mode and the like, so that you could visualise the table output as a cell-mode spreadsheet.
 as just a plain old spreadsheet. Most of my use cases for excel would probably go away with it plus Emacs lisp.
 easy CSV (etc) editing.
 derived modes (see mosaic [2] by the same author).
  
I'm sure many more use cases would quickly emerge by integrating it with other modes. If you use cell-mode or know of similar modes in this space do let me know on the comments.
 Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with David O'Toole or cell-mode development, just a regular Emacs user.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favorite parts of Org-mode is the customizable colored headers; personally, it makes me extremely motivated to work and makes Org-mode so much more beautiful. Here's a quick script I made to make changing those colors easier, and hopefully, someone finds this helpful!
 ​
  
First, generate a palette you like from this color palette generator: https://coolors.co
 Copy the RGB color codes, separated by hyphens, from the url
 Paste it into the list in the same format as I have in the below code snippet
 Copy the code into your init file somewhere
  
Essentially, the code splits the string into a list of codes, then the face attributes set the org header colors to the corresponding list colors.
 I'd like to turn this into a package one day, but that's a project for another time (or if someone wants to help me, I'd love to work with them). And finally, if anyone uses this, drop your color palettes below!
 ​
  (defun col-strip (col-str) (butlast (split-string (mapconcat (lambda (x) (concat "#" x " ")) (split-string col-str "-") "") " "))) (setq color-schemes (list (col-strip "a21d1d-5497de-8e35b7-ffff5b-56cb7d-df5252-707efa") ; red blue purple study (col-strip "2278bf-e15554-3bb273-507c6d-6e5775-598d91-7768ae") ; blue red green okay )) (setq pick-color 0) (setq color-theme (nth pick-color color-schemes)) (set-face-attribute 'org-level-1 nil :height 1.3 :foreground (nth 0 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute 'org-level-2 nil :height 1.2 :foreground (nth 1 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute 'org-level-3 nil :height 1.1 :foreground (nth 2 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute 'org-level-4 nil :height 1.05 :foreground (nth 3 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute 'org-level-5 nil :foreground (nth 4 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute 'org-level-6 nil :foreground (nth 5 color-theme))

I always run it in GHCI, and when I was using Stack I'm pretty sure I could rebuild incrementally. But then it stopped building in Stack, so I switched to Cabal, which only lets me rebuild incrementally for one subproject at a time -- if I make changes to another subproject, I have to quit and rerun cabal ghci. So suddenly compilation was taking a long time.
 I ducked the problem by just making it a monorepo again. But it made me wonder -- how hard would it be to make compiled code content-addressed, like Unison does?

        <link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/rg7kmp/how_to_build_a_list_comprehension_with_unknown/"/>
        <updated>2021-12-14T13:32:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[List comprehension is a very appealing feature in Haskell. It could support a form of non-deterministic computation. 
 For example,
  [[x,y] | x <- [0..2], y <- [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] 
 However, this construct is too static. I mean that these two generators (x <- [0..2] and y <- [0..2]) are solidified in the code. If the number of generators is unknown (e.g. List of generators as input), there is no way to use the List comprehension gracefully. 
 One way to solve the problem is using Traversable:
  sequenceA [[0..2], [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] 
 Now we have a List of generators. So far so good.
 The drawback of this approach is that it cannot handle the variables' references in a generator's body.
 For example, 
  [[x,y] | x <- [0..2], y <- [10*x..10*x+2]] 
 We cannot represent [10*x..10*x+2] in sequenceA.
 Question:
 Is there any general way to do this job in Haskell? Maybe something like sequenceA, but can handle variables' references. Or do we have to write a small interpreter?
 Thanks
  
Edit:
 Some one possibly misunderstand my question.
 For example, if we just using List comprehension (or do-notation), how do we represent the following pattern in general way?
 ``` [[x1] | x1 <- [0..2]]
 [[x1,x2] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2]]
 [[x1,x2,x3] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 <- [100x2..100x2+2]]
 [[x1,x2,x3,x4] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 <- [100x2..100x2+2], x4 <- [1000x3..1000x3+2]]
 -- and so on ```
 It could be solved by code generation and interpreter pattern, but I hope a better way. It would be nice if code can be seen as data (e.g. List).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firstly doom emacs is great and God bless hlissner. But there's one issue I've not yet been able to solve. 
 In doom emacs when the cursor is on a string, it highlights the entire string. But this really slows the app down and makes the editing process really annoying in the case of long strings. 
 Example
 In the above link, I am trying to edit a graphql schema which is a multi line string. And the entire string being highlighted every moment makes it really laggy and nearly impossible to edit. 
 So my question is how do I turn of this string highlighting feature in doom emacs? Thanks
 PS: I have googled for this but I couldn't find te solution to this exact problem. Most of the solutions were to disable the hl-line mode which I don't have a problem with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm hiring Haskell developers again, for the Core Strats team of Modeling and Analytics. The head of our group has given a talk at the Haskell Implementer's Workshop last month where he described the team and what we do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A70SN7vFsKU
 ​
 Applications must go via these links:
 Warsaw: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=128083
 London: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100029752
 ​
 The Warsaw position is open to both contractors and direct employment, whereas the London one is only open for direct employment. Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll (PL or UK in this case), and after an initial 3-month in-office period (where circumstances allow). We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful employment applicants.
 Note that the first step of the application is a Valued Behaviours Assessment and it is quite important: our team won't be able to see your application until you pass this assessment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I'm currently writing up my PhD thesis using org-mode, and it is a joy in comparison to my past experiences writing raw LaTeX. 
 I'm simultaneously attempting to write up some of the thesis chapters in paper form for publication, and have been creating the papers by selectively #+INCLUDE -ing the thesis chapter .org files. I very much dislike the idea of maintaining the same text in multiple files (fix a typo or re-word something in one, will I remember to propagate those changes throughout?), however the text required for the papers needs to be somewhat more concise than what appears in the thesis. So far I have handled this by having org files containing the core text for a section, which appears in both the thesis and the paper, and another org file that expands on the core and appears in the thesis only. 
 This approach works well enough, but falls down when I want to interleave concise text and extended text. I could use the line number option for the include command to achieve this, however the text is changing too often for this to be practical. The natural conclusion seems to be to break things down even further, and to have separate org files per paragraph of text, and to construct larger documents out of these. 
 Does anyone here have any experience of something like this (maybe there are packages which could help?), or perhaps better ideas (i.e. am I being a lunatic)?
 Thanks!

 The file it’s picking up is an old conflicted copy (by NextCloud sync) that I have since removed. It manages to show the old contents of that file so I assume it’s caches somewhere.
 Is my assumption correct? Is there a cache somewhere?
 I am using emacsclient and I have restarted it a couple of times with kill-emacs.

 What is the recommended best practice for doing this with cabal? I tried google, but it appears as though my googlefu need some work. My cabal file, as well as the rest of the project can be found here.
 If any more information is needed, please do let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading a discussion about keyboards and decided that maybe this is something that would benefit others.
 I have been pressing Ctrl with my palm for years (just below left pinky). It only works with external keyboards, and it does not work very well for all Ctrl combinations (e.g. Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-X is at the limit of doable, in that case I use the right ctrl).
 but it has saved my pinky from being overworked
 (and yes, I tried dvorak, but I could not get used to emacs ctrl sequences no matter how much I tried... i was able to get to around 40-50 words a minute for text, but like 1 emacs command per minute --after 59 wrong commands).
 Aside from mapping CAPS lock to Ctrl, are there any other tricks people use with the typical keyboard?
 Edit: somebody mentioned that this is probably useful only for small sizes of hands. When fully extended my hands are 21cm from tip of thumb to tip of pinky.

I've tried the vlc package from melpa, I've fiddled around with the vlc.el file for hours, followed tutorials, and I got nothing to work right. Does anyone have any advice? If it's relevant, I'm on Windows 10.

 I've been using ghcup to manage and install ghc, stack, and cabal on my mac. Now I tried installing ghc on windows with Chocolatey and Haskell Platform. It installs version 9.2.1 by default with `choco install haskell-dev`. I need version 8.10.7 installed since some packages that I'm using are not yet supported under 9.2.1. What's the recommended way to install 8.10.7. Is ghcup a viable alternative? I tried it and it seems not to have "tui" available on Windows for some reason.
 Thank you!

I don't know where I should report this to. In vscode and the terminal it shows just the Delete ';' part. Is this an ESlint or LSP error?

 I hope this makes sense
  
EDIT. In the meanwhile I removed eslint-plugin-prettier and installed prettier.el. I don't really need linting hints showing up as errors as it gets fixed on save, so this is great

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am trying to play around with semantic highlighting in lsp, and what i was trying to do is properly highlight usages of a function's argument/parameter within a given scope (say, code block, function etc.), and not only at the declaration point. It seems that lsp does understand scopes, looking through the source i found out that faces such as lsp-face-highlight-write/read/textual - which do actually highlight the variable when i hover over it with the cursor. Now i am looking at doing the same but make it permanent, not only when you hover over the symbol. Trying to do that for both member variables and function argument variables. Lsp has lsp-face-semhl-member & lsp-face-semhl-parameter which are only coloured at the point of declaration.
 In the example below, crude, but member variables are purple, while the ones passed as function arguments are underlined-pink. (The Styling is just a sample)

 ​
 I have brew (3.3.7), stack (2.7.3), and Cabal (3.6.2) installed, and I thought something as simple as "cabal update" or "brew update" or "stack update" would somehow magically work.
 ​
 For context, I am used to archlinux where arch documentation, a simple pacman -Syu or grabbing from the AUR solves 99.98% of my problems. But I am relatively new to apple hardware for development.
 Thanks a ton, and I apologize for the ignorance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use emacs on various machines. I run the same init.el and set of packages everywhere, but different versions of emacs itself. In particular I want my setup to support a relatively old version of emacs (26.3) which I can find or easily install on random machines.
 As a result, I'd like to upgrade my packages but only when they are compatible with this maximum allowed version of emacs itself.
 I can hit "U" in the package list to mark all packages which can be upgraded up to my current emacs version. What I do now is manually inspect the upgrade list, checking the dependencies of each marked package, and removing items which require a too advanced version of emacs. But this is cumbersome.
 Is there a command or a programmatic way to restrict this list to show only the upgrades which are compatible with the maximum allowed emacs version? I can't find any commands for this. I looked for package functions for querying a package's dependencies by package name, but it seems like most of the functions in package.el need a package-desc as input, and I'm not sure how to get that struct only from a package name and for available rather than installed versions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am trying to write a function for prettifying symbols on a per-mode basis. The idea is to accept the mode-hook and a list of substitutions, and then to create a hook and engage it with the mode-hook. The function looks like this:
  (defun +xx/prettify-symbols-set-hook (mode-hook symbol-list) (interactive) (add-hook mode-hook (lambda () (mapc (lambda (pair) (push pair prettify-symbols-alist)) symbol-list) (global-prettify-symbols-mode 1))) (message "Hook set.")) 
 An example of the intended use would be:
 (+xx/prettify-symbols-set-hook 'org-mode-hook '(("#+BEGIN_SRC" . ?») ("#+begin_src" . ?») ("#+END_SRC" . ?«) ("#+end_src" . ?«))) 
 I get no errors, but the hook does not seem to work. When I open new buffers of the given mode, the pretty-symbols do not appear. Any comments/suggestions would be very welcome as I am have very limited elisp experience.

 I don't understand how to get an index of locally available documentation and installed packages.
 I added the flag: "Documentation: True", and indeed if I navigate to: '~/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/attoparsec-0.14.3-a88f9f2009aaf50ec4de28c96eaab575e97e192943bebbfec18a608dffd670fd/share/doc/html', all the docs are there, and they even link back to the ghc documentation (in 'file:///home/jurjen/.ghcup/ghc/8.10.7/share/doc/ghc-8.10.7/html/libraries'), which is great!
 But navigating or exploring to such funky directories is unwieldy and I cannot find a generated index and they are not linked into the standard index living in 'ghcup/.../share/doc/ghc-8.10/html' which is annoying since that is my main source of information for installed packages.
 I tried to set the options 
  docdir: /home/jurjen/.ghcup/share/doc/$abi/html/libraries/$libname htmldir: /home/jurjen/.ghcup/share/doc/$abi/html haddockdir: $htmldir 
 But that didn't seem to do nothing. Anyone know how to make a global index of all (user) installed packages with cabal?

 I wanted to decrease the start time in emacs and from what i read i have to activate daemon which i did but it created some kind of confusion for me! 
 Basically created a symlink with ln -s /etc/init.d/emacs /etc/init.d/emacs.myuser then activated in my run devel!
 What is happening when i am lunching emacs ? Am i lunching an emacs client ? is the emacs server the same thing as emacs client ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings from Canada 🙂
I was using nvAlt and Simplenote together for about 10 years and recently migrated to my own app, Hyperdraft, which I consider a web remake of Notational Velocity; my app is not based on files, but it supports markdown and you can own your data.
I'm interested in the idea of 'turning your text notes into a website' and have been cultivating a digital garden / personal wiki for about a year now, inspired by Andy Matuschak; in the same place as my private notes, I have other ones that are 'public', and they appear as pages on this website (wiki links become public URLs).
Learning about Zettelkasten over the last few years, it feels like I've been practicing it with todos and building projects, but not as much with 'knowledge'—my notes about the work of others 'slip away' because they are not interconnected and I don't put them in my note taking app. (I'm looking for an app that approximates manual sorting of index cards).
The 'searchable left-list' pattern is quite functional for me, and so I tend to incorporate it into all of my apps in some way. If you're interested to know more, check out my presentation called Wetware of writing and doing, where I also go into how I use Hyperdraft to make things happen.
Hope to hang out here more often as I have more to learn about Zettelkasten and maybe some apps to make 😉.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After learning Haskell for some time, I would say that grasping most libraries and using them to build applications is a doable task, what really puzzles me is how to cultivate the mindset to enable one to build complex libraries. Some examples would be servant (type-level concept), scotty (monad transformer concept), opaleye (profunctor concept), and a lot more. Many Haskell libraries use sophisticated techniques to achieve DSL, but we seem to lack learning materials (the design parts, not the practical usage parts) that are accessible to everyday programmers.

 I have a python setup with lsp, mspyls and company is used in the background for documentation completion (I think). For nearly all Numpy functions, company-show-doc-buffer returns an empty or sometimes wrong buffer. All other functions such as Scipy, built-ins or user-defined work perfectly well. Also, Code completion with company works fine for Numpy which is a bit weird.
 Has anyone encountered this as well? I read somewhere that Numpy added some decorators that might interfere with some APIs, but this also happens for old Numpy packages in a Python 3.5 environment.
 Please help :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is probably a super basic beginner question, but I'm struggling a bit to figure it out. I'm trying to make a simple web app to learn frontend development, and wanted some functionality supporting dropping files into the app, but I can't seem to figure out how to get the literal contents of the file dropped to send it over to Haskell. My Haskell server is set up with Servant, and the Purescript side with Payload, and I'm looking at the documentation for Web.File.File, but the types are all abstract, and I don't see how to get the actual contents of the file. I'm assuming it's stored as a Blob, but there aren't any functions for consuming blobs and Payload can't transmit them.
 So I thought maybe I need to use the Javascript FFI, and was looking at this page, but I see there are quite a few different ways to consume the files, and I'm not sure what the difference is, or what Purescript types they would translate to. I'm assuming the problem isn't actually super complex, but I'm just not quite sure what to try, as I seem to spend the majority of my development time trying to debug issues with the Haskell/Purescript sides communicating with one another, so I'm hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction to avoid wasting any more.
 Basically I'm looking for something File -> ByteString, so that the server can save/retrieve the file for later, without knowing the Purescript equivalent of ByteString.
 Alternatively, I mostly intend to have both the server and application running on the same machine, so if I can get the full filepath then I can just transmit that, and have the server read the file directly, but I can only seem to get the filename, and some googling seems to suggest the directory simply isn't stored in a DragEvent.
 Is there any easy way to do what I'm trying?

 One of the top iPython features I miss when using the python inferior shell in Emacs is the ability to use multi-line commands. python-MLS fills this gap, providing seamless multi-line command editing right at the prompt, with easy copy and paste in or out, a buffer-like editing experience, indentation, optimized fontification, persistent command history, history navigation, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tagged it as AoC since my question came up doing one of those problems but its more of a general question I'd say.... 
 So I learned about Advent of Code and wanted to use it to learn some more Haskell.
 I did the first day, which went well. However I struggle with the second one...
 In theory it shouldn't be too complicated.. My approach was as follows:
  
Read the lines
 Split the lines in 3 different lists (depending in the first character)
 Sum up all values
 ---
  
1.-2. were no problem.
 With 3 I thought I can just use foldl like that 
 foldl (\ p c -> p + read (last c)) 0 testInputf
 where testInputf is a list of Strings ([String]).
 For me it would make sense that c is the whole String and last c is the last element of the String... However this doesn't seem to be the case here... if I write it like that Haskell throws an error saying, that 
  Couldn't match type ‘Char’ with ‘[Char]’ Expected type: [[String]] Actual type: [String] 
 And I can't figure out why... Is there anything Im missing? Is there a general way of getting all last elements out of the Strings in a String List?
 For testing purposes Ive also tried using map 
 map (read . last) testInputf 
 which throws the same error and I can't figure out why...
 Thank you very much!

I can also write a description for it if I want. However, this would link to a complete PDF file, I would like to link to an exact page from that PDF. It doesnt need to be opened in emacs, I write stuff in org but I export as latex then as pdf; so the on Linux qpdfview takes care off that. Anyway, the command to insert the pdf file, if you expand it is:
 [[file:/home/user/someplace/file.pdf][some description]] 
 This would generate a some description and I can click on it (either inside emacs which opens the PDF with Docview or qpdfview if I export it org to pdf). I check this, https://orgmode.org/guide/Hyperlinks.html and tried to change the code to:
 [[file:/home/user/someplace/file.pdf::6][some description]] 
 so that it automatically opens to page 6 of the pdf. This does not seem to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, r/haskell,
 I am working on Chameleon, an experimental visual type debugging tool for Haskell. A couple of months ago I posted an advertisement for a user study for Chameleon. After that post, I was overwhelmed by a very generous amount of participation and constructive feedback from the wholesome r/haskell community. This time I want to conduct the study with more complicated code challenges. Some of the code I took from real-life Haskell projects, such as Cabal, hledger, xmonad,etc.
 If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming research, or you want to check out our Haskell type debugging tool, please click this link to proceed https://sup.ercu.be. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 20 - 30 minutes to complete. But in turn, it will help us immensely.
 I am happy to answer any questions regarding Chameleon in this thread.
 Thank you,
 Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am looking for a way to override faces globally. For example force a face to inherit from another face all of its attributes. And want to avoid doing what i am doing below. What i do right now is something like the block below. But this is annoying. I looked into the Faces Wiki on Emacs found the remapping functionality - https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Face-Remapping.html. But it works just for the current buffer as far as i know. I want to avoid hooks for buffer switches to use the remapping, and preferably have this in my config, execute once, override the faces and be done at that point.
 What I am trying to achieve is force a few packages, which use custom face attributes (i.e helm-rg) to use the default attributes of my theme (i.e make the helm-rg-preview-line-highlight face force inherit/override itself from my mode-line face styles etc.). I am using doom-one theme - https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes (on vanilla emacs, not doom)
 (set-face-attribute 'dst nil ;; This is Just a sample, there are more attributes not specified here :underline 'unspecified :slant 'unspecified :weight 'unspecified :height 'unspecified :family 'unspecified :foreground 'unspecified :background 'unspecified :inherit 'src)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit:
 Based on the comments by u/p3tr4gon, u/psycotica0, I kind of understand how this partially applied type constructor works like.
 My little example use-case:
 type IntMap v = Map.Map Int v --says IntMap is a Map with an Int key and some type v Value --my toy example function to return an IntMap String intMap :: Int -> String -> IntMap String intMap num str = Map.singleton num str --and from the original question this also worked someAssocList = [(1, "John"), (2, "Lisa"), (3, "Mary"), (4, "Sandra")] myIntMap = Map.fromList someAssocList :: IntMap String --------------------------------------------------------------------- --ghci output below Prelude> :r [1 of 1] Compiling Shapes ( ch8_types.hs, interpreted ) Ok, one module loaded. *Shapes> intMap 2 "Noah" fromList [(2,"Noah")] *Shapes> myIntMap fromList [(1,"Noah"),(2,"Lisa"),(3,"Mary"),(4,"Sandra")] 
 And I agree that this is a toy example that probably does not have many use cases.
 Original question:
 In Learn You a Haskell 8.5, they have this example
 --partially apply type constructor type IntMap v = Map.Map Int v type IntMap' = Map.Map Int 
 How would I use this? I only know how to make a so-called IntMap like this
 import qualified Data.Map as Map someAssocList = [(1, "John"), (2, "Lisa"), (3, "Mary"), (4, "Sandra")] myIntMap = Map.fromList someAssocList --deleted due to typo please see edits above

Digging a little I see that org-return will only call org-open-at-point if (org-return-follows-link is non-nil and) calling (org-element-context) would yield something of the form "(link (:type...". Since calling (org-element-context) yields something like "(citation-reference...", org-open-at-point is never called when point is on a citation and I call org-return. 
 So... any easy way to do this, short of redefining org-return? (Or better, perhaps, to write a wrapper that will call org-open-at-point when point is on a citation and call org-return otherwise?) It seems to me that it would be convenient to have citations treated much like file:// expressions, but maybe there's a reason for not doing this?

I see org-babel-execute-buffer, but how do you make sure it's off? I think the default behavior is already not auto-evaluating the blocks, isn't it, so I don't need to worry. So yes, how do you definitively control the org-babel-execute-buffer behavior on or off? It seems though, that an export to HTML etc. does try to run evaluate all blocks. How can that be turned off?

I get *invalid* in the mode-line and the CPU total usage is instead displayed in the minibuffer. Also it does create a *Shell Command Output* buffer. That buffer is not desired. 
 Im aware that I need setq-default but for the purpose of testing I use with only setq. I test in the scratch buffer. Before someone comes and ask why? And say "Emacs is a text editor!" I run EXWM and I need the CPU/MEM total usage to be displayed all the time. I've been looking for a package that would display these info rather in the mode-line or in the systray. I've found nothing :( However, I did find a package that does display these info in the minibuffer. The minibuffer is not the best place for this tho. Also that package was making my Emacs slow af. Dont ask for the name of the package, I dont recall. Plus, I dont want to hit on someone else work. I cant even write this function alone, so ya. 
 So if you want to help, please do and thank you :) Also, Im pretty sure this little function could be appreciated by other Emacs users. 
 Here's what I came with so far for the CPU:
 (defun cpu-usage-3 () "Display CPU Usage" (shell-command "ps -A -o pcpu | tail -n+2 | paste -sd+ | bc")) ;; Found that ps command line on the internet. I did not create that. (setq mode-line-format (list '(:eval (cpu-usage-3))))

a week before the training I need to order materials and exams
 the day before I need to set up the online whiteboard
 the day of the training, I need to conduct the training (and would like this to be reflected by a due date)
 one day after the training, I want to send a link to a feedback form
  
You get the gist.
 I'm wondering if there's a way to set up a capture template so that I enter "Training on subject X, on date Y", and org will automatically calculate the corresponding due dates for these surrounding activities and stick them into the newly captured structure.
 Any suggestions on how to accomplish this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've started working on performance of the venerable but somewhat neglected pqueue package. The changes I've made so far are pretty obviously good, and make a big difference in even the most informal testing. But to make decisions about smaller points, I really need benchmarks, and the package has none. Does anyone know of a benchmark suite for priority queues? One that includes algorithms that involve persistent queue use would be particularly desirable, but I'll take anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was musing about the following:
  
Would a language version*, where 'in the case of a newtype everything (that's derivable, including with language extensions, like GeneralizedNewTypeDeriving) is automatically derived, unless a manual derivation or a manual instance is defined (or manually suppressed, with a new syntax)' be more ergonomic?
  
I was thinking about this, because I noticed that with quick problems I was often reaching for type instead of newtype. The latter would afford more type safety, but even manually adding the relevant deriving ... clauses felt like a chore for the Advent of Code problems.
  
*) I don't pretend that would still necessarily fall under Haskell2010 + a new extension; maybe this would need to be a hypothetical Haskell derivative, because of semantic changes down the line.
  
Would this even be viable? Would there be undesirable consequences? Would it indeed improve ergonomics, or was that stray thought just a wrong impression?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love emacs as a text editor for programming. But I am trying to build a GTD system using emacs orgmode and calendar and the search lists and calendar displays on emacs always end up looking like a nightmarish wall of text that makes looking at them a pain, a bit too information-dense, making it hard to focus on things. My eyes just bounce around the screen without focusing on anything.
 Is there a way to build similar calendar and search screens on emacs that have instead a lot of white space and separation between items, and focusing in readability rather than on information density?
 I basically would like more structure and less text on screen.
 Some examples:
  
http://doc.norang.ca/block-agenda-nonproject.png
  
This is a task list, but it just presents line after the other of tasks with very little structure and forces you to read through everything to find things rather than having more structure and less crowded text.
  
https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/x2h2YKongReYZpjadF36L0fvICHhm0fZG4keZZlYmapLUzfpBHuIIBwgLu1AaCTSFmUhbneZ946iOxm60HFIpcrzEr5otlWbvHM5uDmE9OlTN9n4Q__2A6Obq28
  
Very crowded week-calenday-view with the tasks of one day just piling on top of the tasks of the next day and making it hard to get a clear, temporal view of the view.
 I haven't been able to find any examples with more readable and less crowded views. Has anybody built anything like this? Or is emacs the wrong tool for this and maybe more centered for users that like to see a lot of information at once rather than more structured information? I realize it may be difficult to do what other task and calendar applications do with pure text, so I may be looking at the wrong tool.

It still works for the example input tho! :)

 It was simple enough to hide the overdue stuff from today's timeline:
  (agenda "" ((org-agenda-overriding-header " ") ;; Non-empty string to get empty line (org-agenda-span 'day) (org-agenda-ndays 1) (org-agenda-sorting-strategy (quote ((agenda time-up priority-down tag-up)))) ;; Do not include scheduled, due or overdue items here (org-deadline-warning-days 0) (org-scheduled-past-days 0) (org-deadline-past-days 0) (org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t) (org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-done t) (org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t))) 
 But I cannot get that output to appear elsewhere, e.g. farther down, out of focus. This does display all overdue etc. taks, but also everything with a timestamp for today:
  (agenda "" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Overdue") (org-agenda-time-grid nil) (org org-agenda-remove-timeranges-from-blocks t) (org-agenda-show-all-dates nil) (org-agenda-format-date "") ;; Skip the date (org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil) (org-agenda-span 'day) (org-agenda-ndays 0) (org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done)) ;; Show overdue items (org-scheduled-past-days 999) (org-deadline-past-days 999) ;; Ignore upcoming deadlines (org-deadline-warning-days 0))) 
 How can I get the bottom part to only show overdue etc. tasks, not those that are scheduled for today? 
 Do I have to write a (org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done)) replacement in elisp that filters elements by date, i.e. "not today"? (How? :))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all.
 I have some text with selected phrases marked within asterisks ("*") because org-mode syntax helps to visualize them inside the text, and I'd like to extract those phrases to another buffer.
 As I understand after some searching, one way is to use occur.
 However, I'm struggling (to say it lightly) to find a working regex for this occurrence that is "whatever is between asterisks". I tried txt2regex but no success still...
 Does anyone knows a way to do this; or been in this situation and found a different approach? My lisp/regex fu is very much near the bottom, but I'm happy to learn.
 As always, thanks a lot for your time and attention. :)
 Best regards...
 ​
 PD: I'm thinking about ways to do semantic analysis with org-mode. If anyone's interested on this we can arrange some collaboration. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using Emacs for many years. Thanks to the fantastic introduction to ELisp, I knew enough to "configure" Emacs. For some reason only recently have I started actually thinking about how I can make my computer-life easier; and Emacs is the one tool which poses least resistence when I try to. 
 I am kinda mad at myself for not doing this sooner, but also very happy that I finally did. I didn't know where else to share this :-)
 In last few days, I have written 2 small bits of Elisp code (which took me embarassingly long to write, but the exercise was very rewarding).
  
First was publishing org subtrees as github issues; so I can stay in org-mode where I am very comfortable thinking and documenting my thoughts, and also push them to Github for colleagues. I can mark an issue as "DONE" and it closes the github issue, or change its content, or labels. 
 And a few minutes ago I wrote a little code to insert my org-roam notes as rust documentation comments
  
It's not much, but it is honest work and I am happy I am finally doing it.

 And even if you have a good answer to the first question, why is there no variable that makes it possible to activate the behaviour 99% of users would except?
 I think naming funktions "org-<key>" is a horrible design, and that is mostly unique for org-mode I know no other package that does that, so it's breaking standard coding practises in emacs, but then also add such bad defaults and no way to configure it in a sane way drives me insane.
 It's a enourmous effort to not use standard keys, but please I am not willing to press some finger destroying C-c C-o, my health is to important to me to want that, and in no case I ever want to behave <return> to jump to the next line when the cursor is on a link. Does really somebody want this behaviour this way? You prefer pressing C-c C-o over <return>?
 Sorry for the rant, I need to make some tea... cheers.
 org-return-follows-link is set to <t> in this example btw, so normally return would open the link, just not in a table.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to investigate text log files a lot. Emacs with auto-revert-tail-mode does the job almost fine, except when there are long lines (JSON/XML dumps, 1-40kb large).
 In that case Emacs lags a lot.
 I use fundamental-mode + add few font-lock-add-keywords by (highlighting for INFO/DEBUG/ERROR & for date/time):
 http://hg.defun.work/dot-emacs/file/tip/mylisp/log4-hi-mode.el
 Even with plain fundamental-mode Emacs is unresponsible. I tried debug on error on C-g and the stacktrace is only native rendering function redisplay_internal.
 Just writing the post I tried so-long-mode instead of fundamental-mode and it is much better but still noticeably lagging. Few extra font-lock-add-keywords in so-long-mode doesn't have huge impact: movement is just a bit slower than without.
 I don't like to open Notepad++ just for log files, though it might be the proper solution...
 Any suggestions on debugging long line issue?
 Could we expect Emacs rendering of long lines improved? 
 I'm with Cygwin Emacs W32 27.2. Almost the same situation with Emacs 27.1 in WSL1 terminal. so-long-mode provides better experience, few font-lock-add-keywords ruin smoothness of movement.
 UPDATE I really need some highlighting for log files (date/time + INFO/DEBUG/ERROR): I expect some help from the tool.

 As the title says, I'm trying to move to Emacs 28, from Emacs 27, but I'm having all kinds of weird problems with the packages I use.
 This is my config BTW: https://github.com/croqaz/dotfiles/blob/main/emacs/Emacs.org
 Basically I have "random errors" with random packages.
 First there's IVY and the suite of packages, the error is:
 custom-initialize-reset: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, ../../../../../../.emacs.default/straight/build/ivy/ivy
 I comment ivy, counsel, swiper, ivy-rich, then I get the same error about another package. I comment it and I get another error, etc until I comment: centaur-tabs, doom-modeline, dimmer, which-key, maybe a few more.
 Then I delete ~/.emacs.default/straight/build/ivy and re-enable ivy AND move it immediately after use-package initialization and now it works!
 Then I re-enable all of them, one by one until they all work again!
 It's like one package in there is causing some problems and makes all the other packages after it, to go crazy, that's why I have to move them higher to make it work.
 I tried this so so so many times, that I made it work, but it's a huge pain!
 Anybody else that understands the new version, that can help me?
 Thank you in advance!
 EDIT 1: Other than the problem with packages that I just mentioned, upgrading from Emacs 27 to 28 was painless.
 EDIT 2: Actually I also had the same trouble with yasnippet, company, js2, typescript and LSP packages...

That's all well and good when the thing we're interested in is the return value(s) of the snippet, but I've been looking to try & get the standard output written into the results too, or in a similar block maybe labelled as +#OUTPUT:.
 Does anyone know how this might be done? I suspect there must be some kind of option passed in the +#BEGIN_SRC CLOJURE line, but I haven't been able to find out what it should be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello again,
 I have a custom keyboard shortcut for moving quicker in VIM (for Emacs I use EVIL) where I hold down CTRL and press HJKL I move faster in the direction.
 Like this:
 ;; Movement changes - BUG: When I release CTRL it still does one last 5 line jump when pressing one of my keys (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-h") (kbd "h5")) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-j") (kbd "j5")) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-k") (kbd "k5")) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-l") (kbd "l5")) 
 However, in EMACS when I use this, it does work. But once I let go off CTRL it does ONE last 5 jump, despite that it should have stopped. It also feels a bit like there is a small delay when doing this.
 Does anyone know a possible solution for this to make it more responsive and NOT have a "last" jump after letting CTRL go.
 Thanks in advance.

 I'm back with some more question for my quest to move over to emacs. This time it's only about HELM (there will be more questions I'm sure of it), but this thread is only for HELM. 
 I have a couple of question I'd love to get some help with. I've tried googling for them, but only found answers that didn't really answer the question, or I couldn't actually understand how the answer worked. :(
  
Is there a way to make helm-find-file to also look in sub-directories? When I googled for this, most people suggested Projectile with helm, but I could not get that working at all. There was no error or such, but it did not search in sub-directories. 
 
Is there anyway to make helm open a new window (or frame, not sure what it is called in emacs) at the center of the screen? There was some old questions here on this reddit for it, but they were 5 years old and then it seems like it wasn't possible. However, I saw on the official documentation that it should be possible. I just can't get it to work for me. I tried using Shackle to solve it as well, and that improved it, but still does not feel as good. 
 
 I believe that was my two helm questions I was mostly struggling with. 
 Thanks in advance

 I want to go through a specific category and want to get those in one single buffer (search or otherwise) with the contents.
 So let's say I have a category country, I want to revisit all the details under this category.
 I am using spacemacs and projectile. A project search or org-roam-find usually lets me search the header but doesn't say whats in the content.
 Options I know of - 
  
Creating an index of country headers and creating its own org-id for org-roam and visiting them manually
 
org-transclusion, where I could include all the same categories in one buffer and that would let me explore the content.
 
 What I am looking for specifically is something that would not require me to make changes like above which would require creating org id for categories which I can use in a buffer. I want a simple approach where a search query would give me what I am looking for in a separate buffer.
 Thanks in advance!

 I was using Emacs to edit some code for an upcoming deadline, I fat fingered something, Emacs exited to terminal. Usually this would be fine, I'd lost a few minutes of work, BUT it appears the files were rolled back to near when I started the Emacs session that terminated (multiple hours)
 I saved tens of times during the session, but nevertheless all my work appears to be gone. Of course it was as I was about to make a commit and push.
 I would really appreciate any insight into what could have possibly happened. My best guess is a shortcut for `git reset --hard`, but even my GitHub repo is more up to date than my local files now (but still at least an hour behind).
 With or without knowing what happened, is there a way to get these files back? Any help would be obviously be appreciated.
 Edit: change first line status to solved

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there guys.
 So, I've recently got the source for Emacs 28.0.90 from https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git and built and installed it following the instructions. More specifically, I ran the following:
  
./autogen.sh
 /configure --with-native-compilation=yes --with-json=yes --with-gnutls=yes --with-x-toolkit=lucid --with-mailutils=yes --with-rsvg=yes
 make -j4
 sudo make install
  
The compilation and install were successful, as well as the Doom install. However when I try to run Emacs I get the following error message:
 error: Invalid hash table rehash size, 1.0
 When I try to run an Emacs client (after successfully starting a daemon) I get a more elaborate error message:
 *ERROR*: Error in a Doom startup hook: server-after-make-frame-hook, doom-init-theme-h, (error "Invalid hash table rehash size" 1.0)
 The same happens when build and install Emacs 27.2 (source also from Savannah), without, of course, the native compilation flag on configure.
 I saw that some Spacemacs users ran into the same problem and submitted this issue. I tried, as suggested there, to run an apt upgrade, but had no success.
 Btw, I'm using Ubuntu 20 and Emacs works fine in the terminal.
 Has anyone ran into the same issue? How can I fix this? 
 Thanks in advance!

 I installed the ts-ls server without issue, and it runs just fine on *.ts files, but it's also running for *.js files. Even stranger is that eslint is running at the same time! Now that both of them are running at the same time for a single file, syntax highlighting doesn't work (although I get warnings and errors underlined as I expect). How do I configure this so that I don't have both running?

So in reverse order, here's mine:

Memory Maintenance
Considering notes as proxies for memories, as the size and matrix of the archive grows, more time is spent maintaining existing notes. New notes should be created with abandon. Integrating them into the archive as wholly as I do. Editing them with abandon.
My new note-taking/zettelkasting mantra is: Create and edit with abandon. Trust that magic will happen.

  
I realized that in a few months, let alone years, at this rate most of my time would be spent on the maintenance of memories [notes]. I, as others have found, would be too busy maintaining these memories to use them. 1


What does it mean to "use" a memory? I can use a note's contents, and its idea can be reignited in me. It can spark new and novel ideas.

Would this be accurate? And then the combinatorics product rule also seems at play here. I would appreciate any theoretical explanation of what a list comprehension is about.
 Edit: Looking at the Report I can see and understand the details, but somehow that list of facts in the "Translations" box implies, results in the Cartesian product. I'd like to know how and why.

 What I want to ask this community is that how many of you use Scala especially to build microservices using Play Framework... I feel like diving super deep into it but I plan to learn typescript as well... Now I know typescript is definitely a big game player but Scala is something I have been enjoying a bit...
 Is it worth learning Scala in 2022 or should I go with something like golang or Rust? I know it depends on what things I am dealing with but in that scenario javascript and python are answer to almost all my questions Unless performance walks in and now even modern optimized frameworks are handling that well too.
 As a developer, keeping all your love and affection for Java based languages aside do you think it's worth investing in Scala and Play Framework?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear r/scala,
 I am a big fan of SBT that is my main tools for debuging while coding. However, sometimes I can have like 30 errors at once. It is required to debug from first to last since the last errors may be consequent to the firsts one. In this case I have to scroll back to find the start of the error thread which I feel is a lost of time. 
 Do you know a way to reverse this error thread, so that the first errors are shown at the bottom? Or to limit the number of errors shown?
 ​
 Thx

 I visit a dired buffer, all details are hidden as per my config, but after 3 seconds or so, it suddenly shows all my details. Pressing 'g' reverts it to the original setup, only to get overridden again after 3 seconds. I've singled it down to bookmarks+, since de-installation removes this bug.
 I'm posting it in this sub-reddit, since I couldn't find a github for bookmarks+.

 Doom, for some reason isn't replicating this functionality. I see that in my JS file it's using rjsx-indent-line as the indent function, and when I call that via elisp, I see the expected behavior, but when I repeatedly press tab, the line indents further than it should.
 Anybody know how to turn that off?

It is clear that the language servers know about them, because they are able to properly find and import them, but i would like to be able to explicitly search for them by name (like C-x C-f).
 Is there a generic lsp feature / is that part of the spec , or each server is different in that aspect. Any help is appreciated, thanks !
 Another additional question - how does the language server access those symbols, say the Java language server, is it doing that through maven's m2 repository or does it keep a stash on its own.

 been trying to solve this issue for quite a while now (google, posts). I swear, I did everything short of asking it here.
 Different terminal emulators as well (Terminal, iTerm2, kitty). I am on macOS.
 I would love to use my arrow keys in the non gui version of Emacs but they seem to be weirdly mapped:
 ​
 UP:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then A
 (GUI Emacs: evil-previous-line)
 
 Down:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then B
 (GUI Emacs: evil-next-line)
 
 Right:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then C
 (GUI Emacs: evil-forward-char)
 
 Left:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then C
 (GUI Emacs: evil-backward-char)
 ​
 ​
 I have tried few remapping by suggestions that do not work at all – currently:
 ​
 (unless (display-graphic-p)
 (progn
 (defvar arrow-keys-map (make-sparse-keymap) "Keymap for arrow keys")
 (define-key esc-map "O" arrow-keys-map)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map "A" 'previous-line)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map "B" 'next-line)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map "C" 'forward-char)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map "D" 'backward-char)))
 ​
 Nope. Doesn't work.
 HELP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I'm trying to switch (once again, 2nd try) from my tmux, vim setup, to emacs. Mostly because I do common lisp development, but I have 2 relative big issues regarding my workflow. First, on every project I have a script that builds tmux session with corresponding services running (redis, postgresdb, vim, custom services, etc) I guess I can simulate this using a elisp file on each project? Is that possible? . Second, I use a lot M-x compile command, but my root keeps moving on each window. It's different than vim, that the root is where I executed vim. On the other hand, SLIME is really cool, and I'm really eager to use org-mode more when I solve this 2 issues. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[File links break all the time, for instance after reorganize your directory structure. This can take many time to fix broken link manually. I need a solution to prevent all file reference in my org-agenda-files are broken.
 My current solution to prevent the issue is to use hardlink in org-agenda-files ```
 assume I want add /a/b/c.org into emacs variable org-agenda-files
 mkdir ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files
 create hardlink of c.org in dir org-agenda-files
 ln /a/b/c.org ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org 
 add ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org to emacs variable org-agenda-files
 ```
 However, this solution has some limit. For instance, - the absolute path of "c.org" become ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org. So its relative link are broken.
 LinkTek propose a much better solution: https://linktek.com/do-this-one-trick-and-never-worry-about-broken-file-links-again/
  
LinkTek creates an additional association between the parent file and each of its child files. LinkFixer Advanced uses that secondary association to quickly and automatically fix all the links that get broken by whatever changes someone makes to your files.
  
What solution you use for the problem of broken link? Exist an implementation of solution proposed by LinkTek for org mode?

 I am running it under -Q and the process go up and down at around 30/40% of a single core on a non beefy laptop even idled with no buffer open.
 I am guessing this is inherent on how wayland protocol works where emacs+pgtk spend its time doing the redrawing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by recent, well-known articles on Embark and on Avy, I've started testing Embark over the past few days - and it's already turning into the interface I always wanted and only sort of knew I needed. While it's extremely useful out-of-the-box, I've already found a few cases where I would want to use it but can't, because it doesn't understand the construct at point. Examples:
  
Org mode timestamps - to provide operations like activate/inactivate, change, pop calendar to that date, bump by repeater, etc.
 
Org mode headlines - pretty much everything you can do on those, that Org mode has bound to countless weird keys. Including "speed commands", most of which could work without quitting the Embark "prompter", the way e.g. navigating to next/prev symbol works.
 
Org mode tables - embark-cycle could be able to switch between cell, row, column, whole table (perhaps also stopping at "rowgroup", "column group" and "subtable", which would be rectangular areas that are bound by hlines and column group markers) - each of those would have its own contextual commands available. For example, "eval formula", so one doesn't have to remember reference syntax and how many times to press C-u before pressing C-c =.
 
Syntactic elements and expressions in programming language modes, allowing for e.g. language-specific actions.
 
 From the looks of it, it's not that hard to write any - the tricky bit being target classifiers. I'm going to take a stab at adding some classifiers and action keymaps for things I commonly interact with - but I'd like to avoid repeating work that might already be done better. Hence my question: are there any "extension packages" that enable Embark to recognize more target types? Or, are any of you already using hand-written ones (and if yes, can you share them)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have all seen Emacs be described as so many different things: a text editor, not just a text editor, an operating system, a Lisp interpreter, and a *million other things.
 Describing what Emacs is can be super difficult, as it is different things to different people. Some use it for programming or general writing, some for organisation, project management, email, web browsing, controlling media, and a **million more things. Basically, people use Emacs for whatever they want, which is fantastic! 
 This makes it difficult to describe what exactly Emacs is to people outside our friendly little circle. Other editors can be described nearly completely with a short familiar phrase. Vim is an efficient text editor, VSCode is a powerful modern IDE, Vi is a last resort. But Emacs doesn't have a consistent and universally agreeable short description. 
 My question is, what is Emacs to you? How would you describe it succinctly to someone who has heard about it, but not sure what all the fuss is about? 
 My humble submission would be: "the whatever you want text interface."
 *Mild exaggeration, but you get the picture

 I found out about emacs some months back. When I initially tried out emacs; it felt complicated to use. After I practiced emacs over time; I started to like emacs.
  
I could use lynx inside emacs to form a psuedomultitab browser. Eventually I learned that emacs has a built-in browser eww. I favored that browser over lynx.
 
It was nice to be able to containerize workspaces, like for programming, school work, miscellaneous stuff, and just general browsing without having to deal with floating windows.
 
 I have Autism and ADHD; emacs helps with dealing with Autism, because it does not give much lack of sensory information; emacs is hyperresponsive, unlike VSCode, so it does not hurt my eyes when I try to do heavy-load tasks.
 emacs also helps with ADHD, since I can easily organize stuff with org-mode. I can also easily navigate buffers without a pointing device; I am uncomfortable with pointing devices (mouses and touchpads), despite using them for 11 years. Pointing devices seem to really mess with me and I can't control them as well (as I can with a keyboard).
 EDIT: My only complaint is that I wish I could display images in CLI emacs, like running viu on links to images after eww finishes loading. That complaint is not a criticism on emacs itself though.

But when doing Jinja/Django specific syntax(for example in an HTML file), the auto-completion does not work? Is there an lsp-mode/eglot-mode for this to be used with use-package?
 If not then is there a way to declare web-mode in a use-package, where this functionality can be set, in which the corresponding Jinja/Django engine is activated based on a corresponding hook?
 I'd prefer to stick with the .py and .html extensions, but if that's not possible, the I could try out extensions like .djhtml to be used in the web-mode hook in the declared use-package.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use ebib and citar. Both are awesome, but have different defaults when creating notes files for bibliographic entries. I wanted to unify them (so that my notes would always be of the same format). So I defined a wrapper function:
 (defun my/citar-ebib-notes-format-wrapper (key _entry _filepath) "Wrapper so that citar's notes function can inherit from ebib's. 
 Passes KEY to ebib--notes-fill-template', along with the value ofebib--cur-db' if defined, or the first item of `ebib-preload-bib-files' if not. _ENTRY and _FILEPATH are ignored." (require 'ebib-notes) (if-let ((cell (ebib--notes-create-new-note key (or ebib--cur-db (car ebib-preload-bib-files))))) (progn (display-buffer (car cell)) (goto-char (cdr cell)))))
 This only works while ebib is running. While it's not running I get an error message format-spec: Invalid format character: ‘%T, which is strange, because the formatting seems to rely on ebib-notes-template-specifiers, which I don't change, and which is initialised in ebib-notes.el (so should be available when the body of the function runs). Changing the notes template variable so that it doesn't include %T helps, and iterating on this reveals that the formatter errors for all specifiers except %K, which it handles fine. I'm very confused.
 I've tried everything I can think of to get this to work, to no avail. What's going on? Any help greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just today I startted getting the following errors after using straight to pull the most recent version of org.
 Error (use-package): org/:config: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-element-cache-reset [2 times]
 Error (use-package): evil-embrace/:catch: Symbol’s value as variable is void: org-org-menu
 WARNING: No org-loaddefs.el file could be found from where org.el is loaded.
 You need to run "make" or "make autoloads" from Org lisp directory
 The only notable parts of my config related to installing org are as follows:
 (require 'package) (setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("nongnu" . "https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/"))) 
 and
 (straight-use-package 'org) (straight-use-package '(org-contrib :type git :host github :repo "emacsmirror/org-contrib")) 
 I Know there have been some recent changes with org mode installation and I have seen some posts here but I have gotten confused and can't seem to figure out what I am doing wrong. Notably, I have not changed anything in my config lately that I would imaging would have anything to do with installing org....
 ​
 EDIT: I take it back. 
 I did recently add 
 :hook (org-mode . turn-on-org-cdlatex)
 and removing that line does seem to fix things but I have no idea why. 
 Any help would be most appreciated.

 What does it mean when I start its daemon:

 I also feel that ~/.emacs.d/init.el isn't executed when I start the emacs, because I added (desktop-save-mode 1) in it, and when I exit and start emacs daemon again, it doesn't reopen the files that were opened when I exited it.

 I have defined succ so that it can be applied to all permutation of [Letters] with a ordered sequence like this:
 succ [A,A,A] = [A,A,B] succ [A,A,B] = [A,A,C] succ [A,A,C] = [A,B,A] ... succ [C,C,B] = [C,C,C] -- succ [C,C,C] is not defined 
 build in Buildable is given the start and end value, it builds a ordered list of every element in the set including start and end:
 build A B = [A,B] build B C = [B,C] build A C = [A,B,C] 
 ​
 How do I apply Buildable on [Letters] such that I can call build like this:
 build [A] [B] = [[A],[B]] build [A,A] [B,B] = [[A,A],[A,B],[B,A],[B,B]] build [A,A,A] [A,A,C] = [[A,A,A],[A,A,B],[A,A,C]] build [B,B,C] [B,C,C] = [[B,B,C],[B,C,A],[B,C,B],[B,C,C]] 
 It seems like I have to define what maxBound and minBound is for [Letters] if I do instance Buildable [a]. How do I do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use dired with the variable delete-by-moving-to-trash set to t. But sometimes I want to delete a file (or directory) without sending it to trash. Here is how I modified the dired-deletion-commands to toggle their trashing-behavior when called with a prefix.
 (defun my/dired-do-flagged-delete (&optional arg) (interactive "P") (let ((delete-by-moving-to-trash (xor arg delete-by-moving-to-trash))) (dired-do-flagged-delete))) (defun my/dired-do-delete (&optional arg) (interactive "P") (let ((delete-by-moving-to-trash (xor arg delete-by-moving-to-trash))) (dired-do-delete))) 
 All I have to do now is bind these functions to x and D in dired-mode-map
 Of course after that, the default reaction to prefixes is lost. Personally I don't care, because I never used it. Others might think differently about that.

 Should I be using stack to make Haskell projects? stack wasn't included in the haskell-platform download so is there a different workflow I should be using? I have some projects on github that I made with stack.
 Any help or other new advice would be nice

 M-: (setq show-trailing-whitespace t) RET M-: (setq-default show-trailing-whitespace t) RET 
 Then typed 3 lines in the .txt buffer where every line contains a trailing whitespace. The trailing whitespaces do not get highlighted.
 I also checked C-h o trailing-whitespace RET and it shows that this face is set to black foreground on red background. Still I don't see the trailing spaces highlighted in this manner.
 What is going on and how to fix it?

I use these commands quite often, and if I had not rebound them, they would be literally the only reason I ever hit the arrow keys.
 Is there a rationale behind this?

 Warning: This package indirectly depends on multiple versions of the same package. This is very likely to cause a compile failure. package ghc (ghc-8.10.7) requires ghci-8.10.7 package clash-ghc (clash-ghc-1.4.6) requires ghci-8.10.7-G6m9jPL8HBD2MenaVWt4To 
 Then later there are a few errors that indicate that this warning is indeed the problem.
 How can I fix this? I could give up on the nixification of the project and just use stack, but I'd prefer not to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title may not be the appropriate way of solving this issue but I feel it may be a way to the solution.
 I have a function that takes in something and returns a list of that something changed in multiple ways.
 The way it is changed is by checking the input against many if statements, the if statements only differ by the fact the values within them increment up and down. However, I don't think this is a good solution to this.
 The way that it is changed shows a pattern so I think I should be able to solve it recursively but I can't figure out how.
 I will give an example of a situation similar to mine, this function is useless and is just an arbitrary example of my situation:
 function :: Shape -> [Shape]
 function shape@(Triangle sidea sideb sidec) =
  [if length sidec <= (7) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (2) then changeSideC shape (2) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec <= (6) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (3) then changeSideC shape(3) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec <= (5) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (4) then changeSideC shape (4) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec <= (4) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (5) then changeSideC shape (5) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec <= (3) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (6) then changeSideC shape (6) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec <= (2) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (7) then changeSideC shape (7) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec <= (1) && sidecChangeable sideb sidea (8) then changeSideC shape (8) else Triangle [][][]]
 I have put the recurring pattern in brackets so you can see what I am talking about. How would I reduce this function down so that it would work even if you made the numbers much larger? Is there a recursive way of doing this?
 I feel that this is possible but I am at a loss on how to implement this.
 This is my first post so go easy on me if I'm missing something.

 I am a PhD student in Earth Sciences currently trying to switch all my Python programming from Spyder to emacs (because emacs is just all I need). 
 I am pretty sure more people than enough tried to make emacs as close as Spyder for me to find somewhere an el file ready to use with the Spyder theme and just the few useful things I need (basically an iPython console in another window, autocompletion, black formatting on save, cell highlighting and few other things)... However I can't find anything. Thefore I'm pretty sure I am not looking at the right places. Do you know where I could find such a file? Or at least part of it (like the spyder theme)?
 Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

 All dependencies, including libgccjit, are bundled into Emacs.app, and have been tested to work with native compilation on fresh macOS VMs with nothing installed except Xcode Command Line Tools.
 Native Apple Silicon builds are not yet available, and depend on GitHub-hosted Action runners adding Apple Silicon hardware. See Issue #4 for details. But the Intel-based builds have been reported to work fine on Apple Silicon via Rosetta2.

 // top level object Extractors(using Quotes): import quotes.reflect._ object OnTerm: def unapply(expr: Expr[_]): Option[Term] = Some(expr.asTerm) 
 But this fails to parse with objects cannot have parameters. Dotty compiler quotes module has constructions like

 I wish to remove the gray inline requests and only keep the light-bulb requests on the right. I have looked through this page: https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/how-to-turn-off/ but I cannot find out how to remove the inline requests. Any help with this is greatly appreciated. I have also noticed that the inline requests are actually duplicated, which is even more confusing. 
 For the high memory usage, I don't even know where to begin with reducing it. It's so high that it completely eclipses the memory usage of the rest of Emacs.

I love emacs but there is one feature that makes me open up Pycharm every day instead and that is its “sciview”, which displays dataframes in a “spreadsheet” manner which really helps when debugging/exploring.
 EIN has a function to do exactly this and visualize the dataframe in SES mode: https://github.com/tkf/emacs-ipython-notebook/blob/d62dc59869d436385efa940ba20a737bb8b9e5fd/lisp/ein-pytools.el#L222 . It relies on a jupyter kernel to retrieve the data, I would like to adapt that to dap-mode (or any standard python process accessible through a REPL) but my elisp-fu is way too poor.
 Has anybody here solved this problem before?

 So then, my question would be, how would link a cider session? My guess is that the (cider-completion-get-context) value isn't returning the cider session.

 Is there a way to make lsp-ui-doc display documentation in the same way it does in the first case, everywhere? Sorry if this has been asked before, I couldn't find anything about it while googling. Here is my settings file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to know what you people do in these situations.
 Namely, I'd like to have coherent and consistent keybindings accross different modes, and I'd like to have this information quite visible in one place so that I can generally decide for all prog-modes or text modes what are the best keybindings for me.
 Right now I have defined a macro that kind of does this for me, a minimal example for markup languages would be
 emacs-lisp (defcustom ale-markup-mode-maps '(:org org-mode-map :latex latex-mode-map :tex TeX-mode-map :md markdown-mode-map) "Maps to be added to the markup ale mode" :group 'ale) 
 Here I define in a plist the maps that I am interested in and the keyword is important. Later I can define the keybindings and I can override the functions for different maps according to the keywords I defined in the plist above.
 ```emacs-lisp (ale-define-key normal ale-markup-mode-maps "C-i" (:md markdown-cycle :all org-cycle) ;; images "C-c C-i C-l" org-latex-preview "C-c C-i C-t" (:all org-toggle-inline-images :md markdown-toggle-inline-images) "C-c C-i C-i" #'org-redisplay-inline-images
 ;; references "C-c C-r C-d" papis-extract-citations-into-dblock "C-c C-r C-i" papis-org-ref-insert-citation-from-query "C-c C-r C-o" (:all org-ref-insert-cite-link :tex reftex-citation :latex reftex-citation) "C-c C-r C-r" (:all org-ref-insert-ref-link :tex reftex-label :latex reftex-label)) ```
 How would you do this, is there a canonical way of doing this that I am missing out?
 Just to be clear, I don't mean defining a minor mode where to have a set of keybindings, because the keybinding will be different depending on the mode that I'm in, but if I'm in org or markdown I want semantically =C-i= to mean cycling, but the function is different.
 Thanks people!

 I've done a bit of googling and I can't seem to find an exact answer on what this is, or what's causing it. For reference, here's my exact setup:

 Is there some way to set this in the file's Org headers instead?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Like I've written in another post about Omnisharp and LSP, I'm back to trying to use Emacs as my main GUI. This is for notes, coding, etc. The reason I want to use Emacs is that I haven't found a good GUI for nvim for Windows and I sadly have to be on Windows for my daily work. This is where Emacs comes in. I'm setting up Emacs to be close to VIM (but not using SpaceMacs or DoomEmacs since they are incredibly slow on Windows, especially compared to "Vanilla Emacs"), with EVIL and some other helping functions. I have some beginner questions I'd love to get help with to be happy inside of Emacs. 
 1. How can I make my .emacs file a bit cleaner instead of doing this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find Haskell an amazing language but I have difficulties integrating it into my daily workflow. I work as a professional programmer and do Python all day long.
 I started the "Learn you a Haskell" book to tease my brain and learn to approach problems from a different angle. And I have learned a lot and I think my Python code has benefited from it.
 But I got stuck at the Monad chapter and lost interest. But it's still in the back of my mind to get back to it.
 However, the biggest roadblock I am facing is that I can't seem to find something useful to do with Haskell. Probably due to the lack of my knowledge/experience in that language.
 But I can't bring myself to write Haskell at work as I would be the only one being able to maintain the code (no other Haskellers around).
 So I am turning to you folks: Do you have any ideas of writing something that will end up being something useful? Maybe some starters for implementing a HTTP/REST layer between a JS-Frontend and a database? Or something else I would love to play around with (but I'm not sure whether it's even possible): Writing a Python extension in Haskell, or, if that's not doable, a .so shared library which could be called from other code so I could use Python's ctypes module (not sure if that is even possible either).
 Any ideas? Tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I did my own research, I found that lsp-mode seemed to have eclipsed eglot and that it was close to the de facto LSP client for emacs. Recently, however, I have met quite a few developers that I respect who are using eglot and say that it is less buggy than lsp-mode.
 I have found that many of the bugs I have encountered while using emacs have been root caused to lsp-mode and lsp-ui. I am wondering if more experienced emacs users have an opinion on these two different packages (or sets of packages in the case of lsp-mode, dap-mode, lsp-ui). I am interested to hear about feature parity and stabability - and also using eglot when editing remote files with tramp.
 Also as an aside, it would be great to have an LSP client package added in the standard distribution of emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I'm again (tried this before but ended up leaving this since I couldn't get it working) trying to use Emacs as my "IDE". I'm a evil user, but I don't believe that has anything to do with my current problem. 
 I'm trying to get LSP working in emacs. Specifically Omnisharp with Unity3D. 
 I have installed lsp-mode and the Omnisharp server through the lsp-install command. When I look for the installed servers it also states that it is installed. However, when I try to use Emacs with my Unity project I get no auto-completion for anything related to Unity things (e.g. GameObject, Transform, etc.). I only get auto-completion for my own variables and such within my script. 
 I get this error message: 
 "Warning (lsp-mode): Unable to calculate the languageId for buffer ‘acPlMovement.cs’. Take a look at ‘lsp-language-id-configuration’. The ‘major-mode’ is fundamental-mode"
 It also says something about "(Special LSP[Disconnected] company)". 
 I did read this page, but didn't find that I should need any special setup for the omnisharp server. - https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/installation/
 I assume I'm missing something in my setup, but I haven't been able to google what I'm missing or what the problem could be. 
 Could anyone here help me with this? 
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. I'm a Haskell dev, but I use Kotlin in my day job. 
 For those not familiar, Jetpack Compose is a compiler plugin for Kotlin which allows for a declarative React/VDOM style of UI programming by composing so-called "composable functions" (which is funny to me as a Haskell dev, because what is a function if not composable?) to build up the UI.
 The kicker is, at compile-time, these composable functions are eliminated -- and (as I understand it) compiled to some imperative code that updates the UI appropriately in a reactive manner as it's inputs change.
 Svelte works similarly, but for JavaScript.
 So in other words, you get something that looks a lot like a VDOM/React style UI -- but without the overhead of an actual VDOM!
 This is a fascinating idea to me, and I'd love to learn more about how such approaches work -- but at least in terms of compiler/DSL/PL-type features (basically anything that manipulates an AST), I find Haskell far easier to understand and read. So I was wondering if anyone has implemented anything similar in Haskell (or even a related language like Purescript).
 I know there's gi-gtk-declarative and Halogen (on the Purescript side) -- and while these are both excellent libraries for declarative UI programming, as far as I know, both of them are implemented via a VDOM -- not with a compilation step.
 Does anyone know of anyone who's attempted such a compile-time approach to declarative UIs in Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every year I use AoC in order to learn myself a new language, and this year I decided to land on Haskell.
 In order to have a nice user interface for myself, I used optparse-applicative in order to parse the following argument format: aoc --file <local path> | --download <session cookie of user>.
 So far so good, but then I faced the following problem. The following snippet, which should work, returns a 400 error code and indicates that my access failed:
 readFromUrl :: String -> IO String readFromUrl session -> do now <- getCurrentTime let expires = addUTCTime (days 30) now cookie = Cookie "session" session expires ".adventofcode.com" "/" now now False False True True jar = createCookieJar [cookie] opts = defaults & cookies ?~ jar response <- getWith opts "https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1/input" return $ Char8.unpack $ response ^. responseBody 
 I am kind of in a loss about why this doesn't work, and the internet or documentation doesn't seem to give me a clue about why (or what part of) my way is wrong. Could youp lease point me in the direction of a documentation that would help me?
